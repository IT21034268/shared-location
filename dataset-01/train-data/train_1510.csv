5,Unbelievable,"A brilliant video of a master judo player. I have never seen, in person, a person with this level of skill. He's 70+ years old on the video and he's tossing guys around like rag dolls. As best as I can tell, they were really trying to throw Mifune, though unsuccessful. The quality isn't the best, but it was good enough for me. Anyone who is interested in judo, jiu-jitsu or bjj would benefit a great deal from this tape. (Though much of the groundfighting is old news for pure bjj practitioners.)"
2,Didn't Work Out Good,"I bought this with the intention of inserting it in the same bucket as the one that I put the Bucket Boss 56 Pocket Tool Organizer onto. When I put it inside, I learned I couldn't fit my larger tools into the inside pockets (the pockets used for the larger tools) of the organizer because the stacking tray made too tight of a fit. Maybe having a deeper bucket might solve the problem."
3,Not Quite So Fast,"I recently bought a Bucket Boss organizer with 56 pockets. I subsequently received a follow up email from amazon that I might liketo ""accessorize"" my purchase with one of the items in the email.The yellow plastic divider CANNOT be used on a bucket which has the tool organizer on it. The thickness of the interior canvas makes it impossible to put the divider into the bucket. I do not know if this applies to the seat unit...anybody tried it...denny"
4,Ingenious pieces of plastic,"Although I am not too fond of the price that Bucket Boss is getting for these handy trays, I own about half a dozen of them. That's because they work so well!The other reviewer pointed out the weight problem when over loaded. This is very true.My buckets usually sit in my storage building full to the brim with assorted yet sorted fasteners. I can find what I am looking for rapidly by just lifting the stacking trays one at a time and giving a quick glance."
5,Handy Storage,"I carry a lot of different types of fasteners and the boxes they come in tend to come apart in the back of my truck. I bought two different sizes of these trays and they work great. I break down the screws, nails into different buckets, different sizes in different trays. Beats the heck out of trying to fish the pieces out of the bottom of the truck. These are much more compact, lighter weight than my old shop built storage bins, plus they're easier to move around at the worksite."
1,save your money,"Unfortunately this video is a rip off on Oyama's reputation. To begin with almost half the video is of fighters other than Oyama, then adding insult to injury the video is shot in PAL format so that you can't clearly see a good 5 minutes of a 23 minute tape. Ok so do the math, half the tape is not Oyama and but some other fighters from other commercial tapes (such as The Strongest Karate)5 minutes are shot in PAL which leaves you with 6 minutes of Mas Oyama. These last 6 minutes contain tensho, and tekki 1 photographed from an angle that takes away any technical knowledge. Save your money look for tapes from japan that are not commercial rip offs with out value. I suggest you do not buy this tape."
1,waste of time and money,This is one of the worst karate video's I have seen. Print quality is extremely poor.
5,he writes for his reader but also for himself.,"In response to the reader who believes that Barth is not a ""heavy hitter."" I believe he is sadly mistaken. Barth writes his novels intelligently and with great alertness for exactly what he wishes to connote to his reader. Beyond his attention to his reader we can also see that he is very expressive in putting himself in his novels. Pynchon, whom i find to be dull, insipid, and elitist, may be considered to be a hard hitter by some, but I believe to be sadly lacking in that he does not take into account the feelings of readers."
5,Humorous view of American colonial mores,"The outrageous adventures of Ebenezer Cooke, poet and virgin will keep you laughing. Admittedly, the first hundred pages tend to drag, but once Eben boards the ship for the New World, the book is non-stop laughs. The portrayal of the cavalier attitude toward morals and the hypocrisy inherent in the Puritans gives great joy to the reader. The privy journal, once revealed, also delights"
5,America's greatest living writer,"The novel that proves that post-modernity is only a viable philosophy when it makes you laugh. When I read the pretentious reviews of more aggressively 'famed' authors, it is always pleasant to enjoy the wry smile of a Barthist. Our man always seems to have got there first and then said it better."
5,An awesome talent.,"If you like Pynchon, you'll like Barth. Rich, powerful stories come together like chocolate and peanut butter. Wow."
2,empty pyrotechics,"John Gardner, in his (excellent) _On Writers and Writing_, mentioned this book so he could have an example of ""empty pyrotechnics"" -- he couldn't have made a better choice. The book is indeed profoundly empty; it contains no life, nor anything taken from life.The characters give entertaining speeches, and are doubtless well pleased with themselves; but why should I spend the hours of my own life reading it? Barth's skill with words is impressive; that doesn't make him a great writer, any more than being fast made Herb Washington a great ballplayer.Some praise its knowledge of history; I would say, rather, that it demonstrates the distinction between knowing some facts about history and knowing something about history worth communicating."
2,Confusing and sophomoric,"I didn't really get this book. I found it too long and almost boring. The plot is so complicated that I gave up on following it. At the same time some parts of it, especially near the end, completely strain credibility. The idea that some people, despite having notable physical characteristics, would be able to repeatedly diguise themselves so completely that even close friends could not recognize them is ludicrous. The frequent philosphizing of the book, while not annoying, tends toward the sophomoric. Above all, I found the book to just too pointlessly scatalogical. I know it is supposed to be funny, but I doubt if I laughed aloud once. (Yes, I do have a good sense of humour, and no, I am not a prude)."
1,Tiresome and self-indulgent,"Barth surely had great fun writing this book, but it is far too long and self-indulgent with all sorts of behind-the-hand snickering at the author's tricks and wiles. Not recommended."
1,NLP for Skiing,"I'm not a fan of NLP in the first place, but NLP for skiers? If you know NLP, there is really no need to read this book. Just apply what you know to skiing. I think NLP is alot of hokus pokus. There is one thing that is true in this book and that is you can't be using the conscious mind when skiing. But that applies to every sport. The more you practice, the more it becomes automatic and the better you are at something."
3,"Good, but not perfect","I just received my cutoff fence and assembled it to the instructions. I measured the width from the angle to the fence surface. It measured 1.045. That was a little to much for me. I then took my toolmakers square and found out that the aluminum angle was out of square. The fence does have an adjustment screw to correct this, but it is to adjust the out of square in only one direction. My fence was out the other way. To make a long story short I removed the angle and sanded it square and to the right thickness on my delta 12"" with 80 grit paper. The fence was .760 and the angle is now .240 = 1.000. One thing I forgot to mention, after you drill the fence material make sure you counter sink the holes so when you mount the angle that it sits real flat."
4,For Safety,"It scores for function and safety but I had to remove excess paint to make it parrallel to the fence. This also improved the thickness dimension from over 1-1/32"" to 1-1/64"". It should be considered an essential tool for safety. I had the bruises to prove it after years of dumb luck."
4,A must have,"I must agree with another reviewer. This is a must have safety product.This should come with a saw like a miter gauge. You must either build one or purchase this one. Don't wait until you need it for a project because you might find yourself just being extra careful on that cut like I found myself several years ago. I pride myself on being safe in the shop and in life in general. I ,however, cross cut a 1 x 4 using the rip fence one too many times and found myself with two nice little bruises on my belly. It hurt like crazy. I knew better and had heard Norm say not to do it several times. I now know why. I didn't want to spend the money on the device. Please don't hesitate to purchase this product. I was lucky to only have three bruises, two on my belly and one directly to my pride. Four stars because it is nice perfectly one inch."
3,Link to PDF Product Manual is Wrong,"This is not a review. This is just a bit of information for a potential buyer who may be looking for additional information on the 78-939 Cut-Off Stop product.The link on this product description page, to the PDF product manual is wrong. Instead of taking you to the 78-939 Cut-Off Stop for T-Square Fences product manual, it takes you instead to the Biesemeyer T-Square Miter Saw Table Instruction Manual. This is kind of sad since I was interested in obtaining a lot more information about the Cut-Off Stop than was given in the sparse product description. I gave the product 3 stars because I had to rate this item to get the review published and I didn't want to be unfair.I informed Amazon about this problem months ago but I see that nothing has changed."
2,The Magic is Gone...,"The album that got me hooked on Crazy Penis was their first - ""A Nice Hot Bath With..."". At the time, I thought they were in the Big League of downtempo/chillout, along with Solid Doctor, Fila Brazillia, The Irresistible Force, Nightmares On Wax, and the like. And they certainly had the sound to walk with their head high among equals. Sadly, with every consecutive album, they've been regressing, until, with their last two albums, they've devolved into generic commercial trash-dance filler music. No originality, no soul, nothing to remember. Sad..."
3,A step behind,"Although the dance-funk-electro influences can get tiring at times, overall this generous serving of second-tier dance creativity files nicely under Jamiroquai opening act."
5,Must Have for the Photo or Outdoor Pro,This little number is a charm to have for outdoor spotting or just everyday photography its compact and versatile. Thank You to the person who invented it.
2,"Mostly plastic, not going to hold a ton of weight","This is a neat idea but keep your use of this object to small items. This is not a grip department tool. It's a consumer grade handy toy. I have put a go-pro on it, a flip cam, etc. Anything of weight (esp a DSLR) and prepare for disaster."
5,ABCs of Wisconsin,"As a collector of children's books and a native of Wisconsin, I found this book delightful. Alison Relyea has a real gift for connecting reality with fantasy. Love the book. Love the art. Thanks, Alison. AvaOne"
1,The facts are in the back of the book!,"If you are looking for serious facts about Wisconsin, don't buy this book. Although the illustrations may be whimsical, most of the facts could pertain to any state--there's poison ivy in North Carolina too. All of the factual information is contained on two text-only pages at the back of the book, and children are not going to sit still while Mom reads these facts to them. Having grown up in Wisconsin, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was extremely disappointed."
2,TAKE WARNING,"This is a totally different band. For all of you who hold No Rules, or Keasbey Nights dear, I warn you to brace yourself for this new release."
5,different but good,i've always been a fan of catch 22 (especially since one member comes from my town) and Washed Up ...although different still had catch 22 quality so any fan of catch 22 be sure you get this
4,Mr.,"Good but its a bigger physical size than what I needed. I had a snap on welder, turnes out I had to replace all IC 16 pin chips. Now it works."
3,Homeowner,"It's OK, but not definite enough for all repair works. Like there is no mentioning of the speedometer sending unit or how to the front wheel bearing is repaired."
5,Corelle hearthstone dinner ware,I bought a few pieces of this dinner ware because it can go in the microwave. It's also quite attractive and reasonably priced. Very nice additions to my hand made dishes which are not microwave -safe.
1,Poorly written. Rendered interesting stories boring. Find a better book about great African Americans,"This book is one of the worst writings I have ever read. The author begins each bio with bad prose, extolling the virtue and greatness of the person to be described. It's actually an insult to the 100 African Americans listed, as though their acts were not really great enough to stand on their own by simply describing what they accomplished. Rather, the author must first wax poetic (badly) about how wonderful they were before even telling you what they accomplished. Was there not enough that could be said about their deeds to fill a book without pages of useless filler?If anyone knows of a really good book of mini biographies of great Black Americans I would appreciate your telling me about it. Because I'd love to read their stories. Unfortunately, I could not read about those accomplishments in this book. It made me gag."
2,Lint trap,Good looking shirt but attracts lint. I washed it one time and the black lint from the shirt sticks to the white and white to the black. Keep a good lint roller on hand with this shirt.
5,Little Box of Horrors review,i love this band and this is good box seta must have for wednesday 13 fans
4,Left Me Wanting A Follow Up,"After seeing all the five star reviews I decided to give this a watch. The footage is powerful and impactful. When the focus was on the former child-soldier, Ishmael Beah, you are left feeling a sense of ""western-guilt"". This kid tells these horrific stories of death, chaos, and greed, then brings a smile to his face, because of the gratefulness he feels for being alive. The focus of the documentary should have rested more on his storyline. At the very least, there should have been more conversation between Ishmael and the musicians about the potential they have to change the attitudes towards diamonds. The musicians that traveled with him to Sierra Leone came across as shallow and selfish, only superficially impacted by the horrors being presented to them. The film ends and you have this uneasy sense that these musicians are going to return to the United States and leave the misery behind."
3,Interesting documentary.,probably won't change the world but interesting look at the diamond trade business. it was ok. i won't discourage other from seeing it but i won't be recommending that anyone rush and put it in their wishlist either.
5,"Have you seen Blood Diamond, then i recommend this one too!","Good impression of Sierra Leone post-war. I like the way they they connected the Bling from the Hip-hop industry with the suffering of the people from Sierra Leone.Must see, if you want to know more about blood diamonds en the story behind it.cheers,Bram"
2,The King is Dead,"True story: Like a diamond in the rough, I came across this game--minus its label--on the sidewalk one cloudy day. You can imagine my surprise upon discovering that it was KOF EX, even though I've bought the sequel long beforehand. In retrospect, I made the right choice.Though basically the same as KOF EX2 in terms of graphics and functionality, EX1 is worlds apart from its successor. First, you have a total of 30 fighters to choose from; 2 are unlockable and 10 are only available as 'strikers' that you summon when in a jam. Also, compared to the sequel the inferior music and sound leaves you 'howling' in pain. Special moves seem harder to pull off, all the difficulty settings are easily beaten and the end bosses suffer from SNK Boss Syndrome.I suppose I could keep both games if only for the (slightly) different character rosters. But even that feels like a weak reason to keep this weak portable fighter.This game is rated T for Teen: Violence"
5,Try Once and Hooked,"My set is a Ludwig Blue Vistilite Kit I bought in 1976. Still in mint condition though it has been a road warrior at times. I have tried tons of drum heads from ludwig, Remo, many I don't even remember, but these Evans hydraulics are the best sounding, longest lasting heads I have ever put on it. They last and last, and I play hard, I mean Led Zep, Metallica, Black sabbath hard. The tune up very nice and stay there, more to do with the kit I know, but when I move them from inside to outside and back, Ilet them sit for at least fifteen minutes to acclimate. In the past a lot of heads need tuning from th etemp varince, not these, theyadjust to the temp and I am ready to rock. The oil filled heads give a deep and loud yet snappy tone. I use one gel pad on each head to dampen and that's it. Whether live in the studio at home, or outside on stage, these heads perform. It would take a lot to convince me to use anything else. I'm hooked."
3,Lights Camera Action,"I am a beginning Photographer. I found this book accidentally and I like it. He is telling you to know your subject: their personality, quirks, etc. It's not about gloss and phoney smiles.It is a good beginning to learn about photography. Your not photographing apples and oranges, you are photographing people in the most natural way.E. Wizzola"
4,Context is everything,"The author described this book (in another one of his books called ""13 Books"") as a rare, serendipitous project where all the pieces coalesced into the best and most critically-acclaimed of the 13 books he has produced. Overall, I liked it because it helped me understand and appreciate a non-Western (anti-Western?) aesthetic [""Wabi-sabi is a beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete; a beauty of things modest and humble; a beauty of things unconventional""], but I did not see the cult-classic magic in it. It's interesting and insightful but I actually found13 Bookseven more interesting and insightful."
4,Beauty in the imperfect,"I liked the book overall. The simplicity of the book itself went with the theme. I am a visual person and would have liked to see the pictures in color, although this may have also been Wabi-Sabi. I enjoyed the cultural background. I bought a copy for myself and as a gift."
2,A slim skim,"Perhaps if I had read this book before I readWabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanenceby Andrew Juniper, I would have a higher opinion. Things being as they are, I found this to be a quick read with very little depth. I would highly recommend the Juniper book instead."
5,"A General, Intellectual Introduction--Readable.","This book sets forth the attitude of wabi-sabi in simple, logical characterizations and arguments--easy on the western ear. It is very compelling, very short, and very stylish. It makes a great gift."
4,Wabi-Sabi 101,A good introduction to the history and basic concepts of Wabi-Sabi. It has good examples that are relevant to our culture and lifestyle. I wish it had better photos. But overall I recommend it.
2,"If less-is-more, then the book is a good example of wabi-sabi","The Japanese are famous for insisting that the nuances of their culture and language cannot really be conveyed or translated. Most cultures would say the same. This is a reflective article on the concept of wabi-sabi, packaged and priced as a book. I knew a little about the concept when I ordered the book, and a very little more when I finished it."
2,"Wabi Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers",I wanted information about Japanese art practice. This book said that the practice known as Wabi Sabi is very mysterious and then proceeded to make it even more mysterious. I wanted help in explaining the practice but this did not enlighten me and did not provide that help. I do not recommend this book.
3,no wasabi wabi-sabi,"some how wanted more -- expected more . . . It was either not long enough, or too long, if you see how I mean . . . there must be some other book . . . I'll be looking . . ."
5,"Simple, beautiful","This is a wonerfully crafted book of basic definitions for those who have never heard the term Wabi-Sabi. The pictures not only strengthen the points the author makes but also illustrate what he can't put into words. Wabi-Sabi is an aesthetic that mostly lives in the ditches, basements, and out-of-the-way places of modern American society. This book gives the license and some philosophical tools to explore the simple life as a thing of beauty contrary to the glittering clutter often thrown at us in every aspect of our lives."
4,wabi-sabi for all,"Simply, tastefully, and accessibly written. A useful book for all who wish to engage with the world while they go about their business in a conscious way. If you enjoy pictures, this is not the text for you."
5,Patience is a virtue,This book is an amazing story of a monk who preservers through many many years of persecution and imprisonment. The book truly inspires.
5,Highly Recommended,"This book is a deeply moving and informative story about what has been going on in Tibet ever since the Chinese invasion and crackdown. It's a critically important story for anyone interested in the truth, in the ongoing oppression of Tibetans and Tibetan Culture, and in world affairs in general. The story of this one monk is representative of events at large. Whether you're a Buddhist or not, this book is not to be missed.There is also a documentary about Gyatso Palden, called Fired Under the Snow, and if you are lucky enough to see it , it is also highly recommdned. I met Palden Gyatso at a recent screening and was deeply touched. He is old now, but free, and has devoted the rest of his life to telling his story so we can KNOW what's going on.It is heart-wrenching but inspiring at the same time. Read it and spread the word!"
5,A truly compassionate soul,"I had the honor of meeting Venerable Palden Gyatso after having read his story. The most amazing thing to me about him was his compassion. Given the horrific experience he had in Chinese prisons over 33 years it was amazing to me how warm, honest and loving he is. Even more amazing is that his compassion is not limited to Tibetans, in fact he has no ill will against the Chinese. This book is a story about the triumph of the human spirit. Palden Gyatso's story must be heard."
2,"Router is awesome, table sucks","I love the Porter-Cable 690 series routers. They are powerful, easy to handle, and the accessories make them flexible enough to be used about anywhere. So I thought that PC would probably have a decent router table to match the fine router. Wrong. The table itself is sturdy, but the fence is useless, the miter guide and slot are sloppy, and the router plate screws are cheap and poorly aligned. With the fantastic quality of table, fence, and miter system designs that are available in any woodworker magazine, consider spending on some plywood before you waste your money on this table."
1,Router is Great - Table is a Joke,"but it *can* be made useful...I bought my PC router and table kit new (including the floor stand that is not included here) and materials to make the table top and fence useful. I threw the aluminum top and the dippy ""fence"" away and salvaged the remaining pieces for reuse with a shop-made top and fence. TIP: Buy the PC 69x router combo kit (fixed & plunge) but build your own table and fence."
5,Ultimate Router Workshop,"For the advanced hobbyist this package is a great value and great quality. I doubt Norm Abram would have much use for the table but I'm sure he has all the other items that come in this package. Not that there is anything wrong with the table it is just a litte small to be taking on larger projects but the size and portability is what made it very attractive to me. When I need it, I pull it off the shelf. WHen I don't, it's out of my way. And the quality is excellent compared to ANY other portable table on the marked. I am very pleased with the purchase and timliness of delivery ..."
1,Terrible,"This router table is terrible. The insert is about 1.5 mm below the table surface. It's impossible to use without adding 5 layers of masking tape on the lower surface to raise it. The fence is difficult to adjust.The router itself is good, but it's an older design and does not compare well to the new Milwaukee or any of the other newer models."
4,"If the table were better, the package would be 5 star","The router and the interchangeable bases are excellent. It is great to be able to switch one motor easily between 3 bases (table, D handle, and plunge). It is easy to adjust the height in the table, since it is a helical mount...just turn left or right to go down or up. The price on the package is fair.. what you are paying for is primarily the motor and the 3 bases... I estimate about [$$$]. This means you get the table for about [$$]. Thats not a bad price for the table, but its not the best table either.In summary, its a great package at a fair price. If you are looking for something to raise panels, you may want to get a variable speed router with a smooth table. For all other projects, its great and I would buy it again."
1,Porter Cable 691RS Router table,"The 691S router table is clearly not in the same league as other Porter Cable products. The cast aluminum table snags wood in the many grooves while feeding, it is noisy, due to it being all metal construction. The table oxidizes and leaves black ugly marks on my expensive wood that are hard to remove. The fence is utterly worthless, it is difficult if not impossible to align properly...."
5,The Perfect Handbook for a Preteen GIRL!,"This Book is so cool! It tells about aromatherapy, brainfreezes, how to make your own rainstorm and everything else that strikes a preteen girl. I keep the Handbook with me where ever I go!(:"
1,Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid,"Shame on you, The Dragons. You guys are just a bunch of geeks. You even are just some lame Ripoff MTV band.The title should be called ""Suck like f""."
1,cheap cheap cheap,"This was a gift for my husband. The merchandise was not even made of wood. It was made of pressed wood shavings,so when he laid on it the first time, the wheels came right thru the bed of the creeper. Cheaply made materials. Would not recommend."
1,Mechanic's Creeper,"I received this creeper yesterday via UPS. The box was severly damaged as was the creeper. One caster was missing, one caster was loose in the box and the other two were not tightened down. A piece of one corner was broken off and not in the box and one of the railings had come off of the creeper bed which had been stapled and glued. I returned the creeper to Amazon today for a refund. This is not a well made creeper and certainly not worth the $33 I paid for it. The creeper bed is made out of chip core and the casters did not look like they would stand up to even the occasional use I would have given it.Terry 6/24/09 Wisconsin"
3,It is a good research work for ethnic conflicts and politics,"I met Martin Smith at Marnalplaw, KNU headquater near the Thai Burma border. He interviewed rebel leaders and obtained the information he wanted. I am an ethnic Karen people of Burma, so I understand his hard work. It is a very good book for historians, students and politicians to understand morer about Burma."
5,"Well written, easy to read","I ordered this book for a class, it is well written. The chapters are grouped by ethnic group which makes for easy navigation. If you are familiar with psychological or counseling terminology it is an easy read as well."
1,Poorly Edited and Nothing New,"It looks like the publisher has a whole series of ""Buzz Your..."" titles, and it looks like minimal effort was put into customizing the content of this book for the promotion of digital music. Although there's a bit of general commonsense advice, this book is really just an ad for the buzzyour.com website.It's so poorly edited there are spelling errors, despite the authors admonition to spell-check every document you produce while promoting your product. There are even contradictory statements within one page! E.g., on the top of p. 22 he states ""Fliers work, and they're economical."" Later on the same page, he says, ""...pass out free tapes or CDs... This works better than flyers, which most people will throw away or ignore."" (Yes, he spelled it both ""flier"" and ""flyer"".)Save your $9 and find another book."
5,Freeman Knocking Down Walls!,"I have to say I was totally clueless about how to promote my music. I was spamming people and making lame attempts at setting up gigs but I wasn't getting anywhere. Freeman's books taught me A LOT about this business. Since I started using some of his techniques I've booked gigs for EVERY weekend and I got the local radio stations playing my singles at least a couple times a day. I also started a website and got people talking about my music on newsgroups. Don't let the title full you, this book is all about promoting music OFF-LINE and ON-LINE!! I highly recommend it!"
1,You can find this information elsewhere for free,I believe this is now outdated. I'm a bit surprised I actually bought this report. How to market your MP3 now? MySpace!
1,Not even 1 star!,I got the DVD(not the video) as a gift but it was clearly just a dupe of the video. Here the summarization: There is a 5 minute speach/introduction while two people on of which could be Otsuka is doing Kihon Kumite in the background. After the first five minutes there is no longer any commentary and the quality of the footage gets progressively worse. By the end you can barely see what is going on. This is the complete commercialization of the Martial Arts and is not worth the DVD/Video Tape itself.
1,Is it traditional? Is It Goju Ryu? Is it karate!,"As a martial arts magazine editor this is the sort of video I dread being asked to review. Its production values are poor, the ability of the performer is highly questionable, and the price asked is absurd.The general public is usually the best judge of value and so it is here. Goju Ryu Karate Kata by Morio Higaonna is rated 2,335 in the vast Amazon.com selection and was awarded 5 stars, (Goju Ryu) Power Training by the same author 6,176 and 5 stars, and Goju Technical Series Part 1 again by Higaonna, 10,984 and 5 stars. In comparison this very humble offering came in at 57,500 and in my opinion warrants no stars at all.There are martial arts video production companies out there who do produce quality videos and most of them are available through Amazon.com Sadly this is not one of them."
1,Laughably naive.,This book does nothing but reveal the author's minimal research into both James Egbert's disappearance (he ran away from home) and the AD&D game.
3,well balanced gun,"makita has produced a very comfortable gun to use.I have found it to be quite well ballanced especially when set in the lock on position, so that the trigger finger is on the upper part of the gun. the only draw back is that you have to remove the tip to remove screws. we will have to see how it holds up to the test of time."
1,Poorly Built and spins too fast,"I am truly disapointed with the 6825. My belt clip has already broken off after two days work. The nosecone is cheap and will not hold up. Also, the 6000 rpm's are burning up my tips. I will certainly stay with my other dependable and tough DeWalt screwguns."
1,Save your time,"This is not a good try for MAkita - My belt holder broke within 1st week. The nosecone must be adjusted back in order to remove screws, otherwise the clutch will not engage. Fortunately I got the makita rep to exchange it for a cordless drill after I screamed for having to pay 26.00 for a new belt clip."
5,I love it,This book is amazing. It also came to me in good shape. The Jesus urgent message for today is one of my requirement for my theology class.
3,Alright.,"Although this boardbook had many pages to it, the pictures were not varied enough to be very interesting. Basically, this little boy carries a book around with him for the entire day. Each page show him doing something different with the book against a gradient colored background. And, there is a cat that comes and goes through the story. Not much more to say."
2,Retired,"I go away for about a week every winter and I was concerned about my furnace possibly failing and my water pipes freezing. I purchased the first home freeze alert and I tested it by installing it in my garage where the temperature was cold and it worked fine. The temperature was below 42 degrees and I got the tone like I should have. I then used it for a couple of winters when I went away. I assumed it was working as it should have. When I finally got around to testing it again, I realized that it was not working. I purchased another one for $38.00 and the new one has done the same thing. I do not recommend this product for the price I had to pay. It has a two year warranty but unfortunately it was just past the warranty period each time when I realized that it was not working. It would be a great idea if I could depend on it. I also want to mention that I am writing this review but I did not purchase this product from Amazon."
4,DIE HARD on the shuttle launchpad...,"With the movie rights to IGNITION already sold, one can't help but make the jump to how much this novel reads like a screenplay waiting to be filmed. It is a suspense filled action thriller -- fast paced, with meticulous attention to detail, especially concerning the Kennedy Space Center, weapons and scientific details. We would expect no less from this team of writers who have made popular names for themselves in the science fiction arena -- and now cross genres to share their skills with a whole new audience. The dialog and characterizations get better in each of their books, and if you thought you knew all that could go wrong with a NASA shuttle launch -- this story will make you think again"
1,Horrendous,"This book was extremely badly written. The characters all have a big ego and the worst dialogue. The plot seems interesting at first but becomes an even-worse-than-B-movie plot. I hoped it would be good because I'm a huge K.J. Anderson fan but this was horrible (right next to Ai! Pedrito!). Hopefully both of these terrible novels were because Anderson wasn't working alone.Instead I highly recommend Hopscotch and Captain Nemo, both by Anderson."
5,A non-stop action thriller,"What was amazing to me about this story was how plausible it was actually made out to be. And to that degree, it is very terrifying at the apparent futility (and I say apparent) at stopping a catastrophy, such as the one Anderson and Beason propose. There are certainly enough smart crazies out there who just might have a warped sense of ""logic"" that only by destroying a space shuttle can public interest be swayed to take the space program to a level."
3,"Ignition is a solid read, with some flaws","The scenario postulated in Ignition isn't too far fetched, and Anderson and Beason do a credible job fleshing the story out...It's an exciting story that kept me up half the night reading it...Of course, it's hard for me to picture a guy with a broken foot trying to take out every terrorist in sight, but that's just one flaw I saw in the storyline...The other obvious flaw was the the replacement commander had been a mission specialist on three previous flights...Not likely to happen, as they mention prior to that that each shuttle commander had at least two missions as a pilot under his belt...Also, it seemed kind of pointless to move the Launch Control Center and the Vehicle Assembly Building, which sit right beside each other. Unlike the Russian space launch facilities, Kennedy Space Center is a major tourist attraction as well as a national asset.Overall, though, Ignition is definitely worth a read..."
3,A Fun Read!,"Terrorists seize control of the Kennedy Space Center and one shuttle. It's up to one man to stop them! It's the familiar ""Die Hard"" formula once again.Anyone picking up this book expects a light fun read with lots of action. The authors, Kevin Anderson and Doug Beason, know this and so that's what they give us. Lot's of guns, lot's of baddies and lot's of bang for your buck."
2,Die Hard Lite,"Not his best writing to date. I would equate the story as a ""Die Hard Lite."" Half the action and suspense without all the calories. I found the villian to be a regurtitated Hans-like villian ala Die Hard, with all the gun toting half-cocked henchmen in tow. The plot was intriguing in holding the astronauts and space shuttle hostage. The story fails in a predictable plot, a improbable hero, and tired ending. I'd recommend this book for beach reading only."
4,"A good, fun read.","OK, folks. I know the book had many cliches and predictable plot twists. Actually, I didn't know until after I finished the book that it was being made into a movie, but while I was reading, the similiarities between Ignition and any number of action movies did cross my mind. However, when I picked up the book I knew I wasn't picking up a particularly cerebral book, but an action thriller, just like the cover said. I liked the way the book took us on a virtual tour of (a somewhat deliberately modified version of) the KSC, and the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Lots of action, even if it did get somewhat predictable. I felt the Jacques-Yvette incest thing was pretty pointless, didn't contribute anything to the story, and probably should have been axed by the editor. Still, I'd recommend the book for anyone looking to have some fun reading a book."
1,Disappointing,"I have seen all of this video, except for the last comedy on the tape: ""Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life."" Very unfunny stuff, I'm sorry to say -I do like slapstick comedy, but this collection didn't do anything for me. (I have also bought the DVD set called ""Slapstick Encyclopedia,"" - these volume 2 comedies are on the DVD set, too - so I haven't given up.)"
1,Cheapo,"This is just plain cheap-o junk. Really For the price of this kit and the price of the vacuum, I would expect alot more. I don't even know where to begin. Poor fitting, sloppy and poorly designed too. Yuck."
2,Adequate tools; poor value,"I am disappointed in the Fein tool kit for the following reasons: the devices are lacking a basic positive-lock connection feature (often incorporated in the form of that classic little round-topped chrome button that springs up into a hole on the mating piece), and they generally are (aside from the floor attachment and chrome tubes) very light gauge material. I have a ... little Eureka ""Mighty Mite"" compact vacuum, and its tools are actually more substantial than the supposedly ""industrial grade"" Fein products. Ultimately I imagine these accessories will work fine, but I am actually amazed at the high price relative to what is provided. ... Final complaint - I really can't imagine that anyone who orders the Fein vacuum cleaner wouldn't want the tools - they should come with the machine. Separating them out seems to be a way of keeping the machine's cost down - ultimately an artificial savings."
2,Has Fructose in it! Bad for yeast overgrowth!,"I have to go to another website to read all information on this product: dosage, servings, active and inactive ingredients. If you have a yeast problem, fructose/sugar is not recommended, otherwise I would have ordered it. Also, a bit pricey!"
1,I'm outraged,"I saw this product yesterday in a Christian Book Store for the first time. I was surprised to see Christians imitating secular world creating a new violent/aggressive action figure and trying to let others believe that this is God's and Jesus' teaching. But what REALLY made me angry was to see that one of the evil character's name is ""El Furioso"", ""The Furious One"" in Spanish. Now Christians are not only trying to sell violence to children as a good, but also teaching that if someone's name is in English, is ok; but Spanish is evil. I thought we were suppose not to be conformed to this world. - Rev. Walter Acevedo-Olivencia"
3,Orbit Pick,"well i bought this to play my bass with. it felt great and played just as well. about 45 minutes into playing with it the pick itself broke where they drilled the hole out to fit the grip piece. maybe i was picking too hard, and that may be why it broke. other than it being weak, it was great."
2,"ZeroGravity Orbit Guitar Pick, Medium Single",The material is too stiff and forces the pick too far out from my finger. It is also more 'stiff' than a dunlop .60mm
2,Interesting idea. Bad reality.,"I play tenor banjo, and there's a lot of high-speed strumming involved. I'm mostly a finger picker on 5-string and guitar, so I don't have the most reliable grip for strumming. I thought this pick would give me the confidence to wail on the tenor banjo without worrying that my pick would go flying (again). But the flimsy loop, pick angle and overall dimensions just don't work. I tried putting the loop on different fingers, putting the pick on upside-down and twisting it to reduce the length, even putting the loop on my thumb. I just couldn't find a configuration that felt secure and put the pick at the correct angle for me. Bummer."
3,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a green one, but i got a red one. Besides that, I was thinking it would be of better quality than this. Some areas the plastic is melted and kinda feels like it would fall apart. I usually just use my fingers for strumming and picks for single note picking. Unless you enjoy awkward angles for picking, this is strictly for strumming."
3,you might like it......?,"this is neat...this would be good anytime youre playing...its not going anywhere.ive seen alot of players drop picks while performing,they pause and grab for another taped to a mic stand...different gauges,and a changable pick would be nice..a bit pricey considering you can purchase a dozen for same price.if your gonna get one,do it from here,as ive seen it priced other places for twice as much,or more...if you have to hold it at an angle your not used to,dont get it,no point in changing style.i contacted the company,and they do sell in bulk,but no discount...so try a couple before ordering alot of them."
3,"Great idea, probably just not ""one size fits all""","Definitely helps not dropping pick and consistent holding, but the pick is a little too thick for my liking and the grey circle part gets in the way a bit when strumming fast if you start to lose control of the pick. I'm no expert guitarist though, so give it a shot..."
1,Don't buy it..,"I was very interested when I saw it online but I was very disappointed when I got it. The pick looked really crappy and did not feel like it was different from regular picks. It had some stain on the rubber part and it looked disgusting. If you think this pick will help you improve your skills of using pick, you would be wrong. If you keep practicing, this pick would be useless.Also, when I asked for refund, I got rejected because they said the pick was not defective. I offered to show the pictures of the pick I got from them but they didn't even wanna see the picture and just drew the conclusion that the pick was not defective."
1,Wank fest in your face.,"I am a huge Mars fan, but this is just bore. I was really looking forward to a cd representive of their live shows, but this is a horrible excuse for a live album from anyone especially from Mars Volta.I am all for experimentation, but if you look at the liner notes there are a ton of non-band members jerkin' off on this after the original recording and personally coming from a recording and engineering backround it is not creative or good. It seems like a bad painting.Save your money and buy bootleg of their actual live show."
1,If you are looking for an accurate documentation of what they sound like live... then THIS IS NOT IT!!!,"I LOVE Volta, in fact I own all of their albums and saw them live at Klondike Days back in 2005. They were AMAZING. The Mars Volta are one of the most influential bands ever.However, I did not hear anything good here. The sticker on the packaging brags ""Over 70 Minutes Of Live Music"" which is really an oxymoron in essence when you think about it. 50% of it is just sound effects, and Omar wankering around with the sound machine. OK Omar, we get it, your music is really trippy. Plus the production is horrible, the album sounds like it was produced in a toilet (pun intended). PLus whatn happened to Jonnie's drums? They sound like friggin' cardboard boxes."
3,Scab Dates,"The Mars Volta is one of my favorite bands and the passion they have for their music and their talent overwhelms me every time I listen to their music, so needless to say I'm not here to hate on the album. I'm not suggesting that this compilation of their live music is bad, but I feel that having seen the Mars Volta live three times in the past six months...it just doesn't come anywhere close to doing them justice (especially in Cedric's case). Their live performances are literally life-changing and so much more captivating than the tracks on this CD. Surely, this is a must have for those of us crazzzy fanatics who have to own every single one of their releases, BUT HONESTLY, go see them live. It will leave you far more engrossed than this album will."
5,At The Drive In...... Who?,"I am a big fan of at the drive in. And very disappointed when they split up. But for the first time i am glad they split up, or else we wouldnt have this album. Even though some of the songs i have heard before, they are completly different. On selection 11 Cedric says ""Aver Confesa Omar"" then Omar starts to sing with his guitar. You cant help but to listen and drool. Now with couple of great albums they are the best band out right now. The Mars Volta is on their way to become one of the greatest bands ever."
4,This is What Jam Bands Should Sound Like,"Firstly, I'd like to say that this would be a five star album without the annoying overdubs. However, the actual concert expands the songs into huge, power driven jams but still is focused. The band wears its influences on its sleeve: Zeppelin, Santana, Sonic Youth and yes even 70's Miles. However, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and Mars Volta are really this great live. Unlike jam bands, the members of Mars Volta seperately and as a group know how to play. There are not endless solos that go nowhere or boring guitar wankery. The hypnotic feeling of Electric Ladyland or Bitches Brew is given a modern update. Recommended."
3,not as good as the real deal,"This is not quite as good as I expected it to be, but it is still a good listen. I felt that there were not enough tracks on this and that there are many great songs that were absent. If you are a true fan of TMV than you can appreciate this album more than someone just getting into the band. In my opinion, having seen this band perform 5 times now, this album doesnt do them much justice in showcasing their live performance. Not one of their shows are similar to their others. I have seen them on back to back nights and the show is never the same. So this album isn't so much of a disappointment as some people might think, it just seems like putting together a great live album by this band is not possible. The actual live performance just cannot be duplicated on an album. If you have not seen TMV live, than do yourself a favor and go!"
5,Great album but not for everyone,This album is a great prog psych contribution to TMV's already great catalougue. I would say that if you got into the mars volta because you like oldschool prog such as king crimson then you will dig this album. As far as the actual live performances go they sound very vintage they remind me of a cross between early caravansari era santana and bruford era king crimson. The album is very trippy and mixes live performances with a collage of different soundscapes. The only beef i have with the album is that being a drummer i couldnt help but notice that bonham like drummer Jon Theodore is somewhat buried back in the mix.
2,Just can't get into THIS album,"I was absolutely amazed by Deloused, been a little less amazed by Francis and Ap, but Scab dates almost made me not buy the brilliant Bedlam in Goliath. It just sounds like something a couple of stoned kids that can't play instruments would make. Just too much random noise. I've seen them live and don't remember anything as bad as most of this. Avoid and wait for a proper live album."
5,Page Turner!,"I began reading this book and couldn't put it down! I really got into the characters. Great read, looking forward to reading book 2 and other books by Pensacola Helene."
4,Informative,Planning on doing my own mexican tile work in my home...adding tile around a fireplace and above the kitchen oven. Great instructions...I feel more confident already!
4,A Girl's Perspective,"I received this drill as a gift from the father of my then-boyfriend about 5 years ago. Through the years I have used it for everything from building my cats a jungle gym to drilling holes in shelves to small repairs. This is the PERFECT power tool for any household job. Makitas may be a little more expensive, but they're worth it in power, durability, and design. I also can't tell you how impressed men are when the learn I have one. :-) If you're in the market for a cordless to have around for years, this is your product."
4,Great Product,"I have had this drill and two batteris for 8 years with no problems. Have lost about 20% of battery life over the years of abuse, but am very satisfied. When I say abuse, I mean drilling masonry, oak, using the handle as a hammer, that kind of abuse. It's a great product!"
4,Great Game,"This is a great game. It contains superb graphics, effects, and game play. The only downside, is there are some moments where there seems to be no story line, all in all 9.5/10. Well worth the purchase."
3,"Fun, but a bit short considering the premium price","This game ran well on my 4 year old Pentium 4, 6800 Ultra, machine. The same machine totally choked on Crysis. I felt Timeshift was a little short, less than 10 hours. The play reminded me of the original Half Life with respect to big hokey buttons to push and levers to pull to make things happen. Some of the weapons seemed unsatisfyingly uneffective, with entire clips needed to down an enemy while other weapons were deavestating. The quad vehicle was a joke, at least on my computer, it was very difficult to steer and run, and there was almost no motor sound until you let up on the throttle and then you got a little fart sound. All the other sounds were fantastic (I have a Turtle Beach sound card and 5.1 surround). I had no crashes, the game played smooth and like a movie."
3,Timeshift,"The game is alright. FPS with a little something extra. Its beautiful. I dont like the idea of solely relying on time shifting capabilities though. you cant win without using them every 3 seconds. you can barely fight without it.Despite that, looks good and its innovative to a point."
4,Fun in a box,"Fun in a box. This is one fun FPS - variety of beautiful environments, decent storyline, selection of weapons to suit the task. Runs well and stable on non-cutting edge hardware (P4 D, 3 GHz., 2 GB Ram, NVidia 7800GT) with medium-high settings. The only gripe I have is it was too bloody short and I was left yearning for more. I finished it in two sessions on elite difficulty. Don't expect an epic adventure, but worth the current purchase price."
4,Fun Game - for beefed up PCs only,"I remember playing the first demo for this game a year or so ago. This final version has greatly enhanced graphics from that demo. If you don't have a powerful PC, then I would not recommend this game. Also, the installation program advises you to download the ""special"" Timeshift NVidia video driver - DON'T DO IT! Its really not necessary and it will mess up your system if you are running video in SLI mode.Despite the goofy install, the game is worth playing. The timeshift gimmick is fun and some of the levels are challenging without being too frustrating."
1,Timeshift has Securom DRM,"Timeshift was an OK game, but it comes with SecuROM v7 (v1.0: v7.33.0017 / v1.2: v7.34.0014). Deleting Securom off my machine took third party utilities and too much time. I now check games out to see if they have Secrom on them and will NEVER again buy any game with Securom on it."
3,OK -ish game,"This game was OK to play, although it lacked something to give it a real edge. The time shift function looked like it was going to be cool, but in the end it was just another button to press when he story was getting a little weak.The graphics engine was also a bit weird looking. It made everything look kind of grainy, a sort of reverse Bio Shock which was all hazy..All in all slightly better than average I'm afraid."
2,Time to step away,"The Graphics are very good. Sound is Ok and the controls are fine but the game play is too linear and uninspired. Maybe it was designed by commitee. Another bad point is the plagiarism of another game. After about 30 minutes of play I realized this game is very much like parts of Half-Life 2, only not as interesting. The voice of the propogandist even sounds like the one in HL 2. The time shift properties add some interest, but, overall it is a rather insipid game. The game designers need to make the stories interesting, to draw you in so you care about the characters and what happens. If you have not played very many 1st person shooters it will be fine, otherwise it's ""been there done that"". OK for $15."
1,DO NOT BUY-FILLED WITH BUGS,"We have a fairly new computer with windows xp and a graphics card which meets the specs listed on the box and we cannot get this game to run. It installs, but then when you ask it to run, it flashes for a second and then dies. After doing some extensive research this is a common problem. Some people have managed to tweak their computers in order to get this game to run. We have not. I'd seriously advise against wasting any money on this game. Even with the latest patches, we still cannot get it to run. This is apparently what is happening generally when attempting to adapt xbox/playstation games for the computer- they are sent out there with a lot of bugs. Good luck!"
4,Fine Product but Incomplete,"This charger works fine; the phone settles right into it without a problem. Presumably this can save wear and tear on the circular power port on your phone (this uses the two copper ""fingers"" to supply power). With other devices I've owned, I've seen those circular ports wear out with time.When purchasing this item I failed to read the fine print. This is a ""cradle"" only. While it is called a *charger*, it doesn't come with the AC adaptor needed to actually supply power to the cradle. You can use the one which came with your 3360, or (like me) shell out some more cash to buy another (that's the ""Nokia Travel Charger""). I'm a bit disappointed that for the price, there is no included adaptor."
4,six foot soccer ball,Please be aware that this is NOT a six foot soccer ball- it is a 6 foot soccer GOAL that comes with a 20 inch blow up soccer ball- didn't know this until I bought it and it was shipped. My 4 year old nephew will enjoy it just the same- but PLEASE don't be fooled by the description. Still well worth the money.
3,IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW BY MARTI WEBB,I REALLY LIKE HER VOICE BUT FELT THIS ALBUMN DID NOT DO IT JUSTICE. SHE DID A SONG IN A MOVIE THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAS NEVER RECORDED IT.
4,Product meets or exceeds expectations,"Installation was somewhat of a trick. My husband, Chuck and I purchased the blade guard system and was assured that it would attach to the Unifence. It didn't. With a newly engineered $45 bracket from Biesemeyer, it still didn't fit. A local steel fabricator created a great bracket for $110. It does its job!He complains that it is difficult to bring the right half of 4 X 8 panels back to the front due to vertical clearance limitations. Otherwise a 5 star rating"
5,Great American Girl short story!,"History, a great story and an authentic historical craft! Not only that, but just the right size for girl-sized hands. A+++++++ Cannot be beat!"
3,Cluttered and light,"Overall I liked the series however, that said:Each ""culture' he visits he spends way, way to much time on current or historically recent events along with an often pretentious monolog.Why would one ever discuss, or arrive at the British Invasion of India, or Desert Storm in Iraq, in a series subtitled 'The Origins of Civilization'?So I would call this more of a travelogue than a history program. It's not horrible but it is exceptionally lightweight."
3,Photography excellent but commentary falls short due to bias,"As a travelogue the photography is first rate with many gorgeous scenes. However I suspect Mr. Woods academic credentials and all too often his liberal political bias shines through. Sadly he cannot conceal his contempt for Christianity and Roman Catholicism in particular. Sound scholarship gives way too often to New Age intoxication. If one overlooks these flaws, one can learn a few things and be well entertained."
1,"To the moon Alice is ditto'd here, people! Yuck...","If you like predictable and boring then MAGNOLIA MOON is definately the book for you. ""Mcquire"" fans might like this one, but I sure didn't. I was disappointed in a very big way! This was my first and last JOANN ROSS book!"
2,"""To the MOON, Alice!""","MAGNOLIA MOON, along with the first two installments in the trilogy (BLUE BAYOU and RIVER ROAD) are going into my discard pile. All of the characters in these books are likeable, but the plots are shallow. One reviewer of the first installment (BLUE BAYOU) found a similarity to Nora Roberts/J. D. Robb. This similarity is even more apparent in MAGNOLIA MOON. Regan Hart is J. D. Robb's Eve Dallas down to the plain gray suit and the ""Detective Cherie."" Regan Hart is a poor substitute for the real Eve Dallas. I suggest that you give this trilogy a bye and go straight to the J. D. Robb IN DEATH series, if you haven't already."
4,Magnolia Moon,"This was very good. Author is one of my favorites. I love stories that are series about recurring characters, and this trilogy is well done."
3,Kinda boring,"Scarred LAPD homicide detective goes to LA smalltown to get answers about her real mother's ID & circumstances around her death with help from charming & woman-loving mayor who is inexplicably attracted to her.I found this Ross book tedious to read because there was too much details about history of the bayou & other characters. The writing is good but it wasn't romance-focused. The romance was not strong & not very exciting either. Heroine was portrayed as hardened & detached so her succumbing to hero's flirtatious seduction didn't fit & was not convincing. H & H just were not compatible & Ross' writing couldn't convince me otherwise.If you like location history & murder plots, this book might be interesting. As a romance novel, I don't recommend it."
4,CAN'T WAIT FOR JOSH'S STORY,"This was my favorite of the trilogy. There were so many layers to Nate & Regan, I loved discovering them. I think Nate was very dark and although appeared to be very open, was actually the opposite making him sexier and more intriguing than his brothers."
1,To the Moon is Right!,"I have heard that there is software out there for romance authors to use that basically writes the book for them. Didn't believe it when I heard it, but after reading this book by Ross, I believe it! I couldn't even finish it, it was so predictable and just plain boring. This was my first and last book by this author. I'm sticking with Nora Roberts and others of her caliber."
2,Mosaics:Inspiration and Original Projects for Interiors and Exteriors,"I love the explosion of colors that Kaffe uses, both in mosiacs and quilts . This book has a ton of brightly colored mosiac pictures in it...lots of interesting ideas...fairly good instructional pictures but all in all , I didn't like it and returned it . There was only one project (the broken pottery flower pot) that I would have even considered doing and it, too , was just to busy looking for what I was interested in doing. If you love the color explosion that always come with Kaffe projects then this book is for you. If you prefer something a little toned down , or a little structured, then this book is not for you. Hope this helps someone decide!"
2,Already Falling Apart!??!,"I LOVE this book. It's gorgeous with high-quality pages, and of course the content is phenomenal. Sadly, though, the cover comes off the book--suddenly, and all the way off--a couple of days or so after the book arrives and is taken out of the box. I've never seen such a thing before or since!Amazon.com promptly replaced my first copy of this book, but alas! The second copy did the same thing. Whatever glue was used to attach the cover to the book, has not done its job!For many months I had planned to order this book and was delighted to finally do so and receive it. Now, though, the disappointment is huge. I don't want to be without the book, but if I return this one also, would copy number 3 have the same defect?"
1,"World War One Fighters, Bombers and Scouts","This is basically a children's book, and not for the serious reader. Many facts in the book are wrong, and each aircraft only receives a one or two sentence description. Unless you have a four-year old who is interested in these planes, don't waste your money."
1,"Another ""Bodice Ripper""","The subject matter and historic background excellent, however it degenerated rapidly into ""So much Trash"", I got to page 400 and decided to call it quits!!"
5,"A beautiful story, tragic ending","The story was beautifully woven, poetic, like a tapestry of perception and feeling. I did not think it was going to grip me like it did and I thought about it even when I was not reading it. It is well worth the read no matter how badly the ending punched me in the stomach. People need to remember what it was like to persecute women who were different and honored the feminine creator."
4,very good singer,"A very good singer, although maybe not too well known. Contains his 10 inch early lp plus new material where his voice is still strong even though at a later age. Most of the material consists of slow ballads."
1,Very poor transaction.,"Same reasons as ''Piece of Cake''. We returned five DVD's in good faith to have them switched to Pal which is compatible for our New Zealand region. But no one wants to know about it, so we may as well have burn't them and saved the return shipping costs."
3,"The Spitfire was a fine airplane, and many scenes show great WW2 airborne combat.","Dialog is not very clear as spoken by Brit pilots. Screenplay drags on a bit. However, movie has some excellent air combat scenes."
2,"The book is much, much better.","This is a very short movie (79 minutes), made with total cooperation from Geoffrey Wellum himself.Photography is very good, aerial shot also. But, somwhow, the feeling of the book was not passed through the film. The final productis a very slow moving feature. Ok, it mantained the concept that the book passes, that there was no heroes, just pilots doing their best to do their duty and trying to stay alive at the same time. But... sometime is lacking."
2,Great film,"I rather liked this whole film, but my American multi-region DVD player really worked hard to play this. It handles all others, so I guess that the DVD isn't of such good quality; as on various scenes it would pause and spend seconds or minutes reloading.I loved the story and the fact that it was so real, based on living memory that contributed to the film. But the DVD was crap compared to hundreds of others from Britain and Australia that I play on my multi-region DVD player here in Texas. It's not the machine.Bloody great movie!!!"
3,Only good for the info on cameraless animation,"There are many better books out there. Much of the information in this book is very out of date. Still some good info if you want to look through it, but just don't think you're going to advance yourself greatly using it."
4,Good introduction to Animation,"I am using this book for background info for an animation unit I teach with my graphics students. It gives you a good overview of many different animation techniques. It answered a lot of my questions. This book is a good start, but you might also want to check out animation by preston blair, and Animation from script to screen by Shamus Culhane. Shamus will make an animator out of you by the end of his book."
1,BEWARE,"THIS IS A LEFT HANDED CLUB. EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T SAY SO IN THE AD OR THE ORDER INFO, IT WILL COST YOU TO SEND IT BACK. I THINK THAT'S BULL AND WILL NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
5,Tuff Gnarl!,"Great garage sound! Thee Headcoatees are an outlet for some of the prolific Billy Childish's (Thee Headcoats) overstuffed catalog of songs. These women really rock in a very fuzzy garage, and sometimes risque, way. ""Davey Crockett"" is almost poppy (as is it's Christmas version ""Santa Claus""), while ""Ballad of the Insolent Pup"" just growls (yeah, pun intended). Recommended for fans of 60's garage music, punk, and just plain good rock."
5,Wordsworth has an extremely fitting last name doesn't he?,William Wordsworth is my favorite poet. I wanted a collection of his poetry and I can't imagine a better one than this! It's so complete I don't think I'll ever need another one! I'm totally satisfied.
5,I loved this....,William Wordsworth is one of my favorite poets. This collection of his works is great. It put together really well and its easy to read and find your favorites in it. You will Love Wordsworth is much as I do!
4,Didn't splitvat Sean,"This paper held up very well during some serious sanding. In recent memory, I can't recallNOT having belt sander paper split. It didn't. Good product."
3,Clogs easily and won't clean well,"I used this to sand several different types of soft and hard woods. Is does the job, but not for long as it soon clogs up with the sanding dust. I had hoped that it would not because I believed that it was coated. Worse yet, you really can't extend it's life with the big rubber ""erasers"" because they won't remove much of the clog cakes. Sorry, I calls 'em as I sees 'em."
3,A good book through and through,"All and all a good book, it just lacks most of the secrets and info about the out of the way places, not a croud pleaser, not a blowout, all it does is tell you how to beat the game. It does give intersting detail about the characters though."
4,Good flatware pad,"This product is easy to use and easily holds service for 8; possibly ten depending on the design of your flatware. We found that our knives did not fit very well, but the product overall is good."
2,The sound quality is not very good,"I bought this CD & ""Spot The Looney"" which covers the same material. The sound quality on ""Not Another Brown Trouser Job"" is not very good. The sound quality on ""Spot The Looney"" is much better. I ended up getting rid of ""Trouser Job""."
1,A Disappointment,"I've liked previous Barbara Hazard books, but this one was exasperating. The internal conflict was silly; it was obvious that it could be resolved with one short conversation, which they (thankfully) finally had. The external conflicts were numerous but likewise trivial. It might have been amusing but I was too annoyed at the heroine's stupid behavior -- if a woman wants a man to fall in love with her, she shouldn't act like a shrew."
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME ARTIST,"I LOST THIS CD ,I'M STILL CRYING AND LOOKING FOR A NEW ONE. THIS IS JUSTGREAT ALBUM, GREAT VOICE, GREAT MUSICAL THEMES. YEAP!! A CORTA VENAS... SWEET, ROMANTICO, BELLO.DOLLY SANCHEZORLANDO, FLORIDA"
5,if you still have this phone... it was good!,good... but my phone broke though... so I don't use it anymore :-(
3,Disappointed,After reading reviews here I decided to try out this book. I expected the book to be funnier. I guess my expectations were too high since this had a 5 star review. The ending left us lacking for more.
5,Fun reading for Toddlers,"Both my 3 1/2 year old and 2 1/2 year love this book. I was first introduced to this author by another book titled ""Catalina Magdalena"" which has a catchy toon. My son wouldn't let go of that book, so while I was looking for a replacement, I found the fly guy series. This book is fun to read to them and holds their attention. I highly recommend the Catalina Magdalena book."
5,A fun book for beginning readers,My son is just getting the hang of reading. We have read many of the Hillert and Capuccilli books with great enjoyment. As I was walking through the book store I saw this book. We have enjoyed many of Tedd Arnold's books together through the years. I was thrilled when I opened this one up and saw that it would be perfect and fun practice reading for my son. At first he was skeptical that he would be able to read it alone but after the first couple pages he was reading and giggling along.Since his first reading he has wanted to share this book with others. I would highly reccommend this as a fun book to make reading enjoyable for those who are just getting into the swing of it.
3,Ok for youngers,"My 6 year old this book, my 9 year old thought it was okay. They both read it, which is great and they both found funny parts in the book which is even better."
1,Sorry,"After listining to Shujjhat I wanted to return the album,but couldnt because the wrapper was opened. I ended up giving it to someone. If one is used to listining to Ravi shankar or to a lesser extent Nikhil Banerjee then they are going to be dissapointed with the likes of Shujjhat Khan or Debu Chaudhry.The album just lacks classical depth. I do suggest Indian music lovers to acquire Ravi Shankars recordings. Another young artist who impressed me was Shahid Pervez."
5,"Read, or You Don't Deserve Words","When it comes to ""Maldoror"" you have two choices. Read it; or put out your eyes, cut out your tongue, and chop off your fingers, because you obviously don't deserve words. I'm not sure what specific lobe of the brain is responsible for imagination--Google the location, and then use an ice pick.This is, frankly, a foul text. It's as shocking as reading a 21st Century newspaper. But this was written in the late 1860s. So read it; or eyes, tongue, etc."
2,ac adapter,This ac adapter came new with my HP R707 camera that I bought in Nov. 05. Just this week the adapter just quit working. I took it to Wolf camera and they told me that the adapter was not a genuine hp product and that it can ruin the internal wiring of the camera for charging purposes. I am right now trying to find out if the wiring has gone bad. Buy genuine products!
3,"The Ghoul in School rules! Low-budget, European style.","For those of us who can't get enough of low-brow horror flicks. The girl's dorm is actually a reform-school for girls, perched on a high Alpine-type mountain. A werewolf stalks the night. The movie is a horror-mystery combination that conceals the identity of the monster until later in the film. The B&W photography is appropriately moody. The emphasis on female pulchritude recalls the Hammer horror cycle of the 1950s and 1960s, without Hammer's rich color photography. (Where's Christopher Lee when you need him?) The werewolf make-up is unfrightening enough for the local PTA ""Haunted Forest"" at Halloween. This little chiller-thriller can be taken as a harmless time-waster, or as unintentional humor. Good Halloween party tape!"
2,What a time to be alive...,"This really isn't that great a movie, but it's so nice to be living at a time when I can just walk into a Musicland or some such cultural eyesore, and buy a copy of Werewolf in a Girls' Dormitory (or Lycanthropus, as it was originally known). Video has grown immeasurably in the last few years, from a time when nearly all Dario Argento titles were out of print to a time when this film, and others like it, are widely available. The film itself is typical German exploitation. Atmospheric, enjoyable, but nowhere near as good as the Dr. Mabuse series or the Edgar Wallace films (Mad Executioners, Strange Countess), and not even comparable to a forgotten gem like The Head. A fun film for an evening of forgotten eurotrash horror, but no classic. Now where are the Mabuse and Wallace movies? When they are commerically available, then it can truly be said that we live in a golden age. Enjoy."
4,Excellent Collection of Top Notch Chill & Jazzy Trip Hop,A solid collection of excellent chill & jazzy trip hop tracks ... all nice and mellow to ease you into the day and let that caffeine work slowly on you.Track selection and transitions are excellent and there are a couple of killer tracks that are brilliant. This is just solidly great.
4,Georgia Bulldogs Towel!,"Worked Great for me, and looked amazing! Everyone loved it (and of course had to hate if they weren't Bulldog fans) which made me smile, held up just like a beach is supposed to and fit me like I wanted to as well!"
2,Mildly amusing,"Reading this book felt like watching a failed British sitcom-- the humor is ever-present, and wanders back and forth between broad, zany, and occasionally even subtle satire. Yet, the book never finds that intangible element that lends a bit of heart to the proceedings and makes a book worth reading.The characters lack dimension, which makes it difficult to care about them. The humor is sometimes funny, but more often falls flat.On the positive side, it is a light read that doesn't take too much effort to get through. A young person to whom reading does not come easily might cut their teeth on this as an introduction to humorous fantasy (although Robert Asprin's ""Myth"" series would be even better).The episodic nature also lends itself very well to bedtime reading.If you're in the mood for a light, trifling amusement, this might be right up your alley."
5,One of the funniest books I've read (and I've read a lot),"Here it is, short and sweet.Funny. Had me in stitches, tears, the whole nine yards. It's a quick read so even if you're not too sure you'll like it you won't waste much time finding out. Give it a try if you like clever writing."
5,Don't Stop Hop 'n Pop,"My son just loves this entertainment center. We bought it when he was 3.5 mo old and was just starting to hold his head up good. He did quite well in it and now just loves it. The minute we put him in it, he is busy as a bee moving stuff, swatting at the toys. It has a strap below the seat if you want to use it for smaller babies and we had been using that since he was a little small for it. Now we undid that and he fits great! It has a volume switch if you don't like the loud music but he just loves it. Plus it is so easy to fold up and take with you to Grandma's! I highly recommed this."
2,Only for skinny kids - Step & Play Piano is MUCH better,"My daughter gets bored with this very quickly. She much prefers her Step & Play Piano where she can actually move around and it has more toys. Also, she is a skinny kid and it's still hard to get her out of the toy. She sits down very low and the space between the back of the seat and the tray is VERY narrow. The only toy she really likes is the bar with the plastic toys. The rest doesn't do very much. Cute toy as an alternate for grandma's house."
1,Choking Hazard,We were very excited about this product to entertain our 5 month old who just can't stand to be laying down anymore. It was an easy toy to put together and the first couple of uses were fine. BUT-- somehow my 5 month old daughter managed to get the teething toy from the side out of the hole and choked on the stick part. I have no idea how she got it out... we checked all the others and checked to see how easy it is to take those out... it wasn't easy for us. But somehow our 5 month old got it out. We will return this product and get one that has toys built in. A little too scary!
5,Great product!!!,"My mom bought this for my 3 1/2 month old daughter. We were going to get her the Jumparoo, but she is too small for that and didn't seem interested in the toys. She loves the Hop N Pop and coos at the lights and smiles the entire time she's in it. This is a great new playstation. I wish they had it when my boys were babies."
2,Seat Size,"I really liked this product for my 4 mo. old son, the only problem is the diameter of the seat opening, it is not very big and he will not fit in it soon. (My son is in the 25% - 50% range for his age, not on the big side by any means!!) If the seat diameter was even 2"" wider, this would be a much better product."
4,Great baby item,"This toy is fantastic. We bought it for our daughter when she was 5 months old. In the beginning we bought it to help her strengthen her neck muscles. And now it is helping her to support her own weight while standing up. She loves being in her Hop and Pop, and she hasn't even discovered the concept of bouncing in it yet. I especially love how light it is, and how easy it is to fold down. I even brought it with me when I flew to Fl. My older niece (14 months) loved to stand on the outside and dance to the music.I live in a small house, and have bought all Fisher Price travel toys. It allows me to save space and to easily take them from room to room."
4,Great buy,I bought this product when my baby was 4 months old and she was not yet sitting on her own. Now she is 7 months old and she is already sitting and standing with furniture support. i think i owe her early standing to this toy. Since she is a tall baby she almost used to stand in the seat from the time i put her in the activity center. She used to like it then.. but now after 3 months I guess she loves it. She crawls to the activity center and stands up on its support and now even plays with it from outside putting the teether in her mouth and the other attached toys. The only thing though I have a question is that why does the mat have the print of a foot since by standing on it it does not play the music like the kick and play bouncer. Also our popper does not pop well with the baby's jumping. overall I am very happy with the product.
5,awsome!,"My Uncle Eric is the drummer and one of the originators of Seismic, and he is the best! This CD rocks!BUY IT!!(:-)"
5,Two thumbs up!,"Who doesn't love Annie??? It is as American as apple pie. ""Life After Tomorrow"" takes you behind the curtain to witness the real celebrations and tribulations the young actresses from the musical often encountered. It is a heartfelt examination of both the sunny days as well as the stormy weather that these child stars faced. I loved this documentary and watched it twice within the first day of receiving it. Whether you're like me and still remember almost every word to every song from Annie or you just have an interest in the effects of show business, this is a must see!"
4,Interesting...,Considering Annie is one of my all time favorites this was very interesting to see a different perspective and finally get to see who all has played the adorable Annie.
3,Interesting,Life After Tomorrow is a very interesting documentary. I liked going behind the scenes and getting to know the young ladies on the broadway play and the difficulties they faced after the play ended.
3,For the Die-Hard Fan Only,"I suppose when all is said and done, it does what it says on the cover. However, I think I was expecting maybe a bit more. Maybe some more footage from the past productions, more gossip from backstage, more interviews with other adult cast members to get their opinions on the children and their behaviour, etc. It's still a very interesting piece of theatre history and the way that something like this can affect different children in different ways - human nature, I suppose. Just lacks that certain something"
1,Get over it orphans,"This documentary is all about whining about some past glory and not having the fortitude to move on and make something of yourself. Do they honestly expect people to feel sorry for them for being on Broadway as a child. How I would have loved such a hard life! Please! And their biggest injury: watching gay people kiss. The horror! How deeply offensive. There were quite a few Annies that seem to have weathered this trauma just fine. Its a good example of different types of people; some who do indeed look to tomorrow and are happy with what life has given them, and some who choose to dwell on yesterday and create some mystical drama as an excuse for being the miserable adult they are now. Listen to the words of the songs in this beautiful musical orphans!"
5,What fun!,"Lenn Redman takes you step-by-step through the wonderful world of caricatures. By breaking down the human form, it is alot easier to draw in this manner and,even for drawing life-like images. A good book for beginning through advanced studies of all spects of drawing people.Kudos to Amazon, again for prompt service and great condition of this book."
2,I think a lot of people will be dissapointed,"This book is a dissapointment. All it tells you to do is picture a perfect face in your mind with all of the facial features the perfect size. Look at the face that you're drawing and if he/she has any facial features that are too big, you make them even bigger and if he/she has any facial features too small, then you make them even smaller. Only true beginners will benefit at all from the information stated in this book. It never tought me how to draw caricatures like the ones I see people draw at amuesment parks or the ones I see in MAD magazine. The author doesn't have the same drawing style as them. It only told me the very very basics of caricaturing, which I already knew. If I were you I wouldn't buy this book, you can learn just as much by looking at how Tom Richmond and Chris Rommel draw their caricatures at tomrichmond.com and chrisrommel.com."
3,One of the only iPod cables to offer line out audio,"Bought one of these about 3 years ago; work as advertised for my 3G FW iPod.Sik is the only manufacturer I can find that makes line out cords. I was never happy with the radio transmitters made for cars, so instead I use this cord to connect to my car radio s line in AUX feature. Great sound!On the downside, after 3 years of heavy use the cord has finally shorted out on both the FW and line out ends, so its constuction could be improved, but since its the only FW line out product I know of, I am going to buy another.BEWARE, only the line out audio feature will work for a USB type iPod. The Firewire data/power cord will ONLY work with an older Firewire type iPod."
2,Not useful anymore.,"I picked this up so that I could charge my iPod while using it with a portable amp. This was fine for that at first, but now that all iPods can only be charged via USB, this adapter's firewire port is pretty useless. Once I got a new iPod with video, I needed a new portable dock.Even if you still use an older firewire connecting iPod, there are some smaller models that do exactly what this one can do, but are about the size of a quarter."
5,Let's go pogo!,"This is the snottiest, raddest album you'll ever hear. The songwriting abilities are completely unique and the lyrical structure is outstanding. No one else could get away with the topics of these songs, because it's hit or miss, and these guys definitely hit. Listen to this repeatedly and you'll be too politically incorrect for society.There are no average trax; standouts inlude Duty Free (I wanna rip up my passport, no more nationality!), Let's Go To Jail, Rip 'Em Off, Who Cares (I wish that I was there....No I don't), Another Emergency, Tonight Tonight (this has the best break ever in a song: ""I was in the elvator the other day.."" because it doesn't make sense), and the classic, I Love You Norway [sic].I'm totally straight up when I say these guys are a better NOFX.If you like Punk in Drublic or other such albums, this will become a staple."
1,what a heap of stinking offal,"Every one seems to love the showcase showdown, and lots of people say it's original.....lets face it it's just a poor sex pistols imitation. if your gonna buy an album buy the sex pistols never mind the bollocks least that ""WAS"" original, don't bother with this heap of crap"
3,Not for Mice,"It took about 5 minutes for my mouse to find a way through the bars. The 4 corner connections were missing. Installation instructions were microscopic. Cage had doors on three sides. Looks like it would be a good cage for larger critters, just not mice."
3,Jack 62 Cage,"Good cage, more suited for a hamster. We have a rat and she didn't use any of the items that came with the cage. The water bottle would completely leak out (until it was empty). We bought a new water bottle and it works fine. The cage itself is big enough for our rat and she's happy in it (with new rat suited 'furniture' we got at a pet store). Good cage overall and we're happy with it."
3,Works fairly well,"I have had this cage for over a year now. One of the platform clips broke easily, and the wheel is cheesy. But overall it works well and I have been satisfied."
5,Important new directions in the study of D&G,"What can you do with philosophy? The essays in this collection, written by prominent theorists in cultural studies, demonstrate that the work of philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari can dramatically enrich our understanding of everyday life. Each contributor, using a variety of concepts from the writings of Deleuze and Guattari, animates (engages, enlivens, and illuminates) some aspect of cultural life. The range is surprising and includes animations of Cajun dancing, breastfeeding, adolescence, nation, home, poet Breyten Breytenbach, love in the classroom, and the place of affect in everyday life.Contributors: Christa Albrecht-Crane, Lawrence Grossberg, Petrus de Kock, Geogory J. Seigworth, Patty Sotirin, Charles J. Stivale, Stephen B. Wiley, J. Macgregor Wise."
3,This is what I hear,"Let me preface this review by stating that I am a longtime and devoted fan of Bluegrass and Alt.Country in general and of these four artists in particular.I have enjoyed the music that have produced throughout their separate careers and each appear on many of my all-time favorite CDs. This is the first CD from Rice, Rice, Hillman & Pedersen that I have purchased and was excited to discover that they were making music together.After listening to this CD 3 or 4 times, I can say that the musicianship displayed here is stellar from beginning to end - full and richly textured.So,it is more than a pity that such vituosity is quite spoiled by vocals (no matter who is singing the lead part)that are, while competent, lacking any sparkle or shine and seem wholly uninspired. I'm afraid that this offering has already found itself on the seldom played shelf."
3,Not as good as it could have been...,"I love Tony Rice and I thought that the combination of Rice, Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen would be awesome. It's not. I was more than a little disappointed at the quality of the material. It just seems bland. Most of Tony's material is brilliant, but there's nothing here that rivals his solo stuff. Chris Hillman's voice, while pleasant, doesn't have the show-stopping quality of great bluegrass singers or rock vocalists. It's adequate, just as the CD is."
5,A Great Road Trip Companion,"I purchased this CD the night before an eleven hour road trip based on my love of Tony Rice's past works. The first eight bars of the first song, ""Doesn't Mean That Much Anymore"", sold me on the entire CD, as Rice plays the intro lead with his very recognizable style of picking. The rest of the tunes on this CD present an eclectic combination of musical genres, from simple country ballads to intricate and pure bluegrass classics. ""One of These Days"", ""Friend of the Devil"" and ""Hearts Overflowing"" are espcially nice. I would highly recommend this album to bluegrass regulars as well as those who are looking for a good ""starter"" CD."
4,Very Cool Remixes,"Here is Geri's second UK Single and her very first solo number one! There's a reason for that, you know?Mi Chico Latino is the latin-flavored track that you can't help but sing along to, and is so catchy, that after awhile, you realize you've even gotten the latin rap part down.The Junior Vasquez Mix is very cool and dancey. The only downside is, it's only the 6-minute version and not the full 9-minute remix. But it is still very cool and danceable. The best mix on the CD.The Charlie Rapino 12"" Mix may well be the worst Geri remix yet. It's very motonous, boring, and it's very poorly edited. Geri should have definitely left this one on the shelves (and perhaps put the 9-minute Jr. Mix, eh?)The CoCo Club Mix is very cool and tropical feeling. It starts off with lusty moans, and Geri's sizzling vocals only intensify this hot remix. Only second best to the Junior mix, but has a totally different feeling all its own."
1,Wrong fitment info,Claim to fit a 97 Accord EX sedan but be careful it doesn't. To late to return for me which is totally my fault.
3,Satisfactory Pad,"I have owned Hawk HPS+ pads on my old Honda Prelude. They dusted and squeaked, but once up to temp they had absurd stopping power. These HPS pads now on a Honda S2000 are nothing like their big brother. I have done 2 autocrosses on these pads, and quite a bit of hard-brake-cooking mountain road drives. The HPS resits brake fade quite well. However compared to the OEM Honda S2000 pad they have lesser overall stopping power, lesser initial bite, and dust significantly more. This is probably due to Honda's aggressive S2000 OEM compound. The pads have never squeaked. When it comes time to replace these I will go back to the HPS+."
4,OK choice for party favors,"Bought these as party favors for my three year old's birthday - they are a larger size can than the ones in the ""party pack"" . I bought two packages and there are colors I wouldn't give out to kids as party favors - white, black and brown - so now we can two cans each of those colors for our use here at home. My son isn't too picky on the colors and they get all mixed up anyway so it is not a big deal. We keep a can in our diaper bag to pull out if he gets restless when we are out to eat or whatever."
4,great toy,this toy moves the imagination and encorages the creative side of the child to a higher level. she loves this and it occupies her time enought to give her mom some quiet time to herself.
3,disappointed with shipping,I ordered this product prior to Christmas and expected it to arrive prior to Christmas - as per the website.I was disappointed that the product arrived four days after Christmas.
5,Really Works!!,"This product really works, but don't except an overnight miracle. You have to be patient with this one, take it regularly for at least 2 months and you will start seeing the benefits. You might have to continue for longer depending on how long you have had the condition. I had almost given up, when I found VeinCare and I am glad I did. So if you think nothing is working for your Hemorrhoids or Varicose Veins, this is the product you would want to try out.I have been taking this for 2 months now and will continue to take it for another month. With herbal medicines you need to continue taking them for a little longer even if you think you are cured."
2,This is NOT the complete works of the Guy de Maupassant,"I have no qualms against the Guy de Maupassant or his stories. In fact, he is one of my favorite writers. The reason I gave this only two stars is because of how misleading the title is. When I see the word complete, I expect it to mean that all of his stories are included. There are only 29 stories in this book. Two of my favorites aren't even included--The Necklace, Bellflower. If you want a book that includes all of his stories, as I did, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,The Complete Works of Guy Maupaussant,"As other reviewers noted before I bought the book. This is clearly not his complete works. Instead, this book is a bad photocopy of the original apparently. It was not type-set printing as is evidenced by only partial letters at end of full sentences. But, if you want to enjoy the author's writings, then it is a good start"
1,dissatisfied,"This is the second time I ordered this book from AMAzon...I see that it has been billed to my account but it was never sent. AMAZON, when contacted by phone or email says ""sorry for the problem"" ... and then blindly finishes with ""I hope you are satisfied with our service"". No I am Not!"
1,Can't be used as a steamer rack,"This rack is misidentified as a ""steamer"" as it is actually merely a cooling rack. The very first time I used it in water it rusted and stained a brand new stainless steel pot I had just purchased for $100. It is cheap pot metal which is not designed to be used with water or with steam. It rusted so fast it seemed almost magical.An important note:The company selling this rack through Amazon on this page at time of posting (MV Trading Co.) does not back up its sales. They simply say ""we never said it was stainless"" as if selling a steamer which can't be used as a steamer is excusable if you don't explicitly claim it won't rust out the very first time you use it. This company is highly unprofessional in my experience and I would recommend avoiding them at all costs.Post note/update- I see that the company no longer describes this item as a ""steamer rack"" in the header, but rather a cooling rack. I'm glad they corrected it as such."
3,An early study of California Fractional Gold Coins,"This book describes 449 varieties of California fractional gold coins primarily from the author's collection. The author focuses on only those coins bearing the denomination dol or dollar. No photos or illustrations of the coins are provided. A brief and completely outdated ""rarity guide"" is included for each variety of coin.The author also describes counterfeit coins from the bogus ""Kroll hoard"" of 1924 prepared from dies that were still being used to produce fakes as of the book's printing in 1970.Although I would have liked to have more varieties and photos included, the book is still a somewhat useful resource for identifying some of the ""period one"" pieces of these interesting coins."
5,Beautiful and Inspiring,"A lovely and nuanced translation of a wonderful allegory, with vivid characters and lively detail. Chaucer fans will enjoy."
1,wooden leg-wooden head,Gordon warner has a wooden leg! and was not! is not! much good as a martial artist. All the Kendo players that I know used to knock him on his butt! in the Dojo. He probably need glasses too! if he reviewed this tape as excellent! Anybody else who thinks that this is Kendo! has definitley got a wooden head! 'It's Kendo Jim! but not as we know it' Apologies to Star Trek.
1,Drawings are cute but the words are SOOO STUPID,"The drawings in the Spot series are really cute but the words and storylines in all of the Spot series is just so inane and pointless. They are the most annoying books to read ever. If you're a parent with half a brain and your child has half a brain you will hate this series. Unlike some annoying books that my children ask for again and again, my kids never ask for these more than once."
2,Tone and dialogue NOT typical of most Spot books,"We're long-time Spot fans in our family of 3 children (2-12); so, I was surprised by the negative tone of the story line and some accompanying illustrations in this one. An angry hippo scowls and grumps at Spot twice (for accidently bumping into her in the water when walking backwards and for mistakenly taking her towel instead of his at the end). With these innocent mistakes, I'd have expected something more along the lines of ""Whoa--careful!"" and/or oops--sorry! instead of the harsh/grabby reactions. The hippo looks a lot like an older Helen or Helen's Mom, making it even more uncharacteristic. If I'd have browsed this in a bookstore, I would not have purchased it. Although the paperback flap book is 2003 release, I see now it was originally published in 1985..so maybe that's why.[Still a Spot/Eric Hill fan...but not one of this book and will more carefully screen others before buying.]"
1,Didn't meet our expectations.,"Typically my family likes Spot but the ""story"" isn't here. There is no continuity. Boring. My 3 year old left the room and didn't even bother lifting all of the flaps. : ("
3,Just Ok,"We have a couple of the Spot books which my toddler daughter likes well enough, however they don't hold her attention particularly. And as the person reading them, I find they don't stand up to repeated readings as well as many of her other books. (I am thinking of the series by Sandra Boynton, which seem to fare better.)"
5,Great Book for Toddlers,"WE love the Spot books, especially the lift the flap one. Toddlers seem to love the hide and seek reading and this book is really cute."
3,"The Guns Of Morgette is unique, but the ending was lacking.","When I started reading this book, I was expecting something different. Dolf Morgette is this larger than life gunfighter and the cover art is full of guys shooting at each other, but by the time I reached the end I was disappointed. I expected a dramatic ending with lots of shooting and excitement, but the author went for a calmer approach, that was lacking for me. This novel is well written and clever, with some good humor and suspense. The characters are well developed and funny at times. I suppose I was expecting too much. Still a worthy read for the unique style it offers."
4,Makita 632007-4 9000 9.6-volt 1.3 Amp Hour NiCad Stick Style Battery,You charge it and it makes the drill go. What else can one ask for!
5,Not at all disappointed ...,"My old batteries gave out quite some time ago through excessive use and improper care (I left them in the heat way too much), so finding the same batteries online for a very reasonable price makes my power tool work again and me happy. This why you get the five stars."
5,Keeps My Trusty Makita Cordless Drill Going!,"Just like the Energizer Rabbit, these wonderful batteries keep my trusty Makita Cordless Drill going and going! My first dual set of Makita batteries lasted over 11 years. I don't like the new cordless power tools they crank out today with the huge batteries that add too much additional weight. These slim stick batteries disappear into the Makita handle and add only a minimum of evenly dispersed weight to the drill. Nice. I prefer to purchase the batteries two at a time. One inside the drill and the other in the charger. Needless to say, I love my Makita Cordless Drill. I hope they keep manufacturing these genuine Makita replacement batteries for many years to come."
5,good productI,"i have tryed come cheaper battery of a dollar or two, the brand battery is so much better."
5,Can't Use,I purchased this item and wasted my money. I can't use it because my drill evidently has gone bad rather than the battery. What a waste! It would have been nice to have understood the possibility of returning the battery if it didn't solve my problem. I guess I can buy a drill if I can find one that uses the same battery.
1,NiMH batts,"I got my Makita drill/flashlite combo with the NiMH batteries because I have had little success with CADs staying charged and if they aren't completely drained when you recharge them they defect out immediately (how do you tell when a battery is 100% drained and not 99.2%?).I have almost the same problem with the Makita NiMH batts -- if I don't charge them all the time (my Makita is for home use) they drain out in a few days, and they lose charge very quickly. I have yet to start a job without having to charge them first. I thought perhaps it was because I left them in the tools but that wasn't it.Makita simply has terrible batteries."
1,makita 9.6v 10 pkg battery pack,"The advertisement stated a 10 pkg,this would seem to mean 10 batteries and I received one makita 632007-4 9.6v boxed battery 10-pack.Melvin Hopper"
4,Third Time is Charm!!!,"I have three Makita 9.6 volt battery packs which keep my two Makita drills ""wheezing away""! I have other drills and battery packs with higher voltage but ""nothing"" and I mean ""nothing"" compares with the Makitas performing similar tasks. Don't know what I'll do when the Makita drill motors exceed their life span and ""you know the rest of the story""...thanks Makita. Needless to say, I would make the same purchase choice again."
4,Rainy Days is an excellent first album from Liquid Fiction,"'Bliss' is a word I use often when trying to describe this album. The songs are, for the most part, upbeat and poppy with some interesting and powerful emotions floating around just under the surface. There are a few ballads on the album: the incredibly beautiful ""Incomplete,"" documenting the unwanted (by both parties) end of a relationship, and ""Material Masquerade,"" a song that must be heard to be believed. Get this album. Get it now."
3,"Outstanding group, not-so-outstanding CD","As is often the case on CDs consisting of previously unreleased tracks, on listening to the CD, you begin to realize why the tracks were not released earlier. Even the liner notes have a kind of apologetic tone to them, saying things to the effect of ""yeah, I know this is a lousy recording, but it's all we had.""Die hard fans (and I consider myself one of them) will want to get this CD simply because it does contain some songs you can't get any other way, but none of the songs on the CD really grabbed me the way ""Isaac's Lament"" or ""Silent Night"" did.I would recommend you buy ""The Inessential Uncle Bonsai"" (ASIN B000003Y0V) if you're looking for a good introduction to Uncle Bonsai."
3,Not to Bad,"This video teaches. My 5 year old and 2 year old watched. They learned from it. The video has basic phonics with the alphabet. Including visual example of writing letters. My problem is the puppet character and the ""class room"" students. My kids seem to like the video. It appears to be from the late nineteen seventies or early nineteen eighties. Thus the quality of video and characters are that time period. A bit drab."
2,skip this one,"this is awful. my kids wouldn't watch it. it has bad lighting, bad audio, bad characters, no editing at all, and it's just a waste. i couldn't even sell it at my garage sale. really, there are lots of great videos out there for phonics (get rock 'n learn phonics or rock 'n learn letter sounds) but this is not one of them. i cant believe it had any good rating so i had to tell you. dont bother! it's awful and boring and i see no value whatsoever. i gave it 2 stars because it had good cover-art and maybe it had value back when it was made."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this video thinking that it would be a fun way to help my child learn to read. He watched some of it a few times and lost interest. They recommend doing one fifteen-minute segment at a time, but they don't focus enough. The imaginary character seems tacked-on, and the little rhymes the teacher leads don't help because she goes to fast for kids to learn them and doesn't use them enough. They also don't really seem to fit with the lessons. I'd recommend skipping this one and moving on to the Leap Frog videos, both my four- and two-year-old love them."
3,Sim City Moves On,Its fun for a while but then becomes rather momotonous. Maybe I just don't have the time to do a total exploration of the game. It is a blast though I truly enjoy it.
1,I've had enough of maxis...,"THis is just pathetic, it's like they put all the uneeded things in, but the things that they failed to put in the previous game they still leave out of this one, more high powered computer, new aged crap. All kinds of silly things like people constructing buildings and weird news reports, but nothing for the dedicated sim city fan, we all know maxis is done when they put some crap out like simcitysocieties... nough said..."
3,Lacked Maxis support,"This could have been a great game if Maxis had supported it after release, but all their resources went to the The Sims series instead. The game has bugs and not a single patch was ever released. Once you get fully involved with the game and have a good grasp of how everything works you will realize how predictable the game is and immediately loses replay value. Some elements of the game simply do not work as expected. The game is beautiful but the AI is lacking and I end up micromanaging everything down to the weather. I felt I was playing with myself. There is no surprise; every move I make I already know the outcome ahead of time. Avoid this game if you are familiar with the series as it offers nothing new aside from improved graphics."
5,Not only for fans of this series,"I bought this game for 14 bucks and it is worth at least 5 times that price. If I simply take the time I spend with this game it might be the best value ever for a computer game!Okay, you must love this kind of games. If you more into First-person shooters this game is NOT for you. But if you like micro-management and work for hours on something to make it work (or even a bit more perfect) this is for you.I have to say that I didn't like SC4 when it was released but with the ""Rush hour"" upgrade which is included here it is totally worth its money. It seems like lots of little things were changed to make this game more enjoyable. Now you can take on little missions to earn some additional money if your city is not doing that well ;-)All together a game which keeps you busy for hours! For real Sim City fans who loved SC3000 it is worth a look now. Unfortunately you can't take your old Cities with you :-("
2,Very Disappointing!,"I bought this mostly for my 12 year old son and myself. We both enjoy the tycoon series (roller coaster and zoo) and after reading reviews here I'd thought we'd enjoy Sim City.We had no technical difficulties at all (hence the 2 star overall rating.) The game itself loaded and ran fine. It was frustrating at first because we've never played Sims and were lost. We figured it would be a lot more fun once we educated ourselves with the resources provided. We spent hours pouring through the game tutorials and manual. Even after understanding how everything worked, we found ourselves bored out of our minds. The only person in the family who experienced the slightest bit of joy was my 6 year old. He enjoyed blowing up the buildings.I was expecting the game to be a lot more user friendly, with more fun creative options similar to roller coaster tycoon. Even if you liked any of the tycoons, you won't neccessarily enjoy Sim City."
4,Simulation for hours and hours,"This game has lots of options in order to build a city. It isn't easy though to make it grow as you must keep an eye to the funds available.It is nice to connect different cities and create a metropolitan area. This takes out the restriction for building large cities.The rush hour expansion lets you to explore the city at a ground level. This makes perfect sense as it emphasizes on how the transportation system you build for the city affects the traffic and therefore the well-being of the citizens.This game provides fun for hours and hours as you learn how to balance the sims' satisfaction and the budget.On the system requirements, it is good to know that the game doesn't demand high specs."
3,Sim City 4 worth no more,For the most part I find the game does not hold my interest. It is also rough to manuver to and from different windows and building options
5,The Best Computer Game Ever,"I am completely addicted to Sim City 4. It is the BEST computer game I have ever played (and I own every Sim game.) BTW, I had no trouble finding my code.PS-Does anybody know when the next Sim City (five, i assume) is coming out??"
3,not good,i like everying in the game but i hate it when they add monthly cost to buildings thats the problem i always go bankrupt and have to start all over again but other than that i really like it
1,No Product Key,"My game came without the product code required for activation. Apparently this is a well-known problem. I suggest you avoid this game until the problem is fixed, or pruchase it at a retail location where you can open the box to confirm that an activation code is present."
1,Beware - SimCity4 Does Not Run On Some Windows 98 Machines,"I bought SimCity 4 only to find out that it does not run on some Windows 98 machines. I have all the hardware requirements, so when it did not run I called tech support. Amazingly enough they told me it just did not run on some Windows 98 machines. What a surprise. I normally trust EAGames but this was disappointing."
5,hours of fun,"This game is so addicting and fun, the best thing to do is naming streets and roads and naming neighborhoods and districts. You can make a poor and rich side of town, depending on what area you pay most attention to. The poor side has bad schools and crack houses and the rich side has excellent schools and mansions and snobby people. just a fun and addicting game"
3,"Good, but slightly problematic","I had the same problem as another reviewer: from time to time the game just cuts out, no saving, not even an error message, and my computer is less than 8 months old! It is definitely a glitch in the game. Highly annoying if you've been working on a city for hours.But, if you just remember to save frequently, it's a very fun game. More realistic looking than the previous versions, and the traffic expansion is very detailed. The rewards aren't quite as fun as in 2000 and 3000, but there are new ones.For the price, it is certainly worth a shot."
4,Great Game,This is an excellent game. People who love this type of game will be impressed great graphics really a step up from the years past. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in playingt this style of game.
4,fun and frustrating,"This game really stands up to the expectations I had for it. I LOVE that you can now create multiple cities that can interact with one another by making ""neighbor deals"".I find the game quite frustrating when playing without using any cheats, but that's not a fault of the game, just that I haven't worked out the best city planning strategies yet."
3,"Pretty good game, but unreliable","This is a very great game in all, but it crashes WAY to much. I've played this game for 2 years and it's allways been this way. I'm the type of person who downloads add-ons to the game, and if you add to many, your computer crashes in,like, 10 minutes. My friend, who has a very powerful computer,by the way, has the same game, and it randomley crashes, and in some cases, you may not be able to play the city ever again. All in all, however, it has very good graphics, excellent U Drive It Missions, a wide range of networks, buildings, landforms, and traffic. It is a very good game if you have a pretty good computer, you don't download too many things, it is a amazing game game. :)(P.S. The only reason I gave it three stars, is because it crashes too much, otherwise I would have given it five stars.)"
3,sims 4 Deluxe Edition,Great game fun to play with and has lots of new staff and it has quite the challenge.
1,Not Great...,It wasn't what I expected. I thought I could be the SIM and not just look down on the city. Shouldve known since so cheap...smh
3,sim city 4 could do better,sim city 4 was a sierousley bad game no senarieos whats up whit that. also the sims keep complainaing their like;;kids have laptops teachers drive luxry suv s;; id think theyed be glad about good education. i would consieder it a un luckey break form the under funded school systme of mnps. 2006
1,This thing sucked,i didnt know what it was that made this game suc kit was used and hard t odownload into my comp and it just plian old sucked.
4,"Great game, runs fine on Windows 7","I purchased the download version of the game. It installed and runs fine on Windows 7 x64 (Home Premium). Just a note, I did not install it in the standard Program Files (x86) directory. I've found older games have problems being installed in the protected Windows directories. I installed it in a directory I created, and did not need to change to XP compatibility or run as administrator.About the game itself, it's SimCity. That pretty much sums it up, if you've played the older titles then this one will not surprise you. If you haven't played any of the previous games and like management type sims, I think you will like this game."
3,A great game but very unstable,"Sim City is a great concept and has long been an addictive, intelligent and educational game. There are many variables in place to make sure that you'll have many bankrupt cities until finding the golden formula.The biggest problem though is that it crashes all the time. Every 30-60 minutes of game play, the program will freeze up and crash. This means you have to save constantly which isn't easy to remember when playing a game.I think we're long overdue for Sim City 5!"
3,Still going strong,I've bought and lost numerous copies of this game. What can I say its a classic. if you loved the older one's you'll love this!
5,Awesome game for the price,"This is a great game from Maxis for the price it is selling at now. What makes it so great is not the product itself, but the amount of support that is available in the form of mods and new buildings, etc. made by designers from all around the world.This one is a definite 5. Looking for a good fun game to spend your time? Then pick this one."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,waste of money im sorry i bought this item. i wouldnt recommend this game. its boring and dull and i uninstalled it after a few weeks.
1,doesnt work very well,"The game was fun for a bit, but then it started having lots of glitches and would freeze all the time. I would ask Amazon for my money back if that were possible, but I don't know how. The game won't even open anymore and Amazon won't let me try re-downloading it without paying again, which I'm obviously not going to do."
2,A Word of Caution,"The game itself is fun but aword of caution -- this game comes from the era where security was that you had to have to have the CD mounted for it to play -- if you try and use it on two computers in the same house, the CD always seems to be ""on the other computer""."
3,It can help you kill time,"They say it's realistic but there are a bunch of things that just seem a little too unrealistic.Here are a few of things that would need to be a little more realistic:1. Power/water. A real city doesn't pay to supply power or water to the residents, the residents do.2. Airport/seaport/train/subway. The city doesn't pay for this upkeep either without collecting taxes and tolls that should overshadow the costs. These things pull a profit in real cities, they are NOT a burden to the cities coffers.3. Schools. School taxes pay for building shcools and their upkeep, not the mayor.I find it hard to turn any kind of profit while supplying all of the sims needs that should be provided for through taxes or by a separate entity. This game wore out it's welcome after the first couple of days. I'm currently waiting for a more realistic city building sim. Can anybody recommend one?"
1,Don't Bother Buying - It Won't Work,Saw so many people having problems with the download here I ordered the physical CD to install with.Well when I try installing it asks for the registration code on the back of the game manual....which I entered. And it claims it's an invalid code and won't let me even install it.
1,Not As Good As Expected,"The game is not as good as I thought it would be. It is very slow, and does not run very well..."
2,Too many problems,"This game is too challenging. I bought Sim City 2000 and enjoyed it fairly well, even though it too was too difficult. This game is worse than Sim City 2000 because the land is far too small. The night and day stuff isn't all that great. Also, though the game did work on my computer, I hear it doesn't work on many machines. Plus, despite quite unspectacular graphics, the game will eat up space on your computer! There are many better games out there, and for the price and risk, this one's not worth it."
1,Possibly the worst game ever,"If you want a game that won't load properly, shuts down and freezes up spontaneously, and has no technical support to speak of, then Simcity 4: Deluxe Edition is the game for you! Even the online troubleshooting website is arranged in such a chaotic way and is so poorly maintained that the update download website, apparently fraught with errors, refuses to load. Save your money! Don't buy this game!"
1,The Download does not install!,"I have a new computer that fit the specifications for this game, but after it finishes downloading it does not install properly."
4,Addicting,I have always loved the SIMS games and for $16 I had to download this. I have to say that I have wasted many hours of my life building and destroying cities because this game is addicting. Game play is almost as simple as it used to be with the orginal Sim City but there are lots of new features that help so you don't get bored of playing.
3,Not as good as I remember,Downloaded Sim City 4 to make the time go by until the new Sim City comes out this February. This game is pretty buggy and doesn't really run all that well on Windows 7. For $10 - well it's okay. Nothing to brag about and not as good as I remember.
4,Find out why your taxes are what they are,"The over-all game play experience is great. There are a few changes that could be made to make it more play-able. Such as, how about an elevated avenue crossing for inter-sataes and rail lines. A move-able camera view to see the stuff behind other graphics. More than one city in a LARGE zone would be cool too. A ""ghost"" rendering of adjacent zones would be nice too, to allow accurate matching of rail and hi ways.Alot of people think that the inter-face isn't right. It isn't ""intuitive"" enough. Heck, most of the fun is figuring out how to do something.After playing the game for two days straight, I came away with a new and thorough understanding of just how difficult it is to manage a city effectively. It even changed some of my feelings toward the mayor of my real life home city."
2,Way too complicated,"I have been a fan of this series since the original SimCity for the MAC. Unfortunately, I think they have finally taken the simulation too far in terms of complexity. The beauty of the game used to be that you could jump right in and build cities and learn as you go. Some cities flourished shile others failed. But it was fairly easy to learn from your mistakes and improve your ability to build successful cities. The new simulation is so confusing that you have to complete all the tutorials to even have a basic understanding of where to start. I don't want to be a real mayor and I'm not creating a real city so I liked this game much better when it was a little more simplistic."
5,Classic,The game is still addicting after all these years. the download is fast and easy and the fact that you can use the same download on different computers is very convenient.
2,A bit Disappointing,"This new version is obviously breathtaking graphics wise, but disapointing when I wanted to run Famous cities like London."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVED IT!!!It was so cool you can DRIVE (yes you Read Right)-DRIVE Cars orBoats or Trains or Plains WOW!There is a Regen Mode wicht is usfull.You can terraform (Make Mountons & Stuff)Give the city your own name (Naturly)and SOOOO much moreOH! and for every city you get nifty set of advicers!Thats what I have to say By!
4,<<NICE>>,"This game was worth it, i know i just bought it and its been out for a while but it still is fun to play. i mean ive unlocked how to build a city so now i think im ganna work a real one now in my back yard... na im kidding but for real its a good game, so if you like a game that never ends this is the one you want."
1,disappointed,"its been 3 months since I purchase this game and haven't been able to play, keep getting an error, and EA customer service is no help and they don't reply to my emails.customer service is not in EA dictionary."
1,Game never worked properly.,While playing Sim City the game constantly shuts down in the middle of playing a game. The game is slow even though the computer is new. Opening the game is not an easy process. I don't think I would purchase a game through amazon in this fashion again.
3,"Yep, its SimCity","Okay so I hadn't play SimCity in a while before buying this game, and surprisingly it is exactly the same game I played when I was ten (that was eleven years ago). Besides bringing up memories which were pleasurable, this game was not that entertaining but mildly addictive until I built everything I could possibly build in two days. While it was difficult to maintain a city when I was ten, this time around I was given buildings from the happy citizens, and had completely run out of space to build and my city budget was still in the black. I tried to play rush hour but found that to be very irritating and stupid. The missions and controls were horrible. So if you enjoy a challenge and have never played any version of SimCity, this game is for you. But for me, until they make a new ground-breaking city simulator, I'll hold on to my money."
4,Cities are fun (sort of),"This game is great but some previous experience with the other sim city games is recomended although, you don't have to. There is a training program in it but if you wanna jump right in then you might want to be familiar with the buttons. Also it is very easy to go into bankruptcy."
3,Mildly buggy but still fun,This is about a week long into ownership of this game. I have frequent crashes to desktop so I have learned to save progress often. The game is immersive and I really enjoy it. It's not so hard to learn and it is very rewarding to play. Therapeutic in some ways. I am happy I bought it.
4,"Works on Vista, keeps me up nights, lots of fun..hard to beat.","I got this for myself this Christmas :) It does work on Vista unlike another reviewer said. My husband's laptop pc has only Vista and it played fine. It did crash once, however...just shut down. I have since then saved it over and over. Why though, I ask myself as I keep losing lol I can't figure out this game, my finances tank and there are riots in the streets...I can't beat it! Hours and hours of fun."
4,life was so much simpler when we were kids,"I bought this based on the countless hours of time I spent on prior versions of SimCity over the years. I hadn't played the last few iterations, but the prior products had a good enough place in my mind to warrant this purchase. Man, the game sure grew a lot more complex!The complexity is both an asset and a hinderance. I especially liked the multiple city aspect, which was a nice layer of added complexity. However, there is just so much detail in the options of teh rest of the game that it is overwhelming at times."
3,Cool game,I heard about Sim City 5 coming out and couldn't wait for the release so O went for SC4. I was originally a player of the original Sim City for the Mac OS back in 1995. I was surprised by all of the new variables and controls in the newer version and then when I got a little more advanced with the city there were too many cursors on the screen at once and my computer started running slow. That made the game somewhat hard to enjoy although I keep on playing. I will not be getting the new SC5 because my computer does not run fast enough.
4,More of the same...reliable fun with few new surprises,"If you are looking for something brand new from this edition, you may be disappointed. The game play is still enjoyable and fun. If you like what they've put out before, then you'll probably like what this game has to offer. If you are looking for a substantial departure from their previous games, you'll likely be disappointed."
3,Great game but crashes every so often,"I've been a fan of the Sim City series since I played the SNES port of the original game many years ago. The 4th release of the series is everything i expected it to be and then some more, but sadly, the game crashes on a rather regular basis, no warnings, no error messages, nothing. You go from looking at the game to your desktop in a couple of seconds and for no apparent reason, making the whole experience annoying at best and infuriating at worse (ever had your city growing nicely to suddenly lost your last hour without even a warning?)Even if I'd love to give the game 5 stars, it saddens me that Maxis or EA or whoever was responsible, decided to release the game in such a buggy condition.Still, if somehow you manage to run the game without a glitch, I wholeheartedly recommend it."
4,My Mistake,I wrote a bad review witch is not true the dealer called me and helped me to get the key I needed to run the game it was found by looking at the game books and the game works great if not for the call of the seller It would not be working but they did a great job in finding the key and helping me on my way good Job Seller its nice to know there are still honest companys out there that care and will help when needed thank you very much for your help. This kind of help will keep customers comming back and thank you again.
3,"chalanging game, will over heat computer.","this is a fun game to think through, but it is difficult to turn a profit. overall it is very fun to play and I would recommended it.Update:After playing it for a few months I noticed a nasty habit of this program, it takes the CPU up to 100% and pegs it there. After about 30 min of game time I have to save and exit to let the computer cool off or the game will hang or crash the system. I installed all the patches I could find but there is still a bug in the game. It did this on two computers well in excess of system requirements.Until the CPU bug is fixed I cannot play it long enough to be fun."
5,Best SimCity yet,"I have had this game for 3 years now and it's still enjoyable, playable, and challenging. For the price that is runs for now, people shouldn't think it any less of a game simply because it's not the orginal $50, or the $50 that new games run.I have had a few issues, it has sometimes stopped for no reason and disappeared from my screen. I have now learned to use the save function.Other than that, it's a great game."
4,You are in control - Sim City 4 Deluxe,"This can keep you busy for hours! You decide where and who can live in your city, what kind of city it will be and everything about it!"
4,My son really enjoys it.,An easy game and hours of fun. Kids learn skills such as planning and reasoning.
2,Not as good as sim city 3000,Not as good as sim city 3000 very few maps to play to start out to learn the game and if you start a map it is very hard to keep your city going.
4,great but time consuming,"this game is time consuming like so many others. but it is a great mind stimulator, and completely clean"
2,SimCity4,"This game was pretty cheap! But the only thing is that the game it self , is pretty boring. So I dont really play it. But its cool the digital download!!"
2,EA should have quit while ahead.,"I purchased this game when it was new, and my computer while meeting the requirements just couldn't run it. I put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again. The computer I have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings. Yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work. I contacted tech support and got what I am now sure are just something for me to try until I quit trying and leave them alone. It worked. They win. They got my money and I got jack."
5,10 Fingers Up!,Great game. Good graphics. 1000x easier to get $. Much better than any other Sim game.
3,A little disappointed,I really did prefer simcity 3 to this version. The new one just is more complicated and the graphics are about the same as version 3. I would just stick to simcity 3 if i was you.
1,Game won't work,"I loved earlier Sim City's, so this one looked like the end all be all. I tried installing it on 2 totally different systems, and it will not work on either system. One system is a Toshiba laptop, Satellite 2455-S305, which i bought i FEB03. The other system is a home built, Intel P4 running XP Pro. I went to Simcity's website and there are no patches available yet. This game could not have been tested AT ALL before they decided to market it... i thought only microsoft sent things out the door only half baked???"
2,NAhhh,Well I was really excited when I bought this game cuz I always wanted to drive stuff and be the mayor and stuff but after a while it got really boaring so then i play it like a week or two and then it just got boring cuz u had to manage everything I do not like this game you should spend 30 bucks on this game spend it on the original one abd the expansion packs like the unleahed and vacation there really cool.If u buy u r just wating ur money.
2,Not that good ( at all ),"First of all i do not recommend buying this game. It is a little pricy and its not very good. It is IMPOSSIBLE to get even 10,000 people in your city!! Its so hard! Also it does not have any of the good things like in Sim City 3000. ( look at the chartFinally I DO NOT recommend that you buy this game.Buy Sim City 3000!!actully i can't tell you what to do so i guess this has changed your mind on wasting 40$ and alot of frustration. I HATE THIS GAME. I hope they make a Sim City 5 that would be so cool! Hahaha you could like insert yourself into the city. that would be so awsome. So rember sont buy this game dont make the mistake i made. oh ya and this is my opnion so some people might like it. ( i dought it ) hahahaas you can see sim city 3000 is sooooo much better. and i final farwell. Remember Dont buy Sim City 4 buy Sim City 3000"
4,This is a fun classic game.,"This is a fun classic game. I played all of the previous Sim City games, but somehow I missed this one. I finally purchased it this year as something to do in my spare time on my laptop, and I really enjoy it."
5,Stunning Experience!,"I am a long time owner of the original SimCity. The new game is absolutely light years away from the original.Not only is the AI much more advanced in SimCity4, but the functionality and graphics are tremendous. There is simply nothing as fulfilling after finally getting the city budget into the black than entering the sims screen and driving a police cruiser around the city running cars off the street. ;)Also, The night time mode is absolutely beautiful, and I find myself exposing my sims to an eternal nocturnal environment. :)The gameplay and superb graphics do come at a price. The memory and disk space needed to run the game are intensive for most computers that don't have the latest generation processing speeds, video cards and memory. The game worked seamlessly over Christmas on my parents laptop, but was sluggish on my computer which barely meets the minimum requirements. Much to my distress, the game will be shelved until I can purchase a newer system."
5,missing code found,"Like other reviewers, I was disappointed when I couldn't find the 20 character/digit code that was required to install the game. It wasn't on the CD box which was where the installation program told me to look for it. I searched through all the written material that came with the program and finally found the code on the back of the SimCity 4 manual at the top of the page. If other owners are having trouble finding the code, check the manual.We've only been playing this game for about an hour, but the sound and graphics are great and it seems fairly straight forward as far as building and running the city."
5,wonderful book,I would recommend this book to anyone who needs more calm and peace in their life. this book certainly has helped me. it is helpful with a little humor mixed in.
2,Disappointed,"The audio tape contains useful information; however, I was disappointed that Joyce Meyers was not the actual speaker. I have listened to other audio cds of hers and found them to be not only useful but entertaining as well. I found my mind wandering often as I listened to Pat Lentz speak on the CDs."
2,Dissapointed,"I had hoped to give this audio book as a gift. Now I am praying about who to give it to that will appreciate it. The reading by Pat Lentz lacks the life, impact and zest that flows from Joyce herself. I am dissapointented and wish I had not purchased this CD."
4,A book to not overlook,"Joyce Meyer really focused on an area where we all need to work. How many times could anyone one of us, made a smarter choice in how we would interact with another? Joyce teaches us in this one, that we all need to be more aware of what we do, say, and even think, of our fellow man(or woman). A lot of wisdom in this one. Good work Joyce."
5,Adorable Plush Pig,I bought this stuffed animal for my daughter and she absolutely adores it! It's very big and VERY huggable!
5,Conversation with Koko,"This is the most amazing animal story have ever made. The fact that we can communicate with another species is magical. Koko tells us that Gorillas can feel pain and love and grief. Gorillas actually communicate with each other in sign language, that's why this was so easy for Koko. If we could only communicate with every species like this, we might realize that ALL species have a right to live on this earth in freedom and happiness, not just the human race. Michael, Koko's gorilla companion, actually remembers his mother being murdered in the jungle. Join the Gorilla Foundation and help save the Gorillas! Everyone should see this film."
4,Great Advent Calendar,"I gave this as a gift to my son and another one for his friend's birthday. They can't wait to open one every morning during the advent season. Lego did a great job. However, my son did wish there were less people and more ""building"" projects."
5,Lifeboat Navigation,"As a life-long mariner with a keen interest in navigation, I can say that the material coverage in the book is legitimate and, as a novice, I would need to read about it. I purchased the book for a retired Navy Captain who is an expert in nuclear technology but has not used his Navy skills in navigating. His recent purchase and overhaul of an ocean-going sail boat had me worried. So I am introducing him to survival books, of which this one might be most valuable. I also gave him Chapman's Against The Sea to learn about how things can go wrong very quickly and if you are not prepared in mental and material ways you can perish."
5,Good,"a bit technical, but navigation is a technical subject. No way around that except to use a GPS and let the electronics do all your thinking and navigating for you."
4,A book that must be practiced.,"Ok here's the situation, you are in the middle of the atlantic on your sailing boat, a huge wave has just broached you, but the yacht is OK, nothing seriously damaged. However, the electronic navigation equipment is suffering from it's salt water bath and when you dust the cobwebs off your sextant your trusty crewman drops it over the side. You have your almanac, but you can't find a hand compass anywhere. A fog is beginning to come down and you are afraid that you might be drifting into a busy shipping lane. What to do?Well, if you had read this book, and if you were diligent enough to practice the techniques regularly you would still have some fingernails left and instead of spending the night sounding off your foghorn at three minute intervals you could have been sleeping comfortably below in the knowledge that the sextant dropper owed you a night watch."
1,Too hot,This product should contain live bacteria. It was shipped from Florida to Arizona and arrived so hot that you could barely touch the bottle. I have used it before and it did NOT work as it should. I believe all the bacteria were killed in the heat. I wrote to the producer and explained and the reply said that it should be fine. I will not buy from this producer again.
4,Billie and Lester together at last,"Someone has picked through the 10 Columbia Quintessential Billie H. recordings and extracted all the songs where Lester Young's tenors sax slithered around Billie's lines. And these were always my favorites anyway. Billie called Lester ""Prez"" - President of Saxophone - because she loved his playing.This is a different Billie than the Billie on the 50's Verve recordings. Even when she sings a sad ballad, she seems sassy, chipper and somewhat upbeat. A twinkle in the eye. These are classic performances.The recording, well, what can you expect from the 30's? Probably mastered on shellac 78 records, not tape. Adds to the charm. This is about as good a transfer as you can get from this source.Good price.Of the two in this series, vol 1 has the better songs, I think, but this is worth having also."
3,For the ladies,I've done yoga workouts in the past. This one is definitely targeted towards the women crowd. Some of the exercises are a bit awkward for men to do. Not a big fan of this DVD. The matrix function is good though because you can pick which parts of the workout you want to do.
2,Creepy,"I was so excited by all the great reviews of this item, but when I actually got it and watched it, yikes. I found the woman creepy and weird. Why do her shorts have to be so short? There were times I thought I was watching a sesame street porno. I don't have much experience with Kundalini yoga, but this video makes me think it's not for me. I prefer the smooth flowing yoga styles typical of Rodney Yee. Well, now I know..."
5,Life Changing Yoga Workout!,"I am not normally a fan of yoga but raviana has got me hooked! The yoga is different than a lot of other DVDs I've done and because of that, I am never bored with it. I now have a few of their programs and Transformer is a favorite. No matter how down I feel, I am up when I am finished! Over time it feels like this workout is actually changing my cells and brain matter. LOL, but it's true! What I like is the way they don't talk for hours before you are actually doing anything. You get right to moving and you do move! I actually sweated doing this. It starts with standing horse stance arm moves. It also has some ab work and all the other workout must haves. Overall this feels very cardio like their other workouts. Like I said, this isn't like the traditional yoga where you are holding poses. You are moving and breathing. Ravi & Ana bring such warm and fun energy to their DVDs that you want to do the workouts over and over again."
4,Great value for the price,I was looking for a replacement for an aging Dell server used purely for file sharing. I was interested in a RAID solution but couldn't justify the price. This + a scheduled nightly backup to a large hard drive in my PC works very well.My only gripe would be that the user-interface for the device is not intuitive. This seems to be all too common for these kinds of devices. The good news is you don't need to use it for much once the device is setup.
4,Has worked flawlessly for 6 months now,"I purchased this drive over 6 months ago, and use it for backups for my home network. The drive has been very reliable with no issues to date, and is very fast, although gigabit ethernet support would have been nice at this price. The backup software it comes with works, but you'd be much better off with another backup tool to use with this drive. I use Windows XP backup and it works just fine for me.Update 3/31/2008: This drive is still on my home network and going strong. No issues whatsoever after all this time. That pretty much says it all.UPDATE: Feb 2012 - this thing is still working after literally being on 24x7 for 5.5 years. Unbelievable."
1,Questionable Mac support,"I bought the H01R300 based on it being compatible with Mac OSX v10.2.8 and higher. But the box arrived and had no mention of Mac compatibility and only a windows compatible installation CD. I'm now in the process of downloading install images and firmware update packages from the Maxtor website. So, it appears Mac compatibility is sort of a do it yourself option. I have not completed the process yet so I'm hoping the product is as good as the rest of these reviews suggest. So, if you are looking for Mac compatibility, I'd suggest not buying the product on line. Find the product in a store and verify the package includes the Mac in the system requirements list."
2,I want to like this product but.,"I bought this drive and had problems initially getting it to show up on my network. Customer suppport is 9-5 so I was unable to get help as I do these things in the wee hours of the morning when the kids are gone to bed. Once I got the drive online I had all kinds of security /rights issues. Finally I called the tech support. The lady I spoke with was very rude, not sure why... she directed me to download firmware I did problems still existed. Then she tell me to ensure that none of my ""root"" folder on the drive has any special characters.. i.e ""_"" or "" "" spaces or ""'"" punctuation marks. I was about to adjust except.. the one folder I had that was actuall working had this information. The public folder that comes default with the device had spaces and I could accees some and not he other.I WOULD NOT Recomend thsi product ot anyone with a few strands of hair left, to buy this product."
5,Perfect!,"I've never written a review, but I rely on them when making purchases. My experience with this product moved me to write.It was exactly what it was advertised to be. Once the package was open, I had it in my equipment closet, attached to my wireless router and powered up in about 2 minutes. I spent the next 30 minutes loading the software on my home computers (3 desktops and 2 laptops). I spent the next few days setting up the central storage area for the whole family to use, including a storage scheme for our music and photos, and moving files. Once I had all our photos and music stored centrally, I deleted them from the workstations. I then setup automatic backup on each machine. Then, I turned on the streaming capability and started listening to music through my living room stereo.This was one of the most pleasant technology buying experiences I've ever had. It's perfect. Well done, Maxtor!"
1,Do not bother - mine does not work,"I received this drive a week ago. I set it up and followed the instructions. It does not work. It does not show up under my network or any place else.I reported the problem to Maxtor and after trying a few simple steps, they marked my issue as resolved, when in fact it is not.DO NOT BOTHER WITH BUYING THIS ONE."
2,"Disappointing, a lost opportunity",I was expecting a great deal more from somebody who is presumably in the thick of the entertainment industry. This book is a magazine article stretched to 300 pages. It contains very little insight and few compelling anecdotes.
2,Should be 300 lines instead of 300 pages,The same information could have been given more succintly and effectively in 300 lines.
2,BIG SIZZLE...little steak,"What did G.W. Bush say about the Clinton Administration...""so much promise to no great purpose."" Well, that about covers this book. Surely, the ""leading consultant to the world's top entertainment companies"" could have gotten clearance for some actual case studies (change the names to protect the innocent?) Instead, Wolf scribes the equivalent of the old consultantcy practice of borrowing your watch to tell you the time...however, the hologram jacket-cover does look good on a bookshelf.*note* above political quotes reflect neither support nor disdain for any political party or person."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"With its slick cover and engaging title, I was eager to read this book. This book, however, was a HUGE disappointment, as the author did not share much in-depth knowledge about the industry that would be fascinating to outsiders. I honestly felt like if I read a few issues of Variety I could have gained more insight of the entertainment world."
4,An excellent introduction to the entertainment industry,"The Entertainment Economy is a very entertaining book, taking the reader through a review of the exciting and rapidly growing world of Entertainment. Wolf provides vivid and colorful accounts of the developments propelling the world economies into the Age of Entertainment. This book just might remind a few people to engineer enjoyment into experiences, and not just efficiency. In any case, a must-read for anyone interested in entertainment."
5,Be More Entertaining and You'll Get the Business,"This fascinating, easy-to-read book is built around a simple and compelling message, entertainment is a key differentiating element in making business services and products more successful. Everything is becoming more experience than product or service. The Entertainment Economy reminds me of a great story from The 2,000 Percent Solution. Coca-Cola tried to replace its original product with an improved taste formula, but consumers did not associate their happy memories with the taste of the new, improved product and rebelled. Classic Coca-Cola was back soon. Experience was more important than optimal taste. I also think you will enjoy working in your business better after you add an entertainment element, so will your employees, and your suppliers. Pretty soon, you'll be having a ball. You will also have a ball when you read this brightly-written book. I recommend that you read In Pursuit of Prime, also."
5,A really informative fun book.,"Michael Wolf has written a terrific inside look into how entertainment businesses are run and how The Entertainment Economy is affecting every part of our everyday lives. At first I thought it would be another one of those boring business books, but Wolf has a great humourous writing style coupled with fabulous insight and the wild thing is I couldn't put it down."
4,Easy reading and informative,"An informative, easy to read overview of the past, present and future of entertainment and it's economic effects."
2,The Ego Has Landed,"This book would have made a great magazine article.Unfortunately, Wolf quickly establishes his premise (that entertainment is becoming an increasingly important force in all aspects of the global economy), and beats it bloody by about page 90. Thereafter, the book degenerates into a discussion of (a) how great his clients and potential clients are (Bob Pittman and Judy McGrath return the favor, by providing the blurbs shown on the cover of the book), and (b) how brilliant his analysis has been, from the time he was in college until today, cannily guiding media moguls down the correct and enlightened path.This book, in short, continues the trend started by ""In Search of Excellence"" and ""Reengineering the Corporation"": Books by consultants who have somehow gotten us to shell out $20-25 for a hardcover version of their consulting firm's promotional brochure."
2,"After a fast start, Wolf runs out of fuel.","As a $480 billion industry, entertainment represents about 7 percent of our economy. This makes it a worthy topic for analysis. Wolf gets off to a good start in the early chapters, telling us how entertainment became so pervasive a component of our work and education, as well as our leisure. We see the sociological and technical reasons. We are informed about the vast increase in entertainment media of all types, and how this competes for our attention. This is why only the best gets noticed; why so few books, music albums, movies, television shows, and web sites make money.After the fourth chapter, though, Wolf lapses into a retelling of the obvious. Chapter 5 offers a few interesting tidbits on the lives and work of a few media moguls, but anyone who keeps up with business and technology news from the popular press will learn little from the rest of the book."
2,Lightweight book on a lightweight subject,"A breezy compendium of examples and hastily drawn conclusions, like you could get by reading columns in Fortune or Fast Company for several months straight. Filled with gems such as (this is paraphrase) ""Tommy Hilfiger figured out that the way to reach young America was to have products associated with coolness"". You keep thinking, well duh. Wolf must be a heck of a schmoozer."
1,"Entertaining, perhaps, infromative - no","I really wanted this book to have definitive, hard hitting infromation on the real impact of entertainment on the economy, business models and culture. Unfortunately, the only message was we are spending more time and money then ever before on entertainment. It shouldn't have taken 300 pages to repeat this message."
1,3 strikes - NWR04B is OUT!,"After replacing 2 of these under warranty, the 3rd unit needs to be unplugged and reset every few hours. Not reliable hardware."
1,Seemed like a great deal - until the hardware failed,"I was excited to get this product, especially with the rebate. It installed easily, and worked, for about 12 hours. I called tech support and we determined my router was dead. The router could not be accessed using the web interface. It was very hard to get an RMA because these are new, and they are not set up for returns. It took more than 6 phone calls.My replacementunit worked well, (the hardwired links only, the wireless had issues, even with a wireless cardbus card by the same manufacturer)The new router died the same way the next morning. It was on a surge supressor, and everything was OK using an older non-wireless router. (I also have a NR041B)I wish I could return the router and the wireless card, but because I sent in the UPC for the rebates, I'm stuck, and will have to buy products from another company."
2,Somewhat Flakey,"My Network Anywhere Wireless Cable/DSL Router was a good bargain at Radio Shack, and I would be happy, I think, if I was just browsing the web, but I have to get into my home network from outside and the router makes this difficult for these reasons:*It doesn't seem to renew the DHCP lease at my ISP. After 4 days I have to renew it by hand.*If the lease expires while I am away, the home network becomes unreachable.*If I stay off line long enough, the ISP gives my IP address to someone else and I get a different one. Then I get to do lots of DNS work so my mail server is visible*This is a painOther than this, I like it OK. It worries me how hot it gets, but that may just be the way it is.Alan"
1,Don't flash it...,"Like a lot of others i saw this for $20 at Staples. Cheap for a wireless router and if it's crap, well i'm only out $20. Well, i guess i'm out $20. Played with it for a little while and it seemed fine, but like every other tweaker i thought i'd upgrade the firmware before finalizing it's usage. Bad idea. Flash said it was successful but afterwards the diagnostics light came on and stayed on. No more DHCP, no more browser connectivity, no IP on the router, no router (I think the switch aspect may still be OK).Bottom line, for $20 i would have been happy with even poor wireless functionality, but no functionality is no good. If you buy one, don't flash it.Now where's that damn receipt....."
3,Disappointed,"Like others, I bought this router because it's cheap. I've had it for several months.Unlike others, I have met mostly with success using this router. It's been routing http, ftp, rdp, and other traffic into my home network. Outbound connections just plain work. I found the router easy to set up and wireless connections started right up. WEP works. Inbound port forwarding works. For the most part I'm happy with this router.But every few weeks, this router will simply stop routing traffic between my internal and external networks and I don't know why. It may be that it doesn't renew its DHCP lease properly; I don't know. I called technical support and was just flabbergasted by the incompetence there.Currently I must reboot my router every few weeks. It's very frustrating. I would recommend against this product overall. Spend a few more dollars and get something reliable."
1,Tin cans and string would be better...,What can I say? It does not work reliably for any period of time. Crashes occur regularly and require constant resetting. Don't waste your time (or money) unless a newer Firmware is released that corrects the problem.
1,Tin cans and string...,"Got this unit with a matching PCMCIA card. Out of the box it set up easily enough...untill you actually try to use it. Much like the other reviewers I have had untold problems with stability while connected to a high speed cable modem. Both wired and wireless cannections drop out regularly. At times it will remain functional for days, and at others it will crash and require resetting every few minutes. I can't find any external sources for the problems and have it connected to a UPS to prevent power from being an issue. Don't try to save the few dollars, get a real Linksys WiFi router. This one has, it seems, inherant problems and has not had a firmware update since June 2002. I am sure a better supported firmware would fix this product...but why bother untill then?"
2,good for shoes/sneakers only,"Nice quality material however do not purchase if you intend on wearing work boots as you will never get them on or off, even if you go 3-4 sizes too large"
5,Best hardcore in the industry.,"Whoever says that Christian music isn't hard and that it's all lovey dovey P+W (which is ok), listen to this CD."
5,...brutal...intense...it's insanity at it's best...,"this is quite possibly one of the best hardcore albums ever. it continues in the direction of 'where blood and fire...', only more so. the music will leave you huddled in a corner, weeping and fearful yet begging for more. lyrically, daniel has matured more so than on 'where blood and fire...', and his lyrics are powerful and emotional. as i listen, i cannot help but say to myself 'beautiful.' an odd comment for such a brutal hardcore album? perhaps. but beautiful music is beautiful music. bring on the insanity."
4,Black metal collides with hardcore.,"The new Zao CD was rumored to be ""the heaviest thing this side of Scandinavia."" I don't agree. However, this CD is intense! I am most reminded musically of The Splinter. Some songs are different and heavier than ever before but the CD makes me think of Splinter. Vocally Daniel has stepped up with even better vocals than Blood and Fire. The two guitar approach is also better. The best songs in my opinion are tracks 2,3,5, and 10. This album is definitely a winner."
5,"""The scariest album ever created""","This is a scary album! After all it is about hell, the most hideous thing created. If you have not yet saved yourself from hell (Liberate Te Ex Inferis), this album will scare you right into it. It brings about an atmosphere that is absolutely incredible. Very dark and frightning, yet you can actually feel a gleeming light as you listen to it, saying ""there is hope, there is a way out"". I have never heard anything like this. There is not another album out there that can bring about such powerful feelings and emotions to the listener. The music is just short of a miracle."
5,A great introduction to Christian music,"I first heard of Zao in an interview with Dino Cazares from Fear Factory, saying that they were one of his favorite heavy bands. I had never heard of them before, and so I tried to download some songs, but with no luck. I had forgotten about them, to be honest, and then I went in this store that buys out places that are going out of business, and this was the cd that was right on the front of the rack. It was like [amt.], so there was no way I could pass it up. I rushed to my car, pumped it on my speakers. This is one of the coolest, hardest bands around. That's why it totally blew me away when I found out that they're Christian. I went back to the store the next day and bought Where Blood....and Spliter Shards..as well. Every single track on this cd a good one, and the whole feel of the album is very dark. ""Ghost Psalm"" is my favorite track."
3,"It's good, but....","I usually only review the albums i like but I want to review this one.Now the music is O.K.. but I have two complaints about this C.D. 1. Ahhh, the voice way to raw and high piched, and it overpowers the guitar, and could have been mixed better.. 2.Please get don't get mad, but they Are a bit to cryptic, and it seems like the songwriter doesent even understand them. I think the singer just sings stuff he doesent understand and calls it poetery."
2,wow...am i the only one who sees what is wrong,"I will list good before bad in this review.GOOD:hard music...great beats ..guitars are decently clear,nothing real spectactular in the talent area.Songs are played fairly long enough to show bands abilities.BAD:singer sounds like he is from hell...no joke...this is satanic sounding,this is a CHRISTIAN band.I am not saying the memebers are not believers,i know they are,but the vocals are weird and annoying..the only way you can like this music is if you are extremely mad or you are by yourself.I mean if i want to listed to some music in my car and my friends are with me,do i want some lizard boy singing in my speakers..i dont think so....it doesnt even appeal to 99.9% of all people who say they like hard rock music.I own hard core bands like Blindside,TFU,and Selfminded..and they are real hardcore bands,and the humanoid from ZAO makes them sound like they are just talking their songs."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Khan Amore's ""Hypatia"" is, in many ways, a rather tragic book. It represents a stunning failure of the publishing industry. This book gets my vote for the worst book ever published. Superficially, the book may be classified as a sci-fi historical novel. It is an historical novel because it is set, mainly, in fifth century Alexandria and its environs. It is science fiction because it involves time travel. However, the book consists, almost entirely, of a sequence of lengthy and detailed paedophile fantasies. These are interspersed by equally lengthy diatribes bemoaning, in the same tired, old ways, the evils of Christianity and, to a lesser degree, religion in general. Don't waste your time."
1,not as pictured,My house cookie cutter looks nohing like this. i don't know if it got bent while shipping or if it was just the cutter itself but it's nothing like this i couldn't even use it for what it was needed for cause the shape was so off
5,classic cookie cutter,a classic metal cookie cutter with sturdy construction. it arrived well packaged in less than two days. a good product for a great price!
5,inwalls,I use these as part of a 7.1 sound system for the left and right rear speakers they sound very good..clear and good base
2,Disapointing,"I connected these speakers to a Denon 3310-CI Amp hoping I was going to get a good rounded sound for my kitchen to enjoy while cooking.The instructions were clear, installation was easy but one of the two speaker was defective and not producing any bass.The bass was very weak on the other one though even after boosting from the amp. High frequencies were good but mediums were very boring most likely tiring when listening for long period.Maybe I'm used to listen to High fidelity hence the reason for my disappointment but in any case I'm going to look for higher end ones."
5,Mattimeo Review,My daughter LOVES these books!!! Thanks for making it easy for me to get them for her!
4,pretty good book,"Mattimeo is a young mouse, the son of the Redwall warrior to be exact. He is always getting in trouble one way or another with his friends Tim and Tess Churchmice, and Sam Squirrel. His father Matthias is getting very frustrated and puts him to work for punishment. His father is sorry he was harsh with him because that night Mattimeo is stolen from him along with Tim, Tess, Sam, and Cynthia Bankvole, by a band of slavers. Matthias, Basil Stag Hare, Jess Squirrel and some others they meet along the way including a badger, an otter, and a hedgehog. Their journey to find their young ones leads them to the old Loamhedge. They even make the cliffs dance. Read the book to find out what happens."
4,Review of Mattimeo a Tale of redwall,"Mattimeo is a naughty little male mouse who suddenly gets caught by Chickenhound, son of Sela the fox. Chickenhound was terribly injured in the last book, Redwall. He got a knock on his head and became terribly crazy. He thought that the Redwallers were the ones who injured him so he decided to mousenap most of the young mice in Redwall. In the process, Mattimeo became a slave and finally becomes a true warrior"
5,Super!,"I think this is one of the best Redwall books yet. It is very intresting, and very exciting. Please read this book. I'm pretty sure you will love it!"
4,This book is a fantasy/adventure with mice and their friends,"I read Matimeo by Brian Jacques. In this book, Slagar the Fox tricks the Redwallers into letting him in their abbey. He puts the adults to sleep and kidnaps the kids. Mathius the Warrior and a few other Redwallers follow the trail. This book, an adventure/fantasy, is great for boys 10-13. The author, Brian Jacques, has two sons and a dog. He lives in Liverpool and writes in the Summer. One reason why readers like this book is it's full of suspense. A really good scene is when they describe a black, blubbery face. Another reason readers like this book is it has a lot of neat battles."
5,Nearly My Favorite,"Make sure you read this book! It's one of his absolute best and one of my favourites for sure! I Brian is as descriptive as always, employs a wonderful plot, and introduces a few more lovable characters. He's done it again. You must read this!! :)"
5,the kidnapped woodlanders,I liked this book because of its plot. An evil fox kidnappes a bunsh of baby woodlanders. Then one some of the parents go and fight to get them back. After a long fight they win thier children back
4,From brat to warrior and from weakness to honor,"This is a great book for people who love adventures, perils, and good triumphing over evil. In this epic tale, a young mouse goes through the horror of slavery, beatings, death, and seeing his friends and parents being killed or hurt before his eyes. And through it all, he goes from being a spoiled brat, to the guardian and warrior of Redwall. The thrill and shock of this tale is enough t get anyones heart pumping. The battles and traps of Slagar the Cruel and Mathius, Warrior of Redwall Abbey, is breath taking. How everything can be lost with one wrong move or one wrong step. But through it all, Mathius gets his revenge on Slagar for capturing his young ones, redeems his honor, and passes on the glory of the protector of Redwall on to his son, Mattimeo."
5,Drew Petty's Review,"Mattimeo was a very interesting book. I found it even more exciting than Redwall. I've always loved Redwall and Mattimeo really opened me up to this wonderful series. When Slagar the fox captures all the little ones you feel so sorry for Matthias and the other parents and so longing to help them find the young ones. It truly is one of my favorites and is a great book to read and if you like Redwall and tales of mice, hedgehogs, squirrels, otters, shrews, and vermin then you will adore Mattimeo."
5,"Exellent, well planned and written","All that I can say is ""wow"" After I read Redwall, which is the first part of the redwall adventures, I was ready and prepared for Mattimeo. Brian Jacques has such an ability to create worlds, great caracters, and emotion that will leave you wanting more. He has the abilty to make such evil, and bloodthirsty vilans. If you are tired of boring fantasy's, give this a whirl. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed."
5,Best book,"Mattimeo is truly a terrific book. I have re-read it about 5 times, now. The first time I read it, I was absolutely spellbound. If you have read Watership Down, you are sure to get a treat from Jacques' Mattimeo. In my opinion, Brian Jacques is a much more interactive author, who really draws you in, almost instantaneously. You quickly become attached to his characters, and keep reading to satisfy your curiosity as to what will happen next. The description of the settings in Mattimeo is brilliant, and the mysteriousness of the villain's schemes are slowly revealed as the plot thickens. The scene of the last battle was a stroke of genius. It was amazing how Jacques' was able to smoothly and effortlessly, incorporate parts from the other Redwall books into this one. And he created such a vivid mental picture, that I felt like I was fighting alongside the heroes. Mattimeo is my favorite of the 10 I have read so far. This is a great book, for those of any age, and I highly recommend it."
5,The best of the original Trilogy...,"Mattimeo gives Redwall fans something that is sometimes missing in the later Redwall novels: maturity. A sense of adult storytelling not only appealing to the older Redwall fanatics, but fascinating to it's younger readers. And more than that, it's fun, a swashbuckling tale that never gets old. Not to mention that it completes the story of Matthias and what happened after the battle with Cluny and his horde. A fine book."
5,Read Redwall first for maximum enjoyment,"I suppose Redwall and Mattimeo could simply be one massive book other than the fact that there is one year's difference between the stories within them. After reading Redwall, I decided to read its sequel Mattimeo, which turned out to be even better. As if that's possible. There can't be a word Brian Jacques doesn't know, he richly uses the English language (not abuses it, like Eminem). There's nothing left to say other than you ought to read Redwall first."
3,Good book...,"I quite enjoyed Mattimeo, but I found one minor flaw: As with other Brian Jacques novels, the plots are usually the same. Beasts get sick, or have visions, or are captured, or Redwall is under siege. But I still rather liked the book, and I would read it again."
5,Mattimeo IS A VERY GOOD BOOK!!!! BELIEVE ME!!!!,"Mattimeo is a great book. Out of the three books writen by Brian Jacques that I've read this one would be the best. The otehrs one were good, too. But this one you just can't put down; you want to keep on reading to see what happens next. The characters are great. You'll love this book!! READ IT!!!!! The other ones, too.

2,Is it over yet?,"This is possibly the worst Redwall book I have ever read. The story was incredibly long and boring and plot wasn't all that great. The other books are much better, though, even though I haven't read it yet, the newest book, Marlfox, isn't supposed to be all that hot either. Try again next time, Jacques."
5,Brian Jacques better write another book like Mattimeo,"Brian Jacques is the most incredible author i have ever seen, and Mattimeo inspires me even more. Don't read this book as a book report. Read it for fun. That will make it awesome. I love how they name all these unique foods and it makes you hungry. I am definetly going to keep reading Brian Jacques Redwall series. I hope you do too!"
5,Great Book!,"Mattimeo is the third book in the popular Redwall series. It is about a group of small woodland creatures whose children are kidnapped by the insane, masked fox Slagar and his band of slavers. One of the children is Mattimeo, son of the warrior mouse Matthias. Matthias and his friends begin a journey to find their children and bring them back to Redwall Abbey, their home. I really liked this book because there was a lot of action and humor. It held my attention because the author switched between a lot of different scenes and situations. The book told of the adventures of Matthias and the other searchers, Mattimeo and his friends with the slavers, and the other Redwall inhabitants, who are fighting off an army of birds who are trying to take over the Abbey. A great book!"
5,Fantastic!,"Slager the cruel wants revenge on Matthias and he gets the revenge he wants... This book is one of the greatest and is a MUST READ! Action, humor, and all the things you need for the perfect book is Mattimeo."
4,A Novel For All Ages,"Brian Jacques cleverly wrote the story of a young mouse, Mattimeo, and his friends from Redwall Abbey are secretly stolen by the the slaver fox, Slagar the Cruel, who wishes revenge upon the Abbey. Matthias, the champion of Redwall, with a few trustworthy friends bravely set out to rescue their young ones from the band of villains."
5,very good book,"this is another good edition in the redwall series. well its been 8 seasons since the great war and every body is waiting for the big feast but mattamio, mathias head strong son causes trouble as punishemnt he is forced into work. then Slagar the creul kidnaps bim and evry other young one. now mathias and others must go out and save them but trouble happens when there gone. general ironbeak, a ruthless leader has layed siege onto redwall. can mathias rescue his son and can the others fend of the general. read this goood read"
5,This IS NOT A Review,"... I just want to say that this is a really good book, capable of transporting you to the beautiful world of Redwall and completely away from your troubles so if you want to get away, but can't do it literally, do it mentally with this book!"
4,Mattimeo book 2 General Ironbeak by Brian Jacques,"I liked the battle between the rats and the rescuers. I liked the battle because I like fighting. Another reason is because I think it's the only good part. The good news is when they fight they don't use a bunch of high-tech weapons.The best part, you already know, is the battle. I've already explained why. The next best part was when the abbey was attacked. By what I've read general Ironbeak is a raven. He is the leader of an army of birds.The most vivid part would be the tracking down of Slagar. If you didn't know Slagar is a fox. You can uderstand this part very well. You can see everything thats happening. As you know one of the main characters is General Ironbeak. Although it is mostly about finding Mattimeo the son of Mathias the Redwall warrior. They eventually find Mattimeo, but you have to read the 3rd book to find out how they do."
3,Not The Best Redwall Book,"This is definitely one of my least favorite Redwall books, and I have read quite a few. The reason I don't like it as much is because it seems unoriginal and lacking something that most of the other Redwall books have (except for Marlfox). The characters are sort of shallow, and I think bringing Chicken Hound back was sort of desperate. Also, the character Mattimeo didn't seem that bright. I recommend that you read other Redwall books before this, preferably Redwall itself. Those are my criticisms. The things I LIKE about the book...well, there are a few. I like the character Cheek the Otter and his relationship with Basil Staghare. And I like the fact that Brian Jacques was willing to kill off a popular character (although I think this character should have had a last word. She was hardly in it at all.). To finish it up, I think Brian Jacques did a moderate job, but not the best."
4,"If you like fantasy thrillers, this book is for you!","One of the earlier additions to the Redwall series, Mattimeo, by Brian Jacques is a great book for both fantasy and action readers. When Mattimeo, the Abbey Warrior's son, along with other creatures is kidnapped, a hunt for both captives and capturers alike turn this novel into a non-stop thrill ride. This book kept me interested for almost the entire story. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting and action packed book that will keep you on the edge of your seat! Recommended ages 12-16."
3,Brian Jacque's Worst Book Ever!!!,"Having said that, let me say that his worst is by no means terrible. It just bored me to death. Now, you can go and write nasty e-mails and whatnot (I hope you have better sense than that) but the book was too long and frankly, a pain to read. I judge Redwall books on the amount of time it takes me to get through them. My average is two to three days. This one took me 2 weeks. It was torture just to get to the next page. Having said that, why 3 stars? Because, although I expect better of Jacques, he is still the master of the animal fantasy, and a witty wordsmith."
4,mattimeo,"this book is very good because it has blood, voilence, and action. I've read 8 of your books and I'm looking forward to read many more of your books.This book was a wonderful book. I just can't get enough of your books.This book is about a warrior, his son, and a s lave driver.Matties has to find his son and get him back."
5,Mattimeo,"In the book there is a feast when these clowns come, but it is Slagar's villains. While everyone is watching the clowns Slagar is poisoning the drinks. When everyone is poisoned he took all the kids. The main characters are Orlando the Ax, Mattais the Warrior, Mattimeo, and Slagar the Cruel. The problem is that all the kids in Redwall have been take as slaves. I would say the genre is fantasy because of the warrior animals. The setting is in Mossflower's woods. In one part of the book Mattais challenges the strongest of the bad guys. As he is fighting he gets tied in the bad guys net and is thrown off the edge.I like this book because off the excitement and fantasy. It has a new world. I'm recommending this book because when I began reading it I couldn't put it down. I would rate this book a 9. A kid who likes fantasy book will surly like this one.Connor M., grade 5Bales Intermediate, Friendswood, Texas"
1,product not yet received sent to wrong address,you sent all 3 books to california and they have not yet arrived here in montana they were birthday presents for my granddaughter may 9th -purchased as they are my nieces favorite series
5,Mattimeo,"For those who have read Redwall, this book will be all the better for you.Being reunited with your old friends gives you unsurrpressed joy, and seeing them with their children fills you with a sence of great pride. ( Though seeing the animals who were quite young in the previous book having children was quite awkward at first )This story is exellent and I rate it accordingly.Few things can happen to Redwall that is worst than this. First, The young ones are stolen from the Abbey, And when Matthias, Jess and Basil, along with some new found friends, whose young ones have also been stolen, are gone, some other uninvited guests visit the Abbey. General Ironbeak and his birds from the Northlands invade Redwall, at the time when most of the fighting beasts are gone searching. I would tell you more but this book but it is very complicated and wonderful. Another story for the Faithful Redwallers who adore these books and Brian Jacques."
5,Mattimeo- Book Review,"Mattimeo is a great book for people who like action. It is full of interesting journeys, and their are many problems. It is very interesting to see and hear the things from an animals perspective. Mattimeo also has a ton of humor. Mattimeo does have a quite a bit of violence in the battles, and the enemies are very violent. The good characters are very loving and caring. Overall, I think Mattimeo is a great book!"
5,Mattimeo,"It is a great book for kids 10 through 13. I liked Mattimeo because it had a lot of bad guys, action, and adventure.-Graeme Faulkner"
5,"It show's a fathers love for his son, that's what I like!!","Take a normal book, what is it about? Murder? theft? But this book is different. Sure it has kidnapping and slavery in it but this book isn't as gruesome as others. This book shows how much Matthias loved his son and didn't want him in any kind of harm or danger. I gave this book 5 stars for ability to show how much most of our parents care for us. This book is in a tie for third place with Redwall."

4,CHILD GUARD CS-100 Adjustable Firearm Safety LOCK,"Took me a few tries to get it set up properly with all the pins and such, but when you do it wont wiggle at all. As for using a hacksaw on it not gonna try it...lol Got it mainly for when there are little ones around, and they happen to find where I stash it when they are there."
4,Covenant People,"Hi Angela this Jeff Barbados, just got my hands on your CD, nice Praise God for your continue faith and musical talents, He has Bless you always, this is so nice , that I don't want to remenber the cassette. But God is good ,Thanks for the beautiful melodies and rich spritual WORD in song.May it continue to do well in the market place :BUY IT PEOPLE I AM A GOOD JUDGE OF THAT."
5,Powerful,This is the best CD's on this site. God has really used Angela in a powerful way to touch the hearts and lives of other people
5,The Best of the Best,"No chincing here. Every hit is on this CD.Backgrounds include plenty of Sax, & brass just enhancethe music that much more."
2,I hate to be a bummer,"I'm familiar with much of the mid-west music scene and when I picked up this CD I heard the same thing that I've heard when attending a Buzz Poets show... a cover band with rock star aspirations but limited imagination. It (the CD) just doesn't make you think. It's backgound music for a bad party where everyone is talking about when they played high school football. Capable, but run of the mill musicianship meets junior high locker room joke lyrics. Of course some of the riffs are catchy, but it all ends up a little vacant."
1,Hello 1994!,My friend gave me this CD. She said I would love it. Is Pittsburgh really this far behind the times? The sound quality and songs were terrible!
3,Frat-boy music,"Check this winning medley combination: Bob Marley's ""Could You Be Love"" and George Michael's ""Faith"" - the whole thing set to a Sublimesque reggae-hardcore track - complete with Bradley-ish vocals. Nirvana's ""Territorial Pissings"" also gets butchered, confirming that these guys really do go after everything that's sacred. Which is all sort of sad because their stuff isn't half-bad - they've got some great influences, after all. The sound is all very Pittsburg sweaty-frat-boy-in-a-toga-gone-funky and something Drew Carey would listen to if he weren't permanently plugged into the Bosstones. Although live albums tend to be more for the die-hard fan, the feedback and crowd noise on this one explains why the Buzz Poets won the Warped Tour International Battle of the Bands this year - these guys absolutely warrant a check live."
4,Realities of Research,"It bites you. Forget interpreting all the subtleties throughout the book, - including the title - the book is raw and real. Allegra Goodman has provided an excellent portrayal of postdoctoral life and the realities of doing academic research. The plot unfolds like a reality TV show and the characterization neatly fits in."
4,Intriguing tale of scientific ethics and office politics,"Intuition tells the intriguing story of a collision between scientific ethics, office politics and romantic entanglement. It's a very thought-provoking read. The author treats all her characters with fairness and respect, even those who may seem calculating and devious to the reader. Not until the last few pages do you understand where her sympathies truly reside."
3,"Readable, but not great -- 2-3 stars","I'm not sure why so many people rave about this book. It was well enough written, and the story somewhat interesting, though not enough for an entire novel. The characters were poorly drawn, almost as an afterthought to the plot. There are lots of bad guys, almost all bad guys, in fact, but not a whole lot worth reading, mainly dull daily work drama -- better as a nonfiction New Yorker article, I would think."
2,"Good story idea, poor execution","I really wanted to like this book. At 150 pages, my usual quitting place if I am not enjoying a book, I still didn't. Yet, I continued on. At 250 pages I felt too far gone to quit. I hoped that somehow the story could be pulled together by the end and that all those pages were not a waste of time. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed.The story in this book took forever to develop. I absolutely don't care for the characters. Correctly handled, ""unlikable"" characters are my favorite to read about. These aren't those kind of characters. I couldn't care less for simpering, self-involved Robin. The development of Cliff's character is flimsy and I find him boring. I believe the general idea for the book had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, Goodman drained the lifeblood out of it by dragging it on and on and on."
3,Gripping 'Intuition',"Working in a laboratory setting can be alternately tedious, enthralling, disenchanting, cutthroat, and rewarding. Goodman's novel covers the spectrum with a well-written style and excellent attention to detail. As a former laboratory assistant (lower than even the lab techs described in the book), I felt the Mendelssohn-Glass cancer research lab, in its scrabble for funding and fame, rang true to life. The novel follows a complex cast of characters through the trials and tribulations that may accompany groundbreaking research findings. Overall, this book was well-written and well-paced. I must admit, I found the dialogue to be a bit over the top at times, but ultimately, it was a compelling work on an interesting and prescient topic."
3,Intuition,"The story takes place in a laboratory in Cambridge, MA. As someone who dated a scientist who ran his own lab I thought Goodman presented a realistic portrayal of everyday events such as: pressure to produce results, competing for funding, dealing with the politics within the institution, etc. One criticism I have is that Goodman never clearly defines how things went wrong. But perhaps this ambiguity serves to demonstrate that more than one person contributed to the devastating outcome.I looked forward to returning to the book each day on my commute to and from work. I found the story compelling and the characters rich and interesting."
2,Was there a climax to this boring book?,"I read to the end but for what? I was disappointed that very little actually happened in this book. An earlier review said it was the scientific lab ""observed by Jane Austen rather than Michael Crichton"". True. Totally boring personal dramas rather than any actual intrigue. Give me Mr. Crichton any day!"
1,Completely furious and totally disappointed. UGH,"I cannot believe the ""universal acclaim"" this insipid, unbelievable, uninteresting book on scientific morals and ethics received. Perhaps the publishers had a REALLY swanky ""coming out"" party for this little number. UGH and double ugh. Obviously it's that or literary judgment has gone by the wayside. I was appalled by the exclamation marks in these paeans of undeserved praise -- since the book is like weak, tepid tea with a bit of mold on the edges. To compare Goodman and this work to Jane Austen is a scandal indeed! The characters are stereotypes of the first water, the events are not believable or so poorly described as to be simply dumb, and the entire production idiotic in the extreme. For SHAME!"
2,If It Only Had a Heart,"I read Intuition because it a selection for my book club. Alas, not my cup of tea. I now know a little bit about cancer research, but was unable to connect with any of the characters. Although the plot was totally focused on scientific activities and politics, it was never clear exactly what scientific deception the male lead had committed. Indeed, it was unclear which character was central. When the promising cancer research goes south, all the characters worry about their careers, but not one mentions the cancer patients, present and future, who are the real losers. I would not recommend this novel."
4,Don't Judge It By Its Cover!,"The cover of this book makes it look like this is a chicklit romance novel or something, but I assure you, it is not.It is a subtle book that examines the ambiguities between people set in the backdrop of the politics of laboratory science. Goodman is a sure-footed writer with a touch of Austen in her. I did take away one star, though, because what begins as a lab-centric little drama sort of explodes into a bigger scene. The expansion of location, environment, and stakes gets a little thin and watery in the last 1/3 of the book.**Possible SPOILER ALERT**But one of the things that I liked best about the novel was that one of its themes, which develops beautifully, is women in science. Goodman examines this concept in such a beautiful way that the final tableau is really one of my favorites in a long time."
2,Not worth the effort,"This book has been on my to-read list for a while now. I finally finished it, and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. The science is ambiguous. There are too many peripheral characters who have no bearing on the plot. Those characters who are central to the plot are not likable in the least. And finally, the motivations of each of the central characters are never truly defined. I still don't know who the real ""villain"" in this story was. And if it is who I think it is, then the author did not explain well enough how the science behind it was wrong. Basically, this book was so ambiguous throughout that I'm left unable to make any judgments of my own."
3,Engaging,"While the writing was at times repetitive and the overall plot predictable, the characters and their relationships were engaging, as were the issues of ethics and politics in science and funding. The Boston setting was fun!"
3,Not a favorite,"This book was okay. Writing was fine. Story was fine. Although I loved Goodman's ""The Cookbook Collector: A Novel,"" I just didn't find this story very interesting. I guess it is because I didn't particularly like any of the characters very much. I also didn't find them quirky enough to be compelling characters regardless of whether I found them likable. I would not suggest that others read this book."
3,Academia and ethics,"I loved the setting of this novel, the story, and many of the characters. Goodman's prose is very readable, and she writes pretty good dialogue. Intuition just didn't go quite deep enough for me, both into the subject matter of ethics at high levels of scientific research, and also in rendering the personalities of the characters. Her post-docs and professors were more complex than tropes, and behaved realistically and mostly sympathetically, but I never got that invested in their doings either."
1,Intuition or muddle?,"With each of Goodman's books I read, I said, ""not again!"" Then some review convinced me to try once more. Her stories are clever, but her writing is so banal and pedestrian that you're stuck persevering to find out what happens while kicking yourself for getting involved in the first place!"
1,Jane Austen? Honestly?,"Once every 10 years I don't finish a book I started. The comparison of the author to Jane Austen made me try to hang in there, but alas, even after 100 pages, I didn't care a whit about a single character (nor whether or not the lab results were accurate or not). Maybe if you are in this world this book will matter to you. But it's not great fiction to say the least, and to compare the author to Jane Austen is bizarre, inaccurate, and frankly offensive to the memory of a truly great writer."
5,Wonderful insight into character motivation and quirkiness,"This is a terrific book that deserves a higher rating than it currently has. Goodman's understanding of what makes people tick and how their strengths are also their weakness are amazing. In a delicious way the author illustrates how and why characters feed off each other to get their own emotional needs met. Intricate, sharp, and nicely paced. Writing a book that is both literay and entertaining is no easy task, but Goodman pulls it off nicely.Josie"
4,More Fun Than the First Two,"I enjoyed this Amelia Peabody story more than the first two. I found that it was more suspenseful, and there seemed to be really two story threads and two mysteries for Amelia and Emerson to solve. I also enjoyed their precocious little son (although the speech imdediment did get a bit tiresome). I am enjoying this series mainly because this man and his wife are both such strong and likeable characters who play against each other so well. There are a lot of laughs in this one as there usually is in an Amelia Peabody mystery. There's lot of Egyptian lore, and enough tension to keep your interest. Amelia and her Emerson set out to expose an organized group of thieves that are stealing antiquities, and supposedly these thieves are killing people along the way. Loads of fun."
4,I'm Hooked,"To be honest, I was not a mystery fan until I was given a stack of Elizabeth Peters novels as a birthday present. I gave the first three a try, because they are about Egyptology, something I am extremely interested in. Now that I have finished 'The Mummy Case,' I am hooked. Gotta go get more Egypt mysteries.The charachters in all of the books are very likeable, especially if you are interested in archaeology and history, as my hubby and I are. (I could almost imagine us in place of Emerson and Peabody during some of their arguments.) There were also plenty of humorous breaks to the suspense and drama, and just enough action to speed you through the end. Even Ramses (and I know I'm going to get flack for saying this,) becomes more likeable toward the end of the book, and his presence was initially my least favorite part of the book. That is my only real nitpick though, and I look foreward to reading more novels in this series."
1,your all going to hate me.,"I love Elizabeth Peters, and this is one of my favourite Peabody/Emerson stories. I was bought the CD version of this read by Susan O Malley as a present. What a let down. Sorry!Amelia is supposed to be English, not American. I found the reading very inadequate. There seemed to be hardly any emotion for the story through out, and it came across very flat. I was very very disappointed.Give me BARBARA ROSENBLATT as reader any day!!"
1,Suffers from too many plots & an annoying kid,"I found Ramses quite annoying, and his parents' attitude and treatment of him was horrendous. DON'T HAVE KIDS IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM; end of story. Also, just too many plots running around, although the banter between Peabody and Emerson near the end was refreshing and reminiscent ofCrocodile on the Sandbank (Amelia Peabody, Book 1), which was the best so far. I didn't understand what was the purpose of the forward and nonsense about memoirs either."
3,"Entertaining story, with one big distraction","Generally speaking I've enjoyed the Amelia Peabody series, and I was fairly entertained by this one as well, with one major drawback: the character Ramses' dialog. His speech is baby talk (spelled phonetically) throughout the book, something I found extremely distracting for its saccharine sweetness. Unfortunately, Ramses is a prominent character, so his speech cannot be avoided easily.Beyond the fact that the baby talk made the book difficult to read, I found it mildly insulting. I felt like the author didn't trust me to ""get"" the fact that Ramses is both very young and very intelligent, so the baby talk was there to continually remind me. I think Peters should have trusted her readers to pick up on Ramses' personality characteristics without having to be clubbed over the head with them every time the boy opened his mouth."
4,Amusing mystery series with an Egyptian setting,"I actually would rate this 3.5 stars, but you don't get that option here, so I bumped it up to 4. Amelia Peabody is an irrepressible archaeologist, married to the Father of Curses, the headstrong Radcliffe Emerson. Together with their incredibly precocious son Ramses, they set off for a dig in Egypt, which falls far short of their hopes for discovery of artifacts and antiquities. Along the way they cross paths with the Master Criminal of Egypt, and set about solving the mystery of The Mummy Case. Full of adventure, mystery and humor the third book in the series gives us our first introduction to the too clever for his own good Ramses. The book looses half a star, because of Ramses speech impediment, which drove me to distraction. Outside of that it was a fast and clever story, and if Amelia Peabody ever meets Indiana Jones, I am not sure who would come out the winner."
1,"Well, I'm not the only one....","I noticed that almost everyone who bought this book after its September 4, 2007 HARDCOVER release date found that this was a re-release of a 1985 book. I love Elizabeth Peters books (by whatever pen name she uses) and thought that AHA! It's A NEW RELEASE! I didn't even scroll down the screen for more information because it appeared to be a NEW Elizabeth Peters book. Unfortunately, if you're like me, by the time you read this review it will be too late. The header line for books should indicate when books are re-releases. I hope that Amazon will take note.Otherwise, I would give this book the five stars it would have received twenty years ago."
1,hood winked,this is a re-release of a book that I purchased years ago - I was gullible enough to believe that Amazon would tell me that this was a previously released novel - not so ! I am disappointed in Amaazon - my memory is not good enough to remind me that I bought this book years ago! a good read - but not a good re-read !
4,Amelia is just plain fun!,"This is not the best in the series, nor is it the worst. Amelia is fun under any circumstances. Very enjoyable."
3,"Splendid Title, Disappointing Content","Dear Mr Markson,What a beautiful, what a splendid title that The Reader's Block! This s a book I would ever dream of reading, both as a reader and as a writer. Let's pretend you never wrote this indigestible catalogue of endless comments. They made me feel that I was reading a dictionary of quotes. I LOVE dictionaries, but I had different expectations with your book. How about re-write it from scratch? Think of all the possibilities... When one cannot read a book.... Why does it happen? What is haunting the reader's head?Another point, Jacques Rigault already published a very funny catalogue of the ways to commit suicide. The book was forbidden by French government. It was a success. You come some 50 years after it -try and get it. Maybe you'll want to rewrite this book."
1,Not such a great case...,"1. It covers the port for the hands-free mike/headphone, so you can't keep the phone on your belt if you want to talk hands-free.2. It's impossible to get the phone in or out of the case without pressing buttons on the phone.3. The clip holds the case further out from the belt than is strictly necessary, so it's quite bulky."
1,needs help,"I bought this product 6 months ago from AT&T. I was walking up a flight of stairs and my phone fell right out of the case. After replacing the ruined phone cover (the main components were not damaged thankfully) I bought a body glove cover. It works GREAT. My original case would have worked fine if it had a covered keypad. As it is, it is very easy for the phone to come of the case. I would highly recommend body glove, as for this case, Avoid it!"
2,a little adjustment needed...,"The case is nice but it needs some adjustments in the way it is made... first, the part on the back of it that clips in to the belt clip holder is too low... since it is centered, it swivels too easily and does not stay upright on your belt. If the male part of the clip on the case were a bit higher it would correct the problem. Second, the on/off button is hard to push and with the cover on it, it is even harder to turn on and off. Hope you find this helpful."
1,"neither good, sad or humorous",my father has a.d. i looked forward to getting this book. this book is a self-serving piece of fluff.
1,literary piracy!!!,This book is a bad copy of The Ernst & Young Guide to the IPO Value Journey. Author didn't try to change words. Word for word!Awful!
1,Slim Pickings,"This book contained passages where the same language was repeated. Fully the last third of the book was appendices. The book does not provide any war stories and as such it has about as much interest as a due diligence checklist with a glossary of terms. The book's main advice which it repeats ad nauseum is to ""start planning early"" which is probably true but also a platitude. The book analyzed IPO performance from recent offerings, but the analysis only looks at the IPO bubble era making the applicability of the results to today's situation highly dubious. I FELT THIS BOOK WAS A BAD USE OF MY MONEY."
3,So so,"This looks to be a straight transfer of the video. Quality isn't any better. If you really love animation & wanna see some good stuff from the beginnings, this one is good."
2,not my size...,"The dress is beautiful, however, the sizing charts were deceiving. The dress has no give and is not right for busty individuals such as myself. If it fit, I'd love it!"
2,Absolutely wonderful!,"This soundtrack is wonderful, I love every song on it which is uncommon for most soundtracks. Sorry by Stretch Princess is so amazing... I absolutely love this soundtrack and it's well worth buying. If you like mellow, laid-back songs this CD is what you are looking for!"
4,If you liked the Dawson soundtrack - this is even better,"Mediocre movie, with a somewhat disturbing message, but the soundtrack is great. About halfway through the movie I had decided to buy the soundtrack. Really liked both tracks by Tara Maclean. Also just got the Felicity Soundtrack - this is by far the better of the two, much more variety. Lots of energy."
5,i shut down is great!,The movie was o.k. but i love the soundtrack. Eman song really moved me. What a voice. Who is this guy?
5,This soundtrack rocks!!!!!!!! :),"If you are a big fan of the music they play on the WB's ""Dawson's Creek,"" then you will love the soundtrack for ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle."" When I was watching the movie, I was thinking, ""Wow, I like these songs, I have to get this soundtrack!!!"" Like the Dawson's Creek soundtrack, this album has songs from artist's that aren't too well known yet, but have lots of talent! :) ""Sorry"" by Stretch Princess, ""If I fall"" and ""Seventeen,"" by Tara Maclean, ""Til I cry you out of me"" by Sozzi, and ""Misery,"" by The Moffatt's have to be my favorite songs on this soundtrack. I highly recommend this album and believe that it will make a great addition to anyone's music collection. This soundtrack truly ROCKS!!!!!!!!! :)"
2,Dead Mega pixels after 1 year....,"You got it... I loved this camera until I was on vacation in New Zealand and my mega pixels started to die. Yes, within two weeks of the first one dying... three of the mega pixels died leaving me with these nasty looking black circles in all of my shots. I sent it back to have it repaired and they told me it would be the same price as buying a new camera. So... after a year of a decent camera, I found it just didn't last for the money. I am back on the market for a new camera. I wouldn't recommend it because of that purpose and the cost of having it repaired after a year when it could also break. On the plus side, I loved that it was black and could fit in my pocket."
3,recumbent exercise bike,"fairly easy to put together, easy to use, seat back is angled a bit much for me but is usable in that position."
2,Well.........,"I don't know why I bought this, I guess it was because I had just gotten my DVD player, so I wanted to build my collection, and this was four movies for 10 bucks, so I said,'Ok, I'll buy it.THEY SUCKED!The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because of two things:1)Jack The Ripper is good.2)Lots of frontal nudity.Otherwise, don't buy."
1,Horrible,Dr. Ice cuts off close to the end of the movie. No credits or anything. Human Prey was awful. Jack the Ripper is the only justification for owning this set. I didn't even bother with 1-900.
4,Flaws and Applause,"Wensley Clarkson's portrait of Tom Cruise seems balanced and well researched. We see Cruise as a competent actor whose private life is sometimes detrimental to his reputation. The incident cited by Clarkson on page 84 confirms this impression:'Cruise was in New York's Hard Rock Cafe with his buddy Russell Crowe. To entertain the crowd, the two actors had been reciting some lines from 'Hamlet'. It was an impromptu performance and warmly received. They should have left it at that, but the booze quickly took control. Cruise, wearing a T-shirt that read 'Instant Idiot... Just Add Beer', did his hilarious Donald Duck walk along the bar while Crowe threw cell phones at him. The two finally fell into a stupefied heap and were hogtied by Crowe's friend, the Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin, and dragged out to a waiting limo. Some money changed hands and the incident was hushed up.'Wensley Clarkson's biography is a revelation."
5,Good reference,This book was recommended by my specialist and I have shared it with many! Diet is everything!
4,Cheesy as fondue and just as delicious,"This is a very good holiday album. Sure, it's kind of cheesy, but isn't cheese what Christmas is really all about anyway? The more corn you put in, the more Christmas spirit you get out of it. Plus there's that amazing cover photo of Johnny in front of a painting, mugging like he was just cast in an Old Navy commercial. And this, of course, before Old Navy even existed. Maybe the guy is hipper than we are."
3,You Had To Be There In The Beginning,"...in order to really feel any affection for this recording, in my opinion. Otherwise, this Christmas classic definitely shows its age. The young Mathis voice was nasal, not as high as some like to mention, but not yet rich, either. But, this was the first Christmas recording for the venerable Mathis, the people who are old enough to have bought the first one on vinyl love it. And it's true enough, the more familiar songs are here, although ""Deck The Halls"" remains sadly absent.To experience the voice of a more mature Mathis, buy Give Me Your Love For Christmas, with great Ernie Freeman arrangements, or listen to a couple of the songs on this recording get a fresh touch on the new Mathis recording, The Christmas Album."
1,My Christmas Wish,"I wish that just once I could go through the entire Christmas Season without hearing this effeminate little toad gargling his way through one classic Christmas song after another. Maybe it is because I love Christmas music so much that makes me hate Johnny Mathis so much. What ever happened to ""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas""? Johnny Mathis could only have made it in Vegas and I wish they'd keep him their little secret. Johnny Mathis is such a narcissist that on his album, his name printed larger than the title. When I saw that nobody had given him a one star review I knew it was my duty to point out that only women and neutered men would willingly listen to Johnny Mathis singing Christmas Music."
2,Learn to pronounce your continents dude...,"This dude only knows how to sing vowles, here's my impression of him singing misty ""ooo aaaa eeee, III aaa hhelleee aaa a iiieee uuu aa eee"" translation ""look at me I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree"". If you like a singer to sound as though his mouth were full of something, and singing chritsmas songs go ahead and buy it, but he's too hard for me to understand any of his words, he needs diction lessons, he's got a speaking imparment. Too bad these are nice arrangemets(the only reason it got two stars, and for the great songs selection). This cd as is true wit hall mathis cd's has great camp value, his music is so campy, it's so bad it's almost good (another reason for the 2 stars instead of one). This cd is a great gaga cd to play at parties everyon will love the gag, it makes for a good pink elephant gift too a great gag gift..."
5,The Most Beautiful Christmas Album of All Time,"I have listened to this album every Christmas since it was first issued more than 40 years ago. It contains the most beautiful, heartfelt, inspirational renditions of classic christmas songs I have ever heard. In particular, Silent Night, It came Upon a Midnight Clear and The First Noel are brilliant. This is a masterwork that has yet to be equalled. It IS the sound of Christmas."
5,A Must Have Christmas CD,Like other reviewers I grew up with the original record album.This is truly one of the greatest Christmas collections ever produced. Every note by Johhny Mathis rings-in Christmas. We play this CD 10 times more than any other at Christmas and no collection should be without this Johnny Mathis masterpiece!
5,A must for Christmas!,It wouldn't be Christmas for my family without the velvety-smooth vocals of Johnny Mathis. I love the traditional music this album highlights. His rendition of O Holy Night is one of the best I have heard. Johnny Mathis has such a wonderful range and vocal quality which is featured well on this CD.
5,Johnny Mathis...a great entertainer...a great Christmas album!,"What more can I say but this is a wonderful Christmas CD that has stood the test of time with Johnny Mathis. He is certainly one of the best in the industry. I especially enjoyed his rendition of 'Winter Wonderland"" with the Percy Faith Orchestra. Good listening in time for the holidays!"
5,Astounding Voice,"This CD brings back the memories. Mathis is flat out sensational on this album; an album which contains some of the best vocals to ever come out of American music; smooth, classy, laid back and filled with harmony and melody.It can't be Christmas if you don't have this thing blaring periodically from your living room stereo. It's amazing the images of family life and times gone by that this CD brings to the table. The first six tracks can't be beat. I feel as if December, snow, and these songs seem to be welded together with the holiday spirit and are a piece of my life."
5,childhood Christmas with Johnny,"I've listened to Merry Christmas by Johnny Mathis every December holiday since I was five years old. Sitting by the tree with lights sparkling, fire blazing, and Johnny in the background. Memories that will last a life time.Mike"
5,O' Holy Night,"Finally got tired of putting off replacing my original copy from the 1980s that replaced my vinyl from the early 70s. Why did i wait so long to pick up this newly remastered and i believe remixed version-i can only put it in one word-SPECTACULAR! One can now hear this wonderful recording, which may be the finest Christmas album ever recorded the way it was meant to be heard. Hard to believe this was recorded in1958, and i don't know that i've heard anything from this period sound this good. I am getting ready to a/b compare this to my old compact disc version, but this remastered version is like hearing this for the first time. Instruments just pop, the guitar is now audible, and works so well against the orchestra and strings of Percy Faith. Anyway get this in time to enjoy through the Holiday's, you wont regret it!"
5,One of the Christmas Albums ever made,Since I was a child I have enjoy Merry Christmas Johnny Mathis. with the arrangament's of the Percy Faith orchestra I recomend it to anyone and their families.
2,From excitement to dread in two chapters,"I was excited when I registered for my History of Human Rights class. It's too bad this amazingly boring book is the required text. I'm sure professors love it, but for students it sucks. It sucks the life out of every movement and episode in history by reducing them to a lifeless husk of names, dates and places. It is dense with the agencies formed to enforce human rights, but there is so little humanity in this book. I can't wait until this class is over, which is disappointing to me. I've spent hundreds of dollars on a course that I am slogging through, knowing that if I want to renew my interest in this subject I have to stay away from academic classes on this subject."
4,Quality Book,I was very satisfied with the text book. It is in almost perfect condition and was delievered in a timely fashion. Impressive! Plus I saved a lot of needed money.
2,Lipstick,The color that arrived is more orange than the color swatch on the computer. I cannot wear it.
1,The band on this watch is too short.,"The first thing I noticed about this watch was that the ""men's standard"" band length would not even make it all the way around my wrist. I am not a large man. It may be suitable for a child."
5,Excellent Film...Very Inspirational !!!,"This movie first caught my eye in a video rental store. And after watching it, I was overwhelmed, especially with Sidney Poitier being the sensational actor that He is. Of course I had to add this one to collection. The story is very heartfelt and inspiring. Not only does it is express the importance of a quality education and the opportunity it presents, but also the importance of being a mentor. This is an exceptional movie about overcoming seemingly impossible situations,forgiveness, and moving forward in life. Hopefully this film will be released on DVD soon. I also recommend another great film starring Mr Poitier: The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn. It's a must-see!!!"
4,Like to see a little more,I had to send my 1st set back because the macro switch kept sticking so I am a little concerned about the 2nd one but it has worked great for now.Takes ok pics but would like to see a better quality.
3,It's okay,"I bought this for my 3-year-old son after he played with it at a toy store for ages. Unfortunately he lost interest at home very fast. He's usually very imaginative with his cars, but this sandbox didn't inspire him much. He ended up just dumping everything in and moving it around a bit. Having said that, I think it's a great idea and I love the wooden box it comes in (although a lid for upright/less messy storage would make it better)."
5,"Fun, Hands-On, Creative Play Toy","My son saw this toy at a local independent toy store. They were out of this particular model, which was the one he fell in love with...of course. I ordered online, received it quickly, and it was exactly what I expected. The sand does have a tendancy to escape the box during exciting play, but is easy enough to clean up. My son loves playing with the construction equipment, bricks, rocks, and other elements that come with the box. I love hearing his imagination at work as he tells stories while playing with this toy. Lots of fun!"
4,Lots of fun for all ages.,My 4 year old girl and six year old boy both love playing with this toy. It will be great for rainy day fun when they can't go outside.
5,Pretty Awesome,"I love Amazon for their reviews. This is my first official review. Felt the need to share how much my son loves this sandbox. Creative, independent play inside or on the porch. He can't get enough of the construction trucks so this gave a new dimension. He has other trucks he puts in here also."
4,"Super quality, neat details","This is for a gift, so I cannot comment on how well it was liked, but I am very pleased with the detail and quality. I thought it was a tad expensive, but after seeing it, I am well pleased. The machinery is a heavy metal."
5,Love it!,We just love this. The whole family:) It is such a great toy. And what a nice thing to have when you are stuck inside in the winter. Great idea. Just adorable. Look no further. I am buying this for every little boy this year:)
4,"Oh, what fun!","This was a great play toy for our grandson's 3rd birthday. It's a perfect size for placing on a shelf when not in use, and can be used so easily. Although the playmat is a good idea for keeping the sand where it should be, we found that using rice is better and easier to clean up.I did think it was strange that the people and cones are humongous compared to the vehicles, and I also think it would be nice if the vehicles were metal rather than thin plastic. But those are minor suggestions."
3,OKAY TOY BUT...,"Bought this for my 4 year old grandson to play with along with me, but he doesn't seem to want to spend a long time with it. He does with other play but this particlar one doesn't generate the interest. We have been using it indoors and will add to get a mat or cloth to set the toy on to catch most of the sand spill over."
3,Falls apart too easily,"It is of great quality and a good looking toy and it is put together in a very clever way by matching colors and shapes. I love the puzzle aspects of the toy, and that would have been 5 stars. However, forget about play in terms of rolling or pulling. The pieces stack very loosely, so any motion knocks over the pieces which is frustrating even for the adult watching. Debated between 3 stars or 4 because it is good quality and has a great educational concept. But went with 3 stars because even if it is not used as a pull toy or a push toy, and used as just a plain puzzle stacker, you can't easily pick it up to move from one spot to another without a piece or two falling."
4,Simple sturdy and flexible stand,"I have owned the popular alternative to these Sanus stands, the Atlantic version works but they were not quite a polished as these. The powder coated finish is delicate and can be easily scratched but the units went together quickly and the hidden cord feature really gives you a clean looking result. I used the mounting option pictured but I had to flip the speakers upside down to get the bolt to line up properly. A small compromise but I am pleased with the overall result. I like how you can both rotate and lift the speakers to the perfect spot without needing to move the base at all. The speakers are well supported and the whole arrangement feels very stable. The variety of other mounting brackets mean these stands should fit any speakers I may purchase in the future. Well worth the price!"
5,fits Onkyo HT6100 speakers well,The adjustable carpet spikes and ~heavy base mount my onkyo speakers just fine using the provided 2 hole bracket's center hole and the speakers center mounting point and provided washers. Ordering another set now that I know they fit. Contains many many mounting options. I read about many other stands including other Sanus offerings and am very glad i went with the Euro style. Recommended.
4,Overall good stand,"This was the only tall enough stand (under 50 bucks) that would hold a HTIB speakers from an Onkyo home theater (they are bulky). Need to use 3M tape on all for corners to hold speakers to plate (unless u want to drill). The only downside I can see is getting them level, but otherwise the stands look great, cord is hidden in the stand body, what else do you need."
5,Works great,"I did a lot of research before I got these speaker stands. As it turns out, I have Infinity Modulus surround speakers and I wanted something easily compatible with them. These stands, though they don't mention it, contain something called a Modulus stud that screws into the ball on the bottom of the Modulus speakers. They work really well, though the bases are a little larger than I would have liked to have had. They will definately support a large speaker. The Modulus speakers are about 6 pounds and there was no problems with the weight."
2,Weight Limit Incorrect,"These stands are ok for small speakers (though still sort of bulky and cheap looking). However, the weight limit on the box is listed as 10 pounds, which is simply not the case. We put a 7 pound speaker on the stand and the weight of it bent the metal attachment and sent the whole stand crashing to the ground (luckily we caught the speaker). We set up lighter speakers on these same stands and had no problems, so it seems clear that the weight difference of the speaker caused the different result."
2,Weight limit is VERY optimistic,"Fortunately I put a dummy load on these stands before attaching my 8lb speakers. They simply do not hold a weight greater than about 5lbs. Even then, I had to tighten the clamp screws so tight that one of the threads started to strip. That was only by hand! The cost of returning these was around $20, so I have decided to salvage them by designing an alternative clamping system, and using them for another system that has very light speakers (~3lbs)."
3,Mostly Good,"Very solid with a really nice finish. Comes with an assortment of mounting plates for different speakers. However, as luck would have it, there wasn't one for the speakers that I have but I found a way to make one work.The one big negative is the height adjustment. The knob just isn't going to hold a heavier speaker. I stripped the threads on the threaded insert they used. Since I wasn't going to be changing the heights regularly (ie. ever) I drilled a hole and used a sheet metal screw to secure them."
5,Very Good,"Picked these based on the reviews here and the price. They went together easily, have lots of adapters for different speaker styles and have worked out very well."
5,Works with Onkyo HTIB speakers,"I spent some time trying to find speaker stands that would be compatible with my Onkyo HTS-6100 HTIB system. Alot of stands are made for smaller speakers, making them unstable for the heavier Onkyo speakers.I used the included L brackets in the box. I had to use nuts, bolts, and washers from my collection at home to make this work, as the included ones weren't the right size to work with the speakers. But, it can be done and looks good."
5,Pretty nice stands,"Easy to assemble, looks really nice when the speakers are on it. I have had these stands for quite a few months now and am absolutely pleased with them. They are pretty sturdy and adjust to be level fairly easily. If I needed to buy them again, I would.I think others have mentioned before how its a good idea to feed the speaker wire up through it before you put it on the base or put the speaker on top, this is so true. The wires can be a pain in the rear to put up if the pole is on the base first, especially if they have banana plugs on the ends for easy insertion into the speaker. It might take a little, but be patient when running the cable up."
2,"NICE! BUT, DOES NOT FIT ONKYO SPEAKERS!","Bought these for my Onkyo speakers, Would have had to mount them upside down to make them work. But with the included hardware, Managed to make them work after 4 hours of fabricating brackets. Can be mounted upside down, Or you can use the flat bracket, And use double sided tape to stick them to the flat bracket!? I do NOT suggest it. Spend the extra money for the Onkyo speaker stands around 50 bucks a piece. Other than that, these stands are solid heavy duty, All metal stands. But, Make sure they are made for your speaker. Do NOT do what I did! UPDATE 1-6-2013 Do NOT place these in a walkway one bump, And over they go!? Must be the 3 legs makes it unstable!"
1,Piece of Crap,"DO NOT BUY THESE.The nuts to hold the sliders are too small and the threads stripped. My speakers are now damaged as they came crashing down when the nuts let go. My speakers only weigh 5 lbs each, this is rated for 10 lbs. Most of the screw holes were stripped. Only after permanently securing the 'adjustable "" part are they usable and no longer adjustable. Not worth the money, time or effort to send back. Very poorly made."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"This was one of the worst films I have ever watched. This was due to the acting. The ships, costume and the rest were good, but could not make up for the slow ponderous storyline and slow ponderous dialogue."
4,Nice little Indie film,"This is a pretty good independent film. The story is nice, and the history is good as well. I don't know what the budget was, but it's clear the cast/director made the most out of it. Camerawork is good, and the cinematography is very interesting.... it has a very different look and feel to it that complements the story. Cast all feels authentic as well."
4,Smells nice,"The cologne smells awesome but doesn't last as long as we would like. Other than, it's great nd and the smell is sexy!"
1,Don't buy if you have an Intel Mac,"I'm a HUGE Eno fan, so when I found out about this I had to rush out and order it. The packaging is great, BUT, if you have an Intel Mac you won't be able to use it as it was completely intended, at least not with out first having to open up a separate audio file, and play through say iTunes, then you have to open up the pictures file. I must this is ANNOYING and DISAPPOINTING. Stay away, unless you have a Mac G5 or a Windowz machine!"
4,mesmerizing,This really is a piece of art rather than a piece of software - deserves it's own computer and flat-screen monitor on the wall to be left running in the living room! I love it.
2,Mostly Useless,"This book should have been titled ""Introduction To Building Web Sites in 2006"". Only two chapters (8,9) have *any* relevance to scaling, and the tools they discuss are five years or more out of date. The rest is basic stuff that any web developer should know already."
3,Way too technical for me.,"I couldn't get through it and had to end up sending it to my team of developers. The title is very compelling, but from a creative/management perspective, it's dense. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone like me who handles every aspect of Web application development except for the actual coding."
4,Tchaikovsky Through Others' Eyes,"This is a fascinating look at one of music's controversial composers seen through the eyes of his friends, his teachers, his classmates, etc. etc. Some of the articles have never been published before and lend a great look into Tchaikovsky's real life. An excellent book."
5,A wonderful biography,"I enjoyed this book very much. A must for anyone interested in Tchaikovsky's life, yet seen through the eyes of people who were close to him. Highly Recommended!"
1,TERRIBLE glue! Cheap stuff worls 10x better than this!,"This glue was terrible. It was VERY messy and did NOT hold. It was not a a penny! I have bought numerous hair glues, and this is by far the worst and the most expensive! Hate this product!"
4,great product,No mess and very strong glue. Not sticky like the others. I was a little dissapointed though because one of the bottles arrived cracked open and I couldn't use it.
3,It was nice to see Shirley McClane in this movie,"I wanted this movie bacause I enjoyed the first one. But this one did not live up to the first, which is usually this case in sequels. But it was interesting."
4,Good sequel,"If you liked Terms of Endearment, you should like this sequel. It's got a good story. I enjoy this one more than I did Terms of Endearment."
2,Great movie horrible sound,"I love this movie and was eager to see it again. However, the sound quality of the video was horrible. I wish I could have understood half of it."
5,movie,"movie arrived quick and in excellent shape, was very pleased and will be ordering more movies."
4,A Rare Sequel That Betters its Predecessor,"Despite the loss of Debra Winger and partial loss of Jack Nicholson (don't believe the trailers, folks, he's only in it for about ten minutes!), Shirley MacLaine manages to carry the film with solid support from Miranda Richardson (who turns Patsy into a comedy role and does it very well) and Bill Paxton. This film is if anything even sadder than the first, with the sadness being a little relentless towards the end. As the film requires several characters to age, the Senile Old Git make-up is employed on Shirley MacLaine rather heavily, and is a little over-done on all concerned. However the screenplay is fuller than Terms Of Endearment as it concentrates on just one character. The title sequence is wonderful, being composed of still pictures against the backdrop of well-matched opening theme, and some scenes (driving a car along the beach) are filmed very well."
5,Evening Star Rview,"I adore this movie and all the characters in it. I love Jack Nicholson and Shirley McClaine together again for the 2nd time.This movie is great for mother and daughter time, this movie will make you laugh and cry, this is one of my favorites, I am not sure what draws me to it, but everytime I am finished watching it I feel refreshed, happy. I think it has to do with the ending-I don't want to spoil it but if you have ever wondered about the afterlife or had a fear of passing on, I think this movie will calm your worries."
1,Schmaltz-o-Rama,"This film takes the cake as far as Hollywood trying to milk some sort of entertainment out of stories that were once magnificent. I didn't care for a single character except Marion Ross and was practically begging Aurora to kick the bucket because I could hardly bear another minute of this deliberate attempt by the filmakers to simply push any emotional button they could without benefit of a plot, script or sense of originality."
4,not bad for a chick flick.,"One of the best films of 1996 that was almost universally vilified by the critics but deserved better. I wont belabour the snopsis of this the sequel to ""terms of endearment"" as others have already done except to add my own praise for marion ross' portrayal as Rosie the housekeeper. She deserved her oscar nomination that year. MacLaine makes it all look effortless as Aurora Greenway and for those of us who have never heard a texan accent miss Richardson just manages to get away with it. It was also good to see Jack back again albeit in a brief cameo role. Not one of my most memorable films of 1996 but one that deserved better mention. Thats hollywood for ya..."
1,I thought this was the worst movie I have ever seen.,"I thought the acting stunk, the story was unbelievable, it was corny and had hardly a thing to do with Terms of Endearment. Why mess with a classic. Leave well enough alone."
1,Larry McMurtry deserves an apology.,"It is sad that a wonderful movie like Terms of Endearment has been reduced to a cheap soap opera with the writing of a third grade dropout. Sequels should not be made unless the original author writes them. I read the other reviews and find it sad that some were written by people that wouldn't know a good movie from bad. I am disappointed that Shirley Mclaine played the part, I guess it's all about money. I don't blame Jack Nicholson for agreeing to a small part. Ben Johnson is also much too good for this movie. He is blessed by the fact that he also missed Texasville. Very disappointing and not worth even the low price. One to miss, I wish I had. Sudami"
4,A heartstring tugger,"If you enjoy watching people's lives, you will probably enjoy this movie. There doesn't seem to be a plot, per se, but simply an unfolding of the years through various characters' lives. The acting and dialogue are superb.If you were a fan of ""Terms of Endearment,"" then you may feel a sense of closeness to the characters - you WANT their lives to go well. It is touching to see the years pass and the ""family"" draw closer together (some friends in the film are as much a part of the family as if they were blood kin.) If you are really into the film, you will laugh and you will cry. Although it's not your typical story type with a definite beginning and ending, it is well worth watching. After it is over it leaves you with some things to think about - important things about life."
3,Cool Book but Missing Something,"This is a good book, but a little light on characters, sub-plots, etc. It is a fun read (not a must read). If you're a techie, I suggest reading it, but be prepared to already be familiar with the 'little lessons' sprinkled throughout. They are a bit dated."
5,Classic startup tale,"More than twenty years have passed since GO Corporation was founded (1987), but the lessons described by Jerry Kaplan still ring true today - the name of the company might as well be any new Web 2.0 startup. How do you turn an idea into a company? The financing, the partnership dance, working with your board and executive management, the technology race, and managing your personal life are all interwoven into a complex network of events that is a life of a startup. Aside from being a fascinating story, 'Startup' is a great text for any entrepreneur filled with dozens of useful quotes and insights."
4,Great story if you can put up with the writing,"I have to agree with Mark Rushton's review below...this is a story well worth reading but one that is written with the literary skill of a dime store novelist. Kaplan can't seem to decide whether he's writing a history book or a novel, and as a result the writing gets in the way of the story a lot of the time. Nevertheless, it's still an interesting story and one worth reading. I read it at the same time as ""Apple: The Inside Story"" and ""Accidental Empires"" and the three overlapped and complemented each other nicely. (Accidental Empires is by far the most well-written.)"
2,"Get real, Jerry","This is a pretty good read by an exceedingly arrogant businessman who seems more often than not to forget that he failed and, moreover, is clueless why. His knowledge of business is about 50th percentile. His knowledge of government is at best 10th. Lots of 50thth percentile businesspeople make it. If you're naive about government - as Mr Kaplan surely was - about the best you can do is whine about that mean old Bill Gates while your company goes belly up. Read it and weep -- or laugh."
5,Incredible overview / warning of the startup process,"This is the most intense book that I think I have ever read. A real life story of doing everything you can while experiencing the pain and agony of getting squashed by forces much stronger than you.If you want to understand how hard life can or needs to be in order to overcome it, if you want to understand what competition is really about, the READ THIS BOOK."
5,An adventure in school of hard knocks,"This is a great story told from someone who lived in the trenches, soared with the eagles and then fell to earth. A true tale of the ups and downs of an entrepreneur. Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down. Interestingly it is all pre-bubble which makes it even more spectacular. Any entrepreneur will love this."
4,"What A WEIRD, WILD, COOL Soundtrack This Is!","The soundtrack to Stigmata is most interesting. So is the movie. The first viewing of Stigmata in the theatre had me listening to the music more than watching the film on the big screen. These songs are THAT GOOD!Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan and Mike Garson score the movie's music to create a perpetual sense of darkness, evilness, and general unease.Some highlights are: Remy Zero's ""Gramarye"", Chumbawamba's ""Mary Mary"", Afro Celt System with ""Release."" Natalie Imbruglia and ""Identify"", ""Inertia Creeps"" by Massive Attack. Even Ol' David Bowie charges up for ""The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell,"" a mechanical/NIN sounding (and produced by Trent Reznor) song.I can't forget to mention the beautiful, ""All Is Full Of Love"", by the incomparable Bjork.Most enjoyable movie. Most enjoyable soundtrack!Happy Listening!"
4,Love the music,"I'm very happy with the music, which is the main thing, but the CD cover fell apart when I opened the package. Bits of plastic from the cover had broken off somehow and therefore does not stay closed. This, thank gosh, hadn't harmed the disk. The music's great though, which is primarily what I wanted!"
4,An excellent soundtrack for an beautiful movie,"Stigmata was one great movie, it was casted well, directed stunningly and dealed with a deep subject with due credit. It is one of the best movies I have seen related to the subject of the church and good vs evil. Whilst browsing my favourite DVD/CD shop I came across the movie sountrack and decided to opt to buy it and am glad I did.Contrary to several people's complaints that the music from the movie was not on the sountrack, that is not correct, watching the movie before listening to the soundtrack, I did pick up 95% of the songs and the music sounds. What is most exciting about this album is that it incorporates music songs as well as music sounds that were played throughout the movie. Nearly all the tracks were supreme and yet at the end I did want to play it again. The Reflect pieces throughout the music tracks were mixed to create a mood of reflection within the innerself.Well done to the movie and the soundtrack. What a masterful masterpiece."
2,mediocre movie deserves a mediocre soundtrack,"Hardly a good tune to be found, although the Natalie Imbruglia-sung/Billy Corgan-penned ""Identify"" is amazing: ""Am I lonely/or am I just alive?"" That is a powerful song. All the others would have done better to never see the light of day."
1,Where is the music from the movie???????,"I loved the music from the movie ""Stigmata"" and was very disapointed when I listened to the CD. Most of the music from the movie is not on the CD and some of what is on there is more sounds than music. This has got to be one of the worst sound tracks I have ever heard and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Can't stand on it's own...,"Some movies have great soundtracks, you know the kind- 'I gotta have it!', don't care what it costs! Sadly, this mess of a soundtrack/score is just that, a mess. I kept wondering where the brief scores were that I heard in the film, to my horror, they were not on the disc! I enjoy my dvd copy very much with the short 'score tracks' included. As a score it would fail due to the lack of longer tracks. To combine tracks with vocals and the score on the same disc was a huge mistake. Very disappointing to say the least as I thought this disc would have some magic contained on it, something memorable worthy of keeping it in my collection, at least 1 track, but alas none to be found. To be avoided, buy the dvd instead of this rotten attempt at a score/soundtrack."
3,"one star for ""identify""","m.....Billy Corgan was the reason i bought this soundtrack,but it was only ok for the music he wrote.somehow the music score is not quite Billy-style,except for the dark-gothic-pop song ""identify"",which is so beautiful than i can't believe the vocal is Natalie Imbruglia. ""Gramarye"" is also v.good.""all is full of love"" & ""inertia creeps"" were cool but they doesn't count ."
4,"Yup, it's Corgan all right.","The instrumental tracks are mesmerizing, and unpredictable. Most of the songs are good too.. except for the one by David Bowie.. uh can't stand the guy. Retire already."
3,Tough To Master With This Book,"Didn't find this book especially helpful, or professional. Most of the ""tricks"" were based on one idea - duplicatating objects. Since version 2 info was missing, important and helpful info on such things as Web effects was missing. Using PhotoDraw elements or complete pages in a Web site was either briefly covered, or not at all. With so many references to himself, his business and his girlfriend (pictures too), I found this neither necessary nor professional. Anyone with a business name of ""Slimy Dog Grafix"" isn't very encouraging to start with. I think ""PhatoDraw At A Glance"" (also does not address version 2), along with the ""Using PhotoDraw"" that comes with the software, were the best sources of information."
1,This is an abomination against God,"Seriously, this is an abomination against God. And I'm an athiest."
1,Are We Not Ticked? This is Sucko.,"In the DVD commentary for The Truth About Devolution and the Giffels/Dellinger book, Jerry mentioned wanting to do a new version of Devo similar to the current pop tarts out there. Rather than run the idea through with a coat hanger before it had a chance to come to fruition, take the subversive/sexual content of Devo's canon, dilute with the Mickey Mouse Club and you get this piece of steaming, putrid you know what.Considering the band did back-up on these songs, would it really have been that hard simply to update their own songs for the 21st century without bringing in a bunch of kids who weren't even born when the last proper Devo CD came out? Of course not. Instead, they hop in bed with the huboons and blockheads at Disney. This should have had its head crushed a la Booji Boy.I think I'm handing in my spudboy resignation and using my energy dome for what most people think it is . . . a flowerpot.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,DEVO??,This is a very watered down version of some preteen spud kiddies trying to play Devo cover songs!!?! Total waste of money. A complete joke to true Devo fans.
4,It's a gateway,"I found an old Devo's Greatest Misses cassette in my garage recently and had been playing it in my car while taking my elementary-aged daughters to school. While the tape brought back great memories for me, my kids hated Devo. Then on a trip to Wal-Mart I found DEV2.0, noticed it was produced by the folks from Devo, bought it, and have been playing it for the last two weeks in the car--and my daughters like it!Although I can't bring myself to sing ""Boy"" U Want and I shake my head in disbelief when I hear the focus of ""Uncontrollable Urge"" changed to a passion for snack foods, I consider this CD a gateway to the harder Devo recordings I plan to introduce as the months progress.Now, if only I can get the kids interested in Zappa, too...."
3,Relax... Devo 1.0 is in on the joke.,"Yes, this is a sanitized version of Devo's songbook, sung by little kids on a Disney record. Since the Casale and Mothersbaugh brothers are directly involved, it is also Devo's greatest joke since the E-Z Listening Cassette of the 1980's. But get this - the music is actually pretty good; kids (and Devo fans) will dig it! The instrumentals on ""Jerkin' Back N Forth"" are superior to the original. Are the kids really playing? Who knows. This is fun stuff, just relax and enjoy it."
1,Terrible,"The music is not bad, but the vocals sound like she is cold reading them off the sheet for the first time. Tuneless and emotionless."
1,Craptacularly Gagworthy,"Thankfully common sense reeled me in before even contemplating buying this atrocity. I did listen to the 'samples'. I guess, Mothersbaugh got his 'revenge' on Disney after all."
4,Cute Cookies,I'm excited to use this dove cookie cutter next Christmas. The product is exactly as described and is a nice addition to my growing cutter collection.
4,cookie cutter,"Received promptly in good condition. As I was using it for a candle mold-not a cookie cutter, it was a bit lighter than I expected. But it was a great cookie cutter!"
5,"Errol Flynn in ""Never Say Goodbye""","This comedy is absolutely wonderful! Errol Flynn playing a lovable, doting and adoring father of a seven year old daughter is playing his part so well, which makes watching the movie a great joy. Many comical situations and all in the quest of winning his wife back, played by Eleanor Parker, which gives a great performance.Many people might not know that Errol Flynn was such a multi-talented actor. Another fantastic comedy of his is ""Footsteps in the Dark"", which could have been a series like ""The Thin Man"", equally as good, if not better. Furthermore, a great performance in ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" as a singing sailor, which is a definite MUST SEE!"
1,"Finding a ""Rock"" in a hard place!","Yes! The 1956 movie classic with Rock Hudson can be found in full detail on the web site: us.imdb.com - use the ""page flicker"" which has 16 pages of info. With Rock, is Cornell Borchers, a young Shelley Fabares,David Janssen & Clint Eastwood as being ""uncredited!"" Don't blink, or you'll miss him! The bad news is that this movie is currently unavailable either DVD or Video. I saw this film as an 8 year old, and even at that age, was moved by the tragic events unfolding, still, the yankees love a happy ending & so did I back then! Good luck in searching!P.S.Only 1 star for the Errol Flynn movie,but 4 for 1956 classic"
1,Never Say Goodbye,This movie was re-made and starred Rock Hudson. It's always been one of my favorite movies and I wish they would release it on DVD!
1,Disappointed !,Like many of the reviews I read customers are askingthe sames question. When will they come out with theRock Hudson version. This version was a great tear jerkerand it showed Shelly Fabre at an early age.
5,Never say goodbye,This is not the version I was looking for.The five stars are for the Rock Hudson version that I am looking for.- can anyone help me to get a copy.
5,Too bad Hunk of the Month only lasted a day:,"because Lucky O'Neill was a man I wouldn't mind having around a lot longer! JoAnn Ross once again swept me away into another world with Lucky and Jude's romance. Good thing this author is prolific, because when I sigh as I close the cover of one book, I know there's another one right around the corner!"
3,"Love Raven, and ""That's So Raven Too!""","The hit Disney Channel series ""That's So Raven"", is back with the ""That's So Raven Too!"" soundtrack. Raven's song ""Jump In"" is awesome, and I love that I can dance to it!"
4,Raven's a rave for my little fan,I bought this CD for my 11 year old. While making a road trip I put it in so I could see what it was like and enjoyed it very much. It's very good in it's content in that it doesn't have anything controversial or inappropriate. There were some songs that were remakes from my growing up which was a surprise to her that I knew the words. This CD is good for any young girl.
3,thought less,the only reason i put 3 stars is cause of raven the other songs suck i do like the aly and aj song
3,What are you looking for?,"As the author (who has become one of the top action writers practicing today) points out in his preface, this was a first novel written under spec deadlines. Juvenalia is a speciality of scholarly study. Any of us who teach literature and creative writing classes love getting hold of this kind of piece. It's all here - outline plot, boldly drawn characters, unambiguous actions : no confusion, no subtlety. This is what beginning writers need to write. But not what readers need to read. I am sure that Mr. White will grab a new group of fans; they will not be the same ones who appreciate the Doc Ford novels, unless they want to know how far this artist has progressed. So, the middle ranking. If you expect the complexities of White's mature novels, don't go here. If you are curious about his early work, or if you want a demolition derby of an action novel, this is it."
3,Not Doc Ford,"I am very glad to have read the entire Doc Ford series before coming across this book. I certainly would not have bothered with anymore of Mr. White's novels if this were my first experience. Having said that, I did enjoy the book for what it was. A first effort.Written in the style that was popular during the early 80's it is fast moving and doesn't require concentration. Anyone who read pulp fiction in the 80's remembers The Executioner series by Don Pendelton or The Survivalist series by Jerry Ahern. Same type novel, fast paced and entertaining, but not going to win any literary awards.The plot is simple. Revenge, old nemesis, killings, sex, etc. To Mr. White's credit, his introduction to this reprint edition explains the circumstances behind the publication.Perfect read during a plane flight. As I said, no concentration needed."
3,Early works of Randy Wayne White. He has the same sense of suspence although not as refined in this early work. ditto characters,RWW has the same sense of suspence that characterizes his Doc Ford series. Character development and dialog between characters not nearly as good as later work but it is fun to see how White has matured as a writer. I wonder if he is as happy with his development as I am.
1,It sucks,This is Randy White's first novel and it shows!! Read the Introduction. He gives the read sufficient notice so you have no excuse.
3,Decent Lab Book,"I bought this book for its simplicity and ease of use for both myself and the students. I use it for my AP chemistry class and although I like it, some of the chemicals required for the lab are quite expensive and uncommon. The one thing I do like is the appendix which provides in structions on how to make your own lab accessories which are very practical and easy to do. I recommend this as a reference."
1,Kaizen Pocket Handbook,This booklet might be useful to an executive in a large company. However for the average person wanting to use kaizen generally in their whole life it's not very helpful. I also think it's overpriced for it's size and content.
3,Its okay.,"If you're into non-traditional Indian cooking, as in you like trying new and creative things that are Indian-style but are not the typical Indian dishes, you will like this. There are more non-traditional recipies than traditional ones. So probably not the best book for someone who just wants to know how to cook the main Indian dishes. The healthy part is great. Every recipie has a nutrition guide with how many calories, fat grams etc. there are per serving. There are not pictures to accompany every dish, just a few of them. The reason for 3 stars is I wish they indicated somewhere that the dishes are not the typical Indian ones..."
3,Contract Book,"I know I was buying the book on the cheap. Unfortunately, the binding on the book has already come loose and the pages are falling out. I realize that this is more a reflection on the publisher as opposed to the seller."
4,My man a fool!,Shandozia is not afraid to try something different and it reflects in his unorthodox style of singing. I respect his heart to experiment and the finished product is tight. Thanks for breaking the monotony Shandozia and don't change pimp. I'm also diggin the guest appearences in the video! You a fool!
3,easy to messy up if you live in an apt.,"This one is kind of fun. However, it is smaller than I'd hoped for, and if you live in an apt. (which I do), it's easy to mess up the room when your kids play with it. Though the product comes with a plastic sheet to protect the sand spread all over, it is with little use. But I guess it would be OK to play in yard."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I really enjoyed the first Arabesque compilation so I thought I'd give this follow-up effort a try. I was disappointed to find this one is very inferior, at least for my tastes.I felt the original Arabesque struck a perfect balance between loungey electronic chillout music and traditional Arabic instruments and musical styles. Tlata 3, however, veers away from the electronic, dubby elements and focuses on real instruments and singing, which wasn't really what I was looking for when I bought this (I miss the techno!!!) In particular, I found the focus on the male vocals very jarring, and the music sounded overall disjointed and uninteresting to my western ears.To sum up, it's probably a good sampler of traditional Arab music and my inability to appreciate it likely stems from a certain amount of cultural closed-mindedness on my part; my only point is just don't buy this expecting it to be similar to the original Arabesque."
1,POINTLESS,"I was totally flabbergasted when I saw that this film was rated so highly by some. Sure, I understand that the girls are in a strange Neverland where the formation of the clouds doesn't even change, but after all is said and done, it was the most pointless story I have ever seen or ever wish to see. No stars for this one!"
1,Wonderworks - Odile & Yvette at the Edge of the World,"This Video is already in the land fill. Does that tell you what I thought of it? I watched 92 minutes of 2 girls running away from their father, twirlling around for the camera, going into this bazarre fifth dimention where what you want to come true does. One girl wants a boyfriend,and gets him. The boy likes her sister so the first girl shoots him. Within minutes each girl is acting is if nothing has happened. Twirlling around in sunlight. In the end they wave to a train as they finally decide they want to be back to civilization. Stupid stuff like that is NOT family entertainment. Wanna waste your money on garbage? Buy this one. This is a Wonderworks DOG!"
3,needs improvement,I've had this nailer for about 3 years now and shot through several boxes of nails. I've changed my original mark of four stars to three stars. I've been having some major problems with my nailer double shooting. I haven't had these problems before but they are occuring more often which tells you something about the integrity of the tool. As a cabinet maker this has caused me a lot of extra work fixing the damage. Not too mention the danger factor. Another issue is the fixed exaust port. It would be nice to ba able to control its direction. And finally the nails Senco uses have a more round head on them which makes for a bigger hole to fill. This bigger nail head also tends to spilt the wood more. I'm putting this nailer on the shelf and looking into Paslode or Bostich.
4,A good working man's tool.,"This tool is excellent for finish carpentry work in home building . As I do extensjve finish work for Habitat for Humanity, I need a reliable finish gun that does outstanding work. This gun meets the requirements in a great way."
5,Habitual reading at its highest,"This is the first book that I have ever read by Eric Hammel. Originally I had checked it out from my local library, but it was so outstanding and difficult to put down, that I purchased this book just to have my own copy. I want to read this book again and again. In fact this book has led me to purchase the Guadalcanal triology authored by Mr. Hammel. All books are now in my possession and a reading adventure that I will enjoy for years to come. Mr. Hammel's writing style and the amount of detail he includes will keep you on the edge of your reading chair late into the night."
5,Excellent History,"I cannot add very much to the reviews which the esteemed folks have already made. I will say that the story is well told, very personal, and is tightly constructed. More maps are always needed in any naval book, even guesses at tracks would help the non-grognard. Good book, excellent historian, I recommend it to anyone slightly interested in this intense time when the IJN and the USN were nearly evenly matched."
1,wrong book,"these reviews don't refer to the mentioned book "" The carrier battles"" , but to "" Guadalcanal decision at sea"" from the same writer Eric Hammel. Please check out."
2,Sounds more techno than spiritual,"I listened to the samples at B&N before I got this cd, but it sounds much different than I expected. It's like a combo of native american sounds with techno. It's not bad, but I plan to resell."
1,Zero Stars,Well since my last review was no placed let me rephrase is. This is the worst album by Douglas Spotted Eagle. No traditional music left at all. NOthing compared to Pray and Closer To Far Away or all the older stuff. A complete sell out.An extremely disapointed fan
3,Nice Tea Kettle,"Tea kettle has a spout which opens automatically when you tilt to pour. If you support it from the bottom, you can even fill the kettle from the spout rather than from the lid. It has a nice consistant whistle but there are a few faults. A little bit of water does sputter from the spout upon boiling and the handle does get somewhat hot as well. Due to the shape of the bottom, you need to use a medium flame to heat it. But all in all, I do like the kettle. The inside is enameled so hopefully won't rust (mentioned in instructions but I think is for stainless steel model) and I like that it is slightly smaller in size, holding about 7 cups."
1,Not what it appears to be,"I bought this as advertized, a Canadian French dictionary. It is no such thing, just an ordinary ""Franais de France"" dictionary *published* in Canada with NO CANADA-SPECIFIC CONTENT AT ALL."
4,The Real Stuff,"This is definitely the best X-Dream album so far, and quite possibly the greatest trance album out there. X-Dream continues to prove the have what it takes to create trance music that doesnt get boring, repetative, or even annoying, despite the average song length being around 9 minutes on the album. They also have found some really catchy and moving sounds to stick in with the beautifully edited synth. Tracks 1-4 are just a non-stop journy....the sound is incredible. 5 is not your normal trance song, but after that the album moves back to standard X-Dream songs. The only reason I didn't give the album 5 stars is that I feel in order to give an album 5 stars, it has to be perfect(so far I haven't found a perfect album). While not perfect, it is their best album and they are continuing the trend toward perfection. I'd say around 94% though. Get it now and find out!"
3,Cardio work out with a capoeira influence.,"I ordered this video to learn more about Capoeira. The thing was that it turned out to be a work out video (as the title suggests). There are some nice clips inserted every now and then of some Capoeristas during their training session (most of the scenes taken from the Beginner Capoeira video that I also ordered from amazon). Carla Ribeiro's workout is a good one, relaxed yet you'd probably break into a sweat. There are some nice tunes dubbed over the sound. The sound was not good in some parts though, with some cutting. To conclude: if youre out for a video to learn about Capoeira, I suggest you get another one, but if you're out for a paced work out with an interesting touch, then this could be for you. take care :)"
5,Satisfied,"Dear Sirs,I'm glad to have purchase this video. Now I have a video which I can watch the day and time I want.The quality of the video is very good and i enjoy the video with my family and friends each time we watch it.ThanksBest regards,Glenn"
4,Still a Classic,"I love this movie!!! I was wanting to get all my favs on DVD or Blue Ray, to continue my collection updates. I still have this movie on VHS, but what I did notice with this DVD is a scene that I didn't remember (Stoney sitting with Cleo on the couch crying after her brothers death) and a scene that seemed edited (them sitting around the table aka the Godfather Scene, Frankie never took the cotton balls out of her mouth like on the original) All in all it's still a classic, and arrived quickly."
4,Queen Latifah,"This movie was fun in the BONNIE AND CLYDE sense of the word. It's a good flick to watch if you want to laugh, cry, and shake your head to a decent soundtrack. It's a good film to chill with--just don't over analyze it. The best part of the film was Queen Latifah, who was so much fun to watch. She steals the show every time she is on screen, and it kind of makes you wonder why she doesn't make more movies and why she isn't a bigger star. Great job all around."
1,Never Received my Product!,I have contacted DVDmagnetinc twice about my order. It has been over a month and have YET to receive it!
2,IN TOO DEEP,"It was the middle of the night and nothing else was on, so I watched this. It was terrible, although Jada Pinkett Smith is a good actress and you can applaud her character's desire to get ahead in life to help her brother go to college. Unfortunately he is killed by police who mistake him for a criminal. So, Jada and her cohorts, played by Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox and another girl with whom I am unfamiliar, turn to a life of crime robbing banks themselves. Pinkett Smith was not cut out for this life of crime, though, and finds love with a bank employee (Blair Underwood of LA Law and City of Angels fame). However, she finds herself in too deep with her friends and their bank robberies, so they plan one last heist, only to end up in very big trouble. Pinkett Smith is the only one to escape (she goes to Mexico), but the story is just not held together very well."
1,Utter garbage,"How this got approved to be filmed is beyond me! It is nothing but trash, pure and simple. Yo, it ain't nuthin' but a ""g"" thang (""g"" for garbage!) Do your self a favor and skip this self-indulgent piece of defecation."
5,I Am always Pleased with My purchases!,"When Ever I am in the Market for Blu- ray's I only purchase from Amazon. My family and I Will always Use Amazon, for Our Movie viewing needs."
3,smh,They all dysfunctional friends the one wid the kid should had pickd her friends a lil bit better she don't belong wid them
1,Not enough DVD glue.,"Couldn't watch the whole movie. The DVD separated (clear plastic on bottom, thin shiny disc on top) in a couple of areas and the player couldn't read it. Bought it elsewhere."
4,It's Not Good To Love Money Too Much,"The issue with the story is that greed is bad. It's also a story about love, a universal subject. There are two different types of love here: heterosexual and homosexual, which is great because people should be true to themselves not just so they'll sleep well at nights, but so that they'll attract people who'll love them the way they are. I love that Blair Underwood and Jada Pinket-Smith have great chemistry. It's so beautiful to watch. I love that they talk about trying different delicacies, which is great because diversity is a great thing. I also love that they talk about their accomplishments because we should all have positive goals. I took out a star because a major theme of the film is about robbing banks, which is a very bad idea. It's also a film about stereotyping people, which is a bad thing to do. So in a nutshell, diversity is amazing, stereotyping people is wrong and don't rob banks."
5,review,Received order in the time promised. Movie was in great condition and with no scratches. Very dependable and will order from again.
4,"""Set it off like Vivica!""...(Notorious Big)","I ordered this one through Amazon, it's a classic and has Jada Pinkett in it...(pause for the cause)...she is fine! Ok, back to the review...I ordered it and it came within a few days which was cool cause, I really wanted to check it out. I won't go into the movie, you can read up on that if you choose but as far as my experience goes, I enjoyed the movie when it first came out and I still like to watch it from time to time. Ordering was easy and I suggest it for anyone's movie collection. YMMV. NEOSOUL06."
3,"Like it, don't love it.","This is my first raviana cd. I did the whole thing through and then put together bits with the ""Matrix"" option which is interesting and easy to use. There's a lot of things I like about this cd - the instructions are clear, I like the stripped down feel of the set used and I thought most of the music was appropriate.Then there's the things I don't like - the production values seem really amateurish. The sound is poorly recorded with too much reverb and the occasional echo, and I find that incredibly distracting. Which is of course my problem :)So I'll keep at it."
4,relaxing,The layout of this DVD is just beautiful. But I personally have a hard time following it because it's hard for me to just sit there with almost no movement chanting the same thing over and over. My mind is always racing so his is a challenge for me. If this sounds like you I wouldn't get this DVD. But me personally I would like to learn to slow the mind down and master it so I'm going to try and keep at it.
4,meditation dvd,"I have several dvd's by Ana Bret and Ravi Singh and this one is good as it concentrates on meditation solely, a bit unusual to find in a dvd. As meditation is an integral part of Kundalini yoga , I would recommend it as an addition to daily workouts -- meditations vary in length of time and focus, and can be designed to suit personal needs using the matrix option which is very useful, depending on time a person has to meditate each day ."
1,The Mood and Look is Distracting & Frustrating!,"I have a library full of brown-haired Ana Brett DVD. If you are a die-hard Ana & Ravi fan, you'll know what I mean. I've seen many reviewers make the following remark, and it is still too true: Avoid DVDs with blonde Ana! Whoever they hired to ""update and glam-up"" their look and sound did them a huge disservice! With all due respect, what made you different Ravi & Ana, was that you had a simple sound and look; and, you had an understated class and grace! Please, bring it back -- it is your Sat Nam (true you is what it means!). I'm returning this DVD and following my instincts: stick to the brown-haired Ana and all will be well."
1,Very Displeased,"I recently purchased this item along with the Kundalini Yoga for Beginners with the Matrix Menu Option for my brother who has never tried Yoga before. I purchased these two DVD's solely on the reviews from others who seemed very pleased with them. All I can say is that I'm glad I previewed them before giving them to my brother because they were the most bizarre form of yoga I've ever encountered. If you enjoy panting like a ""happy puppy"" and performing other odd moves, you may enjoy them - otherwise you'll find yourself put off and highly disappointed. Two thumbs down in my opinion."
5,Thoughtful Sci-fi at its best!,"I read this book the first time when I was about 12, and it totally changed the way I thought. Basically, it's about perception, about the way we filter all our thoughts through our already existing experiences. By doing so we miss opportunities to process truly new information. Although I recommend this work on the strength of what I got out of it, it also works simply at the level of a good story: well written, easy to read, creating a believable future world. I certainly agree with the assesment of another reviewer that this classic deserves to be much better known!"
5,"Fascinating read from the ""classical"" sci-fi era","This book comes from the optimistic phase science-fiction went through, where aliens were benign, it was humans who were the problem but the problem is fixable by those aliens. The plot is largely a mechanism for delivering a specific world-view, which is spelled out very clearly many times. As such, the story can be simplistic in places. Arguably, the book fits into a special category of science-fiction termed ""speculative fiction"". These speculations are more philosophical than scientific, but it does make for a good read. It was definitely written with a libertarian mindset, so if that's not your cup of tea, this probably isn't a book for you. This is not High Adventure, but Intellectual Adventure, and those who enjoy such stories will likely enjoy this book."
2,No Table of Contents,"I'm LDS and love the Book of Mormon, but this version for the kindle isn't good because there is no table of contents and you can't go from chapter to chapter. There needs to be better Kindle version out there. Any suggestions?"
2,do not buy it! it is FREE,"Please do not buy this book you can get it free, the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints do not charge you for this book. you can find a church near you or contact the missionaries.you can also visit the church website [...]Thank you!"
1,Got Jipped.,"The product IS NOT as great as the picture shows. Not even remotely close. I purchased a couple in fact, the wood is much darker in color (and not even a ""cool""-looking dark wood). It is dull and flat in a worn-out rather than stylish sort of way. Did I mention small? I'm lucky to fit 2 pieces of my sushi on it while it advertises to be a great server piece. If you buy this product, perhaps you will be satisfied with it...but beware- one was sent without a pair of chopsticks, another with BROKEN chopsticks. The packaging was awful, just letting you know, if you care for your merchandise. And the moral of the story is- DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!, because at the end of the day, they will not let you send it back....sheesh!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"The people have WinStar have done it again. Have they NO shame? Once more, they've dubbed in LOUD, obtrusive sound effects that RUIN the experience of watching great cartoons. And you can't turn 'em off; you are stuck with the sound of a mallet hitting a board every time Popeye takes a step.This collection is a disgrace and should be pulled from the market until somebody with RESPECT for the original animated treasures releases them. I will NEVER purchase another WinStar DVD release."
1,all about bypassing public domain,"these are basically reworked with cheezy new soundtracks etc so that they don't fall into the public domain, as they should. get the originals in a decent format instead!"
1,The Fleischers Deserve Better,"Once again, the folks at Winstar have desecrated the classic works of Max and Dave Fleischer by providing obtrusive ""stereophonic"" sound effects and variable print quality. Avoid this video and buy Republic's ""Cartoon Madness."""
3,Nancy Swayzee Breathworks for your Back audio cassette,I am trying to buy Nancy Swayzee Breathworks for your Back audio cassette.But the price listed is $192.13. !!!!For two audiocassettes?I think the decimal place must be two places off.Please tell me how to get these audio cassettes.
2,Hunting killer lions isn't much of a story,Why the lions were vicious or strange is never explained. Movie tries to make a story out of wild beasts protecting their lair. Would rather spend my time watching a National Geographic with does of reality.
5,Must see,This is an older movie again that most haven't heard of but it is definitely one to see. Great action.
1,This is a stupid sequal,"I went to see this movie, and it was a waste of my money and time. The overpiced hot dog I had was better than this animated flick. They need to create new animated characters and not a cheap sequal."
1,I'd give it a zero if I could.,"Wow! What a load of crap!!!I want the 100 minutes of my life back that I wasted while watching this movie. My 5 year old hardly even giggled during the movie. Frankly, I think he was mostly freaked out by it."
1,Not worth watching.,I saw it and really didn't care for it. Not very original and certainly not as good as the first.
1,I Don't Understand,"It beats me how this movie even got FUNDING. Dancing penguins? Completely inappropriate! The children around me in the theater were clearly upset, and I left feeling violated. Absolutely dreadful!!"
1,0 Stars If Possible,"Not a very good movie. The first one was better, and this one was a big let down. Okay voice acting but it seemed like they weren't even paying attention to their lines at times."
1,"Good, but the MPAA is evil","This movie was ok for very young children, but as it is associated with the MPAA, I dont recommend buying it."
1,Atrocious in every way,"When I saw this movie, I was expecting to a least be moderately entertained considering the actors who are playing lead roles. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The plot had little to do with anything meaningful, the acting was kind of okay, the general feel was just... uncomfortable. Another atrocious movie that I would not recommend to anyone."
1,Horrible movie...,"I wouldn't spend single dime on this movie, i found it terrible and very bland. If you are looking for a better movie you are better off with something not....lame."
1,Not so happy feet,"There isnt much to say about this movie. It's as bad as bad could be. The story is bad, the songs are horrible...if you would like it, it's because of it's enormous crap-factor. An unhappy smile :( for the unhappy feet"
1,"God cant save this movie, nor would he.","This movie is so horrible. its main goal is just to cash in on the first movie. infact, go watch the first movie! right now! its better than the sequel. i cant erase how horrible it was from my mind and now i wish that i could just kill myself and it would all be over. oh and sony, YOUUUUU SUUUUUUUCK!!!! YOU AND THE MPAA!!!"
1,I can't believe I paid money to go see this! Waste of time. Don't subject your kids to this. It will lower their I.Q.,I went to see this in the middle of the day for a matinee. The kids walked out of the theatre. It was that bad!
2,Kids were uninterested!,"I watched this movie with three children (ages 3, 4 and 6) and none of them seemed to stay interested in the first or second Happy Feet movie.I thought it was a cute movie but perhaps it is better for older children?"
4,A solid four out of five stars,I took my 11-year-old daughter to see this during Thanksgiving (2011) break. We argued about whether to see this or The Muppet Movie. She won. We both loved HF1 and she thought this was just as good. I bought the DVD to accompany HF1 and I also sprung for the Muppets while I was at it.
3,I saw this at the theatre,"I saw this at the Theatre and the first one is definitely better. This is not bad though, and still entertaining enough. This one is more for kids than the first one, but there are some good parts in it for adults too."
2,Boring compared to the original,"We loved the original Happy Feet movie, enough so that after seeing it in the theaters we bought it on DVD and also later on Blu-Ray when that was on sale. Happy Feet II was a big disapointment when compared to the original, boring and a stupid plot. We only paid two dollars to see it in the theater but I still felt ripped off. Don't waste your time!"
3,It's a kids movie,"Definitely not as good as the original, but RARELY are sequels as good as the originals.We saw this in the theater and my daughter wanted it for her birthday, so far she's watched it a half dozen times.As far as writing and character development goes, this movie lacked it most every department... the songs were pretty cheesey, the characters were cheesey, and the story was a little (dare I say it) cheesey. HOWEVER, it had a few funny moments and when you let go and realize that you are NOT watching some masterpiece that's going to change the face of the movie experience... it was a pretty decent movie."
5,Happy Feet Two,An enjoyable movie very entertaining a good one for children to see everyone has a talent or can do something special
4,"Good songs, Cute characters","I don't understand what all the fuss and bad reviews are about. I thought the film was adorable, my 58 y.o. mother enjoyed herself and my 6 y.o. had a blast watching it at the movies in 3D. Characters were cute, premise of working together was nice and the music fun! From a baby penguin singing and dancing to ""walk-it-out"" to my personal fave, ""Under Pressure""...what more should one expect from the Happy Feet franchise??"
1,Worst movie ever,I see this in the theater with my girlfriend and I have to say that it was the worst movie ever. I would not recommend this movie to anyone ever not even to little children 3 out 10.
1,Worst children's movie sequel EVER.,"I was fortunate enough to see a free advanced screening of Happy Feet 2 (Two) this weekend. Unfortunately, this is probably the worst children's movie sequel made to date. Unlike the first Happy Feet, Happy Feet Two does not have a story or message; nor does it have much to do with the first Happy Feet (other than most of the original characters/ voice actors).This movie is simply just a weak excuse to sell tickets (during the Thanksgiving weekend/ holiday-- what a coincidence) of the 'newest 3-D movie', AND because it's a name (Happy Feet) that many people/ children recognize! Do yourself a BIG favor, don't be a victim of this bad movie. If your children absolutely insist on seeing this movie-- save your hard-earned money and watch it during the Matinee (half price) Hours; or better yet, convince them to watch another movie."
1,Sad-f00t,"And, I thought the first one was bad...One more thing...The MPAA can to shove this crap back into their black hole."
1,Horrid movie,One of the worst films I have ever seen even my five year old sister hated it. Do not buy!
4,Family Fun!,"This movie is very enjoyable for the entire family, and it moves fast. My four-year-old absolutely loved the music and the dancing scenes. One of the few movies that he has watched entirely."
5,Entertaining and inspirational,This is an awesome movie. The first was good. This one is even better. I have watched more than 5 times within 2 months.
1,wow,"this movie is so bad i don't if words can adequately express it. everything, from the soundtrack, to the animation, to the voice acting, to the script, is downright appalling. a 5 year old could have made a better movie. avoid at all costs!"
1,DO NOT WATCH!,"This is a terrible movie. Everybody knows that sequels suck and this one is no exception, if anything it further perpetuates the idea that all sequels suck."
1,Absolutely horrible,"This is a base plot line, incredibly bad animation, and taught mixed values to any child that watches it. The MPAA should be ashamed of themselves for letting this garbage come to fruition"
1,Horriable,"This movie was not for me at all, a complete waste of time. This will most likely be used as a door stop."
1,I mean REALLY!!!!,This movie is terible. I mean REALLY Terrible. LOL. Is this the best that Hollywood can come up with?? I mean REALLY!!!
2,Poor Remake of the first movie,"Watched with this my sister, it's basically just a remake of the first movie. Tries far too hard to be funny and ends up falling on its face, don't waste your money on this one."
2,Shoulda Woulda Coulda,"This ""cartoon"" is a prime example of what is wrong with Hollywood. Too much Holly and not enough Wood. Getting a couple of celebrities and slapping together much poorer CGI animation is inexcuseable. Don't waste your hard earned money on this turkey."
1,can't believe how bad this movie was.,I was amazed by how bad this movie was. I watched it with my little cousin who will normally watch anything. She practically started to cry. I would not reccomment.
1,Sequel Cash-In,"Another sequel cashing in with little attention to plot or character development, opting instead for showy graphics and cutesy appeal."
1,Terrible!,"This film was HORRIBLE! Was such a waste of money! I pretended to have a stomach problem to excuse myself from watching the film with my friends, who also left it early because it was so bad."
1,Rather Bad Kid's Film,"I do not recommend this kids animated film to anybody. There are some cute movies out there better than this one. This one is just atrocious! The first one had decent graphics and kind of cool concept. Happy Feet Two is absolutely the same, but actually worse. The songs they picked are horrible. CGI is worse. Worst of all they continue with the racist depictions of the penguins! They have these smaller sized penguins who speak with Hispanic/Mexican accents, and, SURPRISE, all they care about is females. How much more racist can this get!?Avoid at all cost, don't waste your money."
1,Happy Feet,"Happy Feet One was a total mistake. I'm sick of Penguins, too. Stay away from this awful film unless you like being annoyed."
1,i almost killed my self,this movie was so terrible i almost killed my self in the theater and i saw it with my niece
1,Happy Feet Two,"Back in 2006, WB had a hit with Happy Feet, an animated film about an emperor penguin named Mumble who couldn't sing worth a lick, but who could tap dance his tail off. Fast forward five years, and the inevitable sequel, Happy Feet Two, hit theaters last November. This time around, Mumble is all grown up with a kid of his own, Erik, who refuses to dance like his papa and runs away, only to meet Sven, a unique penguin who can fly. When the entire population of emperor penguins is trapped by an iceberg, Mumble must bring all his friends together to save the day and win back his son's respect. Unfortunately, while the first film was worth watching and took home the Oscar for Best Animated Film, I wasn't too thrilled with Happy Feet Two, its is narrative noisy and incoherent, even if its animation is expectedly top notch. It's not terrible, but it won't be taking home any awards either."
1,Just not good at all,"I admit that I was no great fan of the first Happy Feet. I just couldn't get involved in the story at all and the tap dancing aspect was just sort of ""meh"" for me. I definately didn't think Happy Feet deserved a sequal and when I sat down and watched it.... I found out that I was absolutely correct. It was just a poorly written movie with unlikable and annoying characters. On top of that, I just found it boring. I doubt it'll hold your kid's attention and I certainly don't think you will enjoy it very much. Plus, considering the corrupt buisness policies of the MPAA, pouring more money into their pockets is not a good idea for you at this point. Save your money for something of much higher quality entertainment."
1,DO NOT BUY,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Spend your money on anything but this! I want to kill myself!
1,bad,"Worst movie i have ever see. Saw it in theaters, total waste of my hard earned movie. I cant imagine it being any better on dvd, its sad how little effort these companies put into sequels"
1,AWFUL,Saw this movie with my mom. Hated it! NEVER SEE IT! ITS AWFUL! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! It was like the first one but with newer characters!
1,What a waste of money,"I thought I had seen some bad movies in my time but this movie sucks the biggest this year, it was honestly more entertaining staring at the carpet."
1,Epic Fail!,Gawd this movie was horrible. I waited for it to come out such a long time and then it turned out as great disappointment. Could have spent my money better.
1,Should I watch this movie? NO,"Though the original was a good movie, this movie is an utter failure. The film shouldn't be considered a film, but a cash in. Though the animation was quite good, it cannot save this disaster of a movie. If you want a movie to entertain your kids, try renting a classic, such as a Pee-Wee Herman movie or Looney Tunes. Trust me when I say that this is a horrible film, because it is."
1,It's Garbage,I went to see this movies in theaters and I'll say it wasn't worth it. Don't buy this stay away.
1,Why Can't I Give This Zero Stars?,"I went to see this movie awhile back and it was the worst $10 I ever spent. While I felt the acting was good, the rest of the film was pure trash. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this film and subject yourself to this garbage."
1,Terrible Movie,A sequel to another awful movie. I would rather have my eyes gouged out than watch this again. I will never get the time back i spent watching this crappy movie.
1,It is nothing like the first,"First was amazing, this was created just to try and take your money. Was horrible! Go watch the first one, leave this one alone!"
1,Probably one of the worst movies i ever saw.,"Happy feet 2 is really not a good movie in so many ways.First, the plot about betraying your friends and family for fame and money is a good thing, are not values i want to teach my children.It just blows me away that they couldn't find some decent voice actors. Most of the time they were just mumbling and you couldn't hear what they said.The animations were bad and looked low budget. And the reuse of animations were over the top. And the scenery looked cold and static.Trust me when i say. Dont buy this movie.It is just a shame that i first found out while watching it why they call it ""number two""."
1,...,"Sorry, I'm still waiting for a good movie to come out that actually keeps me entertained for a longer period than 20 seconds."
1,Sad Eyes and Ears 2,"Don't buy this movie.It just isn't worth it.On the other hand I really recommend ""Big Buck Bunny"" - 4 out of 5 stars."
1,saw it in theatres i would say skip this its horrible just pure garbage,"very repetitive and boring. Its EXACTLY THE SAME plot line only with different characters obnoxious humor and terrible voice acting. Also the animation was horrible and it looks so rushed. Even children will not like this movie, thanks Hollywood again for wasting our time. don't even think about buying or renting this terrible film."
1,meh,"couldnt hold my attention at all. Nothing really exiting ever happens, the movie feels like something is going to happen pretty much the entire time. But doesnt deliver"
1,What were they thinking.,"This will go down as the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of animated films but without Plan 9's humor, wit, more coherent script or better production values."
1,Don't see it,"I saw this with my 10 and 12 year old daughters, and they hated it. Honestly, this is just a waste of time definately a no buy, maybe a rent..."
1,An abomination,"Honestly, the title is enough. Please, do yourself a favor, don't buy this. I have entertained myself more looking at the wall."
1,Snoozefest,Absolutely awful. I think I fell asleep in the theater trying to watch this movie. Not even my young relatives would enjoy this.
1,This movie was so bad!,It was really not worth the time watching this movie. I almost fell asleep quite a few times while watching it! I drank coffee and everything. This movie is just so bad...
1,Sucked,This movie was horrible. It's a typical flop sequel. If you've seen it once then you already know the story. Almost as bad as Alvin and the Chipmunks.
1,Good movie to put your kids to sleep,"It was a good movie to put my 3 kids to sleep in the movie theater. I don't know what violent reaction you will get when you loop this over and over again. Terrible, terrible movie."
4,"Not as great, but still good","I dont know why people have reviewed this movie so low. I took my three year old to this in the theater and he loved it. While I do not think it is a good as the first movie, it is very cute and heartwarming. I was nervous they would not find someone to replace Brittney Murphy, or do her character's justice, however Pink stepped in and wowed me. She did great as Gloria. If you are the parent of a young child, or someone who enjoyed Happy Feet, at least give this one a chance. It is not as awesome as the first movie, however its still cute and worth watching. (maybe more so if you have kids)"
2,"Meh, Not the best, but not the worst","Honestly, This was not my favorite movie. I took my 12 year old step son and my 5 year old niece to see this shortly after it came out. My step son actually fell asleep and said it was boring. My niece said It was really cute to watch the penguins but the first one was better. Thank god for popcorn or it would have been a total waste. Take my advice and watch the first movie instead, it was much better."
1,i wish i was blind and def,this movie makes me regret being born. it is HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT EVER WATCH OR BUY THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE!
4,Happy Feet 2,This was a great sequel to the first one. My family really loved it. Would love to see more adventures from the little guys.
5,Happy Feet Two,"Good movie, enjoyed story line, not too short and not too long. Gave it as a gift, but was also able to view it myself."
5,A Movie that brings people together and breaks differences.,"Great Movie for all that is, yes, profund but yet so simple and brings us back to what really matters: Love, Friendship, Unity, Courage, True Leadership, in the midst of difficulties, trials, and hardship. Goes back to the basics of honesty, honor, and happiness. Eric put is so well when he sang, ""...Pretty Lies..."" are those empty promises and pacts. It gives us a little insight as to how important parenting is and relationships with sons and daughters are, as well as how much they are greatly needed. We need examples worhty of being followed and honored. I can see why there was so many one stars...maybe we are too used to seeing movies that entertain, but yet have no significant values or principles that are so real and down to earth. As shown in the movie, even the little things can be so significant."
1,Very very disapointed!,Totally disappointing! I really expected more of this movie. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone! Really! Don't buy it. The movie is not good!
1,Avoid at all costs!,I regret ever stepping into the theater and giving away my money to see this terrible film.I personally enjoy the actors but this movie is the absolute worst! Save your money!!
1,Do not let your children watch this.,"Do not let your children watch this, unless you want them to be mentally stunted. SUCH a cheap grasp at recovering some of the original vigor and well polished cgi, not to mention scripting of the original happy feet."
2,Disgusting,Really not worth seeing. I feel like there are many better ways a company can produce a film but this is simply not one of them.
2,NOT SO HAPPY FEET,"I am not a reviewer from the alleged blog that submitted 250 negative reviews of HAPPY FEET TWO. With that being said, I must say I wasn't impressed with this sequel. Despite its message (which has been employed countless times), its just not that entertaining. The characters aren't that interesting and the music doesn't match the quality of the original. The dance sequences are mundane and the voice characterizations aren't that inspired. I really had a hard time watching to the finish, but I did and just found it ultimately dull. The film's weak box office will hopefully negate any future sequels."
2,Disappointed,"Pr-ordered the DVD, was very excited because my daughter and I really loved the the 1st Happy Feet. The sequel was lacking the very thing that made the 1st one wonderful, the singing and dancing. There were about half the singing and dancing than the 1st one, loved the baby chicks but it should have been so much more. This was a let down :("
1,Meh..,The movie was boring and poorly written. No one laughed at any point. This movie will make your kids dumber.
1,Awful. Simply awful,Seriously how could a film be so bad. It reached a whole new level of badness. The film company should just shut down and stop making films
1,Don't bother,"Another prime example of them trying to cash in with an uninspired sequel. The plot is completely predictable and dull. There's nothing to figure out. Not a very stimulating movie at all, even for the young ones. I'd recommend saving your time and money."
1,Not interesting,My kids were not interested in this movie. Super boring. They wouldn't sit for the whole thing. I often find kid movies boring but I deal with it for them. I was happy when they didn't even want to finish this one lol.
1,Terrible,"Terrible animation, terrible dialog, terrible acting, I just don't know what is going on with this movie studio. They use to make good movies."
1,Terrible Movie,A total waste of time and energy. Could not recommend it to even my worst enemy. Go buy something worthwhile!
1,Bad movie!,"Happy feet Two. No words to how bad this movie is. For the few people who gave this movie a good review. Ether you worked on the movie or you need to get your head examined. If your kid is 2 or younger and you don't care what your kids watch, then fine put this or Barney on your tv. Any older then you would be wasting your kids time. End of story."
1,A film Travisty,No one should ever watch this film. Don't support this awful crap. Oh boy do I hate this movie. you'd be crazy to see a stinkeroo like this stay clear be glad you did
2,Crappy Feet,"It could be that im only 14 but this was stupid... Its a bunch of mainsteam music with dancing penguins. Its ghetto, its cheesey and they try and take the ""cute fluffy penguin"" thing too far. It was like haha! penguins dancing! for the first few minutes but after that i just got bored of it. it was meh..."
1,bad..,Don't watch it! The plot is unappealing and dull.Just save your money and go buy something else or just watch it online for free.DON'T BUY IT.
1,Bad,I really did not like this movie. This movie was not my favorite. I dont know what the deal was but the comedy was tasteless and the humor was bland.
1,My feet were not happy,"Saw this movie and my feet were not happy. What a waste of time and money. Do not but this or rent it, you will want your time back."
1,Just no.,"Do not see this movie, your eyes will bleed. The first movie is always the best. ALWAYS. This movie is a waste of time."
3,Like the first one better.,I have a 3D Vizio TV and 3D LG player so I try to find cheap 3D movies.I like the first movie better.Still a good movie.
1,Wow just awful.,"Well done another food stamp for WB at the cost of a good film, don't watch or buy.The first one was good this was awful."
1,These penguins deserve to be euthanized.,"Why? Cause this movie is utter garbage. The voice acting is shoddy and surprisingly, WORSE than the first movie. Where the first movie was cutesy, this movie is just plain dumb. I honestly could spend an hour describing how crappy this POS is. Please parents, actually EVERYBODY, do not waste your hard-earned dollars on Happy Feet Two. With the way the MPAA is being run now, it's actually not very surprising that the quality of a lot of movies is going down the drain. Quality used to describe feature films not too long ago, but unfortunately, it doesn't anymore. And it CERTAINLY doesn't apply to Happy Feet Two."
1,Don't WASTE your MONEY!,Save your money for something else. Playing a game with my kids would have been a better use of time.
1,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this DVD, DVD's aren't the way of the future,download only is,support independent groups of movies and let's get some quality out there not so say that this movie is bad or anything just maybe the MPAA."
1,is bad,is bad is soooo bad do not buy see something els wacht something els because it suck so bad is some stupid
1,Terrible,"This movie was nonsensical, random, and downright strange. It had no parts that resonated, the singing hurt my ears, and the shrimp thing was just odd. I would not want to watch this movie again. The only reason I watched the entire thing was because I was on a plane"
1,What were they thinking?,What were they thinking? What a waste. I feel sorry for the people that were involved in its production. That is really all I have to say.
1,"Absolutely nonsensical movie , definitly not worth paying for.","This movie sets the standard for what has become the norm in film making. It is, make a ""good enough movie"" and and then just make the sequels preatty much a prequel to the third movie. No substance or resolution to the problem presented and the ending presents a problem that you can only fing in a 3rd , and the resolution of the third is in the fourth. No thanks if my kids want to see it I'll borrow it from my friend."
1,not so happy feet,This movie once again proves how hard it is to make a good sequel. This was a disappointing two hours we would have been better off to have watched that documentary about the emperor penguins which I can't even remember the name of.
1,Happy Feet not so happy,I saw this animated crapfest on a disc in the store. As far as I could see it just a lame attempt to recycle the old and tired ideas and characters from the first movie. Save yourself some money and skip this one.
1,Nope.,"Terrible. Movie wise, it's nothing. It's not funny, it brings nothing to the table. It's one of those sequels done solely for cash in. Shame."
1,ghaaa,Why they even made this movie - I have no idea. The premise is as terrible as the first. A movie about dancing penguins? Is this all hollywood has left?
1,What did I pay for?,Sequels are never good and this was no exception. Animation was as poor as the voice acting. Don't waste you money on the MPAA.
1,Gross.,"This movie was a major dissapointment. So much worse than the first, please don't waste your time with this one."
1,Do not bother,"Listen to all the other review and do yourself a favor, do not get this movie, you will be glad you didnt."
1,Meh,"The MPAA sells vapid and disposable movies, this is just another movie that will soon be forgotten. I am not at all impressed by it, and I implore everybody to investigate the MPAA and their corporate lobbying and illegal use of coercion to get politicians and ordinary citizens alike to shut up and not have any opinions contrary to what Hollywood sells."
1,Happy Feet Two,I thought this movie was horrible. The first one was okay but the second one is just trying to steal your money.
1,Not For Me,I really am not a fan of a genre who puts animals in a musical and has flashy colors to entertain kids. I also love JeepersMedia. LONG LIVE MIKE MOZART!
1,terrible,"worst kids movie ever, i never thought it was going to be that bad when i went to the movies to watch it. Boy was I wrong, it sucked"
1,Worst Movie ever,"Do not watch this movie is a waste of time, I wish I could get my money back. worst movie ever."
1,Embarrassing and corny.,"I saw the DVD over the weekend and it was just awful. The thoughts corny and embarrassing quickly came to mind while I was watching it and it pretty much describes the entire movie when finished. I think if the horrendous dancing and singing snippets were taken out entirely it would be a much more enjoyable movie. I mean come on we have to listen to ""walk it out"" and ""under pressure"" being sang by penguins? Horrible."
2,Lots of real movie critics gave it bad reviews,"There's no propaganda with these low-rating reviews. Lots of other ""expert"" movie critics didn't like it either. Go to rottentomatoes.com to read what top movie critics around the country are saying about it."
1,garbage,"Was terrible, took my kids to see it and they didnt even find it as good as the first, and i didnt enjoy it nearly as the first as well they dropped the ball on this one."
1,The Popcorn was great,This movie was absolutely lacking.. I don't know what it was. I felt like I payed $8 for the popcorn and drink...
1,It sucked,This movie sucked soooo bad. Don't ever buy it. It sucked and ones again IT SUCKED!!! I would rather spend a day with justin bieber than watch this crap.
1,Cashing in,Seems like the MPAA is trying to cash in on this one. Really really shoddy work compared to the first one.
1,Happy Feet 2,"This movie is such a waist of money, for the amount I spent for my 7 year old, 8 year old, and myself (plus snacks and drinks) to see this drivel at the movies I could have bought more of the same snacks and just let them watch cartoons at home. It would have been the same experience; flashy colors, catchy music, and no point to the story."
1,it sucks,just don't give this to your kids it will make them lose brain cells and i didn't even know a movie could do such a thing
1,Inadequate animation to say th,"I don't like movies with bad animation, lacklustre lighting and piss-poor storylines. Acting could be defined as worse than any foreign film I've seen in the past 8 years. I do not recommend Happy feet 2 at all. Simply awful. Bring your kids to see this? They will be bored to death and probably end up hating penguins."
1,this is horrible,I would have rather thrown my money in a well than to watch this movie it was soo bad i cant believe i watched this movie
1,Horrid...,"A horrid film, bad voice acting, terrible graphics. Would not watch again and would never, ever buy. I will tell all my friends to never watch another terrible movie like this, ever. THIS movie was made by an art school graduate. Worthless. Hell on plastic,"
1,Just another lame remake.,"This movie is just another blatant money grab. It's predictable, boring, and not worth you time. Even my small children didn't like it."
4,Very good music by the composer of Giselle.,"The second quarter of the 19th century is particularly interesting because it marked a blending of the Classical and Romantic periods. The vestiges of Classicism gave a special charm to the early Romanticism which dominated this period. It this period which produced the great bel canto operas of Donizetti and Bellini and the piano music of Chopin. In this special period Adam wrote a number of charming ballets, the greastest of which -- and, indeed, the first truly great ballet -- was Giselle. Although La Filleule des Fees is not the masterpiece that Giselle is (but then very few other ballets are on a par with Giselle) it is a very charming ballet, ably conducted by Andrew Mogrelia -- who appears to be have a particular affinity for Adam's music. If you like this type of music don't pass up this 2-CD set"
5,Fits Great ...,"Bought this for my 2002 Concours. Installed quickly and easily, without the need to remove or even unbolt the tank. The four clips hold the cover in place very well and allow the installer to stretch the cover slightly in order to keep a tight fit. The backing is soft and the cover can be removed just as easily, in the event of a spill or removal of the tank for maintenance. I think that this cover will provide good protection from scratches by belt buckles, among other things, and it looks nice too!"
2,weak song,"Javine sure can sing, but this song has no melody, is very repetetive and was meant to get her career back on track...which failed, because at the Eurovision contest it didn't win many points and was rather unnerving"
4,Light hearted love story set to awesome music,"If youf your spirits need a lift, Jit will put a sparkle in your eye! It is the story of U.K, a young fellow (Zimbabwe) who tries to raise money for the bride price of the girl he loves. Because he is hard-working and industrious, this would all be easy enough were it not for the beer-guzzling incestral spirit (jukwa), who continues to thwart his plans, getting him fired from every job he finds! There is also the fact the the beatiful young lady is being courted by the richest guy in town. Through it all, U.K. keeps a good attitude and a sense of humor that kept me laughing the whole time. The film gets off to a bit of a slow start, but quickly picks up the pace. The showcases great up-beat music called Jit, which accounts for the name of the film. Jit is a wonderful addition to any video library."
3,My review of the Givenchy Amarige,"My mother really liked the product. However, it took a long time to get product delivered to her."
3,"Thought provoking, but something was missing.","LOST FUTURES takes on the fascinating concept of alternate realities: the theory that at the point of any given choice, reality splits and continues on for each outcome. In this book, a young woman becomes obsessed with the possibility of crossing over to a better life, where her brother did not die, where she made something more of her life. Thankfully the absurdity of quantum theory is abandoned early on, but after a series of several ""awakenings"", one begins to look for some kind of direction, and there isn't any. There is an ending of sorts, but it comes suddenly. A mild disappointment, but still worth reading."
5,melamine cutting blade,"I have only cut a few pieces so far with this blade in my table saw so I can't tell yet how long it will stay sharp but so far its flawless. I cut 3/4"" melamine coated particle board with absolutely no chipping."
2,Not very good.,"I bought this video, and a beginners video on capieroa. This tape kept my interest for about 15 minutes. It's like watching a workout video where all the instructor does is sway. There are no verbal instructions, so you have to just watch and figure it out yourself. There's no challenge, and the model was not very good at doing it in the first place. I'm very disappointed in the price I paid for the video. It wasn't very good."
3,The only book on programming 3DStudio Max,"First of all, there isn't really anything else on the market, so if you have to write a 3DStudio plugin this is it. On the otherhand the coding examples are only average. As in learn to code somewhere else, and just use the API exposed in this book to do the plugin. Don't have global varibles everywhere. Use standard library containers, don't write your own."
2,I should've known,"Honestly, I was kind of excited to see a book written about Maxscript and the corresponding SDK. Unfortunately, this book is mostly MaxScript and some SDK knowledge. As stated in another review, it doesn't help you master anything; it just introduces you to it.Also, notice when it was written. This book was published for MAX R3. Since then, about 70% of 3dsMax functionality has been added to the package, so this book is absurdly out of date. I would not recommend it over the current help-file included in 3dsMax."
1,Poor quality and unclear presentation,It would not work in the vehicle I purchased it for.Instruction are very weak and poorly written. The instructions assume the user can read between the lines and understand the process if additional parts are needed.The instruction should have been acceptance tested.
5,GREAT TOY,My daughter got this as a gift at birth and it is her favorite toy. I have had not problems with quality. We bring it everywhere to entertain her.
4,A favorite,My child started loving this toy as soon as her hands could grasp onto it. Its visually and texturally interesting for little ones. It has now lasted us 18 months and still gets used on occasion! Its definitely been the one toy she has that has interested her through a variety of phases.
1,Do not buy this book!,Used this as the textbook for our basic college electronics course. It is riddled with major mistakes that made it impossible to trust any information. It is impossible to do many of the exercises without extensive knowledge not found in the book. The explanations are often difficult to follow. Definitely not for the novice. I would stay away from this book!
2,"Thoroughly Error Ridden, Little Support","I used this book in my undergraduate career as a physics and math major. I took Electronics Instrumentation as an elective because I genuinely wanted to learn the material, but I was sorely disappointed in the text. Besides being riddled with typos and errors, I found that the book was of no use as far as giving solutions (or even answers!) to any of the problems at the ends of the chapters. Additionally, I used the lab manual that accompanies the text, and it was equally error-ridden and unsupportive. It was as though no one ever proofed the texts prior to publication. Overall I think that with some editing, added solutions, and attention to student feedback this book could be a good resource as it covers a broad range of topics, but as it stands it is lacking."
1,Buy this book if you're blind,"This book is terrible. Having used it in an introductory physics course in electronics, I found it to contain many errors. It also lacks many of the proofs that give the student a solid foundation in electronics. The problems at the end of the chapters are fuzzy and don't reflect on the main topics in the chapter. Some of the problems are even dicked up and should be thrown out."
2,A little pricey,"The book seems poorly edited, the presentation of the basic material is too short (a large portion of this book is data sheets), much of the mateial in the exercises at the ends of the chapters is not discussed in the text, and there ar no solutions provided. On the other hand, the book does some good in its short and to-the-point explanations of some basic to intemediate ideas in modern electronics, and it is up-to-date. I would not reccomend this book for self study, but it should work fairly well for an introductory course at the undergraduate level- as long as the instructor covers the material left out of the book."
3,Decent Book,"This book does a fair job of explaining the background of the electronics world and the apllications thereof, but the problems are either extremely simple or massively difficult. Even worse no solutions are given to any of the problems at the end of the chapters."
1,very sparse on detail,"This is a horrid book for beginners. This book is more of a reference for those who already know what they are doing. There are almost no examples and there are no solutions or hints available. Here is an example of my problem with this book. Chapter 5 has literally five sentences on voltage multipliers. I counted. From this, it expects you to know how to design your own."
4,Massive and magisterial,"This massive study of democracy's advance in the US from 1800 to 1861 is brimming with careful and original research. There are 796 pages of text, 156 pages of notes, and a detailed 96 page index. I liked that the study of each election for President and each Administration was carefully explicated in lucid prose. It is hard to see how the subject could be better explained. I thought sometimes explanations were more detailed than necessary, but I found the book masterful and very convincing in showing the pretty steady advance of democratic ideas, even though when it ends in 1861 there are still huge advances to be made in Americah democracy. .After reading this book no one with an open mind can doubt that the Confederacy came into being because the South wanted to keep slavery and the myth of the South wanting 'freedom' is thoroughly shown to be untenable."
5,A MUST BUY!,"This book is 100% real! This IS for the Wizardry community! The author is a great person, and he is an acutal Wizard! He also runs a Wizardry school online! You should buy this book!"
1,Insulting,Not for the novice. Insulting to anyone whom has been practicing the craft for any period of time. I would not recommend it to anyone whom was serious.
5,Nice book.,"I like the way everything is explain, easy to read, nice knowledge to get, amazing drawings, I didn't like the way everything is related to harry potter it is oriented for a teenager, but everything else is pretty good for novices, I recommend it, it has a lot of things to learn."
5,Old Apprentice,"Those who think themselves beyond the 'apprentice' level in the study of magick and ritual (or even performing magic) will miss out here is they don't get a copy IMMEDIATELY. As I was not raised in any related culture base, my views on many subjects presented here in fine fashion were disjointed and incomplete. Now I have a ready reference which is also 'fun' to read. I now have a much clearer view of where I want to focus my future studies.Anyone even scanning this text will find themselves renewed in appreciation of the magick they do all their lives -- and of the role they can play in opening the minds and hearts of apprentices everywhere, either young or old."
2,Good but misguided.,"Other than it being directed at the younger audience, my only other problem with this book is that the author blatantly badmouths Satanists, I guess religious tolerance doesn't count with that path, and needs to freshen up his knowledge on herbs. The last time I checked, garlic was not poisonous. I would not recommend this book to any beginner on the Pagan path without supervision from a more experienced and knowledgeable Pagan. Overall, there is some decent information, however, it's got some hiccups along the way."
2,Good but not great,"This book has some good stuff in it, don't get me wrong. I think one of the problems with the book is it tries to fit too much information in a small amount of space. My biggest problems with this book is he makes some blatant errors when it comes to the topic of history and some minor errors in the mythology, especially the Egyptian mythos. I think the author really needs to go back and hit the history books to make sure his timelines and histories are correct, which as the book stands now, they are not. The other major issue I have is his section on Psychic Vampires, it is WAY OFF!!!! Real psychic vampires are not clingy, soul sucking monsters like he describes. I hope he puts this book back out with changes to his errors and readsThe Psychic Vampire Codex: A Manual of Magick and Energy Workand fixes those horrific errors regarding psychic vampires."
2,Fun ready but fluffy,If your idea of learning elemental magic is going scuba diving and think the best way to defend yourself against the dark arts is to avoid smoking or joining a gang this is the book for you.
5,Wonderful for beginners,"I loved this book. It is wonderful for beginners as well as others. It's written for the younger witchs out there, but I think that is why I liked it so much. It was easy to read and even gave you assignments like homework. It is one of the only beginner books I have read that wasn't a drag. The only problem I had with it was some of the color & word meanings; they were not the same as any of my other books, so watch out for that."
4,Where did they go?,"Let's just say I heard them back in the 90's, I got a cassette which with time it got broken and I wanted to hear these songs again. They're not easy to find anywhere, so I decided to buy the CD. It was almost a miracle to find it in Amazon since this band was a one hit wonder ... well probably not so wonderful, but they had good songs. I wonder where they are now."
1,Don't Waste Your Time With This Pretender,"I remember reading an interview article with Joe Louis Walker in Guitar magazine in the late '80s. Among other things, he made a point of disparaging Stevie Ray Vaughan as someone who didn't know how to play blues or even know what blues music really was. Of course, Mr. Louis pointed out that HE knew what blues music was all about. This high-brow, arrogant attitude really turned me off to him as a person and a musician. If Mr. Louis spent less time copying Robert Cray's chops and spent a little more time working on his humility, maybe he could be more than a second-rate guitarist jealous of those who have gone before him to greater mass appeal."
2,UNCOMFORTABLE,"I bought these boots exclusively for stomping around in deep snow while walking my dog. I guess for what I paid, I got my money's worth, but the rubber is so hard and inflexible that i had to wear thick socks just for the walk up the block! The fit is incredibly uncomfortable. I ended up buying a pair of Columbia boots (@29.99) and I can wear them daily with no issues. These have been relegated to the barn, but no one wants to wear them."
3,too Tight!!!!,"The boots look exactly like the picture. I recieved the boots a few days before the holidays as they were a gift for some one for the holidays. The boots are very nice comfortable. However, they are really tight in the calf area"
4,century 84320 arc welder- worth the money,"This is a decent welder. It is stable at the amperage levels. It can be used on several applications. Very easy to use and understand for the intermediate welder, but could use more instruction on the guaging for steel welding. It performs well, although I wouldn't reccomend hard wiring because it decreases its mobility for alternate applications. All in all, I am pleased with this product and would reccomend it for someone who knows how to weld or a beginner who wants to learn."
1,"Great title, terrible book","This book is nothing more than a great brochure. Too many ""holes"" in this one."
1,Old & Tired,"I did not enjoy this book, nor did I find the information contained in it to be new, innovative, or thought-provoking. It's the same old ""treat your employees well"", ""make technology work for you"" rhetoric that I've heard for 20 years.I was hoping to use this book for one of my classes in an HR PhD program. No way -- I learned more than what is contained in this book in only one of my undergrad classes."
5,A fascinating look at an American original,"Krispy Kreme doughnuts are a way of life in my homestate of North Carolina, but other parts of the country are catching on. ""Making Dough"" is a well-researched look inside the doughnut company and how it became a national phenomenon.If you like Krispy Kremes, you're guaranteed to learn something new and interesting. But even if doughnuts aren't your thing, ""Making Dough"" shows how a small company can become a big-time success."
2,Good Pieces Between Shameless Self Promotion,"After finishing Trump's Art of the Deal, I moved on to Making Dough. This book is one step above go dog go and reads like a guide to why Krispy Kreme is great written and published by Krispy Kreme (I thought marketing literature was supposed to be printed on all glossy pages?).There is little advice presented that would be easily applied to your own buisness, unless you are a KK franchise holder. This is amazingly disappointing since I love the product.My Advice.... Go to the library and take the book out for free, buy a few gallons of gas to get to krispy kreme; Buy a dozen doughnuts; Sit and skim the book for an hour, you will still be up $5 which you can spend however you want."
2,"Too much rah rah, not enough facts","This thing reads like an advertising company wrote it for Krispy Kreme. I was hoping to find a bit more in depth history, and what led to the leveraged buyout from Beatrice Foods in the 80's. This book offered 3 mere pages on that. It does not talk about the competition, as far as this book appears, there is none.Sure, the doughnuts are great. For those looking for an unbiased view of the franchise, however, keep looking. This book is nothing more than a written commercial."
5,Review for Wlordsbcry,"This game is awesome! Good graphics, variety, and just about every thing else! Buy It! Be sure to get flaming arrows a direct hit sets the enemy ablaze! Burn baby burn!"
5,Great Game,"I've only played the demo, but I liked it so much that I am ordering the game. It is one of the first RTS games that has an actual balance not a this unit is the equivalent to that unit for that race but is a little better so will cost more, as in StarCraft. The game's sides seem very well balanced in the demo and from what I've heard in the full version too. I could say more, but the only other big thing is the RPG mixed with RTS that was a very good idea."
5,Just one word WOW!!!,"This has got to be the best game i've ever played in my life it's like warcraft times a million. You get a special charecter and you can make guys and fight against the opponent. I really liked it because I personally LOVE the whole wizard, elf, dwarf, magic thing. So if you feel the same way buy this game!!!"
3,"Fun, Entertaining, But Not Spectacular: Very ""Warcraft 2ish""","A very sturdy, carefully-crafted game that I've played for 100+ hours, Warlords Battlecry delivers the goods in a workmanlike fashion. However, as an RTS game with a ""pause"" capability, Warlords Battlecry didn't make me say ""Wow!"" like Warcraft did. There are some games (Myth, Homeworld, Civilization, etc.) that when they were first released amazed us by either their graphics, gameplay, novelty, etc. Warlords Battlecry, using 2D graphics, same resource collection methods, etc., just doesn't add up to a ""must"" buy. You probably should find a demo first, although this game isn't risky. If you've played Warcraft, then you know Warlords. That's the point. (So why do I play Warlords so much? 'Cause if I buy a game, I'm gonna play it!!)"
5,Warlords Battlecry,"This is a great game! I've only played the demo but i'm looking forward to purchasing the real game.The hero feature is really cool, thats what separates it from all the other RTS type games. Customizing and developing your hero give it the RPG element. This game is one of the first RPS's. I hope to see more like it.Also in the editorial reveiw above one race was forgotten, the Barbarians."
4,"Well, we're establishing a trend here...","I too have only played the demo, but I think this game has good potential, and I'll order it soon, but it appears to mix the successes from several games quite effectively. The Hero concept is remeniscent of the Shaman in Populous (Right game?). The races aren't quite as radically different in as in Starcraft, but it's enough, and I'm not sure if balance is an issue or not; I think that a small group of archers with some eyrie support could take down just about anything, and towers do far too much damage, but it may all even out in the end; I'll write something more complete once I've tinkered with the full version..."
4,Cute Cozy,"When workers at the Crozet Hospital begin turning up dead, Harry with the help of her pet companions Mrs. Murphy and Pewter (the cats) and Tee Tucker (the dog) begin searching for the killer. But before they can solve the mystery, more bodies turn up, and soon the police and Harry know that the murder is someone whom is an acquaintance to everyone in the samll town of Crozet, Virginia. Now they just need to find out who.This was a very interesting cozy, perfect for animal lovers. My only pet peeve about this series (as another reviewer stated before), is the amount of characters. The story can become quite confusing when there are characters such as Big Mim and Little Mim. But the story is still good, and quite interesting, and will have readers thirsting for more."
2,Boring,"The Rita Mae Brown series is better suited to a TV show than a book. Very little description and lots of dialogue.In my opinion, Carole Nelson Douglas is a much better writer. Her descriptions are glorious, she is full of humor and Midnight Louie has a wonderful personality. Her characters develop from novel to novel. I highly recommend reading the Midnight Louie series. Can't wait for the next book!"
5,OUTSTANDING VALUE!!,Outstanding value. All lightweight alloy construction. Best value and function on the market!
4,like it,"chose this to go with my theme of fire fighters, and they arrived on time, looking just like they looked in the picture.my son was so happy with these, he has saved all of them."
3,"Only nine, not ten","I purchased these for my wife to give as a gift for a friend, but we only got 9, not 10. These are designed for feeding; they don't work as well when children attempt to hold their own utensils; the handle is too long and straight for that. But we only got 9/10ths of the order and I just never got around to writing to the company about the shortage to see if they would correct it."
1,Unable To View Harriet The Spy - Wrong Region,Tried to play Harriet the Spy on DVD player. The disk indicated that I did not live in the appropriate region to watch this DVD. I live in Indiana! It indicated it could only be viewed in Region 2. A check indicates that there are six different regions for DVD's. I live in Region 1 (the U.S.) Region 2 is Europe. The vendor knew where I lived because they shipped it to me. I will not order from them again. I cannot afford to spend money on something I cannot view.
1,Mean spirited,"I couldn't continue watching this mean-spirited show. Harriet is not likable, going through their classmates and viciously listing their shortcomings. Why does Hollywood think being nasty is equivalent to being witty?"
2,Irritating,"I think a lot of the characters in this movie are very irritating. In fact, all of them were accept a few of the very minor ones. The book is so much better because the kids in it weren't obnoxious and there was no Rosie O'Donnell anywhere in it."
5,Greatest movie made by Nickelodeon,"I've read some of the reviews and think some people didn't even watch it. I mean, they probably heard about from somebody who hates Nickelodeon. I've been watching nickelodeon for 13 years(or my whole life) and it is a great channel. Now about the movie, it is about a girl named Harriet who is 12 years old and is in sixth grade,and loves to write and likes to spy (in a good way) she has a nanny named Golly (Rosie O'Donnel) her parents are not like the ones on full house who hug all the time but there the average 90's parents. She has two best friends named Sport and Janey,(sport is a comedian, and Janey is a Scientist ) The best part is when they start school and Harriet rates all the students. This is a movie for kids and adults, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will also make you want to watch it again and again."
3,ok movie,"ok for starters, the acting is not bad and I actually like how the scenes were shot, but I had some trouble with the plot/actions; girl likes to spy and write things down; she loses her notebook and her friends read all about themselves; she doesn't apologize to them; they are mean to her and she is mean right back; she doesn't explain any of this to her parents even when she gets brought home by a cop; finally at the end she does apologize and she gets her 2 best friends back; so as I wacthed this with my 7 and 9 yo I had to stop and ask them what she should have done; I will say it is better than the book as it takes even longer to have her finally do the right thing, but even then in the book she doesn't go up to her best friends and say she is sorry face to face"
2,Not as good as the Book,"This book was my favorite book when I was little (I am now 17). When the movie came out, I found I did not enjoy it. The script followed the book loosely. I found my imagination portrayed the story better than the movie. I enjoy the Nickelodeon channel and the actors/actresses in the movie, but I strongly feel that if a movie is going to be made from a book, they should follow the book and make the characters like the ones from the book."
2,"Midly entertainitng, but a bit off","Parts of this story are entertaining, but parts of it tended to bother me. What really bothered me was that Harriet did some mean things to people in her class, but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong. She seemed to tell Harriet to pretend to be sorry, even if she wasn't sorry. That attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book."
1,IF THERE IS ANY WORSE MOVIES TELL ME!,"Lame dumb jokes my grandma said when she was 7 years old. No good plot- line. And the cast is unbearable. Having rosie-odonnel and her lame jokes is cheesy enough to give this movie 2 stars. If there was zero stars as an option, I defanitly would pick that. P.S. I fell asleep 15 minutes into the movie, don't waste your time and money on this film that looks like a monkey put together. I reccommend good burger if your looking for good nick movies. But don't pay attention to this crap"
1,"Creepy, disgusting script","Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of secrecy and evasiveness that (in a kid 2 years older) could be a sign of bad things like drug use, shop lifting, or bulemia, as in the movie ""Thirteen."""
1,Best movie since land before time part 6!,"There are 88 used copies of this movie for sale, starting off at 33 cents. That may tell you something. People hate this thing so bad they are practicly giving it away!Apparently, someone at Nickelodeon decieded it was time to make a feature film. What a better way to start out than with a sure fire classic like ""harriet the spy""I remember the hype when this movie came out. I remember the numerous advertisements for it. But mostly, I remember going to see it and feeling like an idiot.What a great way to kick off your feature film market than to make a movie that completly sucked. Luckily, people knew a bad movie when they saw one, and this thing was forgotten almost instantly.(...)"
4,My grandchildren had me watching this....,Didn't think I would be interested but thoroughly enjoyed it. This is a great family movie and I loved the little twist at the end. Would watch again.
1,Poor quality,"It was out of the case was scrtched up and wouldn't play so it was useless, not sure would order again."
4,Harriet the Spy Review,"I was very happy with my order. My four year old granddaughter loves Harriet the spy and I bought this for her. You are the only one who had it in stock, your price was excellent, the video was of good quality and brand new in the box. I am very happy with my purchase, thank you."
3,"Cute movie, book is better","My daughter, who is 8, loves this movie. She also loves the book.I read the book when I was in the third or fourth grade (I'm 39 now) and it was one of my all-time favorites. Michelle Trachtenberg is not how I imagined Harriet, for sure, but she does a good job. I noticed that Asian and African-Americans were thrown into the cast randomly to make it more politically correct, and Harriet's writings were somewhat sanitized (she says some hilarious things in the book that did not appear in here.) While I like Rosie O'Donnell, she is miscast as Ole Golly.In short, if you are comparing it to the book, it comes up short.But if you're just looking for a cute movie for your kids to watch, you could do worse."
1,Louise Fitzhugh is spinning in her grave,"Readers who know the indomitable Harriet know she would never destroy her notebooks, no matter how distressed she was. Why Rosie O'Donnell in a part that should have been played by Chloris Leachman? Why is Mr Welsch portrayed as an ineffectual wimp and Mrs Welsch as a harridan? PC interracial casting inevitable but jarring (why not a black actress playing Harriet also?).Don't bother with this fluff. The real Harriet is in the books."
3,An insight to the mind of Piers Anthony,"OK, this is not the best Piers Anthony story in the world, It is reminiscent to the early pulp Science Fiction style (which I enjoy).However, there is a message in this book which will be found as a more subtle theme in many of his later books. A message of exploring the basis of reality and how our perception of that reality can shape exactly what we define as real.It is to me an exploration of the mind where Mr. Anthony takes a premise of ""what if"" and then creates a fictional world in which that premise is real and valid, then as the story develops we learn exactly how valid that premise really is.I recommend this to hard core fans of Piers Anthony who wish to beter understand him and his writing. You will find this theme again in the Tarot series played out in a much better format."
4,Good book,"This was the first of Anthony's books that I read. I found it to be interesting and give the push to read more of his books. It had a little of everything to it, the suspense, the romance, the adventure everything a Sci-Fi book should have."
4,Excellent! Just one tiny problem,"We love this -- we were gifted with a wonderful Brazilian hammock last Christmas and finally got around to ordering this in July. It is sturdy enough to support 450 pounds, which was one of the reasons we got this particular one. My only problem with it is that we can't seem to level the feet. Other than that, it's been great, no complaints at all. It has endured our extreme desert weather and provided excellent support for our hammock. I'm pretty sure the hammock will wear out before the stand does!"
5,Sturdy and easy assembly,The item is very sturdy and so easy to assemble and disassemble for storage. Perfect for anyone who needs a hammock stand.
4,"Good hammock stand, terrible packaging","The stand is sturdy and went together well. However, the box was falling apart when it arrived, and we are missing one bolt and the rubber end caps that must have fallen out in route. Surely they can afford some packing tape to hold the box closed."
4,"Great Stand, but Needs Extra Parts","This is a great hammock stand and is easy to assemble - tools free - but keep in mind that you will most likely need chains and extra 2 S-hooks to hang up the hammock. The box the stand arrives in shows chains, but they are not actually included. Ours cost about $30 extra dollars to be functional."
4,new programmer,"I feel this is a good book for a beginner programmer, one that is interested in having good examples, there is even a cgi programming chaper that is very useful. This is a good book for me, also, I have only used VBScript Programming before, well, also some BASIC in college... Perl seems great to me...bc"
4,"A Great Starter; two tiny problems, not insurmountable","This accessible and practical book can make a Non-Programmer into a Proud CGI Guru, given that the beginner understands some basic logical structures, and is willing to meet the authors halfway.PROBLEM 1: The book assumes a fairly extensive Unix background, so doesn't always explain itself where that's concerned. SOLUTION: Just ignore the bits that don't apply to you and keep going.PROBLEM 2: The first chapter can be intimidating. SOLUTION: Understand it to be an overview: ""Here's what you can do with perl."" Run its programs to see how they work, experiment with them, but don't freak out if you don't understand them completely. Alternately, just skip on to Chapter 2.We enjoyed Learning Perl, and found it a good beginner's book for this language or for programming in general. The touches of humor could be annoying to some, but we thought they added readability and interest."
2,Keep looking,"I don't understand why people rave about this book. Whenever I try to use it as a reference, I end up even more confused then when I started out. I find that I can usually guess the answer to a problem or else just ""do it like they do it in C"" rather than trying to find a good example to follow in this book. For example, after reading the section on doing formatted printing statements using ""fprintf"" I was thoroughly confused. I tried using the function just like C does and it worked, but I would have spent days trying to figure out the syntax from this book's explaination. I don't know of a better book, but I would suggest you keep looking for something else."
3,Not for those new to programming,"While this may be an excellent primer for programmers who are new to Perl (I don't know), it's not the best place to start for those who are entirely new to programming, like me. This book assumes you have some familiarity with programming. I found the Visual Quickstart guide much easier to pick up from scratch."
1,Save your money,"This book is typical of O'Reilly books, in that in the first chapter, they attempt to summarize the entire book. For a non-Perl programmer, attempting to learn the language, it will leave you frustrated and confused. The book is poorly organized, poorly written, and the author tends to ramble when he should be quantifying examples he's given. There are clearly better books available for learning Perl, and your money is better spent elsewhere."
4,Bought it to stop the questions,I picked this one up for a friend in an attempt to get him to stop bombarding me with perl questions. It didn't work. He just asked me more.
3,"A start point, but only a start point","It's a good book for beginners. However, it covers too little of perl, not even references and modules. On the other hand, it says more about the interactions between Perl and other stuff, e.g., files, directories, processes, CGI... which is eonderful and absent from Programming Perl.In a word, Learning Perl is a good start point for Perl programmers. But if you want to go a little further, buy a more serious one, such as Programming Perl."
3,Definitely a Good Value,"The book was thorough and detailed as are most of the O'Reilly series. However, for the perl beginner, I was confused at time by the syntax, and after re-reading some sections a few times, I was still a bit unclear on some issues. Consequently, this book was a great starting point to search other sources for assistance... usually online or other free sources. The code is presented and usually explained, but often times not completely. With the ""Programming Perl"" book by O'Reilly publisher, to accompany this book, learning perl would become much more easier. Alone, this book is decent."
5,A very good introduction,"As a dinosaur who hasn't programmed since the Fortran days of the '70's, I fail to understand the comments below criticising the book's accessibility, and especially the first chapter.I found the book to be one of the best introductions to a programming language I have ever read. I especially liked the first chapter that took you line by line through the construction of a sample program. Each concept was carefully explained in the context of those that went before. It doesn't get better than that."
4,"Yes; typos are a drag, but...","Yes; the typos are a drag but this is an impingement upon the editors and publisher rather than the authors. This is the only aspect keeping me from giving this one 5 stars. O'Reilly needs to quit resting on their laurels and get their part of the job done.As far as the text goes, the authors' approach is excellent. I have no previous experience with Perl and minimal with Unix, yet am able to follow along comfortably. Criticisms of the examples as being ""egotistical"" must stem from narrow minds unable to see the forest through the trees as they do their job of illustrating the concepts exceptionally well.To summarize, I really like this book. And now I must get back to reading it;-]"
4,good reference and teaching manual,"this book is a good introductory book into perl but cannot serve as the end all be all book for your learning purposes...it is highly suggested that you buy programming perl along with it to use as your reference manual as you go along, because if you learn anything about perl and ever actually use it then you will be buying this book eventually anyways."
3,Not for the Beginning Programmer,"I'm a beginning programmer and find this book to be aimed at those with programming experience. I am required to continue with this book as it is being used as a textbook for my class, but I'm sure there are better books out there for beginners.Features I don't like, for example, are: 1.) The first chapter is a book overview as to what will be covered within the book, but it's so intense that you have to use other books to understand what's happening unless you have previous programming experience; 2.) Explaining Perl terms with C language terms, which is only usefully if you know C; 3.) Examples suddenly adding or taking away parenthesis without an explanation as to why; 4.) Giving an example of a while statement with braces, but not explaining what's really happening within those braces and why.This may very well be an excellent book for the ordained programmer, but if your just starting out I'd do some more searching."
4,"With O'Reilly, you can't go wrong","I bought this book because I needed to learn PERL for CGI work I was doing. This book gave me a GREAT basis for PERL, and also helped me to decipher other PERL scripts that other people wrote. Modifiying these existing scripts is no problem after learning the basic concepts presented in this book. This book does not go too in depth with every in and out of the PERL language, but its not meant to do that... To sum it up.. if you need to start leaning PERL.. this is a very good book to get."
3,Great Book. Good for beginners.,I like the book a lot. I am reading it right now. The thing about the book is it's program codes. I usually figure out how to program by viewing code and using man pages to figure out what the function does. So books with words don't help out that much and books with examples do. If you are someone who can look at something and find the meaning then this is a great book. It's a also a good book for people who will read but that takes longer :-) My only problem is that I wished the book would go a little more in depth to at least intermediate level and call that beginner level and use more examples (code).
2,Not for Beginners,"As a self taught beginner programmer, I discovered perl to be the easiest language to learn. Unfornately, this book is not really for beginners. Although, the examples seem to start out easy, assumptions are made at your cost as you become slightly confused and come to a dead stop in understanding. This book is great for someone who already knows a programming language for it gets them on track quickly. I've already found a better book for beginner's that contrast this one a lot more than I expected."
5,"Good Book, but somewhat hard to grasp.","This is a really good book, of course, i dont except anything less because it's a O'reilly book! The only that is difficult is learning it at first. If you dont already know the basic syntax then it is really tough to understand. Once you get the hang of it, you can't put it down!!!"
4,educating,"This book is not for a beginner to programming, you may want a c/C++ background, it covers Perl, ON A UNIX SYSTEM, gives good introductions, and takes a while to read, you should spend at least 1-2 hours on each chapter. lots of working examples."
4,Easy to understand,"This book is well written and provides enough examples to get you going. The language is matter-of-fact and explains the basic concepts well. I recommend this book, if you are a beginner. I've been hacking at perl for almost 2 years before I got this book. It has concepts which are still useful and practical."
5,The definitive guide to learning perl,"If you want to learn Perl but don't want to wade through 600+ pages of the unfocused meandering you tend to find in most ""Learn [insert Internet skill here]"" books these days, this is the first book you should buy. (Followed by Programming Perl and The CGI/Perl Cookbook [cgi-perl.com] if you'll be doing CGI programming.) This book covers everything you need to know and does so in a concise way that won't waste your time or treat you like an idiot. It's no suprise that this is the only introductory Perl book that appears on everyone's bestseller lists."
5,This book saved my life,"I was recently given a large task to complete in a short ammount of time. I had never programed before and was terrified at the thought of my first project being one of such a huge magnitude. However, since I had this book available, I was able to get a quick grasp of the basics and then, with the help of Mr. Schwartz and some source code that I got from a friend, I was able to put together a fully functional web based application that joined the WWW and an Oracle database. Without this book, I would have been lost in a sea of ignorance. Anyone who needs to learn Perl should giver serious consideration to this one. It just may save your life."
1,Only for absolute starters in programming,"Don't know about beginners, but for the experienced programmer who wants to learn perl, this book is a waste of time and money. It teaches far too little on too many pages. You'll read it once (diagonally as we say in german) and then never again. Get the reference and the Perl Cookbook instead and you'll be far better off."
2,an excellent approach to a technical subject,"when i picked up this book i didn't know any ""real"" programming languages - heck, i didn't even know how to write a shell script! in two months this book gave me the knowledge to create applications and report generators for my employer, quickly earning me a promotion.it's real easy to gain practical knowledge from this introduction to perl due to the effective layout. some of the subjects aren't covered in very much detail, but the reader is always given sources for additional (free) information.reading some of the silly commentaries posted here; if you cannot grasp what this book hands you, perhaps you should make the move to customer support or marketing and leave programming to the cognitive specimens."
2,Not for beginners,"I picked up this book the same time I started a beginning Unix class. I'm mainly a windows person, but want to broaden my skills into the Unix world, also the class was going so slow, I figured I could teach myself perl in my spare time. Wrong.I have had programming classes before, in Basic, Fortran, Pascal, and Cobol. With this book, by page 13 he was covering arrays, hashes, and other terms I just didn't quite get. I can follow the examples in the book, but I'm wondering why the syntax is so funky.I put the book down, and picked it up again after finishing my Unix class. The terms make much more sense now after being exposed to regular expressions, grep, sed, awk, etc. I'm going to give it a second try, but I dont' think I'm really going to learn this well outside of a classroom."
1,Horrible book for beginners,This book is NOT for beginning programmers. We are using this book in a Summer School 6 week session and everyone at this point (week 3) : scrambling to come up with alternatives. This book: NOT ENOUGH EXAMPLES IN BOOK. ASSUMES PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE. We've already lost 50% of class due to dropouts from being completely confused!
2,This needs to be a better book,"I have learned many languages in my computer career. I am 17 and I have learned approx. 6 languages excluding the English and French :) In all my book reading days, I have never seen a worse book than this one. It has a lot of useful information except that some people are just starting in UNIX programming. This book jumps right into the harder languages instead of actually touching base with each command. I really wish that SAMS would write a book for Perl because I really like their books"
4,18 of 19 Chapters Great,"Most of the book flows: smooth, logical, heuristic. A very good introduction to what can be a confusing language. Best book I've seen for a programmer to use to pick up a new language. You will want the companion camel book, Programming Perl, for reference; but don't try to learn Perl from the camel book unless you are a masochist.Two free bits of advice. Skip the first chapter. If you want to learn Perl, you know why. There is enough stuff in the first chapter to stifle the impulse if you read it carefully.Second, practice your skimming skills on the second chapter. Then go back and re-read it carefully when you're fresh. It's long and important, but when you've got past this chapter, you'll roll the rest of the way through the book."
4,"the ""official"" perl book","This book, along with ""Perl Cookbook"" are considered the official resources for Perl information. Although this book is not the best choice for the first time programmer. It does explain things somewhat clearly, they are written from a somewhat technical perspective. And any type of crossover information is not explain so you MUST read each chapter clearly before going to the next one. But if you already know some programming then this book will make sense. I;m not bashing the book, as you can see I gave it 4 stars, I'm just presenting the way the book is."
5,"Good start for the language, catch up in a short time.","I read this book as I have no previous experience in script, eventhough I know pretty well c, c++. This book is not down to earth like the 21 days book, but not advance either. However, if you keep patience and practice, it will introduce you the language in less than 7 days. Good place to start:) The 21 days book will make you nervous by so many unnecessary details and it doesn't go deep. It has gone through most the basic features of the language like matching pattern, data type, control flow... This is a very good for the beginner who want to learn the language in a short time. It doesn't explain well cgi, and missing oop. But it is a book for the beginner, don't expect everything. The next will be the advanced Perl."
2,Why can't programmers write?,"The language, PERL, is hideously syntactically challenged. This book doesn't shed one ray of light on the language."
2,Aaaarrrgggghhhhh!,"My main problem with this book is as follows: There are exercises at the end of each chapter that are oftentimes impossible to answer given the information presented to that point. For example, at the end of chapter 7, one exercise requires the use of an operator (&&) that is not even explained until chapter 9. I spent an entire day beating my head against this problem, only to give up and find out that I shouldn't have even known the answer to begin with! How frustrating!"
2,Makes learning this bizarre language even more difficult,"I'm one of the people who doesn't ""get"" perl. I don't understand the need, the hype or the reason for the inscrutable code. True, the infamous Chapter One is bad enough, as is the lame humor and ego-driven silliness of these sample programs. But I'm skeptical enough (even of my own skepticism) to keep an open mind on these matters. What I was left wondering as I read through this is, why do we need to go through this? What is it that we can't provision with existing tools? What is beneficial about having many ways to do simple things, which only leads to more confusion? Perl code is not easy to read, easy to maintain, nor easy to learn. It all looks a like a regular expression that ate too much spaghetti. Give me a carefully structured language like C, C++ or Java any day. For Unix needs, Bash shell scripts, sed and awk are just fine. Perl is a mess, and this book doesn't make it any clearer."
1,Awful,"I see a disturbing ternd by O'Reily of pumping out books that are not well done. I consider this a terrible book. Its poorly organized, skips over many important topics, and among the worst books on Perl Ive seen. My gut impression was it took them about a month to write it, just a rush job rip off of programming Perl.A beginner should avoid this book. Learn Perl from another book and use Programming Perl as a reference. The Cookbook is good too.Avoid this book, its a waste of money. Its the worst languages book Ive seen in a while."
2,This is for people who have NEVER written code,"I followed the advice from other reviews and bought the book since I am completely new to Perl. The foreword and the odd attempt at humor are terrible, but that is a small detail. What really bugged me is that the author spends so much time on the simplest stuff. You learn that functions that take arguments can do more interesting stuff than functions with no arguments, and you learn what if/else is about. Wow! For anybody who can understand the following:while (i-->0) array[i] = 1;this book is a waste of time. I did learn about Perl, but it could all have been summed up in 30 pages, not 200+. If you have programmed in C before, go for ""Programming Perl"" instead."
5,Excellent book for beginners of PERL with C/C++ experience.,"This book is awesome. It explains the concepts at the perfect pace for the intermediate programmer. I have only read this book for 1 day so far, but the first 'intro' chapter has already walked me through concepts such as Hash tables, arrays, and all the loops and many string functions. This book is excellent and makes PERL easy to learn if you have already done C or C++. If you are an absolute beginner (never programmed before), this will not be easy to follow. I suggest learning C or C++ first, as it is the building block of many languages and has similar commands."
2,Too Small,"Bought these for my girl friend's dachshund and it lasted 10 minutes, the squeaker quit working , and then he lost interest in it , We haven't tried another one, ( they come six to a pack), but not expecting the results to change !! These are not worth the price !!"
2,Cheap,"These are my little Westie's favorite toys. She has been playing with them for years. Well about two years ago we could no longer find them in the pet store, so I went on line. Found your site and ordered 10 bags so we would never run out again. Problem with your product is that it is made with much cheaper products than the ones we used to get. With your toy the squeaker is broken in less than a minute. Sooooooooooooooo disappointing for my dog and myself. She loves to play music for us with her toys and with yours the squeaker is dead before she even gets to start playing. I will continue to order the toys for her as she knows the name of each one and adores them so, but I am also going to work hard at finding her something else of better quality to play with."
2,nice and small for litte dogs,My chihuahua bit all the eyes and ends off. Disappointed they didn't hold up better.
5,LOVE this song!!!,"I just heard this song two weeks ago for the first time, but I am already obsessed with it! It's a great song, and (though I'm in NH, not LA) it really gets across that feeling that you HAVE to leave, but when you finally do you want back. Great vocals too."
3,+ 1/2 stars...Mostly Recycled Steamroller,"The Mannheim Steamroller juggernaut seems to be running out of steam. Instead of a new album of all new material, Chip Davis cobbles together this album of tracks dating all the way back to 1975's Fresh Aire I through 2000's Fresh Aire 8 with a handful of new tracks thrown in for good measure. And the new tracks are not what's best about this album. ""Love Theme from 'Romeo & Juliet'"" certainly fits the romantic theme and is up to Steamroller standards, but ""Love Is Blue"" is slowed down to almost a funeral dirge pace. Altogether, this album will certainly set the mood for a romantic evening; but if you're a serious Steamroller fan, there's not that much new here to justify purchase."
5,So great to listen too after a long day.,The music on this cd is great. I listen to it when my husband is watching his games.
2,CDs worked!,"CDs arrived promptly, but cases were smashed in box. Luckily, the CDs were not damaged and i could replace the cases"
4,"A Peanuts Christmas, cartoons selected by somebody","This is definitely not the Hallmark book which seems to be offered in the marketplace end of the Amazon sales!! This is a nice collection, but not a great collection. Many strips were dropped from the continuity. At least three strips were printed twice, indicating either the editor was asleep or there was no editor! We can only wait for a collection of full continuity strips, but, until then, this is still a worthwhile purchase for Peanuts fans young and old. If you already have the Hallmark collection, buy this also. If not, forget that edition."
4,"very good, but could have been better","This Peanuts hardcover is definitely recommended. However, it could have been more comprehensive, especially considering previous Peanuts Christmas-themed volumes. A decent preface should have been included-- and many, many more Christmas strips could/should have been included."
2,Great toy - horrible battery life,"The toy is just like the one I remember as a kid, with one exception. The batteries (6 AA) only last for 20 minutes before they are spent. When you remove the batteries, they are hot from being depleted so fast. Major design flaw. Only buy if you are willing to repace the batteries every time your child plays with it."
3,Fun but not very durable,"The initial excitement of flying this little helicopter wore off after the first couple of days when it became somewhat boring. After all, all you can do is go around in a little circle. Oh, you can go backwards too and stop to pick things up, but basically it is like riding a pony around on an exercise wheel...not too exciting. I would say it is a good practice toy for stepping up to something like the Havoc Heli by Air Hogs, but our boys tired of it very quickly. In addition, the toy is not very durable and is awkward to store. The top of the helicopter where the arm attaches to the aircraft snapped after just a few days, and it's almost impossible to use (and impossible to glue) in that condition."
1,WASP rules but don't buy this album!,"The music is great but the recording quality sucks. Very disappointed, some bootlegs are better!"
4,Cute shoes,"I got them in navy and amber tan. They are really cute and comfy, but you kind of have to wear them a couple times before they are comfy, break them in.(that's why i give them 4 stars) They are true to size."
2,Not comfortable,I love clarks shoes but this one does not fit clarks usual comfort shoes. The length is okie. But the leather really hurts your feet. I tried to walk on it for 20 minutes and my feet couldn't bear the pain it causes. I wouldn't recommend this shoe.
2,Clark's Womens Starbrite Mary Jane flats,"I have been addicted to Clark's shoes from my first pair; however, this pair does not show clearly that it is suede and leather - and it does not have the good fit of other Clark's. The length is correct but the upper outsides seem to almost flare out (does not have a close fit) - and the top leather seems to show an inside color (almost whiteish) of the leather. I would not have bought this shoe had I been in a store and tried it on.Mayetta Wilson212 W SunsetNashville, AR 71952"
4,If you can disregard mediocre sound quality - go for it!,"This record is historical. It was originally released as ""Softly as in the morning sunrise"" by some other lable. Dolphy is accompanied here by McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman and unexpectedly fitting Mel Lewis (one would expect Elwin Jones in his place, but in a less melodic/more supporting/metric way he managed to complement the group). The quality of sound on this re-issue is definitely better that on the German original, but still far from being perfect. In other words, if you can sacrifice the sonic quality of recording and appreciate superb musicianship of the session, than go ahead, since the versions of the ""Green Dolphin Street"" and ""Softly as in the Morning Sunrise"" are among the very best ever recorded by Dolphy.It seems that Japanese company did their best, but you can not go far if quality of the master is not good."
1,Not Fudgie OR Tasty,"I've done a fair amount of sugar-free, low carb eating so know that decent taste is obtainable with these products. But do not expect it from Golightly Fudgie Rolls. They are truly bad tasting, even when you are really hungry."
1,Will the real LFO please stand up........,"I forgot all about this 'group' till i was searching limewire for the *Real* LFO (Low Frequency Oscillation), a british techno group. I got sick a little when i carelessly downloaded and played summer girls and a few other lyte funky songs,... what the.. what does lyte funky ones mean??I didnt like when i heard their song(s) played on the radio, and i still feel that way about them... lyrics that make no sense what so ever... and an acronym band name that was already taken...Imposters!"
2,Lyric copycat,"I think LFO should focus more on their rapping cause that's what they do best. Also, the 8th track on the album-""I'll show you mine"", the lyric is exactly the same as another song called ""I see you"" which is sung by a Australian singer named Peter Andre. I think it's pretty low for a talented group like LFO to copy a foreign singer's lyrics in hoping that noboby would ever find out. Overall, it is an okay album if they don't sing those stupid songs such as ""Summer girls"" and ""girl on tv""."
1,LFO,"I recently ordered this CD for my 9-year-old son who likes ""Summer Girls."" This site recommends the CD for ages 9-12. I listened to it entirely for content when I received it and was disappointed. The lyrics in ""I will show you mine"" tells of a guy realizing his fantasy of undressing with a girl and having her say ""I will show you mine, if you show me yours"" and being naked with each other. While this would normally not even warrant a double take, the idea of my 9-year-old son, who is just becoming interested in girls, listening to some ""cool guys"" sing about this hits me the wrong way. If not for the one song's lyrics I would have recommended this CD highly. However, I can't recommend it for ages 9-12. I now have to find another gift for my son and hope I can return the CD..."
1,HORRIBLE CD!,"I just got the cd,and listened 2 it.IT WAS HORRIBLE.All they are,are white rappers, (a.k.a POSERS)Rich thinks he's blck,but da lyrics is WACK!!I thought the cd would be tight,but I WAS WRONG!DEVON CANNOT SING!Whoeva gave da boy 10 solos needs 2 be dragged into the street,shot and killed,and SO DOES DEVON!(DON'T BUT THIS CD)!!!THE lyrics have NO meanin,and ""girl on tv"",was nothin but a rip of TQ'S ""WESTSIDE"",and their song""westside"",was also a rip of tq's""westside"",and what do they know about WESTSIDE ANYWAYZ (TV?)"
1,NKOTB had a bunch of hits - listening to LFO makes me sick,"Hooray for the boys at LFO. They can actually write their own songs. Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell them that songwriting involves more that just taking a rhyming dictionary and combining random phrases. No, I'm not just talking about about ""summertime girls,"" although that is certainly one of the more outrageous examples (and I wouldn't be surprised if they chose to promote Abercrombie and Fitch, simply because it rhymes with the name of the singer). These guys just don't have much talent, either lyrically or vocally. In all honesty, this is probably one of the sorriest that I have ever heard. Simply pathetic..."
1,"""Summer Girls"" is so meaningless, it's unreal.","I've sampled the selection ""Summer Girls,"" and I wasn't impressed: the lyrics, penned by them, sound rather silly. New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits, Chinese food makes me sick, William Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets, Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton, Scooby Snacks, Paul Revere, Macaulay Culkin, Abercrombie & Fitch, what kind of s**t is THAT? Well, LFO, if Chinese food really made you sick, how come you have to keep saying it three billion times during the course of the song? I LOVE Chinese food, anyway. And another thing: WHAT THE HELL IS MAURO MALAVASI DOING ON HERE? Relax, he let these guys use a piece of one of his songs on this album. He's Andrea Bocelli's producer. Try putting Bocelli's name in one of your songs on your next album, we'll see who laughs last then."
2,A disapointment,"Well, i bought this CD because i liked their first single, ""Summer Girls"". But unfortunately, i was sorely disapointed. ""Summer Girls"", i thought, was gonna be kind of like the preveiw of the pace of this CD, but no, the rest of the songs are slow, monotonous, and boring. Yes their are some exceptions, like ""West Side Story"" and ""Girl on TV"" but i wish i would have gotten the singles."
4,Light-hearted summer fun,"LFO is one of those boy bands you can't help but like, whether it's because their name stands for 'light funky ones,"" or because of their ludicrous lyrics on their first single Summer Girls. If you're looking for an album full of deep, reflective songs, this is probably not your cup of tea, but otherwise there's something on here for everyone. They have sincere, if unoriginal, ballads like Your Heart is Safe With Me, upbeat pop treats like Westside Story, and pretty mid-tempos like Think About you. The only song I didn't like was I Will Show You Mine, an unnecessarily sexual tune. Overall though, this is one to play at parties or just to chill to."
4,Well worth it...,"I know that many are saying that ""Summer Girls"" makes no sense, but if you think about it, the song makes you remember the things that they are rhyming about. The song is about having fun. Even if it doesn't make sense to some, it makes you remember ""the good old days."" The other songs mainly include beautiful slow songs. They are really sweet, and guess what? They make sense!"
4,4 Stars,"To give credit where it's due, the Boston trio known as LFO was responsible for much of the writing and production on their debut album. Their voices are almost as good as the Backstreet Boys, much better when they're singing choruses together than when they stretch out on solo spots. And those choruses are quite catchy on the single ""Summer Girls,"" ""Girl on TV,"" and several other tracks."
2,It's just OK,"I have to agree the song Summer Girls didn't make much sense and the lyrics weren't the greatest. I find myself singing the song and some of the guys are pretty cute, but I probably wouldn't buy the cd."
3,I can't figure out why I like it.,"""Summer Girls"" is an absolutely retarded song. The lyrics make no sense (""New Kids on the block had a buncha hits, Chinese food makes me sick""?!?) and the group can't really sing, so why do I find myself humming it all the time?!? Ok, I'll admit it, I like the song, but I don't know why! It has nothing that good music should have!!"
1,Dont Waste Your time,This cd is horrible and summer girls is the stupidest song i have ever heard. It seems like they got a dictionary and put a bunch of words to paper then started making up a no sense song. If your going to write a song. Make it mean something. Dont be stupid and write meaningless songs like summer girls or i want it that way. And if your smart dont buy this cd.
5,LFO IS A GREAT ALBUM,"I first saw LFO on TRL with their video ""Summer Girls"" and I got to like it. Its a great song. My best friend likes it to and we both bought their album last Tuesday when it came out and we didn't even know their other songs but we both like their other songs. LFO is a great between R&B and rap. So I suggest you go buy their album. Trust Me you'll be glad you did. Its worth your money"
1,Don't jump on the bandwagon,"This is an album of total unoriginality. Show me an LFO in 5 years and I'll show you a ""band"" that hasn't released a second album. I hate this ""music"" so much. Save the billboard charts for people who can actually sing, write songs, and play their own instruments."
3,Guys.......relax.,"I must admit that this isn't the best CD I've ever heard, but come on guys, sometimes you just have to know what to expect. I would think that after hearing ""Summer Girls"" on the radio, you all would kind of get a feel for what type of group LFO is. Obviously their CD isn't going to be the best collection of music ever made, that much I know for sure, but it may still be a collection of catchy fun tunes that keep ya singing all day long. And that is exactly what it is. And also,Do you think the lyrics for ""Summer Girls"" are really the best they can do? Probably not people, probably not. It seems to me that they wrote it almost as a joke, just to be a fun little song that would possibly get some publicity. And it did. So before you go off bashing this CD, just realize that it was probably intended to be the way it was, and yes, they probably can do better, but maybe they CHOSE not to, and to instead produce a fun little CD that could be enjoyed by everyone."
1,American pop culture is deteriorating rapidly.,"After all these years, I think I now understand what the blanket label ""Alternative"" really means... it's a throwback to a time when people put emotion, grit, and thought into their music. The face of pop music these days is one of homogonization. I have no clue how people differentiate between NSync, BSB, or now LFO. The lyrics are trite, the harmonies are elementary, and the music is interchangeable from one group to the other. LFO is particularly troublesome because they actually work ""Abercrombie & Fitch"" into their lyrics... wake up people.. this is marketing caca, not music. These are bands made up of people capitalizing on their looks, not their talent... and if I were a teenage girl, I'd be insulted that the record labels would think I'm stupid enough not to be able to tell the difference."
2,"LFO: Lurid, Filthy, Oppressive","In the subgenre of boy bands, which is not one of music's more well-appreciated genres to begin with, LFO stands as one of the least talented. They aren't the greatest singers, some of the lyrics are among the cheesiest boy-band lyrics ever, and the rapping on many of the songs on this album is simply pathetic. The only reason that it gets 2 stars is because ""All I Need To Know"" is, if nothing else, a hummable, melodic song that you can try closing your eyes to and pretending that it's somebody else."
1,What in the blazes!?,"This is without a doubt the worst album of 1999, and quite possibly the worst album of the whole decade. Why anyone would want to buy a record of a group with a name like ""Lyte Funky Ones"" is beyond me! They sure are funky, as in they really stink."
1,THE WORST SONG EVER WRITTEN,"Summer Girls is everything that is wrong with music today. It is style over substance. The words make no sense what so ever, but that doesn't matter because the guys singing are cute (sentence must be read with high levels of sarcasim). What ever happened to songs that spoke to people? Instead of Bob Dylan singing about social injustices we have LFO singing about how Chinese Food makes them sick.If you are a music fan, please avoid this band at all costs."
4,it was different from other groups,I thought this cd was really cool. It isn't like the backstreet boys or n sync so it is unquie.
3,summer girls is good,summer girls is an excellent song but after the first 3 songs the album goes from good music to bad.don't go out of your way to buy this CD but if you can spear the money buy it
3,LFO is cool,"I haven't heard all the songs, but I really like Summer Girls and Girl On T.V. I know alot of people say ""you've heard one boy band, you've heard them all"" but it's not true! Why does it seem so many people are down on so-called boy bands? You don't hear me dissing heavy metal, and rock and roll, even though I can't stand the stuff. And every boy band IS different, even if they have the same manager. They have different songs, and even though N'Sync copies BSB, they do a poor job of it. And honestly, who cares if they are all the same? No one is forcing you to listen to them, if you hear them, change the radio station or t.v or WHATEVER. We who like so-called boy bands are happy, and that's all that matters."
1,Copycats,"LFO's debut album follows in the steps of many bands. A poppy sound, good looking guys and the latest styles. Unfortunately this is a formula that has been well run over and continues to be beaten to death. Lyrics make no sense. On the debut single ""Summer Girls"" emphasis is given only to rhyming. The rhyming schemes used in this song just rhyme and thats it. The song make's very little sense and further drives the point home that quality boy bands are no longer being put out. Just copycat posers trying to sell records."
2,Disappointing,"This album was very disappointing. I expected better after ""Girl on tv"". There are a few good songs, but not many. I reccomend Backstreet Boys over LFO."
1,What Has This World Come To Since 1999?,"Let's skip to the main poimt. LFO really, really, sucks. And that's a fact to most people. ''Summer Girls'' was plain gay, I mean, like, really. WHO SINGS ABOUT CHINESE GIRLS?!! LFO is a gay name, too. Lyte Funky Ones?! WHAT IN THE NAME OF HOLY COW DOES ''LYTE FUNKY ONES'' MEAN????? I Think they have like, dylexia or somthin', 'cause they sure are not rapper, nor good spellers!Overall- F is not even bad ENOUGH!"
4,THE HOTTEST BAND EVER!!!,Their songs were alright!! but THEY ARE SO GORGEOUS!!!I HAD A HUGE CRUSH THESE GUYS!! HOW IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES!!R.I.P RICH CRONIN!!! WOW I WAS LOOKING AT THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS THAT IS LEFT ON AMAZON FOR LFO.. ALL THE GUYS THAT TALK TRASH ABOUT THEM ARE JUST JEALOUS!!!
2,too much boy bands nowadays,"When I first heard ""Summer Girls"" I hated it. But then, since it got so much airplay on the radio the song gradually grew on me. Unfortunately for the rest of the cd, I have to say that LFO is just another one-hit wonder. I don't think they could compete with NSYNC,98*, or BSB. There can only be sooo many boybands in the world.. it's overwhelming! The guys are goodlooking but that's about it. Sorry."
5,Lfo is awesome,I love this cd. Anyone who doesn't has nooooo taste in music. The boys are just jealous of LFO's looks. They are H-O-T-T hot! They are Cutie Putties. Especially Rich.
1,Are you crazy,"I've been reading some of the earlier reviews on this site, and I cannot believe that people actually like this cd. I've liked hip hop for a long time. Heck, I even like some of the boy bands. But this cd has to be one of the worst that I've ever heard. Seriously. I wouldn't be surprised if the band were the only ones to write the positive reviews on here. Do yourself a favor and forget about LFO. (PS. they act like complete in their Summer Girls video.)"
5,This CD is the best!!!,"I love this CD. LFO is so cool and I really like ""Summer Girls"". The other songs are really good also! BUY THIS CD!!!"
1,Abercrombie and Fitch?,"Good lord, ""Summer Girls"" has to have the worst lyrics to a song i have ever heard. Could we please start making sense? I hope i never hear that song again."
1,"As Marvin Gaye Would Put, ""What's Going On?""","This stuff reeks. I heard Summer Girls on the radio, and immediately turned the knob to another station. My little sister just bought their cd, and she's playing it real loud as I write this. I can tell you this: Even the Monkees would challenge their dedication, and even Kyle and Lyle from Ishtar would make fun of these guys' lyrics. To any girl over ten listening to this music: GROW UP AND GET A LIFE! Buy some real music, like Jawbox or Underworld. Anyway, I'm Audi!"
4,Pretty phat!,"I'm I die-hard Backstreet Boys fan, and I usually scream and switch the radio station-or T.V. faster than lightning whenever another boyband such as sorry wannabes-otherwise known as *NSYNC (Or where ever the little * goes!) come on. However, this is not true with L.F.O. I looove Girl on T.V. (shooby-do-wop and scooby snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax.) They have a lot of talent and I enjoy listening to their music. (Even though I'll always love the BSB the best.) So get the C.D. I don't think you'll be dissapointed. Unless you love hard rock bands like Korn. Which you probably don't if you're considering buying this C.D. Anyway, I highly reccommend this C.D. If you're still not sure about this buy, listen to the samples. That helps a lot! Peace out."
1,THE WORST SINGLE ENTITY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD,"This garbage is just so bad that it really transcends music. I've had trouble thinking of anything that just made such a mockery out of its feld as LFO does to music. In 20 years, society is going to look back on this joke and shake their heads in shame. We have reached the low point in the history of music."
5,The Hottest group for the new millenium!,The totally awsome sounds of this rockin group make everyone want to get up and DANCE! Their music can make a gloomy day seem like one of the best you've ever had! If you love jammin groups with jammin tunes along with three buff cuties than this album is deffinetially for you!
1,THIS IS VERY SAD,"First of all, Amazon really needs to add 0 stars as an option. Now, I am really starting to get concerned that the world may actually be getting ready to end since this group is supposed to be a hit. This cd is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever heard. The lyrics make absolutely no sense plus these guys have NO talent and can't sing at all. Every song I have heard on the radio by this group makes me sick because it so pointless. These guys are supposedly singing about a girl but they are talking about Chinese food making them sick? What the hell does that have to do with anything? For the love of God, why do some people support this? This is HORRIBLE! PLEASE STOP SUPPORTING THIS STUFF SO IT WILL GO AWAY! IF THIS MUSIC IS ACCEPTED AND SUPPORTED, EVEN WORSE MUSIC WILL BE RELEASED!"
5,VERY COOL!,"This CD is sooooooo cool! I don't usually listen to this kind of music, but i really liked this!"
3,Lfo? Lame for OVERHYPED Cd's,"I don't think this CD is all that, or a bag of chips. I really love ""Summer Girls"" and I was hoping the rest of the CD would be as up-beat and well written, but it wasn't. If you, like me, love the crazy lyrics of ""Summer Girls"" this CD will be a let-down. The rest of those songs are sappy songs that sound like they were written by the same guy who writes songs for 'N Sync and teh Backstreet Boys. I alwasy thought LFO was different because they wrote in a style all their own, but I was wrong. They've become just anothr sell out."
2,Not all that bad.,"I saw your video for Summer Girls. I personally think the song has no meaning whatsoever, but when I listened to other songs, I reconsidered. But um, one question: Why'd you guys go and get all carried away with Abercrombie and Fitch?"
1,NOT ANOTHER %#$@ BOY BAND!!!!,"The first time I heard this song, I thought it was a jingle, one that would take a person only 5 minutes to write. When I found out it was a real song I almost fell over. I really pity the members of LFO if this is the only type of material that they can write. I do give them one star though because at least they did write their own song, unlike the backstreet boys & 'n-sync."
5,GREAT!,i luv this cd its so good i luv it i luv number 8 its a good song but has weird lyrics but i like girl on tv the best its the coolest ok bye!
4,that is a good cd with great songs,summer girls is great. my sister and aunt love this song and we sing all the words
5,number 1 fan,"LFO are the BOMBWhen I met you I said my name was Rich, you look like a girl from Abercrombie & Finch. New kids on the block got a bunch of hits Chinese food makes me sick, but I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer, for the summer"
5,Great Unique new group!,"I can't believe that some people don't like LFO!! How can you not! They're unique, talented, gorgeous!! I would encourage anyone and everyone to buy the cd, It rules!!"
1,What is this supposed to be?,"I just listened to LFO and I can't seem to stop jamming rusty nails in my ears. To give them some credit, they did use an interesting strategy in coming up with the music and lyrics for this CD. First, they got a chimpanzee drunk and gave him a pencil, and two hours later they had the lyrics to ""Summer Girls."" Then, they snuck into the recording sessions of other popular boy bands and went through the garbage, knowing they'd find a few gems in the ""lyrics we threw away because they were too trite and cliche even for an uninspired boy band"" pile. With all the lyrics for their CD finished, it was then just a matter of laying the tracks down. They used MTV Music Generator 2.0 to produce their baselines, then had Vanilla Ice come in and figure out the rhythm for their rapping. The result is this classic, one-of-a-kind reminder of why nobody should ever buy Abercrombie and Fitch."
5,"Great, I loved it!","It was a great CD and if you like the song ""Summer Girls"" you'll like most of the songs on the CD. My Favorite songs on it are ""Summer Girls"", ""Girl on Tv"" and ""West Side Story."" This is a great CD and I suggest you buy it."
4,Dang.,Dang. Ya'll people are so different. Ya'll got some people who love it and some who are mean and say it is they worst thing they ever heard. Dang.
1,boring cd,I do not like you guys i never heard your cd but its boring anyways i hate you all italian food makes me sick
1,i can't stand the LYTE FUNKIE ONES!,"i hate l.f.o.! they are so bad it makes me sick to see that they are making videos. they need to give up this career because they are terrible. they could not be worse wannabes if they tried.they are all terribly unattractive and i hate it when i see their videoes and those terrible bodies of theirs. their singings careers are gonna go down faster than the titanic and i await that day with anticipation. i am sorry to those of you who do not share my opinion, but trust me, you soon will. they are the spice girls of 1999 and no one will remember them in a month."
4,Eyes on the Prize II,"Eyes on the Prize II picks up where Eyes on the Prize I left off. It is a very interesting take on history. A must for anyone interested in the Civil Rights Movement, history in general or teachers."
5,No Other,"I got this as a birthday gift and was so excited I practically devoured it in two days, once I calm down I'll read it again a little more slowly and savor it. John Einarson handles his subject with sensitivity, compassion and intelligence, it's an honest and sympathetic portrayal that doesn't gloat over the salacious side of his story. I would recommend this to any fan of the Byrds or 60's music in general, but make sure you also go out and get some of Gene Clark's music too, it might help you forget about the tragic side. I have the Buffalo Springfield book by this author, and am looking forward to seeking out his other books too!!"
4,Great for Gene Clark fans,This detailed bigraphy of Gene Clark starts very slowly and is full of dry detail. Towards the end however it really gets much more evocative emotionally and overall is a must for his fans. I found it good to read other books crossing the same path eg Johnny Rogans Byrds Bio (and even Pam Des Barres for more insight into how Chris Hillman functioned).
4,A story that needs to be told,"Gene Clark was not only the genius behind the Byrds, notwithstanding Roger McGuinn's brilliance and David Crosby's backup roll, but a true pioneer of several variations of modern rock and popular music.The story of this troubled man is long overdue and one that I think today's fans of folk-rock, psychedelia, alt-country and Americana are largely unaware of.The book is long on facts and that is OK but the one quibble I have, and the reason I did not give 5 stars, is that the author tends to repeat himself rather than just tell a straightforward story.Otherwise the book is outstanding and has led me to look for more and more of Clark's work as I re-discover and discover this true innovator of American music."
4,MONO-nucleosis.,"This is a wonderfully-chosen double CD collection of the '60s singer-songwriter's oeuvre, providing a thorough overview of his career. But, be warned: Disc One is almost entirely in MONO, which is fine for engineers and other luddite aesthetes, but leaves some of us mere listeners cold. One should at least buy Donovan's Greatest Hits first, for the stereo mixes, and then get this new compilation. Nice booklet with this new compilation, though!"
2,"Buy ""Greatest Hits"" Instead","While it is incredibly good news that Donovan--who has always been under rated--is being included in the ""Essential"" series, the compilation itself is a disappointment. All of the tracks included here, and one other as well, can be found on the expanded version ofDonovan's Greatest Hitsreleased last year. The album notes and the sound quality on ""Greatest Hits"" are also superior. Unless you are a Donovan completist (and I admit that I am), I would strongly suggest ""Greatest Hits"" instead of ""The Essential."""
5,"Redundant, but Great","I do have this disc and I play it quite a bit, because of the excellent job Sony did remastering it. However since they'd already gone and remastered the ""Greatest Hits"" that came out on Epic all those years ago, plus added extra songs, there is really no reason to buy this disc, as good as it is, because the set list, though ordered differently (this disc has the songs ordered by when they were originally recorded) is exactly the same and you get one more song, the great ""Riki, Tiki, Tavi"" on the GH version. One does wonder, just how many ways can they repackage this man's stuff. Are the same people buying it over and over? However, the songs are outstanding, the recording is too, so five stars, even though it was redundant as soon as Sony put it out."
2,broke,"cheap bottle that broke after a few washes through the ol' dishwasher. Its really cheap, five more words for this review"
2,Does not seal well.,I bought 3 of these for powdered diet drinks and lunch shakes. It does not twist tight to fit and so does not seal well. I end up with drips all over and can't drink from it without a towel!
5,Shaker bottle,Very easy to use and clean. I take it to work filled with protein powder and just add water at work. Worth the price. No leaks noticed.
3,"A regular film, but better than I thought","I saw this movie today, and I was a little disapointed 'cause the critics of this film were really bad and i really wanted to see it.But, i was surprised.I'm not saying this movie is bad, but it's just another slasher film, like Valentina or Urban Lyends: Final cut.But this one it's better than i thought.Why?Well, first it has really great moments and really scarry deads.Second:The director makes an excellent job and the special effects are super.And third: the acting is pretty good.If you're a fan of Jason or Michael Myers, or even Scream, you'll love this movie.See you!!"
4,A Really Great Ripper Movie,"I recently picked up this DVD and was really happy with it.I've been interested in Jack the Ripper for a long time and this copycat movie is one of the best I've seen.It has everything that a horror movie should have.......gore,suspence,cool murders and alot of twists and turns."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,"what has happened to hollywood???!!!! why are films like this even alowed to be made, as if thats not enough its storyline is not even orininal it uses almost the exact same story as another thriller film, the only difference is that the other film is actually worth watching."
3,"Good Book, but author/publisher was smoking something","when they priced the product.I already own Arzac's book which is excellent for valuation, but I was looking for a more comprehensive book covering other aspects of M&A.;Book contains some good material, but the price for the book is too high without a CD-ROM offering supplemental spreadsheets and other information. Table of Contents is very deceiving.At best, the book's material is worth $100 and, as such, I am returning it for a refund.I will go with either Brunner's book (with CD-ROM) or DePamphilis' book which also includes a CD-ROM."
4,Nice clamping aid,"These blocks are a nice clamping aid. They make it easy to clamp in two directions at once with Bessey K-Body clamps. The only down side is that they are a little pricey. You can get them in a bundle with Bessey K-Body clamps here at Amazon, which is a good deal."
2,Could be better engineered,"While I love my Bessey clamps, these blocks are less than impressive. The clamp falls below the block top creating an uneven surface for the glue up. The blocks should be made not to protrude above the clamp bar. That way the clamp bar provides a straight resting area for the wood to lay flat.I will try to remove the top quarter inch from the blocks to make them usable. Otherwise make your own."
5,Blues Improvisation Complete - like it!,"I got a hold of the bass clef version at the library and ended up liking it so much I ordered the treble clef version (I play piano) I especially like the quality of the recordings and the real-life sound they give you. Also, the progressions are cool and you can learn a lot by trying to figure out where/how they used tritone substitutions. Nothing brain science but very practical. I'm about intermediate in level and the book seems suited for that."
3,This is where the music would go...,"This DVD needs to have a disclaimer on the package regarding the documentary including no Cash music. There is a lot of good footage, and many good revelations that I didn't know about JC, but for God's sake, folks, include at least a little music! Luckily, I borrowed it from the libarry!"
3,classic standup; technically poor.,"One of the all-time greatest stand-ups is dealt an injustice with this poor transfer to DVD. The poorly compressed video causes a very annoying ""lag"" as Pryor moves about the stage--his hair seems to moves moments after the rest of his body. My VHS copy taped from cable years ago looks better. Still, it's easily the funniest 90 minutes of stand-up you'll ever see. Alone, Pryor's performance earns this 5 stars, docked two stars for the poor quality. This performance deserves better!"
5,Richard Pryor At His Very Best !,"To be short and to the point, I think this is Richard Pryors best stand up video.A ture comedy ledgend!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"This is the funniest 90 minutes of my life!However, the audio syncing on the DVD is SO BAD that it is extremely distracting. Buy the VHS version."
5,The Best Life Performance of the Best Comic ever...,"Richard was incredible on the album, and the video is even funnier. Black men walking too cool to be bitten by snakes...deer drinking...dogs consoling him when his pet monkey died....sexual inadquecies...Richard hits it all, and it's as funny in 2005 as it was when it came out. Chappelle, Rock, Murphy... they all pay homage to the Jedi Master of Comedy. This was him at his best..."
4,Funny,This is Richard Pryors funniest stand up by far! The problem is the DVD sound was delayed with the running film picture. Still-its his funniest ever.
3,Is that Denzel?,"At the beginning when the house lights are still up and a man is in front taking pictures of Richard, is that Denzel Washington in the front row? He has a mustache and bell bottom pants, but it sure looks like him, even has the same mannerisms I've seen in interviews and movies. This totally distracted me from Richard, so I had to start over, but how fun if it is him. He would have been about 25 at the time. Anyway, if you are offended by this DVD it's your own fault. Its Richard Pryor for sakes alive! I enjoyed it and laughed alot!"
3,"Excellent Content, Very Bad Quality.","I've always found Richard Pryor to be very funny.. Once I saw this concert on DVD I couldn't stop myself from ordering it. However, I was very disappointed to find how the picture and sound qualities were of that level.. They were way below expectations..I gave it 3 stars for the material.. I can not give it a single star for the quality."
5,Richard Pryor Is Still The Funniest man In The world!!!!,I especially loved when Richard Pryor made the jokes about the dogs. I espicially love dogs and have all of my life.
5,Lady of Green Cheer says,I have 15 other charms on my Italian charm bracelet. This one sparkles with true December birthday birthstones. Quality piece.
1,needs more,"This book contains little useful information. The activites seem to be book filler, offering no substantive material. The section about financial aid is decent, but you can get this information elsewhere. This book states general rules about transfering that you probably already know. I did not find any ""guerilla tactics."""
1,I Got Taken,"I played Phlinx online at Pogo. It was enjoyable and offered a challenge. This Phlinx To Go is a childs game. The graphics are entirely different & fuzzy. To add insult to injury, there was a coupon included in the jewel case that was suppose to allow you to play 5 days of Pogo online games for free. I purchased the game on 1/13/07; The coupon EXPIRED on 1/1/07. To date I have been unable to get a replacement. Pogo customer service does not handle this problem. As far as I am concerned, Phlinx To Go is a ripoff."
1,Very disappointing!,This game turned out to be very boring. It is just the same thing over and over again with no changes. Sorry I bought it.
3,its....aiight.,"Aint bad... They can harmonize... but this release is kinda mediocre... Get gone is the bomb... Overall, theyre cool... but nothing earth shattering...I figured theyd be interchangeable with that other guy group Profyle... (they also has a song w/ Joe (+ Chico)Wassup w/ Joe and all the guest spots?) But Profyle definitely has more of an edge.It wont hurt to get this CD... but Im pretty sure you wouldnt miss it if you pass it by."
3,Ah-ight for a freshman release,"I was once skeptical about Ideals debut, since many R&B first single hits came from not so credible albums. But this album is ok for a true R&B lover like myself, given they laced it with those two tight joints produced by Teddy Bishop ""Things you can't do"" and ""There's no way"". Of course who could not like there hit single ""Get gone"". There production could be just a little bit tighter next time. No affense to my boy Joe, one of the tightest R&B masters in the Business, Love you my n***a, but Joe's cut ""Jealous Skies"" is hittin' too."
5,Great job Jonte Austin,this was a good performance done by the remarkable Jonte Austin who is a graduate of the North Atlanta School of Performing Arts. This album is so good considering the fact that it is a freshman album. I give it thumbs up. It has the lyrics of a Native Atlantan and the sound of Houston Natives.
3,Some Brothas who can actually flow on an R&B CD,Its Worth the money.It has more than 6 good tracks which is hard to come by now I recommend you listen to track 11 jealous Skies.
4,Pretty Good.,"I was hooked on the ""Get Gone"" track. That is the anthem for the good fellas that got dogged by bad women. It happens! Back to the subject, the album is not bad. What helps this group out the most is that they harmonize very well together. The harmonizing compliments the lead singer Maverick alot. Im not saying that he cant sing, Im saying that they sound good together, unlike other groups when you just recognize the lead singer.The album is pretty mellow through out the whole thing. The other songs to look for besides the ones allready out are ""Never Let You Go"", ""Things You Cant Do"" and ""Get Down With Me"". This is a solid album worth getting."
5,It's exactly what it says it is,"If you've never cooked at all and suddenly find yourself forced to do it and you have no idea where to get started, this is the book to pick up. There's nothing like it. It's exactly what any fumblefingered bachelor needs. Why is it out of print?"
5,Wow,"I wish everyone could have a chance to experience this wonderful work of art. The music and the words are encreditable and when you are famaliar with them, just the music alone is enough to take you where you need to go."
5,Top notch. Very graceful and respectful. Helpful even when going through difficult times.,Top notch. Very graceful and respectful. Helpful even when going through difficult times personally. A friend of mine had this playing in the background as she did Healing Touch work on me. I relaxed very deeply and let go into the experience. I use it to play in the background to go to sleep at times. The messages are simple and stay with you. There is a wonderful variety of cultures and experiences; seriousness and mirth. Highly recommended.
1,This book contains a factual error in its first sentence!,"I think Jim Haskins had a cute idea and was more interested in making a quick buck than in getting the facts right.The first page of the Russian counting book contains a glaring factual error: There is NOT only one Kremlin in Russia. In addition to the one in Moscow, there is a white brick kremlin in the Tatar capital, (cf http://www.kcn.ru/tat_en/kazan/kazkreml.html); Kremlins were very common in the 8-15th centuries throughout Russia, and were usually built of wood. The Moscow and Kazan' kremlins have survived b/c they are stone. There may be others; I am not an expert..."
3,Poorly indexed and not enough meat,A book which purports to be 'technical' should have an excellent index. The 3 volumes in the Comer set have an index rated at about 5 (out of 10). The style of writing is clear and well organized but the depth is only 6 or 7. I was looking for a real 'nuts and bolts' view and this volume/set didn't provide it. I own all 3 volumes but if I had to do it again I would buy the set by Stevens.
2,Why settle for less,"Why settle for less when you can get THE book series on the subject. I find this book very weak and I strongly recommand all the books from Richard Stevens (TCP/IP illustrated v1,2,3. APUE...) wich provide the best reference. This book is for beginner but not for people serious about the subject."
4,Lovely gadget for a bluetooth lover!,"I have no complain whatsoever with this bluetooth headset. It is good fit in the ear and good sound. It is easy to find my celfone Sony Ericsson P900 via bluetooth connectivity.Although the bad side really is the battery life of the headset, it is not really long life to what is expected.The weight and the size of the headset are the one that turns me on with this product.I recommend it to bluetooth headset lover!"
4,Hands free,"It's nice, easy to use, elegant and sofisticated. It's worth its price and was delivered quickly..."
4,"Great sound, best yet....mic still picks up background noise.","This is a great unit - replacing a MOTOROLA-HS850. The HS850 not only had poor sound quality from the ear phone, the mic was horrible too.I have decided ""to accept the fact that a bluetooth headset/mic will never be able to eliminate some or any background noise"" and to move on. On a positive not, at least the earphone on this guy is somewhat louder than the rest.I am pleased with the battery life, sleek look and volume of sound - still disappointed with the the ""DSP"" that Sony claims will be the end all of sound processing - this is not the case. However, I do have to hand it to them - it will pick up a sneeze 20 yards off, like it was next to you.Overall, I would buy the unit again - unit is fairly comfortable. Couldn't give it a 5 star rating because of the mic, but overall have been happy."
3,HBH IV835,"I needed a Blue Tooth that did not hook over my ear. The choices were slim, and that's how I came to pick the Sony. I was disappointed as it kept falling out of my ear. It comes with 3 little black rubber adaptors, but all of them were too small. The second problem was the buttons on the unit were also too small. I found it was not userfriendly. The lite indicator was not bright enough either, so it was hard to distinquish whether the unit was on or off. I returned it."
2,Attractive but not usable,Bought this to avoid loops around ear etc. This one kept falling all the time - totally useless. It surely looks great.Returned it to Amazon.
3,ok product with some problem,"the product is not as small and slick as it looks on the picture, but that is fine. the problem is the battery life is really unstable. it died on me without warning during my calling the first night after an hour talking on the phone. i don't know how long the battery can last, it died twice during the first two days. after that i didn't talk much on the phone, so the bluetooth seems to stay active for about 2 days on average.Another problem is the active range for this bluetooth is not very far. if i am talking in the kitchen and my phone is in the bed room, it does not work. i am not sure whether all the other bluetooth is like this, but this is definitely a disadvantage.overall, just for normal car-driving, same-room talking, it works fine."
4,Not To Bad,"I have trouble having normal head phones fit in my ear so I wasn't so sure about this one, but after putting on the smaller rubber it's great. I wish the battery lasted a bit longer. The sound is great on both ends. Minimal are noise on the other end. I'm totally happy with it!"
1,Microsoft Windfows XP Professional UPGRAGE with SP2,After installation frustration I went back to Windows 2000 Pro. I ended up partitioning my hard drive and installed XP Pro on the second partition so that I could always fall back to Windows 2000. The *update installer* on the CD was not working correctly and I used the restore points to undo all updates. When SP3 was installed ALL my problems went away. I have a cloned OS hard drive so that I never have to re-install out-of-the-box.
1,If you value your PC--DON'T GET SP2!,"Windows XP SP2 is a headache especially if you are upgrading. Windows XP started out as pretty good and then the Microsoft Committees ruined it. People who have upgraded have had trouples with devices not working, Anti-Virus software not working correctly and guess what--IT STILL HAS SECURITY FLAWS! The IT world has had nothing nice to say about this crappy SP."
4,Exactly what I wanted...,This was exactly what I wanted and delivery was very prompt. I will order from them again.
1,Don't Upgrade from W2K to XP,"It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now ""researching"" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K."
3,Amazingly overpriced for a captive audience,"At the same time that Microsoft is discontinuing sales for Windows XP, they continue to charge $199 to upgrade XP Home to XP Pro. There is not much additional functionality provided except for the networking support required to allow a computer to join a Domain. Hence companies of any size that require this must pay an artifically-inflated price because they have no option. It is also somewhat buggy in that the upgrade can disable some functions as documented by Microsoft Knowledgebase entries."
2,Not impressed.,"I purchased these shears to use as bandage scissors, and I was very disappointed. The take-apart design was very loose at the hinges and made them not cut well at all. I even had them professionally sharpened at a hardware store, and they still wouldn't cut more than three or four layers of gauze bandage at a time without ""chewing"" through them. Not worth the money."
5,My twins LOVE it!,My children are all grown and we adopted a set of twins 8 months ago so I'm new to all the baby toys Again! They love this mat. They both sit on it or around it and just laugh. I just went ahead and ordered a second one at $11.** It's a steal.
3,My baby likes it,"Ordered it when it went on sale. Read the online review and agree that it is smaller than it shows on picture. It is very colorful and my 6 months old son loves it. The mat itself is detachable and washable, so I don't worry it getting dirty. All the attachments are stationary once attached. I think it maybe fun for younger child with less mobility, but doubt it for a one year old toddler."
5,Best Playmat!!!!!!!!,My daughter loved this playmat! We have 3 other playmats that we received as gifts but none of them keep her attentin like this one does!!!!!
1,Don't trust Amazon any more!,"I ordered this item along with others when they were on sale.After 36 hours I received email from Amazon saying that they ""are unable to offer this item for the incorrectly posted price. Therefore, have cancelled order for this item"". It was a baby shower gift! And I have a Prime membership (was supposed to receive item tomorrow). I'm very dissapointed with Amazon!"
1,Customers pay for Amazon Mistakes,"I ordered this item at a very attractive price, about 85% off: When I checked the status of my order I notice that the item was not on the shipment confirmation email so I contacted the customer service and they said that the item was cancelled due to incorrect posted price. They didn't bother to let me know the item was cancelled and I was counting with it because it was a present for my baby daughter; I also have a prime membership now I have to go shopping for my little princess present."
4,"A ""Must See"" for students of the Van Halen guitar method","For those who miss Sammy Hagar, this will take you back a few years to when it all began. With blazing leads and the only drum solo that I've ever heard go faster than a sound processor allows...this video is AWESOME. Definitely worth the bucks for any collector of VH material."
4,Good dvd.,Really like this dvd. Not always been a big fan of Van Halen but have seen them twice. Loved it when I was younger. Still love some songs.
3,Van halen,Great customer service. I Received the DVD very quick. Would do business with them again. Thank you vey much a++
2,don't bother,"Now I'm a BIG van halen fan and all but this is a little weak, worst off Sammy's-I wanna be Dave-antics are a little hard on the eyes, the songs sound good but when sung by a bette milder lookalike dancing around in one of the worst outfits I've ever seen (even for the 80's) the whole thing loses its appeal. The stage show's lacking the flavor of anything entertaining and the drum and bass solo's are 4 minutes to long. Good though is the fact that sammy doesn't butcher roth songs but unfortunetly does a number on his own, lets also hope he works on the audience participation skills. Buy if die hard VH fan, skip if you like a roth and cherroo--extreme guy."
2,HAGAR THE HORRIBLE.,"In this concert video, we will see how Van Halen devolved from a groundbreaking, heavy metal band with bona fide talent to a bubble gum group headed by a schmuck who thinks he's cool just because he drinks tequila and writes a trillion songs with the word ""love"" in the title. To see the REAL AND ORIGINAL VH, go to Amazon Auctions and bid on rare concert footage from the early years which shows what Eddie could really do and how they could still be around today despite making such poor personnel decisions (i.e. Hagar and Charone)."
4,Live without Annette,"A sparkling concert and a journey back to the heydey of Van Halen (post Diamond Dave) in a remarkable concert that occurred coincident with the Chernobyl disaster. Even old Mitch Hagar can't spoil the festivities as the boys rope-in song after song from their oeuvre and play it to perfection. Hagar's melodic rant against speed-limits somewhat mars the proceedings as its simplistic style is several steps below VH's standards. But all-in-all this is a solid sonic outing from our boys and Eddie's ***damn solo is worth the price of admission. I bought the VHS 19-years ago and to this day Eddie still makes me say ""hooooooweeee that moe foe can play that gee-tar! Tell ya wot!"""
1,"Bad, very bad.","I have not received this DVD yet, what the deal? This is the only time Amazon has failed to deliver."
2,FILMED IN 1986 NOT 2004 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"FYI: BOUGHT THIS DVD BECAUSE I DON'T GET TO SEE MANY LIVE CONCERTS & WAS WANTING TO SEE SOME RECENT FOOTAGE, BUT THIS WAS ACTUALLY FILMED IN 1986 IN NEW HAVEN CT, IT'S A DECENT CONCERT, BUT THE SOUND IS PRETTY BAD, THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE THE DRUM SOLO, EDDIE'S 10min SOLO, & THE BASS SOLO REALLY SUCKED BAD !! ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10.......... 5"
5,The secret to Eddie's guitar prowess is his smile,"I remember seeing this when it was first shown on MTV back in 1986 (I think). So impressed was I that I bought the video as soon as it came out.The newly minted version of VH were in happy times and this video clearly shows it. Listening to EVH is one thing-- to see him in action is another.One facet left out of pure listening to a musician is the body gestures and the facial movements made by the musician. Eddie has a huge grin on his face the entire time he's playing. You realize that perhaps if you could be that happy about playing your instrument you'd be that good, too.But the entire band counts, too. The performance is quite good and the music is really good too. This video helps you realize why VH is one of the most important rock and roll bands ever."
4,Something to replace your VHS tape,"Fans who buy Van Halen bootlegs will ask why-oh-why wasn't ""Wild Thing"" included from this concert. Here, both Ed and Sam go into a dueling guitar solo that rivals anything you'll find in your classic rock collection. Seeing Sam on guitar so often is something really missed from today's VH concert, even when doing the 5150 tunes with Ed on keyboard (and NOT prerecorded).Video focus and sound quality aside, this concert is Van Halen at their peak -- a reinvented group that was to the 80's what Zeppelin and the Beatles were to previous generations. Don't mind those who can't get past their fixation on the Roth years, as this video shows what the band became when a fourth -musician- was added. (Where'd that guy go to anyway -- Rhino records, Vegas and replacement shock jock. Thank God he left VH)."
2,Not the best Van Hagar . DVD,"This DVD is disappointing, in a few aspects. Firstly the sound is weak, I found the audio mix to be off and muted. Secondly the video is fuzzy and poorly focused, moving around too much without focusing on Eddie or anyone else for that matter. The set list is barely passing at C-. If you want a better Van Hagar DVD get : Right Here Right Now. It has a Better Set list, better sound and much better Video. Now where is my Real Van Halen DVD? I want David Lee Roth ERA VH on DVD please........."
3,Did I miss something here?,"The first 150 pages are a good picture of the life of an ex-child-prodigy being caught up and overtaken by his peers. Then Fry decides to bring in the well-worn plot about ""prevent Hitler and history might get worse"". Of course there's nothing wrong with doing an old thing again if you can give it a breath of fresh air, but Fry's story is about as fresh as week-old herring and smells similarly. Some good jokes and one-liners admittedly, but in general it was a huge disappointment for me, especially after his brilliant book ""The Liar""."
2,a disappointment ...,"Making History is about a Cambridge student, Michael, and a physics professor who, by transporting sterility drugs through time to a well in Austria, create a world were Hitler had never been born. Making History is conceptually interesting, but poorly executed and at times exceedingly dull. Many of the action sequences are written in a screenplay format, which leaves some of the book's major scenes without any narrative description and results in tedious chapters where characters act without discernable motivation. The slower paced, more interesting first person narrative style is abandoned (it seems) in favor of getting quickly through scenes that, though vital to the plot, do not afford the oppurtunity for clever banter or amusing description that the author is so fond of. The resolution is forced and unsatisfying, and there are glaring holes in the plot that are never resolved. Fry is a witty writer, but I think he is overreaching with this book."
3,A Sloppy Alternate History Novel,"I stumbled across this book in an online review named something like ""The Ten Best Alternate History Sci-Fi Novels"". Since I pretty much had all the others this one stood out, and I ordered it shortly thereafter.In retrospect I kinda wished I'd kept my money. The subject matter is intriguing (what if Hitler had never been born?) but beyond that the book is rather sloppy and hard to follow at times, particularly in the beginning. Once the storyline gets moving there's a sudden ""reset"" (can't say too much without revealing the plot) and you get to re-read big chunks of almost-the-same-but-subtly-different history. It frankly wasn't all that well written the first time around.For die-hard alternate history fans only, or folks who just love Stephen Fry's works."
4,"a great ""what if?"" read (if a less than original topic)","I never read this book in English, I've only read it in German (translated by Ulrich Blumenbach), so some of the wordplays didn't come across that well, and neither did the difference between the British and the American, but the story is still great. I particularly enjoyed the somewhat circular story line. All in all, very enjoyable."
2,Doesn't go anywhere,"The story starts out rather promising. But as it goes on it gets progressively worse. The worst part being when the author stops writing in paragraphs and instead pretends that he is writing a screenplay. The rest of the story isn't particulary good. I don't know if the author was trying to get across a point, but if he was he didn't do a good job getting it across. I also found it frusturating the way the author attempted to tell two different stories at once. Unless your a really big fan of alternate history stories, I really wouldn't recommend this book. There just isn't any real point to the story. The book comes across as incoherent babble, not as a story with a central focus."
3,An incredible book - until the last fifty pages,"I would give this book a solid 4 stars or even 5, but the ending just drags it back down to earth. I could scarcely stop reading, mesmerized, and was suckered into reading until the end.The ending itself is a tremendous letdown. After all the buildup, everything is quickly and neatly tied up in a bow. In addition, Mr. Fry chooses the last few pages to insert a huge change of direction for the character that has absolutely no continuity with the rest of the book. I'm not a moral policeman or making a political comment on what happens - it just doesn't seem to fit with the story. I have likened it with friends to being led down a long and interesting path, only to find a dead-end and nothing more to explain it than a wacky message on a signpost.Was he rushed in finishing this book? Whatever the reason, this book will not find a place on my best-of list."
3,"Good read, a bit slow in parts","I loved the humor in this book (except some of the British humor, which admittedly sometimes escapes me) and especially the main character. I found some parts of the book a little tedious, but found that when I skipped ahead, I would miss crucial parts. It all comes together at the end. An enjoyable book, but not one I would necessarily read again."
5,Terrific!,"Laughed and laughed...this is a wonderful, well-written, free-wheeling intelligent book. One of the few gay authors who can write wittily about gay sex (gay love, actually) without being in-your-face all the time about it. Does not let his sexuality overwhelm the story line. Buy it and read it today."
4,"Water, water, everywhere!","Stephen Fry has produced a novel that not only causes laught but also intrigues the mind. Ever thought 'what if the German's had won?'well, Fry considers this situation. We the readers are merely dragged along with a plot that is audacious to say the least. Hitler is, in fact, not the dictator of the world at all. Instead there is some kind of 'imposter'. The world is actually a better place to be in with Hitler as part of its history. The story sees our leading character dashing in time to remove a pill from the water supply that distorts what we now know as histroy. Inventive to an unpresidented extreme.If there is one flaw, it has to be the slightly weak conclusion. One feels that there could have been something with a little more impact than what we do get. However, this should not deter you from reading this exellent book. Any weaknesses this novel has are easily outweighed by its merits."
4,An interesting twist on a tried-and-true sci-fi plot,"What if you could prevent Hitler from taking power? What would you do to prevent it? How far would you go? All interesting questions and Stephen Fry's take on the idea is well worth a read. Although the writing style can be jolting at times and some of the references are kind of out there, it all comes together eventually. Overall a brilliant effort, although at one point one of Fry's characters discusses political correctness and actually uses it in a positive context. Fry must be one of the few people left in the western world who can actually find anything good to say about PC.But hey, it IS science fiction!"
4,The genius: Mr Stephen Fry,"I feel so unworthy of submitting a review of such a fabulous writer. I have just read the other reviews for this book and most people, as they do for all his books, comment on his wonderful use of the English language. I purchased this book as I am a great admirer of Stephen Fry the comedian and was interested to check out Stephen Fry the writer. I was enthralled! I remained in my PJ's all day and didn't put the book down until I had finished. One reviewer mentioned his unease with Hitler and Humour being used in tandem. I found parts of this book humourous, but from my humble point of view, the whole scenario left me feeling uneasy and got me thinking 'what if' and 'oh my god'. This is a very clever, very funny and extremely well written that left this reader with a very strong message to try and assimilate."
1,Poorly Written Second Half,"While the first half is rather tediose, and only mildly boring, the second half is an insult to the reader. It appears that the author was given a sizable advance, ran out of time, and threw together the second half of this book from some working notes. Then, his publisher was too afraid to not publish the work due to contractual agreements even though the work as a whole is a waste of time, money, and trees."
3,Fry's imagination not quite as funny as his real life.,"An entertaining read, not as funny as his previous books, but sporadically funny nevertheless. This seems like it was written deliberately for an american market rather than the unselfconsciously english flavour of his previous work. This seems like Fry's first foray outside the realm of personal experience - truth is always funnier than fiction. The end was a bit too cute (& not terribly believable - a twenty-something not knowing whether he prefers women or men?). Anyway, a good way to numb the tedium of a 10 hour flight & a few laughs out loud to annoy other passengers."
1,Trite and banal,"I picked up this book at a library used book table thinking that it might interest my high school students. It was a waste of time and 50 cents. The writing is simplistic and the plot line is banal and boring. It was entirely predictable and Martin, the main character, was not developed in enough detail. The writer also needs an editor who can pick up on some obvious grammatical errors. It is ""He could have gone"" not ""He could have went."" I could understand if this was part of the dialogue used to portray an uneducated character but it was not. Do not waste your time with this one."
4,What is seen in the mirror,"FACE was just that, the face of reality! Being a teen is hard enough without something turning your entire world upside down! The questions we ask and then find the answers makes us wonder why we ever asked them at all. Benjamin Zenphaniah has amazing insight into the mind of a teen while all the while making you realize that whether you survive or not is all up to you.I recommend FACE to anyone who enjoys a challenge!"
1,Slow and stupid!!!!!!! -5 Rating,"OMG- this book was torture to read. Most of the book/ dialog happened in the characters heads. If either of them at any point had just said what they were ""Thinking"" then the entire book would have been 5 pages tops. I don't see this need to prolong ""thoughts"" and live in doubt and be ""sad"" when they both supposedly felt the same way about each other but through pride, misunderstandings and misinformation, the book had to drag on and on. I do not know why the previous reviews gave this book 5 stars- it was painful to read."
3,Eva's Story Review,"I was a bit disappointed. The book was in fair condition. However, I loved the story. It was really good!"
3,"good cd, bad racording","just like i said its a good cd with some awsome solos from their guitarist but the cd sounds like crap because of the recording. It sounds like it was recorded in a garage, but they have a new cd out that sounds awsome,it doesnt lack anything that this cd has except the bad recording. The name of the cd is ""Theres Always The Radio"". i hope this helps. thanks"
5,An error by Amazon,"I wrote this book! And I still think it is good, but my concern is to correct your error, not to rank it.Robert H. Getscher"
2,Cheap and cheaply made,"A poorly made product, the belt clip broke within a week of getting the case. For the price I paid I can't complain, I guess."
3,Fashionable,"This case shows off the beauty of my phone and at the same time protects it from scratches. I received my shipment a little late because of a shipment mixup. So far, it has held up and protected my phone from getting scratches when it fell. If it breaks, i'll just buy another...the price is reasonable anyway."
1,PURE. GARBAGE.,I didn't have much expectations for this case for the price that I paid for it. It cracked in 3 days after owning it. The screen on it gets scratched very badly.Bottom line is DO NOT buy this product. The quality of the plastic is beyond ridiculously piss-poor.Save yourself the money and purchase a different one.
1,Not durable,I cracked within the first week of use. I bought a different case to replace it within two weeks of owning this.
2,look for something else,"I've had this case for about two weeks (maybe not even that long) and it already has a crack. I expect this will hold up for a few months at most. The case does not even securely close around the entire phone, so there are open crevices where dust and other things easily get lodged between the case and phone.It looks nice and provides holes for access to all the buttons, but it's not well made."
3,clear case,This looks pretty good with the phone but it get scratches easily....better the case then the phone.....
3,Crystal case,"The case was cheap and flimsy. I have had it for 2 months now and it has not broken yet so I guess it is not all that bad seeing how I origionally thought it would last for only a day. Dirt and sand will get in between the phone and the case and scratch the sides of the screen and the plastic part of the phone. The case is easy to put on and take off. The side and top buttons are hard to push with the case on. Overall, for the $2.00 that I paid for it I guess it is worth it. There are different colors but I would suggest the clear because the whole case lights up when the light or the screen is on which is wicked pisser."
1,Get away from this!,"This is a waste of money is bought this for a friend of mine and i was embarrased when i realize this thing broke up the very first time he use it on his cell, this is garbage. And it doesn't cost $0.01 they get the profit in the ""shipping"" whit an extra $6.00."
2,Worth the shipping??,"Even though it looks nice with the silver w810i, this case has drawbacks. Namely thin and fragile. The clips don't close snug and the case scratches easy. I bought a black case that is nicely sturdy, thicker, and snug fit. So I would recommend paying a little more for a colored case."
1,Stop!,"This is NOT a movie that you want in your collection. I know that opinions can be many, and me myself -well, let's just say that I'm not very picky about movies involving dicovery of lost liners when there is something mysterious and ""spooky"" containing in the story. But this is too amateurish, from a distance the ship looks like a papercut added to a movieclip of the sea -if you get my meaning. The effects(?) are so not convincing, the script ok, but that doesn't save this movie from sinking...Just take my word for it! It's like a bad Baywatch-episode!"
1,Pride and Petticoats,"This is, without a doubt, bar none, the worst book I have ever read. I felt foolish and angry at myself when it was all over. The author did not bother with silly things like character development or basic research(I believe a baron is properly addressed as ""Sir"", not ""Lord""). This book does not have a single thing to recommend it. Had this been the first romance novel I had ever read, it would have been the last.Truly, truly terrible."
3,Good to start the process,"This book was interesting and did make me think through the process of what is important to our family in planning this event. However, it is one of those books that would probably be best checked-out of the library, as I am unlikely to really reference it over and over again. Good for getting the thinking started though."
5,Travel made simple,"I travel alot and am always in search of ways to better organize all of the ""stuff"" that I must bring. I bought this last week and used it on Monday and may never use any of my other bags again, unless I decide to buy it in a different color :^)Baggallini Doctor's Bag Large"
1,Advanced (Beginner) Capoeira,"This has to be the worst tape I have ever seen. There is nothing you can possibly learn from this tape. You are better off watching ""Only The Strong"". The tape looks like they used a regular camcorder that could not zoom out. There was no stucture. Everything looked like they were making things up as they went along. They showed moves that you would learn during warm-ups in class. It is a shame that some capoeiristas do not take any pride in a product that is suppose to help other capoeiristas. Just knowing that I bought this tape leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Please learn from my mistake. Stay away from this tape."
5,Excellent History of Africans in South Carolina,"If you have an interest in the history of Africans in America, specially in South Carolina, this is book will be right up your alley. I did not not detect any bias or underhandedness. It is an educational and enlightening read.If you are a history buff, please pick up this book."
4,Well written....kind of slow,"Black mojority is a momagram written to examinne the life of an african american in carolina during the colonial era. While it is very thourough in ts analysis of the slaves role and growth durning this time, it moves very slowly. I was assigned to read this book for a history course i was taking in college, so this wasn't a book i would noramlly pick up and read. I did find that i learned may things i did not know about this time and slaves. I found it all very facinating. this is a great book to read if you plan to major in history. It is thorough and well put together, all in all a great book to learn and grow from."
2,not the one,"Warns not to exceed maximum bend radius (sic). Visits the same material in multiple sections. Clyde Herrick's book on Telecommunications Wiring is a little closer to being useful, but really, Charles E. Spurgeon's Ethernet: the Definitive Guide has both the installation and configuration information you need."
4,Cabling: The Complete Guide to Network Wiring,Execellent all-around text. Good reference. Would like to see more pictures.
3,TRIVIA,"Homeward Bound is the original version of this Simon and Garfunkel song.Chad & Jeremy cut ""Homeward Bound"" on 11-26-65, before Simon & Garfunkels's on 12-14-65."
1,Not Happy with BIC,"I ordered this Item from BIC last week and I will just attach the E-mail from the company so no one else will order the wrong item.E-Mail stated.....There is a different item number for the chrome, and a different for the white. Under technical details you can clearly see that this is for the white as following.48190 RACK,3-ARM WHIIf you want to do an exchange, that isn't a problem. But, I would greatly appreciate if you can please remove the feedback that you left for our company, before I give you instructions on that.This item is only $5 and shipping is $6. For the product and the cost its not worth it.This is what you will have to deal with if you purchase from this company."
1,total sham!,"What a crock! It misleading calls itself cardio-capoeira when there are no workout routines in sight, just a scantily clad chick swaying from side to side, interspersed with clips of actual capoeira fighters. Total ripoff!"
4,Really a four and a half.,"Jack was truly a stand up guy. He took responsible when he didn't have to. He also had a deep love for Kelley that never wavered even though he sacrificed nine years of his life for it.This is where I had a problem with Kelley. What she made Jack do all those years ago was wrong, for everyone involved. She never gave him the benefit of the doubt or allowed him to check any further to verify what the truth really was. Sadly for everyone involved he was the one who was right all along. Kelley allowed her own past to force something that screwed up many lives. She knew Jack would do anything for her simply because he loved her so much and wanted her to be proud of him.But I liked Kelley in spite of herself and Jack is the kind of man we all hope we're lucky enough to find!I've already ordered the sequel for this one!"
3,A Good Read...,"But it just lacked something. It had great storyline with ""second chance at love"" being the main premise. The problem was I had no connection with a few of the characters namely Kelley and her sister Madison. By page 100 I was fed up with that whole storyline and felt that it was taking away too much from the main plot which was Jack and Kelley finding love again.This is not to say that the story was not good, and Ms. Heath's debut contemporary was mildly entertaining once you got past the whole teenage angst issue. Jack was a great hero with plenty of patience for both ladies in his life.Ms. Heath is a very talented author and one that I would highly recommend to the romance reader. This is just not one of her best efforts and if this is the first time you've ever read her I would suggest the follow up to this story ""Smooth Talking Stranger"".Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"
3,really was an inappropriate relationship,"This was a good book. The characters were well drawn and you really cared about them. So much so that when things are revealed towards the end you really feel for the h. However, the beginning of the relationship between the H and h was a bit disturbing. Couldn't Kelley and Jack have waited . . . even a little bit or how about if they were on the same level; instead of one having more authority over the other?"

3,OK,"Bible study books on Job aren't plenitful. This study wasn't the best. We found it had too much ""feelings"" and not enough Biblical analysis. Job is a wonderful book to study so don't let this review discourage you from doing a study on it."
4,I Think This Is A Good Band,"If this is the band I'm thinking of they are awsome! I'm not sure if it's the same the same band that was featured on last months Guitar World Cd-rom, but if it is, this is one of the best bands i've heard in a long time. If you like Alice in Chains and Black Label Society, you should definantly check these guys out."
5,Loooove it!,"My daughter, one and a half, loves it. I find it one of the most entertaining children's programs around (for adults, that is), which is important when you have to watch the thing repeatedly. The stories are entertaining and teach good lessons. Sometimes my daughter will say ""dance"" and I'll put on the music videos for her. The songs are original and cute. I think my daughter has a crush on Max ;)!"
3,Dragon Tales,"It's good animation for kids. You can see the pretty girl Emmy, her borther Max, dragon Quetzal, Ord etc. They learn challenges through adventure on the world."
4,This book is good clean fun.,I really enjoyed this book. It isn't great literature but it is a good read. The concepts behind telekenesis are well thought out and interesting. I found myself liking the main characters even though the characters are a little one demensional. If you like books about the paranormal you'll like this book.
3,Super Reader,"Teek has your firestarter plot. A young woman discovers she has telekinetic abilities, and an evil agency decides that want to use them, of course.She is a teenager, not a little girl, so is more able to fend for herself from that point of view. Ok, if blandly predictable."
4,series,"this book (and it's two other books) were the first of the ""biblical fiction"" series i read. and the story of joseph had already been one of my favorite bible stories.i read all three of these books in a month. and then when i just moved and rediscovered them in a box i reread them and found them to be just as enjoyable as the first.there is a whole lot of added story line in here and the scripture dosn't interwine as much as i'd have liked but it was all in all a great read.and if you read this series and like it... you will for sure enjoy lynn austins ""chronical of the kings"" series."
5,"Fabulous, unforgettable book!",I have just read Dreamers and it was fabulous. I just could not put the book down. I took it everywhere. I am a librarian and I would recommend this to anyone. I even told my dad to read it. This book had a little suspense. I would read my Bible and then the book. I am certain that with this series I definitely will not forget the Bible story.
3,"Well researched, but bloodless","I like Egyptian history and the biblical story of Joseph, so I eagerly picked up this book. The author obviously did her work well, and gives a strong sense of day to day life in Ancient Egypt. I also liked how Hunt chose to link Joseph's time in Egypt to actual historical pharoahs.Still, the book read a bit like ""The Ten Commandments"" to me: the basic story from Genesis was there, but there were many added characters and subplots that are transparently fictional. Joseph and Tuya are so saintly and the bad guys so obviously evil that there wasn't much character development or suspense. Also I couldn't help but feel I was being preached to a bit. The book is also very simplistically written: I could certainly recommend it for children or young adults as it is quite ""G"" rated throughout."
5,Great book and great series!,"I must say that I absolutely LOVED the first book 'Dreamers' and I didn't think it could get any better...I was wrong! 'Brothers' was even better and the third book 'Journey' I am in the process of finishing. I have enjoyed it as much if not even a little more than the previous two books.I can't believe how much I'm learning about Egypt and the Bible, just by reading your book! I personally don't like historical fiction because I don't like the history part, but with your books I get the history without even knowing it!"
5,GREAT OVERVIEW OF HARRY,"This CD arrived last week, and has not been off my player yet! The tunes are phenomenal, and so is the sound! Nobody could make a trumpet sound like a vocalist more than James. GRAB IT."
5,Harry James' hits with much improved 1950s recording quality,"Yes, these are remakes of some of Harry James' great songs from the 1930s, but it is great to hear James recorded on first-rate Capitol Records equipment in the mid-1950s. Big Band music is wonderful, and this is much more rewarding to listen to than the scratchy old masters from 20 years earlier.More importantly -- this album MOVES. Of course James' trumpet is the star, but Helen Forrest's vocals work perfectly on the several tracks where she appears. Too often, remakes are pale shadows of the original, but in this case Trumpet Blues stands strongly as (1) a great, mostly uptempo album with classic James tunes and (2) an acceptably high fidelity recording.If you have never bought a Harry James album, this would be a good place to start -- a solid introduction to his music, without the distraction of the uneven early recordings. Be assured it is really James playing, not someone else trying to pay tribute!Recommended."
4,hours of family fun,"very easy to operate, our family have a wonderful time singing together, this magic sing karaoke (Ed-8000) is easy to use and come with lots of songs"
2,Some good information but...,"Whoa, This book is out of date! It starts off with some interesting history about PDAs. The editing is a little rough with typos and stilted english. The AppForge info is two years old. Even worse, the Microsoft embedded Visual Basic chapters are pretty worthless and even more out of date. Save your money for a more recent book."
3,book review,"I am a dentist and bought this to train my assistant. It's a good book, with good depth of theory and a great amount of reference information such as infection control laws. However, the presentation of instruments is pretty poor, with poor quality pictures, a poor and very limited selection of photos of instruments and setups for the various procedures, and it doesn't contain a comprehensive listing of steps for the main dental procedures. Hence, this is a good reference book but not the best practical guide to actual procedures."
4,Excellent Reference,"This is a great reference book to have around especially for those who program AutoCAD in more than just one language. If you need to customize or create applications for AutoCAD using VB, VBA, ObjectARX, ObjectDBX, or AutoLISP you will benefit from the information in this book. This book helped me get a firmer grasp of Symbol Tables, Dictionaries, XData, and Custom Objects. Just check out the table of contents. Each chapter has something to offer even the most experienced ARX or VB programmer."
5,Great AutoCAD Reference,"This is one of the best references on the market. To my understanding, this is the only one that outlines the internal data structure within AutoCAD. This is definitely a ""must-have"" for any AutoCAD automation developer. I only wish someone would publish the same information for the newer revisions. Most (if not all) of this should still apply though."
4,satisfied overall,The blade was delivered in crude packaging that was a recycled diet coke box with lots of tape on it. The blade itself was in good condition although it does not run that well with my machine with is an Acme Supreme Juicerator Cat 6001. I have purchased blades in the past (this is the third blade that I have used) and they have run fine but this blade seems slightly too heavy for the machine and it seems to labor to spin it.
