4,Bad Movie Good Music,"The movie was undisciplined, had gratuitous bad language, and a poor excuse for a plot. The music was excellent. The 1980 tour in support of the album was excellent too. I'm buying this for the second time as my original album was damaged in a fire. Briefcase Full Of Blues would get a slightly higher recommendation."
4,Those Blues Brothers,"The CD is well done, however, I was searching for soundtrack from the movie that wasn't on this CD so I was a little disappointed."
5,What in heck happened last night??,"Speaking of abusing alcohol in dangerous excess - and making light of it - have you seen the brand-new Budweiser TV ads?If so:Whazzzuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!!!!!!!!If not, what's the name of the cave you've been dwelling in?BLOOZE BROTHERS RULE!!!!!!! GO JIMMY!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Blues Brothers,"This is my husbands 3rd copy of this CD! First one got destroyed; second one got left in his old truck when he sold it! So, maybe the third time is a charm! LOL! I bought this to replace the last one for christmas. He laughed and was happy to see it. We both recommend this CD!"
1,Yuck!,"The product look great in the photo, but when it arrived I was sorely disappointed. It looked and felt cheap. Worst item I have received so far. Would love to return it but how?Fadora"
4,ethnic jewerly,"I am pleased with the way it looks on me, but the braclet itself is a little flimsy. It will open easier than most braclets i have bought, but overall for the price i am very pleased with it."
1,Battery won't hold charges,Battery only hold charges for less than pictures (after only about a year of use)
1,not reliable,the card corrupted the day after I brought it and took 50 pictures. Cannot read from the card nor format it again.
2,2 failed cards ...,"I bought two cards from Amazon (Sandisk Ultra II 1GB) for use with the Canon S2. For almost 2 months, they were fine -- fast & worked like a charm.One not-so-fine-day, I got the dreaded ""Memory Card Error"". The cards can't be read either from the camera or the PC.I've contacted Sandisk and returned those 2 cards.Will see how the replacements do ..... I'll hold off the judgment on Sandisk Ultra II SD 1GB card, but 2 failed cards doesn't fair very well in my book so far. (My other Sandisk product, the Mini-Cruzer has been working fine for a few years.)UPDATE: I received the replacements promptly after sending them back. They have been working fine so far (over 4 months), no problem (11/10/06.)I could've had a couple of lemons !! For the record, I've also had Kingston Elite Pro 2GB and a Sandisk Ultra II 1GB- with USB-connector-- They work like a charm from the first day..."
5,Good choice for SD memory,These cards perform very well. I have several 1GB cards as my camera has a 1GB size limitation. I have used Sandisk cards in Compact Flash format as well and never had a problem with any. Highly recommend these cards.
4,SanDisk SD 1GB Ultra II,"So far so good. Works as advertised. I use on a Canon 630 digi cam and am able to take pictures quickly from shot to shot. Moves through image review briskly as well. Don't know how much of that performance is due to the camera or SD or combo of both, but, once again, it works as advertised. No complaints."
4,Faster than others... And you pay the price...,"This SD card is really Faster compared to the previous one I had..That is why I gave it a chance and now I am pleased for not having any lad, specially when using with my Canon S3iS.The Video recording fearture can be the shortcome on some of these SD cards, but not for this one... Never had any slowliness with this SD card so far...OF course, you pay the price on it.. Since it does not comes cheap, that is true...But I think it's good at the overall picture !"
5,Simply works fine. No data loss for sure.,When I bought this product I was worried because my previous card (an old one with 256 Mb) had problems and I lost a lot of pictures. This one is fine. I have it for some time and I left it with data inside for more than 3 months and when I get back it was all there. Great product.
4,Good chip,This chip serves my purposes just fine. It's fast and does the job. I'm going to get a larger chip next time since my camera takes up a lot of memory on best quality.
5,Great value for Sandisk high quality,This is the better choice if you want to avoid those no-name-generic-brand SD flash memories out there.
3,Great product but rebate program is a sham,"The memory works briliantly. It is a shame however that they tarnish their name with a rubish rebate program. In Dec 2005 they offered a $20 rebate on the 1GB units (Sandisk that is). My rebate was there by Dec 17th and is still sitting in a state called check processing. If they cannot deliver on their promise of 8 weeks, they should not offer these rebates it leaves a bad taste with the consumer even though the product itself is excellent. Come on guys get it togetherTony"
5,SanDisk Memory Card,We purchased this card for a Cannon A530 Powershot. It is as easy as opening the package and inserting into the camera. We have used it for taking video and pictures. It has worked perfectly!
5,SanDisk Ultra Memory Card,Great product - waiting a couple of days for the mail was worth the savings. Store prices were much more expensive for the same product.
4,Not worth the extra money,"Compared to the normal speed memory of same capacity, it's nothing special. Unless you're a pro, there's no reason to buy the super-speedy memory."
4,SanDisk SDSDH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card (Retail Package),Memory works fine. The delivery of the product was a little worrisome. They left it in full Sun outside the main door. Someone could have easily picked it up.
1,incompatiblew with sandisk 12-1 card reader,"recently bought this card - DOES NOT = read in SanDisk's own crd reader.reads in old Dazzle and in Emachines integrated card reader.Sandisk's answer - try another of their cards (same, e.g. Ultra) and card reader.never mind that the card reads in other readers - and the reader reads other brand cards.somethings amiss when they sell without advising that there's a question of interoperability between with the brand."
3,Locked up,"It is fast. It is just the right size. The problem is that the locking feature seems to be onabout 80% of the time. I have switched it off and on with little luck. I guess on the positive side, I won't have to worry about overwriting the pictures I took."
4,SanDisk 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card,"It's a very nice card. Very reliable, recomended. It's speed is OK but not as good as Extreme III. Never had problems with destroyed images. If you shoot in raw mode you 'll have to search for a SDHC (4GB or more)- I can shoot only 63 photos with my K10D."
1,Great card--for about three months,"I got my first card in July of 2006 to use with my Canon S3 digital camera. It was great through mid-October. Then I started having memory card errors, and the card finally died completely. SanDisk's warranty/return policy made getting a replacement easy.The second card lasted about three months as well. Same problem.Got a THIRD card from SanDisk. Another three months have passed, and the card just died--right on schedule. Only thing I can think is that it doesn't like having photos deleted using a computer and card reader instead of the camera. Funny thing--never have this problem with my 2GB SanDisk Extreme III SD card or my SanDisk 256MB SD card. It's just this model.SanDisk is great about replacing the cards, but this three-month cycle of death and replacement is getting old."
4,"San Disk Ultra II, 1.0GB, from eMartBuy","[...]I purchased the card for my new Pentax Optio W20 digital camera. I installed the card and it formatted almost instantly. The first forty pictures were taken at the camera's highest resolution: 7 megapixels and 3072x2304. I downloaded the pictures on to my desktop using the USB cable that came with the camera. The same pictures were also downloaded on my laptop by inserting the card in the built-in card reader. I didn't time the download, but it seemed very fast to me.In conclusion, I have to say: GREAT PRICE, GREAT CARD, GREAT DELIVERY! ([...]"
3,Review of Digital Memory Card,"I received this product in a very timely manner. It works just the same as all others. However, since receiving it, I have found that I could have locally purchased the same product at half the cost and didn't have to pay the shipping. From now on, I will purchase this item locally."
3,Average,"I rate this as average, olny because it performs as expected.I have not used for an extended amount of time.The cost was not more than a regular card so I bought it thinking ""why not"""
1,eMartBuy Ltd vendor not reliable,Placed an order for this item on Aug 28 - total + $16 shipping. Charged our CC on Aug 28 - claim to ship on Aug 29 by US Postal. It's been 17 days - sent an inquiry to CS and got a response to wait for it another week. I filed a claim with Amazon - what a waste of time! Later per checking feedbacks - found I wasn't the only one with the similar problem. I hope Amazon is looking into this. Of course on the feedback - it response to refund back but I never receive any email from them. This is not how web orders should work.... I may have better luck on ebay. Now I have to go out during lunch break to pick this item up. Hope this helps to other readers.....
4,"A good card for the money, and very fast","I bought this card for my new Canon Powershot S2. I used it on our month-long vacation and had no problems with it whatsoever, and in fact was very pleased with the speed in which it seems to process. I haven't had any problems with data corruption (as other reviewers have mentioned), but then again I haven't had the card incredibly long. Still, I consider 30 days of extensive (and constant) use under varying conditions to be a good test, and I have to say that I'm pleased with the card."
5,Works Well,Put this in my Canon Powershot S3 IS and gave it a low level format. Worked right away and haven't had any trouble. Card seems to be pretty fast as well.
1,Lasted only a few weeks - complete waste of money,"I bought two Sandisk 1 GB SD memory cards as my old SD cards are too slow for the new digital cameras. Unfortunately, within a few weeks both of them became unreadable.I have used the two cards on different cameras, so the problem can't possibly be with the cameras. My old SD cards never had any problems. I have used Sandisk Ultra II flash cards before, and they are very reliable. However, think twice before you invest in these."
5,Service,Not much to review about the product: standard SD card----it works. The 5 stars are really for the supplier. Outstanding: price was unbeatable; delivery was 2 days after I placed order. I'll use them again!
4,Reliable,"I've several Ultra II cards in both Palm products and cameras, and have not had a bit of trouble on any of them. What more can be said for these cards. I don't have a way of assessing their speed, but, downloading off a card reader seems fairly fast. But they are just reliable!"
3,Satisfied with product,They were equick to deliver my order of 2 SD memory cards for my camera and the price sounded good - $12. But the shipping charges are outrageous. They charge $6 for EACH card shipped together in the same tiny box.
1,Long wait time between pictures,"I bought this card for my new Canon digital camera because SanDisk claimed it would reduce the wait time between pictures. Since I have two small children who rarely sit still for long, this was my highest priority in choosing a camera and memory card. However, this memory card actually made my camera have about twice the wait time between photos as it had with the small 16 MB card that was shipped with the camera! Very disappointed and I plan to return it tomorrow."
1,Bad bad bad,"I bought this item and i used only one day and the camera showed me that i need to change, so i put it on a card reader ant it told me that i need to format the card. It sucks a lot.Please don't buy it"
5,Reliable,I purchased 3 of these for my Nikon D50 and have not had one problem yet with all three cards. Overall speed is fine for transfers from a card reader to PC.
3,Good One,This product is just what I was looking for. Lots of free space and its an ultra. Overall 4.
5,Sandisk Ultra II secure digital memory card,I've never lost anything on a SanDisk SD card. I prefer to buy the Ultra II because they load quicker. We bought this around Thanksgiving so the price was exceptional.
5,Great for digital video,"I got the Ultra II 512MB originally with my new digital cameraand was pleased with the downloading speed. However, afterusing the video (movie) features of the new Nikon Coolpix 5900I soon found 512MB was not enough space, and bought this 1 GBcard. Same outstanding recovery speed and now I can shoot muchlonger movies before having to unload to the laptop. This extraspace came in real handy on a recent trip to Las Vegas where theCoolpix excells in night video and the lights of the Vegas stripat night are a must to record.The Ultra II gives you fast recovery speed from shot to shot andyou avoid missing shots while waiting for the card to compilethe last shot. If you use the movie funtion of your camera, Irecommend a 1GB size card."
5,"So Small, Yet So Strong...",Very pleased with this product. I switched from a 512 MB (Standard Speed) to this 1 GB high speed SD card and couldn't be happier. I use a high speed SLR camera for sports photography and the high speed card keeps up with the burst shots... Of course the downside is SanDisk released a faster card the day after I received this one (the Ultra III or something to that effect)...
2,Very fast while it lasted...,"This memory card was working great with my Canon A620 digital camera. It was really fast when taking pictures, shooting videos and transfering files to my PC. However, after one month of use it died on me. Now the camera reports a memory card error and it won't be read either with my card-reader plugged to the PC. I've always trusted Sandisk and have many products from them and this is the first time it happens. I wish it could've lasted longer, it was a joy to use. too bad!..."
5,Excellent card for an excellent price,"After buying this card 2 years ago I had no hesitation buying another. I've used it with my Dell Axim x50v for 2 years and it has worked flawlessly. Very fast speeds when transferring to and from the axim as well as on my laptop. I only truly realized the quality of this card when I attempted to use a Viking card last year on a tomtom one sat nav. I had mega problems transferring maps to the Viking card on my laptop and the tomtom device had difficulty reading it also. As soon as I popped the Sandisk card in, the maps copied without a hitch and the tomtom device worked perfectly since. I've recommended this card to my friends since and they're all very pleased with it. Great product and guaranteed safe buy - well worth the price."
4,SanDisk Quality,"I only use SanDisk products, because of the great quality. This is not the exception. It might not be the cheapest one, but you get what you've payed for. For an amateur camera, the ""ultra"" series is more than enough."
4,Lots of of space...reasonable speed,"i havesn't had a chance to attempt to fill the card yet...Spent a weekend shooting at a family reunion and took 273 pictures and the thing is only about half full. I have read other complaints about the speed at which it takes to write to the card when shooting at multiple frames per second...I find that the only delay I have is when I keep my flash on. Time delay results from flash recharge and not the memory disc. With the flash off, I can get multiple frames per second with no problem. (shooting with a Nikon D50)"
5,Great for Kindle,I am quickly buying books for my Kindle and move them to my SD card as I finish reading them the first time. No problems!
4,Nothing to grumble about !,"Good. So far nothing to grumble about. But, when you compare the price of this with its competitors, seems it's bit expensive."
4,In Response to B. Ha,"While the Ultra II is pretty darn fast, SanDisk's Extreme III is even faster. Actually, no matter what camera you have, the Extreme III is overkill... it's got faster read/write times (20 MBps vs 9/10 MBps for Ultra II) than any current digital camera is capable of.I have the Canon S2 IS as well, with a 1 GB Extreme III card in it... and it flies. I wouldn't use the Extreme III for anything but photography. It's higher read/write speed and very wide temperature range for operating make it better than the Ultra II for photography.But I'm getting an Ultra II for my Palm T|X. Overkill? Maybe... but I'd rather have the more robust card than one of the slow baseline ones... a PDA won't see the difference between the Ultra II and Extreme III... a high-end camera will.So, all that to say... Ultra II is fast, but not the fastest on the market. To my knowledge, the Extreme III is the fastest on the market."
5,No regrets.,It works. I get close to 1000 6 X 4 super fine digital photos or 55 min of digital video on this card.
1,Bad Card,"I've gone through two of these cards. They worked in the camera...unloaded it and then it died. ""Unable to format"". SanDisk support had me try several things to format and none worked. They did authorize a return."
3,its half good,okay this has got to be the worst collection of spongebob or nickelodeon ever! first of the nicktoons besket ball does not work on my 98! it say it does and it needs way to much memory as so my mom and dad said! the spongebob emploee of the month is really just easy! my 7 year old brothers take lots of enjoyment out of it. next the spongebob battle for bikinie bottom is awsome! that is a challenging game with alot of great games and graphics! and the spongebob operation crabby patty is way boring to keep me awake! all you do is go around 5 diffrent levels of 5 games! same thing except it says its a new level. i got no enjoyment and i excepted more! its not worth 20 dollars if you play only one game but that is my thought! all i am saying is that this is not a game you should consider buying! well bye!
1,did not work,When I received this item none of the discs would download the games completely and one game even said the entire game was not completely on the disc. I was extemely upset because I bought it as a xmas gift for my 6 year old and he was disappointed. So am I.
4,A Fitting Tribute,"After reading ""The Guvnor"", and managing to get through it in a matter of days, I wanted to know more about Lenny Mclean, and so bought this tribute compiled by his close friends and family. It didn't teach me a great deal about Lenny's story, but then again that isn't the purpose of this book. The people who contribute include his friends from prison, from his bare knuckle boxing career, fellow actors, and of course his wife and children. It also goes into more detail about his acting career, short as it may have been, and his final battle with cancer, which he ultimately lost, but not without facing it head-on to the end. It gives more of an insight into the man he really was, and it is a fantastic tribute to the man who was, and always will be known as ""The Guvnor."""
2,Read McLean's autobiography first,"I am a casual fan of biographies of hardcore criminals. The last book I read on the genre wasUnderboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia, and this book pales in comparison. Prior to reading ""The Guv'nor"", I knew nothing about Lenny McLean. I found ""The Guv'nor"" on Amazon during my search for a book on some of Britain's ""hardest bastards"". Mr. McLean's life is indeed worth a book or two, but I wouldn't recommend this particular book unless you're a fan of his, and have read Mr. McLean's autobiography first. ""The Guv'nor"" is too disjointed with friends, acquaintances, and anyone who may or may not have ever met Mr. McLean recounting stories. As a result, there is little progression of Mr. McLean's life. The book reads like a compilation of blog entries on an uber-fan's web site and should've best left to that forum. Supplemental material at best to the autobiographical version."
1,It lasted 10 minutes!,"I had bought the other Snoopdog stuffed toys, this came apart 10 minutes after I gave it to my dog. Where the speakers are on the toy, it came apart around the seam."
1,Motherboard DOA.,"Arrived on time, but doesn't work. Known good proc/ram from working system. Noone sells these anymore."
4,"Violence, action, and magic in a brutal dying world.","Dark Sun is being revived by the publisher and since I've been very satisfied with these modern pulp style novels in the D&D; settings I decided to read the first of the original 13 novels in this world.There's a lot of the feel of E.R. Burroughs Barsoom novels with a little bit of Dune and Ancient Egypt and the Roman Empire.The wraparound cover art gives you a good idea with the revolutionary Senator with psionic powers, an elite gladiator, a freed slave who is also a sorceress, and a mix of the weird violent humanoids with some wicked looking weapons employed by the king to keep order.The story quality is about average for this type of novel and I give it an extra star due to a strong ending and the ""The Verdant Passage"" being the kick off to a fascinating and different D&D; series."
1,[not that good]!,"Troy Denning should never have written a book. Dark Sun is fun to read, but this guy killed it. Read the Dark Sun books, but don't ever pick this one up!"
3,"Informative About Harem Life, but GROSS","I almost set this aside. I enjoyed reading about Helen, a Scottish girl abducted by pirates and sold to the Moroccan emperor and her parts of the story were interesting, but I did not enjoy the parts that were told by the midget ""eunuch"". His sexual thoughts, fantasies, and his dalliances with the harem ""hippo"" was all quite repulsive to me. I was grossed out a few times and had to scan over alot of his narratives. Had the story simply been told about Helen and in the third person, with no narratives by the ""eunuch"" I would have really enjoyed it. I felt sorry for Helen who was living the life of a prisoner with a few jewels and baubles to show for it in the privacy of her room. Truly an interesting look at harem life in the 1700s, but the midget and ""hippo"" sex was too much."
4,"A good tale, based on a true story","I was asked to read this book as a favor to a librarian because I like historical fiction. This story didn't disappoint with it's vivid descriptions of life in a harem, the brutality of the times and the interesting ""who dunnit"" that was, for me, a surprise until the end. There's a lot of sex in this book, almost too much, so if this offends you be aware."
2,Not worth the time,"I have read quite a few historical fictions, and this one is definately sub-par. It is inspired by real people, but the author herself admits that one of her main characters is based on someone who existed nearly 100 years BEFORE the events in the book. It seemed badly written and tried too hard to erotic, but ended up being repeative and gross.Definately leave this alone."
4,Incredibly enjoyable,"This book is just so much fun. It has pirates, sex, dwarves, concubines, eunuchs, torture, betrayal, lesbianism, true love, and death. It's loosely based on historical characters (in the case of Helen, extremely loosely, in the case of Microphilus slightly less so.) Briefly, a young and beautiful Scottish lass ends up in the harem of the king of Morocco, and adventures result. The characters are well-drawn and engaging, and there is a thread of terror throughout the novel- bawdy and fun as it is- realizing that the women in the harem are utterly, completely helpless, and the brutality of the society they are living in. I found the details of life in the harem fascinating, and while Helen was extremely exasperating most of the time, she does ring true as a fifteen-year-old."
5,One of Sepultura's best albums,"Every song on Schizophrenia shows how real metal is supposed to sound: Raw, fast, aggressive, and in your face. Max Cavelera's raging hateful vocals and rhythm guitar work, Igor Cavelera's (Max's brother) punishing drum work, the fusing bass of Paulo Jr. and Andreas Kiser's guitar solos just devastate you. Get this album if you're a Sepultura fan. Also check out Max's other band Soulfly, they rock too."
5,SEPULTURA DOES IT AGAIN!!!,"This is deafently older stuff, but the remastered version is worth buying, I gave it 5/5, because every track on this album is power full! If your a true SEPULRURA fan, you will add this to your collection! Troops of doom, R.I.P(Rest in pain), and To the wall are my faviorates on this album. If you like SEPULTURA, you'll love this album! And yes SEPULTURA has done it again!"
3,Not really true to its original form,"The Mission (u.k.) were one of the best post-goth bands after Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams left Sisters of Mercy. Their music was inspirational and more uplifting than Sisters. However, this ""best of"" compilation does not represent this collections music in its true original form. This album is essentially a mix of their songs from their albums stemming from their debut ""God's Own Medicine."" Truly, this album does not do the songs justice- for a better intro to this band pick up ""Sum and Substance"" However, this is a great album for a fan. The only reason it receives three stars is because the true fan will know that the original versions were much better quality then the mixed versions which exists on this album."
2,Disappointing,"Nuno is one of my favorite guitarists and overal musicians. He has more natural ability than mos. However, in his search for commercial success, he has abandoned all the inspiration that once brought out some rockin' albums. Don't get me wrong, I am not stuck in the 80's and I don't expect Nuno to be either. But, I am eager to see how Nuno has grown as a rock guitarist and overall musician, rather than the crap he is experimenting with just to fit in to modern day music circles. Population 1 is just another modern day pop/rock band that plays without any feel or emotion. There is not one song on any of teir releases that makes me want to hear it again, not one asssage, not one verse, notone riff that stands out. Overall, they are a mediocre club band with a once popular musician and kick ass guitarist as a frontman, who fails to show what he is made of becasue it is not hyp these days. No respect."
4,catchy book,"this book is really well done. keeps moving. would have liked more steamy sex scenes, this is the typical lesbo romance book - they end up making out in the last few pages."
3,Not His Best,"I felt the same way about this book as Iazza did, but I'd add that the how in this whodunit--the deed around which much of the speculation takes place (I'm attempting here not to reveal details)--was hard to follow, and then, when revealed, hardly believable."
3,This Can't Be One Of Thompson's Best,"An enjoyable read. One, however, that never really goes anywhere, and it's all pretty much ado about nothing. The climax is anything but, and the overall impression is as flaccid as one of Dali's timepieces. There's a lot more of ""gray"" than of ""noir"" about this novel."
1,the nothing man,I call it trash. How can the washington post reference Chandler and Hammett? I wish I could get a refund.
3,a book with a place...,"reading this book i realized that it wasn't what i had been expecting. every book i've read on coldfusion has started with the assumption that people are starting from scratch. this book doesn't really teach you coldfusion, it endeavors to show you how to USE coldfusion in an effective way.now, that said, the book was a little dry to read. then again, it's a book more about programming theory than anything else. this book is NOT for beginners and might actually be more suited to someone who finds themselves in a project lead position for the first time.the information is good but before you buy it make sure you know that this is the sort of book you need. in the right hands this will be very useful..."
3,"Good Book, but not for the newbie.","This book does a great job of explaining information architecture, but it is not for anyone new to dynamic web development. It makes several assumptions as to the reader's knowledge level on topics such as CodlFusion, XML, UML, etc. If you have a solid working knowledge of these areas and just want to learn n-tier, MVC architecture, then this book is for you.The book is broken down nicely into ""sections"" based on your role in the overall scheme of the project. It really is a ""something for everyone"" type book, but its terminology, phrasing, and presentation is geared for the advanced level."
3,Defective Product,"The blue memory card was not put together well.It would not insert into the Playstation machine.Took it apart.Moved things around.Fits now,and machine is reading it.Made in China...... what can you expect but poor quality more often than not.Shame quality is not high on the list for companies."
3,Decent.,"The memory cards were decent. My blue one went corrupted after first use, leaving me with just the red one. Buying one normal black one would of been the same as buying these two. Not that great of a product. Buy single black memory cards over these two."
5,Sony Finally Listened. This is the result....,"After thousands of reviews and E-mails complaining about the price of a Sony Memory Card, this little packaged was created. Included are two colored memory cards. They are made by Sony and include Magigate Technology. The only drawback is the fact that they are colored so if you like everything to match then you gotta buy the black ones. This is a great product and is a needed item if you are going to be buying a PS2. All games need a memory card to save your progress. Without one, then you will always start from the beginning of the game. I highley recomend this product as it is made by Sony and works just as well as the original."
5,Search and discovery at a reasonable price.,I have purchased memory cards locally at somewhat higher prices. I was pleasantly surprised to find them available priced as they were for two.
3,Good but not great;,"I recieved this product in good shape but when i ordered this, they said that it was erased from previous use. It was not it still had data from previous owner, but otherwise i'm satisfied with this product."
1,"What a SONY MONOPOLY, WHY NOT 256MB","This is ridiculous, this is why I hate the PS2, they have so much monopoly, nothing is compatible with it, you need to purchase like 8 of these rip off card to save your 40 games saved. or loose all your progress. why not make a 256mb, or allowed a usb traveldrive to transfer gamesaves.Ridiculous MONOPOLY. PS2 stinks because of this.two thumps down for ps2."
5,Playstation 2 Memory Card at it's best,"Somehow I just can't get why the black memory card (8mb) costs the same as these two (sometimes more!).Anyway, these two memory cards work really well. They are reliable and so far I had not lost my saved games. I don't buy the generic ones since one time I lost my saves playing a game called Star Ocean: Till the end of Time.Not only loosing your advance in a games is frustating, it can also push you away from a game, and get on your nerves."
4,Good value and usability,I was searching for official sony memory cards that were affordable. I did not want to go with a used product for something like a memory card because of potential quality issues. When I found this two pack for only $32.00 I was very pleased (ONE black card goes for $20.99!). I also like the fact that the cards come in different colors. This enabled me to give one to my daughter and now we know which card is which without an extra labeling.Recommended.
3,Paying for SONY,"These cards work great and I like the colors. My only question is whether they're worth the extra money over memory cards made by third party companies. Sony will tell you that you can't be sure the others will work properly, but I've never had a problem with the one I have. It's worth considering, especially now that so many games require a fair amount of memory for you to play them."
5,this isn't a game but memory cards,Good bargain getting 2 memory cards for barely over the price of one
3,50/50,"One of the memory cards in this package does not work. It worked once, but when we went to load the data a second time...nothing. The PS2 won't even recognize that there's a memory card in the slot. The other card works beautifully. It loads and saves data with no problems. The price is great for two memory cards and still ok for one. But, based on my experience, there's a 50/50 chance your card will work."
4,The only way to go,"Official Sony Memory cards are the only way to go. Do NOT buy third-party. I have made that mistake. They are finicky and do not last long. Also, of course they are not liscensed by Sony."
5,Two pack makes for good redundancy,Work fine. A two pack makes for more security against failures that occaisionally happen when these cards decide to get corrupted.Work great.
5,Wow this has a lot of room,This package is only for gamers with more than 20 games or who own and play more than 2 sports games simultaneously.This is not for the average gamer but if you have a dvd remote for the ps2 then you should buy this because the dvd remote takes up 2mb of the 8mb card and this package contains 2 8mb memory cards.If you own games like jak 2 and madden nfl you MUST BUY THIS BECAUSE THOSE GAMES TAKE A lot of space.NOTE:THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PS1 (THE CARD WILL NOT EVEN STAY IN THE PS1 MEMORY CARD SLOT)ALSO IF YOU PLAY PS1 GAMES ON YOUR PS2 THIS CARD IS STILL NOT COMPATIBLE BUT THERE IS A CATCH IF YOU ARE FED UP LIKE I AM OF THESE SMALL PS1 MEMORY CARDS YOU CAN BUY A PS2 CARD AND A PS1.BUT YOU MUST SAVE TO THE PS1 CARD AND WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING A FILE TRANSFER IT TO THE PS2 CARD AND WHEN OU NEED IT AGAIN JUST TRANSFER IT BACK TO THE PS1 CARD.BUT THIS WILL NOT WORK VICE VERSA!!
3,did not come as pictured,These memory cards did not come in a package as pictured. They were bubble wrapped in a plastic baggy. I'm not dissappointed it's just not what I was expecting.
5,They just plain work,I purchased this two pack when it was on sale at Amazon and saved some money over purchasing just the single black memory card. I wanted to purchase the Sony brand because I heard that other brands and other sizes (>8MB) had some errors. This pack saves me money and just plain works.It's funny how the PS2 got an update to a slimmer package and yet it still uses memory cards that are only 8MB! I could have purchased a 16GB USB flash drive for the same cost as this product!No errors or issues so far.
3,Works out fine but...,"Works out fine for the games we have at home - Rock Band, Dance Revolution and Fifa 08 all fit into one of the memories. But you can get a 32MB for almost the same price. Found that out after I received the product."
2,Be patient when ordering from Amazon.[com],"I'm certain the memory cards are fine - but Amazon[.com] had difficulties delivering the product in a timely manner. The memory cards shipped 5-days after the stated ship date. Since item was continually in ""preparing to ship"" status, I couldn't cancel the order and had to wait two weeks from the date I placed the order to receive this item. Nearly a month after the order, I'm still waiting to be credited for my return. Amazon has since revised the product page (shipping 5-7 days through Target instead of the 24 hours I was expecting)...never-the-less, too much hassle for an item in stores selling at the same price."
3,Good but not for CF type II,"The product installed and worked flawlessly on XP. Little did I know but it does not support or fit CF Type II cards like the IBM Microdrive that I bought it for. OOooooops!!! This means that I'm going to have to buy another to support my Microdrive. But it works great for my 128 and 32Mb CF Type I cards so I'm keeping it anyhow. Be sure you are using a Type I CF card and it'll work like a charm, even on XP. The beautiful thing is that I didn't need to install any drivers or anything else to get it to work, it just works."
1,Money for Nothing!,"I placed an online order, twice.Both times I was sent the product without the enclosed cd.I was told that I would receive a refund.I have not. Although the response was prompt, the outcome was negative."
3,"It is ok, but I am a bit dissapointed...","I am a bit disapointed in the ring and the service provided. The ring is very pretty, it came with a nice box, and apraisal information, but it does not look exactly like the picture shown on the site. On the picture shown, then the ring had a small curved line carved out on each side, around the 3 side stones, making it look more stylish, but on the one I recieved, the lines did not exist. Also, in the information package that was sent along with, then it said an identification number was inscribed in the inside of the band, so that the ring could be identified for insurance purposes, but again my ring did not have that number on it, it had all of the other specified inscriptions, but not that number. The producer also took forever to mail the ring. It was a good 3 weeks at least before they shipped it, after I placed my order. But when they finally sent it, it came overnight, so that was good."
5,Too early to tell,Feels good and appears to improve texture but will take 60 days to actually see results. This product is a good price for the ingredients.
5,Terrific firming Creme!,"Bought this creme for my wife, and not only does she love it but I definately love the results. Her skin looks tighter, firmer, and feels so soft like when she was younger. It has been very hard for her to find it so I started searching high and low and was a true heroe when I found it here on Amazon. It sure works for her!!!"
2,Not much in the bottle,"The serum feels nice on your face, not as nice as others but nice enough. However, I don't notice it is helping much and I've used it maybe six times at the most and it is just about gone. Each time I used enough to fill a pea and it is almost gone! Definitely won't be buying again."
4,"Classically cybertheory, Classically French","This book was recommended by a couple of artist/art critic friends who found it engrossing, but difficult to work through. (They do not have an extensive Internet/technology background, but eat French theory for breakfast.jA few years of online work and an interest in the implications of the increasing importance of tech. mediation of our environment/communication were rewarded (in my case) by Virilio's intriguing discourses--essays, really-- on how we perceive and relate to the world.The one section on the globalization of the economy, though, was so off-base, I can only attribute it to the French academic community's expertise in theory and absolute cluelessness with real life (see: French economy).-greg allen"
2,Okay as a dry/dust mop but doesn't work as a wet mop,"This mop head probably works well for dust, as advertised. I needed a mop for wet cleaning and this mop head is so clingy that you can hardly move the mop over the floor when wet. If you need to use a wet mop, buy the mop head designed for that - it works much better."
5,wonderfully accurate about the bond between woman and dog,"I could totally relate to the book ""A Pack of Two"" as my dog Max entered my life at a time when I was hurting from a failed relationship. With the love of Max I am healed and reading about how Ms. Knapp and Lucille bonded brought back many happy memories for me.Incidents that she described, not wanting to leave Lucille alone for instance was especially touching. I went through the same thing with Max. I say bravo Ms. Knapp, let us hear more about the two of you."
5,Wonderful book.,I am a fellow dog lover and this book was great. I could relate to the author in many ways. Nice to know someone out there understands dog lovers and nice to know we're not alone. Hope she has a follow up soon. Mother of 2 Wire Fox Terriers Sheila LaGesse
4,A must for dog lovers,"This is a great book for anyone who has dogs or who is thinking about having dogs. When Ms. Knapp talks about dog toys strewn about the living room floor, and dog beds where coffee tables typically are, you can feel relief that you're not the only one who obsesses. More importantly, she helps you understand why your relationship with your dog can seem so strong - and why that's okay. Her obsession can help you understand how your own obsessions develop and why they need to be understood."
4,A book that a dog lover can relate to.,"I read this book on vacation, away from my own beloved dog. I laughed with identification throughout much of the book. This may not be a book for everyone, but for those of us who are also part of a pack, it is thouroughly enjoyable."
4,Intelligent tail-wagging tale,"I read this book when my dog Friday was a puppy, and recognized myself and my fur-person in this prose. Knapp knows not only dogs, but writing. Consequently, this is a tail-wagging tale much more intelligent than most of the popular books about dog love."
5,Pack of Two : The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs,"I too have read many many books on dogs (and horses) and enjoyed them. I bought Pack of Two expecting just another ""nice"" book about dogs, but was amazed at how the author hit the nail on the head. I have a 6 year old black lab that I feel EXACTLY the same way about - even though I am in a relationship. This books will help you explain your feelings about your dog to others. It is beautifully written as well and once I started it, I couldn't put it down."
3,A good writer but the book did not hold me,"I bought PACK OF TWO because I thought the description of the book's premise: a 30-something woman without lover or family finds happiness in her dog. And I could tell by peeking at the book's end that Knapp was a bright, feeling author. But I found that as I moved through the chapters, the author made the same point over and over. If she feels that her relationship with her dog is great for most of the book -- where is the drama in that? If she questioned her attachment to her dog more, it might have been more persuasive for me.I was glad by Chapter 7 she dealt the how her pet came between she and her boyfriend in a less than healthy way. But it made me want to hear more dialogue from the boyfriend to hear his point of view of Knapp's attachment to her dog. I wanted conflict and drama -- and that isn't possible when you let only one voice speak."
3,"Read half of it, anyway...","Love your dog?So does Caroline Knapp, author of Drinking, A Love Story.This is an interesting look into the relationships people have with their canine best friends - is it normal?Caroline quotes hundreds of people and resources to defend her love for Lucille, her shepherd mix.Lucille's antics, used as illustrations throughout each chapter, are laughable - an enjoyable just-before-bedtime read, which will have you longing for the warm body of a dog at the foot of your bed, too.I did not finish the book, however, because it became monotonous. I felt I'd gotten the point, already..."
2,I have to agree with A. Breyer,"I love a good book about how we love our dogs... BUT this book just isn't a good book. She goes from being an average loving dog owner to some political dog owner nut. Not everyone believes that your dog should have a blue ribbon in obedience to be a good dog. Unfortunately, this is the type of person she basically ended up coming across as. Too bad, it could've been a really good book."
1,A psycological portrait of a person who also has a dog,"This is one of the dullest books ever. Ms Knapp must be in therapy daily. She forever tells of her phobias,problems and concers. Somewhere there is a dog. So little is said about the dog. Its all about her and this weird relationship with a dog. The book is a true waste.Why did she write this book except to talk about her anxieties>Probably worst book of the year.who would care...."
1,A wordy examiniation of needy humans and their canines,"Descriptions of mentally healthy humans and their relationships with their dogs are few and brief. Largely, Ms. Knapp's prose concentrates on people who treat dogs as if they are children or at least semi-human. She focuses on reclusive and troubled people who, having failed in normal healthy human relationships, turn to canines. Dogs are intelligent and friendly animals who try hard to please the pack leader. They are not antropomorphic little humans. Sadly, few examples of this more commonly held view exist in this book. A much better book about the human/canine relationship is ""Understanding Dogs"", by Clinton Sanders."
5,I'm not alone,"I finally realized I wasn't alone, Caroline Knapp and I share so many feelings. As I sat in my comfortable chair with my dog at my feet I wept with emotion. I thought something was wrong with me because of my obsession with my dog, now I know I'm not alone, there are many of us. This book was such a great self-help book for me as well as funny and inspirational. Thank you Caroline Knapp."
4,Often fascinating account of love,"Caroline Knapp is a fine writer, and she's written a book not too dissimilar to her ""Drinking: A Love Story"" a few years ago. Alcohol has been replaced by her love of a dog, and Knapp dissects every facet of the dog-owner relationship with skill. As a dog lover myself, I sometimes felt she got too clinical and repetitive when talking about the psychological relationship people have with dogs, and not enough about the dogs themselves. Still, Knapp has written a real page-turner, particularly for dog-lovers."
3,A new addiction for Knapp,"Caroline Knapp, author of ""Drinking: A Love Story,"" continues with her life post-alcohol in a book which could be called ""Mutt: An Obsession."" In this book, she shows she has traded one addiction (drinking) for another (her dog). She exhibits many of the same addictive traits with dog ownership that she related when writing about drinking, such as shutting out others who don't share the obsession, and comparing herself to others who are in worse shape and concluding she is normal. As a dog owner, I enjoyed reading about how over the top other owners can be. But she uses her dog as a surrogate for intimate human relationships, and attempts through this book to justify her choice. The book ultimately falls short because the author fails to completely explore the parallels to her earlier addiction."
2,A disappointment,"I've had dogs most of my life and consider myself a dog lover. I've read many good dog books and many good dog-people books. However, this book has very little to do with dogs or even one dog - the author's dog. It's really about a poor, neurotic person who latches onto a dog as a substitute for alcohol. A few years ago Ms. Knapp wrote about her alcohol addiction. Now it's a dog addiction. I'm hoping she has a life and finds something else to write about because she's not a bad writer. Too much is too much and this book is way too much."
3,I wanted to know more about Lucille,"I was drawn to this book because the cover featured a view of the back of a woman beside a pointy-eared shepherd mix. Author Caroline Knapp had written a memoir about her battle with alcoholism, called Drinking: A Love Story, and this purported to be a love story about her dog.I was hoping for a narrative telling the story of her life with this dog, Lucille. Instead, I felt like I was reading a dog version of the early episodes of Sex and the City, when various women and men on the street addressed the camera and told their personal stories.In Pack of Two, Knapp shares dozens of anecdotes about people's close bonds with their dogs. Thrown in are a few comments from people who have the attitude of ""Come on, it's just a dog."" Knapp did plenty of research and this is a pretty good book, but nothing I haven't heard before.My biggest complaint is that the pictures of Lucille at the beginning of each chapter are black and white and hard to see."
3,"Concise, but brevity causes loss of glossary","I needed a primer for biochemistry and upon Amazon search with ""primer biochemistry"" I came across this. Honestly, it hasn't proven more helpful that the chapter 1 introduction in my textbook yet. I've given 3 stars because I've yet to see how uniquely this book has supplemented my understanding, especially since there is no glossary for all the vocabulary in bold print. If I don't get something from context, I have to go elsewhere. On the other hand, it is brief, to the point, and inexpensive so I don't rate it less."
1,arrived broken in the box...,"when this thing arrived the glue holding one of the solar cells in place had broken away from the casing, leaving the cell dangling by two thin wires, I was surprised the solder held, this thing is obviously cheaply manufactured..., didn't check but if you told me it was manufactured in china of substandard parts I wouldn't be surprised, good news is Amazon promptly had the thing picked up and refunded my money..."
2,"Not as advertised, missing 12 V vehicle adapter","I just received the Wagan Tec 2053 charger. Amazon's web page states that adapters are supplied for several uses. One use mentioned is a 12 volt vehicle plug! However, the unit did not contain an adapter for this use!!!!! The manual also references a 12 volt plug!!! I would like to have known this BEFORE I bought the item!!"
2,Boat Anchor,"An affordable printer with lots of speed and No reliability. I have gone through several Brother printers in the last thirteen years and this one is the pits. Lasted only about three months. Product support is like pulling teeth...it takes several emails before you can talk to a human...then they go thru the ""is it plugged up and swithed on"" routine. I went through three layers of tech support and no luck. I figured what little I spent on this thing I may as well just chuck it. I think I will go back to an Okidata printer...I have had problems with them...but if I am not up and running I have a replacement in about four days (important if your in business). I will say the Brother DCP-1200 multifunction machine I have is very impressive...like a timex...takes a licking and keeps on printing or copying."
1,Buyer Beware,"I picked one of these a month or so ago on sale for $149. Unfortunately a recent accident with a sheet of labels destroyed the drum. Replacement drums for this unit go for $150! This surely presses the limits of the ""Gilette"" model of selling printers (give 'em the razor, overcharge them for the blades). I recycled the printer and replaced it with an HP-1022 (same capabilities, but the drum/toner cart replacements are only $50!)"
4,Good Basic Laser Printer,"This is a good, basic laser printer if you don't need color. Handles a variety of media sizes, envelopes, postcards, etc. Items fed through the top tray do tend to curl slightly, but it hasn't damaged anything thus far. If you need more functionality and have the budget for it, I would recommend one of Brothers' multifunction machines. I have a Brother MFC 3820cn at home, which I love, but it is NOT laser, which I needed at the office due to the volume of printing I do there."
4,"Excellent printer for all ""normal"" print jobs",I have been using this printer for ower a month now. Printed over 200 pgs. and the quality is excellent as is the speed.Good value for money.
4,Brother HL-5140 Laser Printer,"An ideal printer for home use, maybe even office applications. The speed is excellent, the print quality very good, and there seems to be plenty of memory for even lengthy jobs.The price is very, very competitive."
1,Astonishingly Poor Quality Control,"This computer printer was thrown in a cardboard box, without any packaging material. When I received the box, I could pick it up and hear the sounds of broken plastic pieces in the box, rolling around. This was the willful destruction of a customers order by the seller. I will NEVER purchase from them again."
4,Works like a charm,"Purchased this to replace the same model that had stopped working, plugged it in and it's as good as new! Quick shipping, and fully tested by seller were both appreciated."
4,Great cost-effective personal printer but.....,"Great cost-effective personal printer if you need to use it only lightly. If you need a heavy use machine (i.e., personal office, etc.) this printer is not the way to go. Paper has bad habit of jamming when it prints large batches and what is worse is that, many times, one needs to take the whole machine apart to fix the problem!!!"
4,update on a previous review,"I didn't appreciate this printer nearly as much as I should before I tried an inexpensive inkjet printer as an alternative. Admittedly, the 5140 driver seems fragile, and that can be frustrating. But the clarity of the print, even in draft mode (which I use for many, many intermediate printouts) and the inherent lack of smearing that a laser printer provides, make it worth the small amount of trouble.If you have problems, try this: Remove the USB from your system, hook up another printer, install it, delete the Brother drivers. Then put the Brother back on your system. If you're running XP, the system will reinstall the driver."
3,Decent personal black and white laser printer,"Print quality and print speed seem very good for a relatively low-priced black and white laser printer.My biggest complaint is that this printer sucks a lot of power when initially powering up to print. I have it connected through a surge protector with battery backup, although it is in the ""surge protection only"" plug of the protector. Every time I print the surge protector thinks the power is going out and briefly kicks into battery backup mode (it makes a beep). Other people in my office experience the same problem with this printer. One person reported noticable dimming of their lights when starting to print."
1,"If I could enter fewer than 1 stars, I would",I have a small CPA office. I bought one HL-5140 in January and another one last week. The first one died yesterday with a broken part; the second one died today after printing one page at a time. Brother HQ apologized several times and offered to send me a reconditioned printer--for the one I just bought last week.I knew the printers were disposable and that printer repair places will not work on Brother printers. But I did not expect the printer to die after a week.Luckily Best Buy is across the street so I bought two Lexmarks. I hope they will last until April 15!
5,Excellent buy!!,[[ASIN:0809237792 Contemporary's Ged Test 4: Literature and the Arts (Contemporarys Ged Satellite) I recommend it 100%.
4,The mother of all vampires,"After reading the Vampire Lestat, you have to read this book. The mother of vampires, who were introduced to in the last book, is awakened and has a plan to save humanity. And she's choosen Lestat to help her. We learn how vampires were first created. The book has to back track some to introduce some more characters, but that's great. Read the other two first. I wish I could give this book 4.75 stars, because it's a great book, but not quite as good as the first two."
3,Rice at her best.,"After years of badly written gothic soap operas, Rice finally decides to publish something halfway decent. It's good to see her using something vaguely resembling talent.However, I do have one question: What's with the god-awful book cover?"
3,Disappointing follow up,"Compared to 'The Vampire Lestat,' this story is not nearly as good. There are tons of random characters in this story that eventually come together and effect the story as a whole, but it gets confusing for quite awhile. Also, the ending of the book is a little disappointing. When the climax actually happens, you find yourself looking for extra pages. Is that all? It was kind of a let down, although Rice does a fabulous job in the sections where Lestat and Akasha are spending time together. I was really able to visualize the mass island murders. A good book, but not as good as her first two."
5,This is by far the best,"Queen of the Damned is my favorite book out of all of the Vampire Chronicle books. I love Daniel and hope to read of him in a new novel. The red-head sisters were the most captivating, even more so than Akasha. Akasha was magnificant and magestic, but not humble like Mahahat or Mekare. Lestat is very boyish and seems to, I dunno, but it is something not on the good side. I warn you now though, do not go and see the movie if you love the book, as I love this novel. The movie is littered with Hollywood *bleep* and lacks the sigficant fact that the vampires are bisexual. The movie is also riddled with the absurd thought of Lestat falling in love with Mahahat's too many greats to count child. Love plays a role in the Chronicles, but not like the way in the movie. Overall, the book rules, ... Although, I think that if I hadn't read the book and just saw the movie I would have loved it!"
2,Very Anti-climatic Book!,The first 2 books were waaaaay better! Hopefully the 4th book will be better.
3,Well..,"I give it three stars for fantastic idea & characters... but it doesn't get all 5, because you know something's wrong when a series that used to be this deep, dark, beautiful piece of literature that reached to your soul starts reminding you of DragonBall Z at every turn. Sorry Anne, it really was a great concept, but the execution wasn't my favorite. ^_^; (not to mention: don't expect it to pick up where it left off in book 2. Y'know, when it just left you hanging & ringing with energy, & you couldn't wait to get to the bookstore/library/whatever? It dies down for a looong time before getting back to Lestat..) Maybe some of you will disagree with me, it's worth a read. :D"
4,"So far, So good...","After reading Interview with a Vampire and The Vampire Lestat, I thought this series was going to decline. But after reading The Queen of the Damned, I see I have a lot to look forward to (well, i'm on to The Tale of the Body Thief which is alittle slow so far). I would definitely recommend this book to everyone."
5,Can it get any better? I guess it can!,Queen of the Damned may not be the BEST book but it certainly is very creative and it explains A LOT of things that you may not have figured out yet. You learn about other vampires and you can clear up all the confusion about there exsistence. Have fun reading!
4,Third Book of the Vampire Chronicles,"This is the third book of the Vampire Chronicles. The story is largely a re-telling of the story of the book 2, Vampire Lastat, from the point of view of the other characters. It goes beyond the build-up and climax of Lastat though and ultimately explains the origins of all vampires. The ancient queen and originator of all awakes and destroys all but Lastat and his close circle. In the end it is the ancient witches of an even older order that kill the Queen of the Damned and peace is restored.Fun read for fans and a strong close to the opening trilogy!"
3,Not as good as the movie,"The book was alright and i think it was kind of long. I didnt feel the violence and drama from the book as much as i did from the movie. Maybe thats because i didnt use my imagination enough. I don't know, but i would recommend this book to people who liked the movie but not the people who havent seen it. If it doesnt interest you from the beginning then stop otherwise your about to read a long book that possibly wont interest you. When i first saw the book in the Library, i thought whoa this is too long. But i remembered liking the movie so i gave it a chance. I'd give this book 3 stars out of 5."
3,Something was lost here,"Having read and loved Interview and Lestat, I came into this book with high expectations and found myself dissapointed. Unlike the other two which I read through quickly and quite honestly couldn't put down, I've had trouble getting through this one. It just doesn't keep my interest like the other two did. I believe Rice lost her touch a bit while writing this one."
2,I can't belive she did this,"Sorry fans. But after the books on Lestat and Louis I can't belive she wrote this dribble. Skip it. All the charaters you've grown to love behave really badly and the ""origin"" of the vampires is foolish at best"
2,Possibly Rice's worst,"The one redeeming quality this book has is the development of Lestat. The plot left very much to be desired. The book rivals Lasher for my worst of Anne Rice pick. Unfortunately, it is a must read for the rest of the Vampire Chronicles. Fortunately, Tale of the Body Thief makes the time worthwhile."
4,"Great Opener, Silly Ending","Motorcycle Vampires, Lestat and the rock band, the reawakening of Akasha and the massacre of all vampires in the world. Along with a family that traces its lineage back to Egypt and the contres of the interviewer from the first book. Great opening. Short stories mostly in which the effects of the reawakening mesmerize and captivate. Then we learn AKasha's plan. SPoiler: She wants to kill all the men in the world and figures that everything will be peaceful after that. Guess Mary, Queen of Scots and Margeret Thatcher were just waging wars and killing people because of male oppression. Soon every other character is reduced to sitting around a table holding hands and watching the proceedings. When the book hits this point, throw it in the fire. It's not getting any better"
2,Vampires turn into flying super heroes,"I have read the vampire trilogy, from ""Interview with the Vampire"" to the ""Queen of the Damned"". The best book in my opinion is the second one, ""The Vampire Lestat"", although it does have some problems. ""QOTD"" is the worst. The broody and loquacious vampires of the first 2 books turn into flying super heroes which gather in a kind of bloodsucking Justice League against the Mother of all vampires. Lestat's rock songs have awakened this Egyptian beauty contest winner from six thousand years of catatonic trance and she has the key to world peace: wipe out all men from the face of the Earth (except one percent of us, if I am not mistaken). Apart from the very weak plot, what really bothered me in ""QOTD"" was the profusion of useless characters (Pandora, Santino, Eric, etc.). They have absolutely no bearing on the story and are clearly only teasers for future vampire books."
2,An Epic in Boredom!,"Contrary to the general public, I find Anne Rice someone who got lucky with one book (Interview with the Vampire) and seemed to rehash a lot of the plot in the unnecessary Vampire Lestat. With this third book she again rehashes the first book and adds a lot of boring characters and endless subplots. I was willing to forgive the liberties that she took with the vampire legend in the first book because it was well written and had interesting characters and subplots. But this one is so boring and painful that I only had myself wishing it would end soon.The theater of the vampires and the characters there were so interesting the first telling but very boring in The Vampire Lestat. The Egyption vampires were so boring in Lestat and painful to read about in this epic of boredom.If you want to read a good vampire tale I suggest Dracula, Interview With the Vampire, or the early Stephen King novel dealing with vampires (the name escapes me now)."
4,Queen of the Damned,"Unlike Interview and Lestat, this book was harder for me to read. It took me a while to get into the ""meat"" of the story, which makes it harder for me to keep picking up the book to keep reading. It also seemed to be a slower pace than the other two, again making it harder for me to keep picking it up. However, that said, the book was quite enjoyable. I really love Lestat, and some of the other main characters were very interesting. I now have to go out and get the next book of the series. I'm hoping that book 4 will be better than the third, even though I enjoyed this book."
4,A little hard to swallow...,"But I still enjoyed it. I just found Ann Rice to be a little hard on men in this one. Seems as though she might've been having a bad ""man"" day when she wrote it. Still pretty good though."
3,Hmmmm,"I cannot deny that Anne Rice is an incredibly gifted writer. Yet for some reason it takes me forever to get through her books. They are just not page turners for me. I can go a good three weeks between readings, and then I forget where I am and it's a struggle to make sense of anything. I probably will stop after this one and not read any more Vampire Chronicles books."
2,Vampires or X-men? A waste of words!,"First let me say that I loved the first 2 books in the Vampire Chronicles and eagerly picked up the third installment (QOD). What the hell happened? The vampires now seem to have turned into the X-men! Most of the characters in the story are completely USELESS, and are probably mentioned so that Anne can write future vampire books about them! The origin of the vampires SUCKED! The ending was SO ANTI-CLIMATIC! An utter waste of words! Anne most likely was under a deal to crank out a certain number of vampire books after the smash success of Interview with the Vampire. I sincerely hope the fourth book is better.Who knows what kind of liberties the movie will take to make this story a good one."
3,A Lot of back story,"Queen of the Damned follows directly from the Vampire Lestat. But before the reader can find out who is in Lestat's coffin with him at the end of the earlier book (although it's not much of a surprise), one must traverse several chapters of back story. In fact three quarters of the book is back story.The main story is rather lifeless and I don't find Lestat an especially appealing character. The whole Rock star bit was extremely lame.The history of vampires is interesting but it reads like a history, it has no story arc, and little drama. Drama that should be supplied by the main story just isn't there."
2,"Over written, over wrought","A great example of an author not knowing when to quit.Interview and Lestat were both great fun, but in trying to give her story a universal theme [ie: the end of the whole wide world! (gasp!)], Rice completely looses the 'personal' aspects that made the earlier works work.In attempting to create a sweeping epic, Rice gets swept away in her own excess verbige, and would have profited greatly from a through re-write. Its breathtaking in the asmatic sense: everything in it is so BIG! and IMPORTANT!! that the reader simply stops caring. This book either needed to be much shorter, with 90% of its exposition excised, or much larger [a trilogy unto itself] allowing some modulation in the scream a minute pacing.Still, it does fill in some interesting blanks in the history of Rice's vampires, meriting a second star.But really, only die-hard fans need bother with this one."
5,Anne Rice's Top novel,"The QOTD damnded is absolutely haunting and unforgettable.The story of the Red-haired twins, Maharet and Mekare, is one of the most amazing parts in the novel. Lestat once again stirrs the senses to bring us this interesting tale of him and Akasha, the Queen of the Damned."
3,"Wonderful story, dreadful prose style","I tend to read a book very fast in one setting, or it lays around the coffee table for 3 months. Such was the case with Q.o.t.D. HOWEVER if you can stick it out until about 3/4 of the way through you will be in for a very interesting read as this is where the story starts to come together and get VERY engrossing!!! Anne Rice's stories are a bit like Melville's MOBY DICK in that she has excellent story lines but her colorful, drawn out prose style is occasionally painful to read. On the other hand I have and will continue to read anything she comes out with so there must be some attraction there!!!"
5,great sequel,"I loved this book, I think that this is one of the best of the series, but I haven't had a chance to read the most recent books in the series yet. It is such a stunning sequel to The Vampire Lestat, I was totally stunned by the end and the fact that it's not all about Lestat, it's about the others too. It's not nearly as arrogant as the last two. Louis is wallowing in self-pity, and Lestat is incredibly self-centered, but we can't help loving him, this book brings in the two of them, plus all of the older vampires. It was spectacular."
5,The bible to the world of vampires,"I have read almost all of the vampire chronicles, but this one is for sure my favorite. The way she explains the origin of vampires is like reading a bible, she just makes the existance of vampires scaryly believeble, incredible."
3,a lil over done?,"straight up, i'm not a huge anne rice fan. i read 'Interview', loved it, so i read 'Lestat', loved it too. but 'Queen of the Damned' killed me for the rest of the series. i found it very hard to follow. it's too busy, there's entirely too much going on, switching from story to story and narrator to narrator. i'm the type that starts reading a book, puts it down for a few days and then goes back to it, and i just couldn't do that with this book. i got lost. and frankly, i found her imagery way over done in this one. but if you're a huge fan of the first two books in the Vampire Chronicles or any of her other books, you may enjoy this one."
3,ok,"Not the best Anne Rice Vampire book. Had a lot of story history, but for an entertainment read, her other titles in the series are better."
5,The best Vampire Chronicle by far! A masterpiece!,"In Queen of the Damned, Akasha, last seen in The Vampire Lestat, has come to full power and has a heinous plan: to destroy all males who inhabit the Earth. Meanwhile, a group vampires, some old and some young, some known and some new, has met in a coven house in the foothills of California to stop Akasha. This book is the crowning glory of the Vampire Chronicles, allowing us to see deeper into Lestat, yet introducing to a slew of new people who have also received the ""Dark Gift."""
4,"Good Plot, Medriocre Characters","'Queen of The Damned''had a good plot, but the story itself was very slow. Anne Rice worte better books. And why is everyone saying it was so sexy, it didn't have that much nudity."
3,Very richly written. however very hard to follow,"Let me first say that Anne Rice is one of my most favorite authors. Queen of the Damned was very in depth and well written, however, I found it very hard to follow in the beginning and did not really understand where the story was going and what she was trying to do. As one neared the end of the book everything did start to make sense and the plot was adequate. This has been the least favorite of her books for me."
4,Better Than *The Vampire Lestat*,"I enjoyed this one much more than the _The Vampire Lestat_. Perhaps because there was a great deal more action, or perhaps because there were more familiar characters.The different voices throughout were very interesting and I must admit that I enjoyed the others more than Lestat.It would be, however, impossible not reading these last two books back-to-back, as they flow together rather seamlessly. And while I am curious as to what happens next (and I do have the next book) I think I need to take a bit of a break, as the sections that move slowly absolutely drag on and I don't really have the stamina for that right now."
4,Perhaps her best work,"This is likely the best book Anne Rice has written which, in the opinion of some, isn't saying much. I found it compelling and intriguing. I very much enjoyed it and it's predecessor's deep and fascinating history woven through our own reality. I could have done without the rock star things (or the movie)"
4,"Sensouous, yet....","The brat prince is back with a second memoir, the third in The Vampire Chronicles series. The tale is as compelling as ever, as sensuous, but I found this book to be a little more... disjointed than the others, possibly because of its 3rd person narration throughout most the first two thirds of the novel. Brilliant tale despite the confusion of the various, oft seemingly pointless, narrators on the first read.Strikingly different from Interview with the Vampire and The Vampire Lestat, nevertheless The Queen of the Damned is worth the read if you're a fan of the series. If not..."
3,a series in decline,"Alas, by this volume Rice is trying to milk this series. This time around, everything seemingly gets explained: vampire origins, what it means, etc. The characters are no longer changing, but instead are stable. While there are some wonderful new characters, the mystery is gone and so, at least for me, the fun evaporated."
3,Painful to read,I found this book to be a pain and bore to finish. I found myself considering more than once to just put the book down and skip to the next book of the series however I made myself complete this one first. The story was a complete bore until the very end of the book. The history of the vampire in this book is sooooo boooooring. I could not wait to just get this one out of the way. I have now started the Tale of the Body Thief and as of now The Queen of the Damned is the worst book in the series for me I do not understand all of the high reviews of this novel.
2,queen of the dull,"Anne Rice is a very talented writer but what happened here? The book started off great, but then it just slides downhill. The part with Baby Jenks wasn't needed, the part with Armand and Daniel was unreal in its boredom, and the part when Maharet tells her story resurrected the book from its boredom but then it cuts back to Lestat and Akasha. Read this book only if you have read the first two"
2,...,"A strange story with a plot that I couldn't really follow. There were stories from other people's POV and you can't tell if it's from a vampire or a human. And the book starts to look good when Akasha finally makes her appearance to the coven but in like two paragraphs, she dies at random when Mekare comes. The whole time, they were afraid of her and her all-powerfulness and some random vampire comes and kills her? That just makes the whole thing, well, pointless. It's an okay book because there wer some parts I did like but it really didn't make any sense."
2,Disappointing mish-mash.,"Vampires, witches, ghosts, evil spirits, curses, cannibalism, Egyptian mummies, telepathy, telekinesis. Just when you thought Anne Rice had crammed just about everything she could into a book, she throws in feminism. This book is a spirited attempt to weave what seems to be a universal theory of all paranormal experience, but unfortunately, it doesn't all hang together.The new characters weren't particularly interesting or well drawn. As always, Lestat is a fascinating character. I would have been happy if half of the mumbo-jumbo floating around this book had been exorcised and more of Lestat put in.Another thing that annoyed me was the constant, repititious use of 'the twins'. Yes, we did get that the twins were at the crux of the story, but was it necessary to mention them on almost EVERY PAGE? After a while, it became a joke to turn the page and scan for those two words."
5,Queen of The Damned review,"I thought that this book was great but I was upset with some of the content involving rape and slaughter. Besides that, I still feel that this book was Anne Rice's best yet. I would love to see more from the Vampire Chronicles. I am really happy about the upcoming movie that follows this book because Aaliyah sha'll be playing Queen Akasha."
3,A weak book but not without its merits,"First off, Mosca is far from a skilled writer. His characterizations are leaden and his dialogue and attempts at humor are somewhat trite and often embarrassing. Still one can't help but admire the positive attitude Neil and Paul maintain in face of all the odds. They seem like nice enough young men, one wishes them well, and one recommends, with reservations, this book for readers between the ages of 14 and 18. (It's too bad Alyson has allowed a lot of their early titles like this one to slip out of print in favor of the slick, politically correct stuff they're churning out now. One can't help but like books like this one - and Sakers' Act Well Your Part, Larkin's Different Love, and the Vince Lardo Gothics - despite, or perhaps because of, their weaknesses.)"
5,Gates Powergrip clamps,"These clamps are a great alternative to using traditional band clamps and make for a clean look under the hood. The only downside is removal, which requires delicate cutting so you do not damage the hose itself."
2,Questionable...,"If you wear this over your socks, the velco will constantly detach. If you wear this under your socks, make sure the socks go over the wrap on your ankle and you should be ok."
4,interesting,"i saw this book on my teacher's desk, so i bought it. i must say, as much as i like to philosophize, a lot of this was way over my head. but, on some pages, i found certain paragraphs that hit the spot."
4,Shanti,I have been wearing Keen shoes for years now and find them to have great products overall. This is my first time to get the Shanti shoe. They are light and comfortable and the have that funky look I love with all Keen products. They are much more supportive than Crocs and I anticipate that they like my previous clogs from Keen will be much more rugged and durable. I would have given them 5 stars but I found the strap of the shoe to be a little too tight over the top of my foot. Overall I love them.
5,Great Techno Music from the Past,I've been listening to Kraftwerk since Middle School. I'm 45. Great music. Takes me back. A great addition to any dance music mix.
2,Endless!,"Do you like hearing English phrases repeated ad nauseum in a German accent through a vocoder? Like bleeping videogame music?This is the album for you.I actually found this album inferior to ""Man Machine""...mostly due to the terrible song-writing on this one. But the musik is OK."
4,Unique sound,Not many people are into progressive music/electronica like this. Too bad for them. Simply close your eyes and let this take you for ride. The music is seriously different but soothing and if you let your mind flow with it you will be surprised at the journey they take you on. This is definitely for the open minded.
5,all bow to kraftwerk,"to borrow a line from wwe brett hart / they were,are & will be the best that ever was. this was the last one missing from my collection & boy was i happy to find it.everyone in the music at sum point used sum sample from kraftwerk from hip hop to trance & techno once again i say everyone bow to kraftwerk. enough said."
4,"Really, Now. From Whom Would You Rather Learn Writing?","Ray Bradbury wrote the book on writing. (Okay, okay; cheap joke, I know.) But, if you plan to learn writing from someone, who better?In the introduction to this series of essays, Bradbury dives in, ""What, you ask, does writing teach us? First and foremost, it reminds us that we are alive and that it is a gift and a privilege, not a right. We must earn life once it has been awarded us. Life asks for rewards back because it has favored us with animation.""If you want a fire lit under you and your pen, if you seek words that with draw more words out of your fingertips, this book promises to inspire just that. Just to be clear, though, this book is not a detailed, step-by-step strategy guide to how to write well. In terms of improving your writing, though this is no instruction book, I have no doubt that reading this book will inspire the practice necessary to create a good writer."
5,Guidance from a Genius,"If ever I came across an author who was a master of both the art of writing AND life, it is Ray Bradbury. This small work summarizes where his inspiration, continuing motivation, and love and excitement of life all stem from. This isn't just a book encouraging and goading beginning and long-time writers alike; Bradbury presents his philosophy for life. The two go hand-in-hand and if you haven't figured that out yet... read the book. That may be the key you're still seeking as a writer.The very way you choose to live your life affects all of your goals and dreams alike. Take charge of it all, and your writing achievements are limitless.If only I had the time to read everything this man has written. If only I could shake his hand and say, as just another admirer, ""You've figured it all out; thanks for sharing it with the rest of us."""
4,A Book On Writing By A Man Who Loves The Craft,"Ray Bradbury's ""Zen in the Art of Writing"" was first released in 1990 and his views on the psychology, philosophy and purpose of writing are still relevant, captivating and enlightening. Much like Madeleine L'Engle's book ""Walking on Water,"" highlighting the best parts is an exercise in futility as the aspiring writer would have to dip the entire book in yellow ink. Treasures wait on every page.It is interesting to read Bradbury's book hand-in-hand with Stephen King's ""On Writing."" Both books appeal to the intuitive writer as contrasted with the methodical writer, both author's love their craft and their audience, and both books are refreshingly honest. However, as King is a garrulous, yet beloved Dutch uncle, Bradbury is the writer's Delphic oracle.If the writer-[beginner] is not inspired to write after reading this short, but valuable book, maybe he had best seek another line of work."
5,Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury,"As a writer of non-fiction myself, I have recently rediscovered Bradbury. I read his science fiction before I ever started writing (forty-some years ago!)and I am delighted to be led to him again by my Fiction Writing teacher, Marshall Cook, who recommended this book. It is not only informative but also a great inspiration and aid to beginning writers as well as experienced ones. Reading this book sent me back to Amazon for MORE BRADURY!Elizabeth M. King"
5,Writing as Play,"More than any other writer, Ray Bradbury understands the concept of writing as pleasure, as play. He makes a wonderful case for the short story, imploring short-form writers to complete short stories in a day, as one cannot hold an erection for five months. His exercises are brilliant and helpful. An indispensable guide for writers who love their work."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought the book because I liked the title and admire Bradbury but somehow, I just couldn't connect to the book. Is this the book's fault? I don't know. I guess it wasn't my cup of tea."
5,Inspiring,"This book is utterly inspiring. What I love is that Bradbury shows you what it is like to be a writer and that is so helpful for someone just starting on that path. The language was highly poetic and also had a strong quality of nostaligia. Bradbury looks to his own memories and insights to color his advice. And yes, this book does have a highly Zen quality."
2,Mediocre.,"I was disappointed in this book. I found Bradbury's advice to be obvious (e.g., write for yourself, not for the money or market) and his techniques to be simplistic. He does reassure readers that good writing may take awhile to cultivate. Common sense. Perhaps this book is better for the Bradbury fan and not for the ambitious writer."
5,A Classic!,"This book has been a powerful influence in both my writing and my teaching about writing. And I'm certain several of his concepts and ideas crept into my own book about writing,The Voice of the Muse: Answering the Call to Write. Bradbury is a master storyteller and a master teacher of storytelling. Long may he write!"
1,Misleading default product image,"I admit that I was fooled by the default image, thinking it can clip a large size chip bag or cereal bag. I wanted to get clips where it was less strain to open and release. After I skimmed through some 5-star reviews versus the lower ratings, I thought that I'd be able to make Twixits work for me. I was surprised at how short the longest one was (product image uploaded) and the not-so-thick width that each clip is capable of enclosing. Thick bags like cereals, whole bean coffee packages, and chips were difficult or at times impossible to clip over after strategically folding the bag to a point to avoid any bulging of the bag. Bags as thin as bread packaging is ideal for these clips because it would fit the length of it too but I would not recommend it for bags that are any thicker. I'll be sticking to spring clips for the thick bags still. And if you must try these or physically get a hold of them to see, I saw them at IKEA the other day for a cheaper price as well."
5,Recommended!,This is product is great and works really well and I been using a whole lot less storage bags since I found these chip clips at my dollar store.They work extremely well for my special needs son since now he knows what items he is getting and they stay fresh even for months and I even use this on my cat and dog food bags and they stay fresh and delicious and they can also be use on plastic items such as bread instanst yeast flour etc. You don't be disappointment.The plastic are good quality too unless you kids get whole of them and play them like toys.Im fixing to get more of these but its been years since I brought that last sets of mine. They are so better than the traditional chip clips and I don't even like the traditional chip clips that much to begin with.I hope you find them easy fun and useful ways to use them.
4,Received quickly and in good condition. Still not sure if I like them.,I'm finding that the small ones won't work with much and the large ones are okay but they won't work with the large back of chips that we buy. Oh well....
4,Best clips I've ever used!,"These are wonderful bag clips, creating a nearly air-tight seal. My only quibble, is that I wish there was a size larger than the largest in this 27-piece batch. I do like the assortment, though -- big ones for chip-sized bags, medium ones for marshmallow-sized bags, and the small ones for sandwich-sized snack bags I take to work. I have had them for over two years, and they are still working like new. I wonder how much more they can be put through until the plastic fails. I will update my review once one bites the dust!"
5,Wonderful,These things are fantastic. From the bag of blueberries in the freezer to the bread or whatever bag you have to close they work most excellently.
5,Linden Swedeb Twixit clips,"I LOVE these clips!! I got my first ones on a visit to my sister in Switzerland and have needed/wanted more ever since. I am so glad I finally found some. They really do keep bags closed and the tiny ones are super on bread or buns. They also are easy to wash - I put them in the utensil basket in the dishwasher,"
5,Twixit Clip Bag Sealers,I looked everywhere for this type of bag sealers and could not find them. So glad that I was able to get them from amazon. They are the best for sealing any type of bag.
3,A low voltage opamp book with lots of errors,This book is more like a summary of various IEEE papers in low voltage opamp design. It's a good book to learn low voltage opamp design if you already have enough background in classic opamp. The author lists the formula but doesn't give the derivation. There are lots of errors in the examples and problems. The price is too high for a book like this.
5,Way better than the overrated ROOTS.,"In fact, the 2 arent even in the same genre (Arise = Thrash Metal > Roots = Nu Metal). Arise is Sepultura at their fiercest, most talented and creative form. Outstanding riffs populate this release as well and a true headbanger's delight.Don't listen to those kids out there saying Roots is better/their best album..their knowledge of music history obviously only goes back as far as 1996...>>"
5,ONE OF THE BEST THRASH METALS OF ALL TIME!!!,"ARISE is the finest moment from SEPULTURA...After 2 REALLY GREAT albuns like SCHIZOPHRENIA and the masterpiece BENEATH THE REMAINS, SEPULTURA create ARISE...It brings the raw fury from the jungle of the previous 2 classics with way better vocals from MAX, and the band trully shine!!!! see, i love METALLICA, SLAYER, MOTÖRHEAD, PANTERA and SEPULTURA take place as a METAL MONSTER with ARISE!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like fast furious THRASH METAL!!!! WELL DONE, SEPULTURA!!!!!"
5,THE BEST SEPULTURA ALBUM!!!,"Arise is the best Sepultura album ever...If you don't know what is Sepultura, by this cd...SEPULTURA É METAL!!!ROCK N' ROLL FAZ BEM A SAÚDE!!!God Bless Igor Cavalera(The best drummer ever)"
5,Arise,Arise is the 4th studio album by Sepultura and their 1991 release and was hailed by critics and it is not hard to understand why. On this album mixes thrash metal and death metal with great lyrics and melodies. The booklet is quite nice with great photographs of the band and contains all the lyrics. The booklet also contains well-written linernotes written by Don Kaye. The cover is very strange and I have no idea what it is supposed to represent. We also get a list of the brand of instruments that the band uses which is quite rare to be included. Allmusic gave the album 4.5/5. I give it a 5. 5/5.
4,YOUR NECK WILL HURT AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM,You will head bang throughout the whole album... Desperate Cry is the standout track!!!
1,"""""WHAT HAPPEND WITH ???""""",". . this product does NOT arrive yet to me,i'm very upset,I was awaitng to receive it few days before christmas! my money it's taken but the product does NOT arrived!! SO WHAT HAPPEND WITH IT? THEY HAVE REALLY SEND IT TO ME OR NOT? the product it's really nice 5stars, i like it a lot,...but I dont have it because of them!"
2,not so good,This is an ok album with some good thrash but if you want something heavier with more tribal drums buy ROOTS.
2,NOT SO GOOD AS PEOPLE SAY !,"THe first song is horrible, the rest has some good moments (if you like speed-of-light metal). That's all."
5,Sepultura Flying high!,"Arise is one of the greatest thrash metal records ever made. Max screams insane lyrics while Andreas destroys your neighbours brains with heavy guitars riffs. Igor is one of the greatest drummers of all time. In my opinion, Arise was the best album from Sepultura. If you like thrash metal you will love Arise. Try Chaos A.D, too."
1,Confusing and hard to understand,"As others have pointed out, this is definitely not a book for beginners. But what's worse is that its not very well written. The phrases and sentences are sometimes confusing. While some appear to be good examples, usually they are not well explained. I hate to be this harsh, but the book often has sentences for the sake of having sentences! I would not recommend this book to anyone other than someone who wants a quick reference of IS architecture. There are other books that do a better job of explaining this subject."
1,Not good for learning,"This was required reading for an online IT college course. I'm an experienced IT professional and I had a very hard time with this book. the language is very difficult to follow and the examples/illustrations only made sense after I learned the concept from other texts/websites. This isn't a book from which to learn, if you do not already understand these concepts. I did not complete the book, as it only caused frustration."
2,Too hard!,"The is the required textbook for one of my papers( i was doing Software Engineering program), I found it is hard to understand and there are few example, even if there are some examples, i just cannot understand,quite confusing! I finally gave up that paper and changed to another program :PMaybe you should find this book quite easy.It's not my cup of tea though!"
4,"If you're a 4.x CNE, buy it","Just finished another winner from Mr. Clarke. If you're a 4.x CNE, use this book for test 529. Add to that Novell's docs and either CNEQUIZER or the EXAM CRAM book (plus NetWare 5 practice) and you're good to go. I give it only 4 stars because of some irritating typos. You can get the concepts from Novell's docs, but Clarke shows you how to implement features in the real world."
1,Shame Shame Shame,"This book is so full of fluff, it is almost useless. Any existing CNE wanting to upgrade their certification to NW 5 would do well to stay away from this. The data is presented in such a way as to make it difficult to glean what is important and what is not. A waste of money for the serious certification-hound. Shame on Novell for even letting this slop out the door."
2,Want info - not to save the world,"Didn't like all the ""Let's save the World"" 300+ pages of unneed stuff. I wanted info, which was in this book, but took along time to find it. The book did include info on MMPRV and MWPRV (pg 47), but made a bigger deal about ""saving the world"" and E.S.P. (2 pages) then some important facts. Is this a tech book or a book on?Wouldn't suggest using this book as your only resource, and it's too long for a study guide.I used this book, EXAM CRAM and Self Test Software (Big Red testing software), one week of study, installing and playing with all the software (Server, CMD, DHCP/DNS, Fasttrack, NDPS, NSS, ZENWorks) passed the exam on my first try."
2,Save your money!,"Book was too long and drawn out for a certification study guide. Author's writing style was irritating after just one read. However, I purchased same author's newly published Clark Notes for Update to Netware 5 and found this guide extremely well written. Studied the book and passed exam with a score of 720 out of 800. Clark Notes helped tremendously."
2,Super fluff,"This book has 742 pages, which could have easily been whittled down to 300 pages if the author left out all the fluff. If you want to be amused and entertained, buy the book. If you simply want the facts on NetWare 5, look to another source. This book has far too much superfluous information."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the worst certification book I have ever read. The author is totally out of touch with his audience. It is written like a beginners book, yet it is supposed to help prepare current CNEs to upgrade to NetWare 5. There is nothing positive about this book. Printing it was a disgraceful waste of trees."
2,"Less annoying, but less informative","Having suffered through David Clarke's books on Netware 3 & 4, I expected more of the same with this text (i.e. technically accurate, but filled with mindless yammerings, pointless quotes and those dreadful 'Moments of Zen'). Well, someone must have complained, because there is far less filler than in his previous works. Unfortunately, there is also less technical information. Most disappointing is his nearly non-existant explaination of NSS. Also, his lab excercises seem to leave out pertinent info, and more than once I've had to go digging around other references to successfully complete the assignments.This book is passable, but no more than that. Unfortunately, I've not seen anything better than Clarke's books, at least when it comes to Novell. Fortunately, for other subjects, there's always Sybex!"
2,Written for a 9 year-old!,"The amount of fluff in this book is rather annoying. (ZEN, InfoBahn, NW5 rules the world, etc. etc. etc.) Clarke, just write about the technical aspects of the NOS and skip the childish attempts to entertain the reader. The people reading this book are already CNE's wanting to update their cert to 5.x... they don't want, nor need your poor attempts at entertainment. Had the fluff been omitted from this book, it would be a nice little 300-350 page study guide (and had a few items not been overlooked). As it is, you find yourself skimming or skipping pages due to the annoying attempts at cuteness, and possibly missing an important detail in the process. Do yourself a favor and either buy another book or purchase CNEQUIZR... you'll learn more from that practice exam than you will from this book. ..."
3,"Hyperbole abounds/ that aside, good book","Infobahn, supercar, onramp to the superhighway .. !???? All we want, Mr. Clarke, is the information needed to pass the test.In my opinion, study guides should include only that material that is necessary to pass the test for which you are studying. (unless otherwise noted) Forcing me to wade through all of the extra stuff cost you 2 stars. Otherwise, this book covers most of the information( to include the supplemental info) needed to pass. Great book without the fluff, good with it."
4,Infobahn?,"The ""information superhighway"" is a little overdone in this book. However, the study material is clear and technically accurate. The bottom line is I passed the NetWare 5 Update test with Novell's help and I didn't fall asleep while I was studying."
5,Another Great Study Guide from Clarke,"I used David Clarke's CNE Study Guides to get my NetWare 4.11 CNE. And I love them! He combines technical accuracy with real world fun! So naturally, I picked up his NetWare 5 CNE Update. I wasn't disappointed. This is a great Study Guide for existing CNEs interested in updating to NetWare 5."
2,Too much stupid fluff,"The information all seems to be here (though there are quite a lot of errors) - but why does it have to be wrapped in all this garbage about ""saving the world with NetWare 5"" and irritating descriptions of ""supercars"" and ""infobahns"".This book was supposedy written for CNEs. We don't need to be sold on NetWare - we want the hard facts with as little fuss as possible to update our skills. This book does not achieve that for me."
1,Technically Inaccurate,"I attained my CNE certification with the help of David James Clarke's CNA and CNE Study Guides. I found them accurate, readable and entertaining. Using his latest book to prepare for test 529, CNE Update to Netware 5, seemed like a natural thing to do. This book, however, is difficult to read and full of technical inaccuracies. UDP is described as ""an IPX standard"" (it's an IP standard) and CMD as ""the encapsulation of IP datagrams in UDP datagrams"" (it's IPX in UDP). The useful material in this book, all but hidden in fluff, is the same as in the student kit for course 529 and supplemental materials available from Novell's web site. This book is not representative of Mr. Clarke's ability, and seems like it was released unfinished."
5,Excellent for School,"If you have a hard time in the Oil & Gas industry and understanding the language used, this is a great book to buy. It even includes ""slang"". It made my classes a little easier to understand."
4,A hidden gem of a movie,"Actually a pretty amazing film, centered in only one setting, in and outside a cabin. It requires great writing and good acting to keep one engrossed to the end, but I found this movie to be a serious look at how people, friends, might react if confronted with this information. Those looking for slick sci-fi special-effects ""entertain me"" fare will be disappointed, as a few were in their reviews, but I was pulled in and kept in the story the entire time. If you like a movie that challenges your ideas and presents (what seems like) the impossible in a way that makes you wonder if it could be true, this is one of those movies. Enjoy."
4,"Good idea, difficult to execute well","First of all let me say that I love the idea: a man who has survived from 14,000 years ago tells his story for the first time to the academic colleagues he's about to leave.Each character represents a particular perspective: skeptic, religious type, lover, psychiatrist. It's a nice set-up and enables a wide-ranging discussion about history and humanities.Problem is, any human who survived that long wouldn't behave as the lead character behaves. Our brains are pattern-recognition machines and over time such a long-lived human would see all the clockwork of our hardwired behaviors. Such a person would feel infinitely weary, because the futility of most life would be far too apparent.Aside from this, it's a nice movie and quite atypical of American films. And worth seeing once."
3,"Good movie, NOT sci fi, with bad acting","The story line is very interesting, and there are many philosophical ideas explored. One of the deepest is the process of learning from a historical point of view.The acting is horrible. John Billingsly played a cross between your that uncle that wants you to pull your finger, and a northern Maine Hick. I guess he is supposed to be comic relief, but he achives great heights of corniness. I wanted to smack the crap out of him. I was surprised that William Katt was sub-parr. I would guess a lot of this was directing. The direction was probably was, ""Okay, each of you play some 1 dimensional cliche."" The only decent actor was David Lee Smith."
1,"Good story, so so quality","I could not watch this on my Playstation 3 because it does not support closed captioning, so I had to improvise using my laptop's DVD player. Like most DVD, I expected this would have subtitles. This in itself is very odd since the mainstream of DVDs and even blu-rays, UMD and such almost ALWAYS have these. The picture quality kept dropping in and out between fair to bad. I rated this a 1 star since the story was quite good."
4,"asks ""What If""","I tend to like 'dialog' movies, especially when they are done well. This one was. It takes place in a small cabin out in the middle of nowhere, so don't look for special effects or fancy scenery in this one. Good actors and actresses, and the dialog was, in my mind, very real. So often, these types of movies get pushed to ruin with unrealistic dialog. I am tempted to buy the screen-play.On second thought, read my review as four and one-half stars."
4,"No action, just listen and think","I rave about this movie! There is absolutely no action in it, just people having a discussion. The premise is interesting and I liked how the author told the story. Every time I watch it I still enjoy it."
5,An excellent movie,"Great theme, shot in one room with just 8-10 people could not be more gripping. I wish the dvd had subtitles (I rented this video from netflix, didn't have subtitles on it)"
4,Love this movie,I absolutely love this movie! The story is superb. The only disappointment came from the fact that there are no extras or even a main menu on the blue-ray disc. I'd still buy it knowing this but I thought that it was a little odd. I would suppose that the $10 blue-ray price might have something to do with it. I would and have recommended this movie to friends.
2,Books don't necessarily translate well into movies,"I really liked the concept. It's why I rented the movie. But the movie itself was pretty rotten. As others have said, the production value was bottom-of-the-barrel, and the acting wasn't that great either. I normally enjoy watching John Billingsley. However, in this movie, he really annoyed me.That's not entirely the actors' fault, though.I think the problem was the attempt to simply take a book and put it on screen with no adjustment for the medium. This movie is literally just a bunch of people sitting around in a cabin. They are talking. That's the action. If I were reading the dialog rather than suffering through watching it, I probably would have enjoyed the heck out of it.I was expecting something like Highlander--at least in terms of some period flashbacks. I kept waiting. But all I got was talk."
1,were all the other reviewers paid by the producer?,"I am flabbergasted by the other reviews for this movie. The acting is egregiously unconvincing, the plot line is minimal and forced and the dialogue is predictable and painful. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long while. Forget buying it; don't even waste your bandwidth downloading it for free.p.s. I was forced to give the film at least 1 star to submit this review.Update: It's been 4 years, so I gave it another chance after a friend mentioned it. I wanted to be open-minded. But it was still SO awful. People really like this? I made myself sit through about 7 minutes, but I couldn't take any more.Negative stars."
1,Boring movie EVER,"This movie is boring movie EVER. All this movie is about is the people sit in the cabin, and talk about 14,000 years old man all the way from beginning of the movie to the end of the movie.No flashback of man who went through 14,000 years.This movie would have been 5 stars if there is flashback of man who went through 14,000 years."
1,very dumb,"Let me see camera is out of focus most of the time, dark grainy picture,depressing,slow,dumb,"
4,"Good Premise, Engaging Dialogue","John Oldman is quitting his professorship and friends gather at his home to wish him a fond farewell. Pressed by his friends to explain why he's leaving, John reluctantly tells them why. He tells them the story of his life - a life he claims spans all of 14,000 years.John's story is incredible to be sure. It's intellectually challenging and often riveting, especially when he addresses matters of spirituality and religion. If you're offended by challenges to sacred beliefs, you may wish to pass this movie by. Yes, some of his friends' reactions to the story are over the top, and the movie is clearly low budget. But, frankly, I might have enjoyed it even if it had been recorded on a smart phone. The story John Oldman has to tell comes across loud and clear, the dialogue is engaging and the rental was worth every bit of my time. I like stimulating the brain cells once in awhile and this movie hit the spot."
4,If it's got to be all talk . . .,"If you're going to make a film in which the people sit around and talk, it better be really engaging conversation. They don't talk about the weather here and the premise is a bit hard to swallow, but it sucks you in. It is an object lesson in how to engage an audience in a series of revelations. It is done with a lot of skill, structured to suck you back in when you're just about to say, ""too much talk."" The writer had to know a lot of history and philosophy, I will watch this again and again . . ."
4,captivating,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS THOUGHT PROVOKING MOVIE. WHILE IT CONTAINED NO HOLLYWOOD GLITZ OR GLAMOR, IT NONTHELESS HELD MY ATTENTION WITH THE STORYLINE ALONE. SOME MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE 140,000 YEAR OLD MAN THEORY, BUT THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPLANATIONS OF HIS LIFETIME GAVE ONE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. PERHAPS THE STORY OF JESUS DID HAPPEN SIMILIAR TO WHAT WAS RELATED IN THIS STORY. AT THE VERY LEAST, IT GIVES ONE FOOD FOR THOUGHT, AND A CHANCE TO TAKE THE BLINDERS OFF ON FIRMLY ESTABLISHED THOUGHTS. AN A++"
4,Slow Pace But Worth Watching,Not everybody's cup of tea but worthwhile for real Sci-Fi buffs. Watch it alone.
4,"A good run through belief, faith, fact, reality","A great representation of how different people react to a series of mind bogling statements. To shake ones beliefs to the core, look at yourself in who you are, wonder about how it was vs. how it was told.This is a very engaging, very well written movie. Well done."
4,A very silly movie that somehow still works,"Te overall premise of this film is very stupid to say the least, but they still managed to make a gripping movie out of it that attracts the viewer's attention. It's probably simply because there is conversation between intelligent adults, mostly about history. The acting is virtually non-existent, it's just one guy talking while others are reacting and asking questions. This lecture style really aids you to just go along with the story. Not much new is said in those conversations, but a pleasant insight into history, religion and such engaging topics.Said silly premise is that a young university teacher claims to be 14 thousand years old, when saying goodbye to some of his colleagues at a farewell gathering.Again, don't be put off by the silliness of the basic idea, it's an entertaining movie for those who enjoy mental stimuli."
4,"Good story, not so good supporting characters","As another reviewer said, the supporting characters weren't so hot. Their reactions weren't all that believable given their academic backgrounds and their friendship with John.The photography wasn't great either. In the same scene, you'll have wildly different levels of grain, depending on which camera was used.The blu-ray has no extra features, or even a menu and given the quality of the video, I would say to buy either DVD or blu, depending on which is cheaper for you.It's a great what-if story that could easily have been an hour long episode of the Twilight Zone. Sort of a combination between ""The Big Chill"" and group of friends sitting around a camp fire telling ghost stories."
3,Needs a Remake,"Nice story but no magic in it, kind of dull even though it is interesting. It sort of reminds me of the Highlander. Definitely a remake would be recommended."
2,not well written or shot,"It's a very intersting concept but just below satisfactorily executed. The writing would have been better if the narrative fit in stories with detail of the man's life over the last 14,000 years; instead the main character just provides generalities of his past life or events people already know. The viewer really would have been captivated if the main character told details of history that no textbook could tell; he didn't, putting it low in the scale of interesting. Acting was fine enough to average, just not very well directed and shot. It probably would have made a good stage play."
3,Made for TV me thinks: Highlander without the swords,"Or the queen soundtrack.This is seriously Highlander, but with Conner McCloud talking crap with a demented social democratic Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez at a tea house. I would argue this is a little less deep than Highlander, which also happens to pack infinitely better special effects.If you have friends with a modicum of intelligence and banter, you are better off having a night out with them."
2,"Great concept, poor execution","The story idea that someone of ancient age walks among us is not new or original, but it is an intriguing concept pregnant with possibilities. Unfortunately, the midwives of this film delivered a stillborn.The 14,000 year old man is played with little conviction, and comes across as a whiny schmuck who's gained darn little insight into the human condition. If the film couldn't offer wisdom and inspiration, I would have settled for a little juicy gossip about what went on behind the scenes. What's the deal with Catherine the Great and her horse? Was Napoleon a cheap tipper? Did Augustus Ceasar have bed wetting issues?I don't mind a film that's all dialogue. I enjoyed ""My Dinner With Andre"". But this film's dialogue tells us little and takes us nowhere. It's a disappointing waste of time and money."
2,Could have done better with my home camera,"Although the story is OK, the movie made you feel like you were reading a book. The characters are OK, but sometimes over dramatic.I'm betting that this movie was made with a sub-standard home camcorder. The picture become highly grainy when it gets dark, and that just ruins your viewing experience."
1,A disappointment,I bought this movie on the recommendation of an acquaintance but he forgot to mention that it devolved into an anti-Christian rant. Another good idea gone bad due to bias. Thumbs down!
4,really enjoyable!,"great story - and quite good acting, too.It really makes you think about possibilities, and question what we ""know"" about history.Occassionally it gets a bit pedantic and ""intellectual"", but it always picks back up.....Let's put it this way: I was extremely tired when watching the movie, but I stayed awake, wanting to know what was coming next. That's remarkable for a movie without a great deal of ACTION. Be prepared to think, and to enjoy thinking....:)"
3,"Great Content, Poor Quality Video","I loved this movie when I saw it streamed from one of those online video rental web sites. However, when I got this DVD it was very disapointing to see the video quality. I would have given this an excellent review, however, I was expecting something very sharp for DVD and this seemed like VHS quality at best. I think the online streaming service was more clear. What was nice was the behind the scenes interviews with the cast and excellent writing of the movie in general."
5,Mind blowing. You cannot under any circumstances miss this one.,"I usually watch a tv show or a small portion of a movie while having lunch. I thought what the hell, I'd just check out this movie instead. I just about started the movie and before I knew it, I had watched the entire movie. I didn't even pause the movie to keep my plate in the sink.I can't tell you how crazy this movie is. Every person that I've shown it to, has loved it. Every person. And I've recommended it to a lot of folks.Watch it alone or with friends, it is still just as entertaining.Warning: When the movie ends you will have to face reality again...which kind of sucks."
5,Rationality at work,"People offended by critique of established christian doctrine would do well to stay away from this film. Indeed, this film takes us on a journey of one mans tale of having lived for 14,000 years. It`s a tale that will grip those whose innate curiosity will cause them to keep viewing even though the premise stretches the imagination, but I believe not such a stretch as is required for a belief in present day accepted religious magic. I give it 5 stars...6 were it possible."
4,Man from earth is great,"One of the few movies I have seen in the last thirty years that makes you think. What a wonderful idea for a play, may upset some with a closed mind, but is well written and played.Will keep you thinking about it for days afterward."
5,Brilliant!,Great film. Rented it this week-end and immediately got on Amazon to order it for my collection afterwards. I wish there were more films like this being made today.
2,overstated,"A friend excitedly recommended this movie but I found it less than exciting. The entire movie plays out in a mountain cabin and although the theme is interesting, the delivery was very slow and boring...just me I guess. Try it, you might like it."
1,Interesting but Ignorant,"Starts of very interesting but becomes the usual anti-Christian propaganda by misrepresenting scripture, history and truth. Would appeal to humanist one-world order types. Those with historical knowledge will find the blatant propaganda offensive."
2,gret concept BUT,"Wonderful concept but the execution is painful. The acting is mediocre, the directing worse. The actors seem to be reading lines not inhabiting characters. And the MUSIC! Why make a movie that is pure conversation and then bury the conversation behind loud never-ending music? Totally destroys any chance of the viewer feeling they are watching and listening to a real conversation.As well the great concept is ruined by pushing it to absurd limits. A man who has lived 14000 years - wonderful... That part is great. But this one person who just happened to have this unique whatever that keeps him alive also just happens to also be Jesus. And just happened to hang out with Van Gogh... Etc.And this man who has lived thousands of years and studied with the Buddha chooses a group of not-so-bright academics to finally tell his story? Guess he didn't learn much in all those years.Coulda been terrific but once you get past the great concept it misses it's opportunity..."
3,"Good Movie, Poor BluRay",I had never seen this movie before purchasing the BluRay.The movie is interesting and thought provoking; certainly deserving of the high IMDB rating it has.As far as the video quality - save your money and buy the standard DVD. The BluRay quality was at best mediocre - I have standard DVDs that look better than this BluRay does. I would be amazed if this BluRay offers any improvement over the standard DVD - my guess is the BluRay is a simple copy of the standard DVD. Towards the end of the movie the video was not synchronized with the audio - I have never had that happen with a BluRay.
5,WOW!!!,"This is one of the most thought provoking movies i have EVER seen!!! Even after watching it several times, i always manage to find something even more thought provoking than the previous viewing! EXCELLENT movie. Will stay on my 'Favorites' list for a long, long time."
1,Wrong description,The part number given for this item does not match the description or the picture. Stanley part #756550 is a completely different size and type of bracket.
1,Not as advertised,"The description for this item was ""Stanley Hardware 3-Inch Corner Brace, Mechanically Galvanized"". It is definitely not that. The description given and the image seemed to match, but what showed up was totally different.I would not order anything from ""acehardwareoutlet""."
1,Abysmal,"I and my six-year-old daughter -- who is delighted to play just about any game at all that's about pets -- literally threw this game away within ten minutes of turning it on. It played in black and white, but even in color this had shockingly poor graphics, sound, and games. Barbie basically doesn't move. The ""animation"" was better on the original Asteroids game (if you're old enough to remember). The only sound is a tinny tune that never changes. The games are pathetic. I cannot fully convey how lousy this was. My real rating is ZERO."
5,Favorite in the herd,"We have collected a large herd of plush bison - practically one of each of what is available - and this little guy -- like a baby bison - is so cute and is by far a favorite! Extremely relaxed, soft and huggable. It gets lots of snuggles and tossing around so is very durable as well!"
4,"tastes good, with energy","while the chocolate isnt strong, it is def pleasant tasting. There are stronger products out there but 2 of these is good for an afternoon lul. Good to have for 2PM lul."
4,CHAMPIONS STILL HAVE IT!,"I remember as a child, the whole family would sit down once a week to watch ' The Champions'. My memories of this show over the years has been of an action packed, almost supernatural thriller.I recently purchased the box set of the series and have begun to watch it and to relive those memories. I'll admit that while it doesn't seem quite as thrilling as it did when I was 10 or 11 years of age, it is stilla damn good piece of entertainment. The three leads were fabulous, I especially loved Alexandra Bastedo she was so beautiful. The plots were sometimes a little far fetched, but it was always totally believable and fun to watch.I recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoyed those 60's spy thrillers and this one has an added bonus with the three special agents having special powers, obtained when their plane crashes in Tibet, in the first episode.They don't make shows like this anymore, nowadays the special effects take over."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!,This is a completely worthless object! It does not come with any mounting hardware and is almost impossible to fit and hook up the wires!
2,microphone,"Excelent headphones, but microphone doesn't work. have tried it on 4+ computers, both macs and pcs, the computer can never detect it, even when the detachable microphone is plugged directly into the audio-in port.I bought it specifically for the detachable mic, and therefore am quite disappointed."
5,It was a Great Plant,They plant they shipped was in a container and has been well taken care of by the grower. It was having orderly growth on it and is doing well in a big pot.
1,Disgusted!!!!!!!,DID NOT receive product ordered. Did not bother to return as it would have cost me exgtra postage!!!! Buyer BEWARE!!!!!!! You may not receive correct Item from this company!!!! I DO NOT Recommend this company!!!!
3,"Not bad, but slightly repetitive","It's U.S. release with 10 tracks. In Europe both songs ""All or nothing"" and ""Dov'e l'amore"" got seperate promotion.In this case we are offered a bunch of remixes. Unfortunately, not all of them are outstanding. In fact, some of them could have been easily skipped.""All or nothing"" - the best version is delivered by Metro. The worst is called ""cherbot vocadub"" and is dreary.""Dov'e l'amore"" - 6 remixes, but quite similar. The most boring are the longest (sorry, I am not a big fan of remixes that last 7 min and longer). In my opinion the best is Moran's anthem 7"" mix.History repeats itself. The remixes of ""Believe"" also delivered in amazing number, but quality doesn't follow."
4,All Or Nothing? Dov'e L'Amore. Yes!,There are a few good mix's of All Or Nothing on here. But There is Alot of Dov'e L'Amore Mix's They are sweet. They have good R&B. I Suggest this cd if you like the song. It was totally worth $8.00. This is a Cher Collectors Item!
5,killer,This is one of the greatest thrash albums of all time. I listen to it full blast all the time
4,Their first very good album,This is a very good album. What can you expect is real good thrash music which is not ridiculous or childish and immature as in most bands. Really fast music with very good solos and melodies. This is their first good album and we know that their masterpiece is Chaos ad.
5,NON CONFORMITY IN MY INNER SELF,"Chances are most of you looking at reviews of this production are people who already own it, but are looking to find one another, the few and far between that still believe in this genre that for a very short period of time, put out music that was so much better than whats out there now, that its not even worth discussing.Beneath the Remains was such an outstanding effort. Max and Igor Calaveras were so tight, their style was virtually impossible to replicate early on, most of us wouldn't even try. Arise was another outstanding album, but this one, well, its just too good to fully express in words. The hammer ons and the speed they played at were almost secondary to the fact that they were like 16, still surviving in a very unpleasant area of Brazil, when this thing came out."
4,This explains..,"This album explains why Sepultura reached stardom in the underground scenario of metal. IT is fast-paced, authentic, full of incredible guitar riffs, a great drummer, good lyrics. Unfortunately, Cavalera's exit from the band marke their destiny. They'll never be the same."
5,Beneath the Shear Excellence,I believe this is Sepultura's best album. I love Arise but BTR is better musically. They're thrash all the way but manage to change the riffs and avoid monotony. Not many thrash bands do that. This is probably their classic. It's their Reign in Blood.
5,Igor tears up the kit!!!!!,The drums on the ablum are insane by far the best drum work Igor has every done. I love this ablum sepultura broke new ground with this one if you are a fan on sepulutra or you want to hear the best drummer in the world play at his best you have to have this ablum.
4,jungle boy thrash with the big boys now,this is the cd that most people noticed sepultura as a certified thrash band with they reminded me of slayer hellawaits a bit with this cd but they had alot more to offer.I wish they could realy clean up the recording it has alot of hiss and extra noise on it.but simply a must have for thrash fans.
4,good but not great,"the songs are pretty monotonous.I dont have the remasterd version, so i cant get a great idea of how much better it is. The guitar is awesome, but the vocals are too low, with no growl. Its what to expect before ones voice develops totally."
5,excellent product,I purchased it very recently and the quality is so excellent....i would love to purchase more if i get at the same old price....i would recomend to my friends to buy without having a second thought.
2,"Good book, but outdated.","As an entry level book to Enterprise Java Beans it was a good book, but nothing special. Currently this book (1st edition) is very much outdated because of the new EJB specs. You would do better buying another EJB book."
3,Decent starting point for transition to V5,"Making the switch over to V5 is a real pain, especially if you're a busy v4 engineer. Honestly, the best thing is to watch a few v5 video tutorials every day so you don't have to go thru the agony of a book. There's a beginner tutorial that I found helpful. Regardless, this book is task-based and spends a helpful bit of time talking about ""making the transition."" It will give a beginner an overview of the workbenches, so I'd say it's a good starting point. Here's that video tutorial link -CATIA V5 Video Tutorial CD ROM- Quickstart"
3,NOT A MAIL ORDER BRIDE BOOK As Stated !!!!!!,"I purchased this book strictly because the description on the back of the book stated the following: ""Desperate for a new life, Geneivieve trades identities with a woman chosen to be a mail-order bride"" No where in this book was there ever a mail order bride. Instead.... King Louis XIV forced marriages on his French female noble of birth ""wards"". Louis XIV was shipping them off to unsuspecting male bachelors residing in the rough French settlements of Montreal, Canada. After getting over the fact that this wasn't what I expected I decided to give it a chance and read on. Overall, it was a good book, not a keeper, not a throwaway hence my rating of 3 stars which to me is average. The story was engaging the characters were all entertaining. Would I read any other books by this author? Maybe I'll check on some of them. Would I trust what the summary on the back states? No Way. Enjoy."
2,"Super Cute, but falls apart in 30 seconds flat.","I have two 5 pound teacup poodles that are less aggressive than white bread, lol. It takes them several days to get through one rawhide bone, and they had this thing torn apart in LITERALLY 30 seconds. they had the stuffing pulled out of the ""headphones"" and the string that is supposed to be the cord unraveled almost completely. They're really cute, and we're saving them for pictures, but they'll never get to play with it. six bucks down the drain."
4,Looks Real,"This item did not came with a silver plate; it came in a brown/orange plastic plate. You can move around the food objects freely. The burger and fries looks and feel real, both objects came with the white plate seen in the picture. Buns are made from foam. Fries looks and feels stale. The coke came with a straw attached that you can't remove. The dessert came with a small spoon attached that also can't be removed. Fake foods from this manufacturer has a nauseating toxic smell."
1,False advertising,"This product is NOT what is pictured; the back is not included. Nothing here indicates that you will get only part of what you see. When I did not receive what is pictured, the seller offered me a refund, but I do not think that makes up for misrepresentation of the product."
1,dissapointing,"We bought this, because the picture showed both cusions, very dissapointing. We bought it for my rocking chair, so I could rock my newborn baby very comfortably...."
2,Metal,"After being dub, new wave, Genesis, and techno, Lydon decided to make PiL's swan song an album of riff-based heavy metal. We may never know why. By this time Lydon was becoming a self-parody, a whiney old man who hadn't realised that his time, as everybody's time must, had passed. 'Acid Drops', a rail against censorship, is entertaining enough, but the rest of the album is plain dull - grinding metal riffs with Lydon screeching over the top. The level of social commentary rarely strays beyond the 'religion makes us guilty / people should be allowed to say what they want' level, but it all sounds passionless, as if Lydon is deliberately mouthing platitudes to annoy us. Which, given that this is John Lydon, he probably is."
2,John Lydon's one trick pony show goes out with a whimper.,"That What is Not (1992) was the last disc from the John Lydon Band. Every disc Lydon made after forcing Keith Levene from the band buried the legacy of Public Image Limited further into the ground. This album buried them so deep in the world of MTV and VH1 that it was impossible for them to ever be considered a force in the pop world. Instead of defying the conventional wisdom, Lydon and his session players embraced it and became another phony band who'll forever be labled a ""college"" rock band.Lydon destroyed what the original ideals of what Public Image Limited stood for. The name lost all meaning ashe turned it into a banner for himself. With the death of P.I.L.and John Lydon reviving the Sex Pistols as an arena band during the mid-90's how far wil Lydon go in burying histarnished legacy?Bad music only for fans of Public Image Limited 3.0 (1986-1992) and ""college"" rock fans."
1,Oh no.,"After the slide of the ill fated Commercial Zone album, P.I.L balanced between a sad side show with a college 'hit' and an experimental nightmare. No more adventures. I guess the bills have to get paid somehow."
2,BORING !!!!!!,"Last and final album for this glorious band.1992.I love their more accessible period, that is to say, their latest albums like Happy ? but this one is dull, unimaginative, and sounds like it had been jammed in the studio, probably to fulfill contractual obligations ? .And god forgive me but it has a certain air of Rush (the canadian prog-metal band)to it.Even guitar god John McGeoch seems to have run out of ideas on this one. All tracks sound alike, and the prime appeal of the band to me, John Lydon's voice, is insultingly low in the mix.Nevertheless, the sound is incredibly hi-fi .For completists ONLY."
5,ONE OF THE TOP 5 BEST CD'S EVER MADE ???? (PROBABLY)),"THIS CD IS THE BEST PUT OUT BY PIL AND JOHNS VOICE NEVER SOUNDED BETTER , SAME WITH THE REST OF THE BAND.EVERY SONG IS EXCELLENT. ITS LIKE A GREATEST HITS CD AS EVERY TRACK IS THAT GOOD.I AM HOPING THE NEW CD COMING OUT NEXT WEEK IS AT LEAST 75% AS GOOD AS THIS. THAT WOULD STILL MAKE IT BETTER THAN 90% OF ANY OTHER CD'S BEING RELEASED TODAY.SIDE NOTE : I JUST RECEIVED THE NEW BURZUM CD AND I HAVE NOT HAD THE CHANCE TO HEAR IT YET."
4,Not Essential PiL ... But I Still Like It,"In their earlier years, PiL was one of the most innovative rock bands of all time. Band members left and John Lydon was the sole remaining member of the original lineup. He trudged on with various other musicians as PiL and as the years went by the music got less and less innovative. In 1992, Lydon was tired of PiL and he and the band released ""That What Is Not"" which is basically a metal album. Not his most creative leap by a long shot. There are four really strong songs on the album though and they are:Acid DropsCoveredEmperorGood ThingsThese songs work because they don't follow the usual metal rules as the other tracks do. They infuse other styles of music and that is what make them stand out. If the other tracks didn't play by the metal-by-numbers rules then ""That What Is Not"" would have been a much better album.All that said and done, I still like the album. Lydon has a lot to say but the overall music fails to spark the imagination."
5,Great drum book,"This book showed me so much about what can be done on the drums. It explains things that one might never think of or might have ideas about but never be able to put them on paper. Also comes with a brilliant CD that will make your head spin!Take a look at some of Gavin's solo stuff on youtube. He does a few lectures about metric modulation and displacement. You'll get a feel for how innovative his approach is and how challenging some of the concepts really are.This really, really changed the way I play drums and how I approach writing."
1,There is a good plot in there waiting to get out...,"This could have been a wonderful read. The elements are there: an intriguing setting, an interesting story, a variety of characters. But somewhere along the way the author lost her way. None of the characters is compelling or memorable, and their relationships to one another are seldom developed. Often, instead of dialogue, we get a lecture that could have been part of the forum rather than part of a conversation. The editing of this book was practically non-existent; a paragraph would be followed by a paragraph that was totally unrelated to what was going on in previous one. Lara's thinking-out-loud became a redundant summary of the plot so far. When the killer was revealed it was like ""huh? who is that?"" I read this for a book club, and almost all of us said we wouldn't have finished the book if we were reading it on our own. A major disappointment."
2,Too Many Characters,"Too many characters. Few of them really memorable. Hamilton doesn't describe them physically so they all run together. I had to write a chart in the front flap of the book to try to keep them straight. Also, too much of the book is Lara, the narrator, mulling over clues over and over. A bit tedious. Not a terrible book, but not great, either. Hamilton has done better."
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this for my 3 3/4 year old daughter after reading other reviews. I have found only a few software programs that are good and this one is not. She has experience with computers but this one she has had trouble with. If I could, I would return it in a minute. I agree with another review, the carrying case is terrible. I have since put it in a jewel case and have hidden it."
2,Too quiet my little one doesn't play with these,"I liked that these were wood and I also like that they are small for my little one. However, they hardly make a sound and she really doesn't play with them. Instead she uses them to beat on a a drum...not exactly the purpose of these but at least she will pick them up and use them for something I guess! =) She loves to shake all kinds of things, bottles with liquid in them, dried products in boxes, but not these little shakers."
2,Very Small,This item is very small. I thought that is would be a much better quality product. The sound is not loud enough.
4,little shakers,Best toy ever. My 7 month old loves them! They are multi-functional. Great for shaking and noise making but also for chewing. They are fantastic!
4,"Sturdy, but Very, Very Small","The Basic Beat Pair of Natural Wood Maracas are very small. I would be sure to check out their dimensions before ordering them. The product itself is well constructed and is not cheap looking, but they are very, very small."
4,good book,Great book very easy to crochet. Tried to of the projects in the books and both came out great and granddaughter loves it.
3,War for Territory,"Don't let the 3 star rating fool you, this is a good single with 3 excellent studio tracks. The 1st track Territory(4:47)is off the Chaos A.D. album, as is the 2nd track Biotech Is Godzilla(1:52). And Policia(1:47)off of both the Demon Knight Soundtrack and the later Blood-Rooted, rounds up the 3 song single. Territory is a very, very heavy song that is one of the best off of Chaos A.D. Biotech Is Godzilla is a good thrash song that sounds awesome live. While Policia is played in a way that Sepultura excels at, extremely fast. The only reason I gave this CD 3 stars is because of its length..then again it is a single."
3,Great filler in my shopping cart...,"I was annoyingly $4.00 short of free amazon shipping! So, I added this item to my shopping cart.It does smell like bananas but the smell faded away quickly. I kinda liked the smell. As for moisture, I'm use to using lotions from Olay, so this lotion did not compare. But it was definitely better than some of the cheaper lotions out in the market.Overall, this is a good item to add to your shopping cart if you need a filler. This item is great for kids because of the smell."
3,Too sweet,"I am a banana fanatic so I thought I'd give this a try. It smells great in the bottle, but when applied I found it to be way too sweet smelling for my taste. I guess I can only blame myself because this product is specifically made for children, and not a forty-something woman!"
4,Good Mary Stewart yarn,"I read this book on holiday (Thanksgiving) at an Aunt's home and while tending to her black lab I saw this book on her bookshelf. The story was a neat idea of how ESP between ""soul"" mates from the Great Beyond become reunited and because of their unique communication skills they solve a mystery that has plagued their Clan or Family Tree for years."
4,One of My Favorite Writers,"If you like interesting characters you can relate to in dramatic situations, you'll loveMary Stewart's books. She is one of the best writers in this genre!"
3,Doesn't hold up well in today's fiction market,"I ran across this book recently at the library. I had a strong memory of reading it years ago and enjoying it. The main thing I recalled was that I'd really liked the premise of a telepathic connection between two lovers who had never physically met. Unfortunately, as I read it again, after years of exposure to fast-paced movies, novels and TV shows, I found myself really impatient for the hero and her phantom lover to actually meet. For me, as a romance-novel junkie, that is when a story truly begins. Also, though the descriptions were, in and of themselves, well written, they really slowed down the action."
3,One of the better Stewart novels,"""Touch not the Cat"" is one of Mary Stewart's better novels, I enjoyed reading it twice.However compared with ""Thornyhold"" and ""The Stormy Petrel"" it's only 3 stars, the other two books deserve definitely 5 stars."
5,Taking the Bodhisattva Vow,"There are many authors who write about buddhist philosophy and religion... So if you are interrested in special teaching or special topic to read, it is always better to choose a book from author who has done a deep studies and really knows what he talks about.Bokar Rinpoche is great master who can explain necessity of takingrefuge in three Jewels followed by Bodhisattva vow in a way which is so close and easy to understand for Western people. I simply recommended this small lovely book. Its good for general overview."
2,Does not cut hair short,"I ordered this clipper from another vendor, had to send it back as it does not cut anywhere close to the listing's claims of:""blade adjusts from Size 000 (1/100 inch)"" instead it will cut at a minimum of 1/25 inch and that only on vertical hairs. Any hairs that do not stand up are cut at closer to 1/8 inch.Compared to a Philips Norelco T980 the stubble is from twice as long on standing hair to four times as long on hair laying flat.Aside from not cutting close enough for my needs I found for general hair clipping the gyroscopic forces from the motor were quite strong and the cord rather stiff."
3,"Informative, but poorly photographed","Most of the pictures taken of the snakes of the Americas were blurry and faded in color. Of course, most of us take precautions against snakes in the wild. But generally speaking, this book should be revised and republished."
4,Good all around lens,This is a good lens to have in the bag for an amateur photographer like myself. The lens is relatively fast with a constant 2.8 aperture throughout the zoom. The lens is sharp at f-stops 4 and above and workes quite well even wide open. I use it on a Nikon D50. Focusing is fast. Overall I am quite happy with the purchase. Check out pictures at[.....]
2,There aren't even real oranges in here.,"And the tea lacks a citrus-y scent unless you add water to it. When water is added, the scent and taste are slightly reminiscent of canned mandarin oranges. This tea is better than your usual Lipton tea, but only by a little: The leaves are bigger, and not as oxidized.There are no oranges in this tea, just peaches and mangoes, with natural mandarin orange flavor. As others have mentioned before, the teabags are indeed made from plastic, and if you drink with your teabags in, you risk drawing out a plastic taste in the tea. I have, and it made the rest of the tea undrinkable.Just do yourself a favor, and skip this tea. Find another brand instead of giving Lipton money for this joke of a tea."
2,"Not Tasty, and Bag not Compostable","Originally I thought the tea tasted great, but after a couple of months I started disliking it. I also started noticing a strange oily sheen at the top of my cup. When I originally reviewed this product I asked if anyone could respond regarding whether the tea ""bags"" are recyclable and/or compostable. Never got a response, but from my own experience, the bags remain intact after a couple of months in my worm compost bin. Drinking tea, especially green tea, goes hand in hand with natural products, and the use of plastic or non-biodegradable tea bags just does not fit."
4,tea,All the pyramid bag teas are delicious I drink a lot of tea and decent tea is expensive but this is a good price
4,Good Tea at Great price...,"Signed up for subscription on this because I hate running out of tea. I prefer some of the more artisan teas, but this one from lipton actually surprised me."
3,top notch,"Amazon comes through again. I wanted this particular tea and couldn't find it locally. Now I have it,lucky me. I haven't tried too many brands but why bother"
5,Best. Green Tea. Ever!,"I *love* this tea - it's delicious. There's the right delicate green tea flavor (without tasting grassy) and a gentle orange overtone. I've put it on subscribe and save, because I drink it every day. Hot in the winter, Iced in the rest of the seasons.DELICIOUS! Lipton hit a home run here! It's MUCH better than Lipton's previous traditional tea-bag version of an orange-flavored green tea.Try it. Love it."
1,Terrible tea,"Terrible tea. Very, very light and tasteless. I drink green tea all the time, and this one is much worse than the cheapest one I have ever tasted. Totally waste of money."
5,Yummy,I'm trying to replace my diet soda with tea. I've decided that artificial sweeteners are likely to be bad for my health but I drink a lot of fluids and am not a fan of water. Juice and milk are too high in calories. So I decided to drink iced tea. After months of plain iced tea I decided to start trying flavored teas after my son mistakenly used some to brew a pitcher of iced tea and I found I loved it. (He's a good kid) So I bought this and it is great! I can't tell you how happy I am to have found an alternative to diet soda that works for me without adding to my calorie count!
5,Wings and Heartstrings,In 'Opening My Wings to Fly' Tera Thomas displays a rare and rich talent for conveying deeply felt emotions with clarity and dignity. Her journey from the concrete jungle of NYC to the North Carolina forests will give you courage to follow your own heart's path. Some of the animal friends she makes along the way will stay with you long after you finish reading the book. Thomas' heartlight shines brightly through these pages and stories. A great read.
1,"Thin, outdated and overpriced","As a former contractor and consultant to the construction industry for over 35 years I must say that this book is of no value to anyone looking for more than a superficial survey of the subject of construction contract administration. Not only is the book thin on subject treatement, it is absurdly out of date. A checklist it offers was apparently written in the 1960's. Save your money."
2,POS toy,"This is a toy, and not even a good one. I do not understand the purpose of this item. The sound is almost inaudible, and it is smaller then I thought it was going to be. I would not recommend it for anyone. I only gave it 2 stars, because it kind of is accurately pictured, so if you really need it, go ahead at your own judgment."
2,only for beginners,"If you like marching, marching, marching, and then doing a couple of dance moves, then marching, marching, and marching again ... you'll like this. If you like dancing and you want some new dance exercise moves, forget it. This is BORING. It's probably a decent low-impact workout, but don't we buy these dance exercise videos so exercise WON'T be boring? Going for a power walk would be more interesting. Paula Abdul's videos are much more fun. Also I did not see hide nor hair of Denise Richards, touted as one of the ""actors"" on Amazon. I take that back, I did not see her on the video, but she is pictured on the back cover."
5,Amazing!!!,i love this product. i have kp on my legs which makes my skin extremely dry and it only takes a little bit of the gel to moisten it all day. It leaves my skin silky smooth. great product for great price
2,Not the miracle worker that I expected.,"I bought this in my ongoing quest to find a permanent solution for my KP. Long story short, I haven't seen any results. It hasn't made my KP worse, which gets a star in my book, but I have seen no positive changes. I have used it for about a month so I will reevaluate after i finish the bottle, but as it stands now - this will not be repurchased."
1,not impressed,i should have ordered a newer album. I fell in love with a song from the 'going the distance' soundtrack. this is all ...one big run on rocky sound...ehhh ahhh...same sound. I never know what song it's on. listened to it twice and have no disire to again.
4,A great intro - to a great new artist,"OK, the other three existing reviewers do a great job of detailing the sounds, nuances, influences and affect The Boxer Rebellion will have on listeners. I got an iTunes free download of a TBR song from their Union album. I loved it, then headed to Amazon to listen to more. The more I heard, the more I liked. So, what else could I do but buy both of their albums...IMHO, their second album ""Union"" has more polish and refinement than Exits. If you liked U2 when they were new, Oasis, Echo and the Bunnymen, or any other really good alternative band, you'll probably like The Boxer Rebellion. There are a lot of different sounds here, hard, edgy, even down-tempo but all cuts that feel right at home on any alternative music channel.Give Exits a try, and if you like this album, their follow-up Union is every bit as good."
2,It's just.....ok.,"This album is definitely not my fav from Boxer Rebellion. I like the sound of his voice more than what it sounded like on The Cold Still, but the overall songs aren't that great. They definitely perfected their sound on Union and The Cold Still. There are a couple of good songs, but otherwise, most of them just come off as loud noise with no direction. If you're a fan of the band, then you should get it, but if you're just getting into The Boxer Rebellion, skip this one or just come back to after you've listened to Union and The Cold Still first."
1,What a waste of money,"I bought this book but the story was way to short. I thought it would take me an hour or so to read but I was finished in about 15 minutes. I thought the ending was terrible. How could a story ever end the way this one did. Unless you get this book for free, don't even bother to pay for it. It was money wasted."
2,Sisters/Hermanas,"... The story was too easy to end, too simple. It really made mefeel sort of dumb, like I couldn't figure out the parallel between tothe girls myself. It had some good points though, and it wasn't a complete waste of time; it was only takes about thirty minutes to read anway. The fact that it was bilingual was the real reason I purchased it anyway, so I wasn't too upset with the lack of story."
2,Two Stories = Too Much,The stories are two separate ones and I think they should have been treated as such. Either the story of a young mexican hooker or the story of a girl trying out to be a cheerleader would have been better than this combination where nothing really happened anyway.
1,No Response but took the Money,"This company debited my credit card immediately and never shipped the product, nor did they respond when I contacted them 3 TIMES as to what on earth happened. Don't buy from them, EVER."
2,Weak Tea,"The Jasmine flavor is weak when you make an 8 ounce cup brewed for 3 minutes. Brew longer and it turns bitter. For me, the best Jasmine tea in bags is Jasmine Green, Organic Monkey King by NUMI."
3,Not sealed teabags,I tried these out since they are alot of foojoy teas in this one store i frequent but the teas have no flavor cause it all seeps out since the teabags aren't aluminum sealed. The sampler teas they have were sealed and have way superior flavor. I suggest people look at the Yamamotoyama brand instead since they do seal their teabags.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this jasmine green tea as I could not detect any jasmine flavor or smell.
3,Eight Volumes?,"Das Kapital has only 3 volumes, or 4 if you consider the historic volume.According to the sample, this ebook is only Volume 1, with its 8 PARTS (Part I to Part 8)."
3,Entertaining for a while..,"My girls are 3 and 5 and had a hard time with this game.There are several areas that require skills above them.They did enjoy the other parts of the game, but once they finished they didn't really want to play again."
2,Kindle edition riddled with typos...,"NOTE: This review for Kindle edition only.Jefferson DavisLooking at the Kindle ""sample"", the introduction and first chapter are full of words that have been joined without a space. Either the OCR was on the fritz or, if typed, the space bar was."
3,Very agressive consumer advocate,"As a consumer I know what it feels to be pushed into a corner by a business not interested in resolving my complaints though I have not had to resort to the type of tactics the author describes to get results. The book contains new ways of dealing with difficult busineses and I plan to file it away under the category of ""When all else fails."" While friends and family describe me as ""assertive"" in general I do not think women in general would be willing to put themselves in such an antagonistic position.The book's voice comes across somewhat harsh and quarrelsome mixed with pride of accomplishment. The writing gets caught up in circular-references and tends to repeat too much for me."
5,What Every Consumer Needs to Know,This book is something that should be on the shelf in every home in America. It's disgusting the way companies treat us and even more disgusting to me that people put up with it! This book will show you how to get satisfaction in any possible situation when you have been ripped off and/or a victim or horrendous customer service.
1,Consumer advocate or terrorist?,"This guy is not a lawyer; according to the Miami Herald, he is a consumer terrorist. I would tend to agree with that since I have been a victim of his highhanded tactics. There is nothing wrong with the consumerist movement until it tramples undeservedly on the rights and reputations of others. My company was blackmailed by this guy, we paid the ransom, but he killed the hostage anyway! Is that the kind of consumer advocacy you want to be associated with?If you have legitimate complaints with a business or individual, you have recourse to the justice system, including small claims court. If you can't afford an attorney, most every community has a legal aid office or attorneys who provide services pro bono."
2,"Jungle Hammock, a Bit Tight","I have been looking forward to trying this product out for a long time. Searched several vendors and this was definately the best price. The hammock seems very functional, the fault I find is that when I slept in it the first night it was just too tight. I am not a extra ordinarily large guy, 6'2' about 200lbs but this hammock just needs to be wider and longer by about 6"" each to really make a decent night sleep. While a shorter person may benefit more I find this a bit small for a good night's rest."
5,Should Be In Print!,"I read this book in the late 70's, and fully agree with T.M. Wish I could get it, without paying a fortune; (I did download a digital version but still want a hard copy for my library I'm trying to rebuild, from when I owned some very valuable pioneering works like this.) I agree that it is a little dry to wade through-(thought it was just me!)-but oh, if people only knew how all this drug madness evolved, it would light a fire under many to free themselves from the slavery to this dead-end therapy, and learn how health is actually restored and built in the body! (N.W. Walker's books would be a great resource, though ""dated"", for an intelligent person. I say this, not because his books are hard to understand, but due to the ""dumbing down"" of America in recent decades, and because of my familiarity with books published in the 70's, more than current ones.)"
3,A fair stab,"A fair stab at more agressive metal sound. FLA always has at least a few irresistible tracks for more than one exact taste. Parts of the album sound forced, but FLA fans as a whole shouldn't hesitate."
3,"Ever see the movie ""Falling Down?""","That's sort of the tone that this disc has. ""Vigilante,"" in fact, samples a few belligerent oaths uttered by the wacked-out Michael Douglas in that Hollywood I-hate-PCism flick. It's 1994, and the U.S. is steeped in the culture wars and climbing out of recession and Bush-era pessimism. It's the year when lots of bands buy into the rap-meets-metal genre (started a few years earlier by P.E. and Anthrax with Bring Tha Noize?), including the now oh-so-dated Rage Against the Machine, and FLA makes a brief departure from their spooky ambience to crunching guitar riffs without re-examining their ever-dorky lyrics. But, industrial is industrial."
5,perfect,"The best doc of this type I've seen & I've seen them all,I enjoy doc's about movies especially exploitation/b movies that I have no interest seeing,but I like seeing movies about them."
5,Fun way for kids to learn Chinese,My daughter Lily is already wearing this video out. Mei Mei's upbeat and entertaining video makes learning Chinese fun for kids.
4,Not bad....,"I give this gum four stars for a few reasons. First off, if the gum gets a little bit cold they are hard as rocks. Even when at room temp they are kind of hard. One is definitely too small for myself, and others that have tried them, so two is the norm now... not really a negative, just an observation And another reason is I turn the tin over to get a piece or two of gum, and most are cracked or the corners broken... not a big deal, but when the little crumbs get all over your car or desk, it's annoying.The gum itself tastes great, is sugar free, the taste will last (in my opinion) about the same as or more than Orbit... and the bonus is that it contains caffeine. I'm not trying to be too negative here, the tin is cool, the gum is made in the US by a smaller company and I will definitely buy again and I do highly recommend this product."
5,PERFECT ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION OF KITSCH,USE FOR STAGING ON BAR DESIGN. GREAT ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION OF STAGING ITEMS FOR DISPLAY ONLY.ALOS HAVE THE RED WINE AND GRAPES
3,Not like drainer boards of yesteryear.,This dish drainer board is not like the ones they made years ago. Very thin. Not many colors to pick from.
2,Water sits on it til I put the dishes away. then I drain and dry the board,I am using this one but I find that the slant is not high enough and the water does not drain into the sink. I have had to put things under the board to create higher slant so that the water will move and drain into the sink. Not too happy with this one.
3,Will do for now,"Been looking long for this style, but the feet on the bottom are not angled enough to keep the board drained fix that and it""s 5 star"
2,Flat drainer,"This product is much too thin and too flat. Should have a raised, back edge so water drains off of it."
3,Large Dish Drainer Board,I was not that happy with the product. The plastic was very thin so I don't expect it to last very long; especially since water will be sitting on the board all the time.
4,Dish Drainer Board,"I purchased this product to replace another one that had worn out. I thought the new one was the same, as the photos looked the same and they are made by the same company. However, the new one is considerably flimsier though it does the job intended."
4,Great Price,"Company was on time, very responsive. Offered great price for product. I would reccomend doing business with this company, as I will in the future."
2,Inaccurate measurements. Not large enough.,"The measurements are inaccurate. It's not 1.25"" in height (more like 1"") and is only 18.5"" in length (with a 1.5"" lip). It will NOT fit a dish drying rack that is 20"" in length. And the tilt-gradation is not significant at all. The material is also a fairly flimsy plastic."
3,plastic dish drain board- large,"This dish drain board is very thin. I was expecting it to be about a 1/4 of an inch thick. It's thinner, so I'm using it on top or my old one. My thicker old one is more rigid and has a slope to help the water drain off. I'm still looking for a large thicker drain board. I've only seen small square ones in the stores."
4,It is better than our old Rubber Maid drainer,"At first I was leary about this drain board, but it works well. It is easier to keep clean then our old Rubber Maid, which I had to scrub with COMET to get the stains out. Yes it lighter then our old Rubber Maid drain board but is is strong enough had ours over a year with no problems."
3,Dish drain board,"I received this product within 3 days of ordering!! Very fast service and in very good condition. The only problem is that I ordered a large but it's not as large as I would like it. I would of liked it a little longer, but it doess the job and drains where it is suppose to, in the sink."
2,Warped within 3 months; now does not drain,"This is a fairly lightweight drainboard compared to others that I've bought over the years. It's a relatively thin, flexible plastic, and not the substantial, rubber-like material that I'm used to. It worked OK at first but within 3 months of normal use in a small household the ""spillway"" has bowed upwards and it no longer drains. Unfortunately, it seems to be a classic example of ""they don't make them like they used to"". I used to get years of use from a drainboard, not months."
4,Dish drainer,"The product appears very sturdy and, unlike most other dish drainers, has a much needed sideways drain, as opposed to the more typical front facing ones. Perfect size for my existing metal dish rack."
2,It is large enough,"I was disappointed when Rubbermaid stopped making their drainboard. Size is good and it works. I don't think it will last anywhere as long as the Rubbermaid drainboard did. It was cheap enough so if it doesn't last, I'll get another. I don't care for plastic."
1,Flimsy and unusable,"Bought to replace a worn-out Rubbermaid drainer board. From the picture I expected something heavy-duty enough to use. This was very thin, flimsy plastic (not rubber), unable to hold the weight of an empty drainer, totally unusable. Don't buy, a total waste of money."
2,Better Houseware Large Drainer Board White,"the drainer board is to flimsy forms water puddles will not drain, the one I had before was made by rubbermaid. I have had it about 20 years was a very good drainer board was so disappointed with this one. will keep looking for a better one. Hope there is one out there somewhereDonna Horton"
4,It works.,It is a little flimsy and a little bigger then I needed but it works and I'm happy with it. I don't know why Rubbermaid doesn't make them anymore but it is what it is. I'm happy.
3,Average Drain board,The material is a little on the flimsy side and is not made in such a way that it drains well. Keep looking for a better one.
1,dish drainer,"I was not very happy with this dish drainer. It is very thin plastic, not as sturdy as the one I had previously which was made my Rubbermaid.I kept it because it was the right size and the drain part emptied from the long side of the drainer which met my needs.It was also twice as much money as the other drains."
1,Drain that doesn't drain,"This is a ""drain"" without sufficient pitch. Probably would work for an undermount sink, but useless for a top mount."
4,Okay,"I wanted a replacement for my old drainer, which was stained and scratched. This was the only end drainer I could find that was large enough. My old one was really heavy, flexible material. This is lighter, but brittle. It's acceptable, but I like my old one better."
4,Tenative Review. Time will tell,"This is one of those products which it seems the ""Big Name"" Rubbermaid doesn't even make any longer. I bought it to replace a Rubbermaid product which had been in place for perhaps decades. It's only failing seemed to be that it stained to easily, and was hard to clean. Some people have said this product is too rigid. I am hoping that is a bonus, as the harder plastic may not stain, and may be easier to clean than the soft Rubbermaid. As long as it sits there and does nothing but hold glass and crockery off the hard porcelain of the sink, it seems to be working just fine.Time will tell if this board resists staining and is easier to clean. If not, I may dock it a star."
3,Drain Board,The product is okay. Too flimsy and not sturdy enough compared to other drain boards made by tupperware. That's it.
3,needs to be bigger!,Its too soft and too pliable. Its the biggest out there. New design is on my bucket list. Stay tuned.
3,Useful but only one color,The only thing I found wrong with drainer board that no matter I could only get it white And I had to eventually change the rest of utensils because of that
2,It's OK,"It does the job. But, the quality is definitely Chinese and not American. Cheapo hard plastic. If only Rubbermaid had the dimensions!"
3,Not what they used to be...,"I was looking for a drain board that drained on the shorter side of the board. Of course they don't make these anymore, only the ones that drain on the long side. Happened to find this one on Amazon and on a few other sites and bought it off here because it was cheaper. When it came, I wished I hadn't bought it. The quality is no good. Didn't these things used to be made of sturdy plastic? This one is flimsy and cheap. I can't even lift the drain board with the dish rack on it like I did my old one because when I did the drain board would curl and the dish rack would start rocking. I settled for it anyway because I needed one, but I'm still looking for something better."
3,"dish drainer, not really as described","The dish drainer has a good shape and lip design. It was advertised as heavy duty, soft, plastic. However, it's not particularly soft, not particularly sturdy, and the water gathers in the middle...."
1,Not correct dimensions,"This is listed as 20"" long, but my 19.75"" long Ikea drying rack did not fit in it so I re-measured and it is only 18.5"" long unless you count the lip part that allows water to drain into the sink... then it is closer to 19.5"". Either way, not correct so I am returning."
1,Doesn't drain,"I bought this because the ""drain end"" was on the short side of the drainer, as opposed to the long side.The problem - this thing is cheap and the weight of just 1 or 2 dishes on the rack is enough to flatten it and prevent it from draining. There is no elevation to this at all, and the water just sits in it until you physically life it up to drain it, which defies the point..."
1,Add My Complaints to the List,"I bought it for the same reason as everyone else--I needed a large draining board with the opening on the short side. Because I had looked just about everywhere else with no success, I didn't mind the high price + shipping total (hey, it's a seller's market). But I was extremely disappointed at the lack of quality. It's stiff, relatively thin, and arrived bowed in the middle of the drain area, which prevents water from exiting the pan unless I left it at the other end... which, as others have noted, cannot be done if there are any dishes in the drainer... the pan's just not sturdy enough. Because of the afore-mentioned lack of draining, the pan constantly requires washing itself to clean off the mold or whatever it is that likes to grow in wet drain pans."
1,EXACTLY like clear drainboard also on Amazon,"This drainboard is exactly the same as the clear one (except the color) but this white one was much less expensive when I purchased them both. I ordered both in hopes that the clear one was sturdier since it was more expensive but they are both identically flimsy. However, since they are the only side-drain styled drainboards I could find I'm stuck. I did keep the white one and return the clear one."
3,Not As Good As Her Other Stories,"If you have read 'In Bed With the Boss', you will find this book disappointing. The story is lame and contrived. I just can't stomach the idea that a father wants a grandson desperately enough to trick his own son into donating his sperms and then strikes a bargain with a young woman to have his grandson by artificial insemination. Meanwhile, in order to give the baby his name, he marries the woman. Although this is a sham marriage, the whole thing appears somehow stilted and sickening, especially with the 'stepson' finding out and wanting to consummate the 'marriage'. This is nowhere near 'Nobody's Baby But Mine' by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, which is sexy, homorous and fun."
3,Interesting,"Back Cover description: Jennifer had taken drastic measures to become pregnant, and she was saving every ounce of love she had for her baby. There was no room in her life for marriage--but now the father of her unborn child had arrived on her doorstep! Jennifer's first problem was that her entire family believed Raphael Jordan was actually her husband--and that, at last, the happy couple could have a honeymoon! Her second was that Raphael was delighted to oblige...so Jennifer was forced to share a bed with her gorgeous, sexy, pretend husband!I liked this book. The story was unusual and interesting. She was tricked. Jennifer got married because she thought she was helping a dying man, and in return he would help her have a baby by invitro. She was set up. Her husband used his son's sperm to get a grandchild. The son thought he had been setup. Good interplay between the characters and the plot moves along nicely"
5,Great book,"I really like this book. I am a school psychologist and was struggling with how to help a group of hyperactive and impulsive boys that I have. I was spending much of my session time with them trying to get them focused and in control of themselves so I knew that I needed another approach. I decided to give this book a try and they love it. We have just started making remote controls with products that I got at the crafts store. While we haven't gotten too far into it, the boys really liked the story about Hunter and were able to tell me almost everything about the story and the buttons on his remote a week after we read it. I recommend this book to anyone who is working with students that struggle with self regulation and control."
5,at long last,"finally - the best ever series on the Cold War on dvd. I watched this on tv some years ago and wore out my home made vhs tapes of the series after repeated viewing. As far as I can see - pretty much every aspect of the Cold War period is dealt with in fair detail. If you want more - Vietnam for example - you have series like VIETNAM - A TELEVISION HISTORY - so its quite like THE WORLD AT WAR in that regard. I found the last couple of episodes on the collapse of communism and the USSR of particular interest. Again like THE WORLD AT WAR, the interviews with old participants - such as Mikhail Gorbachev - are fascinating. This is tv history as it should be. Brilliant."
5,Briilliant,"I was dubious about buying this as it was from CNN. I was expecting the normal bang crash, sensationalist presentation that even the BBC does these days. However, what I got was a well presented, rational and entertaining documentary (not a mockumentary so loved of the shot away sound engineers of today). This set of programmes shows how it should be done. It covers almost everything in a relatively objective manner and shows both perspectives of the Cold War. Excellent value - more like this please. I know it was made in 1998 but contemporary programme developers could learn a huge amount from watching this and trying to emulate it."
5,CNN Cold War Series,"I have this series in VHS though most of the tapes are now in pretty bad shape. I noticed that this series will be available on DVD but some had questioned whether the DVD series would be the original or would two of the tapes not be included due to U.S. Government security concerns with regards to Afghanistan. If this is the complete series, I would gladly purchase it but doubt if I will if it is ""sliced & diced"". Anyone have advanced information on this upcoming DVD copy? Thank you in advance,"
3,I was upset at this book,"We had to read this book at school,and I absoultly hated it.I know half of the people who read this book will love it,and others may not. This isn't my style of book,but it taught some very important values to kids.So please,don't respond to this flaming,but this book could not contain my attention half the time.Some parts were amazing,in which I was highly interested,but many parts dragging out for so long.But overall for most this book is great,just not for me."
5,Neat Karaoke machine,"This is a cool karaoke machine, it has the wireless headphones that you plug in, the only thing I personally don't like is that you have to have batteries to run the headphones. So I am going to purchase a diffrent microphone for it. It has a larger jack for the microphone like one you would use to plug into a Pa system.you have to buy the CD& graphics CD's if you want to see the words and sing along with it. But you can also just play any cd and raise the voice control and sing with it.when you do that the music kind of get's a little lower but if your using this just for recreation then it's ok.This one does not cancel out the vocals on cd's."
4,"Race, Class, and Truth","The character of Booker Short is at the heart of this story. A young black male burdened with the weight of familial history. Through his encounter with his Grandfather's former commanding officer and his relationship with the daughter of a prominent judge , he explores issues of race, class, identity and ultimately learns about the complexity of truth according to perspective.Very good book. Terrell writes nice sentences and the character development is good. The plot bogs down a bit and the relationship between the judge's daughter and Booker is somewhat unbelievable. Recommended."
3,Great,The author is my language arts teacher and I was surprised to find this book. It really captures how she is.
3,Spastic Elastic,"I have several pairs of these. Great fabric and comfortable, but the elastic band doesn't last. In a few months all the elastic bands have gone wavy to varying degrees (they still work though). You know what I mean... when something lets loose in the elastic and the band gets all wavy instead of nice and flat. For what these cost I wouldn't expect that to happen. It's too bad because they really have the best fabric I've found so far."
4,The audio version is not good,"I've always been a loyal fan of LH. ""Sarah's child"" is good but the audio version is not a plus of it. DO NOT BUY THIS AUDIO VERSION!"
5,A must read!!,"If your are looking a strong woman and strong man this is your story. Nora makes you feel her characters pain, joy and love. Sarah and Rome become more than characters on a page in a book, they become people you want, no need to be involved in thier lives.This love story is so compelling that you can't put it down. I have been a fan ever since."
5,"Loved the story, but hated the audio version!","I loved the story, but the audio version was so bad, I had to force myself to listen to the whole thing. Now that the book has been reissued, by all means, read the book but stay away from the audio."
4,A Winner!,"This was the first of Linda Howard's books which I read. I have since become an avid fan of this author! I recommend to any and all to read this story and fall in love with the characters, which is something you get a chance to do with ALL of Linda Howard's books"
4,Sarah's Child was her husband!,"Linda Howard writes such great strong, virile male characters, but this one (Rome) might have been just a little bit too selfish. Yes, he had suffered the loss of his wife and 2 small sons, but he certainly didn't have much trouble replacing his wife with Sarah. But, when Sarah gets pregnant, he wants her to have an abortion, and barring that, to keep the inconvenient baby away from him. She went through her whole pregnancy alone, without any support from him, and after the baby was born, he couldn't be bothered to acknowledge the child.Still, I liked the story because obviously he was going to come around, and I liked how Rome and Sarah fell in love and became so important to each other. I can see many would be put off by Rome's selfishness, though.All in all, I liked it."
2,not quite up to snuff,"Although I usually enjoy Linda Howard's books, I found this one to be thin and repetetive. Ok Sarah had blond hair, enough already. That said, there were other details which were just missing, like anything to do with setting. They lived in Houston, but it could have been anywhere as this had absolutely nothing to do with the story. Usually Howard's books have a setting much more integral to the plot which is why I like them.I guess since this is an older book that some of the well worn flowery stock romance phrases have an excuse but they still bothered me.An ok book but I'm glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it."
3,INTERESTING PAGE TURNER BUT....,"I have to agree with ""Eye Rolls."" Linda Howard is my very favorite author and I had to finish this book in one reading but I did have some problems with the two characters. First, even though he had suffered a tragedy, there was no excuse for Rome to be so verbally abusive towards Sarah. Sarah was way too understanding and had no backbone whatsoever. I kept reading the book in hope that some fiestiness like Howard's usual characters would appear. I was actually hoping Sarah would get with Max. An no woman should tolerate a spouse ignoring her child. Overall, an interesting read with some needed changes in characterization."
2,egh.,"i've liked other books by L Howard, but this was a waste of my time. I really wish I hadn't read it. Totally cliche plot and poor character development. Plus, it reads like it was written in the late 70s/early 80s, so it's got that whole ""virile"" bossman/weak but beautiful secretary thing happening. Giving it 2 stars because Linda Howard at least always comes through in terms of phrasing, pacing, grammar, etc., so it isn't painful to read...except for all the other ways it's painful to read. Yikes. Pass this one up."
4,"Good, cathartic read","Some parts of this were too close to home and I cried through a lot of this book. I agree that there sides to the characters that seem overboard/overly dramatic, but frankly there are all kinds of people out there with different life experiences/maturity levels/education levels/cultural beliefs... If you've lost a child or husband, etc, in the last few years, I'd advise you select a different book. Just sayin'. It does have a happy ending, though. Why else would we read these books, right? :)"
1,Pathetic,"Rome is the most pathetic excuse for a ""hero"" that Howard has ever written.Whine, whine, whine. ""I have been hurt. Oh, poor me. No one in the history of the world has ever been hurt like I have. Everyone must spend the rest of their lives making certain that I never have to suffer again.""One question, Rome: If you were so damn certain that you NEVER wanted to have a child again, then WHY didn't you get a vasectomy, you selfish moron?Instead, you put all the responsibility off on the woman you married because you wanted regular sex.Pig.Not that Sarah's much better. Lusting after your best friend's husband? Saving your virginity for him? Allowing him to ignore YOUR precious child?What if Rome never ""saw the light""? How long was Sarah going to stay with a man who would mentally and emotionally abuse her baby?"
2,Something Lacking -- Least favorite of Linda Howard Books,"I'm a big Linda Howard fan. But I found myself very unsatisfied with Sarah's child. While the plot was okay, I found Rome's complete self-absorbtion to be a real turn-off. And while I liked Sarah for standing for her convictions in some parts of the book, I kept waiting for her to call Rome on being the selfish jerk he was. I was really disappointed in this book and glad that I checked it out from the Library rather than buying it."
1,Sarah's patience amazes me!,"In the real world a woman would give Rome a kick in ****. The man doesn't make an effort to change until he is forced into a situation. He says he loves her, but then again I didn't see love, only a whole lot of lust. And if my husband lusted after a woman when he was married to me, it would be just as bad as adultery. Sorry Linda Howard but women shouldn't be treated as doormats, especially in books. It happens often enough in the real world."
1,I hated the hero in this book,"I read this book long ago but I still remember how I hated this book. This was the second Linda Howard book that I hated with a vengeance (the other was 'Independent Wife'). This book seems to be one of those 'hate it' or 'love it' books and it shows Linda Howard's writing ability to be able to pull off that kind of emotional reaction from her readers. In this book, Linda Howard asked a question of ""How long should we allow ourselves to grieve?"". The grieving person in this book was Rome. Unfortunately I could not find myself sympathize with Rome at all because throughout the book his treatment to Sarah left me cold. Rome was cold, selfish, and all he cared about was sex with Sarah without giving any thought to her needs. Thank God I didn't start Linda Howard with this book or I wouldn't have continued reading her books to this day."
3,Eye Rolls,"I had to have a willing suspension of disbelief to finish this one. The misunderstandings between two supposedly normal people was beyond belief--the separate bedrooms, how long she had loved him (though he didn't even register surprise--it was a non-event though built up throughout the book).Another thing is that she supposedly only wanted her baby because it was a part of Rome! Not that it was her child and he wanted her to abort it! She should have shown some maternal instincts. She had no backbone at all when it came to him.He was very cold and cruel--even being very angry at her because she was a virgin. He was constantly mad at her and abusive, and she was milktoast.Not the best effort, though it was one of her older romance novels and I prefer the action/adventure ones she wrote later."
2,More story is needed here.,"I felt like this book was written to write sex and the rest was added to help the sex along instead of the sex added to help the story along. The characters were good and I think a bit more story line would have really made this book worth reading, instead it fell flat and I really didn't believe Sarah's motivation. I'm a sucker for a Happily Ever After ending and so that was appreciated, but come on...enough sex...add more story for us to enjoy...the sex should be like the cherry on top not the main course."
5,A Gut Wrenching Story,"I have read this book many years ago and highly recommend it to all. I have re-read this book several times and I am not generally a re-reader.Story of Rome who cannot get over the death of his wife and 2 small sons. His wife's best friend, Sarah has kept the fact to herself that she has always loved Rome and would have never betrayed her friend so she suffered in silence while her friend was alive. Circumstances bring the couple together and they marry for convenience with the stipulation that there will be no children. Sarah agrees but finds herself pregant and while Rome treats her badly during the pregnancy and I could give him a swift kick, I can in a very small way understand.The ending is so gut wrenching. All I can say it what a wonderful read."
4,The audio version is not so good.,"I've always been a loyal fan of LH. ""Sarah's child"" is a good one but the audio version is not a plus of it. DO NOT BUY THE AUDIO CASSETTES!"
1,I threw this book across the room when I was done with it.,"What a stupid book! I have enjoyed most of Linda Howards' books, but this was the exception to the rule. Rome was an ..., who cared nothing about anyone else's feelings but his own and Sarah was a spinelss wimp. I kept waiting and wanting her to give Rome the boot during the entire book - especially given his reaction after she found out she was pregnant. Don't buy this one!"
4,A great resource,"This book gave me the idea to make an automatic bubble maker, which I built with LEGO DACTA materials. I've taken it into some classrooms that are using LEGO DACTA materials to inspire and entertain the kids. They love it!"
2,Up and down,"Meg Tilly: wonderful. Jane Fonda; cold and flat. Anne Bancroft: excellent. The changes in the screenplay from the script are odd choices. Keeping Dr. Livingstone's mother alive is awkwardly done. The ending is different. Most of all, Jane Fonda as the doctor is flat-toned and lacking depth. The fact that there are her iconic barbells on the mantel of her woodsy home said, ""we cast Jane because she's hot at the moment, at the height of her career, even if it's a success in workout videos instead of acting."" I would love to have seen someone with more range in her role."
4,"Quick read, but heavy stuff","The after story of a nun in denial about the suspicious death of a newborn. I read this for a book club and generally enjoyed it. The writing is good. Stage directions are given at the start of the play- you will not see much throughout. I liked this choice, because it allows for a casual reading. You do not feel like you are reading a play, even, so long as you can activate your imagination. It's a quick read, but encourages its audience to think."
3,Wrong Title,This is a nice collection of Memphis Slim and Willie Dixon but it is not the one with Pete Seegar at the Village Gate - I have the original LP and have been looking for it to be placed on CD for years
3,"For linguists, not learners.","Check the book on google books, see what you make of it.I wish I had checked more thoroughly before I bought it. It seems to be very informative, but not in the way I am looking for. It reads like someone's Korean linguistics master's thesis. I assume if you already know Korean and are interested in it's linguistic intricacies and history then it might be worth a read. Probably better read in the original Korean in that case though. In any case, it's not for beginning or intermediate learners just trying to beef up their Korean power. I mean the (English) book has hardly any Korean to read in it!"
2,Not what I expected,"I got this to help learn basic Korean. I hoped it would help me with grammar, pronunciation, sentence structure and things. While it has some of that, it seems more intended for people who study languages for the history of how they were formed. I tried to stay with it to see how it might help, but it is obviously for a scholar or someone needing a reference document to write a paper on the Korean language. If you're looking to learn conversational Korean, this isn't your book."
5,Brigham Young,A very smart and wise man he was and am happy to keep learning from his words. Very inspiration person.
3,"great song, repetitive single","Surface Patterns is, perhaps, the best song in Millenium (together with This faith, in my opinion). Wonderful chorus, well introduced and performed guitars, great electronics, good vocals. The single is a bit repetitive. (personally i don't like remixes a lot) If you happen to listen to this song before listening to the album 'Millenium', don't hesitate: purchase the album, 'Surface patterns' is just one of the 4 or 5 excellent songs in the album; the rest are also good, though there're a couple of those which are a bit repetitive."
3,Super extreme crust/grind,"If you like Disrupt or C.S.S.O., you'll love this. It's also available domestically from Relapse."
5,Amazing,"when I cracked open this book I was amazed, how could these hints be so concise and yet guide me through my day to day life as a Pen salesmen. Now my small town pen shop is bringing in 20000 dollar revenues, but our costs are 21000 but its ok. Anyway when you buy this book know that man with no college degree, yet has accomplished so much says ""this book is good"" i give it 5 thumbs up and would recommend it to anyone who sells stuff."
2,"Very nice, but...","I bought this anklet to take on a beach vacation this winter. It arrived promptly and in new condition. It is a little too yellow for my usual taste of yellow gold (hopefully that makes sense to some). It looks quite nice, but is very thin - a great ankelt if you want to make a subtle statement. I only give it two stars because I started to wear it immediately and after only two or three days, I somehow managed to catch it on my shoe and when I went to pull my shoe off the anklet broke. I am not a very strong person, so it did not take much. I did not contact the seller because I do not see this as their fault. If you are looking for a subtle, delicate, yellow gold anklet I do recommend this, but only if worn with care and caution."
4,Sony Vegas Fun to Use,"Sony Vegas Platnum edition has a great tutorial to learn the program. I have found it easy to use to create highly exceptional DVDs. I like how easy it is to create titles, add music, and produce great transitions. I am a novice using this program and I have enjoyed how easy it is to use."
1,I'm Uninstalling This Program,The program is not simple and easy. It is not bug free. I've found two errors which caused hours of frustration. It cannot even do a simple photo compilation with more than one music track (15 minutes of photos and 4 minutes of music). My friend has a competitor's product. I tried it and I'm buying that one. Too bad I wasted almost $100.
1,Sony Vegas Movie Studio+DVD Platinum.,"I received this last week and I'm still trying to get it to work. Must addmit I need a lot more exrerience in video editing and downloading music and how to put in text into this program. I guess it's a good program I don't know as of yet. This is not for a beginer by far. I will not give up thoe. I plan to ge to the grade school and get one of the kids to come over and show me what to do. But till then I'm still looking for a program that will let me make slide showes with all that I want to put in it, something more friendly user."
1,Product does NOT contain the full Super Bowl,Just got off the phone with [...]. They confirmed that this product DOES NOT contain the full Super Bowl. It contains highlights of the regular season and only HIGHLIGHTS of the Super Bowl. I would not recommend this product if you want to watch the whole Super Bowl again.
1,False Advertisement,I wanted a copy of the Superbowl. This was advertised as that. All it is cuts and clips of the 2009 season and highlights of the Superbowl.It Sucks ~ Thanks for asking
2,"Great Highlights, but no Super Bowl!!!","I was very disappointed in the DVD--I bought the best games of the season and the NFC Champioship game both of which included whole games, so why is the Super Bowl just highlights? I have seen this DVD advertised and in no way is it stated that the game is not part of the DVD--very misleading."
3,Thought it WAS the superbowl,"Purchased for my son but also for the entire family since we are huge Saints fans. Based on the title of the DVD, it lead me to believe that I was buying the game tape when in fact it is simply highlights of the season. Not a bad video but really wanted to watch the Superbowl again."
2,Misleading Title,"It's hard to disappoint a Saints fan with highlights from the best season ever, but this is just that: highlights. Does not contain the full Superbowl. Disappointing, but still contains a lot of interviews and miced sidelines that you won't get elsewhere."
1,dissappointed,I bought as birthday present for my daughter who is a huge Saints fan. She wanted to rewatch the Superbowl. We were so disappointed when we finally got to watch it and it was only highlights from games.
4,2009 Season Highlight Reel,"The title is indeed misleading. However, this is an excellent highlight reel of the 2009 Saints season, through the eyes of NFL Films, often with audio from the Saints radio broadcast crew, as well as that of the various opposing teams. It's great to watch the SB XLIV highlights start with Sean Payton telling the refs, before the game starts, the type of onside kick he plans to call.What's not so great is that there were a lot more highlights available on [...], of SB XLIV, which didn't make it onto this DVD. Still, this looks great on Blu Ray and is a joy for any Saints fan to watch."
5,Feel the excitement,"I thought this was going to be the Super Bowl game. Wanted the game with the Saints broadcasters announcing, and knew that was not going to happen but, since I do not have television hookup, it would be a chance to see the game. This was not the Super Bowl Game -- IT WAS BETTER!!! It is an overview of the entire season -- pictures of key plays and commenting by Hokie and Jim with occasional comments by the announcers for the opposing team (sometimes comments by both sides on a play). I got all those wonderful statements by Jim (""fleur-de-leap"" and ""pigs do fly; hell has frozen over"") AND got to see the key plays -- all the way through the Super Bowl. Then, the cherry on top, as the credits are run at the end, you get to see the Lombardy-gras parade. Still want a copy of the complete Super Bowl game to watch, but this is by far the best of all the Saints videos I purchased this year."
1,wow,this is the worst game i have played in my life you shouldnt even put it on shelves actually i have no idea i've never even played it but you no what is awsome the i-pod from mac wow cya later guys and girls
1,oh my gosh,"I was very disappointed in this game. It looked like a fun game where you walk around in a mirror, look for keys solve puzzles and maybe use magic but no. Instead there's a little hand on the screen that you move around. All you do is click on stuff. I thought you would control mickey. I mean who the heck thought of the stupid hand clicking. This is not how the game should have been. Every time you do something it shows like a 2 minute movie. DONT BUY THIS GAME. Save your money for good games like smash bros, Resident evil series, mario sunshine, something good."
2,"If you are over 10 years old, don't buy it","The graphics and music are nice, however, this game is more like a movie than a game. Most of the time, the game is in self control mode with you watching the games predetermined game action. You do not control Mickey Mouse but rather are given two or three options for Mickey to move after each sequence. The game takes over after each selection and goes through 10 or 20 seconds of action. Then another two or three move options to choose from. YOU DO NOT CONTROL MICKEYS MOVEMENT!I must confess though, my son enjoyed the game O.K., he is five."
1,Not fun at any age!,"I bought this game for my 5 year old triplets. The cursor doesn't always respond well, and is very frustrating. The games ""childrens mode"" is actually more frustrating than the normal mode, as it doesn't have the hint icon. The game occasionally plays a cartoon for up to 5 minutes that you cannot move past until it finishes, which frustrated my kids and myself to no end. The childrens mode sometimes moves automatically, and sometimes goes to the same rooms over and over again. The ""ghost"" terrifies my kids. We all strongly dislike this game, very very frustrating on all levels. A total waste of $40."
1,Worst Game Made For Gamecube,"When I first got this game it looked fun but when I played it for the first time is was horrible. The graphics are bad. I didn't even know how to play it even after looking at the instruction manual. Even in the middle of the game, it would pause without me going to the main menu. I would never buy it again, even if someone paid me. Do not waste your money on it."
1,Very Disappointed,This was one of the most disappointing games for the Game Cube System that I have purchased. The game seems like one for 2 or 3 year olds. My grandchildren will not even play it. My advise to anyone is not to purchase it unless your'e doing so for a toddler.
3,Mickey Mouse B00006F2EC,"Neat graphics, good game but it can be boring. It would be nice if you could move mickey but you just point and click, which is not my thing. It is an action/adventure game."
3,hmm. .,"Ok, this game is geared towards children, I will admit. You don't control mickey at all, which I was kind of upset about, but hey, what am I to do, ya know? Well after playing for awhile (more like 2 hours) I finished this game. Unless you are between the ages of 2-5 I would reccamend <sp> not buying this. But the graphics are really good, its just that sometimes (ok, MOST of the time) you wish you could just hit start and have the game go a little faster. This was my first NGC game, and well, I am honestly hoping that not all of them are like this, b/c if they are... ebay HERE I COME."
4,Warning: Ages 6 and under only!!,"Don't be surprised by the game's inviting, adventourous cover. It's not much fun. This game is really intended for younger kids.Most of the time you are just directing Mickey to open doors or solve no-brainer puzzles, and the only decent interaction is the mini-games you play now and then.If you're really craving a good Disney game, then buy Donald Duck Goin' Quackers. It's much more fun."
2,For a younger audience,"I rented this game and found that it was more suitable for younger game players. Unlike Luigi's Mansion, a child doesn't need to be able to read very much. Older gamers may not enjoy it (as i didn't) because the control is all point and click. You don't actually control Mickey himself, as you do with Luigi. There are numerous movie sequences that get pretty boring and redundent when you have to go back to a place over and over. I might recommend this only for younger kids. Perhaps you might want to rent it first."
1,This is the worst mickey mouse game yet,"when i bought this game i was so mad that i wasted $... on a game that all you do is go through stupid doors.NEVER EVER buy this game it is fun for 4-6 year olds,but it gets extremly boring as you get olderyou find peices of a mirror,SO WHAT.if you want to get this game rent it first,dont bother buying it!"
2,Boring for older game players,"I do not own this; I rented it and I'm really glad I did. I thought it would be something fun because I've always loved anything Disney related, but I found this boring. With only theh point and click feature, there wasn't much control over Mickey. All you can really do with him is open doors and have him walk from room to room. I was disappointed at the beginning with the story features. The graphics are great, but I found them boring and made me question when I'd get to play the game.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the graphics were so good.If you want to try this out, rent it first."
4,Rachel Bolan is King!,"O.K. all you Skid Row Freaks out there,Get ready to lose your minds with this awesome album.Rachel Bolan is back and ready to Rock. The Music is Heavy,The lyrics are wonderful,and the production is great. Dont miss this one people!"
5,Star Quality!,"An excellent live performance from the woman with the most distinctive voice I've ever heard. Belinda may not be a perfect singer (like Celine Dion) but her singing is pure, emotional and expressive. As for the band? You could do better guys!"
1,Disapointed,This was not the live show I was looking for. This has to be the worst produced video ever. How anyone could say anything good about it I can't understand. Belindas performance was average at best. She looked terrible! Her hair was an orange haystack. Her makeup was a disaster so lets zoom right in on it. Most songs start with an up looking shot of the drummer. Who cares about the drummer? The video is quite dark with some goofy blue lights. Belinda dances around like an idiot. Save your money
3,sleepy,"Belinda just didn't seem in to the whole concert thing, she performed like she wished she was somewhere else. She did seem to loosen up a bit when she changed clothes, but it still seemed like I was attending a lecture rather than some pop music. What does that mean? The setting was just not right. Still if you like Belinda she seems to aging gracefully."
1,"Belinda Carlise ""Runaway Live""","Not a lot to comment on I have just played this DVD and of course Belinda shows her talent in this performance,The transfer is fairly good on the video side but the AUDIO is very bad in fact a shocking mix, I know this is a 13 year old recording. I have spent a lot of hard earned dollars to have gear that produces a repoduction that delivers quality audio but rubbish in rubbish out. a remaster is what this DVD needs it's a lousy audio field .I would not recommend it to any one who wants quality .cos! this doesnt deliver much at all"
4,Not fair for this woman,"well i recently purchased this dvd along with many others so that i can have a visual way close to Belinda bedides her cd's.i must say that while you can easily identify the perfection in her voice although live , the sound engineers of the concert didn't capture the magic .Belinda is amazing, perfoming almost as good as in the studio .she dances barefoot on the carpets placed on stage and her looks is as always breathtaking.a very full tracklist and nice musicians.but the sound is not equivalent to belinda's magic. still is a very nice concert and it will deliver the emotions of belinda's songs."
3,So So !,"Although this DVD contains a collection of Belinda's greatest songs, but the performance of she and the band is so so and not outstanding. The quality of picture is not very clear, either. But this is the only DVD collection you can buy now."
1,What an awful show,"For you all Carlisle fans out there. You're probably like me. You gonna go get this DVD no matter what you read here. So I did. What a big disappointment. It's amazing there are 2 or 3 reviews here actually took the words right out of my mouth. In short, the show was bad, the lighting was bad, her hair was bad, her make up was bad. You can see the negative effect of drugs and alcohol on a performing artist. Although for most other artists it work the positive way!!! She didn't prepare much for the concert. She didn't want to be there. She was just going through the motion. Although the rest of the band was trying a lot harder and wasn't bad. Honestly, I don't see how some can give it a 5 stars. You know a 5 star performance when you see one. ANd this one is far away from being one. But hey, I'm a fun so I got it. That's what a fan do. But I wouldn't mind giving it away if anyone wants it. I'm just gonna keep listening to her CD and forget about this DVD."
4,Patterns for using power tools to make wood into baskets,This book mostly consists of large patterns (not reduced) for cutting a flat piece of wood such that it forms a basket when turned on its side. Making such a basket requires skill and access to a jigsaw and bandsaw.
5,Bigger than expected,"I bought this bag afraid that it might not be big enough (I feared the battery pack on the already large Canon 5D would be too much).Since then I acquired two new lenses (to a total of 4, one being a 70-300mm tele) and the bag still holds all of the above, the battery charger, cable, a spare pocket camera and my kindle.Sadly, I can no longer fit a bottle of water there without taking out one of the lenses. =)"
4,"Very nice bag, would buy again","I own a much larger backpack in which I usually store my complete gear set, however sometimes it's too bulky to take around. This bag does a great job of carrying around a flash, an extra lens as well as a decently sized body+lens.The reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that it seems to me that the zippers could be a bit larger to make it easier to find and pull out the camera quickly, also, I'd rather have it open the other way around."
3,Be very careful of the strap....,"I bought this for my Nikon D7000. The Nikon neck strap is very short and uncomfortable so I decided to try the case strap on the camera. It seemed secure because of the clip system but not once, but TWICE in 5 minutes did the right clip fail and thankfully the left one held tight because if not, my brand new D7000 would have smashed lens first into the pavement. The bag itself is good. Has space for the camera, 18-105, 55-300, two hoods, charger, cables, extra memory cards, remote release, all the good stuff.The bag is good. The strap is now my mortal enemy."
5,Better than my Rezo 170 AW,"I have aLowepro Rezo 170 AW Camera Bagand it was sufficient until i got my SB600 flash, MB-D80 grip and 70-300 VR lens. I also have aThink Tank Streetwalker Hard Drive Backpackthat is big and spacious which also allows me to carry a laptop but sometime I feel it is just too cumbersome. Then I came across this Rezo 180 AW, and as one of the previous reviewer said, looks can be deceiving. I gave it a try, and to my surprise it fits all my equipments with some space left to be used. Here is the list of items that are now in the bag:1) Nikon D90 with MB-D80 grip and 18-105mm VR attached2) SB600 flashgun in its case3) Nikon 70-300mm VR4) Nikon 50mm f/1.8D5) Stofen Omnibounce Diffuser6) Extra battery, memory card, wireless remote7) Rocket blower, cleaning kit and a lenspenI love my Lowepro!"
4,Some things you can just trust,"As the saying goes, ""The only things for sure are death and taxes"" and the consistent quality of JJ Cale albums.Sure there are some albums I prefer over others but when I look at my out of 5 ratings for JJ's albums they are all 4 or 5.Its like going into that same coffee bar because you know damn well that the quality and taste of their coffee is gonna be of the same high standard everyday.Buy it......you cant go wrong."
2,Not your Grandpas JJ Cale,"Stone River is a great song, and there are a couple of other decent tunes, but the rest of it is crap. If you love the old JJ, you won't like most of this cd."
2,Long Time Listener,"Sometimes you hear an album and it's like being with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this album. Having been a fan of Mr. Cales for over thirty years, I was very disappointed. The songs on this album are a muddled echo of his previous work. Newer fans and paid critics may find this album enjoyable but I have no desire to listen to it again."
4,Cale is Back!,"Great to have yet another JJ Cale album. Though it has been a long time since his last studio album ""Guitar Man"", new Cale albums are always worth waiting for.Don`t expect big changes in his musical style. He sticks with his classic laid back style. Most of the songs on this new album have brothers or sisters in his extensive back-catalogue. ""My Gal"" and ""Jailer"", ""The Problem"" and ""I`ll Kiss The World Goodbye"" , ""Rio"" and ""Don`t Cry Sister"" etc. This is no problem for me personally, because us usual the ""feeling"" is there.The album starts off with 5 traditional Cale songs. It is not until the 6th track that the melodic side of him really shows. ""The Problem"", ""Homeless"" and ""Fancy Dancer"" are already favourites of mine.Cale has made yet another fine album and has lived up to his own high standards.""Grasshopper"" is still my favourite album, though."
2,Sigma lenses - inexpensive but not built to last,"As a professional wedding photographer I have owned many cameras and lenses. I've always chosen my equipment carefully, wanting both performance and value. Although I used primarily Nikon products, I have purchased several Sigma lenses over the years, mainly because they cost much less than Nikkor lenses. Unfortunately you get what you pay for. This year I've had two Sigma lenses fail. Both were less than three years old. The first had an autofocus problem. The second, an 18-50mm f2.8 EX, had an aperture failure. Since the warranties have expired I am now expected to shell out $180 to have each lens repaired.I think a product which has been well maintained should last longer than three years."
1,Don't waste you money on this software,"I looked at a number of PDF creation products for my company. Due to the exorbitantly high cost of Acrobat, even through their volume buying program, we decided it was best to go with another company's tool. There are many adequate PDF creation products on the market today. This product is not one of them. We had a lot of difficulty installing and activating the trial version. We were unable to get any type of support, even through email. To make matters worse, when we finally did get the software activated, it kept freezing and crashing the workstations where it was installed. It seemed to work on about 1/2 of the files we threw at it and crashed on the other half. It seems like a number of people have had this same experience with it. What a disapointment! 1 star for the rating is generous."
1,Buggy Software - Hard to Install and Keeps Crashing,"I was leery of this product when I found out it was from a republisher, which is always a bad sign. But for $50 bucks I figured the worst that could happen would be I would be out a tank of gas. Boy was I wrong. This software hosed up my entire system. The install kept aborting and then when it finally finished, my other Windows apps worked strangely. I emailed the company repeatedly but never heard back from them about my problems. When I uninstalled it, my computer went back to normal. After this experience, I'll never buy software again from a republisher."
3,"Not bad, but toolbar is way too annoying","I am almost through the 30 day trial of Nitro PDF Professional. It is fast and does what you expect, but here are the negatives to look out for if you buy this:1. It does not convert PDF to Word well at all. In fact no one does. It takes each line and makes it a text box. Good luck editting in Word in that format. It does do everything it says is does, but that is just the flaw in PDF conversion to Word right now.2. The most annoying thing is the tool bars that get inserted into the MS Office applications. The tool bar wants to have its own tool bar row. This means that it messes up your look and appearance of the way you use your current tool bars. It also shrinks the workable space since it pushes down the tool bars one more row. This was sooooo annoying that I decided to look at other products.All in all if you don't care about shifting tool bars, the product is stable and fast so try it out yourself for free for 30 days no obligation."
4,Great Product,"After being screwed by Adobe (don't ask), I did some research and bought this product. Great, works better than the Adobe version at a frachion of the cost. What could be better? How about not dealing with the a##holes at adobe customer support!"
1,Do not Buy.,"One dollar is too much for the hassle you are going to get from this software. The activation of the software is a real headache, the staff are not helpful. I believe they deliberately force the consumer to purchase their subscription to ""expert tech support"" knowing that the software is not going to function properly. Recommendation Adobe or other company. Please call me Nitro I would like to hear from you someday."
1,Sending it back. Not worth it.,"I agree with the other reviews that this product seems to be a pre 1.0 version. I'm willing to take the hit in tax and shipping to send it back to them just to get some money back from this useless product. It sure does not convert back to word as they imply. The product activation is a real pain and I could not move it to another system after I installed it on the first, after uninstalling it from the first. I was only able to activate from the first system I loaded it on. I would not like to buy another copy of this product if/when the hard drive fails.I would give 0 stars if I could.I also can't believe that they ask you to disable your AV and Internet Security tools to activate this product! The only positive is that they do have a 30 day money back guarantee."
1,license registration fails; won't uninstall - miserable experience,"Nitro PDF Pro registered copy commences license failure warnings after 2 months. Now I want to uninstall it and cannot. It attempts to validate install in order to uninstall, so I am now a hostage to this POC software. Overall, I feel ripped off and the pdf functionality is cheap and limited for $80."
2,Get Adobe Acrobat,"This software is billed as completely compatible with the PDF document format. Unfortunately, it is not. It will suffice for an occasional text document, but not for a complicated layout, or for publishing forms.Radio buttons, check boxes do not render correctly. One cannot use OpenType or Type 2 fonts in editing. The program frequently hangs and crashes resulting in unrecoverable documents. There also is inconsistent application of tools in dialog boxes, many hard-to-find functions, and disorganized menus.The plus is that customer service is fast, but their solution is to wait for the next version. I am taking advantage of their 30-day money back guarantee."
1,Does not open all PDF,"Not terrible, but not good. Is pretty limited compared to Adobe and Nuance, and worse of all does not open all PDF files. It shows an Adobe logo when it fails and says go get Adobe Reader!"
1,Don't buy this version,See my review on version 5. I own both versions and version 5 is much better than version 4 which I upgraded to version 5. No more problems with printing with version 5.
1,Not So Hot,"Well, for starters, Nitro's PDF to Word makes you use specific versions of Word (it uses Word macros to do the conversion.) They don't tell you upfront about this important fact. I use WordPerfect occasionally and I'm out of luck if I want to do conversions, it can't be used. Also, since Word is launched as well during the conversion, the process consumes a lot of resources.As Far as the conversion process itself, Nitro PDF does a rather poor job of converting. See the independent review on PDFZone.com, where it says:""It sounds good, but this is not a feature to buy the program for-it simply doesn't work very well.""http://www.pdfzone.com/article2/0,1895,1850873,00.aspI wish I read review before this before I brought this piece of crap!"
1,Can't uninstall this blasted thing,"Will someone please tell me how to uninstall Nitro Pro? I've been trying for hours. thanks, Ellen"
5,Magnific,"This book it is really good, help me to realize how good is the Lord withus. This book connect me with with many regular people and this is a miracle. We need more books like that. Thanks Tzivi, you ar a man that love man because you know the Lord."
5,I love this movie...,"I watch it often. I especially like the cozy little stone-walled office in the center of the graveyard, ""The cement walls make it a wee bit Christmas-like"", I believe the caretaker says in his Scottish accent. If anyone has similar movies to recommend, I would like to see more like this!"
4,Great fun,"Not the best films from the Drive-in Disc collection, but still great fun. 'The Hand' is pretty bad, actually, but 'I bury the living' is spooky enough. You could choose to watch them separately without the adverts, extras and the drive-in sound effects, but I'm not sure why you would have bought this otherwise - the whole effect is the point of the DVD. If you're new to Drive-in Discs, I wouldn't start here due to 'The Hand' letting the side down a bit, but worthwhile if you're slowly building up your drive-in library."
4,This is NOT a zombie movie - it is a slick thriller.,"Don't let the packaging and title mislead you. Although one would think this is some kind of zombie flick, it is anything but. There's a hint of creepiness due to the graveyard setting, but the film plays more like a Twilight Zone episode and winds itself up as an old fashioned murder mystery. Excellent writing, high caliber cast, and good pacing set this film apart. It's a wonder it has been so obsure - it really is a gem of a movie."
5,An Unacknowledged Classic,"This film is terrifying. I expected some hoky fun when I rented it (judging from the cover), but then recalled that Stephen King had listed it (in ""Danse Macabre"") as one of the ten most frightening films he'd ever seen. All the same, I figured his memory must have gone foggy.I was wrong. The plot, when laid out bare, sounds ridiculous. A rather ordinary, boring caretaker of a cemetery (accompanied by a hilarious 'Scottsman') happens to gain power over the fundamentals of life and death with a board that lays out the structure of the cemetery--where people are buried, have been buried, and will be buried. All this sounds absurd and very 1950's, yes, but it turns out well. You actually start believing it yourself and can feel the protagonist's anguish. The end is disappointing, but the buildup is more than worth it. Black pin, white pin, black pin, white pin....."
4,i bury the dead,this movie to me isnt not a five star butt with famous actor it goes from three to four other wise its really not that great it does have unique story and some moments of trying to figure it out butt it lacks something so its a four. any lower i think your missing some marbles in your brain
2,Drab and Dull,"With a title like ""I Bury The Living"", this certainly is not what I was expecting - this was basically like a longer, more drawn-out version of one of the less thrilling episodes of ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Alfred Hitchcock"". The characters were pretty uninteresting, which is really what made this movie unenjoyable for me - very drab, boring, wooden acting. And even the supernatural element in the story was ruined by a terrible ""twist"" ending. I like lots of older horror movies, many way older than this 80-minute sleeping pill. I would only recommend this to people who saw it when it first came out and are interested in it for nostalgia reasons."
2,i bore the living...,...or 1 lame star for no action; not exciting or entertaining enough at all. great dvd film quality though. at least i saw this once but now its going in the garbage. movie is not what i thought it'd be so not to be.
3,A little disappointing,"After being very pleased with my Brother MFC-8220 laser fax/printer , I bought the Brother HL-5170DN for my office. I'm somewhat disappointed in that the printer has ocassional trouble handling envelopes. It will frequently jam.Also, while it installs smoothly and easily into Windows XP, and works conveniently with the controls in MS Word (2003), it is awkward to set printer paper controls from within WorkPerfect 11.Perhaps Brother engineers should look into a better control interface.Otherwise, it is a fast and quality printer."
1,SirJamALot,"This printer jams all the time. Tech support advised using24 lb paper, and this worked!So: Tech support knows about the jam. They know the problemcan be fixed with heaver paper...but why won't they providea fix that works with 20lb paper?If you want to print with normal paper, try another printer."
5,brother laser printer,"Works like a champ. Not too bad to set up. I am a teacher and depend on clean, fast prints for lesson plans etc. Love the two sided feature."
4,Debrae Debut Does Right,"This album is very good. A strong 4 stars, not quite up to 5. Debrae sings with energy and enthusiasm. About half the songs are written by others, the other half written by her. She does country/lite rock well. Good songs:Don't Walk in Here Like You Never Walked Out - very good uptempo song with coutnry flavorMan of Your DreamsMaking the Most of Goodbye - singer will allow herself some strange behavior on account of a breakupLet's Pretend We Never Met -You're NO Good for MeWhy Did You Have to Be so Nice - more old-timey music, but modern lyricsI Like Him the Best"
1,For the starry eyed,"""When the star in your eye meets the star in the sky ..."" is when you will have found your career calling--that's the underlying message. Or one of them. Indeed! What a load of codswallop."
2,Didn't like it.,The leather is too thin to have the feet on it without support. It's slouchy in a way that makes it look akward.
4,Great Value,"I bought this for both my boys! It is the best deal on the net and if I have another child, I will buy again (maybe with a different cover)."
2,Not What I Look For In A Baby Book,"I have always enjoyed the book Guess How Much I Love You and thus ordered the baby book for our new child. The book is very traditional and although I enjoy the illustrations and the story lines, I was dissapointed with it as a baby book. There is not even a space for any religious ceremonies, like baptism. The space for a birth announcement is extremely small, and there is not even a space for Baby's First Haircut. It also leaves little room for creativity, pictures and adding your own baby memories. I ended up ordering another baby book."
5,The Entire True Story of Christian,"This is the story I was looking for! The entire story of Christian from the beginning, including the clip we've all seen on You Tube. I loved this movie! Sat down and watched it as soon as it arrived. Shows all the problems and joys involved in re-introducing Christian to the wild, including the emotions of John and Ace during the process. There is also plenty of information from and about George Adamson and his work. Some very sad moments mixed in with the joy. What a fabulous film; I loved it and you will tool"
3,Heartwarming story,"The footage was dated and faded, but it could not hide the sweet story of two men who had loved their lion cub, successfully transitioned him back to a natural life in Africa.I bought this for myself and as a gift for my sister-in-law, who teaches - and who first told me the story about Christian.Bring your hankies."
2,Classic SciFi,"I started to read this book 32 years ago, but part of it was missing so couldn't finish. Thanks to Amazon I was finally able to find a copy and read it. Unfortunately, it wasn't one of Moorcock's better books. Ah well!"
3,"Old, Perhaps Obsolete, but Interesting.","It is, this book, a compilation of thoughts of lot of people about the human condition. Good for students of the 60's and 70'. Now seems a bit obsolete. Nevertheless, as a tribute to Mr Brinton, whose work I appreciate a lot, it deserve to be read at least in parts ans chunks."
3,Original version better,"This game is one of my family's favorites. Unfortunately, the company updated it and the changes literally took all the fun out of it. If you try this game, find a version from before 2004."
3,"good concepts, but not enough depth or variety","This is a well intentioned book, and has 100 interviews with real life Casting Directors. But after repeating the basics over and over with 100 interviews, there is not alot of depth or additional details. The basic teachings, such as being early to the audition, being prepared, being polite, being a professional, being an enthusiastic auditioner.....well, this is repeated for the 100 interviews. It could have been a much better book, with more details, so 3 stars."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Mac users: The Mac version is only compatible with older PowerPC Macs - the current generation of Intel Macs cannot even install, much less run this game.Loved it on the PC, totally bummed that I can't run it on my new iMac."
1,WARNING: Does NOT work on Intel-based iMacs!,"I feel mislead both by Aspyr and Amazon for this purchase. I'm grossly disappointed with this software. This software will NOT work on Intel-based iMacs. No fix is available, and I've repeatedly emailed Aspyr asking for one. No response. The game looks great and presuming it worked on my brand new iMac, I'd have a much different opinion. If you're using any new Intel-based Apple computers, DO NOT ORDER THIS SOFTWARE!"
1,Beware,This is an old game and will not work with the newer Mac Pro computers. Because it is an old game the manufacturer said they will not be updating it.
1,Will not work on latest Macs,"Purchased for a Macbook Pro, 2.4GHz, and was informed by Aspyr tech support that the game will not work on the latest platforms."
2,Did not work under OSX Mountain Lion,"If you have not yet upgraded to Mountain Lion, and are playing this game; congratulations... because once you do, this game will no longer be supported. Never got to try the game, as a result."
1,Game has not aged well,"I thought it would be fun to play a retro strategy game. I needn't have bothered as this game shows its age all too well. The game play is all right, but the graphics are nothing to get excited about. Not in this day and age. It is a shame too, because the world needs more strategy games, especially for power mac computers. This is a first person soot them up game disguised as a strategy game and I was deeply disappointed...."
4,If you've got time to learn it.,This is a great game if you have time to kill and don't mind learning the convoluted controls.
4,The Red Shoes,For a movie that was done in 1950 it is wonderful. The story line seems a little trite. But the dancing is superb.
4,Historical Gem for Dancers,"My general comment is that this is a grand and beautiful movie. It is very entertaining. There have been some wonderful dance sequences in the movies, but none have surpassed ""The Red Shoes Ballet"" within this movie.The rest of this review is rather esoteric, and I apologize for that, but it may be useful to those interested in Dance.This is a must-have for anyone interested in Ballet History. While it is not a true story, Boris Lermontov is clearly based on Serge Diaghilev, down to the funny white streak in his hair. Moira Shearer playes the lead ballerina Victoria Page. Shearer, of Sadler's Wells, exhibits her geniune and compelling technique. The Lermontov/Page relationship echos that of Diaghilev and Nijinsky or perhaps Mr. B. and his girls. The crazy genius choreographer and dancer Leonide Massine has a wonderful part, and there is a little cameo appearance of Marie Rambert in the Mercury Theatre. See this movie and watch for other interesting parallels and tidbits!"
3,Faulty Disc 2,"The film itself (Disc 1) is wonderfully restored & all the extras on Disc 1are interesting. However, on Disc 2 the documentary on the making of ""The Red Shoes"" could not be accessed on my DVD player, only on my computer. All theother features could be accessed.I returned it to Amazon & they promptly sent me a replacement. Unfortunately,the problem still exists. Beware this flaw."
4,Fine Criterion restoration,"Criterion has done another great job restoring this 1948 British film about love, devotion and mostly ballet. Shot in color it looks pretty good with the Criterion touch. Frankly, I didn't know much about it, but it was getting some publicity so I checked it out. I can't recall another movie that essentially stops in the middle to show a nearly full ballet, or at least an act. ""Red Shoes"" was a story written by Hans Christian Anderson and is about a girl who tried on red ballet shoes that wouldn't allow her to stop dancing. This becomes the subject of the ballet. In life, it is also a metaphor for our ballerina and her composer husband. Does she stick with him or further her career with the nasty old impresario Boris? I really liked the actor playing Boris, French actor Anton Walbrook. I'm not sure how this movie played in America but it clearly set the stage for musicals to come."
5,The Red Shoes 2009 Criterion Releasee,"The 2009 version of The Red Shoes released by Criterion is beyond spectacular. I had very much enjoyed the 1948 theater presentation and the 1998 DVD version, of which I have a copy, but the 2009 DVD fills me with awe. In retrospect, I had believed that the earlier version as seen on the DVD had been photographed using a soft lens, but in the 2009 release the colors are rich beyond belief, and the images are crisp. This Red Shoes deserves to be included in the core collection of lovers of cinema and especially ballet."
5,"As I've grown older, I appreciate this movie more and more","When I first saw The Red Shoes, as a ballet-obsessed college student, I thought it was relentlessly corny, cliché-ridden, bombastic and kitschy, although I loved the glimpses of the old-school Ballets Russes. Seeing it many years later, I appreciated the beautiful special effects, made years before all you needed was a keyboard and a mouse. Seeing it a month ago, I've come to agree with those who consider it one of the truly great movies."
2,Western books,Love this movie with Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland. So reading the book. Not bad. Still like Louis Lamour and Zane Grey better. This is a good story.
4,Good for beginners,These tools are fine for the beginning wood turner. I gave them as a gift to my son-in-law who wants to learn the art.
2,"looks great, not too tough",Now when snoop dogg makes a dog toy I figure it has been tested on his pit bulls. No way. My boston Terrier tore this thing up in a few minutes creating a huge pile of white stuffing. Too pricey for that level of durability.
1,One star--just barely.,"One of the reasons I read this book was that the customer ratings for it were so high. Readers referred to it as ""haunting"" and ""the best WWII story ever."" I'm truly mystified by these comments. I found the story elementary and ordinary and predictable. We didn't really get to know the characters well--especially the downed flyer. I thought he came across as insensitive and extraordinarily selfish. The ""love"" story struck me as entirely superficial. I liked Anita Shreve's The Pilot's Wife, but I could barely come up with one star for Resistance."
4,Educational and Captivating,"Prior to reading ""Resistance"" by Anita Shreve, I did not know much about the Nazi Resistance in Belgium. It was interesting to read about a different side of the war, one that is often neglected - the homefront. In Belgium, resistance fighters took refugees who were escaping Nazi persecution due to religion or nationality, or depending, which side of the war they were fighting for. I found this book to be very enlightening, educational and overall excellent. It was exciting to see a romance blossom amidst the horrible war going on. In classic Shreve style, she twists the plot left and right, keeping you on the edge of your seat and your finger ready to turn the page at each moment."
2,Not Her Best-or even close,"I loved ""The Pilot's Wife"" and ""The Weight of Water"", but this book was just downright sloppy. It was like a bad Danielle Steel book. What happened to Ms. Shreve's wonderful prose? The ending was rushed as well. With a little effort, research and heart this might have been a great book."
5,My First Anita Shreve Novel,This was the very first Anita Shreve Novel I read. It was quite unique compared to her many others and would be the first one I'd read over again!
2,"OK, not Great","This book was just O.K. Not a great love story, not a great WWII resistance story. The more interesting parts were of the other people, the husband, the boy, the storekeeper. There are parts in all of her books where the writing appears forced, the dialog false. This was more evident in The Pilot's Wife (which I wouldn't recommend). It only happened in this one a few times, just enough to strike a discordent note and make me realize I was reading. I hate it when that happens."
3,Lost Love = Great Love,"One of Shreve's earliest books. The author creates a mood with France and WW2 but it's more sentimental than her later fiction works. A warm romantic read but a little long on the drawn out secret affair, love child, and passion amidst conflict. Better off with The Last Time They Met, also by Anita Shreve."
3,Good story!,"At first I didn't understand what was happening, so many characters...but as the story progressed, it became more and more interesting. By the middle of the book, I couldn't put the book down!! Excellent!"
4,Delightful historical fiction,A well-written yarn set in WWII Northern Europe. Excellent descriptions and interesting plot twists
5,a beautiful story of love amidst tragedy,"Claire is a housewife stuck in an unhappy marriage, working for the Resistance movement. Ted is an Allied pilot whose plane crashes in Belgium. Ted comes to Claire's house and Claire nurses him back to health. The two fall passionately in love while Claire's husband is away helping the resistance movement. Claire and Ted are a perfect example that you don't have to be fluent in language to be able to say ""I love you"". Sadly, the real world catches up with them, with tragic consequences for both characters. The final chapter will break your heart. I recommend this book for anyone who desires a good, hearty read."
4,Quick reading,"""Resistance"" was a most readable story that took place in a small window of time during World War II in Belgium. An American B-17 plane crash-lands and the crew is spirited off to nearby safe houses by members of the Belgian Resistance. The story focuses on Claire, a local woman in an unhappy marriage, and Ted Brice, the pilot.Shreve depicts the seemingly hopeless situation, tempered by hope, in the face of wartime hardships and the risks that the Resistance members took on a daily basis.I found the ending a bit contrived and rushed, with some questionable aspects.This is a story that encompasses only a little more than a month in the thousands of days of war, but it is a story of great emotional intensity. I cannot remember when I read a book this quickly."
2,"Gripping beginning, boring middle, hopeless ending","The beginning of the book is well written with excellent multiple POV scenes. From page 160 onwards, after Claire and Ted had sex, the pace becomes boring -- the couple gaze into each other's eyes, hold hands, take long walks, had sex again and do other mushy stuff. The ending gets even more boring and I near-abandon my reading. Skimming through the pages, I seem to see long narratives of Gestapo torture (ho-hum) and even longer monologues. I had expected the ending to be a tense confrontation betwen Henri, Claire's husband, and Ted but it deoes not happen. What a waste to a great start."
3,Amm.. okay but..,"Well .. I'm a female and this is my second day trying out this product. I have a problem of ingrown hairs. I have been seeing a little progress in some parts of my body, but at some parts I guess my skin is a little more tough so it might take longer to get to see results. The only problem in this product is that it didn't mention when I bought it that it was a travel size. I only found out that it was when I received it and it said on the receipt that it was a Travel size. I'm not good at relating sizes (oz) to actual size. So just in case you are like me. This is a tiny little travel container."
5,Wonderful!,"This book should be on every woman's nightstand. It is inspirational. The 1st chapter(on ""rest"") helps you to settle down and learn to focus on God and His influence on your life. The chapters that folllow take you by the hand and walk with you. It is a good book for new Christians as well as life long ones."
4,Helps to get back on spiritual track,I enjoyed using this as a thought provoking guide to get back on track spiritualy. Also gave as a gift.
4,There is gold here,I liked it quite a bit. Two of these stories are works of pure genius. Hemingway is a brilliant short story writer.
2,Left me cold,"The Snows of Kilimanjaro has little to do with snow or Mount Kilimanjaro or Africa. The first short story serves as a pretext. An author and journalist is dying, and he regrets he didn't write more recollections of his early past. This is followed by fifteen or so tableaux of Michigan rural life (mostly). The pieces are dry and descriptive. They serve to show, not to explain, and barely follow any plots. Each is preceded by an unrelated journalistic snippet: on the 1920s evacuation of Smyrna, on bullfighting, on WWI Italy. This is self-referential, of course. The Snows of Kilimanjaro is at the border between short-story writing and journalism. This fits Hemingway's style. But whether it is interesting is another matter. I much preferred his novels, even if they too are fictionalised reporting, especially A Farwell To Arms and For Whom The Bell Tolls."
5,A Good Collection,"I read this book many, many years ago and it is still fresh in my mind. Hemingway is an essential writer. If you haven't read this book, you should do so as soon as possible."
4,You may want to buy The Complete Short Stories...,"This very short little volume serves as the perfect introduction to the work and style of Ernest Hemmingway. It contains ten of his most popular short stories. THIS IS BY NO MEANS A COMPLETE COLLECTION OF HIS GREATEST HITS. Notably absent from this collection is ""Hills Like White Elephants."" However, it does contain such perennial favorites as ""The Killers,"" ""A Clean Well-Lighted Place,"" and ""The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."" Ultimately, the consumer (like myself) will be tempted to buy The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemmingway, which is not much more expensive."
5,A lotta fun!!,I received this book as a gift a couple of days ago and havn't had a chance to read more than a few pages myself due to the fact that it's always in someone elses hands!! It's the ultimate coffee table book if there ever was one! I just ordered 10 of them as future gifts for friends and colleagues- perfect present to have on hand for any occasion! A lotta fun!!
3,Quirky,"This was a quick read of quirky eBay auctions. This book was part eBay users manual on how to create infamous auctions and part catalogue of some of the strangest items ever put up for sale on the website. It got a bit redundant after a while when it seemed that all these notorious auctions were pulled before the final sale due to controversy or questions of legitimacy or ethics. I'm not an eBay user, but I'm sure anyone who is part of that community will really enjoy this book."
5,A Must Read for Forensic Anthropology Students!,"As a forensic anthropology student I found this book to be a wonderful read. A change from the technical information I read daily, but instead a biographical account of Dr. Owsley's adventures as a forensic anthropologist with including a trip to Guatemala, the aftermath of Waco, and his courageous battle to challenge the government and prevent the hasty repatriation of Kennewick Man. Not only will any biological or forensic anthropology student will be entertained by this book, but the general public as well!"
3,"started good, started dragging","The author himself states he started researching the book about a controversial skeletal discovery, then found an interesting scientist tied to the case. The background on anthropology and the legal system was interesting, but not enough to cover about 60% of the book. I had to skim over so many parts that had details completely unrelated to the plot, details thrown in just to add up the page count."
2,a writing style for children,"I was definitely looking forward to reading ""No Bone Unturned"" so was really disappointed that the writing style was, it seemed to me, directed toward children in the teen bracket. This is an ok audience, but I should have read all your reviews and paid attention to the Reader from Alexandria, who pointed this out by calling the style ""amateurish"". I don't think this is the case. The style is too consistent. I really think this author is so intent on inspiring young people that his writing reflects this attitude on every level. Yes, the content is interesting, but not interesting enough to keep me going."
5,Benedict Rocks,"I first became a Benedict fan reading his books about professional athletes and their ability to get away with violence off the field of play. He's a remarkable storyteller with a journalistic style. I was again outraged at my government taking a lax view of science unless it serves the corporations' interests. I certainly want to know more about Kennewick Man. Well done, Jeff!"
5,Solid lens,"Had this lens 2 weeks now, major and huge difference from the kit lens. No vignetting and very fast at 2.8 throughout. I'll update if i find problems later.And by the way! CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP and affordable :)To update a couple months later, the lens has been put to constant use and still does'nt dissapoint. Sharp and fringing seems well controlled."
4,Really easy to use,"This reader is really easy to use. Just put your card in and it becomes a new drive on your computer. Coupled with Ofoto's (www.ofoto.com) free uploading software which automatically comes up you stick a card in, it's pretty much a brainless activity... :-)"
1,Wouldn't work with 64 MB SM Card consistently,"This may have just been a defective reader that I received, but my card reader wouldn't work on any cards after using a 64 MB card successfully, taking it out, and then putting it back in. It was really weird. I made sure I had the latest drivers and tried it on two machines running Windows 98 Second Edition."
4,Does What it Says,"A very handy and compact tripod with relatively good stability. On flat surface, can even handle a HDD based camcorder and can definitely handle flash based camcorders. May not be stable with a little bulkier DSLRs but excellent with regular P&S cameras. All in all, a good one to put away in your camera bag. Have gifted a few to friends. Would highly recommend this one."
5,Adorable book,"My daughter is 17 months old and I just bought this book for her a couple weeks ago. She absolutely loves it. I've been teaching her Baby Sign and she's picked up the sign for ""bear"" because of this book. (there are also other animals in the book that she likes to point at).The story line is adorable. I think it is a good way to introduce the concept of a new baby to the family to a young child, without going into a ton of detail about how it happens. We are expecting a baby when our daughter will be 21 months, and right now she cannot grasp that I have a baby in the tummy, but I think with more reading of this book that she will be able to learn about getting a new brother or sister.I haven't read any of the other books by the same author, I have only read this one. And as a stand alone book, I think it's wonderful."
4,Newsboys Best,I have several Newsboys CDs. They usually have one song I love and the rest I never listen too.This one is different. This is their best.
5,This Band is awesome!,"The Newsboys are awesome, I could listen to them all day! Their music pumps ypu up, while it tells you of the mercy and grace of God the Father Almighty! Bless them!"
5,Newsboys,"Newsboys are about the very best Christian Rock band that I have ever heard and have seen them live about dozen times. Everything they do from live performance, to DVD to CD is way above average, not to mention their testimony and ministry. I have enjoyed them with my children in the 90's and continue to enjoy them now with the grandkids. We have their CD's in our cars and DVD at home. Their tunes never get old, and continue to feed my spirit with joy and truth. Thank you Newsboys for all that you have accomplished and may God continue to use you and bless you."
2,A great delusion,"Hmm...I got that with the other one (A.M. Champions 1981/86) but it's only a list of A.M. Champions with NO PICTURES (some but nothing more than 7-10) and NO PEDIGREES...Hmpf Considering the price and the special order, only 2 packs of photocopies (they seems like university notes) i don't find them useful."
1,Very small,"Didn't review this enough I guess, these are very small and of course come unsharpened, which isn't unexpected. Don't have much use for them as they are however."
3,Definitely has it's scary moments,"Overall, this is a good movie if you like to get scared. The movie does drag on slowly, a lot in the beginning and some all throughout. I wouldn't recommend watching it alone and in the dark...unless you're ok with the potential nightmares. I enjoy scary movies and this had some scare to it. I only wished it had less of a 'can we get on with it already' feeling in the beginning."
3,nice and scary,"I heard about this movie about a month ago and finally found it and was glad I did. I love scary movies so I had to see this. It was a little predictable moreover it was not one that I could not watch alone in the dark, cause I did and had no problem with it. I would give it more stars if I had to watch it with the hubby.It is a great rental not a owner though."
1,stoopid film,nothing can be more stupid than watching this super stupid film. zero star is what it deserves. a com[plete waste of time. i deserve better as a member of amazon prime. i'm so disappointed that this is the kind of movie that amazon offers to its prime members.
1,The WORST!,After reading the reviews I thought it must be good. WRONG! I must be on another planet then these other viewers.horrible acting & 1 hr too long. What a waste of time!!!
1,Just don't do it! Lazy writing and directing.,"If they would have stuck to the more subtle ""did you see that"" kind of creepiness it would have made a decent movie; the concept and acting is pretty sound. However, the movie went way over the top way too soon."
1,Great Potential...Dumb movie,"*****may contain slight Spoilers*****I'm generally not a tough critic and I can take a movie for what it is supposed to be. I thought the beginning of this started off great. I enjoyed how they mocked all those paranormal ""reality"" shows. It started off pretty creepy and it was the subtle things that were really intense, but then the movie just got stupid, rather than having interaction with creepy paranormal spirits it turned into your run of the mill low budged horror film. A builidng that mysteriously changed form and rearranged itself, night time lasting for several days....c'mon.....they took a good idea and a great begining and just crapped on the rest. By the end absolutely none of it was scary or creepy."
1,grave encounters,"Bought grave encounters off amazon, it will not play on my dvd as its wrong region code.. Not happy as this was not on details on website. I'm now stuck with a dvd I cannot watch...I rate this no stars as I can't watch it....."
1,Want my money back,This movie was silly and a waste of time. Very boring and I could not finish. The positive reviews must be from friends of the Film makers. If this was free I would say you would lose nothing but your time. Don't pay the rental fee though.
2,ok,"i thought i was getting something scary but in the end it just did not make sense, poor poor movie"
3,Just ok,"I'd already seen this, on TV sometime. It's good enough to keep watching but that's about it. It's kind a like watching the Big Foot Hunters, you know how it's going to end but still watch it anyway"
3,Just okay,"About the same as a lot of the movies made in this style of ""real"" but not really real. Acting is okay, plot is fairly typical. I did enjoy it but.. Good for a night when nothing else is on."
4,Don't watch this in the dark.,"The movie is 1h33m long. I was pretty much on edge and jumpy for 1h15m. Yes, the movie is corny at the start and a rip of the guys on Ghost Adventures. But if you can bare with it for the first 15-20 minutes, they get ""locked in"" and the scares begin. I'm gonna have to sleep with the lights on tonight."
4,"Cheezy beginning, but soon evolves into a true scarefest!","I thought this was pretty well done. It starts off tongue-and-cheek and a bit over-the-top, true, but it's on purpose. Once they go to what they think will be yet another letdown, things start picking up and escalating quickly. Imagine ""1408"" without the personal background and the happy ending. This was freaky and worth watching!"
4,Trippy film in a scary way,Actually when I first started watching this film I thought it was going to be terrible. But after about half the way through there are plenty of scares and wicked beasts that a ghost hunting crew run into while investigating an old asylum. I cannot wait to see what the directors will put out next. Definitely worth a watch and it's a whole hell of a lot better than that paranormal activity crap.
2,Just Ok,At first you think this movie is really good and starts out then it gets super ridiculous as far as believability. So much it is quite fake. Just ok overall and honestly turned it off at the end which I never do normally.
1,Total Garbage!!,"This is a useless waste of time. No plot, no point.Everyone dies horribly. Poorly acted and filmed. Totally stupid!"
3,Mashed Potato...,"As a fan of the original film I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. Though not as edgy as the first this rendition didn't shy away from the content or occasional seedy remark, either. I tend to wear thin as musicals but the director did a great job balancing dialogue with dance numbers. All in all a pretty fun flick considering one moment it makes fun of Americana then attempts to make philosophical statements the next."
5,Who Doesn't Love It When Underdogs Come Out On Top?,"This is a great feel good musical with a real message. I couldn't quite picture John Travolta in fat padded drag until I actually saw it but he does a great job as Edna and even manages to capture a bit of the Baltimore accent. All the parts are well cast and Seinfeld fans will enjoy seeing two of that shows ""older"" supporting players on screen again along with teen idols Zac Efron and Amanda Bynes as well as proven stars like Travolta, Christopher Walkon, Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah. The music and dancing in the show are a lot of fun and the authentic period costume design is superior. Lots of subtle visuals such as a woman scrubbing the famed white marble steps of her row house really set the tone of Baltimore in the early 60's. But the film's good heart and messages of tolerance, acceptance and ultimate victory for the underdogs who believe in themselves and do what is right are what will make this musical an enduring classic."
5,Love It,I love this movie. It is fun and fast paced with wonderful music. John Travolta is a hoot as a mom.
3,Amazon Unbox version OK for a buck,"Conceptually, the convenience of downloading a movie for 99 cents to my Tivo HD is pretty cool... amazed that Hairspray painlessly ""arrived"" on my Tivo with a few simple clicks after setting up my account and placing the order. Beyond that, I'd be hard pressed to pay more than a buck for a couple of reasons: 1)Resolution was limited to 480i & 2)After movie started playing, rental download could only be accessed for 24 hrs.Give me HD resolution (at least 720p, 1080 preferred) a few more days of activated viewing window and I'll gladly pass on renting DVDs!!! ;-)BTW, Audio/Music Mix on download version of Hairspray was great... no complaints in that dept."
2,Entertaining but nothing like the original,"If you enjoyed the original as much as I did, you probably won't like this version."
1,Tricked,"I clicked on ""DVD's"" in the search box and believed this product WAS a DVD! I did not EXPECT a child's toy associated with the musical ""Hairspray"". I'm donating them to charity and will be way more careful the next time I order anything. Yes, I'm very disappointed! I have also received no notification what-so-ever concerning the FREE for one month postage trial which I've tried to cancel twice. Please CANCEL this service which is not a service at all to me. Thank you."
2,I don't use hairspray,"Hairspray really disappointed me.The humor was consistently crude, and more mean spirited than clever. The music, though peppy and upbeat, was unmemorable. The costumes and sets were beautifully 1960's, but the way people talked and behaved reminded me of sit coms from the 1990's. It didn't charm me.For a film about fighting prejudice, it certainly reinforced a lot of negative stereotypes! Although African-Americans and overweight people were championed, it was open season on high school teachers, fundamentalist Christians, the police, television executives, and beauty pageant winners.The film did have a few good moments. For one thing, that little Taylor Parks sure can dance! She lit up the screen! Wow!But that's not enough for me to recommend the movie in general."
1,unacceptable,"I am not sure what the problem is, but this particular movie would not play in our dvd player. I asked for a replacement, and the next one did not play in our dvd players as well."
1,Hairspray,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this film. I was expecting a humorous recap of the 50' - 60's. I felt the weight issue was over blown, and other points were extremly exaterated."
1,Won't play properly on Linux,"I was not able to watch this DVD because it refuses to play on Linux. If you want to watch a movie using Free Software, avoid this DVD.It does work OK in a standard DVD player, so I did not return it (because the person I was giving it to owns a DVD player too.)"
1,Buyer Beware!,"The first disc of the Two-Disc Shake and Shimmy Edition will not load properly. The second one does. Experienced this with 2 different DVD machines.Could get the first disc to load to a Wwindows XP machine DVD, but performance was very poor and machine eventually hung. Tried using the advanced features which did not work. The 'advanced features' and performed unauthorized installs/changes to the XP machine. Had to use Norton GoBack to restore functionality and remove changes.Doesn't Newline recall what Sony was sued over? You can't install / change peoples machines without their permission! I guess they just don't care.Too bad because I was looking forward to the DVD."
1,Damaged Goods,the DVD was all scratched and it is a pain to pack up the whole thing and send it back just because the DVD is damaged. This is the second DVD I have ordered that was all scratched up they were both loose in the box are these seconds???
1,Serious Nonsense,"Hairspray seemed to have been a West side story gone foolish. Please, were there no white fat women available to act the part of the white fat mama? Travolta was a Travesty as John turned Joan, goodness me is this what happens when actors go into menopause? Leave this sort of thing to Eddie Murphy who has already perfected it. Additionally, the big deal made over overweight people during the sixties is another nonsensical flim flam. During the sixties people were not so weight conscious as they are now. In fact skinny people were considered unattractive. The Travesty and his big white behind dancing on stage on TV would have been so laughable it would not even be considered. I am not going to spend any more time on this review, suffice it to say, I wasted my time going to the theatre."
4,A good remake,"I saw it and didn't like it as much as the original. However, I still did enjoy it and my niece loved it."
5,the best cheer up therapy,If you're in a cloudy day and feeling blue it's the best remedy you can find
4,Very Impressed,"Let me say, first off, that I'm not the typical kind of person who would watch thing kind of movie. I don't care for musicals or plays, so I didn't know what to expect before I began this movie. With that said, I found it to be highly entertaining, and fun throughout the entire film. The girl who played the main character (the name escapes me) was outstanding. John Travolta as a woman was humorous, but believable. Great cast, fun songs, all together a very fun movie."
5,Gr8 Movies,"This is a really great movie as well as laugh out loud funny, and John Travolta at his best. A must have for Musical lovers."
5,loves it,I listened to the cd once before going to see the movie and i loved it! The music was so good and the singing was also good! If you didn't see it in the threater than you should rent it b/c it was a freaking good movie.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE STAGE VERSION,"I see a lot of Broadway shows but had missed this one until last summer when I got to see it done live onstage. I didn't really think I'd care for it but I had a really good time. The music definitely captures the sound and the feel of the early 60s. The movie is not as good as the stage version. Too many ""subtle"" changes in the plot and you can't watch the mother without thinking THAT'S JOHN TRAVOLTA??? It's one thing to watch it ""live"" and know THAT'S A MAN? But to know it's a 'star' detracts from the overall effect. It's still fun and the music is basically good but not a first choice."
4,enjoyed the performances,If you like musicals you will like this movie. I think they did a good job on this remake and I really enjoyed John Travolta.
5,Christmas gift,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas who like me loves musicals. She'll be ecstatic! She lo es Zach efron
3,Not the origional Hair Spray :,It was not the origional one so I'm giving it a rating of 3 . I liked it but not as much as origional Hair Spray Movie inwhich I thought I had ordered.Thanks
4,Singing....In Baltimore....lmao,This was a funny movie. Quite suprised on how great it actually was. Never saw the play but heard this is as close as you get to the play.
4,Very Funny - A good rental!,"I downloaded this to my Tivo and had no problems with the download. The picture quality was also quite good. I knew the premise of the movie, but I didn't know that Travolta was actually playing Mom in drag. That truly made the movie. I also thought Walken did a nice job as dad. I am not much for musicals, but this was very enjoyable from start to finish. I recommend it for a nice afternoon."
1,hAIIRSPRAY-2 DISC,"i WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.I WAS UNABLE TO VIEW IT BECAUSE IT HAD WHITE SMUDGES ON THE PLAYNG SIDE AND WOULD NOT PLAY.i RETURNED IT TO AMAZON FOR ANOTHER ""HAIRSPRAY"".iT TOO HAD THE SAME DAMAGES,AND WAS RETURED TO YOU FOR A CREDIT,THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO GET IT LOCALLY.IMISTAKENLY ORDERED A THIRD COPY WITH THE SECOND AND HAD IT SENT TO MY DAUGHTER.THE QUALITY IS OKAY.I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS EXPERIENCE.J.AUSTIN"
1,Flat,"I'm shocked that this film got so many favorable reviews. It's flat and uninspired, nowhere near the accomplishment of Moulin Rouge, Chicago, Dreamgirls, or Sweeney Todd."
1,Terrible movie,"I rented the 2007 Hairspray movie last night and it bored me to tears. I started the movie, and within 15 minutes, I paused it, going to the kitchen to get a snack, going onto the computer. When I finally got back to the TV to watch the rest of it, I decided that I had had quite enough and turned it off. This movie does not compare to John Water's 1988 Hairspray. John Water's 1988 movie BLOWS this one away! The cast is better, the music is better, it is campier, it is non-stop hilarity! The cast includes Ricki Lake, Deborah Harry, Sonny Bono, Jerry Stiller, Pia Zadora, and of course Mink Stole and DIVINE (the star of this movie)!!! NO ONE can play Edna Turnblad like Divine and NO ONE can play Tracy Turnblad like Ricki Lake. Honestly....no one should ever try to remake a John Water's film. If you have not seen the 1988 Hairspray, please rent it and you will see what I am talking about."
1,An Ugly Movie,"I can't stand the constant, in your face ugliness of the lead character or John Travolta, who must be desperate to fill-up his personal airliners. Too many sterotypes too."
1,Like a fruitcake minus the fruit...and the cake,"The one and only star rating was for Christopher Walken.That aside, how could anyone NOT notice that what made the 1988 version great was totally missing? -The killer handpicked original music like Foot Stompin by the Flares, Madison Time by the Ray Bryant Combo, the Gong Gong song by the Ikettes and Shake a Tail Feather by the Five Du-Tones.... Plus the authentic choreography that went along with it?I mean the movie's about the influence blacks had on Rock and Roll and how white parents couldn't deal with it - so how's that come across with this Chitty Chitty Bang Bang score by Marc Shaiman?This was more like a Grease remake, complete with John Travolta trying to fill Divine's very high heels- I have bolster pillows that could have given a better performance.Ugh. Poor John Waters. He must be hurling big chunks."
2,Dull - - I walked out,"Maybe a movie can be comedy, ironic satire, and musical all at once, but it's a tough balancing act to pull off.For example, the opening song ""Baltimore"" should be hilarious - - the whole idea of singing in delight of a famously dull city - - but instead drags on too long and can't quite decide whether to be serious about itself. In fact, all the songs last too long. I suppose that speaks to the quality of the song writing (""is the damn thing over yet?"").Or consider the domestic scenes, exaggerated proletarian misery in wildly perky pastels. Is it supposed to be misery? Or Disney Channel comedy? or a mockery of misery? In the end it looks like they wanted to make fun of miserable conditions, while still being nice to them, but also not being too scary for the kids in the audience or offending the sponsors (god forbid the movie should have the ferocity of, ahem, a John Waters film).Can't review the entire movie because I walked out after about 20 minutes of this idiocy."
3,"Missing ""angel""","Not as good as expected.The star lacks""Angel"", I mean making herself loved by the viewer. Some good songs. Travolta is a good actor, but this role could have been played perfectly by a woman. Nothing justifies otherwise. I know that as a Broadway Show this character was also played by a man. Why????"
2,Okay but nowhere near the quality of broadway,"After I saw the Broadway version of hairspray, I was smiling; on an immediate high that lasted for weeks. I was excited to see this movie especially with the addition of zac efron to an already pretty amazing cast. When the soundtrack was realizes I was SHOCKED to discover that Mama, I'm a big girl now was not on the soundtrack, a staple a felt to the Broadway show. When I saw the movie in theaters it just went downhill. Nikki Blonsky seemed energetic and cute enough but right from the start she didn't do justice to the play. Nobody did. My favorite scene is Ladies's Choice, a scene that was not in the broadway play so there was nothing to ruin. I was disappointed with the movie, it was good enough but the play is way better"
2,ENJOYABLE,"fair acting.John Travolta is very good OK story line, an entertaining movie, nothing to get excited over. very fifties............ it is missing something like directing and better story line...........very teenie bopper"
1,Awkward!,"That's the best description for this movie; awkward. Watch the dvd for the 1988 version of Hairspray which is outrageously funny and I would say a cult classic and compare it to this one. Only then will you realize it's an awkward movie because it completely fails to surpass, to meet and to even stand up to the 1988 version for so many reasons I really don't feel like typing so much.Do yourself a favor and purchase the 1988 version and hopefully one day it will come out in BLU-RAY!1988 Version of Hairspray in BLU-RAY AMAZON! : D I've been looking for it for a long time!"
5,Great Musical,I have highly enjoyed this movie. I would highly reccomend Hairsparay if you liked Grease...
5,Hairspray = awesome,"The Hairspray shake and shimmy edition edition dvd is awesome!!! The disks look like mini records, oh so cute!! I havent even looked at the special features on it yet, but the movie alone was worth the moneys! and the dvd cover looks waay better than the normal dvd!! Buuuy it"
4,It's good in Blue-Ray,"This product has used the advantage function of blu-ray, makes it good to watch, and easy to look for what audience want. It's easy to find every song, and it has soundtrack to listen."
3,I love this version of HAIRSPRAY but!,"The reason I gave HAIRSPRAY 2007 just 3 stars is, because the streaming was very choppy. I truelly love and ador this version of HAIRSPRAY. I am wondering if anyone else had streaming problems?"
2,the package was broken,i cant put the disc on the package because is broken and if i leave it in the disc will be loose and might get damage. i have a picture of the product
1,this movie stinks and it does not deserve even one star,"This 2007 version of Hair Spray is neither funny nor does it give an authentic picture of the 60s. In case no one else has noticed the music in this camp version is strictly 70s disco. The 2007 movie is also over-produced.The 1988 John Waters ""Hairspray"" is so much better that there is no comparison plus the music in the 1988 movie is completely authentic. Being 12 in 1962, I recognized all of the music and remember watching ""American Bandstand"" which it spoofed. Motor Mouth Mabell seems to have been based on Detroit's own ""Martha Jean, the Queen,"" even though it ostensibly took place in Baltimore.As for casting: the guys in the ""lady's choice"" line up, I could swear I knew in high school, casting did such a good job. From the costumes, to the music, to the casting, to the funny lines, to Sonny Bono's acting the 1988 version blows the 2007 version ""out of the water."" In short, this 2007 camp extravaganza STINKS."
2,Disappointing Remake of Retro Dance Movie,"Hollywood should have left the original version alone, the remake is just awful and loses the spirit of the play. It is full of energy and starts out fresh, but soon gets bogged down with a overdoing a heavy message on racism, which the first movie kept in perspective for a light and fluffy teen musical.It was fun to look back through rose-colored glasses at 1962 and overall simplistic view of the times. The first movie was better - even though this version of ""Hairspray"" was fun seeing John Travolta in drag."
3,Hairspray - What were they thinking?,"Great cast of actors wasted their time on this ""want to be a hit"" movie. They tried...but it just didn't make the grade. I guess the time for good musical comedy or Hollywood spectactulars has passed. Even John Travolta couldn't save this one."
1,john REVOLT-A,"Why was John Travolta cast in this part? He's ""the elephant in the room"", and it's not just the fat suit. What a pathetic job of acting, or rather lack of acting."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME,"Yet another great movie ruined by Broadway and then back to film. Another great example, ""The Producers"". Two perfectly well written ,well acted and well made movies that couldn't be left alone by the (""The we have no original ideas left money grubbing pigs"".) Made in to Broadway musicals with new songs and new shtick. The original Hairspray was a great movie with great music. It was very quirky which is what you would expect from John Waters. If you are a fan of the original, you'll hate this."
4,Not Bad,i bought this movie for the wife. i thought it was pretty good. the cast was pretty talented. it was different thant the original movie but i expected that.
2,not funny,"Way to serious was not funny like the live musical, travlota playing the mothers role stright just strange, singing was good"
2,Average,"Glad this was on video so I could skip through the slow parts. The dance numbers are great, a few songs are fun, and the rest is filler."
5,Superb!,"I love this movie! It is so much fun to watch, the songs are very catchy and fun, and it makes me smile every time I think about it."
5,Hairspray dvd,"I purchased the dvd ""Hairspray"" for my daughter for Christmas. She watched at home and brought it to me for me to watch. This is an excellent show and had good service from Amazon in getting it to me."
5,I love musicals,"This musical is fun, and broaches the important issues of segregation and judgment about a person based on external appearances."
5,great movie,The movie is great. I loved Queen Latifah's performance and the songs she sang.Hairspray (Full-Screen Edition)
4,So funny!,This is a good remake of the original. John Travolta is hilarious. The whole cast did a great job!
5,Modern musical,Superb movie if like musicals.... I have not seen a good one in a while and this one is great... would recommend this one!!!!
5,One of the Best Musicals of the 21st Century!!!,"From John Waters comes one of the best musical of the 21st century, Hairspray! The new 2007 version follows the story of Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) who has dreams of dancing. When she, finally, gets the chance to audition to be a dancer in the Corny Collins Show, Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer) does not approve. She faces problems up ahead. Can she solve those problems and still be a good dancer? Find out in this movie which also stars Zac Efron, Queen Latifah, John Travotla, and many more. Hairspray is a truly good musical."
4,My daughter was thrilled with this gift!,This made christmas for my daughter. She has loved the movie since she first saw it and has constantly been asking for anything to do with it. What a wonderful idea!
5,Loved it,"I didn't think I'd be interested in this movie but I ended up absoutely loving it. I've never seen the play so it was completely new to me. I loved the music and the humor. This is a movie that will put you in a good mood for sure. All the lead characters were great but for me, it was the supporting characters that really made this a great movie. James Marsden, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer, and others were all great! I did feel though that John Travolta was miscast. He doesn't have a good singing voice and he seemed to be trying to be Mike Myers. If they're going to have a male for the role, I think Myers would have be perfect for it. But Travolta was still good."
4,"remakes rarely stink in my eyes, this is no exception","John Waters, I admire your work, but this film almost surpasses your film. John Travolta in drag? Who would've thought! The whole cast shines in this film-now I want to see the original again and the play. I wouldn't expect so many people and critics to enjoy this but they did! The music numbers esp. are really good, some actors I never imagined could sing, surprised me, because they could.Anyone who doesn't like musicals, should at least give this chance, but don't expect a scene-for-scene remake of the 1988 version, this one stands alone."
1,ZoneAlarm AntiVirus,"One can not separate the antivirus from the firewall. If you would like to continue to use the firewall, but not the antivirus you must delete the whole thing. The antivirus is not that good, it missed a virus that (free) Trend remote scanner caught."
3,"Good product, but you can get AVG totally free","ZoneAlarm Antivirus is a solid product, way better than the buggy and insecure Norton/Symantec Antivirus. ZoneAlarm AV installs smoothly and appears to work silently protecting your PC from virus (but not sinister spyware).However, you might as well go download the totally free AVG Free Edition 7.5 on Grisoft's website. You get free daily update with AVG for life. One caveat: it's free only for personal use, not business use."
3,Troublesome software updates,"I been using Zone Alarm Anti-virus for a couple years. It comes with firewall and antivirus software. Both firewall and antivirus works great... before any software updates. A software update happens when Zone Alarm publishes a new version of software that completely replaces this software. You will be notified when there is a new software ready to download and run. The update happens every three to four months.The problem is, every time I update my Zone Alarm Antivirus, I ran into software problem that prevent AV from running, at all. Every time, I had to send email to customer service to get help. The turnaround time, from the minute i have problem, to the time the problem gets fixed ranges from several hours to several days. During that time, my computer was NOT protected from virus, at all.Zone Alarm is good when it works. But beware of the software updates.. it might piss you off."
1,Toast crashes,I cannot get Toast 7 to compress aTS file with out it crashing under Tiger. If it worked it would be great. Very disappointed.
1,Rebate Ignored-Customers mean zero!,"This is a great product, but Sonic Solutions (Roxio) bought this product a few years ago from Adaptec and does not seem to care anything about customer service. Good luck getting your rebate money, I have read many reports of this theft. It does not matter how many versions you have purchased over the years, they do not care about you. I was even locked off their forum when I complained. There is no email, it's automatic and you get a no reply address, the phone contact is on your dime to Canada, and about as useful as ants at a picnic.I come away feeling this company doesn't care about Mac products and Mac customers, why don't they sell to someone who does? It's a shame a good product must be so badly represented. Sonic, you guys are horrible!"
5,Provides the missing piece for Mac OS,"Toast provides the missing piece to Mac OS, allowing you to use an outside burner and speeding up the processes, especially when dealing with a powerbook or older iMac.The interface is simple, the process is quick and intuitive. Don't let the restrictions of an older burner or the absence of a burner prevent you from fast and easy DVD and CD authoring. Get yourself an external burner (most are very reasonably priced for less than $100) and write your way to a sensational audio/video library."
3,It's alright but...,"It's alright but there are free open source applications and some nearly free free apps that have most if not all of the features Toast has though they aren't necessarily bundled together.Examples: Disco, Max, Burn, LiquidCD to name a few (do a web search for them).They are also less bulky and offer a few features Toast doesn't. If they don't work for you then I'd buy Toast as a last resort."
1,What the...?,"Okay. I have also had all of the Titanium 7 problems reported by others; namely, I keep getting messages that I am not registered, and when I try to register, I can't because they (Roxio) don't recognize my password. Open a new account? Not so fast, tech-boy! You'll be stymied at every turn by this unfriendly software. BUT-the very worst thing of all which I didn't see mentioned in any of the Amazon product reviews or noted in the product specifications is that Roxio/Toast no longer supports iTunes. This means that if you wish to burn music purchased through iTunes downloads, you will get an error message and won't be able to make the CD. This alone is worth boycotting this product. Don't say I didn't warn you. Save yourself the money and look elsewhere...or just burn from the Mac software in iTunes."
1,Poor results and poor support,"I've been using Toast for a number of years and was anxious for the upgrade. What a disappointment! While the DVDs always work on my computer, the disks work only on select stand-alone DVD players and then only sometimes. Tried to work with support and was told if I wanted the software to work everytime, I should purchase a professional film product.The only other product I was more frustrated with was Popcorn and Roxio has refused to provide a refund."
4,pleased with this purchase,"This is exactly what I wanted to help with my own individual bible study as well as with my small group. I agree with the others who have offered their comments that there are more complete volumes out there for the extremely serious student of the bible, but this is perfect for the average church-goer studying at home."
5,I love It,"This is alway,s a plus because any thing that help you study God,s word is a plus Strong and Vine or the best out there so i to ask that you try it you will love it for the many good studying you will do."
5,Just what I was looking for,My wife needed a concordance for home Bible study. I chose this one because it also came with the dictionary. I didn't realize how big of a book it was. It was just what we were looking for and more.
4,Great book,This book is so great. I can look up anything I want and find my answer. Thanks so much I love it.
4,A very strong and concise concordance and dictionary all in one.,This is my first concordance & dictionary combined together. I found it very useful and helpful for all my daily needs/reads.
4,Aone,This dictionary arrived in great condition from Amazon that was the only site that carried it.The book is easy to read and it surprised me with the extent of its content.I look forward to using it in my studies.
4,Memorex 2 GB flash drive,Good value for the money. Copied 50 MB in 15 secs. Probably not the fastest on the market but does the job.
2,Slow-Slow-Slow,"Tons of space at a good price. But, it is painful to use. It takes 20% longer to copy 1GB of data to my hard drive then my 1GB lexar media drive. Using this drive to support my quicken files is painful. Everything with this drive takes too much time."
1,Overpriced piece of junk,"There is not much to a jump drive, but everything about his one is wrong. It is slippery so easy to drop. The cap is transparent, so it is very easy to lose. It sometimes (randomly) isn't recognized by my PC. It is slow.I have many other jump drives, and this is the worst by far. What more can I say - look elsewhere and skip this one!"
4,4 Stars,"Gr8 product for a reasonable price have no complaint about the product whatsoever will recommend to any intensional buyer, i really wanted to give 5 stars but i remember it didn't have a vault which would of done the magic."
4,Sleek and works as expected,"Each of my two children needed a flash drive for school this year so I purchased this and the Kingston 2GB DataTraveler. Both are about the same price. The Memorex worked great right out of the box. It is heavier and bigger than the Kingston, but this one includes the Lanyard."
4,Great Product,"Nice, simple piece of hardware - easy to use and easy to take for granted.Only issue in hindsight: I bought the one gig version and I should have popped the extra money to get a larger size drive - at least this size of two gig. Amazing how you run out of space quickly here..."
1,Too much bother to use.,"I don't how well USB drives should work, but I've had mine for weeks and have yet to back up any files on them because they keep giving me ""error"" messages and failing to copy my image files. I can only transfer one image at a time and the drives are slow. These looked like the best bet for using with my Mac computer, but burning CDs is easier and faster!"
1,Just flat doesn't work!,"I bought a second Traveldrive because the first one purchased worked just fine. The second drive does not work on my system (Windows Millenium). Calling the service line I found out that there are two versions and the second is not compatible with the first. After trying all the recommended solutions, the tech support suggested I request a warranty replacement/trade for the original version or simply get my money back. Requests for a resolution of the matter have fallen on deaf ears. I would not waste any more money on products from this company."
2,"Great storage, Lousy drive","I recently bought this drive because for the price, nothing else came close to storage capacity. I was upset when I got home and realized I could not easily remove the preinstalled partition with all the junk software on it. The device has what I call a ""mini-OS"" that you have to wait to load up each time you plug it in. It's neat at first but gets old quick when all you want to do is transfer some files. And most importantly, the speed of file transfer is lowsy imo, it seemed more like I was connected via usb 1.1, not 2.0.If you only care about storage vs cost, then it's a no brainer, get this drive. If you don't mind paying more for a better quality drive, then continue your search."
2,Very Slow,"This device is good except that it is very slow... the data transfer rate is really poor, 2 GB are transfered in about 30 minutes what is really bad."
4,Memorex 2 GB 2nd Generation USB 2.0 Travel Drive 32509070,A really good buy for persons who operate in a high graphics environment and need to store large graphic files frequently. This product has not disappoint.
2,"Good price, slow as molasses","This drive is fine in terms of form-factor, etc., but I was appalled to see that it took more than 3 minutes to copy a 1.7MB folder to it from my desktop on a dual 2.0 G5 using USB 2.0. That's unacceptable.As another reviewer said, if speed isn't an issue for you, the price is definitely right."
3,My Least Favorite Out of their 3 Albums but it still KICKS!,"Machine Head is a epic band! Their agression and use of Brutal, Dry Voacals, and Chrunching Guitars got me hooked from the start. This is a great album, however if you ask me it is nothing compared to Burn My Eyes, and The Burning Red. It gets more of a 3 and 1/2 from me. My favorite Tracks are Down to None, Take My Scars, Violate, Ten Ton Hammer, Spine, and Blood Of The Zodiac. I saw these guys with SlipKnot & Coal Chamber, and I'm seeing them again on Saturday! They give a KILLER Live Show! CHECK OUT BURN MY EYES IF YOU LIKE THIS ALBUM, ITS EVEN BETTER!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST HARD CORE CD EVER,THIS CD WILL GRAB YOU BY YOUR NUTS AND TOSS YOU AROUND. WATCH OUT FOR THE HARD CORDS.
5,Oh My Gosh............,"THIS IS THE BEST METAL ALBUM I`VE EVER HEARD....don`t ask me why........just listen to it........5 stars is too low rating, ya know....."
1,Pretty Horrid,"I hear many people claiming this was when Machine Headed started to lose it, but really ""it"" is was already completely lost. I will be the first to profess my love for the song ""Ten Ton Hammer"", but I was extremely disappointed with every other song on here. This albums predecessor ""Burn My Eyes"" is miles ahead of where this one is. If you like ""Burn My Eyes"" don't let other people fool you into thinking that this album is good, or even sounds anything like it."
5,Total heavy-metal music with a great sound!!,This is Machine Head's second album and it's just as good as their first. Robb Flynn's voice is just as powerful as their first and their sound is twice as heavy!
4,A Masterpiece,"""The More Things Change..."" is one of the best Machinehead CD's released. Standout tracks include ""Ten Ton Hammer"", ""Take My Scars"", ""Bay of Pigs"", ""Blood of The Zodiac"", and ""Spine"". Rob Flynn is an awesome vocalist. The guitars and bass are great too. However, sometimes the songs get boring and the drums aren't especially great. Other than that, this album is rocks!"
1,"Definitely heavy, but what happened to the music?","This CD is definitely heavy, but what happened to the music? This is the most UN-melodic CD I have heard in a long time. Every song is full of elementary, trite guitar riffs that any beginning guitarist or bass player should be able to cop/create. I gave this CD 5 painful listens then threw it in my CD graveyard pile to never be listened to again. Don't get me wrong, I love metal and heavy music, but there is MUCH better stuff out there."
4,"It's not ""Burn My Eyes"", but it sure is something","Machine Head virtually came out of nowhere with their instant classic debut album ""Burn My Eyes"". Old time metalheads responded with overwhelming joy to that album, and the band had quite a bit to live up to. In 1997, Machine Head released ""The More Things Change..."": a great album on it's own, but naturally paled in comparison to the band's brilliant debut. From 1995 on, the music scene became more and more watered down while bands like Pantera and Biohazard refused to change according to the musical climate and trends. While Machine Head eventually went the way of a more nu-metal sound further down the road, this album is still a testament of a once uncompromising band. ""Ten Ton Hammer"", ""Take My Scars"", ""Down to None"", and the epic ""Violate"" are all memorable tracks that display the band's once patented unending metal assault. It's not ""Burn My Eyes"" or even ""Burning Red"", but it's pretty close."
2,Absolutely Horrible...,"I have been a fan of Gilligan's Island for the last 30 years and when I finally received this DVD, I thought it was the next best thing to sliced bread. I was wrong though... As is stated by other customers here, the editing was absolutely horrible. A lot of the scenes were cut and it just ruined the whole movie. I gave it two stars because it is always good to see the cast of Gilligan's Island perform and this specific DVD did them no justice whatsoever. Shame on you to dishonor those actors and actresses that made Gilligan's Island as famous as it is today..."
1,Terrible on every aspect,"Now I group up watching Gilligan's Island re-runs and I loved them. We have even bought the remastered DVDs of all three seasons so our kids can watch them, and they love them too. But this DVD is just terrible.First off, the quality of the transfer is horrendous. I mean I can't imagine the original show looking this bad when it aired on TV. There are parts that are so dark that they are barely visible.Second, the plot is worse than any Gilligan Island episode written 15 years prior. Now I recognize that the plots are suppose to be far-fetched, but this was just dumb.Lastly, it was obvious that the actors were dragged into this. It was great seeing the cast aged, but they had all lost their original spark. I felt bad for them because it looked like they were just walking through their lines. Jim Backus, Mr. Howell looked like he could barely make it through a scene.Buy this DVD only if you must own everything about GI. Otherwise skip this one over"
2,Rescue From Gilligan's Island,"People Rescue From Gilligan's Island Was A Great Movie BUT......If You Want To Own It Buy It On VHS Not Dvd It Sucks On Dvd Because It Has Scenes Cut Out For Time,Bad Audio,And Faded Yellow Color VHS Is Good Because It Is Not Cut,And It Has Good Audio SO BUY IT ON VHS"
1,Poorest quality DVD I have ever seen.,"The film is OK because I've seen it before on TV, but the technical quality with which it is presented on the DVD is terrible. It looks like a 3rd or 4th generation bootleg copy--grainy, dark, low definition, faded color. I really have to question if producer Sherwood Schwartz or whoever holds the copyright actually licensed it for this DVD. The VHS version has to be better. I suspected the low price... was too good to be true--buyer beware."
4,Terrible transfer still fun to watch,"Using the term ""remastered"" for this release is misleading at best. The audio and video are terrible. The story is also weak and not up to par with any of the regular run material. But, it's still Gilligan's Island and fun to watch. If you are a Gilligan's Island fan and have a few bucks to spare why not get it. If you don't have the three regular seasons get one of them instead. Anyone waiting for a high quality version of this better not be holding their breath. Get it while you can before it goes out of print or someone decides it is a $100 collectors item. Now if we could just get the Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island, I would be happy."
1,return to gilligan's island,The video's sound is poor quality. Other than that the video is good. The delivery was AWFUL! There is no reason it should take 20 days to deliver a video. I have never had problems with deliveries when I ordered from Amazon. I will think long and hard before I order again.
4,this is the first movie after the series Gilligan's island,"Just sit right back and see the first t.v movie in the series of Gilligan's Island movies. In this movie, the castaways are finally rescued after fifteen years on their uncharted desert island. However the castaways have some difficulty in adapting to the change in the U.S. Eventually the Skipper take all the castaways on a reunion cruise and guess what happens, you guessed it, the castaways end up stranded on an island. unfortunatly, it is the same island they have been stranded on for fifteen years!! END"
2,"a sad rescue as the ageing castaways go one more time ""on a three hour cruse","i really wanted to like this movie because of the love i had for the show, but they waited to long to make it. the cast looks old tired and not very inspired as they limp through one more adventure and are finaly rescued. then we follow the captain as mr. howell calls him and gilligan as they vist each of their shipmate in their new lives and find they don't fit in anymore in a world that is about taking care of number one when they are use to helping each other and the greater good of all. that message is good it is just tied to some unfunny prat falls and jokes as gilligan loeses the kind hearted loveable loser gilligan and believe it or not they make him dumder than before and it is just a sad unfunny way to see the friends we grew up with end this ""three hour tour"" that said i give it two stars because my two boy watch it and have some fun but even they like the show better."
4,Get it on VHS if you buy it!!!!,The Quality is Better!The DVD does not have as much quality Go figure! :-)
2,depressing,i love the series. this is not worthy as an episode. very insulting to character after such series development on characters. No Ginger. No fun. Bob Denver deserved so much better of a series sendoff.
1,"Gilligan's Island, the rescue?","I have been a big fan of the show for many years but living in the UK meant that any exposure to the show was very limited.Now with the advent of DVD all the series are now available. I watched them all many times and eagerly awaited viewing ""Rescue From Gilligan's Island"".What a disappointment (and waste of good money) the picture quality is poor, the sound is poor and the editing looks like it was done by a child.Having said that it was worth watching a poor quality DVD just to see them get off the island.I'm sure a pirate copy would have been better quality!"
1,Poor Quallity and Cut Up Version,"As other reviewers have stated, this DVD is of poor quality and several minutes have been cut out. I'm fortunate enough to have a VHS tape of the uncut version (not broadcast copy). I transfered it to DVD using my Panasonic DVD recorder and it plays fine. The original movie length was 108 minutes compared to everything that has come out since in the order of 95 minutes. The DVD available today IS a transfer from the 95 minute tape with no enhancments whatsoever."
3,Rescue From Gilligan's Island,"It's cheesy but it's funny. The old Ginger was great, the one on this movie was not! Don't like the ending."
3,"Hmm, a different ending...","The ending was kind of surprising, I don't think I liked it, but maybe it was good for them under the circumstances.Basically, they didn't find the life off the island that agreeable since they were changed and since what was waiting for them was not what they dreamed about.I think I kind of liked watching this movie. I think if was fair."
2,"Great show, lousy dvd authoring.","Its too bad this great made-for-tv movie looks so bad on dvd. The picture quality is amazingly terrible. It looks like it was taped from a tv using a coathanger for a reception arial instead of cable. I kid you not! Its really that bad! I just saw RFGI broadcast on cable tv not to long ago and it looked 150% better than the DVD does. I know the source material is old, but thats just ridiculous.Unfortunatly, its a must-buy for Gilligan's Island fans, especially at this price!The DVD also has a bonus Little Rascals short 'Spooky Hooky', which has its own quality issues, but I wont go into that..."
3,"Gilligan's Island is back, and I LOVE IT!","This movie is so delightfully awful, that it is a bundle of fun! I mean, it is so dumb, that you can't help getting out of it's way! I mean, you will probably loose some brain cells watching it, but who cares! It is fun!They got most of the original cast back (except for Tina Louise) and it was so much fun to watch then back for more! I just wished that they had had a chance to make a few more (even though they did make two more--Harlem Globe Trotters--and Castaways on Gilligan's Island).Watch this movie, because it is a bunch of fun!"
1,When bad DVD happens to good people.,"Horrendous quality and appears to have been taken from an over-the-air broadcast or off of a VHS tape.One scene has a jump in it that appears to be caused by the recording not being restarted properly (on the VHS) or poor editing.There are no extras or special features relating to Gilligan's Island.Rescue From Gilligan's Island has always been a fun show for me, but this DVD lacks a lot.P>The only saving grace is the price!"
2,Good Movie / Bad Mastering,"The movie itself is really cute and has ""re-watchability"". My problem with the DVD is the mastering is TERRIBLE. Imagine taking a film made in 1978, transferring it to VHS about 10 years later (without cleaning the film), then taking that same VHS tape 10 years after that and transferring it to DVD; it really looks that bad. In fact, there are messed-up spots on the videotape that weren't cleaned up so you see a replay of creases in the master tape!BTW, the re-cast of Ginger pulled the movie down a star; what a bad actress."
1,SUPERBAD QUALITY,"I would not recommend this DVD to my worst enemy.The quality of the video is horrible. It's like you're watching it through a white bed sheet.The sound is lousy too........... as a matter of fact, for some strange reason the Gilligan theme song had been edited out... No kidding, in the title credit sequence and the ending titles sequence all you see is video, BUT NO AUDIO.... completely silent.To tell you the truth, even for a buck it cost too much for this trash.Save your dollar, peoples"
1,Bootleg Copy 4 Weeks Later No Credit After Return Of This DVD!,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE! IT IS CLEARLY A BOOTLEG COPY RAN STRAIGHT FROM A COMPUTER THEIFT DOWNLOAD! I HAVE SENT THE DVD BACK AND 4 WEEKS LATER NO CREDIT AND MY ORIGINAL REVIEW HAS BEEN NOT POSTED! I MAKE MOVIES FOR A LIVING AND AFTER THE WAY THIS SELLER HAS HANDLED MY ORDER AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR ALLOWING THIS SELLER TO REMAIN ACTIVE! ANY FBI OR TBI INVESTIGATING SELLERS ON AMAZON SHOULD CONSIDER THIS SELLER OF INREREST! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AND IF YOU DO GOOD LUCK!
1,Terrible,This tape was a remake. It was a terrible copy. It looked like it was taking from the movies. Waster of money.
2,Video quality was horrible,"This movie had a quality that felt like it had been recorded straight from the TV. No, on second thought, it wasn't that good. It had speckles and sparks (like you see in really old movies), the lighting and sound were horrible."
1,Junk,"""Junk"". Total junk less than VHS quality. DVD is faded and grainy... Sending it back to ImportCD. This DVD is pirated."
1,Westlake Edition is Garbage!,The Westlake edition is very poor quality; color faded with reds appearing orange. Good movie but the Westlake version is really hard to look at!
2,Rescue From Gilligan's Island,"This is a mildly enjoyable and cute movie. But if you are a fan of the original Gilligan's Island series, you will probably be disappointed in it. It takes place away from the pleasureable island where the heart of the original story belongs. Instead, the characters have returned ""home"" to face new dilemmas, and the plot was rather stupid. Well, not ""rather"" stupid... It WAS stupid! That's only my opinion. Enjoy!"
3,Good but not great,"Although it is great to see the castaways finally get rescued, the movie is not super funny. There are some hilarious physical gags, but the acting is mediocre. The castaways fianlly get rescued only to realize that they don't fit in with regular society anymore. If you are a huge fan of the show, this is a must own. Otherwise, you are better off renting it."
2,Only for fans of the original series,"I'm a fan of the original series, and generally not too critical of light-hearted movies like this, but I have to say that the writing for ""Rescue from Gilligan's Island"" is rather weak, to put it mildly. The jokes and dialogue are sloppy and not very funny, unless you're maybe 5 or 6 years old. Probably the worst scene is where Mrs. Howell suddenly calls out for a dog that she hasn't seen in years during the storm.....and Gilligan's wild reaction. Were the producers trying to give the impression that Mrs. Howell was going senile?? Still, it's nice to see the cast again after so many years, and to watch them get rescued."
1,DVD was unplayable,"Although I only paid less than $10, it is the principle that counts. I can't return an unplayable DVD because the statue of limitations has expired. Unfortunately, I didn't watch the DVD early enough so I have no means of a refund or a replacement."
1,Totally unsatisfied,"Last christmas I ordered all of the Gilligans island episodes from Amazon. I got all three seasons with no problem. The final episode, The Rescue was a bit of a problem to get. After 4 months they informed me that the only thing they could offer was a slim case dvd. I thought "" I don't mind what the case looks like"". So i took it. It is a ""home Burned copy"" that was very dark and hard to hear, it also quit working after about 20 minutes. The dvd itself is in great condition and not scratched or defective looking. I have ordered tons of stuff from Amazon and never seen such poor quality. And to top it all off my kids threw the shipping box away with my reciept in it. I wouldn't even rate this 1 star but the site made me so I could even write a review."
1,It looks like a copy of a copy. No way this was a new original,"It looks like a very poor copy of a copy. I notified the seller (multiple times) and he did not offer to refund or exchange it. Basically said ""too bad sucker"". Just another ripp-off. Avoid dealing with this seller."
3,not bad,It almost seems like it was cut and started up again and then you feel like you missed a part...
1,bad script,"This is a low budget film. The laugh track is removed - which Gilligan episodes always had - making it dull and lifeless. Other things could have been done just a little bit different and been exactly like the old Gilligan's island set - such as their huts. They were all totally different in this movie, making it seem not even related to the original show. I was also not impressed with Ginger's part after being rescued, when they wanted her in immodest dress doing immodest things. It was just such a poor script on their part that it is gross instead of funny. There is another movie entitled The Castaways from Gilligan's Island that has a laugh tract, care was taken to make things like the old Gilligan's Island and is much funnier. Get that one instead."
1,Absolute junk,"Oh, wow. I was really looking forward to seeing this after umpteen years and finally received it for Christmas, but I couldn't even watch it because the quality was so bad. It looks like it was sourced from a 2nd-generation VHS, which in turn was sourced from a dirty, scratched film print that wasn't even cleaned before being telecined. There is an unbelievable amount of dirt, grain, and sparkle on whatever print it was sourced from. The colors are faded, the tint is all wrong, and the image is very fuzzy and jitters a lot. The sound is muddled and displays severe clipping in several places. I'm 99.9% sure this was sourced from a VHS and not a film print, and whoever did it should be fired because I could have done a better job on my PC. Avoid at all costs and hope somebody does a proper release someday. For now, spend your money on one of the superb season sets instead."
2,buy the other companies copy of this movie,"There is another company that has released this movie on DVD complete with the theme songs and credits. If you are going to buy you would be better to give this one a miss, and look for the other DVD. It too is avail on Amazon."
2,Not very interesting,I couldn't sit through the whole thing. It was boring and repetitious to watch. Maybe is wasn't what I expected.
4,Thriller,Another good book by McBain. Fast pace and interesting. I found I couldn't stop reading just to see what happens next.
2,I was hoping for more,"I love police procedurals, especially ones where there is intelligent detecting by mostly likeable lead characters. Unfortunately, too much of the police work here happened ""off camera"" and the end went by in a blink. I felt cheated after trudging through the ""mood of the city"" descriptions and too many personal details. The conversations were nowhere near the Rex Stout level and nothing humorous anywhere. Especially wrong was the policeman's discussion with the reporter in the last chapter.(SPOILER ALERT)The detective gives the reporter his girlfriend's name and location ""off the record"" knowing the reporter is not to be trusted. Unbelievable.If this is the best one in the series, yikes."
3,Cop Hater,I enjoy reading Ed McBain stories. This one brought back the memory of the black and white TV show of years ago based on the books by McBain. They prove that a good story is still a good story no matter how long ago the books were first published. I think that if you like John Sanford or James Patterson books you would like the Ed McBain offerings as well.
3,An Interesting Read,This is the first novel I have read in Ed McBain's 87th precinct series. The book itself was actually released over forty years ago but for the most part the story ages well. Cop Hater was the first book in the classic series and it moves along at a quick and rapid pace. A little too quick and rapid for my tastes. Fans of the series will be overjoyed at the chance to relive this early book but for those of us who are reading McBain for the first time Cop Hater is just an average read. There are some flashes of great writing but over all this book did not engage me. Good interseting read but not great.
4,The 87th Precinct novels are the primer for all crime-police novels that followed.,"Even today the McBain novels withstand the test of time, consistent style, easy to read, follow established Police Practice of the time. Now they have history ingrained for the ""way things were""."
3,Cop Hater,Typical 87th precinct novel. It is the first of the series of approximately 50 novels. There is a recent introduction by the author which really adds insight and value to this read.
2,oldie,"I prefer the newer 87th Precinct stories. The charactors are much more interesting and more human. But, I'll read any of them because I love Steve Carrelli."
4,Surprisingly good.....,I really enjoyed this book. I didn't really know what it was about and then when I saw it was s we t years and years ago I didn't think I'd like it but I did. Good mystery.
4,Cop Hater,"Really enjoyed this book, loved the details, didn't suspect the villain!Very enjoyable and quickly read! Have to get more in this series"
3,Good cop story.,"It was good, kept me interested and I did finish it. But I don't think I'll read another by this author."
3,Solid Police Procedural,"Holds up well almost 50 years after publication. Story a little predictable, but the characters, dialog, and pacing are good."
2,What a disappointment,"I've seen Ed McBain books for years and decided to give one a try when it was a daily special. It was a struggle to read, took forever to finish and I doubt I'll read another of his. I'm glad it was on sale!"
3,OK for an old-timer,"I read all of Ed McBain's Precinct books years ago, and this one was sort of Middle-of-the road. Thanks for offering them."
4,A Good Start,"I haven't read these 87th Precinct novels in any kind of order, but...this one is certainly well done and although it was written nearly 50 years ago, it's a great start. A quick engaging read, with a surprising ending. Enjoy."
5,"""GREAT""","This is the first McBain book I have read. Like to read a series in order but guess this one will be hard to do as so many are out of print. I thought it was a great read. It was short enough I did not have to wait days to get to the end. I really like the characters. Carella and Teddy are very good. You could almost feel like you were there. Just everyday folks, some doing good and some doing bad. No big macho thing just like what would happen anywhere in any town. If you like a good mystery, a quick read and good characters you will like this book. Sure hope I can find the next one."
4,Interesting to read how differently the police function in some things,Interesting to read how differently the police function in some things. Well written and a good plot. I enjoyed it very much.
2,Returned this book,Could not get into it. Slow Slow Slow. Could not recommend it at all. Not my cup of tea at all
4,Cop Hater,Excellent read. First book I have read by McBain. Most certainly won't be the last. Enjoyed it very much indeed.
4,Review of Cop Hater,This is my first book read on Kindle. Easy to read. Good story. I chose it because I've read other McBain novels.
4,Good new story line.,Enjoyed and would recommend. A little much of the description of the buildings and surrounding area but understood the necessity. Carleneverrilli
4,Excellent read!,I like the way Ed McBain writes. This book is over 50 years old and still very interesting to read.
4,Classic but timeless,I have not read many police procedurals but McCain has clearly created something very special. A unique cast of characters. A bold style. Despite its age the book feels so timeless. You can easily see why he is such a prolific writer. I look forward to reading more of his books.
1,truely an embarassment,"This is pure drivel, catering NOT to Christians, but only to theabsolute LUNATIC FRINGE.Ridiculous, on every level, from it's misguided theology and half-bakedeschatology to it's high school level script, ponderous acting,amateurish direction, lighting, audio and cinematography. The only goodthing about this movie is it's length. Short enough for concernedChristians to critique in classes about heresy and also short enoughfor atheists, agnostics and non-believers to get a good laugh.REAL Christans will NOT find this movie enlightening. It has absolutely NOtheological value and is an embarrassment. This movie very rightlycauses derision by agnostics, atheists and non-believers because it isso incredibly bogus. This is the ""Reefer Madness"" of the End of Times"
5,Remanufacture,The Remanufacture album was the next level of remixes following Fear is the Mindkiller. If you have an open mind and enjoy something different from the normal metal then Remanufacture is an album to own.
2,Ecclectic & totally different from previous albums,"FF decided to release a remix album of ""Demanufacture"". Hearing new versions from the excellent ""Demanufacture"" seems great, but the result is quite disturbing: the tracks were remixed by many ""techno celebrities"" who all have their style. This album is therefore incoherent, ranging from boring factory noises, to gabber (ultra hardcore techno), to quite good tracks. Track 6 is my favorite. Fatboy Slim, Junkie XL and others worked on this album. It's great to innovate, but it's a bit too experimental for me!"
2,Interesting idea...,"Although this is an interesting idea, it doesn't quite work. I'll admit first off I'm not a fan of remixes for the most part, so maybe I'm biased. For some reason, Fear Factory sought to have every song (with the exception of Dog Day Sunrise, since it's a cover) from the jewel-case version of Demanufacture remixed. Sometimes it works out good, such as Genetic Blueprint (New Breed), Remanufacture (Demanufacture) and Cloning Technology (Replica). But these tracks are really the only things worth listening to on this album, unless you're a remix freak. I don't recomend this album except for the most diehard of Fear Factory completists, like myself."
1,a fall from creativity,"With the release of Remanufacture, Fear Factory sunk to an unexpected low. Demanufacture was great. The lyrics and the music had something original. With the onslaught of Remanufacture, creativity was lost. The songs were no longer works of art but reprocessed and stale."
3,Different but Cool,This FF album isn't nearly as col as the other ones but has a unique sound to it. almost worth the money.T-100 and Machines of Hate are the best tracks. it has a large range of Techno-type music some tracks are slower and less hard core but some of the tracks are ULTRA-HARDCORE-HEAD-EXPLODING-TECHNO. it's an experiment gone bad for the most part.
4,it `s alright,I don`t have this version i have the reissue of demanufacture with this oone in it but i desided to write them sepertly.I think is ok but what i dont like is that with a corny dance beat with the chorus repeated a hundred times bothers me but some of the remixes are really cool like remanufacture and others but i wish they put the remixes in order of the album so id know what song it is.I like fear factorys industrial side and this is cool that you get the full album thats awesome.Demanufacture was awesome this one is ok if you really like demanufacture get this one or obselete
2,"If you like Fear Factory, don't buy this.","Demanufacture is one of my favorite fear factory albums, it is second only to archetype. But when i heard the remixes of remanufacture i was completely horrified. As a metal head, i was very disapointed when i first heard the big electric dance beats kick in(very out of place). This album is far from any metal I've ever heard, and if you're like me, a true metal head, dont waste another second on this album. Hopefully like me, you will enjoy Fear Factory much more when they are actually playing their instruments and not the synthesizer. Buy ""DE""manufacture!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this mouse because I work with a laptop at work and wanted to get an external mouse. The mouse requires 4 AAA rechargeable batteries but only came with 2. I bought a pack of rechargeable batteries, put 2 in the base and 2 in the mouse as instructed. Everyday when I booted up my computer I had to press the connect buttons on the bottom of the base and mouse to sync them up. What a pain! I wrote to Adesso's customer service and the response I got was so lame the person obviously didn't even read what I had painstakingly taken the time to write. I threw the mouse in a desk drawer and bought a new one. I just came across the mouse and decided I'd try it on my home computer--thinking it might have had something to do with my laptop. Same problem! This Adesso mouse is now going to add to a local landfill!"
5,Little Maid Series,I read these books when I was growning up. I hope they are still around for my grandkids. I thought all of them were wonderful!
4,How to NASCAR-up you prayers,"Everyone drives -- but few drive like the NASCAR drivers. This book on prayer may help turn you from a regular-praying Christian to a 200-MPH prayer machine!Mr. Laurent's dissection of the clumsiness of the average prayer, and his tune-up tips for prayer efficiency can help us all toward God's Grace. Following his tips is like pouring carb cleaner in your prayer tank -- it cleans a lot of gunk out of the pipelines, and gives your prayer more horsepower, torque, and most important in this day and age, more MPP (Miles Per Prayer.)If you feel your prayers have been answered sluggishly, this book could put you back in the race. Read it, and I'll race you to the finish line!"
2,Prayer and the Diagrams of Force,"A savagely funny book. A must read for the Christian far right. Save your time. Save God's time. Learn to hone your skills as a lean, mean, prayin' machine. In this fast pace age of instant information and on demand media access, why waste your time - or God's, with meaningless, time consuming dribble. ""Prayer and the Diagrams of Force"" will teach you the practices and principles of parsimony when seeking devine intervention."
5,You'll never forget Gussie,"A touching story centered on a truly genuine character, Gussie (Agusta) Locke, a woman as much a part of Wyoming as the wind. William Haywood Henderson's lush descriptions, his poetic excursions into Gussie's imagination are unforgettable. Worth reading again and again to savor not only the author's eye for detail but the beautifully crafted prose."
3,Not for me,I think I'm just not a fan of this type of novel. It was our reading group's selection of the month. But I never really understood the motivation of Gussie. The daughter's characterization was interesting.
5,Strong and authentic heroine; beautiful prose,"Fastidiously researched historical novel with a strong and authentic character in Gussie Locke. Beautifully rendered natural setting (Colorado and Wyoming and Minnesota). Grimm's fairy tale elements resonate in the context of wide open spaces and a child's untapped imagination: a family descended from ravens, the characterization of Gussie's father as an untamed and vain northern spirit. Insightful look at mother-child relationships reflects theme of struggle for independence and pursuit of individual path. The novel also takes an interesting look at male/female stereotypes--what it would have been like to be a strong, resourceful, fiercely independent child-woman, but to be trapped in the very limited, ""man's world"" of the early West."
4,An excellent reader.,"I like Delkin products for their quality and this reader is no exception. I am a novice photographer and recently entered into digital photography. I also program computers. So I needed a device which I could use for both. On the weekends I can use the reader for transfering photos. During the week I use it to store and move data from PC to PC. The transfer rate is OK, the only item I wish it had was a parallel port adapter. I would highly recommend this reader."
3,what a debut,while this is no abigail this is the begining of a amazing career. even king bad cds are good albums overall. this is not a story album but songs like dressed in white and halloween cannot be denied along with the rest of this. it only gets 3 stars because i hold kings stuff on a pedistal but like i said before even his worst album is a good album overall. plus on the remaster you get the amazing songs the lake and no presents for christmas. so get this and see what metal really is.
2,Not for everyone.,"Although I thought the guitar riffs and melodies were very creative and very catchy, I found King Diamond's high-pitched screeching was headache-inducing. This ruined the listening experience. Those who don't like high-pitched vocals and those who are prone to migraines probably shouldn't buy this."
5,Amazing first King Diamond album !...,"This album was to be the thirth Mercyful Fate album, but (unfortunately) they broke up during 1985. Michael Denner plays at its best, as well as Andy La Roque. The album has a fantastic atmosphere, all seems perfect ! ...including the artwork ! A must for all true Diamond fans !!!!!!"
4,Goenkeji's fireside chats,"The material in this book is not as personal and revealing as in the videos presented in the 10-day Vipassana meditation workshop (I've attended 5 10-day events as of Jan 2007); however, if you are looking to study and get clear on the 8 pathways, the 3 kinds of Panya, etc., this book will give you what you need to outline and organize the ideas logically. This book is NOT as good as being there. The Vipassana experience has given me the tools to assist me in mentally solidifying my walk on the path."
3,It Really Is The Discourse Summaries,"I was a little dissapointed to find out that this book really is just a repeat of everything he says in the discourses at the 10-day course. Somehow I guess I was thinking it'd be different. If you've done the course, you've heard this all before. If you haven't done the course - don't read this book! Go take a course!Goenka rocks, this book you could skip. Check out the other collections of his writing for more stuff that will compliment the course rather than repeat it.(Or, if you want, simply keep this as a reference to remember what the discourses say)"
3,Vipassana retreat lectures,"Goenka is very powerful. His words drip luminosity. If this is your calling, go for it. Just beware: Every leader has some charisma. Find a teacher that is ordinary. Find your inspiration from within."
1,the preaching is contradicted by reality,"I really enjoyed Goenka humor and preaching watching a video of one discourse every night during the 10 days course I took this summer in Kyoto. However, when I wanted to take a second one, I was told that hypnotherapists as well as people practicing any other form of meditation were forbidden to take more than one course. Now if this is not prejudice and intolerance what is it? Isn't it in complete contradiction with the love and peace for all preached in a trance state by Goenka? Having read more since, I also realized that this is a very simplified and hypnotic form of Vipassana meditation for lay men and not at all the real thing advocated by the Buddha. This is simply a cult built around a prejudiced guru, a master hypnotist with his stories and beautiful chanting."
5,Turkey liting forks,"These are great forks to use, not just for Turkeys, but other large meat items you cook. I have used them to just hold the meat in place when I cut as well. Many uses for them and not just for Turkeys. Well worth the price and use."
4,Easy lifting,"If you roast 20+ lb. turkeys, these lifters are indispensable. If the handles would have been slightly longer, they would have merited a 5 star review."
4,Very Sturdy,"Was a gift along with a turkey roaster. Every Thanksgiving we hunt for tools to remove the turkey from the roasting pan, these should fit the bill for many years to come."
5,Great product,"I bought these for my mom for Chirstmas, she usually hates kitchen items, and takes offence to me or day buying them, but she was over joyed when she used them on the Christmas ham the same day she got unwrapped them. She has lupis and arthiritis and said that the lifters helped her manouver the ham, and she didnt experience any hand or wrist pain."
5,great!,I got these a year ago for a gift and love them. They're very sturdy. I used them on lots of chickens and even a 20 pound turkey. I'm buying them for a friend now.
4,"A brief, informative piece on old Tibet","Heinrich Harrer gives a personal view of Tibet as it was before Chinese occupation by the Reds in 1959, and shows with an unmistakable wit his love for the country and its people. He emphasizes the hospitality of the Tibetan people, and, at the same time, their wish to be a ""forbidden land,"" a country that wants no foreigners. Harrer's recollection of his journey from India to the Tibetan frontier, to Lhasa is splendidly described, and mildly illustrates the harshness of the Himalayas and its climate. Harrer also tells of his relationship with the present Dalai Lama, who was at the time of Harrer's residence in Tibet only a boy. Harrer's thought's on Tibetan Buddhism, and how superstitious the Tibetans are, is written in an overt, yet skeptical style. A grand read!"
3,Great story but a bad job of translation and editing.,This is a wonderful story and peaks the interest of the reader to know more about Tibet and Tibetans but the translation from German to English is crude and the editing is poor.
3,Well!!,"There are some astonishing parallels between the story of an English governess in Thailand, ""The King and I"" and this story of a blond Teuton with dubious political leanings in 1940s Tibet. Both centralise their roles in the lives of a monarchic figure, each then a very much romanticised icon of forbidden or far-away lands. In both cases there is good evidence that this delicious intimacy was in fact limited to a few distant audiences with the figure in question. In the latter case, the Dalai Lama's own writings bear just a few, absent minded references to this much vaunted friendship, if at all and older hands at the Tibetan capital-in-exile Dharamsala in Northern India will smile ryely at any mention of Harrer. Nevertheless, as a work of semi-fiction, the book carries considerable merit but as a an accurate travel account, has to be undressed in layers before it becomes palatable."
3,Sad propaganda,"It's sad to see this book, written by a personal friend of the Dalai Lama's, used by the Tibetans as their propaganda. For a more objective understanding of the atrocities in Tibet, I would highly recommend The Making of Modern Tibet, by A. Tom Grunfeld, a professor of history at Empire State College of the State University of New York. Dr. Grunfeld's book details the terrible treatment the serfs in Tibet used to receive from their lords, and the political intrigues of the both the Dalai Lama's and the communist party's tactics."
3,Regarding the sound recording,A note on the sound recording by books on tape: The reading is fine EXCEPT that reader has such a heavy British accent you keep forgetting that Harrer was Austrian. It's disconcerting listening to this English voice talk about trying to escape from the English in India and his suspicions about the British legation in Lhasa. I wish they'd found someone else to read the book.
5,Excellent history,Excellent history showing mysterious Tibet and transformation of a rather accidental visitor to that country into a different person. Fantastic story and written in an excellent way. A real masterpiece.
5,Tibet before the invasion,"Seven Years in Tibet is the story of Heinrich Harrer's time in Tibet in the 1940-50's. Harrer was a member of a German climbing team who were in the Himalayas at the start of world war 2 and as a result was interned by the British in India. In 1943 Harrer with three other Germans successfully escaped from this internment camp a fled to neutral Tibet. After many adventures and missteps Harrer and one of his colleagues succeed in traveling to the capital of Lhasa where he is accepted in Tibetan society serving a variety of roles within the government and finally as the tutor to the young Dali Lama.Harrer in his narrative portraits a fascinating picture of Tibet in the 1940's, a picture of a ancient and tradition bound society struggling with the intrusion of the outside world and modernity while seeking to retain its unique way of life and government."
5,An useful guide for travellers,"I decided to read the book when I started thinking about travelling to Tibet (and after gaining a book of Dalai Lama). I was really surprised with the amount of useful information about Tibet: its people, its culture; its traditions; its politics and so on. So, I strongly recommend it to everybody that is interested in knowing better the tibetan culture and way of thinking and being. And to those who are planning to visit Tibet or, who knows, are interested in the tragic story of these people."
5,An immersive book with a sense of adventure.,The fact that the story actually happened is quite extraordinary. The book details the lives of two climbers who were imprisoned and escaped to Tibet. Their ordeal is extraordinary fought with xenophobia and a strange culture.The journey itself has a sense of adventure and hope. Once the travellers find themselves in the city the pace changes. The story deals with the underlying cultural differences and the changes in tibet. This book is a must read for those interested in different cultures as well as for the armchair Indiana Jones.
4,Seven Years In Tibet,"While Heinrich Harrer admits from the start that he is no great writer, (and I agree with him), the story itself is so compelling and the union of his star with the historical movements in Tibet so well alligned that the man can be forgiven for just being there and letting us share in the experience. The simplicity of his words is in keeping with the innocence of Tibet and its people. They are hand and glove and there is no better fit then when, toward the end of the book, he tutors His Holiness, and brings us directly into contact with the living Buddha. It is no less a moving experience for all of us. The torturous trip from India into Tibet and finally into the holy city of Lahsa, the majestic beauty of the Himalayas, the simple faith of the people all combine to make this a worthwhile experience. It is a wake up call for all people of faith and love. Thank you Heinrich."
2,Listen to The Eye or Abigail Instead.,"Ever since I bought Them and heard it in its entirety a few years ago I've been disappointed. I just recently gave it a listen and my opinion of it is still the same. I get the impression that this release was put together and released too quickly or something; the songs just aren't very interesting. Of course I'm not slighting the musicianship. The musicianship is good, it just doesn't matter though when the songs aren't standouts. I think that Abigail and The Eye are good albums, but Them has always been a far cry from those two albums. The album is a bit silly in places also. Try one of his other albums: preferable The Eye or Abigail--those are pretty good albums. Them isn't completely poor, but I think that it could've been better."
3,Not as silly as it looks.,"I always thought King was some silly gimmick until I listened to him. Even though the stories can be border line silly, this is good music. The vocals are awesome, but I dont like the mix, if only they put more presence in the guitar this album might get four stars."
4,"BETTER THAN ""ABIGAIL"", BUT...","This third album by King DIamond, released in 1988, is better than ""ABIGAIL"", but has one problem: Michael Denner and bassist Timi Hansen are not in the band anymore, and it is clear that their replacements, guitarrist Pete Blakk and bassist Hal Patino, were not in the same league.Anyway, the quality of the compositions overshadow its failures and the album is fantastic."
4,"One of King's best, second only to Abigail","This, too, is another stunning masterpiece from King. Here you learn all about the demons that own and haunt the house of Amon, released through a ritualistic tea party by King's evil grandmother. It's another horrific tale sung in choral hymns that only King could deliver. My only problem with this disc is lack of bass, it's too drowned back into the mix, and the drums aren't prominent either. Otherwise, this one will chill your spine as much or more than Abigail."
4,One of King's best albums!,"This album is one of King's best. If you like progressive metal and horror flick-inspired lyrics you need to buy this album. The music on this CD draws heavily from the classical genre, but the music is totally heavy metal (the guitar solos are sublime). King wrote ""Them"" as a concept album; each song is linked to the other to tell a horrific tale. The story begins with grandma coming home from the asylum (that is when the fun starts!). Soon all manner of supernatural chaos ensues as grandma resurrects the spirits of ""them"" for her evening tea party. A must have for the complete metal library."
5,'THEM' is one of the best metal albums out there!,"I love this album! it is the best king diamond album by far.the story line is just so good and the playing is so tight and well rehearsed.this is the man and the album that got me into metal.if your looking for some damn good music,buy this!....and also,check out king's other albums like,abigail,the graveyard and best of."
5,BEST HEAVY METAL ALBUM EVER?,"Long before Marilyn Manson decided to start copying superior metal acts like King Diamond and Alice Cooper, this album was terrorizing us. There simply isn't a better metal album to be found in my opinion. The songs are creepy and the lead guitar-work is the best this side of Blizzard of Oz. If you're new to King Diamond, ""Them"" or ""Conspiracy"" are great places to start. His newer albums like ""Voodoo"" and ""Spider's Lullabye"" can't even come close to this masterpiece. ""Twilight Symphony"" and ""Welcome Home"" are as good as it gets."
5,Great quality,"The product has great quality, also the instructions where easy to follow, it is a good product, and the value is the correct."
1,Kindle edition map images - Very poor quality!,"I just bought this for Kindle iPad and was very disappointed of image quality on city maps. They're completely unusable, blurred to utter confusion when zooming up close and obviously very low res.Otherwise it seems like a good Rough Planet guide but having to carry separate maps with you kind of defeats the whole purpose of having this guide on a tablet. I won't be buying another guide until I see this feature fixed and recommend to stay away from Kindle edition, at least on iPad.I sure hope a quick and free update for this!"
5,Nice Guide,This is a useful travel guide that is intuitive in the way it is laid out and formated. It gives a nice overview to each of the different regions then drills down to the interesting towns and sights.Added bonus is a short section on Portuguese history and even a nice list of other books for continued reading. Obrigado!
3,OK but...,I purchased the Rough Guide to Portugal for information on Madeira and Porto Santo. There is no information included for these two islands off Portugal. The rest of the guide looks useful but I found it disappointing to not include a section on the islands in the Rough Guide as the Rough Guide Madeira & Porto Santo looks to not be made anymore.
5,Makes great flavored sweet tea,I add two of these to my normal sweet tea brew and I just love the taste. People are always talking about how good it tastes. Its also great alone! Its great! A must try!
4,Good book for learning/practicing repairs,"I've bought this book and find it useful for learning and practicing repair techniques. It's a bit involved for the new watchmaker, but once you're past the disaasembly,cleaning, oiling,and reassembly stage; It will come in handy."
5,Richly textured and Easily Enjoyed,"This book is like any good Icon ... in its own way it is a richly textured work with multiple layers of meaning, insight, and prayerfulness ... but with great attention paid by Powers to creating an aesthetically pleasing and beautiful work. Powers' ability to weave multiple story lines, easy philosophical inquiry, and mystery create a work that is intriguing and that pulls the reader through each level in a pleasing, peaceful, edifying way. By Icon's end, one will recognize that Powers has facilitated the reader's personal encounter with the divine."
4,"Spectacular, Spectacular","Sandra Cisneros has out done herself! What a spectacular book that practically anyone can read. With stories to keep your eyes glued to the book and your mind asking for more. What I thought was best about this book was that I felt as if it has many stories in one novel. With her gift to give her readers that ""want to read"" need. I may not be the person who reads novel after novel but I can really say that i enjoyed reading this book. Even though it was a book assignment to be read on my winter break I am happy to say that it was a great way to spend my free time. Reading this book kept me satified and enetertained. I may not be a real critic but I can give my opinion on what I think a great book is and this is a great book. I have had the privledge to read her other books and poems and think every time she only gets beter and better. I cannot wait till I can get my hands on her next book!!!"
3,Just read House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende,"This book did an excellent job of documenting the stories of a large colorful family in refreshingly realistic and blunt way, but I gave it 3 stars because it was also somewhat erratic and boring. Cisnero's efforts to make the book entertaining and intricate at once felt like she was forcing the ""rebozo"" metaphor. Continual attempts to appeal to the senses prove to be more vulgar and overwhelming than ""poetic"". The comedic element of the book is good but would fare better if the characters were more 3-dimensional and endearing. The bits about Mexican History were fascinating and added texture to the book."
2,Ugh!,"I couldn't wait for this story to be over. I listened to the audio book and I must admit that Cisneros is a fabulous reader - her voice and inflections and reading ability was fantastic. But the story literally bored me. I can't believe I listened to all 14 hours. Granted her ""poetic"" writing, with the descriptions and the lists, was interesting... for about the first half hour. After that it was trivial and started to sound like the author was just trying to fill pages. And when she started reading personals from a newspaper written by folks not involved in the story - for about 20 minutes!! - I thought I was going to die. I never got involved with the characters and honestly could have cared less about their lives.So two stars for the first class reading ability. The story alone would have gotten one star."
1,stereotype after stereotype,"Poorly written and without a point, this is an endless barrage of stereotypes. I'm a Chicana, and I don't know why I'm supposed to believe any of this. It reads like a bad tourist vision of Mexico, of Chicanos whose life is just one cheap joke after another. Why are people taking this seriously? The best thing about this book is the cover, but Rosa Covarrubias must be turning in her grave, to be turned into the poster girl for the silly glorification of rebozos and tamales."
2,Caramelo,I listened to this book on tape and found it to be the most irritating book I've ever tried to listen to. I couldn't finish it. the voices were so distracting I couldn't get the actual story being read. Good luck to anyone else trying to get through it.
2,Still stuck...,"I was so excited for this book and for Ms. Cisneros. I was first in line to purchase it. However, when I looked through it, I was disappointed by the fractured, child-like chapters. Those would have been acceptable some of the time, but not so consistently! They were like small portions when i wanted a serious burrito. The longer chapters did, however, capture a narrative, but they were akin to the uninterrupted, smooth motor sounds from an otherwise busted up brand-new used Cadillac. There were parts that were moving. There were parts that were annoying (the footnotes, in particular, felt condescending). Overall, I suggest that Ms. Cisneros abandon self-conscious writing and leave that to the wack mid-30s gringos who don't have a rich narrative. Stick to a true, connected plot (that doesn't mean you have to be serious) and ditch the jazzy fonts, and you won't stay stuck for long."
4,"Spectacular, Spectacular","Sandra Cineros has outdone herself. After waiting for this novel I have to say I was not disappointed at all. Her words kept me wanting to read page after page until there were no pages left to read. Her book reveals a story about a girl that seems like a spanish soap opera with ups and downs,tragedies, heart break, reconciliation, hate, love, laughter, and tears. Even though this book was read as an assignment I feel as though it was destiny for me to read. I am now even more interseted in poems by Sandra Cisneros. I have read House on Mango Street but after reading Caramelo I am a huge fan of Sandra Cisneros and can really relate to her stories and poems. Cisneros has a gift and is able to share that gift to the world by her words that create this wonderful story that anyone can enjoy."
4,Enchanting,"Cisneros captures (most) Mexican and in general Latino families perfectly. Yes she does use some sterotypes but in my opinion they are sterotypes that many times are true and I do not feel that they are all necessarily shameful. I'm mexican American, and I'm not trying to speak for the entire community in any way. I felt she gave the reader a deep understanding of this rich culture even the importance of the reboza does not seem that important but when I thought back to my visits to Mexico I just remembered that many if not most women even from different classes wore a rebozo so it can be seen as an important aspect of many Mexican women's lives. I enjoy Caramelo because of it's honesty and her desire as she says in the novel to simply tell a story."
1,Am I missing something?,"I have read all the glowing reviews for this book and I wonder what I'm missing. I couldn't even finish this book. It was so fragmented - just wanted to read a good story! This book was the Today show pick for the month and I thought it would be a good read, but I really did not like it at all. I am an avid reader but this book left me cold."
4,entretenido,Esta es una novela de ficcion con muchos detalles de informacion historicamuy entretenido y divertido
4,Poetic Lines,"I started a reading binge with Caramelo. Cisneros is famed for her young people's book, Casa on Mango Street, and she definitely takes the adult plunge with this hefty book.I wanted so much to love Caramelo. I can't say I didn't like it, but it was hard to get through. If Gilb builds poetry into his stories, Cisneros' talent is poetic lines that every few pages make you start to hunt for them. It helped me turn the pages. This is a novel I think that her many fans would love."
1,Not a very good book,I loved House on Mango Street but I couldn't even make myself finish this book. Too many characters and too much spanish splashed into the novel for me personnelly to be able to complete it. House on Mango was so great and this is so drab - amazing the difference in the two.
4,Happily surprised,"I've never read a book about Mexico or the Mexican culture until this book. I was happily surprised. At first I thought, uh-oh, this is going to go by slowly, there's Spanish in here (which I don't speak or read)...but after about 50 pages, I was hooked.I enjoyed how at the end of each chapter there were footnotes describing in detail something or another that was in the chapter. For instance the government at the time or something going on in popular culture.What I enjoyed the most was the stories about the grandma and mother. I felt this was really a good book. I only give it a 4 because it drag in some points, but most of the time the pages flew by."
5,beautiful!,This is one of the most beautiful books I have read in a long time. It is all about family and weaving together and clashing of two cultures. You will love it.
5,What a REFERENCE!!,"This is a FANTASTIC Reference on Candlesticks. It is informative, giving background information on the companies and their years of operation, showing highly detailed photographs of various candlesticks made by each company, and explaining the differences in lookalikes. There are over 230 pictures of Fostoria candlesticks and over 185 of Heisey, two of the most prolific of the 19 companies represented in the book. I especially like the PHOTO INDEX of all pictures in the book, making identification of unknown pieces a breeze. This 3-book reference series is well worth the money for any glass collector or dealer!"
3,"Okay, but not Pelton's best","As a huge fan of Robert Young Pelton's World's Most Dangerous Places, I was really looking forward to reading this book. But while it was entertaining enough, I didn't feel that it was up to DP's usual standards...so I found myself being mildly disappointed.I guess that when it comes down to it, I felt that the book was not meaty enough for a Pelton offering. The chapters were fairly short and I don't really feel that enough specifics were given about any given survival situation for the book to be truly useful in the field. Often, I felt like I was being given the ""executive summary"" rather than the specific details I would need to stay alive under trying circumstances.Because I'm a DP fan, I know that Pelton can do better than this. This book won't stop me from reading other Pelton offerings, but I'm hoping that, like DP itself, it will evolve year by year and edition by edition into a truly excellent book."
1,Worse than worthless,"I would hope that a book with this title would at least have its facts straight, but with even my limited knowledge, I found errors in almost every chapter. Where were the editors and fact-checkers?? Some of the errors are just silly: ""water weighs about sixty pounds a square foot"" (!). Some of them are confusing: one tablet of Potable-Aqua ""should disinfect about 16 liters of murky water"" (the label calls for 2 tablets per quart!). It's not correct that 7.5-minute topos always have 20-foot contour lines (in fact, it varies, depending on local terrain). The advice on overheating is potentially life-threatening, since it doesn't give the simple and clear diagnostics that you'll find in any first-aid manual between heat prostration (pale and clammy... rest and drink fluids) and heatstroke (red and hot... call an ambulance, rather than fanning yourself, as the author recommends!). Get a copy of the Boy Scout Handbook instead of this book."
2,Use common sense,"This book is long on humorous one liners and short on specifics. The amount of useful, hard, practical info could be put into a small pamphlet. It was a fairly enjoyable light read (I used it as a bathroom reader, sorry Robert) but I have in the past and plan in the future to travel to some of these places he mentions and I feel no better prepared for them. Perhaps it is good he does not instill a false sence of security in people by giving them clever 1,2,3 recipies for difficult situations. The one theme found throughout the book is ""use your common sense."" This is good advice, but then, I already knew that."
1,Don't waste your time,I picked up this book at a used book store for $5 and am still kicking myself for even paying that much for it. Short chapters that are heavy on humor and very light on anything useful. The advice in the self-defense section reads like it was written by someone with about six months of training in a storefront martial arts school who read a bunch of books by others who promote these shoddy types of techniques. Don't waste your time.
1,An exploitive capitalization on people's fears.,"Capitalizing on America's ""culture of fear"", this book is about as realistic as a Stephen King novel. It's not much more useful either. The only purpose I can imagine for this book is a reaffirmation for *not traveling* for someone who wasn't going to travel anyway. Also a great book for anyone who loves exploitative and nonsensical television shows like ""How to Survive"" and ""When Animals Attack"". Oh well, fools like that keep the rest of the world relatively uncrowded for those of us who actually do enjoy traveling."
1,Do Not Buy These Notebooks,I work in a science lab and a new admin bought these instead of our normal National Brand notebooks. The TOPS notebooks are awful. The pages started falling out from the first moment we opened the notebooks. Don't bother with these notebooks.
5,thumbs up,i participated in making the cd and i hope that evryone can enjoy it as much as i do. it was for a good cause and i hope that everyone can appreciate its worth.
1,Do not buy this product!,"I just ordered and received this MP4/MP3 player. I have attempted to read the ""manual"" which came with it but it was of no help. The CD which comes with the unit has two trojan horse viruses on it so unless you want to install those on your computer the software is of no use.In trying to find a website for the manufacturer, Wilson Co. Ltd. there is no support or available firmware upgrades available.I suggest paying more and buying a unit with support and documentation."
4,My New Gadget!,I really like this product! It was pretty easy to get the songs and pictures on there and I listened to it for hours on the first day and still didn't have to charge it! It took a minute or two to get used to the functions but I got the hang of it pretty quick. I don't recommend this product to the people who aren't computer savvy because it takes a little bit of previous knowledge to figure out how to use it. This is a really great product for me and I hope everyone else who gets this has a good experience with it as well.
1,how to use it?,"Hi,I just bought this product, but there's no useful instruction which can tell me how to use it. There's no web address, even no production's name,manufacturer's any information.Is there a tiem requirement for the first charging?Can anyone help me? thanks!"
3,A Disappointing Product of Modernist Apologetics,"A disappointing example of modernist apologetics, Trueblood attempts to outline a philosophy of religion based on a largely outdated model of logical proofs which can only (a la Derrida) set itself up to be deconstructed. Trueblood often over-generalizes (it's obvious that everyone has an objective experience of possession by art, for example), and his insistence on the necessity of a transcendent objectivity to make sense of life is stated as a fact without any supporting argument. Trueblood also shows a puzzling igorance of the role of cultural formation and transmission of morals, aesthetics, and ethics. Although he does provide an excellent critique of scientific reductionism and a helpful summary of Marxism, the volume feels dated after cultural criticism. Better find a newer and less 1950s bound summary, unless you're wanting an example of the thinking of that particular time."
2,"Appealing, but misses the mark","I really like the idea of this book. Unfortunately, the illustration of the authors' ideas does not work for me. It seemed that they were trying to attach too much emotional energy to a sub-modality which could then simply be re-arranged in one's mind and presto! everything was cured. In a lot of ways the book ended up trying to be a quick-fix. This method might work with getting children to overcome their fears, but I think adults are a little more complicated. It's a nice beginning but the too-nice ending gives the book a 'slimey' feel. Either that or very new-age. Hocus-pocus. Just follow these instructions and out come blueberry muffins! If life were that easy, it would be a very cliche and boring place."
1,Disappointing,"A small book that covers a subset of the material in ""Using your Brain for a Change"", plus the Swish Pattern. There are a few short transcripts of Bandler, but otherwise the book is in the words of Will MacDonald. I found it too superficial to be of any use. The same material has been covered much more effectively in other books."
3,DECENT CAMERA BUT DOESN'T ALWAYS FOCUS PROPERLY,We received this camera as a Christmas gift and I loved it at first. However as I started using it more I noticed that i doesn't always focus properly. It is usually when you are taking pictures of brighter colors and also when there isn't a lot of lighting. I wouldn't say this is a bad camera but their are certainly better models out there.
4,hp has impressed me,"My main digi cam is a Panasonic FZ20 which is alot bigger then this hp, so I wanted something that I could carry easily with me and stil provide quality pics. Well, along came the m627 and I am very pleased and happy with it. I was hesitante being that it is a hp digi cam, but I read on it and said what the heck. (It was only 50 or less that I paid for it, cant recall) I love the large lcd, very easy and simple to use which is what I want in a small portable cam. takes great pics, which I was surprised about. the only draw back, it only has 3x optical zoom but thats why I have the FZ20 with 12x optical.one thing though, not all HP cams will be as good as this one or better then this one. I was looking to buying a hp one for my mom for mothers day, a newer model but the pics the demo model was taking were CRAP compared to this model.so, def read and try to get your hands on it before making a purchase."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought the sandisk floppy disk adaptor for my smartmedia and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it can transfer large-ish files between computers. Then I found out it uses expensive batteries ... and eats them up quickly - and, much worse, it only works on smartmedia cards up to 32 megs. Very disappointed."
4,I was sucked in...,"I was sucked in my the first line of the review, ""A man goes on a journey... plague-ridden rabbit"" and I just had to read this book. I love odd fiction, and I was not disappointed. As with all humans, the characters were flawed but I felt compassion and understanding for the decisions they made and their consequences, as none of it could have come about with the most extreme of circumstances, which these people certainly were facing. There was nothing predictable about the book, so I was interested to the very end. I recommend it to anyone looking for fiction that's really ""different"" to read."
2,Disappointing mix of cheesy trance,"Most tracks on this CD are what I would call commercial cheesy dance music. The best example of how cheesy it gets is perhaps the Scotland the Brave mix. If you are looking for a decent trance compilation with easy-to-listen-to-yet-catchy tracks, have a look at Deep Trance Vol.1..."
4,"Worth hunting for, amazing live show from el macambo 78","This CD was put out in 1993 as part of a 3 CD set on Demon Records along with extended CDs of This Years Model and My AIm Is True, set list is Mystery Dance, Waiting for the end of the world, welcome to the working week, less than zero, the beat, lip service, chelsea, litter triggers, radio radio, lipstick vogue (killer), watching the detectives, miracle man, you belong to me (great) and pump it up. Every EC fans needs this."
3,Needs A Different Title,"If your interests lie in the area of military battles and the people that fought in them then this will be a good source of information for you. However, the title should've been ""The Battle For Hitler's U-Boat Fortesses"". The title mislead me into thinking that this was about the U-Boat pens themselves. I was fully expecting information on the design, logistics, service records, and daily life that would be associated with these structures. I would not have purchased this book had I known the contents."
4,peanut butter's my favorite,"I bought the double box of these and my desire to eat them increased as I went through the box. I quite like the bars now, but I probably would have scored it only 2 stars for the first one I ate. I kept them in the fridge and they made a perfect breakfast or snack before the gym or if I didn't want to sit down to a ""real"" meal. I like the fact that they are chewy and not too sweet and I feel like I ate something substantial when I am done."
1,Caution --,"These are easily the worst tasting energy bars I've ever tried. I seriously urge that you avoid wasting money on bulk purchase until you have tried a single bar from a store.There are many good tasting energy bars out there, and this one sure isn't among them."
4,It is a good book,It is a good book.It is always difficult to learn an active game like tennis through a book. But I have to say I an very glad I purchased this book. It is a good book to read while you are not on the court.Good book
2,Bad instructional book,"This book maybe contains some useful information, but not for me. I would never recommend it as an instructional book.Some parts are totally misleading for the beginners. Chapter about the serve especially disappointing - there is no sense to waist time to teach a serve like this. After reading this book I started immediately to look for other instructional material."
3,not really,"if you're a beginner, then yes, you can play better in 2hrs. otherwise, there's nothing really new. there might be some slight techniques that are different than traditional methods, but all the new kids are playing with variations of the wegner method, so don't really need this book. just play. two weeks of reading and only some new techniques. oh well."
5,Very Cute Book,This is a wonderful book for a beginner reader. My child frist picked it up at her school library and we just had to get a copy for home
3,a good live cd,though the song selection for this cd had me scratching my head it was the only live diamond cd to that point so you take what you can get. the liner note from diamond about finding the tapes in his dark wet basement with spiders etc is hillarious as im sure the tapes would sound this good after being in a wet basement for years. i have the original and the remaster. you dont get any bonus tracks on the remaster and the fold out poster is gone. i gave away all my originals when the remasters hit the shelves but kept this for the poster inside. but the sound is raw and i respect the fact they released it how it was with no overdubs. if you love the king get this
5,King LIVE(S),A very good CD with recordings from the Abigail tour. It has one Mercyful Fate's song too.
2,"""I must take what is rightfully mine........""","Recorded during the '87 tour ""Abigail"", this release leaves something to be desired for. It's not terrible, it's not bad, but I expected a little better than this. I've seen the King live, these recordings do not do the band or the King justice. The band sounds pretty good, but the way King's vocals were recorded makes you just want to go back and listen to the albums! I've heard better bootlegs than this, and the Mercyful Fate mini-disc ""The Bell Witch"" was also better. For Die-Hard King Diamond nuts only."
3,Ordinary book,"I am a fellow of Nephrology at University of Vermont.I have used this book occasionly , due to the reason as it is a bit bulky to carry in white coat.I wish it was more portable.Secondly main reason I say its ordinary book because the information is not very updated and the science of therapeutics is changing.It does not talk in detail about high flux dialyzer clearence of drugs.I will recommend it to my fellow colleagues in Nephrology to use but not to rely solely on it.Tariq Rehman MDFellow in NephrologyUniversity of VermontBurlington VT"
4,Survival Source,After completing a residency in internal medicine/pediatrics and using many other sources to decide on renal drug dosing I have been most delighted with the introduction to this one at the beginning of my nephrology fellowship. The very rapid accessible concise format of key essentials I need for patients with temporary or chronic renal failure are also adjusted for types of renal replacement therapy. Only suggestion I have is: please update with new addition and more meds included as soon as possible. Wish I had known about this book from the first day of my internship.
4,videophile,"Love the product. Very surprise that the company did not mass produce this product. This product could have replaced the VCR.I have not tried the latest DVD-Recorder. Since the CDRW price is so low relatively to the DVD disc, this product is a great alternative. I use it for mostly storing vacation videocam from the VHS-C to the disc (great storage of memories). Again, great product."
2,terapin TX-0002 -- trouble using non-terapin CD-R,"I have owned one of these things since 2004. It works fine if you use ""terapin brand"" CD-R's. I have not found an alternate brand that the machine will recognize, so I use the one terapin brand CD-RW that came with the machine. If I lose that CD-RW the machine is useless. I would not recommend its purchase."
4,Very nice...,"It looks great, CGI is amazing, I was hooked from minute one. Also it sounds great, great music that goes with the action very well.There is just one drawback, too short. There is just not enought time to make and feel the story deeper, so the makers took the easy way out and simplified it. For an anime series of this caliber a simple plot doesn't fit, it just doesn't. Maybe they should have made it 13 episodes or something."
4,"Above average, but not quite top notch.","This anime has very good visuals (both CGI and traditional styles are used.)All of the fight scenes are amazing, and the robotic demons do not necessarily disappoint(I would have preferred to have seen humanoid demons rather than robotic ones.)The only real issue that I had with this anime was the lack of a good ending and a bit of confusion about what exactly the point of the story is at times. Still, I recommend this to any anime fan."
2,The art is great but......... -Jult Warfell,"If you have time to kill............ you can watch this and realize the story is boring, I know I know could I be more vague. The answer is yes. Jult Warfell"
5,Amazing,"This is a great pair of films. Great story, fast paced action, blow the **** out of your mind animation. A must have or any fan of the genre."
3,Hot animation Hard to follow,"Like many anime movies, this was a series packed into a two parter. Too many charactors with not enough development. It had awsome action and grafic detail though."
2,Shiny but hollow,"Undeniably beautiful, the artistry cannot be faulted. These are visually stunning movies with exquisitely (and sometimes grotesquely) rendered images. However, as dazzling as the artwork is, the story leaves much to be desired. At all times purposely obscure, it is more than just a little difficult to follow. What begins as simply bewildering soon becomes annoying, a mindless tease for reasons unknown. What made this even worse was when the story was finally revealed it was so simplistic in nature that a mere sentence could sum it up: making this much ado about absolutely nothing. This is storytelling at its worse; barely above mindless rambling.The story: in a city where demons are forgotten by humans, a battle ensues to teach the humans a lesson and to bring an oppressor to power over all. Yeah, that's pretty much it, good against evil. No surprise who wins.Top marks for looks, zero for being incomprehensible. Won't put myself through another sitting, not a keeper."
1,KARAS- THE COMPLETE COLLECTION,MY FAMILY LOVES ANIME BUT THIS WE CAN SAY WAS A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE GAVE IT AWAY- THAT SHOULD SAY IT ALL!
4,A 40 year old film that stands the test of time.,"It could have been made yesterday. You wouldn't say it was made in 1971. The image is very good, and once you start you can't stop watching it up to the end. I would remark the performances of the actors, some interesting topics that emerge from the story and the direction by Robert Aldrich."
5,Amazing !!!,"Never saw such an accurate depiction of my personality on a deep level. The Enneagram is very accurate and very specific, far more revealing than any otherpsych test I have taken to date ( MMPI, MBTI, etc). This would be an amazing toolfor professionals to get too use as they could not only relate more effectively to their patients, but they could teach their patients to relate better to others.Highly Recommended"
5,Live this book! Don't just shelve it!,"A friend lent it to me. I don't usually buy these kinds of books. However.... I found this book profoundly insightful. I found it reassuring. It helped me to acknowledge, accept and forgive myself, and to then face uncomfortable truths. It provided aspiration in the vision of an 'integrated' self, and a good warning system in the vision of a 'disintegrated' self. It did this in a way that was rich and complex, without hanging onto the type labels too much. This is not a quick fix book. It lead me to the insight that in order to be happy with oneself, and to cultivate true wisdom, one has to be able to relate to all your own mental ages and personalities. It's this that helps us understand those around us. It's a great book to help start, or to refresh one's spiritual/personal journey. But for it to work, you have to be willing to LIVE it, not just add it to your collection of self-help books."
5,Personality Types helped me to understand people,This revised edition provides the most valuable info I have ever seen in any enneagram book. It showed where I am at and where I can potentially be. I particularly like how it strikes a balance between the good and the bad traits. They avoid nasty descriptive terms to describe each of the 9 personality types. My father's biotech company uses this book to improve productivity. It's also helped our family members to better understand one another. It has given me the ability to have a greater understanding of myself and those around me.
4,A Mental Labyrinthe,"It all started with a side colomn in a Thai newspaper on one of those culture shoking travel trips and I found myself buying every book on the subject. This was my first read and it sure drew the Enneagram maze in my mind, I found it extremely useful and very exhausting, it's the kind of book that you want to consume quickly yet you're overwhelmed with the depth of Enneagram. Read it, and buy more books, you're barely scratching the surface."
1,Don't buy this book unless you like grief in you life.,"This book apparently explains different types of personalities according to the ""Enneagram"" which basically is a nine point division of human personality traits. The problem I found was that nearly every group had similiarities causing confusion and grief to the reader. I couldn't even find my own personality catagory, it seemed like every division has traits that everybody displays. I'm sure proponents of the book will tell one to look at the ""general personality type"" but this was no use for me. This is the only book I ever returned here."
2,Negativity doesn't help.,"I think the ""growing pains"" the previous reviewer spoke about are really overdone in this book. As Riso describes the nine levels of health within each type, he starts with the healthiest and progresses downward, introducing more and more negative points. It is more than ""pains;"" it is discouraging. He should've done it the other way 'round, feeding us more and more positive things in order to create inspiration. I gave it an extra star because despite the sense of hopelessness it engenders, the book is very descriptive."
3,Close but no cigar.,"Its worth reading if you are at all interested in the Italian tradition, but beware that it is mostly just guess work and wishfull thinking. The author fails to present any kind of evidence to support this information and attempts to fool the reader into thinking just the opposite. Yes, this is yet another misleading Llewellyn ""rag"" that tries to re-write history, but in this case the author is on to something. There obviously was just such a tradition in the ""old Country"" but the focus here is whether Aradia was ever mentioned before Leland published her accounts. No one has been able to support this. However, what little information the author does authenticate makes the book worth owning. What I disliked the most is the classic ""Llewellyn Writer"" tendancy to promote statements as historical ""truth"", when they are really just stretching the truth in order to support their theories. Worth reading with a bit of scepticism."
3,Not what I had hoped for...,"I was so excited to discover this DVD, and I had high hopes that it would be of good quality. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this DVD. While it's great to hear Duke jamming with Ray Brown, the camera work is gut-wrenchingly terrible, and most of the time Norman Granz is standing in front of the camera. Seriously. The other disc features some goofy camera work as well as some good performances; Ella is wonderful as always, but she and Duke aren't actually performing together (Jimmy Jones is at the piano). If you're looking for a good Duke Ellington DVD, I highly recommend ""The Intimate Duke Ellington"" instead."
5,Very good guitar playing throughout the whole cd,"1-12, all good songs. good mixture of singing and screaming. if your into hard core heavy metal this is the cd."
4,Not there best work.,"Simply put. Vision of Disorder is an awsome band. On this release which is there debute album. The drumming is very good. The guitar work is very good. The lyrics are perfound, but the CD its self is very poorly produced. When Tim Williams screams on every track it sounds like its echoing off a wall or something. If your new to VOD I suggest you pick up ""Imprint"" or ""For the Bleeders"", or the bands latest effort ""From Bliss to Deveastation"" then buy this."
2,Very disappointed,"This is the only Jesus Christ Superstar Karaoke CD I have been able to find so I bought it despite poor reviews. Generally disappointed. Most of the tracks are too fast and they include some very odd arrangements in terms of instrumentation. Not the worst Broadway Karaoke CD out there, but not one I recommend unless you have no other choice (as was my situation)."
4,Jesus Christ Superstar karaoke CD set,"This is a great set of CDs. One CD has only instrumental and the other has voices plus instrumental, but you can turn off the voices by turning down the right speaker. We are using it for rehearsals and it is working out very well."
3,Stage Stars best effort.,"Stage Stars mostly got this one right. The tempo of ""Gethsemane"" is WAY too fast, but on the whole, musically and graphically, this is probably the best disc Stage Stars has ever produced."
1,A very bad sound,"I bought this CD because I needed a instrumental version of JCSS to work with an amateur theatre group.This CD can be useful if your objetive is sing with your friends or in the shower, but if you want to make scenes with a theatre group is not good. The sound is very ""electronic"". It seems to be made with a simple electronic keyboard. I don't recommend it."
1,waste of time,complete waste of time. not worth any of the pennies spent on it. did not do anything it promises. dont waste your time
2,Doesnt work for me,"I dont know I could just be using it wrong but I was surprised when it didnt trim a close as it said it would. Fine hairs, forget about it. That was what I got it for, to get the fine hairs that the larger trimmers dont get and to spare myself waxing. Now this product just sits in a storage bin as I wait for something I could use it on. I have had it for going on a year now."
2,Save Your Money!,"You can learn more from a quick online search. This book is similar to reading the biased posts on the authors' bulletin board/website. Lots of misinformation and outdated notions to scare patients into having aggressive treatment. I have Graves' disease and I think this book exaggerates things. This book makes it seem like all patients with Graves' disease are doomed clones. Also, some of the medical information is inaccurate. This book should have been looked over by a careful medical editor before going to press."
5,Great book for anyone who has graves or has a family member with GD,I love this book. Anyone who has Graves Disease I highly recommend this book and this book alone. It could not be told better. It brought me to tears while I read it because it was my thoughts and feelings exactly!
2,Light Reading,This book is fairly light reading. It would not satisfy those who desire more technical information. A large part of this book attempts to connect the reader to the personal experiences of fellow patients.
3,easy read but not that engaging,"Gross wrote an easy to read book that educates the reader about flying choppers in Vietnam and how the perspective of the war from a pilot's view differs from ground soldiers. But, I didn't feel his writing style to be emotionally engaging. The text had a few typos - some grammatical errors too. The language is rather plain for my taste.Not a bad story, and I do not intend to make any inference or judgement about the Vietnam war or the service Gross bravely gave his country. I am plainly reviewing the literature of it, not the history of it."
2,Rattler One-Seven,"Not well written, jumped around. It was like reading a log book. I did this or I flew today. Never got into what was happening around him or the missions he was flying. Not real interesting."
1,Ratt;er One-Seven,"Of all the books I have read about Vietnam this has to be rated at the bottom of the list. Obviously written by an amateur, the story was drab and uninteresting. He should have had some professional help in writing this book."
3,"Saved by ""Slave New World"" and ""BioTech Is Godzilla"".","I was eager to buy this album because I am a humongous fan of ""Schizophrenia"" and ""Beneath The Remains"" as well as ""Roots"", so I sorta expected this to be a cross between those two. I was right and wrong. As it turns out, I like the faster and more thrashy songs better, such as ""Slave New World"" and ""BioTech Is Godzilla""."
4,"Different style for Sepultura, but still good.","Instead of speed and thrash Chaos A.D. is more polished and is a must for those who like hard progressive metal, but the lyrics will alawys stay angery. Good metal album, but I would not suggest this to anyone really into Thrash/Death metal who loved their earler works(Morbid Visions, Beneth the Remains) for that reson."
4,creative and inspiring,"when i listened to this for the first time long time ago, i just thought . . hmmm this album is not as heavy as the previous one. i still liked it though.now when i go back to this album, now i consider this as a masterpiece. a very successful creative attempt of sepultura to widen their musical approach. it's an essential album for thrash metal fans. drum part especially is very creative with tribal tricks! i'm a thrash metal drummer myself."
1,When sep started to go downhill...,"If you been a fan of sep's first albums examples ? ""morbidvisions/bestial devestation? , "" schizophrenia"" , ""beneath the remains "" and the epic ""arise"" then don't even bother with chaos a.d by any chance because this was the album where sep changed their thrash roots and began playing hardrock then slowly changing into nu-metal which ruined their career. I used to love sep and every song these guys've made i realy cherish it and i was very happy with their albums...That was untill i heard chaos a.d. and after roots bloody roots,roots,against, nation, roar back etc. Realy dissapointing effort from a band that was once a thrash masterpiece.First problem with chaos ad was the sound change and max's vocals sounded like crap also the bass guitars sounded as if they were broke or something. The drums ? Weak. When i first heard this i even thought maiby they put the wrong cd in the case but nope its sep except with a new sound. Not recommended!"
2,This isn't Classic Sepultura,"I love Sepultura's old stuff. Everything from Beastial Devistation and Morbid Visions until the end of Cavalera's time with them. After buying all their early albums and demos, I was really excited to hear how this album compared. Being after Beneath the Remains and Arise, i thought they were in their prime. This album proved me wrong. This album is all slow riffs with possibly the worst attempt at vocals ever. In earlier Sepultura albums, I can actually say I enjoy the vocals. This album is just Cavalera screaming his head off. IT doesn't even sound good! The album has no special parts at all. It might as well be called ""The Prequel to Roots""."
1,I'M PROUD BUT...,"I'm very proud of having a metal band from my country making huge success around the world. But this is not enough to blind my eyes: they only make noise. THis Cd is a little better than ""Beneath"" and ""Arise"", but not much better. Anyway, they lost momentum with Max leaving the band, and they will never be the same again."
1,hoh,not as bad as soulfly but terrible anyway! listen to great bands like slayer and led zeppelin! the lyrics are just awful! i like vocalist's voice anyhow!
4,Extremely uncompromising!,"Let me begin by saying that this is the very first Sepultura CD I've bought. It is both raw and brutal from the very beginning to the very end! What I really like about the music is that Max (the lead singer) channels his rage at subjects like censorship, racism, prejudice, and corporate greed to name a few. It may sound like the band is constantly exorcising its own demons, figuratively speaking. In any case, this is speed/thrash metal at its best! Heck, these guys are even heavier than Metallica IMHO! I've also heard parts of Roots and all of Nation (w/new lead singer Derek Green). I'm thinking of buying more of the band's music. Very impressive!"
4,Choas A.D.,Not quite as good as Arise but it is different. So buy Arise first and then buy this. This give a more South American sound with out going overboard like Roots and maxs new band Soul Fly. The music is still good. Just not as good as Arise.
3,Thinking Man's Thrash,"The Boys from Brazil were well established in the thrash camp, but they weren't afraid to experiment. Even on their heaviest tracks, they blended in Brazilian tribal rhythms, as on the stark instrumental 'Kaiowas'. Songs with serious, informed lyrics about lands being torn asunder by war, greed, and corruption. 'Biotech is Godzilla' will appeal to those who like it dark and brutally fast, and the lyrics written by Dead Kennedy's Jello Biafra warn about the consequences of bio-technology in the wrong hands. Sepultura could arguably claim the cap of thinking man's thrash band."
3,A CHANGE OF PACE,"This CD marked a change of pace for this Brazilian band, and for the better. More structured and planned, the songs are better than before."
5,"Brought me back to the metal scene, kicking and screaming","For the longest time (10 years or so), I was not into heavy metal at all, but after suddenly cathing the ""War for Territory""-video on television...well, you can guess the rest!"
5,Best Sep Album,"I think this is the best Sepultura album. Loudy, noisy and great!. Choas A.D, War for Territory, Refuse/Resist are my favorites and sure We Who are Not as Othera and Biotech is wonderful.Max Cavalera..."
4,Best Sepultura album,"Brazilian band Sepultura reached the end f a phase with ARISE. Nwo they had to change, and a great change in the fantastic CHAOS A.D!! Great album!! Even MAx vocals are more bearable here!"
2,Interesting but not memorable,I enjoyed it and thought it would be more useful for older teens but it was an easy read and along the teen genre.
2,Puro divagar.,"Este libro no es inconoclasta. El único pecado que comete, es el de ser terriblemente aburrido y deprimente.La trama transcurre a paso de tortuga, y la mayor parte del libro consiste en un frustrante divagar del autor, emitiendo juicios pesimistas sobre la naturaleza humana.Este divagar que en otros libros como ""Historia del cerco de Lisboa"" era un mero recurso que agregaba color al argumento, en ""El Evangelio según Jesucristo"" se ha vuelto constante y errático. Y el tono general frustrante y deprimente del libro no ayuda para nada.No soy una persona religiosa, pero estimo que hasta los Evangelios canónicos serían una lectura más entretenida que este libro.No pude terminarlo (y eso que soy un ávido lector de casi cualquier cosa).Éste es justo el tipo de libro que uno cierra con rabia, lamentando el dinero gastado en él. Del talento de Saramgo algo se ve, pero muy, muy poco."
3,Pure Shlock,"When King Diamond was the singer for Mercyful Fate, he was an icon even though they only had two albums the first time around. He was an even bigger icon with his solo band called simply King Diamond, named after the singer. While those first three albums remain classics of thrash metal, here they devolve into pure shlock, as evidenced by the hideous album cover of King in lo fi makeup. Still a worthwhile album, the hideous album cover is very off putting, to say the least. Key tracks are At the Graves and Sleepless Nights. Gross..."
3,Not a bad album.,"I admit that Conspiracy isn't a favorite disc of mine, but there are some good songs on it though. I never have paid much attention to the lyrical concept of the album, but I do like the songs ""Sleepless Nights"" and ""A Visit from the Dead."" ""Sleepless Nights"" would have to be the best song I've ever heard from King Diamond--it's impressive. ""Visit from the Dead"" also has a nice intro and is a good song too. The rest of the songs don't really capture me, but they're still not bad. King Diamond has always been so different from other vocalists because he has a style all his own. Andy La Rocque (one of the guitarists) is also a very good guitar player. Conspiracy is worth a listen."
3,KD has done better,"I like the overall sound of this CD as well as the story, but the songs on here are just not very memorable. The disc starts strong with ""At the Graves"" and ""Sleepless Nights"" but then loses steam from there. ""Amon Belongs to Them"" is a stellar song mid-album but that's about it. I've listened to this cd several times over the past few weeks to get a really good feel for it, and I feel that 3 stars is right. 3 stars means 'okay' and I think that's what this disc is: okay.Would I recommend Conspiracy to fans of KD? Heck yes! But again, it's not their best."
5,outstanding movie,"I just love this movie. It is so powerful Tommie Lee Jones plays a great role. I believe everybody could relate to this film. I looked everywhere for this movie, and amazon was the only place I could find it. It was even better because I was able to watch it instantly. I would recommend this movie to anyone that's looking for a really good late night flick. Just make sure you have your kleenex."
3,A cinematic tour de force with fictional embellishments,"This visually stunning film captures most of the trauma-filled events from Le Ly Hayslip's inspiring memoir ""When Heaven and Earth Changed Places."" However,I was disappointed to see Stone taking creative liberty with the ending. Those familiar with Le Ly's book, know her American husband died of emphysema - he did not kill himself as depicted by Stone. Also, she was not dramatically rescued by him in a helicopter after getting caught up in a tide of fleeing refugees. In real life, her departure from the country was rather uneventful and took place in 1970 after her husband had already returned to the States. Read the book first."
5,Life of Lives,"WOW!!! One of a few I did not move from my seat. A story of survival, nurturing, and following a path of what was right and wrong.Completing a circle of life with in us all by searching with in."
4,Heaven & Earth DVD Review,A good film by Oliver Stone and fine acting by Tommy Lee Jones and others. High-quality picture and sound.
5,This movie will move mountains in your soul.,"I was gasping for breath, reaching for tissues, laughing, & holding on to the edge of my seat. It is very graphic, so be aware. It is also a wonderful yardstick for self reflection. This movie is a must for my video collection."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,The delivery was prompt but that excellent service don't make up for the defective product delivered. It started off picture perfect and around the midway point it started skipping and ultimately freezing on Tommy Lee Jones' mug. I personally think this is a huge inconvenience and a total waste of my time. Just based off this product I would not be conducting business again with this vendor.PURCHASE WITH CAUTION!
2,not good,"Pauline Kael pointed out what few critics have, that Oliver Stone is a lousy writer. That is certainly evident in this movie. The script is just a mess. But the lead actress' performance boosts this film up from a one star to a two star review. And it's amazing that she never acted a day in her life prior to this movie. You read about all these actors studying acting for years and years, and then learning their craft on stage before attempting films. But Haing S. Ngor was actually a medical student who went to keep a friend company who was auditioning. The casting people asked her to audition, since they liked the way she looked. She read and got the part. Those poor parents paying thousands of dollars for their kids to get drama degrees at Yale Drama School. I'll take an ""amateur"" Haing S. Ngor, any day."
2,A jumbled and unimpressive film,"I had thought that perhaps this movie, taking the original standpoint of a Vietnamese girl during the Vietnam war, could have had something very powerful to say. Instead I found it to be an incoherent film with very little organization. I found myself constantly questioning the motives of various groups, for example the Vietcong and their vicious attacks on the village even though they were trying to gain support among the farmers. I found the movie to be overly dramatic and poorly directed. All in all a less then average movie, which may have gained good reviews from its subject only."
1,"The book is great, the movie is a waste","I loved the book, so I thought I would enjoy the movie. Most movies are not as good as the book, but this one is just terrible. The movie is a confusing mess! The story line is very hard to follow. I was very disappointed. Do not waste your money like I did buying this one!"
3,too much squeaking,"Nice selection of tunes in wonderful arrangements and ably played by Mr. Ki. However, if squeaking guitar strings make you crazy (as they do me) this is not a disc for you. There are ways to overcome and/or lessen the amount of extraneous noise when playing a guitar; perhaps Patrick Ki should look into some of these. The remarkable guitarist John Williams seems to have overcome the squeak problem, but he ruins his recordings by humming/moaning as he plays, and that's ever worse (Glenn Gould too). I played Mr. Ki's disc once, and I will probably never listen to it again. I want to hear music as the composer(s) wrote it, with no extraneous noises."
4,Step by step manual for a beginner,"This tiny book accomplishes its task of guiding a FrontPage beginner through the steps of using the basic components of the program. Quick to read instructions are accompanied by lots of photo illustrations to show you how to insert text, tables, grahics and forms, and then explains how to publish your site to a web, (but unfortunately not how to make corrections once it's online). You can follow along on your computer to learn the basics in a very short time, but since the author has you open a new page each time you practice using one of the components, you don't get a feel for how to design and arrange a page with multiple items or how to move things around on the page. For this, and other unanswered questions, I need to get a more extensive book. Once learning the basics, this book may be handy to keep around as a quick reference in case you forget how to do something."
4,Very generic and great!,"This is the type of album that people will ask ""Is that Warrant? Poison? Ratt? STRYPER???"". It just sounds like a million other metal hair bands of the mid-late 80's. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. It's actually comparable to those many bands and you can easily listen to it. Solid playing, strong vocals make this good filler material for any playlist. You can be sure your friends will be arguing with each other over who it is.You'll be the hero of the hour when you tell them ""it's the guys who sang the theme to the original TRANSFORMERS movie""."
2,average80's metal,"When I saw this cd at a used cd store,I thought to myself who are these guys...never heard of them before....thought I'd try it.Was shocked when I saw the price$60.00 then saw it was from Japanthe clerk gave it to me for $12.00..Am I glad I only payed the $12.00...could barely tell one song from the other,they all sounded the same!Now I know why this cd was only released in Japan."
5,Raw Metal!...,"Even though some parts of this album sound kind of weard, it has killer riffs and contains b-sides with a first release EP. At first I didn't like it that much. I'd used to hear Track 1 on the Roadrunner site on King Diamonds page and it's one of the best tracks on the album. Then I understood why it sounds a little like Iron Maiden. Ofcourse it was the early 80's when it was raw demo versions for a start. They sounded great and very dated, and this album is really worth your while. If you still don't have it, Get it!"
4,Very Interesting...,"To start with, if you want to get an idea of how Mercyful Fate sounded, you can start with this one or Melissa or Don't Break The Oath. One of the earlier reviewers stated that she didn't see what was so great about the mighty King Diamond. Well he was a huge Alice Cooper and Kiss fan to start with and he simply took the facepaint of Alice Cooper and Kiss a little bit to far to scare off the Christians and the reason the great Norweigian bands (i.e. Darkthrone, Mayhem and Immortal) found him influential was simply because of the facepaint.I strongly suggest you go out and get this along with Melissa and Don't Break the Oath for more essential Mercyful Fate. Once you get past the satanic lyrics, you'll realize that each member was good at what they did on vocals, guitars and drums and also why Mercyful Fate is highly recommended in the heavy metal world."
2,terrible,these dvds are bad if your really into skateboarding these are not for you even if your not its not for you the music is really bad they show some of the same clips over and over again the only reasons i gave this a 2 is because sometimes they show some pros somethimes dont buy terrible if you do buy the dvds your going to regret it trust me
3,Solid but not great,"While I enjoy AZ, this is a very uneven CD. There are a couple of very good songs but most of the tracks are mediocre. I would recommend this only to the pure AZ fan..."
3,Buen recurso para el maestro pero no los estudiantes,Este texto es un buen recurso para el maestro de una clase de cultura y historia Latinoámericana pero no lo puedo recomendar para los estudiantes porque es muy lento de leer y denso en números estadísticos.
3,Fun prompts...but not practical,"I purchased this book because of the positive reviews. I am a parent, not a teacher. I think this is a great book to get prompts for an advanced class if you are really looking for something ""out of the box"". I was a little disappointed because this wasn't my purpose. My son's teacher said that he is struggling with ""style"" in his writing (6th grade). So I bought this book thinking that we could do one prompt per day to practice. However, all these prompts did was really frustrate him! Writing a story with out letters with dots (i's and j's) is kind of funny, but not at all helpful in developing writing skills. If I were a teacher that needed to come up with endless prompts to entertain large classes of kids, I would probably find this book helpful. As a parent needing practical help to tutor my son in writing...this book was a waste of money. We have since bought ""Razzle Dazzle Writing"" by Melissa Forney and it has been VERY helpful for our purposes."
4,fun ideas,"Many of the entries in this book are interesting and seem usable. I like to get some different writing ideas for the beginning of each year, so I was satisfied with this purchase. I think my 7th graders will enjoy some of these topics."
3,Let's Stay Balanced,"Let's not be one-sided. This non-personal approach may work for some (most reviewers agree), but not for all--as the title seems to indicate. I have found that when there is the OPTION, at least, of personal disclosure many students invest a greater interest in writing--both the writer and the reader.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
2,A nice backup,I would not recommend this for daily journaling. Its a nice resource to use for real writing prompts or to mix up journals. My students tend to hate the journals from this book.
4,Great ideas,"As a veteran writing teacher, I was wary of the 'not personal, not introspective, not boring"" claim, as I take the instruction of writing very seriously. However, I found the prompts very entertaining and an excellent way to coax even the most reluctant writer into sharing their thoughts. My 7th grade classes enthusiastically write for several minutes for these prompts, and any writing is a move in the correct direction, in my opinion. ""Unjournaling"" adds some spice into my writing instruction."
5,I Use thie everyday,"I use this ""Unjournaling"" guide everyday. It gives a twist to the usual journal entries often asked of teachers. I don't know what I would do without it!"
1,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY,"My son begged for this thing when we were on vacation and spent his hard earned money on it. The store manager opened the package and put the battery in for us to make sure it worked because he said sometimes they didn't.....that should have been my first clue. The first one didn't work properly. That should have been my second clue. He opened a second one and it worked fine. We packed it away in our suitcase because I didn't want to listen to that all the way home from our vacation. He got it out as soon as we got home and he and his sister played with it and had tons of fun. But two days later, there was nothing......the battery was fine and we even tried a new one. But nothing. This thing is a piece of garbage and was a total disappointment. I'm trying to contact the store where we got it to see if there is something they can do for us. But being that they are 1,000 miles away and we paid cash, I'm not holding my breath."
4,"Big time music saying""this is a good one!""","Kemuri is a japanese ska/punk band that will blow you away with their really cool horn section complimenting really catchy songs.Nothing new touched on here music wise,but they are one of the best of the genre.And it's cool that they sing some Japanese in some songs.I loved it!You'll love it!"
4,"An excellent album, with lots of good stuff for beginners.","On their U.S. release, ""Little Playmate,"" Kemuri shines through as a tremendous ska band. Crossing the tasty rhythm with the hot horn section, they have carved out a niche for themselves as masters of the genre. The vocals, though sometimes muddled (and occasionally in Japanese), have an excellent rhythm of their own, and in times are as much of an instrument as the rest of the band. Particularly check out the track ""Ato Ichinen"", one of the Japanese entries. This is an excellent CD to listen to if you are just getting into ska; it will truly win you over."
4,Kemuri is one of the many great Japanese ska-punk bands.,"Kemuri joins the elite group of terrific Japanese ska and punk acts along with Rude Bones and others. Kemuri busts out a killer beat while jamming with their three-piece horn section. A tremendously talented band, Kemuri might have rocked you at the Ska Against Racism Tour this spring. They are awesome, to say the least, on CD."
5,Simply fabulous,"Lisa Jewell has produced a witty, engrossing tale with Ralph's Party. The characters, especially the maudlin Siobahn, are so identifiable and quite fun. The twists and turns of this story are delightful."
4,Anglophiles say: Brilliant,"1. What is the text about?About two things: the dynamics of love in your 20s and 30s and to a lesser extent, London culture in the 1990s.2. What is good about it?The writing is solid; the author uses some writerly techniques that adventurous but generally work out; the story, though a little predictable, is compelling. It's also a little philosophical.3. What is not so good about it? The story's predictability-and its cuteness. It ""does"" women a little better than it does men.4. Who might like it?Anglophobes, anyone who likes a good quick but substantial read. Readers of ""chick lit"" for sure.5. Personal bias: Lived in London in the 1980s; a weakness for good relationship fiction."
3,"cute, funny... albeit not too deep","I quite enjoyed this book - I received it as part of a book exchange program and was told it was the ""male Bridget-Jones's Diary""(BJD). While it is from more than just one person's view, it *is* quite like BJD and Pride & Prejudice.I finished this book quite quickly - finding I just wanted to know what ended up happening to everyone. Easy-read and great book for a day at the beach or a holiday down South."
1,It is a Guy's World,I simply wanted to say that this book is nothing like Trials of Tiffany Trott or Making Minty Malone(Books others bought). They are humorous and sweet but I found Ralph's Party to be coarse and no fun. As the title implies it is about Ralph but I never liked him and I think the little humor that there is directed more to men. I couldn't even finish it but I did skim thru to the end and I really don't think I missed a thing. Any ladies out there who like Isabel Wolff I think Marian Keyes is more our style.
4,"Fun, Feel Good Book","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's not a great, profound literary work, but I had such a good time reading it. I liked the author's writing style, and I loved the many London references. I was a little annoyed by one of the main characters - Jem - and her silly ideas of destiny, but because she was not the only character whose perspective the reader has the benefit of, her annoying character quirks are forgiveable. I loved the way the author glided from one character's point of view to another's and I felt that she deftly created three dimensional personalities in each of them. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys light novels about single people in their late twenties/early thirties."
5,GREAT Book,This book is great. The characters are all very true to life and the dialogue between the characters is even more true. Lisa's style of writing sucks you into each scenario to the point of not wanting to put the book down. Can't wait for her next book.
5,"Extremely Enjoyable, Fast, Original & Fresh","This is a little gem of a book that the author wisely kept under 300 pages. I loved the story of Ralph and Jem, who find their way to one another through the trials and tribulations of her, first, being with his best friend and, then, Ralph's jump-starting himself as an artist with Jem as his inspiration. Another couple, a radio deejay and his live-in-girlfriend of fifteen years, come to a heads-on collision over his infidelity, which he shares with all of London on his radio show. I read this in one gulp. I found this novel more original than so many of these single people in present day London stories. It could be because this is the author's first novel and so her voice is very fresh. It may also be that she seems to have caught the males' points-of-view so well in the story. Women writers often have men behave as women would like men to behave but not as they really do. Jewell does not fall into that trap."
3,British Farce,"Jewell has created an amusing way for anybody to spend a few hours: reading this book.Her cast of characters is painfully and humorously drawn--each one has neurotic tendencies and each is somebody we can have sympathy for. I found this a really funny read--perfect for a plane ride across the pond! Beware the British English slang, though......"
3,"Not bad, but it's no ""Thirty Nothing""","I chose this book because I loved Lisa Jewell's ""Thirty Nothing"". ""Ralph's Party"" was full of different characters and story lines that all converge in the end - which was an aspect of the book which I enjoyed. But, like so many other books, the reviews called it funny, but I funny is not the way I would describe it. Poignant and sad, but not funny."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Ralph's Party is the kind of book that makes you feel as if you have to run out and buy every other book the author has written. (I did, starting with Thirtynothing!)Ever since I completed Bridget Jones, I have been hooked on this genre - the latest crop of books to emerge from London have fully satisfied this desire of mine!"
2,um.....boring......predictable......stupid,"I don't mean to be rude, but I HATED the main character of this book. She was completely pathetic and not even developed by Jewell. This book was very predictable and not a fun read. I recommend books like ""Dating Big Bird"" or even ""Local Girls"" for a fun read for women, that isn't degrading."
4,So much fun!,"I have grown a little tired of the ""Bridget Jones"" type books and was really expecting ""Ralph's Party"" to be similar. It is not-it is truly exceptional! It follows the lives of several different characters and although at first it was a little hard to keep up with/care about all of the characters, by the end of the novel I cared about each one. The character development was fantastic and Jewell does an excellent job of establishing a storyline and developing characters. I was actually sad when the book ended!"
4,Suspenseful in a quirky sort of way,"This book was so much fun to read. It's not deep, it's not groundbreaking. Just fun. Jewel has created very real characters, each of which the reader can identify with in one way or another. The only criticism I would have is with regard to lack of attention Jewel gives to Cherie. Without giving it away, Cherie is perhaps the most intriguing character of all!The story gets a little slow towards the middle but it makes turn and doesn't stop. I read the second half in one sitting. Enjoy..."
2,Average at best,Perhaps I just don't click with Lisa Jewell. I didn't find this book particularly funny or touching. Her characters seem dryly typical and the storyline has been done. At least it felt like it has been done. I wouldn't really recommend it.
2,Too long,"This book didn't have enough plot really. Characters are not developed, nor are they descriptive, very predictable. I really expected more from this writer."
3,Not as good as her later work,"I picked this book up after having read three other Lisa Jewell novels, and didn't find it up to the standards of her excellent later work, such as Thirtynothing and Vince and Joy. Don't get me wrong, this book still stands head and shoulders over the usual chick lit fare, but you can tell Lisa is still finding her voice as a writer here. The dialogue sometimes sounds artificial, and towards the end there are some unlikely character developments (Smith turns into a caricature of an arch-villain, Cheri the arch-villainess conveniently discovers her warm and fuzzy side).The book's final scene contains the sentence: ""This evening was in danger of collapsing under the weight of too much drama and coincidence."" Substitute the word ""book"" for ""evening,"" and you have my sentiments exactly."
3,A Differentn Perspective,"DH Hill is an important figure in the American Civil War. He commanded a Confederate Division from the Peninsular Campaign through Antietam, was responsibel for the defense of the Virginia and North Carolina coasts, and was with the Army of Tennessee for the Chickamauga Campaign. This biography covers all of that, plus his pre- and post-war careers as regulary army officer, author and educator.I would have liked more tactical detail, but it's also the only book covering the subject. It's also helpful to see the Virginia fighting from the perspective of a Confederate who didn't think Robert E. Lee walked on water. For the Civil War buff, keep in mind that this book is Hill's perspective only. You'll need a good history of the individual battles, and decent maps."
5,A positive rational method of decision making for complex issues,"Judith and Martin Land, co-authors of Adoption Detective, used the CBA method of decision making as a rational technique for weighing alternatives, estimating collateral effects, and making important choices to accomplish their goals. References: Page 279Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child"
4,Looked great,"Bought this as a gift for a friend. He's not much of one to wear jewelry really, but had thoroughly enjoyed both the bracelet and the message imprinted on it. He's received loads of compliments about it. Great product."
3,"Not great, but cheap","The part fits a 2002 Chrysler Sebring sedan, information that was not available here or on manufacturers site. There are different sizes for convertibles and coupes, as well as with or without spoiler. They could have shipped a hockey stick in the box it came in, kind of silly for a part that is a foot long. Clips are extremely thin, easily bent. Also, they do not actually lift the trunk lid like an OEM part. They do hold the trunk lid up, and they are quite inexpensive, so that is something. I would not buy this product again, rather I would spend a few dollars more and get a better part."
5,Trunk lifet support,Product was a snap to put on and has worked like the original and at a good price compared to the dealers.
5,StrongArm support,Replaced the arms on my 2001 Dodge Stratus. Worked like a charm and now I don't fear the trunk smashing my skull. And...the price was half that at the auto stores in town. Great product!
3,Why so much animosity,"Unlike another reviewer I could put this book down. I was just trying to understand all the animosity from the heroine toward the hero, but all I could come up with is it's a plot device. Agent Deandro is blind from an assassination attempt and has Abby for a bodyguard. Before he was shot he and Abby were lovers. They would prefer that no one knows about their affair, but when they are alone in the safe house Abby still treats Deandro with a strong dislike. She is suppose to be protecting him but she doesn't come across as a smart detective. She doesn't question things she isn't sure of. She is so busy trying to keep their affair a secret even from Deandro who happens to have amnesia. All this animosity and secrecy slows the story down."
4,A Close Interpretation of a Classic,"Conrad's look at imperialism and the destruction of Africa was an allegory shown by the inner destruction of Kurtz. This film plays out the slow trip of the short novel -- as slow and monotonous as the trip up the river was for Conrad -- an ocean sailor. But the Kurtz character gets lost in the mystery -- and his dark machine-like ablilty to kill is shown only in the contrived yet riveting scene with a pet monkey. Even the skulls are downplayed. Here too Kurtz is allowed to die and be buried in his village by those who ""love"" him rather than having him die on the way back -- for affect? It is an uneven and, at times, a slow piece. We don't find out much about Marlowe as well. But we get a true sense of Marlowe wishing to spare Kurtz's lover with a lie -- just as those selling ivory chose to lie about the circumstances."
4,"Climactic to say the least, more exciting than the book","Joseph Conrad's dark imagery in the book is only surpassed by the film techniques used in the movie. The directors use of light and dark contrasts to convey the underlying good and evil in the book is excellent. To me, where the book seemed to lack a definite climax, the movie took up the slack in order to give the viewer a heart stopping account of even the most minute details of the book. However, the movie does tend to ""drift"" away from the plot of the book at times. Also, Apocolypse Now is another movie that might be of use to those interestd in the book."
1,SAD ....,"Even taking in consideration the fact that this movie was made-for-cable, I can't understand how so much money and effort was wasted making this production. Everything is wrong. The actors seem to be on the verge of falling asleep; the book is totally destroyed; You end the movie feeling betrayed by the producers, after losing one and a half hour of your life watching this thing ..."
1,Boring and badly acted,"The negative comments by others some it up pretty well. A tedious film, badly acted and badly made. Boring. Good actors who made a turkey."
1,So dark it made fall asleep ...,"THis ""movie"" is totally misplaced, misdirected, I felt a sense of disconnection all over the place. If the intention was to translate into the screen a good book, it failed miserably. I feel the director is to blame; he's obviously conducting the picutre with no will at all. It's grostesqly bad."
2,If you want a movie version of the novel just rent Apocalypse Now,"I sort of knew it wouldn't be good when I rented it and I didn't even know it was a Made-For-TV-Movie then (my bad). Well anyway, it's the movie adaptation of the classic novel which is also the basis for Apocalypse Now. It does have some good acting from Tim Roth, the main character, Isaach de Bankole as their black helper who is also a cannibal, Morten Faldaas as the harlequin (the hippie in Apocalypse), and John Malkovich as Kertz (Brando's character). The problem is that the directing is pretty horrible. For most of the movie nothing happens and then the actual exciting part (where he meets Kertz) is way too short. The movie is very confusing and it doesn't really show what's supposed to be so significant about Kertz."
1,HEART OF PACIENCE !,"Tim ROth always accepted projects he judged would be different, that would have real potential to show his great talents as an actor. So, how he could have agreed to do this crap? MAlkovich is also in the same league. THe director seems to be wanting only to get rid of the project, finish the sooting, and then go home!"
3,"Not bad, but more for a younger crowd.","I read this book because I really like Historical Fiction, and I was hoping for a different kind of book. Instead of only reading about royalty, I wanted to read about the other people. I thought it was a good book in that way, and the plot wasn't bad, although it was pretty easy to figure out who was behind the accidents. I guess it was designed more for younger kids, like the 9-13 range. It's just that it was pretty obvious plot-wise and aside from that it was just your standard historical fiction book. So, I think the younger set would like it, but teens might want to look elsewhere for a good Historical Fiction book."
4,Bird Greens Dilemma,"I have several birds 4 Paraketts and one Amazon. And they are crazy about these Dri Greens. They prefer them above their seeds and they always clamor for more. The dilemma comes in when I open the package to dole out the greens. I always find a fine cloud of dust which unless you put on a mask. You cannot avoid. This causes a strong fit of sneezing and coughing among us . So I would advise any one who uses this product if they have a weak respitory system, sinus or allegies. To think carefully before using this product"
2,Shoumei White Tea is okay,I really prefer the Shoumei Green Tea which is one of the only green teas I can find that isn't bitter. The white tea doesn't have any sweetness to it and isn't much fun to drink. I only drink it because it's good for me.
4,In depth view for An-2,"This book is one of the most complete work about this amazing aircraft. In general it is hard to find precise information about this sort of aircraft, which is not a front line fighter. The book is well documented with a lot of rare photos."
1,I hate to do this,"This cd is terrible! It's true.. Melissa is the best old-school metal albumn there is, but this cd is garbage. When it was re-released on Roadrunner they remixed the vocals of the song Melissa (track 7) and is absolutely terrible. If you're going to buy this record (or if you own the new copy) go to a 2nd-hand store and get the one releaed by Megaforce in 1983. (20286-7369-2) It's going to be a tough challange to find an original, but the difference is astounding and you'll have a newfound appreciation for the song."
3,"Primitive, although original.","This is a very primitive album. Guitar solos are pretty mediocre -or primary. The arrangements are dated and not very interesting. King Diamond's vocals are still taking shape here, and the songwriting is puerile and weak -althogh very sincere and with some ""magnetism"" for the time. The production is a pity. Overall, this albums is worth because its groundbreakingness (it's the root of gothic and black metal), but there's very few here (if something!) to loose your head for. Not to much to offer if you're used to King's Diamond solo albums. I give to it 3 stars because I know what came after, but this album deserves 2 stars on its own -you fans, kill me for saying this, but still don't dare to compare this to ""Abigail"", ""Them"", ""Conspiracy"", ""The Eye"" or even ""In The Shadows""!In few words: a collector item without many good things to offer. You'd better go for the aforementioned releases. Believe me: this is NOT a masterpiece at all!"
5,"Horrifying, just the way I like it.","I am convinced that this disc is one of the great unsung classics of hard rock. It's near-flawless, and certainly stands up to anything that Metallica or anyone else did in the same time period. This is harsh music that is stunningly visual as well as intensely visceral: the brutal thrash riffing and drumming pummels the listener into the bloodstained earth, while the tight neoclassical passages evoke the architecture of (perhaps) a Gothic castle. This is topped by King Diamond's now-growled, now-shrieked tales of witches, curses and everything evil. A must-have for fans of 80s metal and particularly the speed and black metal schools. Frightening...the way it should be."
5,MISSY'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!,"Everything about this album is great.MetalheadMissy has apparently taken my thoughts. THANKS!Sincerely, NITEMARE"
5,Mercyful Fate's best,This is death/Satanic metal at its finest. Every song is great and the guitar riffs are fast and furious. This is the definitive Mercyful Fate album.
5,One of the Best,"This is one of the greatest albumns in my collection. It is heavily satanic, but with enough ultra-fast guitar riffs to keep any metalhead happy. I really like Satan's Fall, and Melissa is a great and beautiful song, revolving around gothic and evil love....something I can connect with. For anyone with appreciation for metal, I highly recomend Melissa."
4,"very, very good album","BUT, I still like ""Don't Break the Oath"" just a little bit better. However, I do have to say that of the 175+ concerts I've been to during my lifetime, that Michael Denner and Hank Shermann are the BEST guitar duo I have ever seen live ! ! !"
4,A lesson in guitar rhythm,"Folks, just listen to what guitarrists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner has done in this album. Anyone who pretends to play heavy metal should listen to that!!! It's soft, heavy, smooth, fast, slow, touching, agressive, everything that is possible to describe! The weak point is, as always, the ridicule lyrics by King Diamond. But the heavy music...it's amazing."
3,This shirt shrinks!,"I bought an XL, but it now fits like a medium! Im not getting FATTER, it's the shirt shrinking! It was great for about a year, but after a while it just doesn't fit the same way. If I were you, I would buy this shirt a few sizes larger than you want, and expect it to shrink in the wash!-C. Cole Phd"

4,good player but has bad hdd,"i bought a refurbished one 6 months ago, now it has an hdd (hitachi travelstar c4k40) porblem. i searched the forums and lots of people has same hdd problem, i think rio is more useful (especially crossfader option is so nice) than ipod but ipod hdd's has better operation system so if it damages or has bad sectors, ipod ignores that parts and you can use the non-bad sector parts. but in rio when its hdd damages or has bad sector you cannot use the rest of the free space. i was able to use only 600mb of free space until yesterday, and now it is totally gone :("
4,Unexpectedly easy to set up and use,My family has wanted an MP3 player for a long time. I thought about an Ipod but a neighbor complained its not pocket friendly. So I did my research and went with the Rio Karma. Why Rio stopped manufacturing this product is beyond me. If you read and follow the directions I was copying music from my computer to the player in 10 minutes after registering the product and doing updates. It is scary to read about locking up but so far I am looking for another one for my son already. If you have downloaded music and burned a cd with the music it really is no harder than that. Glad I bought this player!!!
4,RIo Karma,"This player is the only player I have found that can play back Ogg Vorbis files. I've used that codec to store my entire CD collection, so I really had no choice. It has a vast number of playback modes, good sound, and okay battery life - about six hours or so before recharging.The downside is that as far as I have found, it cannot play legally downloaded song files from iTunes (which uses ATRAC) or Napster (which uses WMA). So unless you only want to listen to MP3s or tracks ripped from your CD collection, getting new tunes (legally) could be a problem. For a few hundred dollars more, you could get an iPod that lets you do both that, and connect to iTunes.Still, I like the Rio Karma, and it works well for how I use it."
1,"Stopped working, very bad customer service","My Rio Karma worked fine for a couple of months. Then, without any apparent reason, it stopped working. It would freeze and prompt a message ""Bar Karma"" or bad hard drive. This was after the very short 3 months warranty. I called customer service several times and they were not helpful at all. I am not buying another product from Rio ever again."
3,"""For Novelty Use Only""","Still dont remember why I bought this DVD, or why it sat for 4 years before watching it. Anyway, this movie is a real hoot. From Don Johnson's premiere as an 18 yr old Prom Queen lookalike with a sidearm to Country Joe's surreal insertion into an old west shoot-em-up saloon. The whole thing is just twisted as hell, and semi-fun.A recommended rental with a 6 pack. 3 tokes."
3,"Heavy, man.","The only way to ""get into"" this film, as we used to say, is to pull out the bong, turn out the lights and maybe watch it in tandem with VANISHING POINT, another ""lost movie"" from the Seventies. Otherwise, you may want to remember that some things aren't nostalgia, they're just dated.Oh, yes, do all of this at midnight...the vibes are better then."
1,It has to be seen to be believed.,"Idiotic quasi-hippie western about two young gun-slinging pals (John Rubenstein and Don Johnson) who, of course, end up facing each other in the obligatory climactic fateful shootout scene. Better yet, Country Joe & the Fish appear as bumbling bandits, the James Gang appears for no apparent reason, and the great Elvin Jones is ace gunfighter Job Cain, who cooly blows away the hot-headed upstart then sits down and plays a drum solo."
5,Get the book! It will invigorate your auditions!,"I LOVED this book! We actors all know what it's like to not prepare the way we need to for an audition. In reading Margie's book, I realized it's not just fear (masked as paralysis or procrastination) that keeps us from preparing. It's cause we aren't sure what questions to ask -- questions that will REALLY stimulate and plug us in when we only have 10 minutes, an hour, a day -- at any rate, not 4 nice, long weeks of rehearsal -- to bring life to the role. Just by reading this, I felt like I had taken a course. For seasoned actors as much, if not more, than for beginners. A handbook of what we could all stand to be reminded of. This book has made auditioning FUN again."
5,Great Audition Book for Actors,"This book gives alot of practical information about the Audition process and the actors interview. Also in the book is the ""The Harber Phrase Technique"" specifically created by the author. There is advise on your pictures and resumes and more.I really liked the real-life stories given by popular actors and actresses about their audition experiences.This a is a great book for any actor who want to have better auditions and get more call-backs."
3,Can you judge a book by it's cover?,"Margie's book is a MUST for any actor who has ever asked the question ""Why don't I book more jobs?"". Margie shows the actor how to dig deeper into the life of the character and also helps actors connect to the material.My complaint is to the Shipper. The book Cover is cut off and the top of every page is cut off. It looks like a cheap re-print."
2,"Pretty, but not durable","The cross itself is very pretty, but unfortunately the hoop broke off just days after being worn for the first time. It didn't take much effort at all, I just accidentally dropped it on some grass and the hoop broke off, so now I have no way of wearing it. It's very cheaply made, but the design is very nice, and there's no denying that's a beautiful piece of jewelry. Buy at your own risk."
5,A Very Nice Piece of Jewelry,"This necklace is nice made, looks elegant and makes a great statement. It is packaged nicely and is a great addition to my collection, I'll wear it often."
4,"Very undersized, but looks decent.","As a three-time buyer from Dan's Jewelers, I know what to expect. I've always been impressed with every necklace I've bought from them but, much like the guitar necklace, I'm disappointed on the size of the pendant itself. I mean, it doesen't look bad when you wear it and there is obviously a lot of detail here but I think it should be much bigger to show that detail. I'd really love to see a bigger version, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. The biggest pendant I've seen from this seller is the bearded dragon, which is borderline huge but it looks great and I think this would be an awesome follow-up. It's a cool pendant, very tarnished-looking."
5,Awesome!!,"Overall:Quality merchandise,modest prices, prompt delivery. I was so happy when I discovered Dan's Jewelers. I had tried relentlessly to find this specific type of jewelry that I ,and/or others I know, identify with. At last I found just what I was looking for. This was my second time ordering from Dan's Jewelers and definitely not the last time. I am very pleased with how quickly my order arrived and was happy to know that the jewelry is well made and looks awesome. If you find something that interests you, I definitely reccomend Dan's Jewelers."
3,"Sesame Street - A Celebration of Me, Grover","My son is 11 months old and he loves Sesame Street. But this DVD isn't one that he loves. I think it's for older kids. I do think that they should do an entire collection of ""A Celebration of Me"" for all of the Sesame Street characters. It's a very cool DVD, just not for little kids that like a lot of songs in their DVD's. There are more skits then songs. But I do recommend it."
3,A Bit Disappointing,There was too much new (bad) content and very little classic Grover on this disc. I really was annoyed at Elmo being in too much of it.
5,Just what she wanted!,"I was so happy to find this dvd. My 2-year-old daughter has been fascinated with Grover for several months. Funny thing, it all started with her love of Yoda. One day we were watching Sesame Street and she perked up, running to kiss Grover on the tv, calling him Yoda. She recognized the voice, so since then I have searched for a Grover dvd. I finally found this one and it is so nice. Very cute, very sweet, classic Grover! Yea!"
5,The Best of Grover,"Like Gonzo, Cookie Monster and Herry, Grover is a lovable, furry blue monster. Everybody likes him except Fat Blue, the man who Grover always sells stuff to. It shows all the great things Grover has done and all the things he did as Super Grover. I like the fact that Kermit was in this. They ARE best friends. The Best of Grover is a great video!Muppet Performers: Carroll Spinney,Frank Oz, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson, Kevin Clash, Fran BrillMuppets: Big Bird, Oscar,Mumford,Bert,Ernie,Zoey,Elmo,Fat Blue,Grover,KermitPublishers: CTW,Jim Henson,Sesame Street Home Video, Sony Wonder"
2,River Ran Dry,"I really wanted to like this album, especially considering how much I enjoyed the first 2 LOA releases but it is just truly uninspired, bland, downright bad music. The only songs that I can listen to are Weeds, Heroin Dreams, and My Mind Is Dangerous. The rest is garbage in every sense of the word. Sometimes I'm a fan of change, such as the change from RRR to Ugly, but this is mostly unlistenable, regardless of all other factors."
3,Different but Good,At first I didn't like this album but it grew on me and I realize it was a great album. You couldn't expect them to make the same record every time. But I recommend you buy the other albums first. My Mind is Dangerous is a slow song but it is one of my favorites off the album.
3,Don't give up on them just yet,"OK, so this album was nothing compared to the other two, but don't give up on them just yet. This album was keiths influence and they only went along with it b/c they (like most of us) were probably afraid to lose his amazing voice. Have faith, the next album is suppposed to be heavy, like the first album."
4,Very Good,I don't know why these people takes time to critic so badly about this Cd... It's much better than the previos two albums.
5,Korn and Orange 9mm take note.,From the excellant stop/start schizozoid guitars and lyrical anger of Hope and Weeds to the achingly serene Desire a true nihilistic masterpeice. Stuff the likes of Radiohead and Kill Holiday this is emotional music at it's very best.
5,i'm weird,"i'm pretty much a NYHC kid. i love punk and alternative but never really liked metal and i stared listening to a ny/nj area college station that plays LOA ALOT. i was hooked. i was though unfortunate enough to be 12 when they broke up but, i think that this cd is one of the best albums i have ever heard. keith caputo has one the most amazing singing voices i have ever heard and sappy as it may seem to say this ""my mind is dangererous"" is one my favorite songs not just from them but of all time. they WERE a semi-gothmetal group like type-o but change is very,very good in there case and i swear i'm not biase because they are the only one of my favorite bands from my hometown."
1,is this a joke?,what happened to this talented band? total disaster. ridiculous. i dont even know how else to describe this nonsense. they started off making one the best hardcoe/metal albums of the nineties and turned into total wuss rock. wtf?
1,LOA fans save your money,"Well here we go again, another awesome band sells out. I only wonder if they had a band meeting to decide they were going to suck. A entirely different sound and feel that they can't ever seem to convey to listener makes this album just one more ""Aimed at the Masses"". I for one am done spending my money on them."
1,"No ""zero star"" option for ranking","""River Runs Red"" is a masterpiece. This CD is not worthy to serve as a frisbee."
1,Actually 1/2 Star,"This album is awful. This was LOA's most blatant attempt at commercialism, but it does not work whatsoever. By this time in their career, Keith was disinterested and distraught and you heard it in his lack of effort. The album is jumbled with different styles generally not done well. Aside from the excellent Lead You Astray, this album is a poor attempt at too many styles of music."
3,"Technical Content Okay, Political Content boring","The technical content of this book will not dissapoint you. I owe Steven at least a million dollars (-:)) for all the times his books have saved my as* when coding pl/sql. The most interesting thing about this book is not the technical content, but the political views Steve dumps on you via the coding examples and in the dedication of the book (""Free Mumia"" of all causes). I don't know about you, but the last thing I want to pay for is political sermon from a pl/sql expert."
3,Technical side: 5+ stars; Political side: 0 or less,"Pro: Great reference for Oracle 8i PL/SQL, a bit lacking in the Java side, but for the rest is really good.Con: Mr. Feuerstein should leave politics out of the book. He has the right to hold any political view, which by the way I don't subscribe to, but this was supposed to be a technical text that should help readers all over the world, not only those in Berkley who vote left wing.Next time he better stick to the usual, neutral and actually more useful, examples."
2,"Great technical reference, bad political humor......",would gave this book 4 stars if it wasn't for the bad political jokes and awkward plaements of them such as 'in code'. I recommend Oracle PL/SQL by Benjamin Rozenweig(it even features an actual database to perform against.) Please keep in mind this recommendation is for beginners.
3,Technical vs Political,"I was kind of surprised to see that his political views (which I was aware of via his website) made it into his book. More surprised that O'Reilly allowed them into the book, but then again...if they didn't then there would be no free speech for Steven.His political views aside, I enjoyed all the little nooks and cranies (especially NDS - Native Dynamic SQL). NDS is more like a big chunk instead of a nook and crany. This has saved me hours of extra coding. Also the other new features are excellent. More Java is definitely apropo, less politics. Though I am not as offended as most reviewers of the book, I do agree with them. Especially about Mumia (sp?). Leave politics out of it. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.Looking forward to your next book Steven.Gio"
4,Better Hurry Before They Are Gone,"We bought this old technology memory because we bought an old technology E Bookwise book reader (that takes this memory) to see if we'd like electronic books before springing for the much more modern (and expensive) Kindle.We do like the reader and like the convenience of buying books online. This memory card does the job of storing multiple books so we can wait for book sales.My guess is that these cards can't compete with modern memory systems so if you think you'll need one for your old system buy it now while they are at ""fire sale"" prices."
4,Great Hard to Find Item,"Was working on a multimedia project that required the old SmartMedia Card...no one had any available...""out of stock"" or no longer carried. Amazon help me find exactly what I was looking for and the project turned out great!"
4,Delusions of Grandeur,"For anyone who was shocked out of their seat by ""Dog Days"", may find this worthy follow-up effort a notch below BM's debut. Although a great record on its own, BM fails to recapture the magic it found in 1995. The song writing and playing is still strong, although some of the lines sound a bit canned and corny. ""Bloody 98"" and ""Myrna Lee"" are as good as anything they've ever done, but it tough for us to get all the inside jokes in lyrics like ""Seven years and still a gas"" from ""Babe"". Regardless, this is a worthy effort that keeps BM fans hoping for still more.PS-Their live show rocks!"
1,Bluh,"Unforutantely i did not get any helpful information out of this book pertinent to my own situation, i'd say for some it could be great but nothing helped me with the raising of my son in this book for any of the issues we had that arose"
3,ok,This book was highly recommended to me. I do not like the format of the book--but the content is good.
5,The best Mischief yet,After the horrible Mischief Invasion I almost didn't buy this one but I'm glad I did. I think the guys at Teckademics knew that they had to make up for the past few week series. Total time I believe is about 192 minutes so there is alot to watch. If you're a fan of street racing or cars in general you gotta buy this.
1,THERE IS NO MUSIC ON THIS CD!!!,"Buyer beware. This is a PICTURE CD. It misleads by saying it's an audio CD. It is clearly marked on the CD: ""This album does not contain music""!!!!!"
4,Good value for money,"This is a basic speakerphone that is good value for money and can be used as a backup if there is no power in the house (or the cordless is out of battery :-)).Pros- Simple to install- Reasonably sturdy, the handle has fallen off a few times and has not shown any damage- Speakerphone is ok to use when you are listening in (or waiting for customer service, etc)- good backup phone that works fine without powerCons- Speakerphone is not great when you are speaking. It is not as good as the new duplex speakerphones (in most cordless phones)"
5,"These Are Some Funny Foreigners, Hell of a Show Here","This show delivers each and every episode. With their unique blend of dry humor and surprisingly pleasant ""novelty band"" songs, it's hard not to keep a grin above your chin. I first saw their stand-up, and then had the privilege of stumbling across these DVDs after the show was all ready off the air(by the choice of Brett and Jermaine). I really enjoy all aspects of this show, and I wish they had signed on for additional seasons. Who knows, maybe they come back for more seasons like I think Larry David has done with Curb Your Enthusiasm. Splurge on yourself, you can't go wrong with this package.(Note:Limited Tracks on included Soundtrack)"
3,"Quirky Comedy, Offbeat Characters","""Flight of the Conchords"" combines the offbeat humor of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" with the colorful characters of ""The Office"" to come up with some very funny shows. The dialogue often involves extended conversations that get weirder and more surreal as they go on -- not exactly the speedy repartee of Abbott & Costello's ""Who's On First?"" but a comedy blend comprised of a pinch of Jerry Seinfeld, a helping of Larry David, a few sprinkles of vaudeville, and several measures of Monty Python.Bonus extras are plentiful and include a mini-documentary featuring Bret and Jermaine at their droll, deadpan best; ""Dave's Pawn Shop"" mock TV ads; snippets from meetings with the inept manager and his associate Greg; deleted scenes; and outtakes."
5,Love this series... one of the best ever!,I could watch and re-watch each episode over and over again. Always enjoy it. It's a shame it only went for 2 seasons. I wish there was a DVD that had only the music videos so I could play it at parties.
5,Great Show and Great Bundle,"This is a great bundle for those who like Flight of the Conchords. It's witty, funny, and utterly enjoyable. Having both seasons and the music CD for a pretty reasonable price is great. I highly recommend this."
4,Gentle fun,"Flight of the Conchords is about a New Zealand duo, Brett and Jermaine, trying to make it in the music business in New York, with the aid of their hapless manager. It's gentle fun. The musical pastiches are impressive."
5,It's 'Jemaine' not 'Jermaine',"Come on FOC purists! Time to get this right. There is no 'Jermaine Clement,' in FOC, the actor's name is actually 'Jemaine' Clement."
4,Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Collection,"A funny show that even if you have never seeany of it, will draw you in . A very rewatchable series with songs that get stuck in your head... it's Business Time......"
4,Downunderer!,"I have always been a fan of satire, sarcasm and droll humor, and these guys got it right the first time. Their regular meetings with their manager, in which he takes roll of all three present, including himself, is reminiscent of ""The Office"" at its best. The ever-changing New Zealand posters on his wall, which generally try to distinguish their country from Australia, are always amusing and sometimes hilarious. And the jokes at Australia's expense are some of their best. Their music is all over the place in terms of style, but always very good and funny. ""Too Many Dicks on the Dance Floor"" may be my favorite for its overall presentation. Their TV musical career is not taking off any time soon since they play to audiences as small as one."
3,Nice but not so universal,"It is a nice product and it is very slim. However, it is not so universal. I bought this for my 26"" Samsung but the holes do not line up so I was not able to use this at all."
1,Stereotypical Action Movie,"Terrible...Just such a terrible movie. I like my share of cop drama movies but this particular film proved exactly why it went straight to DVD release. There was just too much bad acting, especially from Chris Klein, who was practically screaming all the time while ""trying"" to justify his actions and involvement in a dirty cop case. The twist at the end was short-lived and I felt like I wasted at least 90 minutes of my life after watching it. Don't bother to watch or buy this movie!"
1,Worst movie I've rented in a long time.,"Not going to waste much time on this. Don't bother with this. It has got to be the worst thing I've seen in a long time. The writing is cheesy, the acting is horrible, the story boring and contrived. Save your time and money."
5,GREAT REFERENCE,"As a reader and writer, I use it all the time in sorting out idioms/slang from different places and eras. It's also important to my wife as she uses it as a translator, assisting Filipino people with native Tagalog to English/American. For example, she asked me last week what ""DI"" meant (saw and heard the term on TV), and why were they so mean. I knew about the Drill Instructor part, but their meanness would only be explained by being there at boot camp and preparing their recruits for real battle. I highly recommend this dictionary - a valuable resource for any library."
4,dictionary of Am. slang,"Even though I primarily had my grandchildren in mind when I purchased this book,their whole family has enjoyed reading through it !P. Jenkins"
4,"Good book, but some slangs are not included","Whats the meaning of ""ate up""? There are some other slangs that my friends were using, that they could not find in this Dictionary. But, at least I (a foreigner) have found a reliable sheild against American conversational abuse which I adore so much."
1,I doubt this dictionary,"I have a ""New Dictionary of American Slang"" written by this author in 1986. I didn't like the book from day one, but at the time I couldn't find a different one. No example in the dictionary is from the author himself. This is something I don't like at all. Moreover, many words are not included in the dictionary. I'm now looking for a better slang dictionary definitely NOT BY THIS AUTHOR."
4,Keeps things moving along...,"After trying a variety of different probiotics (and spending a lot of $), I'm sold on Daily-Dophilus. Two pills in the morning and two pills at night help keeping things *ahem* moving along smoothly for me. My husband just uses one pill each for am/pm, and says it works great for him.The price on Amazon is cheaper than any place else I've found it, even when on sale. Definitely a keeper!"
5,Fantastic Peel,"I've been using this product for several years and have noticed a huge difference in my skin; in my humble opinion, it's a better expenditure of money than a professional chemical peel. The results are as dramatic!"
1,3 Years Passed Expiration,"sadly, this product had a 2007 expiration date. I basically paid top dollar for an unusable product. I will never purchase from this vendor again."
2,Nothing different,"I have been using this for about 3 months now, but I don't really see any differences."
1,Do not buy this!,I had some acne scarring and bought this product hoping it would help. Not only did it do nothing for my scars it also made my pores look huge. Buying this facial peel was a HUGE MISTAKE! Don't waste your money on this facial peel.
5,The best and safest facial peel.,"I use Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Fadial Peel twice per week and have been using it for three years. It removes all makeup residue and super cleans my skin. After each treatment, my skin feels smooth and new! It's amazing how much (dead skin cells, clogged pores and the effects of modern life) this product removes in just ten minutes, and without any adverse reactions - even though I have sensitive skin. This is a wonderful product!"
2,Unimpressed,"Been using this one to two times a week for over a month now and it hasn't done a thing. It barely stings when I put it on. It has a slight grainy texture so you get a little exfoliating action when you wash it off so that's good. It doesn't smell terrible at all. But it was definitely not worth that $30-some-odd I spent on it. No peeling afterwards... a whole lot of nothing, and my skin still looks the same: constant breakouts."
4,late in their career but still powerful a show,"this was after the civilized cd was released,I prefered the first three cd to everything else the did and this was recorded after thier prime and without bobby hambel so both being a big minus butthe still sound pretty damn good and have alot to prove with thier atittude and musical skills to boot.A great deal of the show was make up of the first three cds with about 6 songs of the mata leao cds unfortuntly i would have rathered it would have been entirely from the first three cds because they couldn't touch the fury they had on those cds until means to the end and that cd was realy great but still needed more of the original biohazard stamp to be put on it.but no holds barred is the best reminder of how it was since they never offically released a offical cd back in the day when they were in their top form."
5,totally awsome!!!!,if your into to biohazard and love all there songs like me then this is the cd to buy!!!!! has everything from the old to the new!!! the whole recording is good quality and the music is heavy !!
4,Classic Black Metal,"This is an excellent heavy metal album. The production on this album is crisper than Melissa, with better separation and clarity. The song hooks and riffs aren't quite as strong as Melissa, but the composition is a bit more advanced and the playing is tighter."
4,"It is Sad That ""9"" (the new CD) Isn't As Good As This One!","After hearing ""9"" I was convinced that MERCYFUL FATE was VERY VERY OVER-RATED. I had heard the band's name for years and couldn't believe how ""generic"" they sound on ""9."" I told my guitar teacher (Dave Kinsey at Mega Music) about my disappointment and he suggested I listed to DON'T BREAK THE OATH. It isn't the greatest production I've heard (which is why I only gave it 4 stars), but it has a very original feel, good lyrics, good art and a production that disguises the singer's occasional sour notes. After hearing this album I can understand why people from the 80s generation of music liked Mercyful Fate. After almost twenty years of playing in a band together you would expect that the band had gotten better and that the singer would have learned to stay on key, but they haven't. It's too bad the new CD ""9"" isn't nearly as good as ""Don't Break The Oath."" If you are going to buy an album by Mercyful fate this should be the one you get."
5,SATAN'S FAVORITE ALBUM!,"ALL TIME GREATEST METAL ALBUM EVER RECORDED, NO IF'S AND'S OR BUT'S, GREATEST EVER, PERIOD. LAYS WASTE TO EVERY THING ELSE. MERCYFUL FATE MAKES BANDS LIKE SLAYER AND ICED EARTH SOUND LIKE N'SYNC,IF YOU DON'T BELEVE ME THEN YOU HAVENT LISTENED TO THE ALMIGHTY FATE. THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER HEAVY METAL ALBUMS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TOP OF THE HEAP BUT THIS IS THE ONE I WOULD CHOSE.YOU HAVE KING DIAMOND FOR CHRIST SAKE! THE MAN CAN SING SO EVIL THAT IT COULD GIVE A PREIST A HARD ATTACK!"
2,Foolish...,"This CD portrays a sad history.... Strong and creative riffs, amazing guitar playing by Shermann and Denner, precise drum playing by Kim Ruzz, great metal music.... All that arsenal at the disposal of one foolish singer called King Diamond, who, for this album, wrote some of the most pedestrian satanic lyrics ever. Seldom have I heard such a quantity of [junk] coming from the mouth of a singer. Other than this, his screaming only served to make Fate lose a lot of potential fans and buyers.FIVE STARS FOR THE MUSIC.ZERO STARS FOR THE SINGER."
