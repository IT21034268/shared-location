1,Severely bent cans. Amazon needs to adopt a policy of full disclosure.,"The cans I received were severely bent. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well. Amazon needs to indicate the condition of the canned good they are selling (or at least mention the possibility of the cans being bent, because it is starting to appear from the number I have received that they are selling damaged canned goods). I had to throw one of the cans away since the product in it smelled off."
1,HIGH IN SUGAR- DO NOT FEED TO KIDS!!,"I was happy to see that Amy's soups have reduced the sodium, BUT this stuff has as much sugar as a cup of chocolate milk, or even more... it's like eating tomato jam!! awful stuff.. Like most Amy's soups recipes, it has added sugar cane juice. Others have corn syrup... when my mom made soup, she never added sweetners to her soup.. Amy's soups is no different than the large brands.. high in sodium ( except for a few new recipes w/low sodium), and high in sugar...NO wonder our kids have diabetes, are overweight, and have high blood pressure. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE SOUPS TO FEED TO KIDS. You are better off making your own soups and freezing them in containers.. tons of recipes online."
1,What's with all the sugar?,"Worst soup ever!!!! It has so much of sugar, remembering it makes me go sick in the tummy. I guess I will stick to buying what I generally buy at Safeway. This soup was awfully sweet and unpalatable."
4,"Interesting background for musicians, but be careful","It certainly broadens one's knowledge and appreciation to study the physical dances that so much of Bach's instrumental music was based on. But there's a difference between music written to literally accompany dance and music stylized in the form of dances, meant primarily for listening. Bach did not play Saturday night dance gigs in Leipsig nor did Chopin play his waltzes in Parisian ballrooms. Tempos (and flexibility within those tempos) need not be based on realistic assumptions of how people may have actually danced bourees and minuets. There were enough differences in style among Italian, French and German strains of late Baroque music (and dance) that one should be cautious about any definitive rules here. That being said, the book is well written, illustrated and an interesting read."
4,An account of a cattle drive from Texas to Nebraska,"This novel won the 1964 Spur Award for best western novel of the year. It is a realistic account of a cattle drive involving 3000 head along the Western Cattle Trail from a ranch about 50 or 60 miles west of San Antonio, Texas, to Ogallala, Nebraska, in the late 1870s or early 1880s. It is obvious that this Texan author did research in preparation for this story (which I read very fast and enjoyed)."
5,nice job,"The author did a nice job of writing a book that holds the reader's interest. He avoids the trap of falling into a ""formula western"" and deveolps the characters and plot nicely. I enjoyed reading it very much."
3,Journalistic title from famous scholar,"Haggard has a good name in East Asia field. but this title disappointed me. it's not that scholarstic but journalistic. what are enumerated on his book is not new or insightful at all to asian specialist. if you have read articles on Asia from FT or Wall Street Journal, The Economist, You should know what I mean. at best this book is no more than enlarged The Economist."
4,i like it,its hard to find this in regular grocery stores. unlike the other reviewer i really like the flavor and texture. if you look at the box it states there is real pumpkin in it so i assume there is a mistake in the listing omitting pumpkin. its very quick and easy. this isnt a gourmet product and nothing compares to a home made pie but overall this is not a bad product. if you enjoy the no bake cheesecakes this one should be enjoyable also.
4,A great read with many pithy insights.,"The description on the back of the book calls Anne Matthew's look at higher education ""affectionate,"" but I would say ""acerbic"" is more accurate. In fluid prose she relates incidents and vignettes which illustrate the contradictions and inconsistencies of higher education today, leaving the reader with a sense of the waste, irresponsibility, and hypocrisy endemic to the enterprise. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
1,Another Cheap Product From Playhut,"Buyer beware on all Playhut products online that don't specifically tell you what the material is! They used to promote the nylon they used and made sure it was in each product description. Now they don't even tell what the product is made from because they are using plastic and ""paper like"" materials and selling them for the same price as durable NYLON. augh! I can wash my old Playhut things easily. They air dry and can be used for years. Try getting this junk wet and a finger could easy go right through it. The same warning goes for buying Playhut in the stores. Make sure you open it and SEE what it is made out of before you buy it. Playhut should be ashamed of what they are doing to their reputation. Cutting corners to add to their profits is losing customers who didn't mind paying more for quality but they refuse to pay more for trash!"
3,"daughter loved it ,to bad it's made so cheap","my daughter loved it ,she only 18 mo. old ,to bad it is made so cheap that i had to return it, the seaming was coming undone and it is made of a cheap paper like materal and my daughter has a cat so hahaha can you imagine cat claws paper like materal if i would have kept it i'am sure it would have been ripped to ribbons..and i thought it would have been bigger.. very small .over-all i would not have bought knowing that it was made so cheaply"
5,The classic I remember,It was wonderful to be able to read it to my child. Hopefully one day when I'm old and gray it will still be around to read to my grandchildren
5,another classic,"I love the children books that have the ""norman rockwell/ eloise wilkins"" feel. This is beautifully illustrated and has large pictures on each page as well as the classic story of the ""NBC"""
1,Dull illustrations,"I understand the everything Santa does, happens at night, but I don't think a children's book should be illustrated that way. There is very little color in this book. After reading this one to our daughter for three years, we are in search of a new, more colorful and expressively illustrated version of this classic story."
1,Lackluster illustrations,"Only a few of the pages in this book have color illustrations, and some of those don't hold the attention of a young child. A large number of two-page spreads had only a very small black and white pen sketch on each page. I'm suprised at reviews that rave about the illustrations. We were disappointed enough to return this."
5,Loved it,I loved the illustrations. My mom use to recite this to me as a child from memory. My main reason for purchasing this book is to have a copy of the original classic with the part of St. Nick and pipe.
4,Mixed feelings,"I own several copies of this classic poem, and this little book both compells me and disturbs me. The father who tells the story meets Santa, who presents him with a miniature cowboy, obviously something he had wanted as a boy. The father's story is shown to be very cute. What stands out, of course, are the illustrations. They are dramatic in the artist's sharp use of perspective and close-ups, the reindeer looking spirited and excited. I must admit to being a little bothered by at least two of the pictures of Santa, which give him a kind of lunatic, wild-eyed glare. The eyes just look a little too manic. On the whole I like it, but still prefer my copy from my own childhood, which is still with me after all these many years."
2,Disappointed,"I'd have to agree with other reviews about this book that were less than positive. Yes, the story is all there... but, you'd think with a nice cover - it would have more pictures. Most of the pages are just words which isn't very fun for a toddler to look at. And, the pages that do have pictures are kind of dark and a little blurry. It's not terrible - but, it certainly could have been a lot better. I was disappointed."
2,A board book that's not for toddlers?,"I usually assume that if something is available as a board book it will be geared toward infants and toddlers. However, my two year old son (who is very excited about Santa this year) cannot sit through more than a page or two of this. There are hardly any illustrations, and the few that are there are very dark and hard for him to make out. It is clearly designed for an older child with a longer attention span, so I am left wondering why it was made as a board book. And truthfully, even with the attention span to listen to the story without any pictures, why would you want to? There are so many other beautifully illustrated versions of this book. I would not not recommend settling for this one."
2,Creepy Santa,"The illustrations in this book are generally good, but the big man himself looks downright scary. Our kids are so bothered by the ""creepy Santa"" that we have to cover up his face on a couple of the pages. Buy a different version of this book!"
2,"Bad pictures, we were really disappointed.","Love the board book, size, and of course the classic story. But the pictures are very dark and muted. My 2 year old LOVES to read and yet the pictures were so drab it couldn't hold his attention for more than a page or two. I was very excited to share this story with him so I was disappointed when he had no interest."
3,Abridged? Seriously?,"Great illustrations, but this version completely omits the part about the smoke from his pipe encircling his head like a wreath (because I'm sure kids start smoking because of this) and how his belly shakes like a bowl full of jelly (the root cause of childhood obesity?) Get real! It's a classic! Respect the author!"
5,The Night Before Christmas (A Big Golden BooK),"I have had one of these books since the birth of my first child, which was inscribed to her. We read from it every Christmas Eve. Recently my second child indicated she wanted her own copy of this version. It took awhile to find it, but I am very pleased with the copy I got."
5,Perfect illustrations for book content.,This was exactly what I was hoping for. The illustratons fitperfectly with the content. Some fold-out pages were a nicesurprise.
2,Not for toddlers,"After reading my two-year-old daughter this book, I was heartbroken to hear her say, ""I no like Santa."" She asked me to never read it again because she thought the characters and the reindeer were scary. I don't blame her. The reindeer are wild-eyed and this version of Santa has a glimmer in his eye that's more mischievous than joyful. He's actually creepy in some of the spreads. This Santa looks like he's breaking and entering when he's about to go down a chimney. I'm not kidding! The illustrations also have a side story that's unrelated to the verse -- something about a gift for the father from his childhood or something? Anyway, if I could do it over, I would have spent more for a book featuring that jovial, friendly Santa that I've come to associate with Christmas. Please learn from my $6.99 mistake."
5,Beautiful Classic!,I searched and searched for a classic version of this story for our Grand Daughter's first Christmas. And...of course I found it on Amazon. It is such a beautiful book...gorgeous illustrations and fold out pages for panoramic scenes. Our baby was just enthralled.
5,True Classic,"This is my second copy of this particular version. It's a large book with that ""old fashioned"" look. It also is the original poem with ""Donder and Blitzen,"" not the ridiculous Donner which has become popular and has no meaning. Donder means thunder in German -- hence Thunder and Lightening. With it's hard cover, beautiful artwork, and classic text, this is the type of book to pass down through generations."
5,beautiful book,This book is beautifully illustrated. I bought for a friend of mine who lost hers in a flood. Shel loved it! The kids enjoyed it. It looks like an antique copy.
1,T. Tudor's illustrations are overlayed with frames...cutting out details,"I was very disappointed with this edition. The publisher overlayed Tasha Tudor's beautiful illustrations with frames that cut out a lot of fun details, like the little mousy apartment below floor level. I hope that whichever publishing house has the rights to this book will go back to the original format in future prints."
4,Good,Nice book for young children. Will read it for a Christmas tradition. Ilustrations a little complicated for the young ones.
2,This is not the poem I know,What the description doesn't tell you is that this is an abbreviated version of The Night Before Christmas. Close to half the original lines have been discarded and what's left makes for a very brief and disappointing read if you are familiar with the classic poem.
4,Great for Infants/Smal Children,"This was a gift for my nephew. It's a great beginners Board Book, but please note the dimensions when you purchase this. It is very small which makes it ideal for infants and toddlers, but if you're expecting a large Board Book, you will be disappointed. Nice illustrations, simplified story versus the orignal, but makes a great gift."
2,Abridged version?,"I was disappointed that several passages of the story seem to be missing. If I had known before, I would not have bought it."
5,Beautiful version of the classic book!,"I bought this book for my daughter's first Christmas.This was a fantastic purchase! It is beautifully illustrated and is on high quality paper. While my daughter wasn't so interested this year, next year I expect to get more use out of it.Also, this is a large book and would look nice on a coffee table, bookshelf, or as part of a decorative display."
5,Great illustrations,The poem is legendary of course but what my children (3 and 6) love is how Tasha Tudor brings the story to life. Every drawing has so many things going on that they find new ones every time we read it. By far their favorite Chistmas book.
3,Bad DVD Compiling,First this was not in a box set but shipped as five seperate discs but the worst thing is these discs have no menu and getting to the second episode on the discs makes you forward threw the disc were both episodes cross on one track.Great content but horrible DVD compiling by the manufacturer. Just record it on Discovery Channel and save your money.
2,A fairly boring episode of a good show,"The 'thing' that is covered in this episode doesn't actually exist (and there is no serious plan to build it). If you're interested in watching the same few clips of computer animation played over and over again, go ahead and buy it!"
5,"For all Cobbs, white or black","I saw this play performed in a small theater in Chautauqua, New York last summer, and loved it so much I immediately bought the play and read it again. This is the phenomenal psuedo-documentary play of one of America's greatest renowned baseball heros--Ty Cobb. Taking place in a hub-world of sorts, a transitory incorporeal stadium between the waking life and whatever hereafter may be, Cobb quarrels with not only three different images of himself, but the real-life character--one Oscar Charleston--who exposes what kind of man Ty Cobb really was."
5,When you find yourself in times of trouble....,"The truly amazing thing about this work is that it was written in PRISON as Boethius awaited execution (following judgment and conviction based upon spurious charges). Bearing that in mind as I read ""The Consolation of Philosophy"" (if anyone ever needed consolation, it was an innocent man awaiting his own death; Christians should be able to relate to that idea) made it all the more remarkable. If you ever feel that life isn't fair, that others have it ""in"" for you, that it's tough to get an even break, maybe reading this will put things in better perspective. If not, it won't be due to Boethius' shortcomings...."
2,Only for the Seafaring!,"Poolman takes what could have been a fascinating, exciting story and makes it into a dull read. His insistence on stressing the (mostly nonexistent) positive qualities of the captain make it seem as though he has an axe to grind in supporting Shelvocke. Fortunately, it's short!"
4,Works perfectly with my 2004 4Runner.,"I bought this kit to swap out my factory non-JBL head unit with a single din head unit. It fits great using the existing bolts and their locations. It looks great after the install. I took away one star because the instructions provided are very brief and require a little more experience than for a novice installer. Also, I noticed the multi-information display was sticking out when replacing everything. With the kit adding a ""spacer"", the bottom bolts were sticking out further than normal. I removed the bolts, so that the multi-information display would sit flush again. Everything still felt solid and didn't notice any vibration when driving around. I will eventually try to replace the bolts with ones with shorter heads, just because it bothers me that they are missing..."
4,Rhymes cuneiform with uniform,"I had not read any Amazon reviews before buying this, but my reference points were Joy Division meets the Liars for the vocals, and a stripped-down PIL-Neubaten meets a more industrialized The Fall, if only for the latter's repetition. The standout tracks were Black Forest II and III, U-Boat, and Death Train, but the whole effort, packing a lot of variety into a few minutes. The primitive, clanking, robotic nature of this band makes for a love-hate relationship, but if you like the forebears and current-bears of this reconstruction of various proto- and post-punk 70s sounds, this is an excellent primer.Like others, I have not been able to find out about this band's earlier two albums; perhaps SubPop will re-release them? With the support of a ""major-indie"" (sic) label, a fan base awaits, as many of us are finding out about this band only now due to the exposure given this record. Honorable mention: credited band members: Emphysema, Ricketts, and Cholera."
3,Turn it up,"Black Forest is the first and only A Frames record i've heard. According to the other reviews posted here, the first two records are definetly worth checking out. The A Frames style sounds best turned up on a stereo and even though i really dig the music, the lyrics are irritating and the structure of the songs rarely changes throughout the record....instrumental verse as intro, drop out the music add vocals, finish verse, blast through the intro again. it sort of reminds me of Wire at times, but i wouldn't diss Wire like that. I don't know, i'm on the fence with this one a bit, buy it used or something to get your moneys worth"
2,Very meh,"I bought these boots to work with a Jedi costume I was making on a budgeted price. The boots looked great, and for the 1st costume run (which was standing and photos and minimal walking) they worked. I then wore these to a Convention in costume and not an hour in just walking on normal pavement or floors inside, the soles completely ripped off and came unglued. We've tried a few glues, and none are really holding it in place. I'm not pleased that the one thing they are made for they cant accomplish. I understand they aren't real boots and I don't expect them to do real boot things, but mild walking on level solid ground with nothing more crazy than walking and generic poses for pics in them, and they fell apart. I do not recommend these for anyone making a costume they intend to do ANY walking in, because these boots are GOING to fall apart and be more of a hassle than they are worth."
5,Best comedy in a long time,"You guys are nuts. This movie was amazing, absolutely brutally hilarious and original. If yore conservative, I don't recommend it because you don't have a sense of humour. My family and I laughed nonstop at this raunchy film. The acting was amazing, and real. Even better, the actors/producers/directors/writers are awesome and friendly, actually called and talked to them! Such an amazing film for a next to no budget movie, watch it. At least rent it, it's out on redbox now. Props to you guys!"
2,Nowhere near as funny as it wants to be,"2.3 starsThis is indeed a decent effort for the young age of the filmmakers, but it's still not very good. The script has moments but is often pointlessly crude just for shock value, the acting is weak all around, and the plot goes all over the place for no special reason.The camera is moved well and there's hints of quality to come from the writer/director/star in some scenes, but he ain't there yet and this got boring far too fast for a film just trying to be fun. Too serious to be fun at points and too stupid to be serious when it wants to be, Bindlestiff just feels like a film school project that somehow got released on dvd when it should be on youtube.Kevin Smith owes us a couple bucks. He might think crude and lewd is enough to make a flick work, but it ain't. Won't be trusting his ""taste"" in films again."
1,Garbagola,"I'm going to stay away from anything with Kevin Smith's name on it. Brainless. Sold out to the Devil? Whatever, it's a sad thing. ""We all have the right to be wrong now and then."" So get with it and grow up a little. Quit bashing Christians. It's so idiotic. People like this have no clue. Just spoiled and squandering the freedom those old-fashioned Christians worked hard and died for.BTW: Movie is just a waste of time and money, esp. the tedious introduction by the pretentious K Smith. Boring.I rented this from Redbox.Don't buy this unless you're one of the kids that made it. If you're one of their parents, no."
4,Not exactly enjoyable,"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show was my favorite show when it was on (it stopped airing in the summer of 1997). This episode is a good one to watch over and over. Unfortunately, it isn't closed-captioned."
5,"As good an album as there is, in any genre","I challenge anyone who says ""I like all music, except country"" to not come away smiling after their first listen, and singing along after the 2nd or 3rd.""Red Headed Stranger"" is as good an album as ""Let It Bleed"", ""Revolver"" or ""Daydream Nation"" (Stones, Beatles, Sonic Youth, respectively). Everyone needs to own it."
5,Americana & Willie Nelson,"An excellent recording - clearly one of Willie's best, and one to recommend to people who have only heard the ""commercial"" Willie Nelson.The playing is magnificent, which is Willie's trademark, and the small scale of the ensemble makes it a closer, more intimate experience. One should note that Willie can't claim credit for all the music: the tune to ""Can I sleep in Your Arms"" is really ""Red River Valley"" and ""Hands on the Wheel"" is ""The Tennessee Waltz."" Despite the familiar tunes, Willie still makes them work with the alternative lyrics, plus there's the fact you can sing duet with Willie with the original words, if you like."
4,Great,"Great record, and ""Hands on the Wheel"" is sheer beauty. ""Bonaparte's Retreat"" is wonderful as well."
4,Classical Greatness,"I think Willie is a great singer but he has never been a personal favorite. This album, though, is among my favorites. In it, he demonstrates his skills as a lyricist, he mellow voice and his ability to narrate a song.Much of this work sound like it could come right from out of the old west. This differentiates it from much of country music which is simply rural but modern. There are exception but the feeling of timelessness. These tunes and songs have a ""classic"" style. They are wonderful.This is an old album. I used to have the 8 track. It is still worth it."
5,AMAZING Concept Album,"WOW.This album really exists in a league of its own. Throughout the course of ""Red Headed Stranger,"" we hear Willie at his greatest -- as a lyricist, a guitarist, a singer, and a storyteller.Though I generally get bored with concept-albums, this one shines above every other. This is a disc to play from beginning to end, and enjoy the dusty, tragic ride it takes you on.Listen to it closely and you can smell the whiskey and hear the horses."
5,willies at his very best,a classic tale of the old west life that willie capured in songs. any willie nelson fan should listen and here what started willies singing career and they will understand why he is were he is at today. a must buy.
3,"Its alright, depends on what you're expecting","Not one of my favorites but still an important work for Willie Nelson fans. It is not a flashy studio recording - many of the tracks seem hardly more than Willie and his guitar. Oddly enough, I think I the bonus tracks are the best part of this recording for me. If you are looking for vintage Willie, however, this could be the recording for you."
5,Willie is the best.,"This is the best album Willie has ever done. He is such a good story teller and the instrumentals with his sister, Bobbie, on piano are captivating."
5,REAL COUNTRY!,"It is a shame the absolute trash that they try to pass off as country music today. This is the album where Willie finally said screw you to Nashville and made a real country record. Willie is one of the few Outlaws left, and I if you enjoy good COUNTRY music. This is a great buy."
5,Red Headed Stranger CD,Found the re-mastered CD at Amazon and it took me back thirty years to the old 8-track when I first started to listeneing to Willie Nelson. Ordering was efficient and I received it ahead of schedule. Thanks
4,Willie Spurs Me On,"I have to admit, in my younger ""rock"" years, I had pushed aside Wille Nelsons tremendous talent. Now as I have meandered my way up the road of age & rembrance, ""Red Headed Stranger"", a re-released 1975 album has spurred me on. It is now a time of reflection, of opportunities missed and music once ignored.We get 15 fabulous simplistic tracks that tell a story of the West. Including the two breakthrough hits, ""Remember Me"" and ""Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain"" . Also included on this digitally re-mastered masterpiece are 4 covers.I so thouroughly enjoy this CD, I am convinced, there is a 'lil bit of country in all of us.Thank you for your interest & comments--CDS"
5,If you own one Willie album this should be it.,"This is one of my ""desert island"" albums, I could listen to it over and over agian and alwas find something new to enjoy!"
3,Ok,"It's Ok. We bought a similar product before and couldn't use it because it pressured the baby's chest. This one's much better, because you can adjust it, but it's still not long enough."
4,Quiet Child,"Es útil para viajar con los pequeñines sin que puedan escapar muy lejos.It's practical in order to travel with children, they would not to escape too far with this product."
2,I did not like it!,"Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! LOLMy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. It was really heartbreaking. On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOLWe used it a couple of time and put it aside. She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth."
1,Children are not pets,"I tried to get my 3 year old to use this but she kept saying ""I am not a doggy"". I finally coaxed her to using it with a bag of cookies. While at the mall we received many disgusted looks. One parent called this device ""abusive"" and criticized my parenting. After I thought about it, I realized that many generations have gone by without these leashes and I was indeed being a bad parent. I do not recommend anyone do this to themselves or their child."
1,Not as good,We bought this harness and the Kiddopatamus harness and this one isn't as good. The shoulder straps rub against the kids' necks. There also isn't any padding so the nylon digs in a bit. We wouldn't recommend this product.
3,you might find a better one,"This leash is okay, it does the job but my son hates it. He feels constrained, I think because there are so many straps. It can be a little confusing when you are trying to put it on, especially if you have a little one that doesnt want to wear it. It also doesnt fit snugly, the main strap around the belly rides up and the shoulder straps are flopping around all over. My son is 18 months and is about 26 pounds and even with the straps at their tightest it didn't fit snugly like the picture shows. We happened to be somewhere with another mom who let us borrow another type of 'leash' and it was just a stretchy cord with a hook to attach to a belt buckle or something and that worked much better. It was an 'out of sight, out of mind' thing with my little one, and since it had stretch- it gave him a little more leeway."
5,Does it's job.,"It's cheap, and it does it's job... keeps your child from walking away. Most of the time, not too much of a problem. But when your at a festival or other such place and your toddler does not want to sit in the stroller any more, the LAST thing you want is them being able to wander around to 'anywhere'. Nothing scarier and more easily fixed than with the kid keeper; even if your child doesn't like it all the time, their safe! That is what is most important. And it's easily adjustable so it will fit your growing child. -To any naysayers of the product, either losing your child doesn't scare you or you obviously have not been the parent of a young child!"
1,Stick to sci fi... *shrug*,I found this tome and the previous one in the series to be very poor. The scope of Mays writings just doesn't come out here in the same way as the Mileu series. Perhaps if fantasy books are to your taste this will rate as more pulp but if the story of the Remmilards interested you in this I'd suggest you just re-read intervention! It'll save you a couple of bucks and make a far more rewarding read.
1,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this book. I didn't expect to be wowed, as I wasn't terribly impressed with the first book in the series (Black Trilium) but I expected something worth my time to read. The writing fails to draw me in and the story doesn't hold my interest. I could deal with the writing quality if the story was better, but it just doesn't make me want to turn the page. I also think it maybe a lack of character development, the princesses seem two dimensional.It's the sort of book I would only read when on vacation with little other reading options. I can deal with poor"
5,Stupendous!!(is that how you spell it?),"I didn't read Black Trillium, but I was absolutely blown away by the detail and excitement delivered by this book! Julian May is an exellent fantasy author, enough to make me want to read the whole series!! Double thumbs up!(if this were a movie and I were Siskel & Ebert) - Karli the raptor girl"
2,A Quick Reference Guide for Beginners,"If you are familiar with previous versions of Illustrator, or pretty much any other Adobe Product, then you might want to skip this book. It's a very stripped down user's manual (which I believe is the intention of the authors), and covers only the how... not the why. I would, however, consider it handy if you are used to working with another drawing program, and want to port over to illustrator. For the cost, it serves to be handy as a desktop reference, but would help more from a better shortcut or hot key section."
5,Underrated series with amazing cast and guest starts,"This series only ran for two seasons and, in my opinion, was underrated. Good ensemble series with very recognizable guest stars."
1,horrible unwatchable transfer worst season set I own,save your money and wait for the reviews of the Image entainments release of complete season set in the $30.00 range. I own the Anchor Bay release of Crime Story set and it a crime it was released . Season two Muddy washed out transfer and sub standard audio tracs to boot (like badly rip B5 episodes off the news groups back in the day) and most of the orginal broadcast music was strip out replace my elevator music like the second season of the Fugitive. Buy if you like flushing $60.00+ usd down the toliet . I own this set it a train reck.
5,I'm very happy with this!,I am sold on these puzzles! I plan to get all of them eventually. Fun tool to learn geography in our homeschooling while having fun at the same time.
5,Awesome tool for learning geography,"I don't have kids. I actually bought this one for myself and my wife. We live overseas and don't want to be ""ignorant Americans."" We decided to learn all(?) the countries of the world. This is one of our primary tools for doing it. It's really a great tool for doing that.Honestly, I can't tell you if it'd be a good tool for kids. We'll hold on to them and use them with our kids when we have some, but for now, I can only say it's a great way for adults to learn geography."
5,awesome,The color in the picture is the color it is when you use it. It doesn't chip and crack like other liners tend to do. It goes on smooth and lasts well. ~S
5,chubby pencil,This is a great pencil. I love being able to line my lips right the first time and this pencil does that.
1,There is no color to it.,"Maybe I chose the wrong color, but this is the same as nothing. If you choose to purchase this, choose something darker."
5,Great product for price!,"This color had more of a copper undertone then I expected from the pic & name, but beautiful red for fall/winter.As said doubles as liner/lip color :) and great price!I love that sephora doesn't test on animals, so I am always happy when their products meet my expectations.I would totally buy again in different colors."
5,"I, Mudd & Trouble with Tribbles","Two back to back side-splitting episodes guarenteed to leave you laughing. In ""I, Mudd"", Roger C. Carmel returns at the intergalatic rogue Harry Mudd...the humor never ends, everyone has a blast. (including a fake blast that'll have you rolling on the floor!) ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" introduces the fuzzy little creatures that would become an overnight smash. The grain bin full of Tribbles dumping on Kirk is priceless!"
1,Why Oh Why Did I Buy This Book?,"I like reading about spooky houses were around every darkened cornor is filled with the unexplainable and some unimagined horror and scare. This book just was unbelievable. Yes, it was vivid in imagination, but non-senscial. I was thumbing through the pages to finsih the book. I never got to the end. It was so drawn out and not catching my attention. Needless to say, anyone want a copy? Read this book if you are looking to get away from the mundane for awhile. You will want the mundane to return quickly as you read this book.""Flesh"" is not one of Lees' best."
2,Rehashed,"Here's the problem with Edward Lee's ""Flesh Gothic"": it goes no where. No one cares about the characters, most of whom serve no purpose other than to die. The continuity errors and loose ends abound (consider, if you will, how one character is forced to give his wallet up to a security guard in a mental institution for the safety of the patients, then three pages later the wallet is miraculously back in the character's pocket or how a van that was left in the driveway of a mansion somehow turns up back in its rightful parking place, a phenomenon that is NEVER explained).The good thing about the book: it's descriptive. Sometimes nauseatingly so.Bottom line: read Stephen King for a more intense, less pseudo-metaphysical scare."
4,Super Creepy,If you want a terrific horror writer you found him in Edward Lee. Be forewarned he is demented and grisley and he creates images you won't soon forget.
4,"""That's what Hildreth was pushing: full-tilt,to-the-max satanism.""","This was my first Edward Lee book and before I even finished I had ordered three more.On the night of April 3rd the demented billionaire sicko Reginald Hildreth and some of his equally perverted cronies slaughtered and mutilated a bunch of women in a ritual sacrifice to...well, we don't know yet. After the murder's Reginald's body was never found so his wife has hired the world's leading psychics to stay in the Hildreth Mansion and see what they can find.Bad things start right off the bat including beheadings, sexual organ mutilations, dead body's disappearing, foul language and more demon rapes than UROTSUKIDOJI.I was quite impressed by Lee's perversity and his writing abilities, very refreshing and exciting. I can't wait to read more even though I was disappointed this time by the predictable ending."
4,Good book...adults only,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It was a fast and interesting read. Lee has a great voice. His prose and the high energy of the novel make it difficult to put down. There is a lot of sex and gore, so I would not recommend it for children. But if you like your horror served with extra helpings of sex and violence on the side, Lee is your guy."
3,Lee returns to his roots,"Flesh Gothic is a return to Edward Lee's older work. Very graphic and very violent. It is apparent a lot of research went into the mythology of this book. Whether people enjoy it or not, there is no denying Edward Lee's place in modern horror fiction. He writes what every other writer is scared to put on paper. They stop at an R rating, while he moves past -- way past NC-17. But that's where the praise ends for me. I found the ending rushed and many of the characters were only introduced in order to kill them off. I enjoyed this book, but would recommend City Infernal much more."
3,Typical Edward Lee,"I still haven't decided if I like Edward Lee's novels. The basic ideas in Flesh Gothic seem pretty ""can't miss"" for me - haunted house, occult rituals, demons and demonic possession. But, the story just didn't click 100% for me.There are a couple of reasons why this novel may not have worked for me. I think that after reading a handful of his novels, his other work takes on an air of predictability. This novel is no exception. Also, at times it seems that some of his literary excesses - gore, sex, depravity - almost become boring and tedious. Again, this holds true for Flesh Gothic.On the positive side, Edward Lee is typically not very scary, but there actually were some creepy parts in this story."
2,just too silly,"I really didn't know what to expect with this book as I have never read this author previously. The plot was silly, the characters shallow and the sexual descriptions just plain, well, icky. This is just a haunted house story on viagra. I gave it two stars just for the simple fact that it kept me turning pages (I kept thinking I would eventually find something original or interesting). I guess I'll stick with Shirley Jackson for the best haunted house action."
1,Too much on the on the sex and the demonolgy.,I picked up this book in hopes for a good ghost story and a haunted house. Somewhat that is true. But I'll warn you this book could go a long way to make you really sick.I am not a fan of Mr. Edward Lee. I never want to read anything by him again. The book is filled with too many descriptions of sexual activity and a gerat deal of detail in to demonolgy. To the point of the preverseity. I am not a prude but after reading this book I wanted to spend the rest of my life taking a lot showers and becoming a monk.The thing that really bothers me is to which the detail the author writes some of the demonic sceans. It's is as if he has first hand knowledge of this matter.My suggestion is that if you are fairly good person. Stay away from this book. It willl make you sick. Go back to Stephen King.
1,Ick,"I thought this was crap. It's bloody, and explicit enough that a few decades ago it could have passed as soft core porn. Read something else- anything else."
1,Defective fuel pump. Amazon completely refunded my money!!,I had a problem with the first pump sent it back and the second did the same thing. I contacted Sierra and they said there was a manufacturing problem with this pump and to return and get buy one from a dealer. Sierra was very responsive and apologized for any problems we had.Amazon refunded all of my money including shipping. Amazon is a wonderful company to deal with!!!!!
5,Revealing and insightful insider's account.,"As a reality-check, this should be considered a must-read by any aspiring songwriter, musician or singer before embarking on the pitted road to Nashville. Through incredible insight, research and experience, Mr. Daley illuminates the good, the bad and the eccentricity of the business of country music. His engaging style captures the tone of the laid-back, but unique, methodologies of the movers and shakers of the Nashville Community."
3,Shipping Inaccurate,"This item is never in stock. It may show that you can order it online - but in green, as well as in blue - it is not in stock. I ordered this 2 months ago and have not received it. Four months before that I ordered the blue one...it never shipped and then was discontinued....Amazon gave me my money back. Beware if you are buying this for a gift."
1,Not what you think...choose something else !,"The word 'green' is in the title. Foolishly I looked at the traditional twine color in the photograph and assumed green referred to the fact that's it's biodegradable, natural, 'green.' The photograph needs to be changed. I wholly wasted $5, and the portrayal of this item reflects terribly against Amazon altogether."
2,odor / smell,Item arrived with case and foam handle smelling of gasoline and motor oil - had to throw case away - odor on foam handle still present after one week - you can even feel in on your hand after use
1,Same as Targus TG-MP6710 -:(,"This item looks & feels exactly like Targus Digital TG-MP6710 67-Inch Camera/Camcorder Monopod, selling $12 @Amazon, I paid $8 (66.7%) more for a carrying bag & a different brand -:(."
4,Does the trick,Lightweight and easy to use. Foot has a point for outside but the point can be retracted to save the inside floors.
4,good value,"There is a 1 star review which I think may be for a wrong product. This one is durable, not wobbly at all. The screw for the camera/corder is quite sturdy. The retractable metal tip is great. The clasp for each section is also very tight (they won't retract back in when you push it or have a heavy camera on it).The included case also fits snuggly. I got it here at Amazon in the Today's Deals for a good price.I know for sure in the stores something compatible, aluminum, would cost about $30.With Amazon Prime, and no sales tax, it's a great bargain.I only wish it had somekind of base-mount for camera so I can adjust the angles for camcorders. I have a small Sanyo Xacti camcorder. It fits so nicely on this monopod. Even in a crowd, I can raise this high and shoot over people's heads.It doesn't have extra features, but for what it's made to do, it is great.Thumbs up buy!"
5,Simple monopod lives up to expectations--from a buyer,"--When planted, the monopod is firm, even when at its greatest height (which is higher than I would need). It is lightweight and easy to put or carry the camera upon. I have several cameras, and anticipated that it would be easier to use the monopod with the cameras that have optical viewfinders where the viewfinders can be pressed close to my eye. The ones with only a display screen, for which I prefer a tripod, I have to hold a bit away from my face to see the screens, and this introduces a little shake on my part."
3,"Some good stuff, some so-so","This CD has a good selection of material from the French repertoire. The organ sounds good, and the playing and registrations are pleasing, for the most part. There are a couple of downsides to this CD, though. The liner notes state that the organ was recorded without the use of compression. While this may yield a more authentic dynamic range, it does mean that the quiet passages are really quiet. My other gripe is that Gordon Turk's playing on the toccatas sounds slow, plodding, and mechanical. Maybe the playing on these particular pieces is technically correct, but there's not a lot of life to them. Overall, though, it's a good CD to listen to as long as all is quiet around you."
5,i LOVE the wedding,"omy, i absolutley love these guys. i first saw them at a concert in wisconsin, and i didn't know one single word at it. i loved them live, so i bought there cd and i have become, how would you say it, obsessed (?) with the music. i now know every word to every song :) i don't have a song that i don't like on the cd, but i like Price for Love, One Eye Open, But a Breath, Water under the bridge, Joyride, and Song for the Broken the best. check them out...NOW. :D"
3,Confusing and kind of boring,"To be honest this book was hard for me to read. I don't know why, but my attention kept slipping away. I think the style this is written in is a little textbook like with very little emotion.It is nice to learn more about Joan of Arc, but this book has no feeling to it. I had no sense of Joan's divine mission or purpose, and there was no real conflict with those around her. I would have loved to hear more about the Duke that fell in love with Joan, but it just wasn't there.And the whole reincarnation thing was just odd. I mean, it was sort of implied that Joan was and would be reincarnated but never really stated.Also, considering that Joan believed god wanted France for the French, maybe the book should have explained why god was against the English. It would have helped me a lot. And then the title would have made sense.So, three stars. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible, but I can't say I'd recommend it."
2,"Not bad, but lacks something","The research is excellent, discounting a few glaring historical inaccuracies where the author decided to take liberties with the facts...otherwise this is strictly casual reading. Do not expect to become enthralled by the storytelling, which is lacking in polish and spirit; or the characters, which are for the most part flat and stereotypical. Marcantel does little to make her work stand out from the countless other renditions of Joan's story; she might have done better to write An Army of Angels with a little more experience behind her, than attempting it as a first novel."
2,For Children 13 and Under,"The story of Joan d'Arc is one told many times, and ""An Army of Angels"" was a dissapointing version. The first few chapters were captivating, but the conversation with the angels grew tiresome, and midway, I could barely get through the book. Marcantel, who is said to work in the English Department at the University of Virginia, sadly lacks the advanced vocabulary a woman of her stature should have. Despite the fact that the extent of her research is evident, perhaps she should have spent more time using a thesaurus so that the text would be more rich and challenging. This goes to show that one should never judge a book by its cover, and ""An Army of Angels"" comes short of my expectations. Better to be categorised in the ""Youth"" section where the amateur grammar and sentence structure is more appropriately suited."
3,"Great book, but a little slow at times","A good historical aspect of the heroine we call Joan of Arc. A good beginning and a solid end that will bring tears to your eyes. However, the middle gets a bit slow. Other than that I would reccomend it if you don't mind dedicating yourself to a rather lengthy book"
2,Visor mounted microphone falls short,"I had great expectations for this hands-free car kit, but the microphone is unreliable. The speaker comes on loud and clear, but microphone works sporadically. I'm going to have to take it back. Perhaps it's a fluke. Additionally, I want to have my phone with me all the time so previously bought the leather, glove-fit carrying case with swivel belt clip, but the hands-free holder doesn't allow room to fit the phone with the case on. I jump in and out of the car frequently so don't want to mess with putting/taking the leather carrying case on/off all the time, consequently I can't use the hands-free holder. I think they could have designed it a tad wider with a stronger gripping mechanism and then accommodated the leather carrying case as well."
5,LOVELY CUBAN BOLEROS AND MAMBOS,"This music will be nostalgic for any American who grew up watching Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy."" I loved this CD so much that I bought four copies and doled them out for Christmas presents. These Cuban boleros and mambos are incredibly danceable and singable."
3,ignor review,Dont even remember this item. Doing this as I can not find any other way to get it off my list
1,Dangerous!,Two year old put it I her head to wear like a cowgirl hat and it slipped down to be stuck on her neck- took 55 minutes to cut it off - item ought to be pulled off market. Incident could've been a lot worse had the toddler not been supervised at the time...
1,TERRIBLE for boys,"This is a TERRIBLE potty for little boys (I have it in blue). The splash guard is a joke, but we have taught our boys to ""point it down"" which they have gotten quite good at. However, even though they are aiming down, somehow the pee never fails to leak out of the potty onto the floor. I think it leaks out underneath the seat and above the top of the little removable pot. I really can't figure out how it happens but pee gets EVERWHERE. I'm tempted to throw this one away."
4,Good for kids who are small for their age,"This potty is very low to the ground. Perfect for kids who are small for their age. My kid had trouble climbing onto other potties, but this one is the shortest on the market."
1,Not good for boys,I bought the blue one for my boy. The potty hole is so tiny even for a tiny butt and the splash guard is useless.. I tried to put the toilet trainer on our toilet seat .. It did not fit at all.
1,Aweful product,"To date I have purchased two of these pottys for my son's training (the blue ones). One for my place, and one for the sitters. It was only discovered shortly after using that there are holes in the bottom of the pan (where the waste is received) in each potty! I thought, well if it was for one, maybe a manufacturing defect, but both. When I contacted the company about it, their suggestion was for me to pack them both up and send them both back in order for them to send me new ones. I asked them what I was to do without pottys and they said it was not their problem. Great customer service skills.Each and every time my son uses the pottys, it leaves a large mess on the floor since urine also escapes up around the upper lip of the potty. Maybe it's not a problem for girls, but it certainly does not hold up for the boys.Biggest waste of money!!!!!"
2,value vs practicality & quality,"I have a cushioned toilet seat for my son at home which I prefer not to take along with me whenever we visit someone's house. It is too cumbersome and I don't want to misplace it. So I bought this potty as a spare because it was just $9.99 and qualified for free shipping. The seat can be used on top of the regular toilet and it converts to a step stool. However, the opening is small and it is made out of hard plastic. I have not used this once ever since I bought the Fisher Price potty-on-the-go which surpasses my expectation--design, durability, portability and level of comfort."
3,Boring,my daughter is 21 months and she love to go potty but this i must admit sure doesnt encourage her to go at all looks comfy though and durable as well
5,Just right for my twins!!,I was looking for a nice little potty that's not too expensive and not to mention it fits just perfect for my girls. Couldn't be happier with the product.
4,Great product!!,I bought this trainer for my 2 yr old daughter and she liked it a lot. You can also use it as a stool.
3,Good for the price,"Got this because my first choice was on backorder, so now I have two, which I figured wasn't a bad thing. This is a good, basic potty at a great price, but there are a couple limitations: 1) the seat snaps in rather than just sitting on top. My daughter can't really decide whether she wants to go in the potty or use the seat on the big people toilet. Making the switch takes a little longer than it should because the seat snaps in/out, and she can't do it herself. 2) the seat sloshes around a bit on the big toilet - no grippers or anything - which makes my daughter nervous. It's a very straightforward design and easy to clean, though."
4,Very basic,"This one is the bare bones version. It is sturdy, easy to use and clean. For the price, you can not go wrong."
4,Summer Infant All-In-One Potty Seat & Step Stool,"My daughter likes this potty (maybe because its pink?) and pushes or pulls it around like its a pet! Very cute. One thing that would make this even better is if there was a handle or some easier way to grip it. Since I have to take it up & down the stairs a lot, it would be helpful if there was an easier way to hold onto it. Otherwise we really like it!"
3,Handle easily scratched,I think the pros go with the stainless handled models because there is no plastic to get scratched up. The second time I used this it was scratched up on the handle from being in the sink with other silverware. This is not the same quality as the earlier KitchenAid utensils which cost a bit more.
2,Hard to Learn The Moves!,"I really have enjoyed some of the other workouts in the Dance Off The Inches DVD series, so I thought that I would like this one as well. Not so much!!! I had a lot of trouble learning the moves. By the time I was getting the hang of them in Tempo 1, the instructor would switch really fast to Tempo 2 and then to Tempo 3. The three Tempo concept is cool (it's what piqued my interst in the first place), but I don't feel like Julianne Arney gives enough instruction on the moves. Now I am not a dancer, just an overweight housewife trying to get in shape, but I have never had this much trouble keeping up with an exercise DVD. If I can't do the moves, I can't work out, so I probably won't be trying this one again."
4,Dance Off The Inches-Calorie Blasting Party,"It is an energy plus type of video, but if you have two left feet, do not give up. Stick with it and you will see results."
3,A bit too easy!,"The first 2 times I did this video, I thought it moved even a bit slow for me. And after that, I just didn't feel like it was that great of a workout anymore since she spends way too much time at the slowest tempo and teaching. I understand you have to slow down and teach initially but after the first viewing, it's so simple that I really didn't even break a sweat anymore. I do like the teacher - she seems very down to earth and the other dancers were not annoying at all!"
2,Beginner workout,I've come to the conclusion that so called Dance workouts are just walking workouts with some extra footwork. The entire Dance Off the Inches series is geared towards either beginners or overweight people. In no way is this a real workout for the already fit exerciser.
1,No Party Here,I bought this video after having read a review in a magazine about it being a great workout. I work out everyday with videos. I was excited to get this video since I love to dance and figured it would make my working out more enjoyable. NOT TRUE. I did this workout maybe 2 or 3 times before I had enough. For the money I paid I was so disappointed. At this point because I was so unhappy with this video I have shyed away from buying any other dance videos. I did own the NYC Ballet and that is still one of my favorites so I will stick with something like that. I have tried to get into this one a few times and within thr first 10 mins I have lost all my interest. Now it just sits there collecting dust.
3,Good workout but boring...,"What I like about the workout is that it is easy to follow. The instructor breaks it down slowly first then do the moves up-tempo. It provides a decent workout for beginners.On the downside, the workout must be targeted toward an older crowd because the decor/outfits/and routine are just uninspiring. I just could not bring myself to do it again."
2,Much the same,"I have been looking for something to help me get started on a regular exercise routine. So, I checked out this DVD from my local library and I am so glad I didn't buy it first.I thought this video would be very different from all the rest, but it just reminded me of a slightly updated version of the old Kathy Smith dance video, but at breakneck speed. I would rather learn dance than jazzercise. Sorry.I didn't even finish the first work out. I recommend you try it before you buy."
2,Too Fast!,"I purchased this DVD because it boasts that even a person with two left feet can do it. Well, I've tried and tried, and she just goes TOO fast. I'll stick with Tamilee Webb."
3,Fun but not intense enough,I agree steps not gone over throughly enough at slower tempo. Dance moves when finally learned hardly made me break a sweat. Hard to dance off the inches if doesn't raise heartbeat. Will still do video though as a warmup for Tae-bo. :)
1,Boring!!,"This is my first dance workout DVD. What a disappointment. I guess I was expecting the cha cha and mambo that was advertised on the back. No real dance steps here, just another version of jazzercize. And the music is terrible. Why can't they put real music on these things? I turned off the sound and put on a favorite CD."
2,Lousy customer/tech service here!,"The program does a reasonable job of filtering spam, but the so called ""bouncing"" service is horrible. It freezes up my Microsoft Outlook constantly. Repeated emails to describe my problem sent to their techs have been ignored. I am very disappointed and may end up completely uninstalling this product. Definitely do NOT recommend this if you want a reliable, user-friendly, tech-supported anti-spam device! :-("
1,"Lousy software, lousy service","I bought this software and wish I hadn't. None of the tabs work and my friends, colleagues go to delete. I can't move them back using ""not spam"" or ""add friend"" buttons. Have written four emails to the company for help and received no replies.Avoid this one"
1,Sounds Like a Rip-off of an NSYNC song,"I think that this song, Shake it off, is terrible! First of all, it sounds like a rip-off of an NSYNC song, but much, much worse. The vocals are weak, but their voices are okay, though they need some training (a lot of training). They should listen to some real songs, then sing their own. Don't waste your money!"
1,Awful at any price,"One star is too high a rating for this production of Taming of the Shrew. It was so campy and cheap that it was a torture to watch. I wanted to throw something at the screen everytime Grumio mugged directly into the camera lens. The tinny and repetitive synthesized music is also extremely grating on the nerves. The cover literature of this cheaply packaged disc makes a point of stating that ""English accents... are absent from this series"" in order to achieve ""clarity of both language and story."" Translate this as: ""Dumbed-down for North Americans."" I'm insulted! This disc is awful at any price."
2,Not worth the video it is recorded on,"There are several versions of ""Taming of the Shrew"" floating around out there. Each with its strong points. Howard Keel's is the closest to the original. Richard Burton is the most flamboyant and fun. But this animal has no social redeeming value and lacks any memorable actors.This film counts on camp to distract from the bad acting and pore timing. It is worse than a high school play. Karen Austin as Katherina is more sex than shrew. Everyone else is just duffus.The Taming of the ShrewKiss Me Kate"
2,Pinnacle Studio 10,I installed the Microsoft Suite 2006 and then the Pinnacle Studio 10.The pinnacle Studio 10 caused my computer to crash. I then had to replaced EVERYTHING on my computer. I lost all my photos.
2,Not that great. Pretty good if mixed with a can of regular.,"I was expecting this to be like the regular Amy's Medium Chili, just less sodium. Doesn't seem to be the case. I love the regular, but this was really bland and tried ""recovering"" it with salt, then pepper, then hot sauce. No go. I couldn't recover anything like the regular. Since we don't have issues with blood pressure anyway, we're sticking with the salted version!Edit: 2/6/13: Since we had a case of the stuff, we discovered that mixing one can of this with one case of regular Amy's Medium Chili does the trick. Tastes nearly as good as the regular product.We mainly use this to make tamale pie, so it works out pretty well mixing the two."
1,Disappointed,"I enjoy many of Amy's Organic products so when I purchased this I assumed I'd like it.I had planned to use this as a base and later add in more ingredients. But after opening the can, emptying it into a pot to shimmer, and sampling it I changed my mind. Ick! The grated tofu (I assume it is the tofu adding the grittiness to the chili, anyway) is very unpleasant. It didn't taste like tofu, or anything really.. It just felt tough and like plastic. The texture it added was not enjoyable at all.The flavor wasn't anything to rave about either. It was alright, but I couldn't get past how gross that grit was so I wasn't able to eat much of it.In the future I won't take short cuts... I'll just make my own chili from scratch."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!,"Although the front of the package looks nice and creamy when you open the box you will be in for a sweet surprise/shock when you find that there is no .25 cent pack of dressing to go with the pasta and parmesan cheese. Unfortunately for you, you will have just paid 1-2 dollars for 6 ounces of pasta noodles and enough parmesan to sprinkle on those now dry noodles. Kraft would of course like you to now buy that 3 dollar bottle of dressing that is needed, but until you do, congratulations on your useless overpriced box of Kraft pasta you just bought.........."
1,Terrible Product,I purchased this product for my husband and it was terrible. He could not stand the flavor. I tried to return it to the seller and they would not accept my return since I had opened the package.
4,Scary,"I am 75 years old and my pastime is reading. I go through four or five novels per week; most of these I have forgotten by the next month. However when I saw this book advertised I instantly remembered it although I read it when it first came out, well over 25 years ago. It was absolutely the most terrifying book I have ever encountered. If you want a good scare for a winter's night this book is it."
2,Bedtime Lullaby,"Even when I sat down to read this book while I was still wide awake, The Unredeemed Captive never failed to put me asleep. This book seems well researched with the potential to be an excellent story. However, the details overwhelmed me and caused confusion instead of clarification. According to his introduction, Demos supposedly attempts to make a transition between purely fact based history and historically fiction. He fooled me. Had I not read his introduction, I would have thought this book was the result of an extensive research paper regarding a specific captive. The basic outline of the book seems interesting, and I was even excited after reading the sypnosis. However, Demos fails to make a connection with the reader."
2,Historically accurate but Dull as hell....,"Normally, the genre of historical fiction is a very interesting read. However, in this book, it is, for lack of a better term, quite boring. If you're looking for a breezy read, this isn't the book you want. If you're looking for accuracy and a story that may be better in movie form, here's your screenplay. Demos' format of breaking up the flow of the book with actual quotes, manuscripts, and other correspondence really takes away from what could be an interesting and quite intriguing story of an upscale colonial Massachusetts family torn apart when a daughter is not ""redeemed"" from her savage captors and in fact assimilates their culture. Good story...Bad reading."
3,Good Early American History,"This is an insightful and educational book about the early Puritan society as they struggle for identity in America. Their biggest obstacles include French Catholics and Native Americans. While this book has a place on scholarly bookshelves, it is not my cup of tea."
3,The Unredeemed captive,"I had to read this book for a college course, i really have never finished a book before but i finished this one. It was intersting and easy to get into it start to take you in circle toward the middle. but i was a good story but kinda written funny. but if you like history you'll like this book alot"
1,Dull,I had to read this book for school and I found it hard to get through. It was dull and the language was incredibly different. It was harder to read and understand than many of my other college textbooks.
1,Misinformation multiplied,"This is, without doubt, one of the worst books I have ever read. It has been several years since I finished it, so I am sorry that I cannot cite specific examples in this review. In general, I found it to be full of unsupported conclusions, vast misunderstandings of the Colonials involved, and almost entirely misleading. That it is still in print, and recommeded by many, is a testament to the paucity of knowledge of this imporant period in our history."
4,What? No Statistics?,"I found this book in my husband's library while we were moving and I quite enjoyed it. I've read John Demos' work before and have always found him to be an interesting historian -- although he has a tendency to get carried away into statistics too much. This book very much surprised me because, except for one place, he didn't get involved in his usual statistical analysis of the situation. Very much enjoyed!"
4,Very interesting narrative on Indian/Puritan relations during early American history.,"We tend to see the relationships between European settlers and the Native Americans is very stark terms, without ever considering the subtlety that must have been a fact of life for those who lived in that era. This book brings those relationships alive."
5,Captive,I bought it for my Kindle. I like the details of the feelings of these early settlers. My interest is great since one of my ancestors was the Hicks family.
2,Eh,Not really what I expected. Quotes here and there but not a lot of information. Looking for something more like365 Goddess: A Daily Guide to the Magic and Inspiration of the Goddess
3,It's fun when you want to play something different,"It's not entirely addicting for me, but it's fun to see what develops among the sims. I'd recommend to those who like playing house with digital dolls and controlling their lives."
4,Always fun,"The Sims is always a fun time waster, I never did warm up to the Sims 3, so I continue to pimp out the Sims 2 and this pack added a lot of fun to a game I've had for over a decade."
4,Fun but glitchy,"This game is fun but it takes forever to go to nightclubs.however the cars,vamps, and clothes r cool.another thing is tht if u want to download something from modthesims.com such as a car u can do tht cuz u have nightlife.this was fun 4 me but i didnt enjoy building nightclubs cuz it takes a long time.**Warning** IF UR SIMS A VAMP DONT LET THEM GO TO SCHOOL CUZ WHEN THEY GET OFF THE BUS THEY WILL DIE IN THE SUN!!!**warning** I HAVE A MAC SO I DIDNT NEED A PATCH SO BEWARE WINDOW OWNERS"
3,Nightlife?,"Honestly- the first expansion pack, Sims 2 University, is definately worth the money, because they can go to college! But, Sims 2 Nightlife- is this really worth buying?<br />The game just says how you can choose what your Sims do, but to me that doesn't sound like much of an expansion pack. If Nightlife has more objects to add, than it might be worth the money."
3,"Nice addition, but...","Overall, this game is pretty fun. However, unlike university (the other ep that I own) there is no major addition to the gameplay. There is more stuff you can do, but nothing as major as college. Also, because the game is really based around community lots, if you have a slow computer, it will take forever to load them every time you want to go out. The last thing I don't like is the ReNuYuSenso Orb(lets you change your aspiration, turn ons and turn offs.) It only costs 6500 Aspiration points. It justs seems way to easy to use. Your aspiration should be harder to change.There's still a lot of good stuff, though. Vampires, chemistry, turn ons and turn offs, and real dates are really cool. I reccomend this game to a die-hard sims fam with a fast computer."
5,Great.,I love it! I can sit here for hours on end and play this game. I swear its addictive. New areas for game play new features.. Just try not to let your Sims get bit by the vampires. Lol.
3,"Good Game, But Crashes for No Reason","We have a DELL XPS 3.8 GHz with a Radeon X800XT graphics card and 2GB of DDR2 memory and Nighlife keeps crashing. Sometimes, I'm not able to save, other times I can't enter downtown, or my people just disappear. I love the Sims2, so I'm very disappointed that it keeps crashing. What's really frustrating is that I know other people having the same issue and EA has no resolution. They keep saying the computer isn't strong enough to run the game and as you can tell my my specs above that's clearly not the issue. Plus, I have all the patches installed for University and original Sims2."
5,The best game ever,"I think this is one of the best expansion packs that the Sims 2 came out with. It was lots of fun. It has bowling alleys, parties, the new socials are good, and the new cltohes that they have are fabulous. I if you're getting an expansion pack for Sims 2 I would definatly suggest this one."
3,CANNOT PLAY GAME!!,"I bought the Sims 2 NL and my computer is not compatible with the game and I very very sad:( I really really want to play this game, I love playing The sims 2 and University, Love it!! I was looking forward to playing this game and I cant:( It is because of my processor speed, even tho the other 2 games play on my computer, this one wont. The only way I can play the game is if I buy a brand new computer!!"
3,Boring Fast,"I just got this game and already it is boring! Much like Sims 2, but a few extra options. I will not be purchasing anymore Sims games. They get old quick. Save your money on this one."
3,Yay,"I just love the Sims & have finally got this EP. Great fun to play, especially with the vampires !"
4,When will it end!!!???,"I do love this game. For some reason controlling small, virtual minds appeals to all levels. I just wish it wasnt 30 - 40 dollars a pop!Theres alot of new things to do and try with this expansion that really livens up the sim world, and I look forward to the new one."
5,This is the Best expansion yet!,"This expansion is definetly worth the money! There are over 150 new objects, cars included! Now you can drop your kids off at school if they miss the bus, and you can drive to work!Now your sims can go out on the town to eat dinner, or dance all night. this is a great game! If you want more info go to www.thesims2.com"
4,Great Expansion pack!,"This expansion pack was one of the ones I really wanted when I heard about it. Some others I was kind of like ""ehh... don't really need that to enjoy the game"" but this one opened up a lot of new doors"
5,Best game ever,Tonight was the first night I had ever played the Sims 2. And I got HOOKED so quickly it's not even funny! This game is amazing and worth every bit of your money! I love it!!!!
1,Disappointment,"I ordered this game, hoping for the individual Nightlife expansion. Instead, they sent me the Deluxe version. I already own all the other expansions, and I cannot install nightlife from the Deluxe version without uninstalling the rest of the games. I'd really like to play Nightlife, but I guess I'm stuck."
4,Sims 2 : Nightlife Expansion Pack,Many don't comprehend the heights of this game...The fun/confusion/appreciation all comes from the mind that controls it.I JUST LOVE IT! Looking forward to the rest.
4,Great game!,I got this game about 2 weeks ago and are so happy about it. There is TONS of new stuff. The best part is the new downtown area were there about 20 new places to go. There are also vampires which are really fun. I must say that this is one of the most addicting games yet!
3,NIght on the Town,"I really enjoy this game. I love the fact that the Sims can have their own cars, but it took me a minute to get how the garage was supposed to go. I also enjoy that their are so many choices when picking a place to go. It is really realistic. Overall I think this is a pretty good expansion pack."
4,Time vacuum,I love the Sim's! I need a lot more time to be able to check out all the new stuff that they can do with Night LIfe. It gives them more stuff to buy to furnish their homes and places to build for them to hang out with other Sims.
5,Best Expansion Pack out there!!!,"The Sims 2 Nightlife is by far the best expansion pack in the Sims 2 franchise. I own all of the expansion packs. And this one is the best. If you are thinking about buying more than here is my rankings of the Sims 2 expansion packs- 1.Nightlife 2.Seasons 3.Pets 4.University 5.Open For Buisness. In Nightlife you can buy cars, go out on dates, go to lots in Downtown such as a Nightclub, a Bowling Alley, A diner, and so much more. Recently, I had trouble with my computer and I could only have one expansion pack, and of course I chose Nightlife. My Advice for the Sims 2 Nightlife is to Buy It!"
3,could not wait!!!!,This coming Christmas....I'll be receiving this game. I know it will be fun! I could not wait to get my hands on this game.But I'll just have to wait! And also watch out for the new coming game The Sims 2 Holiday edition!
4,Great little GPS Receiver,Works well with my BlackBerry 8700c...has the new Sirus III chip...comes with connections for both 110 and 12 volts. Works as advertised.
3,Dead Wood is Great!,"Didn't really know what to expect with this movie, but it is a good watch. People lost in the woods are being absorbed by the tree's around them - one by one."
5,Much better than other products.,"This stuff really works. I got the result that I expected. The directions are simple to follow and the results take a little time, but that's not a problem when a product performs as it's advertised."
2,Weed killer,"I purchased this from Amazon recently hoping to find something better than Roundup. This works on new weeds but on mature ones, ZILCH Guess I""ll stick with Roundup.Elvin. North East Texas."
3,A Good Try,"Jack is a nice easy read but one tends to wonder where Perret got some of his ideas or if in fact he got them from anywhere but his own imagination. There are times when Perret seems to make up small insignificant happenings to forshadow the inevitable outcome of his life. That aside, Jack is a good book portraying a President so unique and so different than most ex-Presidents. This would be a good first Kennedy read."
1,Jack- a life like no other,"I found this book to be an annoying disappointment. Upon reading the book jacket, the author appeared to have the credicials to write an informative and fresh look at the life of our thirty-fifth president. Unfortunately all we get at best is a half hearted attempt at scholarship. At its worse the book reads as an unappealing audition for the editorial staff at the National Inquirer. The book's subtitle is ""A Life Like No Other"", we can only hope that Mr. Perret has ""no other"" future books that handle it's subject in such a fashion."
5,Great!,"Although some people have said some facts in the book are incorrect and they may be, I found JACK to be very entertaining. A great book for someone who wants a single edition Kennedy bio."
2,ZZZZZZZZ,"Mr. Perret somehow succeeded in writing an incredibly boring book about a man who lived an extrodinary life. The book is also marred by continuous misstatements of fact and poor research. To those looking for a good book on JFK, I advise you to take a look at Nigel Hamilton's ""JFK: Reckless Youth"" for illumination on his early life, Richard Reeves' ""Profile in Power"" for a broad look at his presidency, and Arthur Schlessinger Jr.'s ""A Thousand Days"" for an intimate look at his presidency that also gives you an excellent sense of who he was as a person. ""Jack"" isn't worth the time."
1,NOT as described,"This DVD differed from the Amazon listing in three important respects: (A) It was in black and white, not color; (B) it included no cuts featuring Dr. John and Grand Funk Railroad; and, (C) it was 60 minutes in length -- the package even says so -- not the 90 minutes reflected in the listing. The quality of the material included was only fair. My recommendation is that you shouldn't buy this unless you are a die-hard Bobby Darin fan. I AM a die-hard Bobby Darin fan, and I'm still returning it."
5,Music from Lonesome Dove - Soundtrack Album,Was a gift and it was well worth the search! He was quite happy with it and had been looking in stores for awhile.
4,Reminding us about the joys of life,"This is a modest sized book but is packed with realistic yet positive messages about family, love, racism and the journey of life. The poems are deceptively simple, sweet, gentle, but powerful. There are at least five or six poems in the collection that are worth keeping and reading several times.I had the pleasure of hearing Damar read from this book when he attended a poetry reading I host and I feel fortunate that he will be a featured reader at a couple of upcoming poetry events I'm involved with.Poets write because they have to, and Damar is a poet who is worth your time to read."
4,"Hey man, it's cool!","It's... a bit off key, but still this is a cool CD. It's just guitar and it sounds awesome"
1,Oh. My.,"The fact that someone spent money to record and distribute this ""tribute"" is truly depressing."
3,Not as pictured and very small,"This product was much smaller than shown, but it is very functional and small, however not very robust. A few weeks later I found a better product for less money at Walmart that scans most cards."
1,not recommended for profs,This is without a doubt the worst educational book I have ever had to use in my days of school. I am a 5th year senior in college. The problems given at the end of each chapter do not go with the examples in the chapter. No way to learn how to do the problems.
4,Helpful Book,Ordering from Amazon saved me money from having to buy it from the school's bookstore. I find this text book easy to understand and very helpful.
2,Some terrible acting here!,"This play is acted as badly as I spell!I could see that when done well the result might be of some humor,but much of that is lost in bad delivery and relatively poor staging.The sound quality and picture quality is equally ugly.Several of the player are better than the overall quality,but dragged down by theproduction as a whole.A quarter of the way through I almost gave up watching asit hurt me to see the good lines so undone!It may be a good thing this is Shakespeare's only prose play,because such misuse of a play is a crime of the stage."
3,OPI,"I like it, as always OPI nail polish are the best! I thought the color was going to be stronger than it actually is, though. But I like it anyway!"
3,Not as good as the black,"I purchased the black in March, and LOVED it!!! My friends and daughter loved it as well. I had been trying to find another black for my daughter, but it was sold out everywhere!! When I heard that Opi was coming out with a silver, I HAD to get 2 bottles (I actually got 4 bottles, because my friend wanted some for her and her daughter). I waited outside of the store on mother's day to buy them. I did my toes, but was not please with the result. This was VERY thick, and almost dry when I first opened it. My daughter did not like it either. It did not crackle as well as the black (which is very thin), and I really could not find a color that I LOVED pairing it with. I think the black and white are the way to go. Out of the 4 bottles of silver, no one really likes it. I am returning one of the bottles that was not used. At $8.50 (what I paid), it is too expensive to not ABSOLUTELY love it."
5,love it!,"I love every single color of the OPI shatter collection. Since this one is a glitter formula it is a little harder to work with, but I still love it just as much as the others."
4,Good Polish,"Like the Pirates of the Caribbean polishes. They only work on certain skin tones, as I've discovered. Decent from OPI."
3,Okay if you like gray.,"I liked the fast delivery but was just a little disappointed in the color.my first time trying this product and have seen other people using it so will now buy the black with a hot pink and seen how to really get the effect I was looking for so I'm not really to disappointed I guess I just didn't know what to expect,that is the only reason I gave it only 3 star's.First time user's what do you expect???"
2,not impressed,"I was not impressed with this product, when comparing it to China glaze shattered nail polish it is much better than OPI. Once i put the other one on it cracked immediately. OPI did crack but was barely noticeable."
5,my favorite color!,"I was iffy about purchasing a nail polish online because i know colors can vary. But after receiving and using this color (stranger tides), i wanted to make sure to write a review to show how great the color is, and it is pretty accurately pictured on the website as well. It is a very subtle sage green and since i wear a lot of neutrals, it matches everything! i put it on my toes and fingers and have gotten lots of compliments already. I'm glad OPI made this color :) i will definitely purchase again and again!"
2,silver crackle nail polish,great & fast service have other crackle nail polishes love them!!! This silver crackle polish only looks good with black underneath:(
3,Not worth all the hype,I've tried this polish a couple of times since I purchased it but the results have been so-so. I've tried applying the polish in a couple of different ways but find that I can't get a nice crackle--instead I get silver polish with a few hairline cracks.
3,Doesn't Shatter Good,"The silver shatter is a good decoration to nails, but it doesn't shatter well. I have used this twice and it just looks like silver polish over the base color. Maybe it's because I put it on too thin. The black shatter is so much better than the silver one. Maybe I will use a thicker coat. Hopefully that works."
4,Shimmery Silver!,Product as descripted and fast shipping! The shatter is kinda hard to see over light colors like the Skulls & Glossbones in the Pirates of the Carribean Collection.
3,okay.,"I got the black shatter before this one and i was very impressed with the black. The silver, it works, but not nearly as well. It still gives the shatter effect, but you have to use a darker color and it sort of appears like you just did a really bad job applying a silver sparkley top coat. Farther away, it's great, but up close, it's not as good as the black."
4,gorgeous but slightly more blue,"like the title, this was beautiful nail polish but slightly blue..very slight just not as minty. This is a very dependable brand, always has smooth creamy colors with nice brushes that are wide so it doesnt get all cruddy. I wish it had eco-friendly ingredients :/ but its so pretty that I will be a bad person for this brand. lame but honest."
3,Definitely worth seeing,"This is a surprisingly funny and engaging movie about two patients in a hospital. The humor is often dark and/or sophisticated. ""The Medicine Show"" is a little uneven in quality, but Natasha Gregson Wagner is captivating as Lynn Piegi, an interesting, quirky, amazingly up-beat gal. Jonathan Silverman's portrayal of the other patient, Taylor Darcy, is much lower key, but serves as an effective foil for Lynn. More broadly, this movie is an interesting and insightful study of the sociology of life, romance, the threat of death and dying, and the challenges of being a family member and of being a hospital patient.""The Medicine Show"" might function better without the tacky sexual humor at its beginning. Consider starting at Chapter 5 on the DVD."
2,The most confusing Alarm clock with the WORST sounds!,"I purchased this for my husband who likes to sleep with some sort of noise. I thought this might work. Well, the nature sounds are the WORST I have ever heard. The LCS is not that big or bright and the snooze button is very close to the OFF button which is not good. I guess for someone who really likes gadgets and studies their new electonic toys may like this clock, but personally I found it confusing. This is not a pull out of the box and use clock. I swear you couldn't figure out how to set the alarm without the manual. You have to push 3-4 buttons to accomplish it. What we wanted if for was useless and there was WAY too many stupid extras. We ended up selling ours at a yard sale."
2,Works OK But Not Perfect,"First of all, the nature sounds are horrible and completely unrealistic. If you're considering getting this product just for the nature sounds, you're better off buying something else. If you're an audiophile and are easily annoyed by poor sound quality of radio stations and plan on using this as your primary radio, then get something else.Otherwise, it works okay as an alarm clock. The light is dim enough not to be annoying when I am trying to sleep, and I am really sensitive to light in my bedroom when trying to fall asleep. The alarm goes off on time. I can set one alarm with the buzzer and one with the radio for a backup alarm if I fall asleep after turning off the first alarm.I'm sure there are better alarm clocks out there, but I have a hard time finding alarm clocks without annoyingly bright digital time displays that keep me awake at night."
1,Only good for 3 months........,"I've had 2 of these and my sister in law also purchased one. All three clocks had the same exact problem occur. After about 3 months of regular usage, the radio and nature sounds function ceased to work. Coincidence? I think not.It worked fine up until then. Don't buy!"
3,Unchangable DST Feature,"I loved this alarm clock but it has an automatic (DST) Daylight Savings feature. When the DST dates where changed last year, it still went off of the internal programmed dates from the factory. So when the date arrive to ""fall back"" and hour, the clock time remains the same. After I manually change it, three weeks later, the clock ""fell back"" another hour and I was almost late for work.The other features are great but it you want this for an alarm clock, buyer beware. I just bought a new clock with an adjustable DST feature."
5,Perfect,"I spent five or six hours scouring Amazon and other sites for a good clock radio that would meet my 3 most important requirements: Digital radio tuning with presets, battery backup (for when the electricity goes out), and a dimmamble display. All three were completely met by this radio.-The radio works great and picks up all the stations I can pick up in my car.-The battery backup works as advertised.-The display has multiple dim settings, and no matter how light sensitive you are, the dimmest setting will work! Take my word for it.And for the price, the speakers are great for a radio. However, do not buy this for the ""nature sounds."" Their sounds are not clear and are actually more annoying rather than soothing."
3,Nice but can't read display!!,"This is a decent clock - nice sounds and lots of features. However, the small, dim orange display is pretty tough to read if you don't keep your alarm clock by your bed, especially if you have a lot of light in your room. The nice, compact size and mp3 in are a plus, but the display is disporportionately small to the size of the clock. Returned it; going to try out the more expensive Timex clock. A good clock with nature sounds is tough to come by!"
2,"Difficult to program, fake-sounding ""nature"" sounds","The best thing about this alarm clock is the styling. The battery back-up for power failures is also good, and I like the feature where you can set it to different wake-up times for the week and weekend. However, it is clunky to program, with the ""instructions"" being insufficient help. The radio is easy to set for listening, but the alarm radio reverts to the factory preset, and it is difficult to figure out how to set it. The ""nature sounds"" are really lame as well, because the audio loop is so short. For example, the wave sound is one wave and a bird call so you can go nuts hearing ""whoosh, squawk, whoosh, squawk, over and over. The ""forest sounds"" seem fake, and so on. The only decent one is ""wind"" because wind sounds the same no matter how short the loop is."
1,Don't waste your time,"Looks great, worked great for the first day.... then everything on it broke except the volume. I couldn't get any of the buttons to work, etc. There is a 90 day limited warranty on it, but I'm not even going to waste my time to ship it, PLUS pay SDI to fix it."
2,"Nice features, BUT . . .","This clock radio has some nice features (waking to CD, pleasant LCD, separate weekday/weekend alarms, nature sounds, etc.) BUT these are only good it if works. The CD player stopped working after about a year, the radio reception is poor, the clock always ran slow and had to be reset about every 2 months, and my unit just completely died one night after about 6 years of use. I wouldn't buy this again even though I liked the features."
3,not as good as original one i bought,"i bought the new updated version of my old sound alarm clock and was somewhat disappointed. i have since decided to continue using the old one until it completely dies, and have put the new one up in an unused bedroom upstairs!! will probably have to consider another brand next time - seemed too much trouble to send it back, so i kept it."
2,I bought this from Amazon...,"I bought this through ""Amazon.com"" and they will not allow me to comment on what I paid for this item through Amazon.com as opposed to other places. But, the clock itself is pretty nice even though I paid 66% more through Amazon.com then I could have elsewhere."
1,Died After 6 Months,"I've used this alarm clock all year and it died IN LESS THAN A YEAR. And when I bought it, it was $80. Don't waste any of your money on it."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Purchased this item SPECIFICALLY for the ""wind"" sound. Received the item and, instead of ""wind"" it had ""wind chimes"". Sent the item back and am now waiting for my refund... minus the shipping... minus the 20 percent ""restocking"" fee.Expensive lesson to learn."
2,too difficult to use alarm,"i was seceptical about this alarm clock after reading the reviews, but ordered it anyway. i sleep with a sleepmate (makes white noise) and needed an alarm clock. i was hopeful that this clock would serve both purposes. after reading the pamphlet for 15 minutes, i can now use the white noise function. i'm sure that i could figure out the alarm with more reading, but it's just too complicated as i will only be using this alarm clock at my vacation cottage. by the time i get back to the cottage, i'll have to read the manual again. so, this is fine for a sleepmate (white noise machine), but i'll use the alarm on my cell phone. also, i do like how dim the time display gets. this would be great if the alarm were easier to use."
4,Timex Alarm Clock,"While on vacation, this alarm clock was in the condo we were renting. It was good looking, not to large for our nite stand, large lighted dial. So we immediately ordered one when we returned home. We not not unhappy with this purchase."
4,Sound Asleep ahhhhh,"I have a tough time falling asleep and this unit is perfect. It has 4 different nature sounds that allow you to set 15, 30, 60 or 90 minutes at the touch of a button. The quality of the sound is o.k.... better a bit louder. I often times wake up in the middle of the night....simply push the sound button and your out! I love it. The light display has 2 different dim light features for those who are senstive to the light. There are several alarm settings for days, weekends etc. I feel this unit is a great value for the price."
5,Timex keeps on ticking,Just a short review. I bought this Clock/Radio a few years ago and it has been great ever since. I like the way the alarm sounds at first and gets faster as it progresses till you turn it off. It has a nice look and a small foot print. The radio is not the greatest but it is plenty good for my area with reception. Overall this is a good buy you won't be sorry.
3,Features over Design,"This alarm clock looks catchy because of the high feature list, however I warn you that this item is not actually well designed. There are several areas where they simply could have done much much better, but instead it seems they just threw the clock together.The sounds don't so much sound like the ocean or the wind, but really just an injured seagul or static from my old TV. Waking up to these sounds are not really what I want, I was hoping to sleep to them, but the quality of each sample is too bad to be relaxing.One thing this does get right is the large snooze button on top. However like other alarms if you snooze more than 4 times it shuts itself off. Of course this is an hours worth of snoozing, but I don't always know that in the mornings. :-)"
3,I don't see the problem!,"After reading the many poor reviews of this product, I started not to purchase it. I do not see what everyone had problems with. It is very easy to set the time and alarms and I did not even need to read the instructions but once. The only problem that I have is that the nature sounds loop is too short. I use the oceans sound to go to sleep to and the forest with the birds to wake me up (the birds do a good job of this). The radio works very well. I set the radio to come on two minutes after the forest to make sure that I wake up. The time is very easy to see and adjust for brightness. I believe that this is a very good product at a very acceptable price!"
2,Died after 6 months,"We had liked this clock for a variety of it's features, but can not recommend it because it died after 6 months. There is only a 3 month warranty-clue!"
2,Annoying Nature Sounds & Design,"If you're thinking about getting this clock radio for its nature sounds, think twice. The few choices are too annoying to listen to. Also, setting an alarm is not easy, having to hold down buttons for too long to move the time setting forwards or backwards, plus, the buzzer that goes off when its set is too loud."
1,Frustration,"This alarm clock is driving me crazy. The nature sounds don't work, all I get is obnoxious beeping, and setting it is a pain. If I set more than one alarm (out of the three) a day the only reason it helps me wake up is because I get so confused trying to turn the alarms off that I can't fall back asleep, and start my day grouchy. This is the worst alarm clock I have ever purchased, and my roomate agrees that the beeping is awful."
5,Lots of features for a little clock,"The nature sounds are just OK, but the ability to set different alarms for different times is working well for me. I am NOT a morning person, but hated the jarring buzzing alarms and radio alarms were not waking me up. I use a nature sound for the first 10 minutes then the buzzer. I am waking up in a much better mood :) The buzzer is neat because it starts out at 1 buzz and progresses to more and louder buzzes."
4,Keep the manual in a safe place!!!,"I bought this alarm clock for my son. It's stylish, accurate, doesn't take much space, and the nature sounds option for alarm is great for those who are easily startled by a sudden loud alarm. However, my son was travelling for a month and forgot to turn it off. This clock is NOT easy to figure out. Several times I thought I had turned the alarm off only to awaken to it the next morning. I couldn't tell by looking at the display whether the alarm was on or off. I ended up having to unplug it. I have not been able to find the manual online."
5,Just as described,Product arrived on time and just as described. The ball and chain really likes this alarm and I appreciate the soft tones she wakes up to. Much better than the typical buzzing alarm.
2,"cute little toy, but not much of a radio","Operation was in now way intuitive. reception was poor all over the AM band and the right half of the FM band.Hard to handle without disturbing the volume control unless using two hands. (two-handed handling not easy while reclining.)I'll keep looking for a good, simple, easy to set and use, bedside clock radio. This one I will retire to a giveaway box as soon as I find a more suitable ""waker-upper"".My old Bose wave radio finally quit after nearly twenty years and I'm hoping to find a suitable replacement for less than $ 350.00."
3,No CD player,"I have the deluxe model which has been discontinued and LOVE it! I thought that I was buying the same thing for my daughter. No CD player. Ugh! The display doesn't go dim enough, but it's small and tidy, doesn't take up much space. Decent sound. Good nature sounds replicated."
2,Clock radios really shouldn't be this difficult to operate.,"I'm really a very technically savvy person. Given this, I refuse to read the manual for a simple clock radio. Therefore, I have somehow managed to set this thing to 7AM Monday thru Friday and have no idea how I did it. I didn't even realize it could play nature sounds until I read the other reviews. I hate this thing, it's way too hard to figure out. If you can't figure out how to set a damn clock without the manual, it's not worth your time. Excuse me as I go back to shopping for a new clock radio before Daylight Savings hits."
3,worth it,"i really enjoy owning an alarm clock that has a timer on it so i can either listen to the radio to fall asleep to or nature sounds to fall asleep. the only negative thing i would have to say about this product is that the OFF/RESET button is close to the SNOOZE button, there was one occasion where reaching for the snooze button, i hit the reset button and the buzzer never came back on. since then i have learned to consciencly avoid that."
4,It's a Really Nice Clock!,"I bought this clock about 2 years ago and it is still working just as good as when I bought it! The preset stations and setting the alarm and time was very easy to figure out. Just like someone else said on here, didn't ever get out the book to figure it out. The sounds all sound the same, but didn't buy it just for that. If the sounds would be clearer I would have rated this a 5. I love the 3 alarms that's a really great feature plus you can select five days a week or 7 or just daily. I do however sleep very sound and wish the volume would go up higher, but it works. I recommend to anyone to buy it, as the narrow upright sleek look is great. Would be a nice addition if Timex made it with those updates and maybe a bluelit background instead of the orange, as I like everything to match."
2,"Other than the alarm, and the reliability, it's great!","Of course, those are two important aspects of an alarm clock. The placement of the snooze button and ""turn the alarm off, really off, for keepsies"" button is a fatal design flaw for an alarm clock, as it's way too easy to accidentally turn the alarm off when you just want snooze.Another irritant with my alarm clock (I imagine it's just a defect in my particular clock, as I haven't seen it mentioned elsewhere) is that the battery backup doesn't appear to work at all. Which is obviously bad if the power goes out in the middle of the night, but also bad at other times, since reprogramming the thing is a rather laborious process, and somewhat fraught with peril (the AM/PM distinctions aren't always clear.)Nice radio, though, and attractive, but fails at the tasks I need it to be most reliable at performing."
2,Timex Let me down...,"This is a fine clock with its multple alarms. Easy to setup. The radio get good reception on both AM and FM, especially complared to other clock radios. The snooze button works well (grin) with it location and size.The only disappointment was the nature sounds. They are harsh and do not lend themselves to being percieved as pleasing ambient sound. The rain is almost nice if it didnt have this high pitch bird sound. I also miss the blue indiglo color timex use to have."
4,"Great features, Good Looking, Reception could be better","This is a good unit for the price.Pluses:- Great display, large and clear- Not too bright too sleep next to- Nature sounds surprizingly useful to wake up to- Separate volume for ""sleep"" mode so you can go to sleep at low volume and wake up to a higher volume.- You pick the station to wake to for the radio alarm so you wake to that station regardless of what you were listening to last.- Digital tuner- Time is displayed and alarm (tone only) works when power is out.- CompactMinuses:- One strong local signal drowns out other FM stations.- Doesn't pull in distant stations.- Sound is as expected for a small radio."
3,Not for those who wear glasses,"This is a pretty good clock radio, but don't buy it if you wear glasses and have a pretty high number. The luminous dial is hard to read at night, because the numbers (though large) don't stand out the way they do on clock radios that have just the lighted numbers. The features are nice though."
1,timex radio,"This radio is awful. The sound is tinny, the selection dial to get the stations is so small and low that you can't see it. The speaker is on top and tipped to the rear so your sound goes that direction! The time display is the only thing good about it. Have had mine 11 months and wish I could get my money back."
3,great clock but what's up with the snooze???,"Unit looks great and functions well, but the snooze seems to stop working after the 2nd time?? I've checked the manual and the snooze is supposed to continue working for at least an hour, but in my experience it only works twice, then the alarm never comes on again..."
4,NATURE ALARM CLOCK,"I've had several ""sound machines"" to help me sleep at night; this is the first one combined with an alarm clock as well. I find it quite pleasing, although the selection of sounds is limited compared to other machines. The night light has three levels, however, for those of us who need glasses to see it's useless at night although it provides one with a sufficient ""night light"" to see your way clear back to bed without stumbling."
3,not Intuitive,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. As most guys do, he threw away the directions. I cannot figure out how to set the alarm and it is so frustrating! (yes I can program my VCR/DVD)"
3,Unintuitive interface --- don't lose your user's manual!,"I have had this clock radio for about a year now, and for the most part, it has worked well for me. I can always count on the alarm to wake me up at the time I've set it.However, I deeply regret having lost the manual because I cannot figure out how to change the radio station for the alarm (which is a different setting from the normal listening radio tuning feature). I have tried everything under the sun that I can think of, and I can't believe it can be this complicated. I wish there were a way to simply repurchase the manual. It shouldn't be this hard."
1,Croaked after just a couple of weeks!,"This radio seemed really nice at first - good sound, easy to use, very convenient digital presets. Then suddenly it failed. None of the buttons worked any more, and the nature sounds came on by themselves. Unplugging the clock and removing the backup batteries until the display cleared did not reset the thing. So, back it went, and the hunt for a clock radio that actually works continues..."
4,great purchase,"The battery back up feature ACTUALLY WORKS on this alarm clock. It's saved me twice already. There are two things I'd like to change - the fact that after I hit snooze on the radio and then snooze on the buzzer, only the buzzer comes back in 10 minute increments. I'd rather hear the radio in 5 and the buzzer 5 minutes later. Also, snooze length cannot be adjusted. One day that's going to get me! I REALLY appreciate the small size and ease of set up. Very nice looking too!"
1,aghhh,Not even slightly intuitive to program and use. Terrible reception and cross feed on the channels. My wife bought this and has been subsequently forbidden from ever buying any home electonics.All I wanted was a friggin alarm radio that I could wake up to. I'm giving this to my daughter and buying something that I can tune in and program without a manual.
2,This thing sucks,I bought this not too long ago and it only worked for a month and after that month it started making a humming sound out of the speakers. Its not really worth the money.
2,Works just fine...,"Although smaller than I anticipated (not that it's a bad thing), this alarm works well for me. I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the Nature Sounds can be a bit grinding and repititious, and it is fairly complicated to program due to all of the features they have tried to incorporate. It's dependable, the sound is fine, and it is nice looking. I wouldn't recommend for someone who wants a one-touch alarm system however."
4,Love it!,"Great clock, sounds could be slightly more realistic and it would be better if the settings ran on a 12-hour system with an am/pm selection instead of having to run through 24 hours to get to desired time, but still, I had purchased a couple of others and this is the best.Love the look, easy to understand."
3,Don't buy if you live in Arizona or Indiana!!!,"There is no way to turn off the auto DST feature, so if you live in Arizona, Indiana, or anywhere else that doesn't observe DST, you won't want this clock. Twice a year the clock will reset in the middle of the night to adjust for DST, but that is a HUGE problem if you don't observe it!!!"
2,Poor LED,"I returned this alarm clock for one main reason: the LED readability. Someone else mentioned this before, but the LED is meant to be viewed from above. The alarm does have settings for adjusting the brightness of the orange LED, the problem is that it's illuminated from top - down, and instead of the numbers being illuminated the background is illuminated in orange. So basically, if you try to read the time when you're looking up to the clock (i.e. if you're laying in bed at or below the level of the clock), it will be harder to read the time because the light (coming from top-down on the display) will interfere with your ability to distinguish the numbers. Very poorly designed, in my opinion."
4,T309T Alarm clock,"Excellent product. Confusing instructions. It took me about 3 days of trial and error adjustments to be able to set it correctly for the use of the 3 alarm feature.Two of the 3 alarms (the ""water sounds"", and the ""beeper"") do not allow any volume control, as best as I can tell. (The instructions are so poorly written, that I am not certain about this limitation even after owning it for several weeks.) The 3rd alarm (radio) does provide a means for volume control. The lack of a volume control could present a problem for some users, since the loudness of two of the three alarms is permanently set to a very low volume level."
1,Horrible Sound,"This piece of garbage sounds like one of those old transistor radios you might have had as a kid. You are better off opening your window if you want to hear bird sounds. I might have expected the radio to sound bad, but it made the cds sound like 8-track tapes. Ended up buying a Sony from Amazon for only $10 more."
2,don't buy it if you like it dark,"This thing is so bright, even at its dimmest, that we put layers of window tint over the display- but of course now we can't see it in the daytime. Why don't clock makers get it? BRIGHT DISPLAYS NEGATE ALL THE SOOTHING SOUNDS!"
3,Was hoping to fall asleep to these sounds..,"I needed a new alarm clock and thought combining sleep sounds and an alarm clock would be great to drown out noise of my roommates. Don't plan on using the sounds to fall asleep to... they are obnoxious and I would become startled just as I started to doze off. I couldn't handle the seagulls suddenly cawing, or the frog suddenly chirping, so I stopped using it to sleep with and resorted to sleeping with a loud fan instead.However, as an alarm clock, it's great. I like that I can set it to gently wake me up at 4:00 AM and then have it abruptly wake me at 4:10 if I happen to turn off the first alarm (with all good intentions of getting up, of course).The MP3-hookup component is nice, though I have yet to use it."
1,"Please, for your own sake don't buy this clock.","This is my roommate's clock. It's 5:00 in the morning, and I'm just trying to figure out how to set it so I can wake up for class in 3 hours. So far, I've visited the TIMEX website, (which was IMPOSSIBLE to navigate, and didn't even have a section for non-watches) read these reviews in hopes of finding out how to set the freaking thing and messed with it for like 45 minutes, and I've gotten nowhere. Holding down the 'TIME' button makes the time on the display screen flash, but pushing the forward and reverse buttons (at least on my model) does absolutely nothing to change the hour it reads. It keeps randomly making horrible nature sounds even when I don't press anything. It's is a faulty piece of crap that is difficult to use in the first place, and goes haywire within a month of its purchase.I just want to sleep, and this clock is making me wanna die."
1,not all its cracked up to be!!!!,"while the design of the clock is appealing, it fails miserably in function. the face of it is angled up, so it has to be placed lowered then your bed so you can see the time. i like to have my alarm clocks across the room on a shelve so i have to literally get out of bed and turn it off which in return keeps me from going back to sleep. even if the clock is exactly level to you, you still cant tell what time it is from across the room. this is truly an awful design for any alarm clock. also the volume wheel is behind the alarm clock which is awkward to get at. but the worse thing yet is the setting of the time and the alarm its just a pain in the arse, you have to go through all the hours and mins to get to the time you want, it doesn't have a thing where you can set the hour, and mins individually so it takes a few minutes to set just hope your electricity doesn't go out allot. i bought it and took it back the next day, truly very disappointing."
2,Clock does not keep good time,"I bought this clock radio several years ago for the purpose of having a CD player next to the bed to play audio books and as an alarm clock. For playing CDs it worked perfectly. However, this radio has never kept good time. It always runs fast, it adds a minute about every third day. Within a month it is around 10 minutes fast, thus completely unreliable. How can the most basic function for a clock/watch company not work correctly????Furthermore, the light given off by the display is so bright that I am forced to lay a cloth over it at night.I would definitely not recommend buying this product unless you do not mind reseting the clock once a month (not a big deal, but should not have to be done for a digital clock)."
2,Awfully awkward interface,"While Timex watches are great there alarm clocks are frustrating. An alarm clock should at minimum be able to be set easily and quickly. This one isn't exceptionally hard to set, but it takes to long. There are only two buttons used to change the time, one for going a minute forward and one for going a minute back. When you press the button it ticks along slowly then speeds up, so if you wanted to set your alarm for an hour earlier then it takes about 45-50 seconds. Such a simple task shouldn't take so long at the tune of thirty dollars. Also, the nature sounds are awful. But on a positive note, being able to break your alarms up into weekdays, weekends, and daily is useful."
2,"Great sounds, terrible clock","We've been using this radio for the last year and enjoy waking to the gradually increasing nature sounds. Problem is that the ""clock"" keeps terrible time. The clock will go out of sync with a regularly updated clock source (cable box, cell phone) by a minute within a month of setting. Over six months you're getting up more than 5 minutes later than desired. Not sure how the manufacturer could make such a huge mistake. It is the worse clock in the house. On Amazon now looking for a replacement."
4,pure heart singing,no need to ask some one else what is being said or why.you feel every song or at least under stand what his music meet to him and his fans.
5,Perfect Icing Spatula!,"This is a perfect size multi-purpose icing spatula. It works great on cupcakes, mini cupcakes, cakes, Bundt cakes, and finish and detail work. Obviously if you are frosting a large sheet cake you may want to use a larger spatula to save time. This spatula also does a great job of icing the inner circle of a Bundt cake. If you use a larger spatula on a Bundt it is much more difficult to manage it in the inner circle. It is a breeze to make simple swirl designs in your frosting with this spatula. It is also very easy to clean. Highly recommended!"
2,Poor Summary of Fencing Techniques,"The first part of Mr. Werner's book covers the basics of the three weapons (foil, epee, and saber), and the second half is a autobiographical account of the author's experiences begining to fence. The first half of the book is very light...not explaining footwork, stances, or bladework in enough detail to be truly helpful. The photos used are not very helpful either, even though the use of PVC tubes over the blades to increase visibility in the photos is a good idea. The journal is interesting, but leaves me with little respect for the author. He comes across as whiny and slightly juvenile in his approach to fencing. I would pass this one up."
4,Intresting,"A very interesting book, I will be exploring this sport further and this was a great starting point."
3,A 3. 5!,"Great album. The great Uni-Dois-Tres is more then worth the price. Fantastic compilation and loosely mixed for optimum party vibe. Not what most would consider ""true"" dub, but then again dub is about improv and re-use, while being sonically deviant. Dub Club is not a dubby down beat swarthy thing, but rather an interesting collection of bouncy dub influenced tracks. You will bang this album at your next party and you will feel good!"
2,"great voice, bland songs","I first heard the song 'Como Tu Mujer' on a tape of various artists and I thought, 'who is this woman with this moving and powerful voice?!' So needless to say I sought out to hear more of her songs. But unfortunately on this CD I was disappointed by all the other songs. Then I noticed they were written by a different songwriter...I don't have the CD anymore, but I wonder if the incredible Ms.Durcal has sung anymore songs by the writer of the song that I had fallen in love with."
3,Not worth $15,"I enjoyed the combination of writing and photos, but neither could hold up on their own. The writing left much to be desired. It was jumpy and went off on a few tangents. Some of the photos were decent while others were blurry. I paid $5 at a sale for this book and that's about all i would spend on it."
4,Surprizingly good,"The book follows a family that has chosen a career to be farmers. Organic is their niche, but farming is the topic overall. There are a few great pictures in the book, that add value to it. I enjoyed the book and if you are interested in organic farming this book gives light to the details."
4,Just sit back and enjoy...,"A cordial narrative about a year in the life. Not meant to be overly academic, but intended to provide a peek into the day-to-day happenings on a small, family farm. A pleasant read - great for the nightstand."
2,Is this a book about organic farming or about a marriage falling apart?,"I was expecting a book with more details on how organic farming is actually done. Instead, I found the book to be more a drama of a marriage in danger of falling apart. I found that the author seems to portray characters very negatively. I came away from the book saying, ""I certainly wouldn't want this author to do a book about ME!"" I also found the book to be clumsy to hold, and a funny shape for good reading. It seems like it is meant to be a coffee table book rather than a real read. My biggest disappointment, however, is the simple fact that I was looking for a book with ideas on how to actually make an organic farm work, but instead found a book that portrays organic farming in such a negative light that who would want to try after reading this?"
1,Polder 9102-87 Add 'N' Weigh Kitchen Scale,Did not work. Metal piece from the battery cover meant to hold batteries in place was not attached. Glued it on and still did not work. Returned the scale for a replacement (which also did not work).
5,Language the Easy Way,"My grandson developed a large vocabulary before the age of three by using the Usborne CD-Rom in English. I have been looking for the Usborne CD-Rom series in Italian, German, and Chinese, but can't find any other Usborne language software products."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"Here's another product I'm disappointed with. It does not do what it proclaims...keep your food hot/warm. My kids chicken nuggets were cold at lunchtime after being placed in the oven, then wrapped in foil, and then placed inside the thermos in the morning @ 7am."
1,Food was cold,"Like several reviewers, I too was not impressed with Campbell's Thermal Soup Bowl. I followed the instructions but my son told me on several occasions that his food was cold. I would love to find a great product (that works) so I may provide my child with a warm lunch."
1,don't waste time,"Please don't waste your time on this product. I thought the other reviewers must not have tempered the bowl correctly and decided to give it a shot. Nope, it really doesn't work. Honestly, just puting your food in a $1 Ziplock tupperware is better. Plus the tupperware will not leak unlike this campbell's bowl. I really wanted to like it. I thought I'd just use it to warm my pasta and rice- NOPE didn't do that either. I tempered it w/ hot water 10 mins and the food got cold in less than 1 hour. I think sending the food in my tupperware would have been much better.... I bought a Thermos food jar instead. My kids liked batman/superman/bakugan so i bought those character thermos food jar instead and it works great!"
2,"Lukewarm, not hot","Doesn't keep food hot. Even after preheating this with hot water and filling right before I leave the house (about 7:15AM) the contents are still only lukewarm at lunch time (11:30 or 12:00). Also, you have to be careful not to tip the container while travelling. We ordered 4 of these and all 4 of them leak. All are being returned."
1,Don't waste your money - not water-tight,"This container is not water-tight. I bought it to send my 7 yr old to school with hot soup for lunch, but this will leak all over her lunch box before she even gets to school."
4,jfish,"Got this for my grandson to take hot food in his lunch because he doesn't like sandwiches everyday. I put soup, speghetti, and other things in it. You have to put hot water in it and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Food is still warm when its time for lunch"
2,Doesn't keep food warm,"The thermos is well made and doesn't leak. It is easy for a child to open. However, even with pre-heating, it barely keeps soup or chilli warm for four hours until lunch. My 11 year old was very disappointed. Keeping food hot/warm is a key element to a good thermos, and this one doesn't do it."
1,Does not work,This thermos was the perfect size but it did not keep my son's food hot just a few hours until lunch time.
3,not so great,"I love Stacy's regular Pita Chips, but was not crazy about these.. and I am a huge cinnamon-sugar fan."
5,New SAT 2005: Inside Out!,"This book is extremely helpful in preparing for the SAT test. My son took David Benjamin Gruenbaum's class and found this book very engaging and user friendly to prepare for this grueling test. The cartoon characters on each page offer precise tips to master the SAT questions. As a middle school teacher, I have used many of the tips for my students in preparing for Standardized state testing. This book would appeal to students of all grade levels.Chris"
1,Rediculous Book,"I purchased this text to study for the New SAT on the advice of the reviews on Amazon. Boy was I disappointed!!!! This thing is silly and rediculous and has no CD to help me take exams on my own. My friends bought another book with REAL SAT exams in them not goofy characters from a comic book, and now so will I!! Not a good buy at all!!Jodi Amagon"
4,Useful and entertaining,"I like this book about the new SAT test that's going to be coming out because it's both useful and entertaining. Information and advice are interspersed with scenes from a fictional SAT preparation class with hopelessly confused students. This isn't a book with lots of practice exams. It's more of a ""tips and tricks"" book with some humor thrown in. And there are some really good tips that would never have occurred to me, especially in the math sections. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of kids out there who would find it a fun change from the dry routine of studying."
1,A low quality book,"We bought this text for our two children in grades 10 and 11 to use to get good SAT scores. Boy, what a disappointment for all of us. The children said that their friends had texts that had actual SAT exams to take on disk. We agreed, and went out and bought just such a book for them to study from. This book is not the caliber that we wanted. Sorry to say it is only a one star for us.Joey S."
1,Cheesy piece of shovelware!,"As the alleged author of this book I'd just like todistancemyself from this cheesy piece of shovelware. Spend the moneyon a printer instead. Or a better monitor. Or some cheese and ashovel. While W3C specs are available under a liberal license, this""book"" is pushing at the limits of polite behaviour. I foundout I was named on the cover via Amazon. If I ever get around towriting a book, it won't have been this one..."
1,A copy of online documents.,"The content of this book is simply copies of two online documents: Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schema Specification 1.0, and the Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax SpecificationIn my opinion, the type quality of this book is awful, and I got better quality printing the two documents cited above on a laster printer. If you don't have a printer, and hate to read things online, then I guess buying this book would make sense. Otherwise I'd recommend you go and download the files yourself."
3,A disappointment.,"This movie was fairly bizarre, delivering a series of goofy horror movie standards laced throughout a story of a broken family. The storyline makes little sense, but this is explained (?) at the end."
4,Billy Crystal variety,If you are a fanatic of Billy Billy get this triple pack. My Favourite is City Slickers with the running scared more of an action movie rather than a comedy.
5,Absolutely Hilarious,"If you want to hear the best prank phone calls. Buy this CD. Buy all three of them if you can take laughing until you vomit. This guy is a genius when it comes to sound effects, voices and just plain pissing people off. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Funny,This is the funniest of a bunch of funny albums. This one is more confrontational and I laugh very hard when listening to the callers get ticked off. You will too.
1,A Total Bore!,I found this CD totally boring. Most of the pranks were so over the top that they were unbelievable. This purchase turned out to be a total waste of money. I enjoyed the Tom Mabe CDs much better.
3,A weaker follow up to the first two CDs,"The Touchtone Terrorists (or rather ""Terrorist"" because one person is doing all of the characters) are hilarious. There's no question. In my opinion, the funniest phony phone callers of all time. But this third CD of theirs is fairly weak when compared to the first two. The calls too often follow exactly the same premise: customers calling up what they think is a courier company to find out about their package. Most of this CD is that same premise over and over again. The first two CDs had a greater variety of scenarios and made better use of the characters.Also, this CD, unlike the previous two, has some ""filler""--tracks that aren't phoney phone calls at all, but instead weak and unfunny skits. Not good.Still, I laughed a lot. The first two CDs are absolute must haves. I listen to them over and over. And even this CD I would recommend. Mediocre Touchtone Terrorists are far better than no Touchtone Terrorists at all."
4,Interesting look into Miss Saigon,This is a very interesting look into the making of Miss Saigon. I only gave it four stars because I expected to see more excerpts from the actual show but that's not the case. It basically takes you through the beginning of the creative and audition process to the opening of the show. It's quite interesting to see how it's all being put together. A definite must see for an aspiring young actor/singer and Miss Saigon fan.
4,Miss Saigon,This is a DVD for fans of the Broadway show Miss Saigon and/or folks who are curious about the process.
1,Not what the name implies,Very disapointed. Not what the name implies. It is in fact all about the auditions. Very little or nothing about the making.
3,"OK, Worth seeing Lea and Monique try out","I have quite a few comments after having watched this video at least 10 times (I've had it for years now). I think it is interesting to see bits and pieces of what contributes to making the ""Miss Saigon"" production. It's exciting watching the cast sing with the orchestra for the first time. Also, watching Lea Salonga nervously sing through Sun and Moon never fails to give me chills. What a sweet voice! However, the video showed too many auditions, and I am disappointed the video did not show the auditions for Simon Bowman, Jonathan Pryce, and Claire Moore. This definitely does NOT subsitute for watching ""Miss Saigon"" on stage. But it is a ""documentary"" video that is must have for Lea Salonga fans/""Miss Saigon"" fans."
2,"Someone Please Do Justice to ""Miss Saigon""","As some of the reviewers below have pointed out, this DVD is primarly about the auditions for Miss Saigon, and in that sense it is merely a ""tease"" for those of us craving to see the actual musical on DVD. And while it is exciting to see Lea Salonga audition and be selected for the lead role, it is overall a very disappointing DVD because of what it is not. I cannot understand why Miss Saigon, one of the greatest musicals ever, has never been filmed for DVD release. Perhaps if the recent DVD release of the musical Chess (another fantastic musical) with Josh Groban is successful, someone will release this outstanding musical for the enjoyment of generations to come."
4,The Heat is on!,"I loved this video! I am a huge theater buff, who's been in quite a few plays and to see all of the elements come together for one of the greatest shows ever, rocked! I always wondered how they found Lea Salonga, who I adore, and I loved seeing all the drama and tension that goes into making a show. I have to say, I was a tad dissapointed that they didn't show more snippets of the show, but the parts they do show I loved. I would have liked to have seen more of Simon Bowman (the best chris ever!)but overall, I loved the movie, and like I was there."
2,"Haven't seen it, but not quite what I'm looking for","I think this would be an exellent documentary, but what about those of us who want to watch the actual show? I may sound toodemanding, but I can't drive to all the larger towns that have regular showings of this. I have seen the show once at MSU. But I would also like to have it where I live, so when I want to experience those feelings that the story and it's characters bring out, I can just pop in the video(or DVD) and be satisfied. True, it may never completely acomplish the ""full-effect"" of see it live, but it's close. All I can find is the making. If anyone has the entire production, let me know!"
3,Batteries for SVAT,"Beware of the fact that these cameras require AC Adaptors to function properly, although you can run the camera using 9V battery, you will not get more than 4 hours of power and the transmission quality will be very poor."
4,horse crazy,The camera served the us well. Night vision is a little grainy but you could make out the mare in the stall. The weather did effect the reception (thunderstorm) but we were still able to make out a faily good picture. The camera sure beat running to the barn every hour to check on mares. Well worth the money spent to get a few winks of shut eye during foaling season.
5,RIVETING.....,"If you want to know more about the post-9/11 world in which we live in today and the kinds of threats that endanger our very way of life, then you must read this book. If you care about balancing your personal privacy with our national security, then you must read this book. And if you want to know how technology can mitigate these risks, then read this book. The subject matter deals with issues surrounding safety, security and privacy, but not in a ""duct-tape and plastic"" sort of way. This book offers a new way of thinking about our national security as well as our personal security concerns. And the fact that it is written with passion and conviction by the CEO of a data analysis company only adds to the intrigue of this book. It's a real eye-opener!"
4,Wake Up Call,"This book will make you think, even if you don't really want to. When the newspapers are filled with fear mongering from the left about a loss of civil liberties, Smith makes a good case as to why if we don't do something to take advantage of new technologies, we'll lose the very rights the left claim to be protecting.Anytime you can get Steve Brill, Orin Hatch and the privacy lobby all on the same page...you're doing something right."
3,Great for beginner R/C user,Durable enough to withstand crashes and usual toy treatment. Steering wheel and trigger makes it easy to use. It doesn't go very fast so it prevents runaways. Plus the remote doesn't work if the user is far away causing the user to follow the truck pretty closely. Fun enough for a short while.
5,Great Whisk,"The KitchenAid Whisk is wonderful to use! It has a nice balanced weight and the handle's size makes it easy to hold on to while whipping eggs, batter, etc."
4,John has few clues to life,"This is a sadly humorous look at the life and times of the greatest drag racer of all time - John Force. The documentary-style DVD follows John and his disfunctional family through the daily routine.At the core of the humor is that John wanted sons but got daughters - three of them. They have followed in his drag-racing footsteps, but John has no clue how to communicate with them. He micro-manages a couple of his daughter's dates, tries to instill some sense of family togetherness by dragging the family to the Donner memorial (pioneers died in mountain snow storms), and other good ideas gone wrong.Though his wife ""still loves him"", they can't live together. She lives separately with the daughters.Life does not treat John with love, but he is lovable in his coarse and hoarse way.I have been to 2 of his Toys for Tots holiday carshows, and there is no doubt he is passionate about whatever he is doing - though the massage by a gay man tested his resolve."
4,Driving Force Season One,Pure entertainment!To those that know the sport they will spot the soundbites used for the cars aren't quite right! And some races start at one track and end at another! Issues that were addressed for season 2 I think.But on the whole great entertainment that even those not into Drag Racing should enjoy.
5,Cost = 6 cents per page and higher.,".HP advertises 6,000 pages = 2 cents per page. However this assumes an unrealistic 5% coverage (i.e. 95% of page is white space).A typewritten page is 15% coverage and therefore = 6 cents per page.An illustration with lots of black can equal up to 45% coverage = 18 cents per page.I've owned this printer for the past 6 years. It's an excellent printer and I gladly pay 6 cents per typewritten page. However, let's keep the discussions of cost honest.."
1,"THIS IS NOT AN ""X"" (maximum pages) CARTRIDGE!","6,000 pages?6,000 pages?I'm at about 800 pages and am running out of ink.Awaiting a response from the provider to see how they handle this."
1,Streaky Mess,"After two months of use without any issues, the ink began to smear a line in one area of each page that was printed. It is simply unusable and a waste of money."
1,Streaks,"Received the item quickly and the initial print quality was good, but after only two weeks of use the cartridge started leaving massive streaks down the center of every page. Perhaps it is just one defective cartridge, but it was a major disappointment."
1,Not an actual HP cartridge,"Despite the nice photo, what I received was an ""HP-Compatible"" cartridge, not an actual cartridge manufactured by HP."
1,Item listed was not the product shipped,"The product shipped was actually a refilled, used Toner cartridge.I returned it for credit but I wasted my time correcting Amazon's mistaken listing, sending correspondence indicating Amazon's mistake, submitting return paper work and taking the item to UPS to ship it back to the vendor for credit, and after about 2 weeks I received the credit to my account!Item is still misidentified on the website."
1,Not compatible with HP 1160 Printer!,"This site DOES have toner that fits the HP1160, but this is not it. Don't be fooled, the HP1160 won't accept a cartridge that prints 6000 pages. Look for the 49A toner for 2500 pages."
4,off-brand toner for HP1320,"The ad is mis-leading--there is no HP anything in this. It is not a re-manufactured cartridge as far as I can tell--all new. So the review is for a brand new HP ""knock-off"" toner cartridge. I've printed maybe 50 pages and so far, so good. No lines, smudges, etc. The magic circuit board on the cartridge seems to keep the yellow light on the printer happy. For the price, it seems like it's a good deal. The question is whether it is high enough quality to be able to refill toner and keep the print quality high. Time will tell."
5,Great help in depression/recession!,"I have purchased three of these cartridges so far at a fraction of the cost anywhere else. Times are hard and this company is doing their part to try and make a terrible economy bearable to us on fixed incomes. I see NO lack in quality, whatsoever."
2,False Advertising,This product was advertised a an original HP laser cartridge.A picture of the original HP box was shown. This product isa knockoff.
1,Don't be fooled!,"This product is a scam. Took cartridge out of the box, popped it into my printer, and it prints incredibly faint. It is completely unusable. Seller won't offer any recourse."
2,Not as advertized,"This product was billed as an HP toner cartridge (see photo). However, it was actually a no name brand that doesn't work well."
4,"Great to have, but missing one episode","I already own the first two Color Honeymooners DVDs and eagerly look forward to Volume 3 and beyond. But I was very disappointed that this edition skipped over the episode entitled ""Life Upon the Wicked Stage"". It's a remake of one of the best Lost Honeymooners offerings, which was titled ""Songs and Witty Sayings"", where Ralph and Norton do a funny mind reading act. Unfortunately, while there were supposed to be 9 shows included here, MPI dropped this one. I called a rep from the company and was told that they had to delete the episode due to music rights issues. However, I noticed that this very show is aired on the cable TV at present. I would much rather have the show edited on DVD instead of not at all, and it's my hope that MPI returns to it and includes it in a future volume."
4,A pleasant finale to a principled career.,"Having read nearly all of Bishop Spong's books, I looked forward to ""Here I Stand"" as a recap of his career. I wasn't disappointed, though I must say that some of his previous efforts, such as ""Rescuing The Bible From Fundamentalism"", held a greater fascination for me due to the freshness of their approach and their more forceful analysis of the requirements imposed on modern Christianity. That aside, this book hammers away with enlightened insight at the self-serving nature of fundamentalist apologetics, while giving the reader a great deal to ponder about the future of christian worship in America and abroad.All in all this book is vintage Spong, and will especially entertain those who haven't read a lot of the Bishop's writings."
5,"""... and the truth shall set you free.""","In HERE I STAND, Jack Spong shares with his readers the development in his theology as he lives into his Christian faith as one who thinks and is open to the experiences of the world in which he lives. I have read all of Jack Spong's books and it was enlightening to experience the what,how and why as each book and its reason for being unfolded.From his rearing in the conservative South to a leader of a broader more liberal Christian understanding, the reader becomes a fellow traveler with Jack Spong as he finds himself on the cutting edge of theology as it is lived out in the post modern world. Jack Spong was and is unafraid to question his faith and its very foundational concepts and in doing so has opened the gospel (good news) to thousands, if not millions, of those in exile who seek a spiritual relationship with the God of all. HERE I STAND gives the reader the opportunity to share this journey toward truth and freedom."
5,The New Right,"I got this book originally because of my husband's interest in Spong's theological viewpoint--to present to him as a gift. The fact that a rabid fundamentalist also reviewed this book so scathingly also compelled me to buy it.The book itself is a study of an extraordinary life lived in the service of the pursuit of good. His dicussion of his life is smooth and gentle--never too despairing or too pious. I see this book as more of a biography than a study of theology.While his theology is fascinating and something to be admired, there are numerous other books by Spong that go into far more detail about his theology. (a theology that makes fundamentalists so defensive that they cling to their faith like barnacles on a ship)All in all, this is an excellent autobiography of an excellent life--a life in love with a God that is all loving for all His children."
3,"Well-written, but too pious.","This book is very well-written, but the author is self-absorbed. This book is bascially about why the author thinks he is so extraordinary. True Christianity means that Christ is foremost, but for this Bishop, he's seems to think he is foremost."
3,Questionable book,"God will bless you! Amen!Will god bless you? Well, Spong does not think so. The preacher stretches out his arms, almost crying into the church.The author questions different parts of the spirituality and religion in a way I do not think one can reconcile if you really believe in Jesus.I hope that the author will not influence too many people in the negative way he does want to. Criticism against everything is good, but not in an unscientific and superficial way! Be critical when you read this book.Yours sincerely, Prof. Bernisi"
1,Negativity,"I was not able to get past some of the contents in this book, I was totally taken back when I read Bishop Spongs comments and statements of the other priests who were in the election of Bishop of Newark. He stated Robert Maitland who was only in the election because of petition. He did not ask to be in the election. He was also accused of be negative towards the Bishop until Rev. Maitlands' retirement. I know first hand Rev. Maitland had much better things in his life than to sit at his desk all day and make up ways to be critical about Bishop Spong. I read the chapter about Rev. Maitland the day before his memorial service was held, he was my father. Bishop Spong has a one sided thought when it came to the Bishop of Newark election. He was not the great one he thinks he is."
5,An Inspiring Life,"Having read several of Spong's previous books, I was thrilled to discover this recently published autobiography. I was eager to learn of the life-shaping events that molded this controversial figure, whose writings have been such a bolster to my personal faith and convictions. The book, an insightful look into both a professional and a personal life, met my every expectation. Often painfully candid, the book reveals a man of amazing courage and unflinching integrity who has stood firm in the face of relentless controversy and ruthless hostility. When I finished the book, I found myself asking, ""Can I be as true to my own convictions despite the cost?"" Thanks for the inspiration, Rev. Spong!"
4,A Decent Book about a Very Decent Man,"I must say I like Bishop Spong better than I liked this book. Not being an Episcopalian, I got bogged down at times in some of the writer's discussions of church ritual and disagreements amongst members of various congregations over such things and found them trivial compared to the larger issue of what the author is all about. I came away from the book, however, feeling that here is the most decent of human beings-- a trait too often not found in members of the clergy, in my opinion-- one who has grappled with issues of race and homosexuality as few in the church have and is not afraid of the consequences of going against many of his fellow clergy for what he believes. I can't think of anyone since Justice Douglas whom I admire and respect more than this man. I am always amazed that the same region can produce both a Senator Helms and a Bishop Spong."
4,Tasty,"This was the first product from Amy's that I tried, and I like it. It doesn't taste like regular chili, but I think that it has a good taste to it. The sodium content is quite high, though, so check that out if your watching your sodium intake. I think that it's a little too expensive, but I'll probably buy it again if it goes on sale."
4,Decent healthy chili,This is a good alternative for a healthy low cholesterol diet. I usually add some hot sauce and it satisfies my chili cravings.
4,Easy read with lots of valuable information,"The best analogy for describing this book is that it's like having several long conversations with a veteran engine builder. It's easy to read and contains lots of valuable tips as well as Ford specific things to watch for.For you late model 5.0L guys, myself included, be aware that the book follows the build of an old-school 302. So the bottom end and valve train are covered pretty thoroughly but I finished craving a bit more 5.0L specific detail such as induction, fuel-injection, computers, etc."
2,Poor coverage for 351M and 400 engines,This book purports to cover the 351M/400 (335)series of engines. Don't believe it! It is a 221 to 351W text that barely makes any mention of the mid block engines. I am very disappointed.
4,Toca Me vs. I Need A Miracle,"Well as the title says, this is the official release of the bootleg ""Toca's Miracle"" by Fragma with vocals from the 1997 Coco track. Aside from the In Petto Mix of ""Toca Me"", I didn't warm up to that track - and personally I feel the vocals add to it. Either with or without vocals though ""Toca"" is a killer track. It may have become more commercial as a result of the vocals, but this is a track that may help trance break into the mainstream (which may be negative or positive whichever way you look at it). Could be a big summer dance hit."
4,"Los Brincos five stars, Serie Platino 4 stars","20 exitos means 20 hits. Obviously hermano Ismael, Esa Mujer, Dance the Pulga.... aren't. Why not ""Lo que yo quiero"", ""Pareces Gitana"", ""Rápidamente"", ""Gracias por tu amor"", and any other of the good song they done?"
1,Relatively slow shipping and didn't accept my memory card,"The description for this item did say it ""may take an extra 1-2 days to process"" but would still fall under Amazon Prime Shipping. I assumed I would have it in 4-5 days, but it was 10 days before I got it and by then, I had actually forgotten I'd even ordered it and was using another product to download my digital photos to my computer. It's still in its packaging. Perhaps if I lose the card reader I have now, I'll be able to use it and see if it was worth the wait.Update: In fact, I did misplace my other card reader, so I finally got around to opening the package for this one, only to find out it doesn't fit the memory card for my Casio Exilim S770 camera. It would be nice if the product description mentioned that it's not universal."
1,Not a hit!,No one in my family liked this. I wasted much of what I purchased. Just didn't like the flavor! I SOUNDED good...
4,A very scary and disturbing book.,"This book, the fifth installment in Allen Drury's ""Advise and Consent"" series, details the very brief presidency of Edwin Jason. President Jason, launched into the White House by the efforts of numerous violent groups, is an unwitting pawn in the hands of enemies of the United States -- with tragic results.In this novel, we say ""good-bye"" to many of the characters we have come to know and love from the previous four novels -- quite a few in a violent fashion.This book is dated -- no question about it -- but the underlying truths expressed by Mr. Drury are still valid -- even if the Cold War IS over and the Soviet Union is no more."
4,Detailed look at the Lincoln County War,"This book is a great description of the events surrounding the Lincoln County War, which is an absolutely fascinating case study of lawlessness in the American West. Although the author's bias is clear--and probably warranted--the entire series of events is well documented and the writing very accessible. To his credit, the author refuses to fall into the trap of making Billy the Kid--who was just a minor figure--the star of the show. Billy remains a background figure almost throughout and the real players in the drama are made memorable. This book does rely very heavily on excerpts from the self-serving letter writing campaign going on during the events."
5,great addition,"I purchased this to add to our homeschool library. While it's not a book that's used everyday, it is a great reference book to help my daughter through her Bible class."
4,"Excellent book, even if you don't play Magic: The Gathering","If you don't play Magic, this book is good. If you DO play Magic this book is great! It's a lot of fun being able to find out how some of your favorite characters from the game really are, especially the humorous Tale of Ertai. And either way, one will still find it hard as hell to put the book down."
3,A must read if you play the game.,"Very good, well written. Adds to the game if you play. Adds meaning to the cards and life to the game. A must read."
2,A Tough reading.....,I know: anthologies are not easy to read. Yet the connecting stories were the best... Finally I understood Gerrad's Quest and what is behind Tempest
4,Excellent Book1,"This book was very good - it was a major part of the Magic Universe. This book only gets four stars for two reasons.1) The climax was very lacking. It just seems like the authors assumed that you would piece everything together. There was no big battle or anything. And what is up with leaving Eirtay behind? And Crovax turning into a vampire? Starke's story never resolved, and many characters were never touched on at the end.2) Errors! I was astonished at the number of grammer errors, typos, and printing mistakes that the editors should have caught. I felt that I was reading a rough draft.Besides this though, the book was well written and I liked learning about each character from their viewpoint. A must read for any Magic fan!"
3,"Must read, because you have to","This book is a must read, only because you will be lost in future books if you don't. I hate anthologies and this is why. There is not enough room to go deep into each of the characters. The thing hops around so much, it is hard to follow. There should have been another trilogy of books to tell the stories properly."
3,"Good, but could have been better.","The one-liner sums it all up. As a whole story, the tale of the Rath Cycle breaks down from the multiple authors. Different viewpoints and retelling of the same stories by different people tends to throw it off balance. However, if you look at each story individually, it holds better. Granted, reading one story in the middle may not make much sense, but you will get a better view of the story from the same author. It does do a good job of telling the Rath story, though; it's just hard to follow sometimes."
4,Good Bag,"Easy to carry and comfortable. Good for traveling to the airport as you can just unzip the top and pull out your laptop. Doesn't have a ton of room for files and extra stuff, but enough to get by."
4,Comfortable and functional,Great design for a small framed person. The bag is longer length-wise and smaller width-wise; so it feels less bulky and is a much more comfortable design for cross-body carrying. Though it is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things; the zipper on the back of the bag is not functioning as designed.
2,Coming apart at the seams,"I purchased this bag five months ago and it is coming apart. The zipper on the back of the bag failed about two months ago and the interior and external seams are starting to separate. I loved the look of the bag but now its looking like I've had it a few years. I use it to bring my laptop and paperwork to and from work and occasionally put a Tupperware container in it for lunch, not really heavy items."
4,Great bag but needs a better strap in future models.,I like this bag and still find it superior to other laptop bags. I love all the little pockets -- especially those designed for laptop-related equipment.I wish the guitar strap solution could be used with this bag -- but the strap is permanently attached. (The key is not to fill it too heavily.) See the reviews for how users added a guitar strap to solve the strap problem on the Mobile Edge Mini Messenger Bag- 9-Inch-13.3-Inch http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Edge-Messenger-9-Inch-13-3-Inch-generations/dp/B000GFHJUS/ref=pd_sim_pc_1....That's my other new favorite bag. The Mobile Edge Mini Messenger Bag- 9-Inch-13.3-Inch -- that's a great bag!!! At one point the zipper broke and Mobile Edge repaired it for me at no cost.
3,Lacks Depth,"I like this book because of it's uniqueness, but I can't help but think of how much better it could be. The text is weak and lacks any insight. To be honest, if there were no text, you wouldn't even notice.The overlays are the most imporatant aspect and can be really iteresting. But they can also be fairly crude and limited. In the long run, I would rather see this technique applied to more travel books with multiple overlays for any city. For example if this technique was used for, say, Paris, and the overlays were used for many areas of the city, I think it would be fabulous. Also an expansion of the timeline, with more than one era shown would be really fun.So I would have to say it's ""eh"" (shoulder shrug)."
4,Blast from the Past (for me),I got these for two of my kids at christmas. I loved them as a child 30 years ago and they loved them too!
2,Poor,Follow the instructions and does not work properly much stick to the wall of the tank and you can not see what is happening.
1,Not worth it,"Not worth the money. If the rocks touch each other, they will not grow straight up. This is too hard for a child to manuever the rocks & liquid and not spill the chemical liquid. Would not buy again."
1,NOT non toxic,I haven't purchased for my 4-yr old becasue I read a review elsewhere that the solutions used are TOXIC and a skin and eye irritant. Correct me if I am wrong.
3,The Third Man-50 Anniversary,"I do agree with the others and was mislead of the album. I understood it would be the sound track only, still it is okay for the price. I sure would like to have the sound track without the voices."
2,"""Soundtrack"" title is correct, but misleading.","The release of this CD was to be the fulfillment of my search for the original recordings of Anton Kara's brilliant musical background to The Third Man. It turned out to be nothing more than a recording of the ""soundtrack"" of the movie itself, or at least the portions of the movie that contained Karas' music. I could have done this myself!! Although I am partially pleased with getting the 'original' score by Karas, it is very distracting to hear the sounds of the actors' voices and other background noises of the film on top of that score. I have purchased other movie ""soundtrack"" CDs before, and none of them contained dialogue from the movie. In that regard, the use of the term ""soundtrack"" for this CD is very misleading."
1,Talking throughout soundtrack - do not buy,"What a disappointment to buy this CD. The composer, Anton Karas, had written a very memorable soundtrack for this movie, one of the most charming and original pieces and arrangements of any soundtrack, up there for 1940s classic movie soundtracks with ""Laura"" by Raksin, Korngold's ""The Sea Hawk"" or Kosma's ""Les Enfants du Paradis,"" so what a shock to discover that all tracks have dialogue from the movie - that is right, ALL, even the main theme at the beginning (Track 2). Who can enjoy Karas' music beneath the spoken track - indeed, one can hear a most varied and interesting variation on his theme that would be very enjoyable to hear without the babble! Avoid this CD at all costs!"
1,Really awful CD,"When I ordered this CD, I thought it would be the wonderful music from the film. Yes, the music is there but it is constantly interrupted with snippets of dialogue spoken over the music. I played it once and will never play it again !!!!!"
1,WTF?,im very dissapointed!! i placed an order on 4-15-10 & i received an email on the 4-25-10 ( when the poster was supposed to be shipped out) stating that the item is out of stock!!! thats messed up!!! very upset!!
5,A great Gift for Birthday,"A very good friend gave me this book on my birthday. It touched me so much.On the back cover these words are written:""Can miles truly separate you from friends?If you want to be with someone you love,Aren't you already there?""Read this tiny but immensely precious book to know more. A truly beautiful gift to give to your friends and loved ones on their birthday."
4,A lovely parting gift,"The first fall after my youngest graduated from high school, and with my oldest married and already moved away, I gave them each this book as I packed up my ""empty nest"" and moved half a continent away. While I don't buy into all of the metaphors Bach uses, he does use them well. We had a wonderful loving moment as I read my (now adult) children a new story as we began life in different states. Evangelical Christians will find fault with the book, as with most of Richard Bach's metaphors, but it is a lovely image of togetherness across miles."
5,Comfort After the Storm,"Richard Bach's ""There's No Such Place As Far Away""hasalways offered comfort after any storm that life has handed me. Thisis an uplifting tale that causes us to look beyond our immediate emotions, into a less selfish point of view. As all other Bach books, there are many lessons to be learned."
2,Was not worth it,"I was told this book was GREAT! The guy who recommended it said it changed the way he looked at life. OK, either I am dense or he was high when he told me that, cause it didn't do anything for me! It was just a silly little book that I am sad I wasted my money on."
2,"Review of ""There's No Such Place as Far Away""",I read this book about 20 years ago and liked it so well that I purchased several copies and gave them to friends who were leaving Ball State University to enter careers in various places in the United States. To me this book epitomizes what it means to have a really true friend; one who is always there for you and no distance or time can separate you. I purchased it this time so I would have a copy. Richard Bach is one of my all-time favorite authors.
1,"Not a book, but more like a magazine","This was like a kid's first reader for adults. Only about 20 pages, and definately not worth more than a dollar or two.It should be marked more clearly that it's not really a ""book"".I was very disappointed."
2,not much more than a dictionary,"This book is nothing more than what it claims to be, a dictionary. I was hoping it would have little extras, but it doesn't. There's a pronounciation key, English/Kurdish, and Kurdish/English. If you look up a word in English, you'll find one or sometimes many translations in Kurdish, and you don't know which one is the most appropriate. Also, I would like more than the English word that is the ""closest match""; I'd like the meaning of the Kurdish words. Finally, it is far from thorough. Many simple English words just aren't there. This book would be good to have if you were traveling through Kurdistan and could refer to the book for a word or two here and there. But in terms of forming sentences or conjugating verbs, this dictionary is pretty useless. I wish I had spent the extra money and ordered an expensive text book."
2,about population of kurds,on the cover of the dictionary it says population of kurds are 5 million that is not true correct one is about 40 millionthank you
4,Noone can remix like a Bad Boy mix,I got this album its first day and enjoy every song. Probably the hottest being the Biggie mix follow by the mix with 112 and I Need A Girl part 2. P. Diddy got those mixes that make you move around and you gotta feel it. If you're feelin' P.Diddy's new stuff than get it. Its phat.
1,Here we go again...,"P. Diddy, Puff Wussie, whatever his stupid name is, has once again turned out an album that make even the most hardcore Diddy fans cringe. First off, they DID NOT invent the remix, all they did on this album was steal tracks from well-known and TRUE artists. If you think I'm hating on him, well, I am, and I have a good reason to do it. Just like his previous album, The Saga Continues, he bites other rappers' styles (not to mention paying people to write his rhymes!), and he continues to commercialize and fake rap music. What was once a genre of music full of talent, ambition, feeling, and passion is now being corrupted by insincere losers who only care about making money so they can turn out even more of their poorly made music. Diddy's rhymes are even more corny on this album than those on his previous album, The Saga Continues. Eminem's newest album promptly bumped this record off the charts, further showing that it is only a matter of time before Diddy's luck runs out."
4,Nice Stuff,"The selection of songs is good, the fact that need a girl part 2 comes before part 1 is because part 2 is just a better song, still i do agree it is quite dumb..! What i feel is more dumb is the comment below of some girl called Katerina... omg.. laughing my head off at her comments, ""Maybe if P.Diddy saw this"".. ""Could i have this number""... ""Im 13"".. ""I just want a record deal"", truley degrading intelligence in the US, oh well, when us Europeans dominate the world ull see..."
3,IT'S OK,"THIS ALBUM IS OK IF YOU LIKE R&B AND POP. IF YOU WANT REAL HIP HOP FLAVA, CHECK OUT THE ALBUM NATURAL BORN KILLA'S VOL.1 IT HAS ALL THE RAP YOU NEED INCLUDING NEW FLAVA FROM CORMEGA, TRAUM, NASHAWN AND HALF A MILL. IT'S WELL WORTH THE MONEY."
1,P-DIDDY: Business Savy doesn't Mean Music Savy!!,"I'll Give P-Money His Business Props because He pulled a Number 1 Album out of this but as far as Making Music goes??? Nope!Nope!Nope!! He is still doing the same tricks finding Biggie on tracks&that isn't funny.Loon is His Up-dated Mase&well that isn't a Good thing.Usher&Ginuwine kinda Cancel each other as Vocalists to me overall.""I need a Girl"" is a Catchy Song&a easy Sell.but that's all I will say on the Puffy front.He didn't Invent any Re-Mixes if anything He made them Worse.it's such a Shame that... Artist's Like Him are treated as If He is doing something special?? He isn't any kind of a Producer.Ghost Writers&jacking 80's Hits are His Main-stay.but He has the Business Savy to hang in there.He is one of the Reasons Why to Me Rap/Hip-Hop is in the Sorry State it's in nowadays.No Edge what so ever just another Karoke Act getting over.but at the end of the day it's Business as usual I Guess??"
1,utter pap,"Why does p diddy think he's someone he's not? Why do people continue to buy his records? stay away from, go buy some real music instead of contributing to the bulge of ""diddy's"" already fatter-than-they-should-be pockets.0 stars"
2,I Invented Remix,"Sean Combs did not invent remix, I did or perhaps you did, but certainly not Sean aka P. Diddy, aka Puff Daddy. The claim is so ridiculous that only an egomaniac would make such. And, there is nothing on this album to confirm his claim. Most of the tracks range from lame to pedestrian and certainly do not exhibit any originality.Sean thinks he created the first remixes during 1991. That claim alone should be enough warning to avoid this pathetic compilation. I predict Sean next will claim inventing the drum machine and hip-hop. There is an old adage that if you tell a lie enough times, most people will believe it. Obviously, Sean believes his own lies and this album is proof.Bottom line: this is boring."
3,Nothing but Heat,"Don't listen to the other reviwers on this site, if you enjoy remix's and enjoy the work of Puff then you'll like this CD. Diddy has been doing hot remix's since his day at uptown. The Real Love remix which introduced us to a young Biggie Smalls is a classic. Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs isn't your standard remixer. He doesn't just alter the beats of his songs; he re-writes his songs -- new beats, new vocalists, new lyrics, new everything. Of course, Combs doesn't actually do this himself. Rather, he outsources the work to his roster of producers (the Hit Men) and some of the biggest names in urban music. Stand out songs on this on include I Need A Girl Parts 1 & 2, Special Delivery and Dance With Me b/w Peaches & Cream. While I would've remixed Peachers & Cream into a slow jam this is still another catchy album from the Bad Boy Camp."
2,It was alright,"Puff daddy, sorry ""P. DIDDY"" did invent the remix. However, there are about three good songs on this cd. However, the beats to most of these songs were sampled. His statement saying he is original because of his remixes is wrong, because the beats to most of these songs were sampled from older brake beats. So his idea of the remix is original, but his beats aren't."
4,Okay but not the best remixes out there,"this is okay but we all heard this before special delivery sounds just the same just this one has ghostface, craig mack, and keith murray on there. And I don't see why P diddy put out some extra stuff on biggie, the cd does'nt need biggie to sell there's even a remix with him and ashanti doing unfoolish the song appears twice on her cd. But if you feel faith, mary j blige, g dep, busta, missy, snoop and black rob man you should get this nothing that really make me wanna bump it nonstop but worth a listen."
1,Inventor is to blame for the death of pop!,"The Remix...Oh, the fabled remix.What true talent must it take to steal a little from someone and little from someone else...and walk (strut) with pride for giving the old-schooler's their ""props"". If P-Diddy wants to take credit for the lack of originality in music the last few years, let him! Pop music is already filled (and has been filled) with dancers and bums yelling, ""remix"" and stinking up the airwaves. Maybe it's the [people] out there starving for anything radio stations play, but it's who's feeding them which is truly to blame."
3,They didnt invent the remix,"No please dont believe that P Diddy invented the remix. Remixing first appeared in Jamaica in the 1960s, through King Tubby and Lee Perry, although it is difficult to pin down the actual creator, it definitely wasnt P. Diddy. The title alone is a bit much when he states that. I was dissappointed that P Diddy's best remix wasnt featured. Method Man and Mary J Blige ""Youre All I Need"". That is a good one. I dont think he will ever be able to out do it."
4,3285 Bible Questions and Answers,"If you like trivia, this is the book for you! I enjoy trying to answer the questions and looking up the references to the bible. It is a fun way to get more familiar with your bible and you learn something while you are at it, too!! Try it out."
4,full of info,Christianity is one of the world's main religions. This book teaches young people more about the religion. It starts with an introduction then goes on to Jesus and his life and death. It also covers holidays such as Easter and Christmas.The book layout was easy to navigate. The full color photos made the information interesting to learn about.This book is really informative and easy to understand.
5,Best Halloween movie ever,"It's a crime that Spaced Invaders hasn't received a Blu-Ray release, this DVD is an excellent value at least for what is hands-down the greatest Halloween movie EVAR!"
4,Spaced out!,Love that it has Spaced Invaders! I have been lokoing for this movie for some time. So glad to find it at a good price!
1,needed to return,"Battery needed to be returned. When item received, the packaging had been previously cut open and resealed with tape. The plastic housing on the battery was cracked."
1,"Drivel, pure and commercial.","M. Z. B. wrote a seminal book in The Mists Of Avalon. Well researched, well written, and utterly absorbing. The whole book hangs together as a complex tale covering three generations, don't read it once, read it three times. The Forest House is a prequel leading nowhere. A promising beginning, a middling middle,... and no ending, it just sorts of tails off... The last page is not a disappointment, it's a relief - and thank the Goddess that I read The Mists Of Avalon first. I can't help feeling that this book, and others she has written in the same vein, lack the passion, the vision, and are only written with one thing in mind, to milk the market after a truly brilliant novel. Read Mists Of Avalon first and avoid all her other offerings or risk disappointment."
3,Well...not as good as I was expecting,"I've read just about everything mzb wrote, including ""Mists of Avalon"", and was thrilled to find this prequel to Mists. BUT while I wasn't totally disappointed, and I really enjoyed the first chapters, as the book progressed I found the characters harder to sympathize with. I can understand why people are forced to make really hard choices in life, but these characters never ever seemed convinced that these choices were the right ones - and I was never convinced of the Goddess' presence like I was in ""Mists"". I am a fan of Roman culture and was pleased with that aspect of the novel. However, I find myself ready to go back and read it again and see if there was something I missed the first time, because there was certainly something missing.."
2,Ooof! Weak and Melodramatic,"Now I have read The Forest House three times to be certain I would give it a judicious review. In the end, I have to dismiss this book as a try on MZB's part to simulate a romance novel. Instead of subtlety I found moments of melodrama. The central romance was boring because Eilan and Gaius were boring (and wishy-washy and conceited and totally without a clue and...and...) I can't stand books in which the characters think themselves the center of the universe, and Forest House is full of these. On a smaller note, I found MZB's rendition of the Celtic Samhain into Samaine very amusing and indicative of the care with which this book was written. To top it off, this isn't even an original story--it's an interpretation of the opera Norma. Read if you must, but you might find having a grain of salt and good humor to be assets. For me personally The Forest House is too full of the ridiculous to affect me any more than with a sour stomach."
1,Forest House by Marion Zimmer Bradley,"After reaDINg Mists of Avalon and Swords of Avalon, this was very boring reading and a waste of my time and monry."
3,a little disappointing,"I didn't find this as intriguing or thought provoking as the Mysts of Avalon. I found myself wanting the book to finish rather than wanting to read more and more, as I did with the Mysts of Avalon."
3,Okay,"This was an okay book, not her best. It is about the period where christianity was moving into Britian and pushing out the pagan ways. You would probably enjoy this book if you like tales of King Arthur. It has a lot of woman's lib struggles in the plot."
4,Excellent Book,"This book was excellent and though not as completely wonderul as ""The Mists of Avalon"" it was still very enjoyable... Bradley has become one of my most beloved authors! I cannot wait to finish ""The Lady of Avalon"""
3,A good book - historically interesting but at times too long,"""The Forest House"" (or ""The Forests of Avalon"") is a good book, no doubt - but it is not as good as ""The Mists Of Avalon"", by any means. The book is too long compaired to the content of the story, but it is written very well - if not as good as ""The Mists..."". The characters are very well described, but not always totally realistic. The force of the book is the historical facts about the Roman occupation, and it gives a new perspective to ""The Mists..."" because the celtic religion is described. Also, a lot of information about the religious background of the characters in ""The Mists..."" is given. Should be read if you liked ""The Mists..."".I post this again to get it linked to my memberpage."
2,20th century feminism invades Roman England,"In the Mists of Avalon, Ms Bradley had an established story to weave an beautiful, intricate plot around. In this book, freed from any historical (or mythological) plot, Ms Bradley writes a feminist, revisionist story of Roman England. Here all the women are wistful long suffering philosophers or harridan revolutionaries and all of the men are boarish, ignorant louts whose sole purpose is to make the lives of the women miserable.The Mists of Avalon was a great book. This is dreadful feminist tripe. What a disappointment. It shows a lot more about where Ms. Bradley's head is at than anything else."
4,"A story rich in magic, but no ""Mists of Avalon""","I liked this book very much, although it could never reach the hights of ""Mists of Avalon"". The book is highly readable, and grips the reader tightly in a ""Marion Zimmer Bradley"" kind of way. Also, if you are interested in Druidic legends and story, you'll love this book. If you haven't read anything from this author, I'd recommend ""Mists of Avalon"", since that is the one of the best books I've read, and I've read a lot. The Forest House is a Very good book, although not an excelent book."
4,Go estrogen go!,"The set up-- that a young Druid Priestess shares a forbidden love with a half-breed Roman soldier that threatens to destroy both their worlds-- promises gory battles, love scenes, triumphs and tragedy. Marion Zimmer Bradley delivers all in spades. Focusing primarily on the females characters, she does a great job of arcing the main character, Eilan from care-free child to Warrior-Priestess. Zimmer Bradley gives us an interesting, extremely dense story that mixes action, magic and romance into a female-empowering tale. The characters are fairly sympathetic, especially when suffering frustrated love pangs, and thesub plots are just as intriguing as the main story line.Though the story sometimes strays too much into Female Empowerment Land (thanks to chapters devoted to menstrual blood rites and spell casting), Forest House presents lots of cliffhangers and surprises. MUCH better than its sequel, LADY OF AVALON."
4,The Forest House,"A faster read than ""Mists of Avalon"" and less depth of story/character, but all in all the ending was a wonderful payoff. The characters were fairly well-developed, some more than others, but interesting contrasts of character were an interesting part of the story-line. A different perspective on that period of history and a welcome addition to the literature."
3,Not her best work,"After reading the Mists of Avalon, I eagerly anticipated another opportunity to get lost in a Marion Zimmer Bradley novel. Instead, I found the characters introduced too quickly with little background development. It was truly a struggle not to put the book back on the shelf and begin another. Finally, I found a bit of interest in the two main characters Eilan and Gauis. However, I never truly cared what happened to either of them. Chapter 23, involving Gauis, was so dull that I skipped 5-6 pages and the story continued as if they were not needed.The only satisfaction I found in the novel was the story line of Caillean and the introduction of Avalon. I own The Lady of Avalon and The Priestess of Avalon, so I'm not ready to bid farewell to the works of Marion Zimmer Bradley based on this one book. I wonder, however, if the next segment in the story line could have summized this entire ""history"" in a single chapter and moved on."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"Again, too dull to finish. Perhaps it has something to do with it trying to connect to The Mists of Avalon, but being completely different, and just two characters that have been created to have a romance, a Roman, and one of the priestesses of the local religion. If you like that sort of Tristan and Isolde thing, then this may well be for you."
3,"Um, boring!","One of my very favorite books is THE MISTS OF AVALON, so naturally, I thought that this novel would be just as good. Nope. Oh, the writing is still flawless; MZB is an excellent author. The problem is the story. I found it to be lacking in depth and life. The characters were dull and unreal. They never came to life for me. Oh well. No one is perfect. I will still recommend the book to anyone who has read MISTS, because the books are sisters, but just don't expect the same magic."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This was truly a disappointment. Mists of Avalon was one of the first books I read on the King Arthur myths, and I loved that book. This one is way beyond dull - difficult to finish. Mists is so chocked full of excitement and plot, with good and evil, the characters kept me riveted. Go straight to that book and pass on this one.(...)"
2,Disappointing after The Mists Of Avalon,"By the time I read this, I had read Mists of Avalon at least three times. This was such a dsappointment by comparison. I found whole passages tedious and over-blown in a melodramatic, soap-operish way. Bradley had such a phenomenal success with Mists, this reads as if she was cashing in."
2,incredibly disappointing,"I guess the book seemed doubly worse because I've read THE MISTS OF AVALON. This book, although it has a good storyline and is historically accurate, was so dull. T\In THE FOREST HOUSE, the characters were dead, and well, everything else was too. I wasn't convinced of anything, like the emotions of the characters, the Goddess, the chain of events... I did enjoy the ending (Caillean was my favorite character) but it's not worth suffering through the boring book to get to Afallon."
2,This was NO Mists of Avalon!,"I will admit that the task of following up the engagingand enlightening Mists of Avalon was a daunting one. Infact, if I hadn't read ""Mists"", I might have reallyenjoyed Forest House. Well, I was familiar with the magicZimmer Bradley is capable of working, and frankly, she fallsshort in this prequel. It seemed to me that Zimmer Bradleywas more interested in showing off historical research onRoman Britain than in writing a gripping story. The maincharacters are difficult to like. Overall, the book leftme feeling rather depressed and frustrated. Don't expectthe wonder of ""Mists"". You won't find it."
1,"All fans of The Mists of Avalon,stay away from this book!","I read the Mists of Avalon,thought it was wonderful,and then I was overjoyed to see that Marion Zimmer Bradley had written 2 prequels.After reading the Forest House,this was not the case.This was an awful,awful book.The characters were not believable or realistic.By the end of the Mists of Avalon,I cared so much about what happened to the charachters that I was sad to see the book end.With the Forest House this was not the case when many of the main charachters died,I couln't have cared less.The story just didn't draw you in like a good story should.So.I repeat again,for all the fans of the Mists of Avalon,don't bother wating your time or your money on this horrible book!"
5,A Definite Must for Mists of Avalon Lovers,"Bradley is a literary master, as is demonstrated by all of her Avalon works. The tales grab hold of the reader and suck you into Avalon with the characters. The Forest House is another example of Bradley's vast story-telling abilities."
3,"A good book - historical interesting, but too long at times.","""The Forest House"" (or ""The Forests of Avalon"") is a good book, no doubt - but it is not as good as ""The Mists Of Avalon"", by any means. The book is too long compaired to the content of the story, but it is written very well - if not as good as ""The Mists..."". The characters are very well described, but not always totally realistic. The force of the book is the historical facts about the Roman occupation, and it gives a new perspective to ""The Mists..."" because the celtic religion is described. Also, a lot of information about the religious background of the characters in ""The Mists..."" is given. Should be read if you liked ""The Mists..."". (P.S. I'm sory that my english isn't perfect.)"
3,mixed feelings,"mists of avalon was one of the first fantasy novels i ever read and has become one of my favorite books so when i found this one i immediately jumped at it. this prequel to mists is a great stories with wonderful characters but some of the elements of the plot are unbelievable and a little convoluted.the story of girl chosen to be the priestess in roman britain who falls in love with a roman soldier and it all flows from there. but if you are looking for a passionate romance novel look elsewhere, because while there is love there is more suffering and deceit and the couple are only in a few chapters together.while i loved this book for the beautiful story it is a little akward and definetly does not measure up to mists. but if you plan to read mists or the priestess of avalon which is the next book in this remarkable series you must read this to follow these amazing characters."
2,"Sadly, no MISTS here","Like many, I really enjoyed THE MISTS OF AVALON. Unfortunately, THE FOREST HOUSE did nothing for me. The characters, the story -- nothing really gripped me. In fact, I remember getting fidgety waiting for something compelling to happen"
3,A little underwhelming at points,"This book is in the same vein as the other Avalon books, with some compelling characters and an interesting opera adaption for the plot. On the whole, however, I was disappointed with the quality of the book. While some sections were fine, there were some that are simply the result of bad editing and poor writing. The initial passages of the book in particular seem overly contrived. Thankfully, the book improves the further the story progresses. If you like Marion Zimmer Bradley, you will likely enjoy this, but if you're new to her, start off with a better example of her work."
5,Definitely a keeper.,"This book is more than I ever expected; the honest, investigative research style of Pierre will turn any ""skeptic"" into a believer in the existence of angels. His bibliography and ""permissions list"" were also worth the price of the book; they opened up a new world for me. I sincerely hope he will write another book. Thanks to Amazon for making these 5 star books available used."
3,"A decent book, but it strays widely from its title","This book seem to focus far more on two other topics, NDEs (near death experiences) and saints, than it does on its title subject of angels. The whole angel theme seems in fact to be kind of an incidental inclusion, like a thread of only secondary importance. The tenuous angel theme thread ties the other two themes together, themes which form the actual substance of the book.I would recommend this book to those interested in NDEs; I would also recommend this book to those who are interested in the mortification, stigmatic, and pain aspects of Catholicism, which are dwelled on quite extensively in this book. I'd also recommend this book to anyone interested in saints. But to someone purely interested in angels, I regret I have to advise you to look elsewhere for real substance on that subject."
1,Didn't Work-Rip Off,"Tried to get this to work. Only worked on Weekend and had a lot of ""Technical Difficulties"" that were at X-Box Live, not in my home. Tried to get our money back, but they would not. WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Simple as Pie,Great product only slight problem was getting the top to snap in but with help from my 2 friends we popped it right in.
2,floopy and poor construction,Difficult to put together material not rigid enough almost bent in half. Top hinge impossible got two ends to connect but not the center hing.Should keep the snow out though. Would not buy another of their products.
3,Squirrel food,"Nice box to start with but it did not survive the winter, squirrels attacked it and ate it. Other then that it worked ok, not great but ok. It was a little flimsy, but nothing major."
3,OK but Keter is better,"I bought one of these because I needed a slightly smaller (73 gallon) box. I also bought 2 of the 132 gal Keter boxes. Although this is a ""good"" box, the Keter is an excellent box. The Keter in comparison is slightly stiffer, sturdier, and although both boxes snap together, the Keter has a 4 easy to install screws for added strength. The keter box also came with hydraulic lid lifters which are of good quality (I was surprised). Both boxes keep out rain water, but are not sealed so any moisture inside can get out. The Suncast box had wheels which I don't use. The Ketter didn't. I ordered my Suncast box via walmart site to store for $65 and got the Keter at Sams for 99 dollars. The lid on the Keter ""snaps"" shut in case of wind, the Suncast lid just lies there."
4,"Good Box, Bad Instructions","This storage box is perfect for my deck and appears to be good quality for the price. I purchased two. The first one went together fine, but the second one was a problem because I had the base on wrong (not upside down, but should have been rotated 180) and had to break some of the tabs to get the thing apart to fix it properly. Be careful when you put this together, you have a 50/50 chance to get it right. Look carefully before you snap the pieces together. Enjoy."
5,Suncast outdoor storage box,"Xlnt. product,easy to assembleI use it for storing fire wood.I now have two,the first one ,I purchased a few years ago, and has held up great."
3,Very hard to put together,"Not sure if it is due to the weather, but it is hard to put together. You got 6 pieces, with snap to contact them together. Not sure if it was due to cold weather (November), but we had a hard time to put together. The board is very long and the snap is very small... We did manage to put together, but they are not seal perfectly. It is a great utility, but I just wish they can make a better design..."
3,To add to James T. August 9 review,"I only gave three stars because,After I finally got it together the lid did not fit snug and kept popping open even after I had gone over all of the fittings.I put a heavy flower pot on top of it for a few weeks and that seemed to do the trick.Also, last week we had severe wind and rain and the top popped open and all of the pillows inside were soaked! I now have to figure out how to add a latch.On a positive note it is large enough for my large Martha Stuart patio single seat cushions (not loveseat cushion) which must be fit in a certain way and it keeps them dry under non severe wind and rain.It provides perfect extra seating on the patio."
4,Covers ground not found in most BJJ classes,"As a recently minted White Belt in BJJ, having a background in Judo, I was surprised when I was told that takedowns and throws are not taught. Inquiries directed to my Instructor, and further questions posted in various appropriate places on the net, turned up a general consensus that it is not taught until students reach higher ranks, and the primary reason is because of the possibilities of injuries are high. I got the same reaction when I asked about foot locks.This DVD bridges the gap in instruction, and does it well. You may not be allowed to use it in your school, but it may save you in a self defense situation."
5,work fantastic!!!!,Don't know what the one star rating was about. They must have gotten a bad batch. The ones I have work perfectly.
1,I thought these would fasten and lock but they don't,"I am not an electrician but I have no idea how these are useful to anybody. They look like they would pull through the loop, zip to where you want them and lock in place. They don't. The cable just loosely moves back and forth in and out of the loop part. I don't get it. I bought these to attach a board to an antique banister so we could install a baby safety gate. Now they're just going in the recycling."
5,Pure simplicity,Take all of the volumes written about advaita and boil it down to it's essence and wrap it in the clothing of a child's fable and what you get is this book - magnificent!
3,Hot 'n' Sassy,"I had this album/cassette in 1982. Had it stolen and thought I would never be able to obtain it again. Magic Lady is a group of females that remind me of the group, A Taste Of Honey. If you're a music buff, like myself, and like hearing and seeing what ladies can do compared to men, this is your type of album (CD)."
4,Printer cartridge,I have used other than HP original products and have had problems. With the originals I don't. I get between 9500 and 10800 pages from each cartridge. Just wish they where not so expensive.
3,"Fine, but.","Fine, but pricey. Had wanted to plop a 42X into my HP4240n Laserjet, but lo and behold, it does not take them. So you end up having to use these smaller, ultimately more costly ones instead. [So 4240 owners beware, the 42X ones will not work. Have to use this 42A instead.]"
5,Satin Sheets,"Noel Webb is one of the very best electronic violin playes in the business.. His latest CD Satin Sheets is a wonderful blend of the old and new. Sexy, vibrant, and full of life it floods the senses with feeling. I highly recomend this CD to any electric jazz/new age/techno fan..Great music!"
5,Art Underfoot,"Brian Murphy has given us a reverential yet factual account of his journey through the tradition, construction, and marketing of Oriental rugs. His descriptions of the Afgan countryside are heartbreaking, but the converstions with those in the business of dyeing, weaving, and selling rugs are as affecting as they are informative. An old Turkmen saying conveys the essence of their rug tradition: ""Carpets are our soul."" Or, as a young woman says as she completes knotting a section of the rug she is working on, ""It is like a small world all alone and separate: perfect and peaceful."" Murphy explores the debates on authenticity: spontaneous folk art versus commercial product; synthetic dyes versus the natural dyes of the book's title. He does not shrink from showing us the enormous contrasts between the harsh life of the area and the poetic beauty of their rugs. In the end it is clear that he is an unabashed lover of Oriental rugs....and that's not a bad thing. Highly recommended."
5,Another great CD,Another great CD with music from the past. Great for reminising with old friends about the good old days and what now does not play on the radio.
3,DVD not good quality,"First, I LOVE the movie, very fun and very Bollywood. :) However this DVD made by Amazon on demand is not good quality. It does not have a root menu (can't select scenes) and the picture quality overall is not as good as it should be. The transitions between scenes are choppy and one scene that is completely missing. I've seen this movie on 2 other DVDs so I know how the quality should be and what is generally on the standard DVD. 5 stars for the movie, 2 stars for the DVD."
3,Hrithik Roshan in Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon,"I'm a diehard Hrithik Roshan fan, but this movie was just not his best. Once you've seen Dhoom 2 and Jodhaa Ackbar there's no comparison. I would have still purchased the DVD just because I want every movie with him in it."
4,Loved it,I had a copy and someone took my dvd. I was really happy with my copy. I would definitely purchase from them again.
5,Seeking God not the daily chores,How true that when we want more of God we just want to put everything else on hold. Cathy's funny way of helping us laugh at ourselves while learning that God does want more of us and how we can give it to him and have a balance. A very annointed woman of God-Cathy shows you how to get through the daily grind and still come out victorious!
3,workcentre less than average,"When the printer actually works I get amazing photo-quality prints and pictures. The problem is with the print heads. They tend to dry out rapidly and/or get clogged. If you can't unclog them you must keep replacing them at least once a year. The print heads are costly and are not covered by extended warranties - which I purchased for this printer for these kinds of reasons. I feel I did not get my money's worth and for the price of two new print heads, I could have bought a brand new printer and avoided the hassle."
4,Great product!,"I have had this machine for over a year now. It has seen periods of heavy use with periods of a month or more of no use in that time.I have never had a problem with this machine yet. I first used it as a stand alone copier and my copies set at draft to save ink are GREAT! The cartridges last a long time too. I have only had to change the black twice in over a year and I have printed off a lot of copies. You can even photocopy Photos and they come out nearly perfect.For the past 3 months I have had this machine hooked up to my Windows XP system and have been using it to print and copy everything and it is working like a charm with very good quality.The only downside I have found is the scan quality is not up to my standards, so I do no use that feature on this machine. Thus the reason for only 4 stars.All in all, this is a decent machine and an excellent product for the price!"
2,Be careful for what you get,"I used this machina purely as a copy machine, the result is very bad experience. First, xerox told me if had to be used everyday and can't turn it off, just leave it for sleep mode, I don't know about you, but they sound weired. Ok, the problems is that the machine took forever to make a good copy under normal use. I used it occasionally, say a copy here and three days later. Then you have to wait for up to 7-8 of blank pages to come out, before the copier even produce some black ink on the paper. So, you have to clean the head and realign the ink tank. The reason, the prolonged inactivity may clog the print head. Well, I just don't have the need to make a needless copy everyday. My Hp never have this problem.There is design flaurs in this machine. I will never buy anything xerox again."
3,"Great Copier, not to PC friendly","I purchased this Multifunction machine, last August and from the get go, there were problems. There was a communication error with the printer. I followed instructions completely and used the help desk at Xerox (which was a quite pleasant experience) they sent out replacment parts (new cables & ink holders) this did not solve the problem. Out of frustration, I decided to Uninstall the programs, and they would not completely Uninstall. I still have it in my System Setup. However, I proceeded to set it up as a copier only, and it works GREAT! It prints very sharp, true color images, in a timely fashion. B&W prints quick, clean, crisp copies. A big plus for me was their Customer Service, by far the best in my experience."
1,A Lemon,"This machine is a lemon, but it won't matter to potential buyers because Xerox no longer sells it. They no longer have a toll-free phone number for users of home products and email requests for help are returned. (Will only receive email from this domain: XEROX.com). My Workcentre is less than 6 months old and I purchased an extended warranty. After many problems and attempted fixes, my computer won't boot when it's connected. The utility and instructions sent by XEROX don't help. It made my computer settings go haywire, and they could only be restored by disconnecting the Workcentre entirely. I've now been w/o a printer for over a week and have spent much time on long distance phone calls. Since the tech support line has limited hours, I'll have to wait another day to try again. I've been misdirected 3 times and now have a NEW long distance number to try. As of now, problem still has not been resolved. Disappointing (and expensive) all around."
2,Requires enormous patience,"This machine worked okay at first, but then the colors began to streak and fail, and long after the color printing capability died, the machine still occasionally ran out of colored ink. This was a real inconvenience because all I used it for was a B&W copier, scanner, and B&W printer. This past week, it ran out of magenta ink, and now refuses to print, even in black and white. There must be a way to bypass the ink sensor and continue printing in black and white -- does anyone know how to fool it? Yesterday I found that nobody (local) carries those color ink cartridges anymore, so unless I can make it _think_ there's magenta ink, the machine is now USELESS."

5,Great Book,This is an essential ready for anyone living with a domestic partner of either sex. It offers support for those who do not want to get married and those who can not.That and its lots of fun to leave lying around when his mother comes over!
1,A Disappointment To Our Community,"Our friend gave us this book for Hanukah thinking it might help our situation. But it turned out to be a disappointment. We expected it to contain more information about unmarried polyamory. For instance, when one is poly does one keep a spare bedroom...or two? What sorts of problems and awkwardness arise? How do you explain being poly to your grandfather who is skeptical?? The only mention of this subject is a passing reference when the Authors discuss the reasons people choose not to marry. One reason, they say is so-and-so might have more than one partner. The rest of the book consists of boring facts about common law marriage and so forth which can be found in any marriage guide. It appears Solot and Miller are trying to appeal to the mainstream..... This seems like selling out to us."
4,Best Live Band!,"Upbeat, highly-dancable eclectica.Jerry Garcia is dead and the next generation of flower children has dioscovered world music.If you can't see these guys live in concert, this album is the next best thing."
3,Enjoyable tale of growing up & realizing adults are human :),"Obstensibly the story of twins who start a restaurant to keep busy during summer vacation, it's also coping with a father having a mid-life crisis and a brother who isn't as perfect as he seems."
3,It's not what you expect,"I liked the book and it was easy to read it. I couldn't put it down. But this book contains some things that I can't agree with. For example, when girl Lesly (I that was her name) got pregnant she had an abortion. It tells how easy it was and that it was something unimportant. I mean it teaches children wrong thing. It tells how good it is to have sexual affairs before marriage. And many characters in the book just tell how much they want to be sexually involved. All I want to say is that books should contain good morals and values that will be passed on to the next generation."
3,Eggspert Schmeggspert,"This is okay. I am a high school teacher, and had seen this product working with junior high kids. I a room of more than 20 kids, this doesn't work so well. there are only 5 buzzers, and the product DOES NOT come with an outlet adapter, so you have to use batteries to power it.Not only am I disappointed with the product, but also will it's implementation with high schoolers. I thought they would like it (and, initially, they did). However, it is really for junior high kids and below. The smaller the group, the better.ALSO: the remote Eggspert (unattached) does not work, so be forewarned that that is not a viable option, either. The best way to do this type of activity, would be with ""clickers."""
3,Not as described,"The product description states that it comes with an AC adapter...it did not.It also states that the control buttons are on 10 ft cords...they are only approximately 4 ft long.Now I have to buy extension cords and an AC adapter, so I'm not too pleased."
4,every classroom should have eggspert,"since first using it with my language support class i and my students are addicted. i use it is a full class situation as well and the kids love it. it can be used to assess learning in any subject and i will never be without it.the only problem with my eggspert is the wires, i am not happy about all of the wires, we have had a few accidents with either myself or the kids getting caught in them. there is a wireless version available now and i am online now to buy it."
2,Educational Insight Eggspert,"I'm sure this is a good product. However, I returned the product because it didn't come with the adaptor as indicated in the product description."
4,Only one little problem...,"The product overall is great. Easy to use. Seems reasonably durable. The four foot cords are a real downside. The only way they work is if the players are at the same table. Otherwise, extension cords (which come in 8ft and 16ft lengths from RadioShack) are a must if you will be using the product in a classroom or for corporate training (people love it!)."
5,MY STUDENTS AND I LOVE THE EGGSPERT!,My students and I are having a wonderful time playing Math Jeopardy with the Eggspert!!! A+++!
2,Good,Good price does what it is supposed to do grinds well lil expensive but I assumed it would be more sturdy. When I grind other compartment below come undone
5,PERFECT,"I bought this, not expecting anything great for the price, and was amazed how well it worked. One of my buddys has one half this size that doesnt work as good as this one. He spent $40 too. This has a magnetic top so it stays on well, and comes with a little scoop. Can not beat the price- amazing deal. It also has amazing quality, and im very satisfied."
3,Buyer beware,This grinder has an unfinished sharp edge that will cut your fingers whrn trying to open it.I you contact the seller she will blame you for something and act as if you are trying to rob her . Id buy from someone else forget this rude woman and save your skin.
4,"Good product, good seller.","Good solid grinder , feels good on the hand. One of four had issues with the threads of the bottom piece, which is loose."
3,So much fun!,We had so much fun playing this game at my bridal shower. All the different shapes and colors make for a good laugh! I gave this a 3 our of 5 because the penis are not perforated so we had to cut out each individual one right before the party.
4,kind of silly and fun game for bachelorette party,"pretty innocent fun, awkward enough with all the different kinds of penis's, a rainbow one and a rocket, all different little nick names on them. It also suggested that you use them as name tags, which would be fun, we only had a few girls for the party so we had more fun cutting out the dicks than pinning them on. cute, got 2 in the package."
5,New Game fior sure,It adds a new twist on a old game. The girls at a bachorette party had fun with this game.
1,The FifthVial Review,Read this while on vacation. I didn't care for the topic nor for the storyline. I really don't recommend this one.
2,Boring,"I've usually like Michael Palmer's writing, but this book did not keep me interested. There were too many twists and turns, some plausible, some not...In my opinion, not his best work."
2,"Who Talks ""This Way?""","... when facing an imminent prospect of death by the misguided indifferent? Instead of a solemn, contemplative, passionate or a heated exchange between the protagonists when discussing the weighty issue of organ theft, the dialog tends to the lowest common denominator with each character (including highly educated doctors!) seeking to make his or her respective point by being sarcastic with cringe-worthy comebacks.I would have appreciated a more even-handed approach in presenting both sides of the issue to provoke a true examination; instead, the ostensible ""guardians"" are given a short shrift."
4,"Very good, but no big surprise","SPOILER Alert:Maybe I've read too many Michael Palmer books, but this one disappointed me a bit because there was no big surprise or twist at the end (which I've come to expect in Palmer's books). It's pretty obvious that the person who sent Natalie to Brazil in the first place is one of the ""bad guys."" How else would they have known to snatch her at the airport? I hoped I was wrong, because I love a good twist. Oh well.I still enjoyed the book very much. Palmer is a great writer. This just isn't one of his best."
5,Great book that made me mad!,"This book is a must read! I've read all of Michael's books. But the book made me mad...not at Michael but about how this could (and probably does) happen. I won't spill the beans for those of you who have not read it...but when you read it, you'll know what I mean. The book was a very good read. And once I got to the last 50 pages...I broke my rule of not reading novels during the day. I just had to find out what happened. While I was able to put some stuff together as the book went along...I really enjoyed it."
2,Disappointing and predictable,"While the story was entertaining, the plot was completely translucent. I saw the ""surprise ending"" coming after the first few chapters. In fact, I was not surprised at any point in the book. It became a game of waiting for all of the characters to catch up to me, not exactly what you want when reading a thriller. Still, it was a fun read and I enjoyed the higher moral purpose. The writing was fast-paced if not incredibly cheesy at points. But what do you want? I bought it at the supermarket check-out line."
4,Intriguing entertainment,"I enjoyed Michael Palmer's ""The Fifth Vial."" Its pure mystery and entertainment. His medical background shines through so that he can weave a believable tale of technology gone bad in a mercenary world of amoral people. If you have enough money and you need an organ, a secret elite group will make it happen. Never mind how they get the organ!The constant quotes from Plato's Republic got a little pedantic, but since I fly a lot, I ignored them and really got into the book, wondering how it all would fit together. In the end, Palmer gives us a surprise. In short, I was hooked. Keep it up Michael Palmer!Pierce Scranton Jr. M.D.author, Death on the Learning Curve"
4,"Entertaining and Surprising, but not very deep.","The Fifth Vial is split into three different points of view. The different viewpoints come together, and most of the loose ends are tied up at the end. There are twists at every turn, and it brings you to places that are exotic and visually pleasing. While this is not Shakespeare, it is riveting and hard to put down.However, the issue at the heart of the book is organ donation, or organ theft in this case. It's frightening to think of the possibilities, and the motives for stealing organs are well established. After reading The Fifth Vial, I am seriously considering becoming an organ donor.There are several cracks in structure and some questionable turns in the story, but for an entertaining medical thriller/mystery, it's hard to do much better. If it weren't for the focus on organ transplants, this book would make a great movie."
3,Not what you would expect from Michael Palmer,"If you are expecting to sit down with this book for a real medical thrill ride,like his other books, you won't be happy with this one. Stick to his earlier books."
2,I was SO disappointed....,"I had high hopes when I heard this book advertised, because I love medical thrillers (i.e. Robin Cook type); so I eagerly picked this up at the library.What a disappointment!Not only is the dialogue quite lame in many areas, and the characters do some exceedingly stupid things, but I also have a hard time believing this was written by someone who is an M.D., given the preposterous ending!Instead of being spellbinding, as I had hoped, instead I would find myself putting the book down in disgust at times, saying out loud ""Oh - come on! This is ridiculous!""The forced ""romance"" between two major characters near the end was out-of-place and riddled with stilted, silly dialogue. The constant references to Plato, as well, just got dull by the end.I can't believe I read the whole thing.This was the first Michael Palmer book I have ever read, and most likely will be the last. I was glad I checked it out from the library first, instead of purchasing it."
2,Unsophisticated,"Simple, unsophisticated read, of the kind that tells you what will happen, then walks you through the happening, followed by an explanation of what had occurred.The story is unimaginative (human organ harvesting administered by an evil council of scientists). If you are interested in medical thrillers, try Daniel Kalla and his 'Blood Lies'."
3,Farfetched,"I have read all of Michael Palmer's books and this one is by far the worst. As a phlebotomist, I thought it was a bit farfetched to think that when your blood is drawn, it's sent away for tissue typing to serve as a donor list for black market organ sellers. The Fifth Vial chronicles several people's quests to determine the truth about this black market. This thriller weaves through several continents, secret societies, medical jargon, and terrorism.I just thought that the addition of Chicago private detective Ben Callahan was just added as filler. He didn't add anything to the story.If you're intent on reading all of Michael Palmer's books, then read it. But if you're looking for a good medical thriller, skip it."
5,One of Palmer's Best,"I started reading the fifth vial in the waiting lounge of DFW airport in Dallas. I finished it five hours later as my plane touched-down in Eugene, Oregon. I just couldn't put it down. This is a wonderful, fast-paced thriller, and one of Michael Palmer's best efforts yet. The story is torn right off the front pages and Palmer takes us on a scary ride into our own futures. The story could certainly be real; the characters are so deftly crafted that they seem to be as well. I highly recommend ""The Fifth Vial"" to any lover of mystery or thriller novels. It is an exciting, enjoyable and educational read."
2,rinsing it abit,"It seems that the Soledad Bros are rinsing the White Stripes new fame and squeezing it through, barely. This album is ok at best and after you first hear it, will probably sit for a while. It's that Detroit ""garage"" blues rock and that's ok, just not a great album and not that rockin. You'll see dust on it after a month."
1,It's BLUES Night at TGIF!!!!!!,"See above; customers who bought this title also bought: anything from Detroit...this is really funny, funny stuff. Everyone who fell head over heels in love with the White Stripes feels obligated to claim this band as well as any other from the Motor City. Jon Spencer is Mississippi Fred McDowll next to this stuff. If I were a Soledad Brother I'd be in serious fear of Charlie Patton rising from the grave to take vengeance. Look for this one in used bins when everyone gets over the whole Detroit thing."
1,I saw them live....,...and they were nothing to write home about. The set started out promising and then was a torture to endure.
4,Ideal for client/server development in C,"I learned a lot about client/server communication reading this book. It must be noted, however, that some of it is getting outdated now (8/1998): Windows NT 3.5 is replaced by NT 4, C is replaced by C++ and Java, Networking classes can be bought in a class library. I recommend this book to people who want to understand the fundamentals. Chapters I liked most: How to build DLLs, how to build an NT service, explanation of process-to-process communication."
1,Worst Battery Ever- Even worst is the suppoert from sakar,"This battery does not even last half the duration of the original stock battery.Called up Sakar support and was on hold for 75 min.They want me to send the battery in, and it seems that it will take them 1 week to diagonize the issue. The 5 year limited warranty covers nothing.So much so for an international company.Not buying again from them."
5,Works with C-5000,I bought this as a backup battery for my Olympus C-5000. It was the cheapest on Amazon and had the highest advertised mAh. The specs that came with it say it has a lifetime of 500 charge cycles while the Olympus brand says 300 charge cycles. I don't know how accurate any of that is but the battery works in my camera so I'm happy.
2,Careful for bait and switch...,"Much like the prior comment, I ordered this battery and did NOT get a 1300mah battery... I was sent a 1200mah battery. When I complained, I was told that there was a comment somewhere on this page that informed us that it was a 1200 battery. Do you see anything?Delivery was snappy, email were good at keeping me informed on the order... but don't buy unless you want a 1200mah battery."
3,Worked... for a while,"Used in Lumix digital camera. These worked OK for a while and provided almost as many pictures as the Panasonic battery that came with the camera. Longevity is far inferior to the name brand battery, however. After about a year of use,they wouldn't keep much of a charge and I needed to replace them. I'm still using the Panasonic battery."
1,Didn't last long,I bought this as a backup for the original battery that came with the camera and the original one is still going strong while this battery won't hold a charge any longer. I wouldn't buy this brand again.
2,Does not hold charge well,"This is okay for regular pictures, but as soon as the flash is involved, the charge goes down so fast you can only take 2 or 3 pictures with the flash before you're out. Also, it doesn't hold charge well when it's not being used.I'm using this with an Olympus C-765UZ.I would not recommend this battery. Go with the OEM Olympus/Sanyo battery instead."
1,Digital Concepts /FAIL/ again,"Like all products from this company, this is a poor quality knockoff of a fine product that simply does not work. This battery would simply not hold a charge under any circumstance. I'd give it a full charge, slap it in my C-765 Oly and just an hour later... with the camera off, there'd be no charge on the brand new battery.Buy anything else, from any one else."
4,Excellent but...,"Firstly, I should state that I knew very little about the Mughals which is why I bought this DVD. I agree with the others who gave this film 4- and 5-stars. However, there is a negative no one has pointed out yet, so I will.For some of the battle scenes the History Channel used the same kind of cheesy CGI that was used for Decisive Battles of the Ancient World. But this is just a quibble. It's entertaining. It's informative. Buy it. You won't be sorry."
3,overall impression,Not what I exactly thought it would be. Considered to be a bit short on the history of the dynasty and focussed more on the militaristic feats. A bit of a disappointment to someone who is reasonably well versed with the history of India.
1,An Attack to Humanity,"The very things that makes us what we are, Humans, is completely and utterly attacked by this work. ""Hitler in a Nutshell"" could very well be the name for this book.Our singularities, frailties, our physicalities, emotions, make each of us what we are. All of the propositions put forward by the Author to why cloning is a feasible science are card castles quickly blown away by the winds of true science...The most successful cloning to date, the photogenic sheep Molly, suffers from a range of illnesses, how do they dare to tackle the human genome with such flanboyant attitudes?This book will serve the purposes of those trying to get a glimpse of the Raelian political agenda, but will serve none to the science informed that there is meaningfull purpose with experimenting with human cloning.Another step forward to an ill guided sect, another step back to humanity..."
4,Great buy from Amazon!,Needed this to replace a below deck aluminum tank for my deck boat. No where was there a better deal! This one fit my space perfectly and fittings and sending unit work great !
5,Love it!,"Was so happy to find this after I found they were no longer being sold in stores! My great grand daughter loves it!Fast delivery, and product was as guarenteed!"
5,The romantic Al Green!!,What's not to like about Al Green and his sexy voice! Nothing! I just wish he were still putting out new music. I will never tire of listening to Al Green!
4,Great CD,"Pretty much all of Al's hits in one CD. The quality of this CD is very good, a nice addition to my collection"
3,Very Best of Al Green,Great songs but his voice seems somehow weaker or not as powerful. I have the same cassette which is better than in the quality of Al's voice.
3,Sweet voice,"This CD was already open, so I was disappointed that this was not new. Thus it should have been at a discounted price."
4,A great book about God's love!!!!!,Corrine sets out to find her husband and daughter that she abandoned 8 years before. But there is a bitter man that wants to her to pay for her past crimes. This book is great because it demostrates how God could forgive anyone if they repent of their sin. You'll love this book!
2,Went back to SleepMD,"I tried Somesta for only three nights before dumping the rest of the bottle and returning to SleepMD. It may be a great sleep aid for some, but every body reacts differently to drugs/herbs... and mine did not react well to Somesta. Although I fell asleep in less time that with SleepMD, my sleep was anything but restful. My sleep pattern was disrupted and I awoke 5-6 times each night after experiencing bizarre dreams (unnusual for me)."
5,Whisk a beauty!,"Do you like meringues? I like meringues. I like them fluffy. I like whipped cream as well, and I like that fluffy as well. Other whisks have let me down, and leave my meringues flaccid. I want them tumescent! The KitchenAid whisk will have them standing proud. Marvellous."
1,Ok,"The wires on this wisk are too far apart for mixing shallow quantities. OK for deep mixing, though."
2,Waste of time book....,"I have struggled thru several months of off and on reading of this book. This book is not sensual and provacative.....just crude. Save your money and buy ""Sarum""by Edward Ruferdton for true to life sweet relationships. He and Ken Follet never fail to produce a #1 winner you hate to put down!!!"
2,Not much dancing,This was a gift for my 4 year old daughter. She was so excited to use the bar and DVD but that did not last long. The DVD was a little fast for her to understand where her feet were to go. She watched it twice and then that was enough for her. The bar and mat do not match up like another reviewer mentioned. She did have more fun dressing up with friends and playing with the bar without the DVD.
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY,"I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE IT 1 STAR, I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AND THE DVD WAS SEVERLY DAMAGED UPON OPENING IT. I CALLED THE STORE AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD SEVERAL RETURNED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I CALLED SPIN MASTER AND THEY WANTED ME TO PAY TO SEND IT TO THEM AND FILL OUT PAPERWORK WHICH IN TURN WOULD PUT ME ON A WAITING LIST TO GET ONE. THEY ALSO ADVISED ME THEY WOULD NOT START FILLING THE WAITING LIST UNTIL AT LEAST 4-6 WEEKS FROM NOW. WHY SHOULD I BE OUT MORE MONEY FOR THIS TERRIBLE QUALITY TOY. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
4,Very cute addition to our little dancer's room,"Both my 3 year old and nearly 2 year old daughters LOVE this video. Neither can really follow the steps yet but they try. It keeps their attention for nearly the entire 30 minutes!!! I just wish they would make some companion dvd for the bar that comes with it. For me this is great for a kid 3-6 years, 8 years would probably find it a little easy."
1,Seriously Bad,"Santa brought this present for my three year old daughter this past year. Boy, wasn't Santa surprised to find such junk in the box. The bar was junk, the mat was junk, and the DVD was worse than junk!I don't think I could find anything else on TV as bad as this DVD. The music was horrible. It's supposed to be a ballet DVD. Let's try some classical music?? Of all the beautiful young women on the planet, they had to pick this girl?? I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this was definitely the producer's daughter, as she had absolutly no other redeeming qualities. She has a horribly annoying voice, a face that hasn't launched any ships, and no talent for ballet.I have not let my daughter watch the DVD since Christmas week as I just can't stand it. She does run around the house singing bella bella dancerella. But I just put on our Dance with Barbie tape.Don't waste your money! If you decide that you have to have it watch for sales as we got it for $[...]at Target."
2,NOT WORTH THE $$,"DVD WAS SO SCRATCHED - TOTALLY UNWATCHABLE - TOOK FOREVER TO GET IT TO PLAY AT ALL - MY TODDLER ENJOYED IT ONCE ON, BUT THE BAR/MAT TAKES UP TONS OF SPACE, SO MANY BETTER TOYS FOR THIS PRICE RANGE. I THREW IT AWAY AFTER INTITIAL USE AND OF COURSE NOW ""BELLA"" IS HER FAVORITE REQUEST."
4,Basic's of Ballet are here,"My 4 year old recieved this for her birthday last week and I must say, the video is a bit corney from an adults view but for a 4 year old is was entertaining enough to hold her attention for the 30 minutes, as for the bar and the mat they did not match up for some reason, maybe they had a design change and did not completely change everything in the package, the bar on the dvd does look different from the one in the box, my daughter did enjoy the dvd, it covered ONLY the 5 basic ballet positions and nothing really else ballet related, but all in all it was cute and I would recommend it for at home fun and not instead of having your child go to a REAL dance studio for lessons..."
4,"Movie is bad, but she likes it!","We bought this toy for our daughters 3rd birthday. She LOVES LOVES LOVES it. The movie is kind of annoying and low quality, but I hear the family put it out on their own w/out the help of a ""big toy company"". Either way, my daughter loves it and watches it over and over and over. She sets the bar and mat up her self, it's very light weight. Although she can't fallow the steps perfecty, she does watch it and try to move her arms and legs like the little girls on TV. It's really cute. I didn't buy the 17.00 bella matching tutu. I went to target and got one for less then 10$. Ye-ay me!"
1,Please don't waste your money!,"This was a hot toy for xmas 2004. My parents went through hoops getting this for my 5 year old ""ballerina"". I guess the bar and pad were sturdy enough but the movie was terrible. Very poor quality (you think they could have done better for the money) and didn't hold my 5 year old's attention even through the first sitting. She has NEVER asked to see it again. (This is the same girl that has watched every Barbie movie 20 times!) I didn't want to sit thru the movie either - horrible sound and weird costumed people bouncing around (after a lot of talking). Bad."
2,returned it the next day,"For my daughter Julia's fifth birthday I was pleased to have something to suggest to my mother to give to her. Thought Julia would love this, she goes to a weekly dance class. Had heard of it at Christmas time. I also read some positive reviews about it. We opened it up and tried it. Thedvd does have a long introduction and there's not really much to the whole thing. It was too fast for her to follow and she lost interest. She put it on again in the morning herself and told me she wanted to return it. There are just two songs and only the five steps are taught by a sort of annoying host, pretty much a rip off for the price. So, we returned it tonight and for the same price she got 3 toys she's very happy with. All kids are different and the great thing is you can always bring things back."
1,Another horrible Shakespeare production!,"This DVD was so bad that I really can't believe it's been unleashed on the general public (and for $.....). I have bought this production company's Shakespearean videos before, and every time I am disappointed. I just keep hoping one of them will be decent. This was the worst Antony and Cleopatra I have ever seen. The acting is so terrible that in places where a good actor would have you weeping, these actors make you laugh. Although Tomothy Dalton gives an okay performance, the rest of the cast stinks. This is wooden acting at its best. If these actors actually got paid for thier performances, someone should take their money back. To abuse the Shakespearean language as they did should be a crime! This is the kind of productions that make kids hate Shakespeare. Do not buy this video if you have any sense."
1,Dalton talent lost in terrible production,"I love Timothy Dalton. His performance offers what few enjoyable moments there are to be found in this version of Antony and Cleopatra, but it unfortunately cannot salvage this atrocious production. Seeing it is enough to turn someone off Shakespeare. (Should that happen, I highly recommend viewing Al Pacino's delightful LOOKING FOR RICHARD -- it is the perfect antidote to restore passion for the Bard). But I digress. I want to issue a warning to all who might assume this DVD would be superior to its VHS counterpart. In this instance, tape was simply transferred unto disk with no remastering or enhancements, and there are no extra features. The visual and audio quality is appalling. I regret buying this DVD when I already owned the VHS (..like I said, I love Timothy Dalton...) The only advantage is being able to skip the boring parts to get to the monologues. But that isn't saying much."
3,Issue with Mac OS,Fair warning for those considering this for a MacOS machine: this unit DOES require installation of a special driver that may cause problems with other USB Mass Storage devices. There are better products that will still allow multiple cards at once without requiring a special driver; look for those.
5,mazda ngk spark plug wire set,a good fit for my 1996 mazda mx6 6 cylinder . almost 1 year and 10ooo miles later in use and still going strong .
3,"fun, fun, fun!",i bought this for my preschool aged boy. i would not use it if your kid is bringing home books for homework. it is definately a fun way to carry papers to from school. my son loves this.
3,for Kinder and under,"I bought this for my 3rd grade son. This backpack is probably intended for under 6yrs old. I dont recall if it stated that onthe descrition. It is a smaller backpack, with not much room. The lunchbox is also smaller than most lunch sacks."
4,"a meeting of the minds, somewhere in space","This is a dangerous disc. The Funkadelic tunes are grounded by a bone numbing bass & the outside R&B of Vandermark's tenor. While they don't take the tunes out to the furthest limits, the terrain that they do travel is true. On the Ra tunes the playing is quite nice, & a little more of Vandermark's heart is exposed. Looking at some of the other discs that get 5 stars here, this one probably should too; however, this is a true 4 star recording: very, very good, with fine playing & a beautiful concept brought to fruition."
4,I enjoyed every page.,There are few finer story tellers than Plimpton. This is one of his best and funniest works. Some remarkable stories.
3,"Relentless, but lacking somewhat","I give stellar kart major props for sticking to their style from start to finish on All Gas. No Break. Never once did I feel like one song here didn't fit with their whole pop-punk/emo style. With that said, though, alot of the material here sounds underproduced. ""Student Driver"" could have had a better chorus, ""Livin' on a prayer"" isn't really needed, ""Love song"" is bad lyrically, ""Tree climber"" is too short and ""gone fishin"" has no chorus and ends abruptly.If you like (old) TSL or Relient K, you'll like Stellar Kart."
4,I'm not a good tree climber!,"I never heard of Stellar Kart until the local Christain radio station played ""Spending Time With You"" on the airwaves. The next day I bought the album not knowing whats inside. My first impression is that they sound like many of the emo bands out there, pop punk and high energy and catchy. Then I started to listen to the meaning and abliliy of their work and I am impress. They are more than just a emo/christian/punk/pop band.Ratings:1)Student Driver - catchy and fast pace (4/5)2)Second Chances - (4/5)3)Come Back Home - (3/5)4)Spending Time - First single, catchy and great hook (5/5)5)Livin' On A Prayer - cover of Bon Jovi's song (5/5)6)Love Song (4/5)7)Superstar - (3/5)8)Life Is Good - (5/5)9)Tree Climber - short, sounds like a rehearsal song (3/5)10)Gone Fishin' - ehh (2/5)11)Finish Last - great meaning, upbeat, my favorite (5/5)"
1,WHY???,"I just couldn't stand this album. They sound like a billion other bands except 100 times worse. I don't see why people would listen to it. There are so many other good christian bands out there. For example my favorite band MxPx. Supertones, Five Iron Frenzy, Calibretto 13, Craig's Brother, Roper, and even Relient K is better.I, unfortunately, have seen them live. They opened for Supertones. They do not put on a good show.About the cd. It just has no originality. It would be much better if they did something new, not something everyone has heard a billion times before.You should not buy this cd, I recomend buying any MxPx cds. They are amazing."
1,Arrived dead...lost 2 weeks of boating,"Took off my old fuel pump...mounted this one, followed instructions exactly. Boat would not start without starting fluid....we did a pressure test and was not flowing fuel...would only allow some through from the vaccum of the engine by revving the boat up....no idle at all.I by passed the unit and wired in an electric fuel pump.....turned the key and she idles like a dream now....too bad i bought this in the off season and sat on it thinking it was a working product.....lost 2 weeks of boating because of it.Maybe your experience will be different....mine was bad!"
1,Fuel pump is sub-standard,"Unfortunately, I did not heed the warning of the prior review. I thought maybe his experience was a fluke. Anyway, bought the pump, installed it, it worked for idle speed and then failed when revving to 2800 rpm. Took boat to a pro boat mechanic. He ran a pressure test on the pump. The new pump was bad. Am returning it for refund. Not sure if this is truly a genuine Sierra part or if Sierra parts are just junk. There were no markings on the pump itself nor on the instructions nor on the box it came in to indicate who it was made by. The only indication of where it was made was a sticker that said made in Taiwan R.O.C.. The box label said assembled in the United States. Very disappointing and wasteful of time and effort."
1,Ouch,I have watched this movie somehow from the beginning to the very end and I have only one comment about it : It was an extremely boring movie that told the story of two young men checking the depths of an unknown river with both legs - by going to Mexico.
1,Why?,"I had high hopes for this film. Good cast, top director, great critical reviews, based on a good book, etc. Even three quarters of the way through I was hoping for a real masterful change of direction. Alas, upon completion I was hit with the reality that this is one bad film. Even the great scenery can't make up for a disjointed and purposeless screenplay. I think the screenwriters took their cues from television show Seinfeld. This is the story about nothing. There is absolutely no point to this film.It concludes where it began with the protagonist no wiser for the experience of being a cowboy, a broncobuster, a love interest, a Mexican prisoner, and a character of questionable decision-making ability --all in a time span of a few months. Sure maybe he proved to be an honest and just individual but so what? He put himself into a situation and place where honor is determined by who has the biggest gun and justice is non-existent, nor can it be expected...."
1,DISSAPOINTED !!!!!,"I am extremely dissapointed. After numerous emails to the seller and no responses to help me with the outcome. I have been charged for the movie by creditcard, but never received it. In tracking it, it had been delivered to an old address of mine, and NOT the one I have on file with Amazon. I let the seller know this several times and he did nothing to see to it that I would get another copy. I paid for it and got NOTHING !! Donot order from this seller. He completely ignored me in getting me help, or seeing that the address that it was delivered to was not even the one I submitted.Dissapointed,Connie"
1,"From Screenwriter To Director, Everyone Asleep At The Wheel!","300 Channels on cable and nothing to watch, so I figured i'd give this one another go. So slow, you get up and start cleaning the house and other things you put off. Billy bob, next time give everyone a strong cup of coffee...or something stronger if you know what I mean. I mean, literally, just putting a camera out on those beautiful vistas and filming a gorgeous herd of horses grazing would be more entertaining than this turkey. Avoid!"
3,Read the Book,"Some stories make good movies, but Cormac M's writing can't be captured on film. Nevertheless, I found this movie an interesting companion to the book, but not as a stand-alone. Not sure BB Thornton is a great director, but I'm no expert. Someone else might have done it better."
1,Not too good.,"I read the book and loved it. The video was a disappointment. I love this author's books, all of them!"
3,Where is the restored director's cut of Billy Bob's film?,"Billy Bob Thornton's original version of ""All the Pretty Horses"" ran nearly four hours. The director's contract gave him final cut rights ONLY if the film came in under two hours. Watching the 112 minute version in the theater it was clear that this film has been hacked up and I eagerly awaited the Director's Cut DVD version that would restore Thornton's vision. Well, boys and girl, this DVD ain't that one. Again we are left with only hints of what might have been regarding the performances of Matt Damon, Henry Thomas and Lucas Black. Certainly Thornton wants us to see his original labor of love, so there must be more legal shenanigans going on behind the scene. The last time I was this disappointed by the DVD version of a film was lame director's cut version of ""The Last of the Mohicans."" Somebody wake me when they get this one right."
2,Hmmm...,"""All the Pretty Horses..."" First of all, the parts of this movie that are in English are hard to understand most of the time, it seems like run-together whispers. But, of course, some of it is in subtitles, so you can understand that easier, but then you miss some parts they actually say (in English) so it doesn't make very much sense.Another reason why it doesn't make sense is because the movie skips around too much, I heard it was cut up alot to fit the theatre version. The acting, though, is exceptionally good, even though it is hard to hear. And the end, well, it just doesn't seem to fit very right because they had to cut some scenes out. But, if you really would like to buy this movie, I reccomend getting it used, ($$$) instead of brand new ($$$). There is a good scene in here, though, when Matt Damon trains the horses in Mexico. Hope that wasn't too brief for y'all, I sometimes get bored reading the rather long reviews! (...)"
4,A really beautiful movie.,"Billy Bob Thornton is just going from streght to strength. All the Pretty Horses is just another nortch in his already extensive belt. His performance in 'A Simple Plan', his script for 'The Gift', his performance in 'Primary Colors', 'Sling Blade' and now this. Poetic film-making. And Penelope Cruz's beauty is unparallelled."
1,"More action with horses, PLEASE!!!!!!!!","This DVD was extremly boring. My mom and I bought it thinking it was going to be full of horses, but it isn't! We are both avid horse lovers and it was a big disapointment. They spend more time with everyone giving each other ""loving"" looks. To sum it up there's too much time spent gazing at each other and not enough spent with horses! Why didn't they just call it ""All the Pretty Women""?"
1,this one's just awful...,"Not much I can say here that hasn't been said by others. ""All the Pretty Horses"" (the book) was one of the best novels to be written in the past 20 years. ""All the Pretty Horses"" (the movie) has been edited to a point where it makes no sense.Also, John Grady and Alejandra are supposed to be 16 and 17 years old, respectively. In a coming-of-age story, that's kind of important. Matt Damon and Penelope Cruz are WAY too old for the roles."
2,Amazon was so right,"Amazon predicted I would rate this movie two and a half stars. Well, no half star is available, so I can only rate it two. I wanted to watch this because I hadn't read the book and I knew the book had garnered important awards. I gave it all the breaks I could, but I wasn't prepared for the many ways the story developed, maybe because the transitions were so sudden. What started out as a cowboy story turned into a romance and then a prison story. Probably in the book, it was not so disjointed. I cut the actors all the slack I could, and wonder if much of the best part didn't end up on the cutting room floor. However, for it to have been any longer would have bored the tears out of the small group who watched it with me. Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up. I can't imagine why. Next time I am going to listen to Amazon predicting my opinion."
2,Slingblade it isn't.,"Wow, this movie was lame. At first I thought it might be good because of the director and the actors, and the beginning of the movie wasn't that bad if you're not real big on good acting. Sometimes a movie doesn't have to have good acting to be a good movie, this movie does not have that luxury. The story was lame and predictable, except for one part of the movie that really surprised me in it's improbability.The only reason that I watched most of this of this was because my girlfriend was awake and I wanted to seem interested in the movie for her. To give this movie it's due, the cinematography was good, but not good enough to keep me interested.I wouldn't recommend this movie, seriously you guys."
1,Dissapointing...,"I actually rented this DVD to watch with my wife who keeps complaining about all the action films i rent that she HATES to watch. It seemed like a simple pleasant romantic drama, and i was looking forward for her thanks and appreciation about what a lovely movie i brought. To my dissapointment she grouchingly went to sleep quite near the ending. I could understand why, the movie is not a romantic drama or anything close, its not even about horses. The film starts telling the story of a teenager cowboy leaving the 1950's Texas for Mexico with his buddy. From then on its just a bunch of events with no focus or meaning. I cant remember any part of the movie I liked, although there are some dark moments in the movie that are emotionally hard to watch. Not an entertaining one, let it go."
4,A sleeper,"Not only did I like the movie, it introduced me to a great writer, Cormac McCarthy. Cormac McCarthy is a modern realist, my American Lit class first brought my attention to this author and the happenstance of picking this movie off the shelf brought a screenplay based on his book to my viewing ""pleasure."" It's an interesting movie, some call it a typical picture, but I was taken in and thought the story superb. Get past the negativity of the reviews here and see it for yourself. Comac McCarthy deserves recognition for his craft. Matt Damon did a respectable job in the effort and Penelope Cruz (Correlli's Mandolin) put her on my radar screen. I liked it, what more can I say. Oh by the way, I thought this was going to be a ""horsey movie"" not a tragedy."
4,Good and Underloved,"Good film. Cowboys may be a little too clean. Mexicans are okay--good, bad.Damon is understated and good. The book was good as well, though did not deserve all the praise it got. (McCarthy's No Country for Old Men is a masterpiece, as is the film.) But the bad hoohah this film got deserves a bad rating, too. Doesn't fit people's stereotypes. They need 'em."
4,Visually intoxicating slow burn ...,"Masterfully crafted adaptation of the novel. A coming of age ""road trip"" on horseback. This period piece set on the Texas / Mexico border of post World War II takes the viewer on a visually intoxicating slow burn of adventure, passion and danger. Fueled by the struggle between duty, loyalty and matters of the heart. Beautiful cinematography underscores warmth and charm of old Mexico as cultural and class differences play out. Powered by an enchanting Marty Stuart soundtrack. Thank you Billy Bob! (Give us MORE on the DVD release, and you'll get five stars!)"
2,Not as good as OEM,"This battery does not work well with the OEM charger. After a few minutes on the charger, the charger throws error codes. Battery doesn't last as long as the OEM battery and seems to lose charge if it sits."
1,Cool little film; lousy DVD release!,"I could hold forth on the relative merits of this DVD's entertainment value--you get to see some weird incarnations of various prominent actors, James Spader looking particularly weird; not that many flicks set in Oklahoma these days; Joanna Going carried the film, etc. etc.--but instead I think I'll criticize the DVD itself. First off, it has exactly ONE ""special feature"" (production stills, at that!). Furthermore, not only does this disc lack the extended cut (missing 3 minutes, this is just the R-rated version), it is also, most pathetically of all, full-frame only. Come on! This is a 2002 release of a **1997** film, and somehow they couldn't manage a widescreen edition. Has the distributor already been repossessed or something? It's DVDs like this that make me doubt for the future of the medium. Get with the program, Artisan!"
3,Unpleasant movie with some wonderful moments,"Maybe it's something about the water in Annapolis, but I too thought Joanna Going was spectacular. Mary Tyler Moore was fun as a nasty mother, too."
2,Who Wants To Be Quentin Tarantino?,"This is another movie that seemed to suffer of the ""Pulp Fiction"" effect, as it pretty much relies on attitude, cool badass characters, stylish cinematography and edgy music to give mood. The story, however, isn`t that great, turning into an average betrayal plot that doesn`t bring nothing new or too memorable, and is a bit too slow. Some good moments still occur, though, and the acting is alright, with talents like Eric Stoltz, James Spader, Mary Tyler Moore and even a then unnoticed Cameron Diaz. So, ""Keys To Tulsa"" is a decent indie movie that`s neither too surprising nor too disappointing, another one to watch at a rainy night."
1,BAD,The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing is James Spader. He is really EXCELLENT!Very choppy shallow story line.
1,don't buy it!,"the story is boring and stupid, the actors act very bad, except Cameron Diaz, but we only see her 5 minutes."
2,Poor quality graphics,"The cover looks like a poor quality photocopy. The Calecottt seal is completely illegible and there are a couple of random color dots. Very disappointing, as the illustrations would be lovely were this a higher quality publication. I know it is not an expensive book, but wanted to warn off anyone who is interested in the art work."
5,Memories,Perfect old timey story for the kids. Brought back wonderful memories for my husband. Illustrations are beautiful. Beats Disney's version my a long mile!!!!!!
2,Suncast Cooler,"I purchased this cooler three years ago. I had no problem with the assembly; it went rather quickly. My problem, however, is that now after three years, the plastic liner cracked in two or three places in the seam of the box. I took very good care of the cooler during the winter months (I live in the Midwest) by storing it inside my home. Now my only recourse is to try and mend the plastic liner or get a new one, if that is even possible."
2,Not worth the money,The concept is good but the material is cheap. The plastic will warp and the doors will not close. Also one good hit and it will shatter. Worth $50? maybe. Worth over $100 - absolutely not. I cannot endorse it for the cost alone. For $100-$125 build something out of wood.
2,save your money,very cheaply made1/2 the cost it would be worth itnot the best buy i have donesave your money
1,Should have been better,"I like the idea of this product, it looks nice and I am sure that it would do what it is claiming to do. However when I received it they sent me two right sides and I was unable to put it together for a christmas gift, plus it looked as though they had just stuffed all the pieces in the box because there was no packing material around it. I am planning on purchasing this item again, however I might find a different way to get it."
4,Suncast Cooler review,Very pleased with the overall quality and functionality of this cooler. Very durable and ecstatically pleasing.
3,Anticipated 2nd story,I bought this book with great anticipation as I had loved Vickie Taylor's first book in this series Carved in Stone. I must say that I was somewhat disappointed. I loved the first book and had found those main characters very strong and fascinating. I was left empty with the main characters of this second book. I just never felt any real spark between them. They both had good strong unique personalities but there was nothing to bring them together. It was almost like they lived in a parallel universe. It was nice to have the characters from the first novel have a strong part in this book and I look forward to the next story about Levi.
3,Waiting on the third installment,"For the style of book this is, it's really quite interesting. The characters are better developed and tied between the books than in some series and I actually have enjoyed the first two books enough that I am looking forward to the third. Certainly not ""great literature"" - but an entertaining afternoon read!"
4,Second Story is Very Sexy!,This second book in the Gargoyle Series is very sexy and suspenseful! The plot of good vs. evil still exists along with the 'myth' of the Gargoyles. Engaging read.
3,"An easy read, not a lot of depth!","I read the first book in this series, Carved in Stone, and I must say it was a better book. This book didn't have a lot of depth to it. The love story was lacking, the characters didn't have a lot of pizzaz, but this is a fast and easy read and fairly entertaining. I will buy the next book, because I have looked forward to finding Rachel's brother, Levi."
5,You go girl.,Bravo! This is one woman who sings deeply from the heart with each and every lovely selection...wonderfully arranged and touchingly performed.
5,"Witty humor I think of everday, I wish I would have written","This book is absolutely hilarious! I am a high school student, and these are things that come into my mind, and many of my friend's minds on a daily basis. All I can say, this is stuff that most of us don't think to put onto paper. I wish I would have written it. But, hey, great job to Amy!"
2,Not That Clever After All,"I really wanted to be heartily entertained by this book. Not having read any prior work by this author I was very hopeful. However, this Seinfield-esque ""brain lint"" just did not translate in print as well as it might have had Jerry and Elaine done an episode based on it. Maybe this type of humor is already getting old - or maybe I am - I just found it neither clever nor all that funny. I kept reading waiting for the funny parts, but feeling instead as if I'd been duped into purchasing something that hadn't required much originality or effort from the author after all. But, perhaps I expected too much having seen all those five stars."
2,Bad movie,The product was in great shape and arrived quickly it is just a lousy boring movie. Thought it would be funny but was just BORING!
3,Fun dark movie,Dark funny movie. Written well and stars worked well with each other. A husband loves his wife though her emotional breakdown.
2,COMEDY???,"I guess if you enjoy laughing at people who are tragically mentally ill, this would be a comedy. The movie is a drama with some moments of comedy. At no time does Lisa Kudrow get on all fours and bark like a dog. Now that I would have paid to see."
3,Important.,"A book with thousands of phrases and words that help even the native speaker. Covers Miranda warnings, high stress situations, speaking about crimes, finding out what happened, and other necessary conversations in a an unknown environment. Everything from citizenship to ""?Cuantos cervezas?"". Lacking in street slang, and verb forms, however."
5,Muy Bueno,It's a great book to jump start your Spanish studies. Service was impeccable. Condition and price of book sensational. Amazon gives you internet greatness. Thanks
1,Horrible book,"I agree with Mr. Picapiedra statments: stay away from this book, it'll make you sound stupid.Now I'm really worried about the justice system in the States as a former reviewer, David Levine says: ""I am beginning to break into conversations, in Spanish, between clients and the court appointed interpreter. I am developing the ability to explain to my clients (albeit simplistically) what is going on in court""MY GOD !!! I really pity Mr. Levine's clients.In a later review Mr. Davidson states he is a Police Officer, and says the book is very good. On the other hand he admits he can't speak spanish.Well, I'm not a police officer, BUT (big *but* here Mr Davidson) spanish is my native language. The book is horrible becouse it has gross *errors*.It's a good idea to write a manual for police officers, but it's a *bad* idea to have errors in it."
4,Dora doll,"I bought it for my nice, she's 4 and she adores this backpack doll. I wouild recommend this product."
5,Dora,"As stated with deigo, Dora was a gift for my three year old neice. She kept repeating I LOVE THIS....The look on her face was priceless..."
3,Cheaply constructed,"This was a present for a little girl. I was disappointed when I received it because it appears to be cheaply made. If I were in the store, I would not have purchased it. Well, not at fourteen dollars (incl tax). Five dollars, yes. The legs looked like they can be easily torn off. She received many Dora/Diego dolls/pillows which were made with stronger material and better sewn compared to this Dora backpack. No, there isn't much space in the back to carry anything but I honestly didn't get it for that reason. I thought it would be cute for her to wear her favorite character on her back.I know there are a lot of positive reviews but for the price I paid, I did not think it was worth it."
5,"Great product, great price","I needed a spare battery for my wife's digital camera, and checked out the local prices for it. Then I went on Amazon and found the same brand/same rating battery for MUCH less. I bought two, and they arrived exactly as advertised. They work great and I would recommend this product to anyone."
3,Something old but still worth to read,This novel is written under the name of Anthony Gray in late 60's.In this time USAF concentrated its effort and resources to the missiles andgetting to abundon its super sonic manned bombers.A RAF general worried about this and planned the mock attack with its Valcanbomber to demonstrate the possibility to penetrate US deffence.
1,Book was horribly disappointing,"I was given this book as a gift on my 30th birthday. I could barely get through it before donating it to Goodwill. It takes a very singular look at turning 30 and being a women. I found the examples to be a bit unrealistic and unable to capture what real women face in their careers, marriage, and family life. It makes assumptions about ""modern"" women and the ""what to do about it"" in the title is quit misleading. Perhaps this book is appropriate for 5% of females."
4,It was a good read,"As someone in her early 30s who is juggling motherhood and an extrmely challenging career, I have not had time to read Glamour or Cosmo so did not realize this topic has been thoroughly discussed as the other reviewers have stated.However, I did enjoy the book. It was a quick and easy read which I could do in small bites, which is all that my schedule allows for these days.In many cases, I felt like the authors were speaking directly to me or about me.I really enjoyed the stories about the ground breaking women of the previous generation...I wish there were more!"
1,Save it for Glamour Magazine,"The authors bring up some interesting issues that are certainly worth discussing, but there is a complete lack of sociological analysis. I was not impressed.This book is full of irritating stylistic conventions and proofreading errors, starting from the first page."
1,Midlife crisis is a misnomer,"I haven't read the book, but I saw the authors discussing it on CNN. I'm sorry, but these women have no clue what a real midlife crisis is. Yes, they have problems juggling a career and family and deciding how to prioritize. This, however, does not constitute a midlife crisis. When people approach 50, they realize that the choices they make (or don't make) will define them for the rest of their lives. This knowledge can create a huge identity crisis that goes way beyond ""prioritizing."" At the same time, hormones are in flux and the entire constitution of a person is changing. A true midlife crisis encompasses attitudinal and physical changes that can only come about at a certain age. No matter how stressful your life is at 30, it ain't no midlife crisis."
3,"A fun, early Burgess novel, not ambitious particularly",as compared to the whole new language invented for Clockwork Orange but a decent effort that English readers would indentify with more than Americans and what was the horse racing system?
1,What has Burgess Done?,"This book is written from the perspective of the stupidestwoman in the world. She doesn't know anything and all that she caresabout is black-heads. I would not recomend anyone waste their time on this book. The beginning is interesting, but as for the rest...it just s**ks. The plot is horrible. I will stop there because I like to keep things short."
2,Not indeph factual presentation,"This video can be purchased for less if bought through BC Video. They offer the same two plus Jurassic Art, that's three videos for $42.00.I have viewed all three, some facts may be true others may be complete fabrications. Bottom line is that the videos do not prove anything. They only open your mind to see more clearly the deceptions made by the establishment. This was a low budget production.What we really need is a mega budget production, with good graphic presentations and the money required to pay top professionals for their honest opinions and conclusions irrelevant to what the academic establishments wants us to beleive as the truth. These lies are the sole fault of the religions, manely the motherfucking catholics. Bottom line two, the bible, koran and other fictions are lies. There is no god. The religious are all evil fools."
3,B Movie good for laughs,"Wow, if you want to have a little laugh with your friends than watch this movie. The story line was good, but I don't know, there is a reason why this isn't on DVD. I guess it was the singers voice. If you watch it then you will know what I mean. It sounded great, but you wouldn't think the actress could be able to sing that way."
4,"Fine follow-up to ""Truth""","Though not as great as ""Truth,"" this album offers some additional evidence for the Jeff Beck case. ""Plynth"" is a fantastic song which is also the only one to make it onto the ""Best of Beck"" compilation. Following on the blues format with a bit more experimentation this time, Beck provided the world with his last blues based effort before embarking on his myriad musical explorations. Keeping the same lineup as ""Truth,"" this album shows Rod Stewart gaining in confidence. ""Beck-Ola"" and it's predecesor both have very Beck-like liner notes, and this one's is unapologetic. The emphasis is on heavy music and creative covers and this album excels at both. If you can find this coupled with ""Truth"" you would be wise to snatch it up and add it to your collection."
3,O.K. book,"Not the best but not the worse book I've ever read. The ""Scenes"" are active cases being investigated by several members of the police department which all get solved in the end. An O. K. read."
5,still going . . . . .,"I started collecting this series about 2 years ago, and surprisingly (for me at least), i'm still going. Inu Yasha is great. Plain and simple. It literally has everything to keep you interested; action/adventure, comedy, romance, and one heckuva plot! Almost every volume has some litle twist that makes you think, ""Uh-oh, now what?"" It's the best! The only problem is that it's gonna be a loooong time until this story's finished, and I'm very impatient!"
2,NOT original versions.,"This CD consists of re-recorded versions of her songs. Not bad re-recordings, but not the same arrangements as the originals. Crystal is in fine voice, by the way."
1,Not what I expected,"My order arrived from the seller, Cascio or whatever their name is. No instructions, no parts list. Nothing. I have tried to take the mounting bolt out and it wont come out. I'm wondering if this is a legit seller. Also, stand assembly is going to require you carry around a wrench with you. I want one that has a wing nit for loosening or a quick release like on a bike. This would be a pain to reassemble every time. I'm sending mine back asap!"
1,jwin atomic clock,"I am in massachusetts, but for some reason this clock keeps switching to central time zone. I put it back, but it likes being an hour off. Dont trust it to wake you up!!"
1,Be Careful! Not everything listed here is real HP toner.,"The Databazaar toner is NOT real HP toner but is remanufactured, be careful because there is no deal to be had buying from them. It should be removed from this page to avoid confusion."
1,This printer model does not like non-OEM toner,"We have tried numerous variations of the non-OEM toner for this particular printer model from a number of different vendors and everyone has failed miserably. As one of the other reviewers noted, printing is very light and every cartridge has had a problem with leakage of toner into the machines. For other printer models we have been very successful and pleased with the less-expensive off-brands, but for this particular printer, stick with the OEM toner."
1,"seller - gofastparts, 3rd party cartridge but HP retail price","I am not trying to save money by getting cheap 3rd part cartridges, I paid in full HP retail price(same as newegg), and I have refunded it, glad that it is fullfilled by Amazon, so the return was simple."
1,Awful Quality,"These toners were a complete waste. Could barely read anything on the prints because it was just smeared with toner. Both of the toners were bad, and I was able to get a refund for 1 of them at least. The genuine HP cartridge works fine in the machine so I know it's the cartridge causing the issues, plus I tried them in 2 separate HP printers. I have never had problems with generic toner before but I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY these ones."
1,Compatibles not genuine HP products,"From WholeSale 321, I ordered the high capacity genuine HP toner Q5942X, which has always worked best in my HP printer. What's advertised is labeled as being ""by HP"" which gives the appearance of being genuine and has the correct product number, Q5942X. I received what appears to be either a fake HP product or a capabitible, Q5942XC, which prices at $88 less through other vendors. Not happy. Amazon is allowing me to return the toner, but they are very unhelpful in identifying which other vendors sell genuine cartridges!! I'll turn to reliable vendors like Staples or J&R. Sorry Wholesale 321, your high rating is not deserved. Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourselves for allowing this chicanery to persist. Very discouraging for a Prime customer."
1,HDC 18 Volt Cordless Drill/Driver Kit with Battery,"My shipment of this item left me in doubt of the positive feedback someone wrote for this drill. Not only did this drill look a bit previously used but my 9.6 volt has more power then this HDC 18 Volt. I can hold the end of the HDC 18 volt drill and keep it from spinning even with a fully charged battery. If all these drills are like this, my advise is ...don't do it. I contacted the seller he said he would (in my case) send a return postage paid label and full refund. To date I have not received it. The old standard seems to be true in this case, if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't what you want."
1,Less power!!,The battery died after 2 monhts. This item is just sitting in Garage!! waste of money!!
2,ya get what ya pay for....,"This isn't B&D;, Skil, Craftsman, Ryobi, etc. quality. If you're expecting that, you'll be disappointed. If I knew what I know after buying this, I'd spend the extra $10-$15 and buy one of those. ;-))I bought one and it works for what I want it to; occasional hole making.I wish it was variable speed and was expecting it to be as 'everything' is nowadays. Nope. Two speeds; on and off. ;-)"
2,Definitely obsolete,The book is great... if you purchased it ten years ago. The vast majority of the text is already obsolete but it still have some good points (the looking is amazing). Not recommended for anyone but newcomer programmers who are willing to learn some old fashioned java.
2,Black Art of Java Game Programming,"I thought this would be great book according to all those reviews. I had this book for just some days and I really think it is out of date actually. The code examples are really not structured and there are methods written that do not even exist. Package imports and access modifiers do not seem to be of the authors knowledge. I know this book should learn people to think object oriented and so on; but to extend the Object class in every example is just confusing for new programmers. There are more things to complain about, but I leave it. However, the book is good concerning the examples and illustrations and sometimes interesting on those pages without mistakes or confusions."
5,Horror movies made into music that sounds and looks awesome!!!,"If you like listen to Nightwish, Kiss and GWAR you are going to love this group. I have not been entertained this much in a long time. the enhanced cd gives you 3 music videos in a zero region DVD side of Lordi's best songs, (Hard Rock Hallalujah, The Devil is a Loser and Blood Red Sandman) The cd side has 2 versions of the first song as well as a bonus track of ""Mr. Killjoy"". that sounds awesome. this group is making headlines overseas and will soon be doing the same over here."
1,Oh My this stinks,"A bunch of tired old goth jokes and cliches thrown together with some average looking artwork. In other words, this (is bad)!"
5,Happy with this product,"Got this for my son's 4th birthday - he's a Cars fanatic like so many boys these days. We got it for the sleepovers inside the house, so it's more to play and not for camping. The backpack straps don't stay on well, but that's not really the point of having it. Would buy as a gift for other boys we know."
4,Need to know history,"Steamboat, Legendary Bucking Horse, is an amazing story that all who love the wild west and live there should know. Many people use Steamboat for a symbol, even the state of Wyoming, and few know anything about this legend. It is truly a story that should be well known to all those who know the name Steamboat."
3,Cute but painful,"These shoes happened to rub my toe the wrong way, despite it being my size. Also, do NOT wear these shoes on slippery floors. I originally purchased them to wear to work and we have linoleum flooring. It was a complete disaster. I nearly did the splits twice, and even when applying the anti slip grip on the bottom I still had trouble with them. I only wear them on occasion now."
5,How to find and keep your life partner,"Every marriage in the 90's should be based on equal partnership, right? But in actuality, most couples haven't a clue as to how to accomplish it. This book tells how. Becoming aware of gender differences in communication, learning to make decisions together in a way that brings unity, learning to create a loving atmosphere through ordinary conversation are just a few topics out of a wealth of good advice found in this book. Keeping the passion and happiness alive throughout a lifelong marriage is not only possible but likely, when couples take to heart what this book offers. I recommend it highly"
1,Forget this one,"The title of this review says it all.The write up for this three story disk was better than all three stories put together.The BUU-RAY rendition was no better. I put this one in a dark place, no no I mean in a drawer."
5,"Please, Please, Please, Release this on DVD!!!!!!",I love the Wonder Years. I am so sad that it is no longer shown on TV as a rerun. Please release it on dvd. I know the expense for the music rights is high but I am sure the demand will prove worthy. Please release it. It is a wholesome show that I would love to watch with my kids!
2,"Beware : there is NO OFFICIAL RELEASE of the series, ANYWHERE !","For those who might find the complete series of The Wonder Years on any website, better stay away from 'em - you're dealing with (apparently very low quality) bootlegs. Google the name of the website, or go straight to the complaintsboard site, you will be amazed by the number of rip-off complaints you will find.As for the chance of seeing this released officially in any near future, I'm afraid there's none, due to the cost of the music copyright. The only alternative I can see, would be going the ""Happy Days way"" - replacing the songs originally used by cheapos, or cutting some sequences. Rather not!!"
5,Brilliant TV Series,"Quite frequently I come here to see whether this has been released on DVD, undoubtedly this is the best TV series I ever watched.It's so true to the childhood of all of us that it would be a loss if this would not be released on DVD.It would have the same value to me as a family picture album.So whoever has the rights on this series, do it's huge fanbase a favor and release it please!"
2,Not The Original Versions,"Bastardized version of the original. Tried one, but it was hard to take if you are a viewer of the originals. If you've never seen it, then you'll be ok. Lacks the original music of the period which is a BIG part of the emotional experience."
4,The Hold Up,"The hold up is simple, folks. Copyright laws are different in the era of DVD and as a result each and every song used in the series (and there were, of course, A LOT of them, the music was a key part of the show) must be individually licensed. If an agreement can't be reached for a particular song it must be changed and studios have learned that doing this too often earns the wrath of devoted fans who do not want songs changed or altered -- just check the outrage over some changes that were made on ""Northern Exposure"" DVD sets, or do a web search with the terms ""WKRP"" and ""Nick at Nite"" if you need confirmation of this.Because of this it is within the realm of possibility that ""The Wonder Years"" may never get a full series on DVD released and that if it does some of the songs will be changed. Sadly, that is just the reality of copyright law today."
4,Not how I remembered it,"I still like it, but why did they have to make changes to it? It was great as it was. Why is it that business always have to change things. It's not necessary. I watch Scooby Doo with my daughters and it's nothing like it was when I was a kid. Leave the originals alone!"
5,please hurry WITH THE WONDER YEARS DVD,i have been waiting for along time....an would love to see the wonder years come out on dvd...ive been checking off an on since 2007...come on we are all waiting....WONDER YEARS DVD.....YEA...V.W
5,What is the holdup?,"What could possibly be holding up the release of The Wonder Years? There aren't that many songs to get the license for and one would hope that the demand is there.With the non-release of anything past year 1 of St. Elsewhere and Larry Sanders, the non-release of the Wonder Years remains a sin in my book.Bookend The Wonder Years with The Waltons and you will have the best of television about families.C'mon, let's get off our butts and get this out!!"
5,One of the best TV shows in the past 25 years,"My sons ask me repeatedly if ""The Wonder Years"" is ever going to be on DVD in complete sets. I loved watching this show with my sons; the music, the news, the clothes and the uncertainty. These were my ""wonder years,"" and I loved sharing those times with my sons. It is one for the ages, truly a TV classic."
5,What would you do if I released a DVD to you Would you buy it from me?,"Where is this DVD? I've been waiting a long time and I don't mind waiting longer, as long as when it's released the musical scores are the originals. Its worth writing agian: ""ABC"" please keep the original songs that were in all the episodes! The only reason I say this is because my other favoite show ""Quantum Leap"" was released on DVD without the orginal music. Did I buy ""Quantum Leap""? NO. Period pieces like ""Quantum Leap"" and ""The Wonder Years"" are worthless without the original music in it. ABC Please do not compromise the musical aspect of this great show!"
5,Bring The Wonder Years out on DVD! (All Regions!),"I can't believe the studio has yet to bring out THE WONDER YEARS on DVD, who doesn't love it??!! There are plenty of copies available on the internet and EBay but I don't want a copy, I want the original, official collection, all six seasons!!! Please, please, please, back me up and demand the release of this classic, for all regions!! (I'm from England and need it to be available on Region 2 DVD's).Thank you"
5,Watch it on Netflix,As of October 2011 the whole series can be streamed on Netflix. While I have been angry with Netflix about their pricing baloney as of late this is a big score for them. I say watch it there and save the money you would spend on this.
5,PLEASE MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE,"I have grew up with ""The Wonder Years"" and it brings me back loads of cool and sad memories. I would like to experience these memories in the best possible way. That is on DVD. I'm not only speaking about my self, I'm also speaking on behalf of all Wonder Years fans out there. Please make it happen. Thanks"
5,All Those Magical Moments...,"Kevin and Winnie's first kiss in Harper's Woods, Chuck Coleman's freakish squnting, Davis Schwimmer Desperado rainstorm, Wayne's hamster vacuuming, Paul's fun-ruining, Kevin's punching of Eric the goober lifeguard, Alice's voice, Wayne's taking the fall for Kevin's beer bash, Becky Slater's right hook to the jaw, Kevin's summer lake girl, Ricky's nose girl, and, Kevin and Winnie's magical last, greatest moment in a rainy barn...when they realized that growing up cannot be stopped. The time has come to work out the music rights, work out the kinks, the barriers, the delays, the egos and rise above it all. It's important that this generation and the next and the next have an opportunity to experience these extraordinary television moments. Figure it out. The world has so much misery...we all need a little more wonder."
5,PLEASE RELEASE IT,"Hey you people working over at the studio who created this show, if your reading this, RELEASE THE DVD. dont you see how many people are waiting for this. i agree that out of all the shows, this one deserves to be on DVD. HURRY UP!your killing all of us."
3,Remade music and new narrator are a disappointment,"I was a big fan of The Wonder Years and was thrilled to see it available for streaming. I was shocked to find, however, that throughout this series, some of the music (including the opening credits!!) has been replaced with cover versions. In addition, the voice of the narrator has been completely redone with a new actor. To someone who's never seen this show before, I think they'll still enjoy it. However, for those like me who grew up watching this, it's very disappointing. I might as well just start recording it from TV if I want the actual series."
2,Where is it??,"This is a one-of-a-kind, groundbreaking television show that deserves to be out on DVD as a whole set by now. This is ludicrous!! Think of what other mediocre shows are already out there on DVD literally months after they've been cancelled or gone off the air. I'm not sure I want to spend my money on an abbreviated version of a Wonder Years collection... I think it's almost better to try and record it when I see it on TV.If anyone is reading this who is affiliated with the decision to release Wonder Years on DVD, I can safely say that at least 10 people I know would be interested in purchasing the set if it came out. Please release it, this is completely ridiculous!!!!! YOU WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE A PROFIT!!!"
3,"Hey folks, it's out there, just not HERE!!!! Google it","Hey guys, before writing these stupid reviews why don't you search for it and find it on other sites...it's out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The Wonder Years not worth the wait,"Our kids had asked for this once for their birthday then for Christmas and it appears the producers or someone in the field does not want it released. Now our kids waited so long and it never came out on dvd, they don't even care about it anymore. These actors are doing very little now and they are no longer popular so we decided not to buy it even if it does come out. Enough waiting for an old series. Not worth it......Life goes on!"
5,PLEASE GIVE ME THE WONDER YEARS,I was discussing with my boyfriend that i would be absolutly exstatic if the wonder years came out with a DVD bow set. I would buy it in a second if it came out. I love that show and it would be a smart move to release a box set. Please give the world the wonder years!!!!!
1,NOT GOOD,BORING BORING BORING! Unless you are an 'over the hill codger' or an overweight simpering virgin with no life...this CD equates to nails on a chalk board! Perhaps put to better use in sleep clinics for insomniacs!! A subpar voice that has little range and even less personality. The selection of songs is absurd at best! Little thought and intellect seems to have gone into the song selection. Perhaps next time:select songs that are just a little more mainstream.
4,What a discovery! Trones is terrific,"The album is dated 1999 on the back, but I just found this album, and what a delight it is. John Trones has a beautiful voice, and he does a marvelous mix of standards and contemporary pop. My favorites were ''One Fine Day,'' ''My Romance'' and ''Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful'' (from Rodgers & Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''). Plus, John glows with Jim Brickman's ''Love of My Life.'' This is such a romantic album and it really reminds me of Tom Andersen's work. For instance, Tom's first CD, ''Far Away Places,'' also features a dreamy ballad from ''Cinderella,'' ''Ten Minutes Ago.'' They both know how to set a sexy mood that mesmerizes you with their music. The only misstep: Recording something as overdone as ''It Had to Be You'' (Harry Connick). Otherwise, I can't wait until I hear John's next CD!"
5,Smooth and Mellow,"Simply one of my favorite CD's. A well produced, consistent album that you can listen to over-and-over again. Too many favorites to list. John is a well known talent in Minnesota, looking forward to his next release."
1,"save your money, look elsewhere for labor history & analysis","I noticed that this book - an extremely lame, repititive, crushingly boring collection of speeches by a guy named Jack Barnes, the ringleader of a tiny 'socialist' party that, once upon a time, had some relevance in the U.S. - has been praised by several 'reviewers' on Amazon. Each of these reviewers, though, are apparently members of Barnes' silly little outfit, because each of them have praised other books published by Pathfinder, the publisher for the Socialist Workers Party. So for anyone looking for insightful commentary and analysis on labor history and issues, please look elsewhere (labor notes, labourstart, David Bacon, Kim Moody, etc.)."
3,Not quite,This book was not what I wanted to teach children about saving money. This book would be better used for an activity on rhyming words.
2,NOT about judicious money management!,"Although this book is very cute, it does not teach money management In a way that my children (ages 2-5) can grasp. On the first page or two, Honey Bunny receives money from a few sources, then proceeds to spend and spend and spend and spend until the very last page, in which she magically still has money left to save. So although the book does -mention- the word savings, it presents it in a context of ""spend as much as you want, and there will be plenty left over later."""
2,just ok,Bought book b/c reviews looked like it would be a nice story to teach value of money. Story is about a bunny that spends all her money on a treat for her then her family and friends. Did not really give the point I had noped. Cute rhymes that the kids like but I had different expectations. Oh well.
1,Total Bunk,"After reading several books on occultism and the esoteric orders, I think it is mostly bunk. It seems that a desire to severe from the status quo, an overactive imagination, and an egotistical drive to be involved in magic pretty much sums up occultism. They seem to tenuously link together such things as the Egyptian mysteries, Hermeticism, alchemy, Greek mystery/philosophy schools, and various interpretations about the 17th Century Rosicrucian letters to get occultism and modern mystery schools. And to think it all started with the ancient, highly advanced culture of Atlantis, the lost continent, that was an allegory written of by Plato.Now, all of that said, if you are into esoteric orders and occultism, Dion Fortune was apparently one of the leading ladies of the occult in her time, and her work is still revered by those in such circles. Maybe then this book is for you."
5,90 Minutes in Heaven,"My husband and I had the opportunity to hear Don Piper speak, the co-author of ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" this past summer. Don was involved in a ""fatal"" accident to which he died and went immediately to heaven. His book, ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" tells about his accident, his experience at the ""gates of Heaven"" and what he went through after his return to earth. Don Piper did not have a ""near death experience"". When Don came back to life here on earth, he was in the hospital for 13 months and under went 34 surgeries. He was in tremendous pain and asked God, ""Why did you allow me to come back to this?"" Don knows ""why"" now! This book is inspiring, encouraging and thought provoking.....a must read! His second book, ""Heaven is Real"", I liked even more."
1,rip off??,"What I received was not the paperback full version of 90 Minutes in Heaven but a ""hardback"" with a few selections in large type!"
5,Completely Satisfied,We received our 5 copies of the book and gave one to each of our 5 children who enjoyed reading the book.
3,"90 Minutes in Heaven, a True Story of Life & Death","This book was OK. I was expecting more about his heavenly experience than his healing process. I understand the man had a journey in life to take, but trip of heaven, was only one part of one chapter, the rest of the book is about his misery. Not what I was expecting - or hoping to read about."
4,90 Minutes in Heaven,Good story about a near death experience and the way it changed the author's life.
5,Fireproof,"It's the story of a husband and wife who are on the edge of getting a divorce but is applicable to any relationship.1. View the relationship thrugh the eyes of the other party and a totally differen picture emerges.2. Analyze what you think you've given to the relationship, maybe your halo isn't quit as shiny as you thought.3. Give because you care about the other person not for the points you think you should get.4. Bring God into the equation and your giving becomes a joy not a burdon.I seldom watch a movie more than once but I did this one a learned more each time."
2,A Reverend Who Got a Ticket for No Seat Belts?,"Okay, I only read the freebie glimpse Amazon offers, but he confesses up front that he doesn't usually wear seatbelts and only buckled up this time because he'd gotten a traffic ticket a few days earlier? And his 'death' was pronounced by someone simply taking his pulse at the accident scene?Not the brightest candle at the altar.This is more about selling books and getting the believers to chime in than it is anything valid. Did he give any details about heaven that prove he was there?"
5,A Must Read,Everyone should read this book. Read the whole thing from cover to cover in a matter of hours...I just couldn't put it down. What a marvelously written account of real life events.
4,Food for thought...,"I enjoyed this book so much that I sent copies to all my friends.It is not complicated and is easy to read...and re-read.The author is in a horrific car accident and is pronouned dead 3 times. Ninety minutes later he awakens here on earth and not only has miraculously survived, but during those 90 minutes he tells us of his 90 minute visit in heaven.He tries to explain what he heard and saw but that is impossible. From his narrative though we see and hear heaven through his eyes and ears.A wonderful thought-provoking book that deeply touches the soul. Easy to read and wonderful in the remembering."
1,90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN,Book purported to reveal the author's near death experience. One brief chapter did this. But 90% of the book seemed only to be about the difficulties of his medical recovery and an emphasis on the power of prayer.
1,Don't waste your money or time,"This book was horrible. I quit reading it after about page 70. I was hoping it would get better the longer I read but it only got worse. The entire book I felt was about Don Piper feeling sorry for himself that he survived a traumatic experience. People overcome life changing events daily but don't publish a book and collect a nice penny off of it. It wasn't at all what I expected and focused entirely of him and his life. Please don't waste your money, time reading it, or the time of the delivery staff to have to ship it to you. You will be disappointed."
3,"Trip to Heaven, followed by long ordeal on earth","The ""good"" part of this book is only a few pages (maybe 10 pages, if I remember right). Here, I'm talking about Don Piper's experience in Heaven. The bulk of the book depicts Don's horrible recovery process after a very bad car accident in which he was thought to be hopelessly dead. Toward the end, Don helps others going through similar recoveries. It is rather educational and kind of inspirational."
4,90 Minutes in Heaven,I really enjoyed this book. It helped to comfort me regarding the death of my father. It also really makes you count your blessings and testifies to the glory and wonders of the Almightly. I suggest that all who believe read this book and for those who don't believe read 23 Minutes in Hell.
5,Excellent Book - A Must Read,"After hearing about Don Piper's story from several members of my Church family, I had to buy this book. I am not much of a reader. As a matter of fact, I would almost say that I do not like to read. Once I started reading Don Piper's story I couldn't put it down. His testimony is a real blessing. I have read this book over and over again. I would highly recommend that everyone read this book."
2,false advertising,"This book was a great disappointment and I felt the name was very misleading...probably to grab the readers interest and snag a buy. If it had been published under a different title I might not have had such a negative view of the book. The title leads you to believe that the book is about this person's experience in Heaven but very little of the book is actually about that experience. Even when he touches on that aspect the descriptions are very vague. The story is more about his accident and recovery, not his actual time spent in Heaven. Felt ripped off after reading this book and also felt that the title was intended to mislead readers so they would buy the book."
3,Not enough of heaven,This book started out very well and I could not wait to turn the pages. Then after 5 pages of heaven it was all about Mr. Pipers issues with his health. Heaven was a mere memory not the real meaning of the book. I never felt connected to the character or his family. I give anyone who can write a book 3 stars so that is the reason for the star rating.
2,"Misleading title: should read 2 chapters in heaven, 15 chapters in recovery",The two chapters about heavan are worth the read! I would not pass this book along.
3,I was bored and had to push myself to finish this book!,"First of all I want to preface that I am a born again christian. I love these kind of books that talk about accounts of heaven or miracles, since we live in a fallen world and any kind of ""positive, uplifting"", reading is nice. I hate to say it, but I was pretty much bored by this book. Being a Charismatic, Pentecostal, Christian, and having seen many miracles at Church. This book seemed very Baptist to me in feeling. Don Piper is Baptist. No insults implied. For example: Don Piper even commented that Heaven was really REAL, as if he was not really sure. This book for me was way too ""baby Christian"" for me. That is what I am trying to convey. This book was lacking ""the power of the Holy Spirit"" to change me the reader. Not much mention of Jesus, really no mention of the Holy Spirit, more was said about Pipers recovery from a terrible accident. Try Burpo's sons account of Heaven!"
3,Interesting,"The first part of this book was fairly well written. The description of Heaven was beautiful. Then the book became harder to read, so much so that I almost quit reading it. First, Rev. Piper should have consulted somebody in the medical field for better descriptions of what took place. Some of his medical explanations don't make sense. Secondly, this section of the book is disjointed. He repeats himself frequently. I was not disappointed with the stories of his recovery, however, though it does make the title misleading. I think he is very honest about his depression and anger, which cannot be easy for a minister to admit. I just wish the book were better edited. It is a great testimony of faith."
1,Not Much Description,This book contained only eleven pages of description about heaven. The remainder was about the long physical recovery of Don Piper from his accident.
3,90 Minutes in Heaven,The book was not quite what was expected but was an interesting read. It turns out the 90 minutes in heaven was only a small portion of the book content. Worth reading
3,It's about faith.,"I've read much on the subject, and I've experienced much as well. And I truly intended to pan this story as I just don't buy into it 'cause it's just a little too slick for my liking. However, if you've faith, and you believe Mr. Piper's accounting, and what he believes it all means, then who am I to go around bursting ""bubbles"". Have a go at it, and if you're moved by it then I suppose that's really all that matters."
2,A Biography about a Pastors life and death,"Don, was a pastor at the First Baptist church. He gets in a serious car accident with a semi-truck. For 90 minutes, Don lay lifeless with his left hand hanging on only by the skin, and both his legs smashed to pieces. Basically, the whole book was about Don's recovery from the accident.The thing that I liked about this book was that it gave you a glimpse of what it would be like to be in heaven. One thing you might like is the constant descriptive details about his experience. It also tells about his life after the accident and all the things he had to do in his recovery.I did not like that the two chapters the author had on heaven had the least amount of details. Also, the book was very boring at times. The organization of what time in his life he was talking about was very difficult to follow.My overall opinion was that was not a book for my age group. It could have been better organized. This is a book that you could read on a long car trip."
5,Don Piper's Rebirth,"Except in the physical sense, this experience has made Dom an overall beter person. It opened his eyes to the needs of others; offering reassurance where doubt was. He can honestly say ""I've been there and done that""! If you are wavering in your faith, I recommend you read this book."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,The disappointing thing about this book was that only one chapter actually dealt with the author's 90 minutes in Heaven. The rest was mostly the story of his recovery from the horrific accident he was in.
2,"Expected uplifting, got depressing","The book went in a cycle of ""I'm in pain. I'm depressed. Life sucks. Oh, but heaven was beautiful. But that doesn't matter because I'm in pain. I'm depressed. Life sucks. I wish I'd never come back. Oh yea, I have a wife and a few kids that I barely mention. Heaven was beautiful. Life sucks. I'm in pain. I'm depressed. Oh yea, but heaven was great."" Very narcissistic point of view, very depressing and more about his accident, pain and injuries than about heaven. It's like his experience in heaven was used to sell a book that's mostly about his misery in recovery."
1,"No, no, no, no....","Just a bunch of silly religious crap (can I say crap?). Are we really suppose to believe that heaven conveniently fits all of the Christian expectations and that only good ""Christians"" get in??? The part that I thought was amusing was when he described heaven's ""gates."" Heaven's gates are as far as he could see in both directions and as high as he could see up. I thought, as I read, that his face was plastered against the dash and he could not move his head....so....he was most likely looking at the crushed dashboard....just a thought....Save your money or buy ""Conversations with god"" if you want some sort of minor religious experience..."
3,"Love the Chapters on Heaven, the rest is very hard","I loved the 2 chapters on what heaven was like. How beautiful and comforting. I was affected by the authors suffering and anger, which is normal in his situation, but which was very hard to read. If you are a sensitive soul, you might want to skip it.The messages of love and hope are wonderful, though.."
2,Disappointed.,"I've had this book on my list for quite awhile. I was disappointed that so much of it was about his recovery and his miserable state after the accident, and so little about his actual experience in heaven. The title is sort of deceiving, as there are only a few pages about his experience in heaven. I finish all the books I start, but really struggled at the end of this one, as I couldn't wait to get on to something else. He was rather repetitive in his writing. Maybe my expectations were too high ... when something is on my list for awhile, I have very high expectations!"
3,90 Minutes in Heaven,90 Minutes in Heaven is the story of one who died and saw heaven. Lots of good stuff in it. A good read and an encouraging and uplifting book.
4,90 minutes in heaven,"I enjoyed the book. It does repeat itself alot but it was inspirational. I always wondered about heaven and his description of heaven sounds beautiful, I can understand why he wanted to stay but it wasn't his time. He needed to come back and help others."
4,Just enough to make it real,"As I glanced through other reviews of this book, I noticed many of the negative reviews voiced the same issue -- ""there wasn't enough about his experience in Heaven"". But that's what confirmed its authenticity to me along with his self-admitted inability to describe it. I'm confident Reverand Piper conveyed exactly what he experienced and that it wasn't embellished or enhanced merely to satisfy our earthly desires for more information. A lesser author would have done so to sell more books! His experience in Heaven was the most intriguing part of the book, but of greater value was what he did with that experience as well as the mental and physical challenges following his accident. In summary, it's a confirmation of God's promises to us regarding Heaven, a reminder that we all serve a purpose for Him while on earth, and a prompting regarding our responsibility to ensure others are saved."
1,"Should be called ""3 years in Recovery"" not ""90 min in Heaven""","I gotta tell you, I dont read books very much..I'm not a big reader but the title of this book caught me. I wanted to read about heaven...I am a Christian and this book really caught my eye.The book is about 100+ pages long and his discussion about heaven is only the first 15 pages. The rest of the story is about his recovery and the trials he went through thereafter...its not a book which discusses throughout his ""90 minutes in heaven."" I think this book would be inspirational to individuals who have gone through similar circumstances but to those of us who wanted to see a ""glimpse of heaven"", there wasnt much meat there.."
2,bummed out!,"The beginning was very good, and then it just got plain old depressing and he repeats himself over, and over, and over! I couldn't stand it anymore, had to quit reading it."
3,One Minute in Heaven,"I didn't finish this book. I was more interested in what he saw in heaven ,but that was only a small part of the book. The rest was his recovery and his experiences of sharing with others what he saw. It was more like one minute in heaven.I know there is a heaven and all of us that do are interested in someone that had a glimpse. I also know that kind of injury to your brain can dream what you may have already been thinking it might be like. Non the less we don't know everything,we just think we do."
4,Good,I enjoyed this book. I'm a believer so it was great to read of this mans experience. I wish the book had more of the heaven experience and less of the crash.
3,"after 90 minutes, it was over","After reading the 90 minutes in heaven part, the book was over. I would have hoped the author could have found others with the same experience. It would have made it more interesting. The rest was very repetitive.Sally Danforth"
2,long drawn out story,The story was drawn out. It could have gotten same message across with less chapters.
3,"Good, but....","not exactly what I expected, I mean only a few pages are dedicated to his NDE. Much of the discussion lies in his recovery. I admit, the book did move me in self reflection. I recommend ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" for a similar but direct message. Not satisfied in terms of looking for more info on NDE's or powerful reflections. I'd pass."
5,Strengthened my faith,"I absolutely loved the book. There is a little repetition, but the faith, joy and love of what we have to look forward to gave me chills at times. If you or someone you know is looking for encouragement and their purpose in life, I highly recommend this book."
5,truly inspiring,"This book is an awesome story of a true life after death story.It is not only about the author's trip to heaven, but also with his struggles upon being brought back to life on Earth. An unbelievably emotional struggle by a minister that made it to heaven, and God sent him back. A must read for anyone struggling with many of life's great difficulties."
3,90,Insightful experience. I just wish the book would have been rewritten several times by a ghost writer to expand the story.
4,Fragile and Moving.....,"One of the most poignant themes of the book is that life can change in a blink of an eye. Hypothetically, I think a lot of people would agree with that, but the book looks at a real life situation in which a man's life was change irrevocably from a brush with death.I walked away thinking more about death, and what it means in this life. I felt overwhelmed by the fragility of life and the pleasure we so earnestly seek in this life. All of it, compared to death, is, like Solomon said, ""A chasing of the wind."" This is not our home, and that thought is joyful and also painful: joyful because this world is full of depravity and sadness, and heaven seems so sweet in the middle of all this pain; but the thought of heaven is painful because there is so much pleasure and joy in this life that we will have to leave. Just some of my thoughts."
1,Unbelievable,"I wanted to give this book a real chance to speak it's message to me, but I just couldn't get past the fact that the author claims to have been dead, not to have had a near-death experience, but to have actually be dead, deceased, past away. Scriptually, there are only 2 people who have come back to life from the dead: Lazarus and Christ. Is the author claiming to be the third? His description of Heaven is so ridiculous and shallow that it can only speak to the fact that he was in a deep unconscious state and in that state saw what he had been taught as a child (as we all are) that Heaven has pearly gates, etc. I was actually embarrassed to be reading about all his dead acquaintances running to see him at the pearly gates. I'm just glad that I didn't actually pay to read this - I downloaded it for free on my Kindle. I couldn't even finish it although I tried really hard, I really did."
1,"Utterly, utterly depressing!","I am just glad that this was a free book via the Kindle version!I wish I'd NEVER started it. I doubt I'll be able to finish it, and I'm more than halfway through.The descriptions are vivid, and very, very, very depressing.I really don't believe that the author actually entered heaven; if he did, being sent back to earth to endure a horrific, painful recovery just seems incredibly cruel and pointless."
1,Save your money,"I read this book straight through. Not because it was a gripping book or held my interest; it was more like get to the point already.A lot of verbage about nothing, I forget how many pages were used to discribe the road. This easily could have been a one chapter. Save your money, please!"
2,Preachy,"This book could have been better if the author explored other explanations for his experience. Instead, he uses the book to preach to others about his views of Christianity. The narrative jumps around too much as well. I am only halfway through and cannot get myself to finish the book.For a less ""mainstream Christianity"" view of the afterlife, try ""Journey of Souls: Case Studies of life between Lives"" by Michael Newton."
2,Disappointing little book,Disappointing is the word that mostly comes to mind. I bought this to hear about the 90 minutes in heaven not about the difficult recovery and especially about Baptist doctrine. It was almost a perfect waste of time.
4,Painfull Hapiness,"This book gives you the outline of what it's like when you first get to heaven. It's a true story about a preacher who went to a meeting for his faith. It was dark and rainy on his way home and when he got to a bridge he wrecked. He was announced dead as soon as the EMTs arrived, and at that moment, he was dead. But thanks to God and the miracles he does, the preacher would come back to life but for a price, and it was all of the pain that he had to go through with a crushed leg and a glass infested face. The book lets the preacher teach what he learned, appreciate God and understand why you go through the things you do.I like the purpose of the story and the comfort it gave off. I didn't like how a lot of times the narrator said the description was too great for words so he couldn't describe it, I just hated how many times it was said. I recommend this book to anyone who likes their religion, wants to get closer to God, and just wants a warm feeling book to read."
1,awesome,i really enjoyed this book. i really couldnt put it down. it is one of the most interesting books i have read in awhile. i want to thank rev.piper for sharing his amazing story. god bless you.
1,Be a Berean,"It is said that discerment is greatly lacking in the body of Christ, I beg you to look up Hebrews 9:27 and 2 Corinthians 5:8 then carefully consider if Mr. Piper's experience confirmed these truths."
1,This book turned me to athiesm.,"I found the plot, subject matter, and storyline so outragously farfetched in the book that after reading the story I was forced to question my Christian beliefs. In fact, I credit this book with making me an athiest. The author has done a fine job in that his vivid, flowing descriptions of near death experiences (or NDEs) are quite similar to all other NDE descriptions. The author's pacing, style, and tone are superb. There is nothing wrong aesthetically with this book . . . it's just that it will likely make you see how silly some of your beliefs are after you read it. I would recommend this book without reservation because the world needs more athiests."
5,I Read it in 2 days,"The day I received the book I began reading it and couldn't put it down. Every free moment, I would read it and had to force myself to put it down. It was so great to read about what heaven will be like and being greeted by all the love ones that have passed before us. I cried at the pain and angusish that Don had to endure. The limited pictures were helpful in identifing with his situation. I do wish he would have included a picture of his wonderful wife who went through this journey by his side. Thank you Don for sharing such a personal and difficult experience. Your honesty was humbling."
5,90 Minutes in Heaven,"A fascinating look into Heaven but more importantly, a look into humanity and how one man took tragedy and turned it around to the benefit of his fellow man."
3,90 minutes in heaven book,I bought this book because someone told me it would be good for me to read since I just lost my husband and so far it has been really good and has helped me out some the 90 minutes devotional helped me the most but would recommed this book too
2,90 Minutes of Whining...,"Wow! This book was really not what I expected at all. There was only one small portion of the book that covers his visit to heaven, and the rest of it is spent telling of all his troubles and pain during recovery.Secondly, I was surprised that a Baptist Minister would have such a negative attitude after such an amazing experience, and also that he would keep such a story to himself for so long, then only reveal it when it's validity was challenged.The story could have been really interesting, but there was just something about the tone that really rubbed me the wrong way. I found it to be preachy, and self serving, and not uplifting at all. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Different Book,"This was totall missing several chapters from the orginal 90 minutes in Heaven that I orginally had. All the chapters of him in the hospital and his recovery and being angry with God, etc are missing from this reprinted book. WHY??"
3,More Heaven!,"When the author is struck head-on by the semi and dies, he tells of his experience going to Heaven. We get to learn about who he sees there, what it sounds like and feels like and when he is sent back to his body 90 minutes later, we learn about tragic response of friends and family to the accident. The experience in Heaven comprises about 1 chapter in the book and the rest of the book is about his recovery from the accident, his spiritual growth and trying to accept all that has happened. I was honestly expecting the book to focus more on the experience in Heaven. Certainly not to diminish his accident in any way or recovery but the title was slightly misleading to what was delivered between the pages. I do believe that the author's accident and experience in Heaven is a worth-while read, just believed it to be something else from the title."
2,"High Hopes, Big Disappointment","As many others have noted here, I had high hopes that his book would give more spiritual insight into heaven and faith. However, I was left wanting. The content of the chapters were loosely strung together and the repetition of phrases and lack of cohesion was frustrating. I've yet to finish the final chapters, and I'm not even certain I'll waste my time. The most positive thing I can say about the writing--it had the potential to be a really good book."
4,Did he still have to connect in Atlanta?,"Author Don Piper was horribly injured in a car accident one day in 1989. He died, went to heaven and the miraculously returned to earth to undergo a long and painful course of rehab. It is tempting to catalog ""90 Minutes"" into the genre of near death experiences. This was a real death experience.Whether you believe Piper's account or not may be beside the point. You either take it on faith or you don't. Piper explores his mission on earth as it became unveiled to him following this glimpse of the afterlife. His tale gives hope to those who face suffering in this life and yearn for something better in the afterlife."
5,awesome,This book is wonderful. It simply gives credence to our faith. I've stopped thinking of all the scientific reasons for afterlife stories. Don Piper has truly stepped into heaven.
2,Not so much,"You think you're going to get a BOOK about the afterlife, but no, you get one chapter, and then the rest of the book about his religious beliefs. It was disappointing."
2,Great Story but disappointing to read,"The beginning of the book tells about his experience in heaven - maybe 15 pages. The remaining 90 percent is about his recovery, how nice his friends and family were during his recovery, the hospital staff and so on and so on. I was not particularly inspired, motivated or moved by the way this story is presented. But, I could have been if it were written differently."
4,interesting book,"Not alot of details about heaven, but did cover the struggles the author went throught during his years in recovery and how this accident changed his life."
4,Perfect for anyone,"Enjoyed this book very much, particularly chapter 3 that describes his time in heaven. The latter part of the book where he talks about his healing seems to drag on a bit but it is still an enjoyable read."
2,Not what I expected,Like other readers I thought this was going to be a book about Heaven but it was mainly about his recovery. It is still an interesting book I just don't understand why he didn't speak more about his experience in Heaven or change the title to something that is not as misleading.
3,Thought provoking.,A view of a life changing experience in one man's opportunity to evaluate the past and seek a more meaningful future.
3,90 Minutes in Heaven,"If you are questioning life after death, this book will give hope to your heart. You must ask Jesus into your heart and life. He is the only way."
3,Expected something different,"I also must join the club of reviewers who expected more about Heaven in this book. It was very brief in the beginning, but then turned to Piper's recovery and confusion (depression) about returning to earth to deal with his pain. I admire this man and his family for all he went through and for the hope he gives many people, but I stopped reading about 80 percent of the way through."
4,"Nice, as well as some unusual reading as the name implies","This book was well done, especially the part about his visit to Heaven. I would suggest that there was a little too much time given to his pain and suffering afterwards for me, but each to his own. I thought that would be nice had it been reduced a good bit and I just thought that went on for a little too much in the book, but it's most interesting reading and gives an insight not often found. His work toward helping others in the windup of the book was heart rending also. Good book, enjoyable. I'd recommend it for sure."
3,Not what I expected,"The out of body experience covered about 4 pages and that was it really. The rest of the book just chronicled the trauma and recovery from the terrible injuries from the accident. Although, this was a terrible time for the author, the main thing was supposed to be about the OBE. Well that's why I bought the book. I would have thought 90 minutes in heaven would have given more insights into the next world. I was rather disappointed. I don't want to put down the traumatic experience of the author but the book was about his physical recovery rather than about any insights into what happens when we leave this mortal place."
4,Inspiring,"I started reading this book in the store and I almost felt compelled to buy it. The title is slightly misleading, there's only one chapter about his experience in heaven, however this is a great story about one man's recovery from a serious accident and the injuries caused by it. It's also made me think about what I'm doing with my life and what I can do to improve it, we are only here for a short time after all.I don't think this book will convince anybody to change their minds about God, there's not enough evidence to convince skeptics and Christians will just use it to reaffirm what they already believe, that's not the point of the book though."
3,Great lessons learned and easy to read,"Bought book for my teenager who hates to read, but she loved reading this book. A friend told her about it, so she wanted to read it - at first she was a little disappointed that it didn't answer all of her questions about what Heaven is like, but after reading it, she said she learned alot about how and why to appreciate life a little more. Also, my brother in law read it after loosing his dad and it helped him to overcome a great deal of anxiety. I loved it too! However, I would never buy from this seller again. It took nearly a month to get to me and arrived after Christmas was over...so, it was a late gift."
3,Not Everyone's Thing,"Although I know the author sincerely experienced the events, it is told from a highly religious perspective. Since I believe we see things at death that most closely represent our belief system, this was highly personal and probably is different for everyone."
4,This is an inspiring and touching book,"This book is one of the most interesting I have ever read. Well written, with a story to tell that we all would hope could happen to any of us..An easy to read book that recounts an intense and unique amazing personal spiritual experience. That's a lot of adjectives! I read this because I know people who have had visions of heaven, The LORD, saints passing to glory and a whole range of experiences. I liked this because if anyone looking if you are looking for inspiration...this is it! Don Piper's story is amazing and well written. He shows you what real courage is by having the ability to keep going every day even though he lives in constant pain.This book just makes Heaven all the more real because you're reading about it from someone who's been there."
3,nice book,I read this book and i gave it three stars because it talks more about the accident than the treasured visit to Heaven. I know that the accident had to be wrote about but not so much of it. It's good reading tho.
3,A Mediocre Book about an Extraordinary Experience,"This is a pretty mediocre book about an extraordinary experience of the author Don Piper, who spent 90 minutes in heaven after being certified dead from an automobile accident. But in fact, it's more about his recovery and coming to terms with the limitations of his 'new normal' body after numerous operations. The description about heaven is terse and patchy, offering nothing more than what's described in the Bible. The only chapter that has moved me is `Touching Lives', which is filled with a number of stories about how he has helped other patients undergoing similar treatment. Even then, the descriptions are factual rather than reflective. The account of how he had got into depression and refused help from well-intentioned church members is interesting but repetitive, and the lesson he's learnt seems simplistic. Overall, it's an easy read and should offer some encouragement to those who fear death."
2,Amazing but is this for real?,"This book was recommended to me by a nurse in the oncology department so I anticipated wonderful answers to soothe my fears about my dying husband.Piper's descriptions of heaven are exactly like those we heard when we were children: seeing our loved ones, ""floating"" around, etc.The book read like someone's dream.The writing is poor but there is a lot of substance for someone wondering about Christianity."
5,great book,this is a great book it gave me the answers i have been seaking i reccomend this for anyone that has lost a loved one
2,90 minutes in heaven,"I didn't find enough evidence to convince me of the claims in this book. I especially wanted more information about the medical condition of the man while he was in the car. Devout Christians may not have a problem with it. The man was certainly courageous, tho. I admire him for that."
2,Disappointing but not entirely awful,"Recently losing both of my parents I thought it would be comforting to read this book. However, I was disappointed to find out that the majority of the book (98%) dealt with Don Piper's struggles to recover from a horrific accident and not his brief visit to heaven. Unlike other reviewers though I do not feel the need to condemn him for this, that or the other. I just want people to be aware that the book is more centered around what happens after his time in heaven, not his actual time in heaven. I would suggest getting it from the library if possible."
4,90 Minutes In Heaven,"Excellent story. Quick read and will keep the reader turning the pages. I read this with a book club in Tokyo. The Japanese, non-Christian, readers didn't enjoy the book as much as I did."
4,A Book to Share,"A friend at church loaned me this book. After reading it and finding how touching this story was, I bought two copies. One I gave as a gift to a friend who had mentioned that she wanted to read it again and the other will be shared among friends and members at my church. Perhaps the medical treatments part of the book could have been shortened but the Rev. Piper's story of being brought back to life and the purpose he now feels called to provide are certainly inspirational."
1,Sorry I read it...,"This book isn't about heaven or a near death experience nor is it well written. This book is about religion. The story was scattered, repetitive, hokey and contrived. Don't try to sell me under the guise of a story. Ummm... I don't think I would recommend this tale."
1,Not God's Gift,"I'm sorry, but this book just left me cold. I thinks the author probably believes what he writes is what he saw, yet it seems to me to be a version of what we might want heaven to be, not what it is. Is this a case of a terrible trauma creating memories from wishes? Maybe I'm just a horrible sceptic."
5,90 mins in Heaven,Story was easy to read and was believable. The author(s) used everyday language and provided word pictures that portrayed well the physical and spiritual pain and suffering that accompanied this experience.Don Piper has credibility by waiting so long (15 years) to tell his story and being so reluctant to tell it.I understand why the book has sold over 1 million copies. It is a blessing to all who read it.
1,Wrong title,"After losing a loved one, a friend of mine gave me this book. Because of the title, I expected the larger part part of the book to be about the 90 minutes the author spent in heaven. I was disappointed. Only a few pages are about that and there are no details. For example, we don't know what the author talked about with the family and friends who welcomed him in heaven. Then the rest of the book (the largest part) is about the author's road to recovery. I think the title is deceptive."
2,Amazing story but terribly written,"By the third chapter of the book I was rereading the author blurb at the back, incredulous that Cecil Murphey has apparently written 91 books. This book obviously made the best seller list purely on curiosity and shock-value, not on any literary value. It's an amazing story but the needlessly repetitive style is completely frustrating and structurally incompetent. It honestly amazes me that it got published as is. I couldn't finish it. The disappointingly short chapter on Don's actual experience in heaven proves how misleading the title is too, as other reviewers have mentioned.If you're not bothered by style and are happy to plough your way through amateurish writing then by all means enjoy the book."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I was excited to read this book and learn a little more about heaven. Coming from a Catholic perspective, this book was very difficult for me to accept, since the author is blatantly praising the lord all the time...it gets old and seems so phony. I feel a bit misled, the part about heaven was very brief. I think this book is more about overcoming adversity and a hopeless situation. The author finds a new purpose in life and tries to comfort others, those who are dying, those who are grieving, and those who went through the same painful surgery. If you are Baptist, this would be a great book for you. If you or a loved one are going through a terrible recovery, this would be a great book for you."
3,A small chapter in Heaven,I was disappointed to realize that after a few paragraphs the 90 minutes was over. The rest of the book describes his recovery from the accident.
2,Not what I expected...,"I also agree with what some of the others are saying...this was not at all what I had expected. I have read MANY books like this and I always finish them within a day because I'm so interested but I have to be honest...I got a little bored with this one (sorry!). If you're looking for books on near death experiences (NDE), I would not recommend this at all; there are much better options out there. However, if you are looking for a story on what happens AFTER the NDE, then this might be for you."
2,Not what I expected,"I also think the title of this book is misleading. This book was given to me as a gift after my parents were in a car accident (Easter Sunday 2006) that killed my father, and left my mother seriously injured. I couldn't bring myself to read it until now. What a let-down. I expected to read about a heavenly experience, and instead read about the trials and tribulations of a pain-staking recovery. Most offensive is the reference to Hell and how many of us seem to be headed in that direction. Hmmmmm - interesting. No offense to Don or his fellow Baptist ministers, but the only judgement I am worried about is that of God. If you want spiritual uplifting, try reading The Shack. Although fiction, it made me feel closer to God, and gave me this intense desire to nurture my relationship with Him."
3,At this particular time I needed more information about Heaven and now so much on what occurred after the return to earth,"My mother had just passed away and I really needed to soak up information about where she was and whether or not people went straight into Heaven. I thoroughly enjoyed the pages with this information but, I guess under the circumstances, I needed tons of information about Heaven and not so much on events that happened upon the return. There was one particular sentence I now keep repeating to myself, ""How can you lose her when you know where she is?"" and I thank you for giving me that to hold onto."
4,good,good bookgood storytoo many words required for this reviewtoo many too many too many too too many
5,Awesome,I read this book and enjoyed every page. Have passed the book on to family members to read. Just so inspiring and uplifting. Highly recommend.
5,Great Book!,Great Book! It was given and recommended to me by my grandma and now I have recommended it to my mom and roommate.
4,Only God Knows,"I have read many books about near death experiences and found that most people whose death was interrupted didn't want to return, but came back because of some unfinished mission in life. I strongly suggest reading ""Into the Light"" by John Lerma, M.D. (his first book circa 2007). His credentials speak for themselves. We all need to work on developing love towards our neighbors even if their actions don't agree with our interpretation of the Holy Book. For God's supreme law is to love God and our neighbors as ourselves. Of course, we need to have self-love before we can truly love our neighbors. Hate in the name of God is an oxymoron. They cannot co-exist."
2,Title is Deceptive,"Although this is a story of miracles and divine intervention, it is not primarily about the author's time spent in heaven. There is a very short description of that, and the rest of the book is about his accident and recovery. I didn't buy the book to read about his earthly experiences. I wanted to read more about heaven. If this is the story he wanted to tell, he should have chosen a more accurate title."
4,Inspiring book,This book is well worth reading. It mostly describes a mans horrific auto accident & the suffering he went through for recovery. In the beginning he describes dying & spending 90 minutes in Heaven where it was difficult to describe in words the beauty & music & goings on there. I enjoyed reading this book & it inspired me to see how much strength & faith this man has.
2,very disappointing,"I just bought this book a couple a days ago and it did not take me long to read it, I am honestly thinking about returning this book and getting my money back. I felt that Mr. Piper dealt more with his recovery than with the time he spent in Heaven. Now if someone is looking for a book that deals with the strength and courage of someone who is overcoming a terrible accident, well then this is the book for him/her. But if someone is looking for a book that deals more with near-death experiences and the detail of those experiences, this book will prove to be very disappointing. This book left me hanging, whereas it did not give me enough proof of whether or not Mr. Piper truly did have a near death experience. In my opinion he never truly did die, but rather the paramedics made a serious mistake in determining if he was alive or not. I have read other books on near death experiences and this one I must say was one of the worse!"
1,Didn't care for....,"Was not up to my expectations. Nice story - and most likely true, but did not care how it was presented."
3,Good Read,"Let me preface this review with the fact I am a lifelong student of religion, with a emphasis on denominations. Due to that study I am a Unitarian. I also differ with the author of this book who is a Baptist, in that I believe when we die we are silent and know nothing till God calls us back.That said I also believe that God can do absolutely anything that God wants to do. Obviously God does take some directly to heaven. I believe this author when he says he visited heaven. This book, would be a great comfort to give to those who have just lost loved ones or are maybe facing death themselves."
1,WARNING be careful what you order,"I loved 90 Minutes in Heaven: the True Story of Life Beyond Death; it's a thought-provoking, comforting book. 90 Minutes in Heaven: the INSPIRING Story of Life Beyond Death, though not noted as an excerpt, provides only 5 chapters of the original 19 and misses the complete arc of Mr. Piper's story."
2,Repetitive and poorly written,"I was not impressed by this book for the most part. I think he tried to stretch the story in order to fill more pages because sentence after sentence basically said the same thing. For some reason I kept reading it though, maybe to see if it got better. It didn't."
3,90 Minutes in Heaven,"I had hoped for more, based on the title. It was interesting and reassuring to hear the author's experience ""in Heaven.""However, what overshadowed the entire book was his whining about his injuries and road to recovery. The focus here was clearly a telling of his difficulties on earth. It would have been more inspirational had he focused on his ""90 Minutes in Heaven."""
2,It was not what I expected.,"Reviewer: Ferell Anderson The book was titled 90 minutes in Heaven and that is what I wanted to read about, but it wasn't given. Even so, it is interesting to see how God works."
3,Good Heavens!,"Don Piper's inspirational book has direct relevance to my own situation. My cousin, Dwayne 'Bubba' Richie III, was a well known televangelist from Alabama who died last November from the stress associated with his passionate pastoral care. The indecency charges brought against him by several widows in his congregation, ultimately dropped because the evidence simply didn't stand up, certainly precipitated his passing, as did the investigation into a rather generous 'donation' that found its way into his Cayman Island bank account. After reading Don Piper's compelling account of his return from Heaven, I am left with an abiding feeling of disquiet. It is based upon the terrifying anticipation that at any moment, 'Bubba' could reappear in his polished suit and fake tan and again hustle his way into gullible hearts, minds and pockets."
1,Big Disappointment,This book was such a huge disappointment. It was so boring and did not ring true to me at all. I would not recommend wasting your money or time buying or reading this book.
1,This book is a crock!,You might as well read The Celestine Prophecy as this joke of a book. Don Piper is NOT John Piper. John Piper gets it right...Don Piper does not. Don't waste your money on this book!!!
1,90 Minutes in heaven,Are all you crazy. Sentimental garbage. There is no heaven( in the extra-terrestail sense) but there are mind delusions. Many people have survived great injuries-including me but aren't savvy enough to write a book and give it a catchy title that hooks people. Good marketing but nothing more
5,90 Minutes in Heaven: A True Story of Death and Life,This was a very good book. Hard to put down. Answers so many questions I had about heaven. He explains everything in detail.
2,He doesn't even talk about his 90 minute experience!!!,"He talks all AROUND his experience in heaven, but NEVER talks about the ACTUAL experience!!! I bought this book to hear about heaven, and it's about his recovery and his accident... He just keeps on talking about how its too amazing and then if you really want to hear about it, you have to ask him in person. For someone who claims to care about helping others, I found this terribly cruel. His title is misleading. It should read - My Experience after Going to Heaven."
5,Hendy,"Great read, makes my recovery from brain tumor small in comparison. Should have it on your ""to read"" list. Google Don Piper and check out his web site."
3,Interesting Story,This is an interesting book. Written at a very simple reading level. There could have been much more detail in the timing of events and the healing process. Sometimes confusing when discussing the medical care. It was good that the author decided to share this experience with others. Many people will not accept his experience as truth and others will. I hope that today he is living a pain free life.
5,very interresting book,"As a medical professiona,l appreciated the authors perspective of his injuries and recoveryAs a person I appreciated his experience of heaven"
3,90 Minutes in Heaven,"Interesting story; however, I got a little bored. I thought he could have spent a little more time on heaven instead of his illness."
2,90 Minutes in Heaven,"If this had been written by someone other than a member of the clergy,I might have believed it."
1,fraud,I often wonder if people like Don Piper have any idea how God feels about lying and creating a fictional acccount of heaven just to make money. I purchased two of his books and both have been discarded. I can't believe any company would publish his books.
2,"It was okay, but Glad it was Free","The Kindle formatting was challenging. Most sentences ended with a period immediately followed by the first letter of the next sentence. No space between.Other reviewers have talked about how little of the ""heaven"" experience is described. The author refers to a tape recording and various sermons given at churches across the country. I wonder if more information is given in these than in the book. I believe that this author may be like most people: able to speak, but writing is not a comfort zone. The interaction of speaking and watching those listening provides feedback which then allows the speaker the opportunity to expand.I do like the way this person seems to have found a way to connect to people who need to hear the experience to continue with life, both through the heaven visit and the method used to heal. What I did not like was his continuous ""that's just the way I am and I'm not going to change"" attitude."
3,Could have been better,"Not that great of a book. It could be better if written by someone else. I was always looking back thinking I missed something more interesting. I never found it.The book should be titled ""My Life After Spending 90 Minutes In Heaven"" becuse thats basically what he talks about. Would be better if he described what the heaven he was in was like, other then beautiful. It seems to me he could have went in to more detail about heaven but didn't because he couldn't remember it all that well. The book wasn't that bad the title is just misleading."
3,90 Ninutes in Heaven,It was an interesting book. It was similar to what someone told me that had happened to her.
2,Predictable,Nothing particularly new or absorbing. I don't recommend it for the reader who has read more extensively in this field.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book after the sudden death of my father. The book only talks about heaven in one chapter (which is about 5 pages in length). The rest of the book is a medical diary of the author's injuries, pain and recovery. It tells all about his treatment and therapy while in the hospital and at home. I wanted to hear more about heaven. It also made me feel worse about my father's death: For example, Don states that when he entered heaven, he had no regrets about leaving the past, and had no consciousness of the family he left behind."" In other words, my father (or any loved one who has died) is now disconnected to their past life? It bothers me to think that my dad is not looking over us, as I would like to think."
3,Little bit of heaven,Really liked the start of this book but wished tho he had delved more deeply into his experience.............its a message of hope for sure and I would suggest those that have lost someone would read and be comforted.
5,90 Minutes In Heaven,The book was received quickly and was in great condition. We were very satisfied with the entire transaction.
5,great service,"The book took a little longer to arrive than expected, but the fact that it got here before Christmas is satisfactory. It arrived in good condition. Thank you."
4,90 Minutes In Heaven By Don Piper,"I found this book very helpful especially for people challenging their faith. The first couple of chapters were amazing how they described heaven. I read these chaoters very slowly and carefully to vizualize every detail Piper described. I really enjoyed reading this book and then going back and pondering what was discussed. I would recommend doing the same, to fully understand this book. The rest of the book describes his journey toward healing and all the challenges he faced. It's a very good book!"
3,Too short descripions,"The part about his trip to heaven was absolutluly amazing, but too short,only two chapters. Most of the book was about how much pain he was in and complaining about wanting to go back to heaven and die again."
1,I gave up reading it,"I love to read, and this book was recommended to me. I began reading it; the story is fairly straightforward, but suddenly veered off into Crazyville when the author recounted, over the course of three pages, a giant bowel movement he had. I gave up on it then. I have better ways to spend my time."
2,Disappointed but appreciative,"I agree with other reviewers that this book will be a disappointment for anyone wanting more of a revelation of Heaven than what we got in Sunday School as children. Actually, from my viewpoint, Rev. Piper's description of Heaven is no more revealing than what was given to us as children. Aside from that point, I wonder why Rev. Piper made no comment regarding the generally held view that the human brain is permanently damaged if it goes more than a few minutes (5?) without oxygen. Perhaps that factor would be written off as another part of the miracle? While I do respect Rev. Piper's devotion to the ministry, his courage during long suffering and have an appreciation for the quality of writing by Mr. Cec Murphey, I cannot rate the book more than a 2 out of 5 because it so terribly fails to reveal to me anything as to what Heaven is like,beyond what my Sunday School teachers taught me, and from the title, I was expecting something new."
1,Not that good,This book is 18 chapters and only 2 of them talk about his experience in heaven. The brief description of his heavenly experience is filled with redundancy. The book was mainly about his recovery from the accident. I couldn't finish the book.
3,90 Minutes in Heaven: A True Story of Death and Life,"This book contained some wonderful descriptions of this man's amazing experiences during his short visit to the Kingdom of Heaven! I was hoping the author would have paid more attention to the details of this time, and that he had devoted more time on this subject....but, much more of the book was devoted to describing the horrific accident he had suffered and the seemingly endless recovery process he had endured. I was a bit disappointed and frustrated by this, because his time in Heaven was what I was expecting to be more fully described. Oh well."
4,You can't help but believe!,"90 Minutes in Heaven: A True Story of Death and Life, by Don Piper An extremely well written, totally convincing book. How could anyone doubt Biblical promises after reading?"
3,Interesting but disappointing,"I was thinking about buying this book when I came across the audio book. I was so thrilled and looking forward to listening to the CD Book while I drove from Southern California to Central California. So, you can imagine how disappointed I was because I was expecting the book to relate more to what the title implies. However, the primary revelation of his experience in Heaven is limited to Chapter 2. The majority of his narrative concerns the extent of his injuries; his suffering and lengthy healing process; his compassionate ministry to those who had also suffered the painful healing process and the possitive affects that people have experienced as a result of hearing his testimony. The story jumps around quite a bit and seems somewhat disjointed. While it's all very interesting, I feel the title is misleading and consequently, I gave it 3 stars."
5,90 MInutes in Heaven a Delight,This book was very helpful to me. I just had a dear friend die of pancreatic cancer and she was only 43. Even though my friend and I are Christians it was helpful to know what heaven is like and that death is only the beginning to a wonderful existence. This book has helped me get through the grieving process.
2,90 days in the ICU,"While the title ""90 minutes in heaven"" sure is a grabber for those of us seeking enlightment about the hereafter, this quick read should have been titled ""90 days in the ICU"". If you are seeking insight into and minutial detail of hospitalization followed by details of an arduous recovery after a horrific accident, buy this book. After the first chapter, there's not much ""heavenly enlightment"" to be found. The book is clearly written by clergy -- undoubtedly with the best intention. However, his depiction of his time in heaven is painted through the prism pulpit oratory, which certainly must appeal to evangelicals. Otherwise, how this made the Best Seller List is a real puzzle."
1,90 Minutes in Heaven,"Whine, whine, whine! This book was very boring and spent 90% of the time whining about his accident and ""poor me"". OK.....I understand a serious acciednt and can sympathize with the person. BUT this was way overdone! The title is very misleading. Mabey 5 minutes was dedicated to being in heaven for a couple minutes. I think this author used the title to sell his book. SORRY I bought it and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Inspiring Story but bad delivery,"This was our book club book, and I was looking forward to reading about a person's near death experiences. Having lost a mother, brother, brother-in-law and grandmother before the age of 26, I am no stranger to death and its aftermath.This story of what Don went through was inspring and challenging to my own life. What he experienced, I can't begin to imagine.However.The title itself is misleading. The 90 Mintues in Heaven takes you through chapter 4. After that, it is about recovery, and moving on with life.The writing itself was choppy and wandered back and forth repeating itself. I was hoping with his co-author, that it would have been tighter and more concise. I did not feel drawn into his world or to the story. It seemed to be a story he told to you, not one that he invited you to experience with him. At the end, I was disappointed and thought that it should have ended a few chapters earlier."
2,Disappointing,"For someone who already believes, this book is likely to provide further ""evidence"" for their beliefs.This book won't convince a non-believer, however.As many reviewers have already stated, this wasn't as much about Don's experience in heaven as it was about his suffering.If found it inspirational on a human level, but I remain uncertain about what happens after death."
2,bad title for the book.,"The book mentions this man's time in heaven, but there are very few details about what he experienced in heaven. In fact, his writings never mention that he went beyond the outside of heaven's gates. The book covers more about the traffic accident, his injuries, his faith and his recovery. When the book is entitle ""90 Minutes in Heaven"", I expected the book to describe what he experienced in heaven. I feel somewhat misled. Don't bother buying it if you expect to read details of what waits for us in heaven; there are few details. But, go ahead and buy it if you want to read about the author's traffic accident, his injuries and his recovery."
2,Too much preaching...,"A big disappointment. I very much sensed an agenda throughout the book, and it really is a shame, because it is an experience worth sharing."
1,My 15 seconds in Heaven,"What I DIDN'T care to read about in this book, was the authors medical condition and pain all throught the book. His recollection of Heaven was such a short one, it could have been written on a note sheet."
3,Title of book is misleading,The book was okay but it was more about his painful recovery than it was about his experience in heaven. I'd only recommend this to someone who is battling with their will to live as the result of a serious injury. There are much better books out there dealing with life after death experiences.
3,Misleading title and poorly written book,"This book was all over the place, poorly written, hard to follow chronology of events at times. There's only one chapter that's about his trip to heaven. The rest of the book is about Don's rehab. And the only reason I gave it three stars is because I did enjoy reading about how God used Don to help others (people with leg injuries like himself, terminal people) by giving them hope with his heavenly experience. I was turned off that for a pastor, Don was incredibly negative and pessimistic about a lot of things. Somewhat selfish too. I almost stopped reading it a few chapters after the heaven chapter, but read the entire book because I had purchased it on the Kindle and didn't want to feel like I had wasted that money."
3,Meh could be better,"i read this book in about a day and thats with breaks in between. the story is well written but repetitive. although the journey of the author is very inspiring, it isnt captivating and personally i would leave this book as a book about a near death experience rather than an inspirational and spiritual finding."
5,very pleased!!,"I ordered this book as a gift. Delivery was prompt- used condition of book was excellant- I'm not sure what was ""used"" about it. Overall very pleased with purchase and response from seller."
2,Title is deceiving....,"If you are looking for an inspirational true-life story of beating-all-the-odds, this is your book. If you are looking for an account of how one man's (and really, one community's) faith can move mountains, again, this is your book. Don Piper's journey is certainly inspirational.However, do not look for this book to be dedicated to what Mr. Piper's heaven looked like. I am not saying this isn't a good read, it's just that Mr. Piper's 90 minutes in heaven (which he describes in only one chapter,) is really a spring board from which he enters part 2 of his life. And this book is about his struggle to return to life and ultimately, how his journey now inspires others."
2,God chosen one? REALLY!,"I picked up this book because I was facing yet another heart cath and thought what a good read for me. I also had a NDE and was sent back to human life. I enjoyed the book until the last chapter. SO, ONLY Don was pick by God to tell of his experience in heaven? Others like me are making our experience up? Excuse me, our God doesn't choose just one man to serve him and tell of the afterlife or of HIS love for us. Self serving to make money is what Don Piper is doing here folks. God loves us all. Piper will be in my prayers."
2,Misleading,When i saw this book and the fact that more than 1 million copies were sold i thought it might be very inspiring!Wow what a shock....the heaven experience takes about 2 chapters in the books. The book is about his recovery through religion and not so much about NDE. I wish i would have read the reviews and bought the book for cheaper on here. I will be finishing the book tonight only because i have to finish a book when i start it but i'm very disappointed with it. I expected more i guess.
3,too bibely,"chose this one because I love reading tales of people that have connections to the afterlife.this one is surely different from all the others I have read, but not in a good way for me.clearly a story of a great believer in the bible, wich I don't belive in , though I do belive in a god (just not the bible one). doesn't really tell much about what is waiting for us over there."
4,Well worth reading,"Although this book was not exactly what I thought it was, I enjoyed it just the same. The author's experience with visiting heaven is fascinating and lovely. Most of the book however, is actually about his recovery and discoveries post his heavenly experience, which makes sense since his time in heaven was reportedly quite short. His experience in heaven changed him, and gave hope to others who have lost loved ones. It also gives hope to those who are struggling with any number of life's difficulties. His story is beliveable, nicely written, and I highly recommend it."
2,could have been better,The story itself was a lovely story but itwas ruined by the writting skills and the fact that the writer made some small comments about those who do not believe in god are going to hell. Also some of the story telling just did not match up with what was previsoly said. All in alll could haave been better.
3,"Inspiring, but...","It is very different from many of your ""out of body"" stories -- no tunnel of light, etc., etc., etc. He simply stated that one minute he was driving; the next minute he was in heaven. I actually found his recollection of ""heaven"" to be a bit cloying and didn't really ""feel"" the happiness he supposedly felt while there. However, the story was inspiring."
5,Piper is very honest,Being a Believer in Christ and skeptical of out of body experiences...I was amazed how much Piper's Book matches with The Word of God and how honest he was during his' recovery. I've recommended this book to other people I know.
2,Difficult to follow the story,"The sequence of events in this book are written in such a round-about way, it is often difficult for me to keep them straight. It starts out fairly straightforward - Don goes to a conference, then is involved in a horrible car crash. He dies and goes to heaven and experiences many beautiful and wonderful things. Then the sequence starts to get fuzzy. And maybe that's because it's how the author remembers his experience. His recovery is a mish-mosh of various experiences, feelings, thoughts, people, memories, all jumbled together. A few select scenes stand out, but there's no progressive thread taking you from A to B to C. The author tried to sort most of the story into themed chapters, but many experiences are described over and over, and it's hard to find the stated theme of the chapter in what you're actually reading. It's a great story, one everyone should hear, but the book needs a lot more structure."
3,Not Enough On Heaven,"I was excited to order this book. When I read it though the emphasis was on Heaven I thought but really the emphasis was on his getting over a bad wreck. Not enough insight on Heaven. I guess I was looking for a different story format. I wouldn't order it again, sorry."
2,this book is not a home run,I was expecting a much more detailed description of heaven in the book. the author is a minister and 95% of the book is about other people's stories of how they were almost killed .
3,Have faith,A heart wrenching but eye opening experience. We all have the sane questions that Mr. PIPER has but it is nice to hear he keeps the faith and has shared his faith with others in pain or doubt.
3,Very Misleading Title,Heart-rending story of survival and true faith but very very minimal mention of the heaven experience. Covers in detail his physical and mental recovery from a horrible car accident. Not at all what I expected given the title.
2,Heavyduty,"Mr. Piper had a horrific automobile accident, his pain was/is horrific. But, the title of the book is ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" he talks about it throughout his book but he never tells about it.... He should have title the book ""I had a horrific car accident"" My objection is as a Christian, I would be telling everyone, and would have included it in my book. The book is being sold under ""false premise"" hes a wonderful speaker, writer, but tell the story after all that's what God wanted him to do.... Amen"
3,Somewhat Disappointing but Still Inspiring,"This book is 205 pages long. His experience in heaven is described over only 14 pages! The remaining 191 pages is his struggle to recover from his traumatic experience. Although his glimpse of heaven was very brief, I'm grateful that he did not fill the rest of the pages with untrue descriptions just to satisfy the reader. I believe his NDE was real and I applaud him for his mental and physical endurance. I do however think that his story could have been told satisfactorily in a newspaper or magazine article."
3,Much better in person,"I had the pleasure of hearing the author talk about his story and answer questions for 2 evenings. If I were rating that time, I would give it 5 stars. Unfortunately the book is the ""lite"" version where little detail is provided in comparison to the amount of information that he can actually share when asked. I'm not sure why there is this difference.An interesting note is that he does not consider what happened to him to be a near death experience, but an actual death experience. He was pronounced dead at the seen by 4 different EMTs (not gone into in that detail in the book) and as such was given no medical treatment for 90 minutes until he came back. Based on the severity of his injuries, (some body parts were no longer attached to his body) he would have bled to death quickly if he had still been alive and not received immediate medical attention."
3,Heaven sent,"Having lost my husband recently the first two chapters of this book were the best for me, presenting a picture of heaven and I could imagine my husband being happy there. That picture has helped ease my heart and the pain of his loss. The rest of the book is fine, depending upon your religious beliefs. I've passed it on the others who have suffered a loss and their feelings were the same - the first two chapters are worth the cost of the book."
3,"Wow, Heaven!",I enjoyed reading Don Piper's description of his exposure to Heaven -- and that he didn't want to come back! I found it to be a very interesting sharing of his transition from anger and bitterness to acceptance and service.
4,Inspiring,"A quick read, inspiring. I have to agree with some prior reviewers that it jumped around a lot disrupting the time line. It would be a great book for anyone who's lost a loved one or who is dealing with impending death."
2,"Interesting but light on the ""heaven""' experience.","Not a bad read but hardly as inspiring as many NDE type of books. Believable but too much time spent in ""recovery"" mode and how the author rehabilitated himself. It's like being disappointed at a carnival after spending your hard earned .50 to get into a show on ""weird"""" people. May be a decent expenditure if this is your first attempt into this type of writing."
1,poorly written and pompous,"Although he often tries to act humble, you get the feeling that Mr. Piper is actually quite self-centered and a bit arrogant. I was particularly turned off by his judgmental attitude toward non-Christians. I personally don't believe Piper actually saw Heaven. I think he never really died and was just hallucinating."
2,Misleading Title,"When you read the title, you expect to read about this man's experience in Heaven and that's not the case at all with this story. He spends a whole 4 pages discussing what he THINKS is Heaven and the rest of the book goes into detail about the crash & his recovery. If it wasn't for the fact I only gave a few bucks (less than $5) for the book, I would have been screaming for a refund!"
1,VERY HARD TO GIVE ONE STAR ABOUT HEAVEN...BUT...IT'S NOT ABOUT HEAVEN,"As I said in my header it is very hard to give a book about heaven one star. The title makes you assume that this book is about heaven and what happens when you die but Rev. Piper actually only wrote 5 - 6 pages about heaven and the rest was about me, me, me. He spoke about his recovery which I know was and is very hard BUT he indicated in his title this book was about heaven. I checked this out from my local digital library so I am very happy I didn't spend any money. If he had given this bok a different title telling the real reason for the book I think it would have been much better. Would I have read it then? Probably not but then I wouldn't be giving it a bad review either."
4,Mistitled,"This is an intriguing and compassionate story, but so FEW pages were devoted to the experience in heaven (16 pages) and so much of the book (205 pages) is devoted to the minister's medical, emotional and social recovery, a more honest title would relate to his recovery...but that wouldn't sell books, would it? As a believer, I have no trouble believing his heavenly experience was real ""whether in the body or out of the body, I know not."" My objection is that the title misleads us to hope the book is about what the title suggests."
2,Disappointed,"I pick up this book at the local library and was excited to read it. After chapter 5 though his journey to Heaven has stopped and the rest is about David Pipers recovery in the hospital and at home. I came into this book thinking it would not be the religious type but a lot of it is focused on religion, God, and Jesus. He is not pushing his readers to believe in religion but the quotes in every chapter from the Bible was a bit much for me. The stay in heaven was short and brief in the book. A lot of it seemed like what he thought Heaven would look like considering his religious beliefs. If you are going into this book to read about what Heaven is like it is very brief. The rest of the story is about his recovery and overcoming of depression. A good book for those who have lost ones or have been in accidents themselves but the religious context is too much in this book for me."
2,90 minutes in heaven: a true story of death and life,"I personally was disappointed in the way this book was written, reason being, It kept repeating itself chapter after chaper as if to fill in space. The same information from the chapter before would be repeated as to the details of what he had to go through. After a few chapters its: I get it, I get it already, now go on with the rest of the story. In my opinion, it is poorly written."
4,Helps to Keep Your Eyes on What's Eternal,"Touching account of one man's recovery from death, his brief visit to heaven and the affect it is having on his life as well as the lives he encounters."
4,A glimpse of heaven and God's eternal love,I loved the emotional honesty and messages of faith in this book.God is real.This book has much to offer people who are interested in a glimpse of heaven and how God makes living with pain meaningful.
4,90 Minutes in Heaven,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about the afterlife. I felt that Don Piper didn't write enough about his encounter with death. However, I gave it four stars based on the fact that it taught me to get my mind of my problems and be more appreciative of the blessings God has bestowed..."
5,Life Changing,"Actually I ordered this book for my son who is going through a trying experience at the moment. I lost my husband 6 months agounexpectedly and was given this book by a friend. I was comforted in many ways the last 6 months but none really gave me any relief until I read ""90 Minutes in Heaven."" I believe myhusband is o.k. and I can't wait to see him again when I makemy journey to Heaven. This is a life changing book and I recommend it to anyone who has lost someone dear to them."
1,Misleading,"The description of this book is very misleading. As the others stated his description of heaven is very limited and the remainder of his book is whining about his condition. It goes into great details about his treatment and frustration. It was not at all what I expected. I would be more appropriate in a category of ""self help"" for those with a long term illness."
1,Amazon Rip Off,"Check the other reviews and you'll see..... I'm new to eBooks and Kindle and really miffed that Amazon should rip me off - over $9 for a few pages. This was no book, more of a Newspaper article. Great faith, great life testimony, and a really uplifting piece on the life hereafter for which, with faith, we may hope. But it's all over in almost Chapter One. $9 bucks for that !!!Amazon, if this is the way you intend to market eBooks, forget it - I'm off to Apple Ipad. (Yes, a refund would help)90 Minutes in Heaven: A True Story of Death & Life"
1,He wasn't dead!!!,"Jesus you people are idiots. The man was not dead. Here we have EMTs in some godforsaken Texas county that doesn't even have a coroner feeling this poor man's wrist pulse and not detecting it and pronouncing him dead. Level of education and training, anyone? Any first-year medical student could tell you that the absence of a manually detectable pulse is very far from evidence of death. They should be fired and sued for neglecting his care based on such cursory examination. A living body in shock and maybe coma can display no manually detectible pulse. He was alive the whole time and dreaming. Let him tell us something about his experience that is verifiable but that we cannot otherwise know, then we could believe him. Very convenient that both he and his prayer-buddy are Baptist ministers. I wonder what a Hindu or Bhuddist or atheist would have reported in the same circumstances. Don't be so gullible."
1,No LORD in his Heaven,"Let's see, if I remember correctly to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. It is appointed to man to die ONCE, and AFTER THAT...the judgement. But strangly, poor Don did NOT see the Lord in his version of Heaven. Nor did he experience the judgement.He talked mostly about his recovery and very little about this great place called Heaven. Well, lots of Baptists are throwing out large parts of the Bible that do not fit into their experiences or agree with their prejudices. Looks like ole Don Piper has thrown out much of the Bible that did not agree with his experiences. Unfortunately, it looks like many non-critically thinking pseudo-Xtians are doing the same thing. It is any wonder people laugh at Xtians in general and Baptists in particular.So sad for the people who believe this book is legit. Just more confusion in the christian world. So very sad for believers. Not recommended for any believers with a brain."
1,Whoa,"Maybe Heaven is what you make of it, but he lost me as soon as he described the Pearly Gates and the streets paved with gold.Whoda thunk it? God is materialistic!"
4,Fascinating Story,"90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN: ""A TRUE STORY OF DEATH AND LIFE"" BY DON PIPER WITH CECIL MURPHEYis the amazing experience of the author during and after a car wreck in which he died. He was declared dead by medics and ignored for ninety minutes while they cared for the other victims who were injured. During this time he experienced the bliss of heaven. Don vividly describes his amazing experience and his return to a life filled with physical pain. As a minister, he was able to share his experience and commute his pain in order to help others, especially ones who have had to endure the same excruciating physical treatments for severe injuries. As told by writer Cecil Murphey, Don's experience and the lessons gained are fascinating to read and uplifting to witness. I couldn't put the book down!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book because the title said ""90 Miutes In Heaven"" and that led me to believe it was a book about the authors time in heaven. There was only one chapter on his actual time in heaven. The rest of the book was all about his recovery and the miracles it took to get him well again. It was inspiring and there were some truly amazing miracles that happened. Though, over all, I felt mislead by the title and disappointed."
2,Not what it could have been,"Wouldn't you think that having an opportunity to view heaven would make you a better person? Seeing what is waiting for you should make you yearn for it, not grouse about not being there. Piper suffers from a huge dose of ""meism."" He doesn't seem to grasp that heaven is not about him, not about a family reunion, but about Jesus. He says he is a pastor, but he doesn't do very much ministering to others. He is too busy ministering to himself. Nonetheless, it is my hope that this book will make others yearn for that fair city."
1,Should be called 'Recovery from a Horrible Accident',"This was a disappointing book. The vast majority of it deals with Don Piper's recovery and a very small portion about his 90 minutes in heaven. It took me significantly less than 90 minutes to read the portion on his actual recollection of heaven. I believe his experiences actually happened, but I was left completely unsatisfied. If you are looking for a good book on heaven read Randy Alcorn's Heaven. Randy may not have had a near-death experience, but everything in his voluminous book is bibically based and well researched. You'll feel more satisfaction at the end of the book, trust me."
5,90 Minutes,this book really opened my eyes to the reality of Heaven. It was so very real and clear. Great book!!!
3,Amazing Story,"If you like true stories of life after death, then you'll enjoy this amazing story if you can put up with it's repetitive writing."
1,No Good,I was excited to read this book about someone's experiences in Heaven. What a disappointment! In the beginning of the book the author kept repeating how happy everyone was to see him and how loved he felt. It was redundant. I didn't even finish reading the book because I thought what I had read so far was a lot of fluff. I wish I hadn't bought this book.
3,Does God Allow Suffering,"Mr. Piper's book was inspiring in the beginning when telling about his vision of Heaven. His miracleous return to life after being in God's presence in Heaven was enough to make anyone rejoice especially if you are a believer. We wonder why this happened. Who are we to question God??? I believe that Mr. Piper was saved to be a testimony not only to witness about Heaven but to be an inspiration to others that are suffering from similiar accidents or sickness, or have lost loved ones and are experiencing difficulty in accepting their demise. I believe he is fulfilling his mission. In the last chapter he expresses how he is anxious to return to Heaven."
2,Not what i expected.,"This cd has got some good songs on it and some really bad ones. The good ones like ""how they getcha"" and ""dig a hole"" (best song on the cd) Their are about 5 good songs on the cd out of 12. If you like a mellowed out Vandals then you will like this, if you like the more punk vandals, then check out their Live Fast Diahrea cd or When in Rome do as the Vandals."
1,horrible,Absolutely the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made. Amateurish grainy images repeated ad nauseum boring muzak no commentary. Save your money
1,This is certainly NOT Tango!!!,This CD is a mixture of many things. The music is somewhere between Salsa and Disco. The singer is more Bolero oriented. The only resemblence to Tango are the song titles. Extremely dissapointing!
2,"Marginal, Nothing Groundbreaking","This was OK, but contained nothing new or groundbreaking - what I would call ""Master of the Obvious"" advice. I was really disappointed that the author even had a chapter advising that improving your looks would make you feel better. What was bad about the advice was she used as examples a man who got a face lift and a woman who paid a professional shopper to completely overhaul her wardrobe. Come on, Mira, get a grip!!! It was at this chapter that I lost all respect and to me the book lost credibility. I still can't believe she would include something so shallow. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price for this."
4,Simple principles to give you more energy,"Here are the teachings of this book summarized. Here is how to have more energy:Quit worring about other peoples expectations. This is a huge drain on energy. Live up to your own standards.Do things daily that are meaningful. What are your priorities?Pray in a meaningful way, have a dialog with God.Do what you really want to, stop doing what you do not like.Imagine what you will be like with emotional energy. Make it real in your mind.Look forward to a bright future.Have fun in life!Don't cry over spilt milk, move on.Envy is poison and Guilt is Stupid.and much more, very basic teachings that are common sense but we all need to be reminded of these things. If you want to examine these areas buy the book, if you know all of this, keep looking else where. This book is very basic."
3,Meh,"It's an english 101 textbook. the class in and of itself is pretty remedial. I read one chapter in the book so far, and haven't opened it since"
2,Senseless,"This book tries hard to bring in a cinderella touch to draw the story together. It doesn't work. They meet at a masked ball, fall into lust. Time and miles later they meet and again fall into lust. Oh, and cinderella is rich. As some kind of modern day fairy tale, it fails miserably. Too bad, interesting idea."
4,I love journals!,"I received this journal for my birthday a few years ago. I am still writing in it. I love it. It is beautiful. The only thing is that it can be a little difficult to write in on the back of the pages because of the way the book opens.The journal opens and closes in such a way that the right side swings around to the front and attaches to the front cover with a magnet. I know that sounds weird, but it is really nice. There is no overlapping or anything, so it is not awkward. The awkward part comes when you are trying to write on the back of the pages. Because of this magnetic closure, the cover is only about two-thirds as long as the pages, so you need to lay the book on a flat surface if you intend to write on the back of the pages. It really isn't a big deal, though. I have enjoyed it thoroughly."
5,Witty and disturbing. Wonderfully acted.,"I bought the video because I am a big fan of Ruper Graves. This is possibly the worst he has looked in a film and most unlikeable character he has played, but my respect for him as an actor grew a notch. The plot is very disturbing, but the witty dialogue and the British humor manage to keep me laughing all the way to the end. Although the tragic ending was expected and predicted, it still comes as a shock to the closure of this funny story."
4,Quirky & Dark,"I just love quirky, dark English movies and if you are a fan of Julie Walters & Rupert Graves, you could not find a better piece to exhibit their talents. All the cast, costumes, sets and locations are fabulous in this true and fascinating period black comedy/crime story."
4,Excellent guide to navigate through HIPAA complexities,Rada provides a unique perspective in that he is both a medical doctor and an authority on healthcare information systems.HIPAA@IT Reference is an authoritative guide to HIPAA.It includes most details about HIPAA and includes numerous graphs and charts. Anyone needing a comprehensive overview of HIPAA should definitely read this book.
5,a classic,We finally had to replace our copy of Toy Story - worn out from being watched so often. Great price for this classic movie.
5,A New Century Classic,Another great purchase from Amazon. Received in a timely manner. Toy Story is a great movie for all ages. I would refer to it as a new century classic.
4,MMs Review,"I bought this as a gift for my grandson, so he hasn't received it yet, but I really appreciate how quickly it came."
5,toy story,Promptly was shipped. Great service and fair. I would use again. Packaging was appropriate as well. Searching for set was time consuming....
4,"I liked it, my preschooler can't stop watching it.","It's amazing that as a parent, I've made it three years before seeing Toy Story. Though I am a fan of Pixar and have seen almost every movie, I tended to stay away from the Toy Story series because I was worried that it was overhyped.I was wrong.It's a lovely heartfelt movie about accepting change and coming together with the people you find yourself with. Also, it has a Joss Whedon co-written script and a heavy dose of humor for kids and grown ups alike."
5,MY FAVORITE DISNEY MOVIE!,"GREAT MOVIE.THE COMPUTER ANIMATED CHARACTERS JUST SEEMED SO REAL.IF YOU LIKE DISNEY MOVIES,SEE THIS"
5,"Unforgettable impression, amazing!!!!!!","I saw this incredible movie in the theater, and got the cassette as it released. I could not stop talking about it. Now i am just speechless!!!!"
3,Good and bad in new version,"if you already own Toy Story, you may be asking yourself if you want his new deluxe version. Well, there is good and bad in this version.First the Good:It looks and sounds great! If you have a good tv and sound system, it will be a nice bump from the first version.A nice second disk of extras.Now the bad:They have made unadvertised changes in the movie. they have ""cleaned it up"" And example is in the original Woody purposefuly gets Buzz's name wrong. at one point he calls him ""Buzz Light Beer."" In the cleaned up version he now says ""Buzz Light Snack."" Ok, not a big change, but it does ruin the joke. It's not exactly the movie you remember."
5,Still Great,"It is amazing that Toy Story was made in 1995. Technologically it still holds up. But more than that, the story is great. Voice acting is strong and it is a movie that will stand the test of time."
5,"Great Movie, Great UMD","I loved this movie when it debuted on the big screen. Funny, charming, inventive and simply brilliant story and animation work makes Toy Story watchable to infinity and beyond! The UMD format amazes me with the beautiful picture and sound quality. Nice job Pixar and Sony!"
4,a classic movie,all i have to say is that its a classic and if you have never seen it do yourself a favor and buy the DVD
2,CD scratched sent back,I sent the CD back because it was scratched and would not play all the way through. I have not heard back from the seller.
3,DVD case was smashed,"The movie and accompanying extra features DVDs were unharmed, but the case was smashed at the bottom. The entire bottom strip was in pieces in the envelope. I don't know what happened during shipping, but I was disappointed that I spent so much money for the case to get broken."
5,awesome video...great price!!!,"have been waiting to buy this video for my 2 sons. was not able to find it in the stores. easy to find this online and at a great price. video came in ""like new"" condition. very happy with this purchase."
2,Iffy.,The copy we purchased would only play on 1 out of 3 of our DVD players. Can't explain why this is. All other movies play just fine. So we rented a copy of Toy Story (same version)from the video store and it played just fine on all our DVD players. It makes me question the video I received from this seller. Something is just not right. I will not purchase from them again.
3,no title,video's fine BUT HATE THE FACT i had to pay 2 separate shipping charges on 1 order of 2 dvds
5,Great movie!!,My son is 23 months old and he loves Woddy!! We took him to see #3 movie but he didn't watch it like the DVDS.
5,Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition),"Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition)~ Tom Hanks is an amazing animated movie with a well written script that is about the secret life of toys. The centers around Andy and his toys. Andy has a long time favorite toy named woody. Woody likes his situation till Andy gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear and Woodys situation changes forever, or so it seems to Woody. The animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995). I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever. The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par. I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars."
5,My Favorite Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this movie!I can't understand why my sisters do not think it is the best movie.When I first watched it in a long time I loved!
5,Toy Story legasy,"I rememeber it like it was yesterday; I was very little, but I remember win my mom first brought the VHS home. She got Toy Story the day that it came out. I had even remembered watching at the movies. I've seen every Disney/Pixar movie since then. Recently I had decided that The incredibles was the best, but now I'm not sure. Toy Story is great. I hope that toy story 3 wont be a descrase to the franchise. Without Pixar I'm not sure that animated disney movies will last much longer. I'm not much on extras, but I found myself watching every little bit that the DVD had to offer. This was diffenently worth the extra 16 dollars and I'm diffenently going to get Toy Story 2 when they release it onto DVD after christmas."
5,My Favorite Disney Movie!,Just a fantastic blend of all the qualities that make a movie an instant classic! This is easily my family's favorite disney/kids movie.
5,Alltime favorite,This movie is a classic and should be owned by everyone. Adults will enjoy this movie and will be your children's favorite. Be prepared to watch it for 3 weeks straight.
5,If You Don't Have This One Get It!!,I had originally bought this movie when it first came out on VHS when my older son was little...I have an 8 year old who was not too interested in watching on VHS...but once I got the DVD and all the extras he wants to watch all the time. The animation isexcellent and looks much cleaner on DVD...It is a must have for any family videolibrary.
4,Watch it again and again,"This is one of the best pixar movies. It's fun, entertaining, and usally out of stock for that matter! It beats Finding Nemo which was funny, but had kids calling clownfishes Nemo at the aquarium. This movie is about a group of talking toys who have to move with thier owner, Andy, andwhen Andy gets a new toy, Buzz lightyear, Woody gets jealous. He ends up having to team up with Buzz to go get o n the moving truck to not be left behind!"
5,disney classic,"My children and I loved this movie. I thought it was very well animated. Disney is terrific in pleasing a child. This movie can easily keep a childs attention. My children watch it over and over again, even my 11 and 12 year old sons love it. It will make you laugh and might even make you cry. I think Disney gets better and better with their movies and this one is definately a must see!!"
5,Stunning blu-ray to own!,"INFO:Played on N. American, Region A/1 PS3. Bough new sealed.THE GOOD:+Delightful to watch in High Defenition!+Looks awesome in blu-ray.+LOADS of extras.+DVD copy included.+Rare steelbook case looks better than original plastic case.+Removable top and back blu-ray tag.+Cool internal case artwork.THE BAD:-Deleted scenes are not what you would expect. (misleading)-Some extras were not necessary.VERDICT:All-around A+ movie to own in any blu-ray collection. A classic. :)"
5,Toy Story,The Toy Story movies just get better and better but I've got a special place in my heart for the first one. Great for kids and adults.
4,Toy Story DVD,"I was very satisfied with the fast delivery of this product. However, when I opened the package, the casing to the movie had been damaged. This could have been due to the mail but the package was not labeled as fragile."
2,Color quality of DVD,I received the DVD and it seems to me that the color/ picture is very bright- almost like a white out through the whole movie. I bought it new or so I thought. I tested it on 2 DVD players with the same result.
3,Gotta love a classic,"This is a great movie and having it on DVD is great because the colors and graphics are much cleaner. I was expecting more bonus features given this is the 10th anniversary edition. It included a few more things than average, but nothing that I didn't already know, or hadn't already seen on a TV special or the original DVD released previously. I would say if you already own it, there's no reason to buy this edition."
5,HOW SWEET IT IS!,I now remember what all the fuss was about. This beautifully crafted work of art is now better then it was before. Not only is the picture and extras outstanding BUT they added a EX audio option so that those of us with 6.1 audio systems can enjoy hearing the back speaker kick in.You'll remember the characters and the interplay (and perhaps some of the plot) but what you'll forget is how it felt to watch toys come to life.It was so great to see again.
5,Astounding Animation and Amazing Storyline!,"I've seen many animated movies where the plot goes nowhere; one would expect the same here because so much time was devoted to the animation. Not so. I've never seen such attention to detail--check out the scuff marks on the bedroom door. I've also never seen a movie that tells such a great tale. I was astonished by this movie while I was pregnant with my daughter, and now that she's into movies, I love that she's chosen Toy Story as her new favorite. Young and old will certainly enjoy this movie time and again--I know I have!"
5,Amazing,Toy Story is an original story about toys who are actually alive and have thoughts and feelings of their own. With voice overs by Tim Allen and Tom Hanks to give the animation its character this movie becomes more than just another animation film. It becomes a part of our own entertainment of what it could be like if we were toys. A must see for anyone of any age.
3,Toy Story,My girls love this. It is played so often that I am thinking of buying another just so that I have a spare incase this dvd breaks! They are such big fans of Toy Story and for this is deserves 5 stars from me.
5,Pleasure to do business with you.,I am very happy with my order and video! The product came earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. :)
5,"Great movie, quick service","I ordered this movie and second one, they're both among my 18 month old's favorites. She loves the animation and even carries the DVD cases around like books."
5,But I am tired of watching it so much.,"My two boys love this movie, they are Woody and Buzz. I do too and enjoy watching it with them. Just not constantly."
5,Fantastic Movie!,I absolutely adore this movie! One of Pixar's best. I have probably seen this movie a dozen times or more and each time it's like I'm discovering it for the first time. Pixar's specialty seems to be making great children's movies that still resonate with adults and Toy Story definitely does that.
5,fun fun fun,love the movie. It has made a wonderful addition to our pixar collection. We have all three and think they are great!
4,good movie,"One of my favorite movies! I've watched it 5 times already, still love it. I use Apple TV watch this movie. The video quality is really good."
5,Instant Classic,The DVD is great- I bought both 1 and 2 for $40 including shipping and am very happy with my purchase.
5,To this day I STILL love it...,"I love this movie. Ever since the young age, I loved it. Being the 1st Digital movie, this deserves to be put in top 100 best movies ever. Woody, Buzz, Mr.Potatoe Head, ect. I love them all. 10 years already huh? Wow. The extras are amazing and this is when Pixar made some good movies. Toy Story 2 comes out DEC.26th AND Toy Story 3 will go into production after the finish Cars!"
5,"IT SET THE STANDARD, FOR ANIMATED FILMS!","This is without a doubt, the best animated film, there is!I saw this classic in the movie theater, with my 5 year old,and we both loved it! Finding Nemo, and Shrek, were reallygood, but don't compare to this one. I'de like to buy ToyStory on dvd, but you have to buy, Toy Story 2 with it, andit's $60.00, and not even in widescreen format! Oh well, I'llhave to watch it on the vhs tape I have for now."
5,One of my favorite movies,"and I got it half price on here. What a deal! I actually bought it to watch with my kids, and they love it as much as I do. If you don't have a copy, you're missing out."
5,Sparkling,"Toy Story earns it's massive acclaim---mesmerizing, humorous, and humanizing. A great story delivered by a snappy screenplay, solid acting voices and superb directing."
5,Classic,Toy story is a classic kids movie that adults enjoy watching as well. I purchased this dvd for my boyfriend.
5,Fun-filled movie for entire family. Toddlers love it!,"My toddler son loves this movie! We got Toy Story 1, 2, and 3 in the same time period and love watching the trilogy in small ""doses"" or long spells. Toddlers love to quote it, sing the songs, and role play with the characters. A good flick! Happy Parent in Virginia"
1,All time greatest kids story - also for adults,"This has to be the greatest kids all-time story, especially for young Boys. Which small boy has never imagined that his toys are real and come alive? Technically this is the film that revolutionized animation. It also brought animation from the ""cutie-cutie"", good always beats evil of Disney, introducing a more up-to-date cynicism, slightly dark & gray material, such as the kid Sid and even our hero Woody - though the latter is the main subject matter in that he is attempting to redeem himself. The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are - except for most humans which is quite ironic and charming) Future generations will love these characters and they will endure forever. Toy Story 2 unashamedly attempts to bring the girls into the action with the lively girl-cowboy character Jessie, and while it is also very successful it just never reaches the freshness found in the original TOY STORY."
1,Never received my product!,I have emailed the supplier and he said he would check on the shipping status- I have not heard back from him (over 10 days ago) and still do not have my product or credit!
2,"Great for Mom and Dad, not so hot for tots","I thought this movie was wonderful - for me and my husband. My 3 year old was scared. I think that the mean boy who lives next door and performs surgery and pyrotechnics on his toys was totally inappropriate for toddlers. These toys walk and talk and have feelings, and the movie actually shows this boy blowing them up or sawing off their heads. My daughter found the fishing pole with barbie legs very disturbing as well. I don't think I will let my daughters watch this again until they are much older."
1,Ordered w/ spanish option but came only english,I ordered this Toy Story Dvd for friends if mine in s. america and specifically needed & chose the one that had a spanish language option but was upset when it arrived to see that it only played in english!!! Uggghhhh!!! :(
3,"Classic boys movie for the video library, cute but flawed","This video was for my daughter, but the way things are, my wife and I have watched it with her several times. I get a little tired of the Pixar formula - similar Randy Newman music, lots of the same voices, similar chase scenes, but these Pixar films are good solid kids entertainment. Pixar also weaves content into films to promote other Pixar films - the often repeated line from this movie (""To infinity and beyond!"") also makes its way into the blooper reel on ""Its a Bug's Life"", and ""Monsters Inc"" shamelessly hawks Pixar toys (the fish, woody, and others).My biggest negative on this film is that it is more of a boy's movie than a movie for my daughter. All the main characters are boys and the only memorable female role is Bo Peep who is trying to seduce Woody and at one point leaves lipstick kisses all over his face (not exactly a role model I'd like my daughter to emulate)."
1,No Drivers for Windows Vista,"Warning, this is a good buy only if you do not have Windows Vista. This camera is only compatible in Windows formats that include Windows 98SE, XP/ME and 2000. the VuPoint website does not have any Windows Vista compatible drivers for this product either."
4,An excellent resource for the striving few!,"This Templar should be knighted for his efforts. Career strategy guides certainly aren't a new concept, but Templar's concise, yet well-explored presentation educates and inspires the prepared reader to greatness.With the proper PR campaign, 'Rules' can easily become a vital resource much like ""The 48 Laws of Power"". Read the sample. If you like that and are persuaded to buy the work, don't hesitate. It is worth it!"
4,Fatherhood statements in print.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. With every rule Richard Templar stated, I kept thinking of all the times that my father told me to ""have a firm handshake"" and ""look them in the eye when you address them"". The only fatherhood statements missing from Templar's work where ""have a marketable skill"" and ""have a safe care to drive"".I would suggest this book to anyone, such as myself, who has been working in an office setting and who, also like myself, seems to just miss out on getting ahead. Plain and simple, work is a game. Know the rules of the game and you get to use them for your own benefit."
2,An Average read,"The Rules of Work provides regular advice to would be managers/bosses however in my opinion it is not a fundamental read. It's basically a ""How to"" book with simple ideas. The reader will find that most rules are quite obvious."
5,If you're only getting ONE.....,"My wife has accused me of having a crush on Carly. At least I'm not fool enough to deny it. Carly has been called the voice of my generation, and she is [along with Carole King].This album is an hour and nineteen minutes of a pure, joy-filled journey over about thirty years, delivered in pretty much chronological order. All, or at least most, of your favorites are here. No point in discussing individual tracks; if you're reading this, you probably have them memorized. It's a good thing that ""Better Not Tell Her"" is not about me; my wife would never believe it was all innocent......I have all of Carly's records. Not everybody will care to. Sad. If you only want one, start here. You will probably get hooked, and want them all. [Unfortunately, a couple are tough to find]. Carly's voice has actually improved with time, and every girl should be lucky enough to have her looks at 60. Essential album."
4,Definitive...,"I believe the Carly Simon has a few ""greatest hits"" albums out there. This, however, seems to be the one to buy. The original recordings have been remastered to sound as good as they possibly can. The twenty tracks provide a comprehensive range of Carly's career - although I don't care for a few of the later songs. ALL of her greatest hits are here, so you will not need to buy another album to get one of her popular songs."
4,"Been there, done that...","I am a Carly fan - always have been, always will. I agree with a couple of the folks who wrote that said, for those who don't own much Carly - get this. That's fine, however for those of us who have EVERYTHING - there is no point in getting this. I think her special songs are hidden in between all of these anyway - ""Libby"", being just one example..I am looking forward to some knew beautiful songs."
4,NICE COLLECTION FOR THE CASUAL FAN,"This is your basic nuts & bolts overview ofCarly Simon's career, with all of the bighits on 1 CD. Anyone who doesn't already owna Carly collection would be well-advised to getthis. However, since she has already released""The Best Of Carly Simon"", ""Greatest Hits Live"",the 3 CD set ""Clouds In My Coffee"", the 2-cd""Anthology"" and the easy-to-find import ""NobodyDoes It Better"" collection, most fans will prob-ably have most of these songs. As a matter of factthe 20 songs here are almost identical to the""Hits"" disc on the ""Clouds In My Coffee"" boxset with 1 or 2 exceptions. It's also a slightdisappointment that ""Attitude Dancing"", a top 25hit, was not included. It would have been a bettercollection with that song and ""It Keeps You Running""instead of so many of her lesser 80s and 90s cuts.But like I said, for a casual fan, this will dojust fine. After all, it IS Carly, and she ISgreat."
5,"ItsBeenWrittenOverAndOverAgain,butNobodyDoesItBetter","I can't think of a better greatest hits CD for fans,and new fans to get into this GREAT artist body of work.I'm so glad ""Love of my Life"" is on the collection.Its played on radio stations almost everyday,along with ""Your so Vain,You belong to me,""(I just HATE the way they cut the fantastic ending when Carly really belts it OUT)and ""Anticipation."" Maybe ""Touch by the sun""and ""Like a river"" will become HUGE HITS, and maybe Carly will finally be voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame,like she should have been voted in YEARS AGO,because NOBODY DOES IT BETTER."
5,GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had to buy this cd because I love Carly Simon. I love this particular cd because it spans so many years. She makes me feel happy when I hear her sing. I'm not young, but when her cd is ""blasting"" in my car,I feel young, and some people look at me, as I would look at someone very young who has their car radio or cd sooo loud, I wonder how can they stand it! All the songs she does are great. I do love the song she dedicates to her mother, who passed, and also love ""Amity"" when she sings with her daughter, Sally. This cd is just wonderful....sure gets me going as I'm driving to work!! And peps me up as I am driving home!! Buy it....you will love it too! Carly is GREAT!"
5,"""My Own Reflections""","Very glad to have ordered this CD. I play it many times throughout a week's time. It truly brings on a mood of reflection. It comtains many good selections, not just one or two. TH"
3,Missing one key hit ...,"The US edition misses the beauitiful ""I""ve Got to Have You"" which is one of Carly's most well known songs. I almost bought this US edition because it is cheaper, but fortunately realised the omission of this key track. Will pay the extra and buy it in Australia which includes this track and a few others not featured on the US edition."
5,"Perfection! New Carly fans, start here!","For anyone who is just discovering Carly Simon for the first time, or re-discovering her all over again, this is the CD to own. All of Carly's most well-known work all rest on this single disc, 79 mins of absolute pleasure. And I encourage anyone and everyone to go with No Secrets and Boys In The Trees next, and trust me, you won't want to stop there! I bought this CD all the way back in 2005, and Carly has been with me ever since. I am now the proud owner of every album she has ever recorded and released. That is what this CD can do for you, she is an angel and her beautiful voice will lift your spirits."
5,Outstanding to listen too!,There isn't a cut that does't keep me from wanting to hear more cut's The mixing is outstanding and I highly reccommendthis album. Enjoy!!!!!
4,A true artist.,"Carly Simon has written some of the most amazing songs such as Anticipation, Let the River Run, You're So Vain, Nobody Does It Better, Haven't Got Time for the Pain, and my fave You Belong To Me. Carly is such and accessible and likeable artist, I admire her talent and longevity. I highly recommend Reflections, buy it today!"
5,Songs to Remember,"One of Carlys' best CDs. Used one of the songs ""You are the Love of My Life"" to dance the mother /son dance at my sons wedding. I'd recommend this CD to everyone."
5,Best overall Carly Simon CD out there hands down....,"This collection is undoubtedly the best Carly Simon CD available. Aside from the fact that two of her Billboard Top 40 hits are left off this set (""Attitude Dancing"" and ""Devoted to You""), this CD has ALL of her VERY BEST stuff. Solid album. Solid singing. Solid and classy Carly. At her best. What more could I (or you) ask for? Get it for yourself or your best Carly Simon fan or friend."
2,poor packaging on amazons part.,"when I received the album, it had a nice big crack on the cover. Love the cd, but amazon has work to do on their packaging.... it dosn't bother me that badly because I generally keep the cds in a cd book, but if I am paying $10 for the cd and a few extra bucks on shipping, it should be in mint condition. I would gove it one star, but I don't have the heart to give a carly simon cd one star, as it's not her fault there are defects in the product."
3,YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THIS,"THE AMAZON REVIEW ABOVE SAYS: 20 songs - every one of Carly's top Billboard charting hits.THAT'S A LIE. THIS DISC DOES NOT CONTAIN ""ATTITUDE DANCING"", A TERRIFIC SINGLE (WITH CAROLE KING ON BACKING VOCALS) WHICH REACHED #21 ON BILLBOARD IN 1975. THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS ALBUM IS...WELL, YOU REALLY DON'T NEED ANYTHING BY CARLY POST 1970'S. (SORRY, CARLY...BUT IT'S TRUE.) STICK WITH THE ELEKTRA RELEASES AND AVOID THE OTHERS. IF YOU FEEL YOU NEED ONE CARLY SIMON ALBUM, CHOOSE ""NO SECRETS"". NO OTHER CARLY RELEASE COMES CLOSE."
4,Births,"There is a wonderful birth* scene in this story of secrets. Secrets that fester, that cause action and angst. Secrets revealed. *Other novels with births surrounded by vehement circumstances of one sort or the other: Rebecca Ore's 'Being Alien'; Sylvie Germain's 'The Book of Nights'; Sheri S. Tepper's 'Shadow's End'; Karen Joy Fowler's 'Sarah Canary'; Tanith Lee's 'Book of the Mad'; and Anne Rice has a wild birthing scene under a tree in a storm in one of her books but I can't remember which one. All these books most interesting to read."
3,Needs less decription and more character development,"The truth is that I was drawn to this novel's title... it sounded promising and upon reading the first paragraph I was mesmorized with the wonderful descriptions and the metaphors. The characters seemed to show promise, but unfortunately they were weakly developed... and what began as a beautiful story of family and tradition (eight praying women), turned into a dangling web of abuse and dementia (Zan)... Indeed, at times the novel reads as if it is two separate stories, the lyrical and fresh tale of Quivera, Elegia, and Annaluna... and the rivalry between Zan and Catorza... To add injury to insult, the beautiful passages about antiques and their worth and history is recapitulated with the later appearance of the secondhand clothing store... In short, the novel was repetitive and although at times alluring, the ending was flat and no characters were redeemed."
1,bleh,"after barely getting thru tokyo sucker punch, i was leery of even picking up another one, but, since I'd already bought them on the cheap... yea I didn't get thru the first chapter. Again, if I was about 13 I probably would have enjoyed this better but as an adult... bleh."
4,A Fitting Sequel,"Just as the James Bond film From Russia With Love improved on the already good Dr. No, so too does Hokkaido Popsicle succeed in comparison with its predecessor, Tokyo Suckerpunch. FUN - that's still the operative word when it comes to Isaac Adamson's Billy Chaka series. Although the mystery aspect is more than sufficent, I think Adamson's best moments as a writer involve the hilarious comedic set-ups that occur between the protagonist and the outlandish characters that populate his Japanese Chaka-verse. Overall, it's a fun book. (Though I do like it, I hesitate to give it a gushing five-star review. I mean, it ain't Shakespeare folks.)"
5,go billy chaka!,"This one is as good as Tokyo Suckerpunch, with the same manic energy and humor. Part of the fun is the many bizarre but believable band names the author creates (like ""Phantom Limb""), and the many pop music allusions - especially from Maki and Aki, the huge twin bodyguards who continually banter in pop lyrics from well-known songs. The journey through Japan's urban underside propels the reader, and Billy's cynicism about the music scene hits just the right notes. It looks like there will be more Billy Chaka books, and I'm already looking forward to the next one."
4,Tokyo craziness through the eyes of a gaijin,"'Hokkaido Popsicle' is a like one never ending inside joke on how a American expat in Japan views the ultra modern and totally wild popular culture of Tokyo. I was such an expat in Tokyo several years ago and the author's observations are extremely keen, and are expressed with tongue-in-cheek humor. He also provides loads of humorous tidbits that only someone who has lived in Japan would appreciate, ... it's like on big inside joke.Now as for the story, it works ... mostly. We have our young American journalist in Japan investigating the murder of a Japanese pop icon. He runs into all sorts of improbably situations and totally wacked-out characters. The story is completely unbelievable. Fortunately the author's deftness at writing readable prose and embellishing some of the more interesting characters make up for all the overly contrived bits.Bottom line: more of a back door satire on modern Japanese culture than a memorable mystery novel. Recommended."
1,OMG WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK,"Ok, So I thought, what the heck I will give it a shot....I love horror films, even B-rated ones, but I must say....THIS WAS HORRIBLE. What a waste of time. The guy who produced this junk needs to seriously think about getting a new job. My 17 year old son has made movies better than this one. Nothing cleaver or original here. No surprises. Plot was horrible. The lines were so predictable. C'mon. Acting was REALLY Bad. Screenwriting obviously is a challenge for the producer, writer, etc. There was nothing that suggested it should have ever been released. I feel sorry for all the actors in this film and I would suggest that they leave this one off their resume's. Of course with Ron Jeremy in the film, what could one expect? What a joke..or maybe thats what it was supposed to be. I hated this film and thought that I could have better spent my time chopping up a turkey...a jive turkey. Perhaps then I might have been entertained. Don't waste your money people."
4,Worth Seeing!,"not sure why all these bad reviews, those people obviously didn't get it. The film does not take itself too seriously.The movie was very funny, and the plot kept me interested all the way through and I also enjoyed the narrator in the movie , who kind of reminded me of ""uncle jesse"" from dukes of hazzard. The film also had a good message in the end, which you don't often find in today's horror films. See it today...if you don't see this it will be a sin!"
1,Comic flop,"Ron Jeremy did play a decent villian in this film, looks like he played a mix between Leatherface and the killer in the Prowler. The movie never takes itself seriously and I just didnt like it any part of it. I didnt really laugh at any jokes, but im sure some people would. I dont know who would enjoy this film but someone out there has too.Ron Jeremy is better in Terror Firmer. If you want to see him at his comic best watch Toxie Avenger 4: Citzen Toxie. Dont waste money on this cheap effort to be a Troma film."
3,Not as funny as I remember,"I remember catching these on Comedy Central several years ago. All the drag was done really well, but the rest of it... I found myself cringing over some of the material. I bought the whole series, but having watched a few episodes, I'm not really drawn to keep going. I'd suggest only buying one season (or better, getting it from the library) to see if it's as good as you remember."
5,Excelent! Excelent! Excelent!,"Audio sounds great, and theres a funny feeling re-living all these episodes that I didn't remembered anymore. They are great comedians and I personally collect these classics because theres a sense of humor that just doesn't exist anymore. Times have changed and this type of ""sketch comedy"" really shows us how much fun we had without violence, sex or any other obscene material that nowadays is needed to make you laugh. Thanks for the sellers and to Amazon for a great purchase experience!"
4,Notebook stand/cooler,"This is avery nice stand. Very sturdy and has several adjustable positions for various screen veiwing positions. I like the four USB ports in the back of the Chill Hub and the fans are not as loud as I might have thought. They seem to take away a lot of heat from my computer. I got used to them and didn't notice them at all after a short while. I had to drill a hole in the front of the stand in order to access my headphone and microphone jacks, but that was a very minor task. There is also a considerable amount of storage space under the computer for access wires and such."
2,Noisy and flimsy,"The fan is surprisingly loud -- much louder than the notebook's fans.The power switch is located awkwardly, in the center of the back of the stand, where it is behind the screen and very hard to reach.While it looks sturdy enough not to break anytime soon, the plastic flexes so much that when you type on a keyboard on the same desk as the computer (not on the notebook keyboard), the computer screen wobbles annoyingly.I got a Zalman ZM-NC2000 to replace the Targus and it is solid, much quieter, and very effective at cooling the computer. The only advantage the Targus has is its adjustable height.Notebook Cooler, Silver, ZM-NC2000"
4,Review,"The chill hub did exactly what it was suppose to do. No thrills or extras not mentioned. After 1 month, one of the two fans is having a problem and takes a while to work. Wish it would have more USB ports. They are all in the back, which once you set it up and start to use really makes it hard to get to."
3,Milder than I remember,"I was a little disappointed in the potency of the product. Just like the deodorant that I bought with it I think maybe these ""....by Dana"" folks may have changed the formula somewhat. Anybody know? Or is it just me?"
4,Unusual and rewarding,"People keep comparing Crumey to Calvino and Borges, I can see the similarity but there's a lot else too - like Sterne, Diderot etc, not to mention Flaubert, whose ""Three Tales"" came to my mind after reading Crumey's ""triptych"". These are three separate stories linked by a theme (""memory, reason and imagination""). The result is a fine read, though disconcerting if you expect a conventional novel. Paul Auster's ""New York Trilogy"" also comes to mind. The last story in Crumey's book is related to his earlier novel ""Pfitz"". I didn't discover this until afterwards but it didn't spoil my enjoyment. Reading ""Pfitz"" before this book might enhance your understanding, but it's not essential. Crumey's evocation of the 18th century in this book is remarkable. He's a unique and strikingly unusual voice in contemporary fiction."
3,WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE ABOUT?,"I BELEIVE THAT IT IS A SHAME THAT THE CADILLACS FINALLY GET ATTENTION AND ADMIRATION FROM THE AMERICAN MUSIC WORLD (ROLLING STONE) AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF GREAT MUSIC. WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THAT THE CD THAT IS RECIEVING SUCH LAUD IS THEIR (WITHOUT A DOUBT) WORST! CRITICS SHOULD HAVE ACCLAIMED VASOS VACIOS. THE LATTER ALBUM IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE GREATEST SKA/ROCK ALBUMS EVER. (INCLUDING ALBUMS IN ENGLISH). FABULOSOS CALAVERA IS SIMPLY OKAY. MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THEY SOLD OUT THEIR FANS TO GO FOR A ""DIFFERENT"" STYLE. THAT ""DIFFERENT"" STYLE HAS MADE THEIR LATEST ALBUM A FEW TIERS LOWER THAN VASOS VACIOS."
3,NOT THE BEST OF THE CADILLACS,"I'm one of the biggest fans of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs but I have to admit that ""Fabulosos Calavera"" wasn't the best production of them, we have to understand that they can play the same kind of music forever and they tried to experiment with another style. Finally I'll say this "" It is not the best album, but it is not the worst, either, because they don't have a bad album"" Soy uno de los mas grandes fans de los Fabulosos Cadillacs pero tengo que admitir que ""Fabulosos Clavera"" no es su mejor produccion, pero tenemos que entender que ellos no pueden tocar la misma musica para siempre, y trataron de ex[erimentar con otro estilo, lo cual no es malo porque gracias a que ellos experimentaron en loas pasadas producciones no hicieron bailar y disfrutar de su musica tan impredecible. Vamos a darles mas oportunidades y pensemos en el pasado. ""no es su mejor album pero tampoco es el peor porque ellos no tienen un album malo""Gracias !"
1,Muy malo. Este es el disco que iba a cambiar la historia ?,"Muy malo.Este es el disco que iba a cambiar la historia del rock ?Mucho marketing, nos quieren vender esa porqueria"
5,Experimental Fabulosos Calavera,"Hace tres años que me compre este disco y hasta el dia de hoy no me he cansado de oirlo. Los Fabulosos Cadillacs siempre fueron tremedos musicos, pero Fabulosos Calavera fue un episodio experimental donde los integrantes de la banda exhibieron su ilimitada capacidad como compositores para crear musica que a demas de ser variada y original, es de optima calidad. El disco recibio criticas variadas. A pesar de haber ganado un grammy y de ser alabado por una serie de revistas populares, muchos de los fans que crecieron con la banda quedaron decepcionados. Aun que Fabulosos Calavera no es una representacion musical con la prototipica asociacion que existe de los Cadillacs, el disco no deja de ser exelente. Ambos fans viejos y nuevos deberian desarrollar el oido para la musica de este disco."
3,Needs Spanish lyrics to confuse stupid people!,"Good but not great, Vasos Vacios was a lot better. Great to listen to while viewing NBA games from last year's playoffs. Needs Spanish lyrics to educate the less fortunate people about our culture. Hopefully their next album will go back to their original style so they won't loose their fans. If Rolling St*** liked it...."
5,A must have for your vehicle,"This manual is the first resource I go to everytime I need to work on my truck. The information it provides is informative and very helpful. It does NOT give incedibly detailed information about many things but provides the right information to get you started in the right direction. With the slight variances manufacturers make from year to year. (i.e. wiring diagrams, fuse locations, etc.) it would be almost impossible to cover every detail. With this manual, some background knowledge, and some additional resources, you should be able to do any task you have the motivation, and tools, to undertake."
4,Classic Chilton's,"It's not a manufacturer's shop manual, which would be much larger and in multiple volumes. But it does cover the essentials. It did a good job expaining how to change out my truck's hydraulic clutch system. The B&W pictures are sometimes not as detailed as I might like, but you get what you pay for. This particular purchase was a great deal--brand new for less than half price."
3,Pretty good.,It serves its purpose just fine. The only thing keeping me from rating it higher is that I had to sand them before painting them...they were a bit rough in a few places.
3,It's alright for the money,"The three things included in the offer seem to be a really good deal, however be aware that the hands-free is very very fragile. The charger and the case are fine, fit the phone well. However, the hands-free I got broke after the second use. First the answer-button came off, and then the whole mic stopped working. I suggest that you buy a different product if you're looking for a head set but on the other hand it wsa a good deal for the charger and the case."
2,its okay review,"Is a pretty good video, However anyone with a blue belt of higher should already know these chokes. But its great review!"
2,Good for the collection,This is a good CD for you collection. The first five tracks alone are worth money. After the first five it takes a dive. But it continues to stay afloat.
5,For ANYBODY that likes to get down,"Hey everyone,I am a total MUSIC/DANCE NUT!!!! So I must totally recommend this CD. From the first time I heard it until now...It sounds the same-in the sense that GOOD MUSIC sounds good no matter how old or new it is. This one always sounds new...everytime I listen to it. The title track will totally leave you wanting more, as well as my personal favorite,""Mind Magic"". If you like to get down,then you need to check this CD out.This cd takes you on an emotional and physical journey that leaves you with only ONE option... TO GET DOWN!!!!I LOVE this cd for working out, teaching a dance class, or listening to it on my IPOD while walking from here-to-there.Marques Wyatt thanks for all the good music you put out...I can't wait to meet you!!!"
5,High Quality case for N95,"This case provides excellent protection and fits remarkably well. I got the case shortly after purchasing the phone and haven't had to take it out yet. All the cut outs in the black case are perfectly located so you charge, connect to usb, operate the lens cover, use the speakerphone without interference from the case.Curious material - it's odorless, soft and very slightly tacky. Whatever it is, is dimensionally stable and has a quality, durable feel. The two parts slide smoothly. Great product!"
1,"Bad service, low quality product","Bought this case, and paid a premium price for it thinking it is a quality product compared to those cheap ones available on ebay. When I received the package, I was dead disappointed. The slider mechanism on the case seems to be glued to the silicon case, and one side has torn off. I would assume they would check before they ship! Shipping is not covered even if you return it for an exchange. It is like paying for their mistakes!What's worse, the case is loose fitting and an extremely poor fit! Contacted customer service, and it has been 3 days and still no response from them. I guess this is the last time I will ever buy anything from them!"
3,Great half of a book,"Great concept.This is a storyline that is dying to be filmed,but there is only half of a story here.There's an excellent beginning, followed by a great middle, followed by a brief end.I recommend this book,only if you're getting it used."
4,"Solid, Older Memory Card","The new wave of compact memory technology is being led by the Secure Digital (SD) Memory Cards. Supposedly, they have tremendous memory quality while also enabling secure protection of stored data. Yet, being the newer technology, they are also more expensive. For my purposes, I just needed a card to expand the memory of my MP3 player. So, I was more than content to go with the SD's predecessor, the MultiMediaCard (MMC). The MMC has the exact same physical design and can be used in all the same devices as the SD. Its only negative is that it is more primitive technology. It has served my needs quite well. There have been no compatibility issues and the integrity of the stored data has been quite good. I may eventually move up to the SD card, but for now, I have nothing but praise for the MMC."
3,"X-15 Diary not bad, but not complete","A correction to a previous review: this appears to be a simple reprint of the 1961 title, and does not cover flights after 1961. The last flight described is Bob White's to 130,000+ ft. None of the truly astounding flights with the XLR-99 engine are covered. I guess you have to go to Milton Thompson's book for that.Still a good read though. It's interesting to compare the X-15 to SpaceShipOne."
3,Good but outdated,"This book is good for beginning programmers or for those who wanted to learn Java. The book is very detailed about the methodology of programming and such. However, as you continue along in the book (about chapter 3) you start finding more and more code errors in the examples you are working with. It makes it really hard to learn if the examples are wrong. Also, the Author doesn't follow his own rules in his consistancy of variable naming. I wouldn't buy this book if you are trying to learn the most current version of java and techniques. I would buy it if you are interested in learning the fundamentals of programming."
3,Fast and Furious,"I used this text for my first programming class. It jams a lot into 8 chapters (really 7 as the first doesn't hit you with much). I would prefer a little more of a chapter spread. In fact I would say this is a lousy intro to programming book. Now that I have been through a higher level programming class I am going back to this book and finding it more useful. The programming examples are quite complicated and makes a few assumptions on your level of understanding. The programming examples do not have errors as stated in a previous review, but when you are first learning you make typos and don't know what to look for to correct them. I like to type in all the examples for practice but after an hour of compiling and getting nowhere it would be nice to have downloadable files (Instructors can get them). Overall I would say by the time you can understand this book... you don't really need it for the price."
1,Rip off,"i was very disappointed with this stroller. it's huge, the quality is so poor, sewing looks sloppy. Bassinet is not sturdy at all, and it doesn't even properly fit into the stroller.i also had an issue with Everbright costumer service. To return the stroller they charge shipping to you and back plus 15% re-stocking fee. i was aware of that but when the stroller was picked up it was apparently shipped back express. Person at Everbright said that they will charge me more money for the express shipment. i didn't even know that stroller was shipped back express since Everbright arranged for the stroller to be picked up.extremely disappointed. what a rip off. don't waist your money"
5,Oliver is so cut,The movie was in excellent condition and I received it before Christmas so I am very pleased. I purchased this for my 4 month old grandson and he just loves the songs
5,Kids love it,"My kids love old movies and I love them too! Wholesome fun and characters to fall in love with, Oliver and Company is a favorite in our house!"
5,great gift,"Truth is, I would have to ask my wife if it works, but I have no doughts that it does. I've ordered many things from Amazon, and every one has been in grand condition upon recieving them."
4,:),I ordered this as a Christmas present. It came on time and there seemed to be no problems with the disc.
5,Oliver and Company DVD,I bought this DVD for my boyfriend for Christmas. It arrived quickly and in great shape! He loves it and we just watched it last night. I am very satisfied with this product!
3,not bad,"I must say that Oliver & Company is a pretty hip movie about a cat finding a gang of dogs to hang with. The story and music are good, but I felt that this movie was just a little too short. It needed more footage and a little more action as well. Overall, this is a movie that everyone should see once or twice."
5,First favorite Disney movie,Oliver and Company was my very first favorite Walt Disney Movie. I would like to buy this if it goes on sale.
4,Oliver and Company,Product received in a timely manner. The DVD was in excellent shape and serves our purposes.
4,A Disney Masterpeice (literally!),"This movie is wonderful. It is very original, and all of the Characters are Wonderful. It also has a good soundtrack - 'Why Should I Worry?"" ""Perfect Isn't Easy"" ""Streets Of Gold"". The Characters are Magnificent, my Favourites being Georgette -yes, yes, the Snobby, Champion Poodle , Tito, the Hyper Chihauhua, and Einstien."
2,Should have skipped it,I regret buying this dvd. It has some very cute parts and it has some ugly parts. I really don't want to explain to my daughter what happened to the bad guy when he got run over by a train or why those ugly dogs are trying to eat the girl and the nice dogs. I wish they made it more kid friendly.
3,A fun family film for the whole family,"Nearly 20 years later, this 1988 Disney ""Oliver Twist"" reenact remains an instant classic that is enjoyable for all ages. Oliver is a orphaned kitten taken in by Dodger, a cool dog who has ""street savoir-faire."" When Dodger's owner Fagin owes money to mob boss Sikes, Dodge and the gang(Einstein, Tito, Francis, and Rita) try and save the day, but run into trouble when a young girl named Jenny takes in Oliver, which is instantly disliked by the family dog, Georgette. A entertaining and enjoyable family film, Oliver and Company is fun for all and something to watch over and over again."
4,Howling good time,"This is my favorite Disney movie of all time. While those words don't exactly give merit to how great this animated film is, they do explain my excitement over the fact it's being released on DVD. Loaded with features, I can't wait to add this to my collection.A twist on Oliver Twist, Oliver the kitten is orphaned, and left in the street. But he's adopted by a street savvy pack of dogs who help him return to his rightful home.Every single song is timeless, whether it be by Bette Midler or Huey Lewis or Billy Joel, you're guaranteed to be singing them for days."
3,Good but not great ~ ~,"I was glad I found this DVD, we've been looking for it for a while. Overall the quality of the video is not that great, some fuzziness, probably because we played it in blue ray."
3,Old Classic,"I used to like this movie and have the soundtrack, but i forgot what happened. i own this film and its about this cat that gets adopted by these dogs and they try to do something, but i dunt rememeber what. there are these bad guys and these good guys and other plots. one of my favourtes. i havent watched this film in like 5 years...."
1,no show!,I have not received my product and it was mailed August 4th.I have tried everything to try to get this products but no luck!!!!
1,"I hate it,","I happen to be a huge Disney fan but no one can deny the studio was at its all-time low (their only low, actually) during the 70's and most of the 80's. Of all the animated Disney features of that era, The Fox and the Hound is the only one worth mentioning. However, the worst one must be ""Oliver & Company"" (equaled with The Aristocats). Poor quality animation, substandard songs and a weak plot make this among the worst Disney movies ever made. One cannot believe this is the same studio that only a year later brought the masterful The Little Mermaid with its stunningly detailed animation, lush colors and appealing music."
2,Widely considered to be the worst disney movie,"this disney non-classic(it was part of disney's dark age) is widely consideered to be the worst disney toon. Leonard maltin called it "" the grittiest of all the disney movies"" he was far from wrong. This film isnt a poor film, its only fair. I guess all good things do happen after bad things. This film was so bad, that it made sense that "" The little mermaid"" came after it. That was a four star movie. Oliver and company is 2 stars."
1,This movie was hip! (From a first grade point of view),"Back in the late eighties I recall seeing the trailer for Oliver and Company and I got caught up in the hype. Unfortunatly, I didn't have the money to see the film and it was never released to video after it's debut. So when the film had it's re-issue you bet I was quick to see it. I expected an exciting story, great eighties music, and stunning animation. Instead I got cartoon music, overly cute acting, and a poor story. Disney had stapled this film as appealing to the teenage crowd. How? This is most defintely a kid movie. The music was not contempory to its time and the human characters lacked a lot to be desired. Here is what I expected (and in detail!). Great eighties music, a strong gangster villian (preferably Italian), and a guy down on his luck who you could relate to instead of a bumbling bum. But sigh...they had to throw in a cute girl and singing birds. Sigh..."
3,Cute but to much competition,"We rank this 26 out of 41 animated Disney movies that we own. It is an average 3 star movie that the family liked. We with 25 Disney movies that they like better, it seldom gets watched anymore.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4, Sleeping Beauty 5, Snow White 6, Robin Hood 7, 101 Dalmatians 8, Fox and the hound 9, Cinderella is 10th, Rescuers 11, Hunchback of ND 12, Aladdin 13, Aladdin King of Thieves 14, Jungle Book 15, Little Mermaid 16, Hercules 17, Winnie the Pooh 18, Rescuers Down Under 19, Sword in the Stone 20, Pinocchio 21, Mulan 22, Mary Poppins 23, Lady and the Tramp 24 and Aristocats 25."
5,The best of the contemporary Disney Films,"This is one of the only Disney films that I felt didn't insult children's intelligence and the stars that agreed to be in this film knew it. Bette Midler, Billy Joel and others agreed that this film would become a classic and they were right. The music is contemporary in flavor but still appealing to young people. The retelling of Dicken's tale in the big city is the perfect way to present this story to young people. Kudos to Disney."
1,Straps Don't Fit All Moeller Top Side Fuel Tanks,"These straps Don't work with Moeller topside 24 gal. fuel tank! Ship Store finally provided a RA number, and credited cost of the straps But not shipping... Unacceptable, no where did it mention that these strap won't work on all Moeller topside tanks."
2,didnt fit my application,"I purchased these with the moeller fuel tank and i thought they were compatible with the model number but they did not fit the tank, they were not long enough."
1,Not what I needed,"I wish this product's specific model use had been included in its description. Not a huge investment, but worthless for my needs."
3,"Enjoyable,",An appealing middle-aged guy character. About one tenth as funny as curb you enthusiasm. I enjoyed watching it. He is a funny guy.
1,"Flipper discs suck, won't even play","Love the show, but these flipper discs are terrible.My Blu-Ray player refuses to play them. So I bought some very expensive coasters.They need to release this properly on Blu-Ray ONLY."
5,"Slightly ""dark"" hilarity","Firstly, the technical quality is first rate (audio, video, etc...). The style of humor pokes fun at those awkward ""life moments"" as well as revealing our ""shortcomings"" in hilarious and sometimes, absurd ways. Mentally mature humor."
1,SNL must really have some great writers,"If you liked Louis C.K. on SNL like we did, don't go thinking that Louie would be similarly funny on this DVD. Very disappointed in the vulgar talk and constant hip thrusting of simulated humping on both this DVD and Season One of his cable show Louie. We only made it through a few episodes and had to give up. So there goes a few hours of my life that I'm never gonna get back. If you want some really funny comedy that is not vulgar and that you can actually watch with your adult children without being absolutely mortified that you bought this material to share with them, then check out Brian Regan or Bill Burr. Now they are funny! Shareable funny."
1,stupid and boring,"I like his comedy and standup, but the shows usually center around one big laugh hence the plot... but when thats not funny, which it wasnt in the majority of episodes, you feel like you wasted your time. Also, I know I am a bit conservative, and Louis is more liberal, but somehow homosexuality kept showing up in his episodes and it got to the point where I was annoyed by it."
1,"Louie Disc One, The Kings Speech Disc Two??",I ordered Season One of Louie after reading all of the great reviews.Sold by: SpotlightMediaI received Disc One of Louie and the Second Disc was The Kings Speech (which I already own!).Pretty poor quality control.I live in the South Pacific so this error is a bit more than a minor inconvenience.Spotlight Media is definitely off my approved vendor list.
1,Discs only half work...,"This package states that it is a combination DVD/Blu-Ray with one side being DVD and the other being Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray side doesn't work at all on either of the two discs, and I tried it in two different players. The second disc completely stopped working after the 3rd episode. As much as I loved the season in it's first airing, that fact is the only reason I can give this even one star."
3,Funny but dry.,The show is quite funny but alot more dry humor based than his hilarious stand up act. But it still is quite good.
1,CENSORED!?! Are you kidding me right now?!?!,"OK, like most other people here - Love the series, but for some reason the DVDs are CENSORED!?! HELLO!? Are you kidding me? Was looking forward to having this fantastic series uncensored but the bleeps are still there. Sent mine back for a refund. I don't want my comedy censored thank you."
2,DVD Arrival,"SO I love the show. But, Lionsgate put no energy whatsoever into the DVD. I don't mind that the DVD's look cheap. I don't mind the packaging. But be aware that on Disk 2, the episode Flames is missing a large segment about 10 minutes worth. That whole one where Jr comes in with money to buy Flame and the group of them take off to go get him. I tried multiple DVD players to make sure it wasn't me. It wasn't. I am beyond disappointed after waiting years to get the DVD's in the first place. I requested a replacement from Amazon and the same is true again with the new copy. If I hadn't wait so long to get it or could have bought it through anyone else I would have sent it back. I guess I'll have to pray Hulu never takes down the episodes.Sincerely, Mislead."
1,Disapointed,I ordered Wildfire Season 4 I loving the show only to get season 4 and the blue side of the dvd wont read in my dvd player. It takes me like 10 minutes to get it to play. The dvd player is brand new and will read every other dvd but this one. I am disappointed that I cant watch this without having such difficulty.
3,3 stars for quality. 10 stars for the episodes,"Considering how many years it took them to finally release this season onto DVD, they could have actually put some effort into it. It looks like I bought it off the black market. But of course the episodes where great and I love JR and Kris being together <3"
5,Happy,"Got here fast, in original wrapping, and a great series. Could not be happier with the product or the service :)"
2,"Love the show, but not the quality of the discs.","I love Wildfire, but this set just seemed like it was put together quickly. Everything appears to be made cheaply and looks like something I could just as easily make at home on my own computer. :/"
5,WANT IT TO COME OUT ON DVD!,I have the other three seasons and I cannot wait for season four to be released. When is that going to happen? I have been waiting a long time!
4,Wonderful!,"The packaging and set up of the DVDs isn't anything fancy, but it has all the episodes on it which I'm absolutely thrilled about! The only problem I had with it is that on disc two, episode four titled ""Flames"" it's missing a scene between the main four: Kris, Matt, Junior and Dani in the car on the way to the barn, which is a pretty key scene for the following episode. I'm not sure if it applies to every copy of this disc, but it applied to mine.Other than that, I'm pleased with the DVDs. I've waited quite a while for it, so I'm completely thrilled to have it!"
4,Camera bag,"Good one.Big, strong.Feets lot's of things together.Would work for most cameras and comcoders."
5,Bringing yoga to life,Perfect! Enjoying this book so much and it is in perfect condition. Worth every bit of time and effort put in!
2,Scrabble Players DIctionary,Purchase was in good condition but I was very disappointed the words were way too small for the seniors who used this material for their Scrabble Tournament. I would have preferred a larger print Scrabble Dictionary and this edition was not the newest one in print.
1,An impossibilty,"As neither the two dictionaries has arrived I am unable to do this. An e-mail to your Customer Service elicitated a response dated 4.07.11 advising me that the ""appropriate department"" would receive a copy of my letter. Despite four times since e-mailing the courtesy of a response has not been forthcoming.I will be making future puchases with AbeBooks.Gerry Chester"
3,What were they thinking!,"I got a chance to learn ""competitive Scrabble"" from a friend who is a nationally-ranked player. She insisted the road to success in Scrabble (not a burning ambition with me, but interesting nonetheless) is to learn a series of two and three letter words that look like cheating but are apparently real words to the dictionary people. In the older edition, these were separated out so you could spend your time memorizing them. This edition only has them listed alphabetically. So for ending arguments that EX and EL are indeed legal words in Scrabble, it's fine, but lacks that formerly valuable tool. Well, semi-valuable. If you get too good, your casual Scrabble-playing friends and family stop playing with you. This didn't happen to me, but I've heard that it happens.So for home players who love Scrabble, this is a good reference. For competitive learning, get an older version."
3,CRWTH,"With over 100,000 two-to-eight-letter words & 1,000 new entries over the previous edition, this little paperback comes in handy for Scrabble and other word games--even crossword puzzles. All entries are printed in bold caps with brief definitions, parts of speech labels, & various forms of words cross-referenced.I agree with some of the other reviewers on the addition of off color words now being accepted. A sign of our times I guess. Yet, it is fun to peruse & especially easy to handle while travelling.CRWTH? Hmm, a word with no vowels! I came across that one, meaning an ancient stringed musical instrument. A section of other vowel-less words would be nice and maybe Q words that need no U-qat etc. All in all, a good addition to reference collections & keeping a good game fun. In our family we play having to use the word in a sentence!"
1,This book has been replaced by 4th edition!,"Do NOT get this book -- which contains only the THIRD EDITION of the allowable Scrabble words. If you want the FOURTH EDITION, which is current up through its publication in late 2005, use this number to search Amazon's catalog: 0877796343 which will take you to the Fourth Edition, Large Print. For some reason, you can't find it by using words like ""Scrabble Large Print"" to find that edition -- you have to use the ISBN number.Using the older edition might be okay if Amazon starts selling it at a discount; it's certainly good enough for friendly family games (in most families!) but won't get you where you need to go if you are playing competitively, and need the most current list of new coinages, acceptable 2-letter words, and q-words."
4,Toss up but go for it,"First off, if you don't have a Scrabble dictionary and play Scrabble, you NEED TO buy this book. But let's say that you're like me and you have an older edition. Well the older editions had separate sections that listed all those nifty two letter words that can rack up big points (ex: aa, ae, xi, em, jo, etc). But you can find all of those words in the new one, just not listed separately. However, if you're like me and want to use all the new-fangled words like zit then you won't find them in any edition but the new one. I'm sure that there are many other new words in this edition, zit is just the only one that I've noticed so far. It's a trade-off, yoúr choice: the convenience of common-word lists in the older editions or the proff that newer words exist in the new version. I have both; maybe that's your best bet."
2,Large print edition too hard to handle.,"My grandmother is an avid UpWords player. At 98, her eyesight isn't what it once was, and she needs to use a magnifying glass to use her small print version of this dictionary. So I thought it would be a great idea to get her this large print edition. I had read reviews, but didn't see any on this particular version. When it arrived I felt like kicking myself for not considering the size. It's about 8x11, and weighs just about five pounds. Basically it's got the heft of a bag of sugar, but it's twice as unwieldy, being large and floppy. No way on earth my grandmother could handle this.I guess this edition would be good for someone in great physical condition with the exception of poor vision."
1,Missing words!,"""Submarine"" is not a word--according to the OSPD! Apparently, while 9 letter words are possible in Scrabble, nothing over 8 are included here. Such was my revelation when, proudly laying the word ""submarine"", it was disallowed according to this ""official dictionary."" If you use the OSPD to play Scrabble, be prepared to pare down your language."
1,For cheaters only,"That's right, suckaz, if you use this book you are a cheater! You should only be allowed to play words you can actually use in a sentence without consulting a reference. The proliferation of Scrabble dictionaries turns the game into a memory game...who can remember the most bogus two-letter words that are in the Scrabble dictionary?Pick a real dictionary instead, and then only use it when someone is challenging a word. Keep it real, yo."
4,Helpful but...,"This was a very helpfull book that lets you play scrabble better. Even though, when your playing for fun and you use it the game gets boring, so i use it only when i really need it. Still, a great buy."
1,Not enough info,"At first I though the book was o.k. However, now that I'm playing Scrabble with tougher opponents the book is useless. Had I reviewed it beforehand I would not have bought it. Its no better than a dictionary."
5,A Great Workhorse,"You can tell if a dictionary is used for Scrabble. It may have dog-eared corners, loose or ripped pages, coffee stains, a missing cover, a broken spine, and any number of other imperfections. Eventually, it may need to be replaced. This is why The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (Third Edition) is a great purchase. It won't necessarily help you once a word exceeds eight letters, and may sometimes fail on words of fewer letters, but it is certainly an inexpensive way to save a copy of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (recommended for use for words over eight letters) from absorbing a great deal of wear and tear."
3,Not for casual players,"Glancing through this dictionary, I'm thinking it could spoil the fun for us occasional, for-fun players, especially if there are hard-core competitors in the game. If someone studied the dictionary, even briefly, and learned some of the more obscure ""words,"" she/he could win many challenges made by normal word-lovers. Three spellings of ""aargh""? Why is it even in there? And, not that I care, I even spotted a wrong definition for ""yuck."" It says it's the same as ""yuk"" (laugh) but we all know its a variant of ""yucky"" (disgusting). I'm going to recommend to my friends that we use a regular dictionary. All for fun and fun for all."
4,Absorbing and engaging album!,Ken Navarro achieved a particular place among his enormous discography with this special smooth jazz music box. The formidable arrangements and engaging lyrics make of this album an original proposal at the moment to decide oneself to acquire a smooth jazz album with imagination and refined taste.
4,Very Good,"This is the first CD I've bought of his. The music and writing was very good. All tracks except for Stone Soul, are original, which I prefer. Very mellow, laying around the house groovin, sort of music. :)"
3,Could have been better,"After the two Shanachie releases i was overjoyed to see the acoustic wizard return to his in house production with the only final critic being his fine self.Expected more and received it in abundance on latest release ""The Meeting place"".I do understand that those not familiar with previous works will not understand what the hell i'm on about and find this album perfectly acceptable. Acceptable it is The Meeting Place it is not."
2,Customer Due Diligence,Misses the point: customer reviews provide the information a buyer needs to verify the value of a proposed purchase Best example? Amazon's rating system!
5,Chris Dallas Feeney Is A Business and Economics Genius!,"By far, the most intensive and helpful customer strategy guidebook to date!Five stars!!"
4,Made it into the top doll selection,"My daughter got these for the holidays and loved them immediately. She got several dolls and these survived the initial cut of what ones she plays with. After several days, they're still amongst the favorites. That is a substantial statement because she has lots of dolls and thinks she is a mother already. No frills, but she loves them nonetheless.UPDATE - It is now May. These dolls are still her favorites, and they are holding up extremely well. Great purchase for any ""little mama"" in your life. The beaming girl in the picture pretty much captures the popularity of these dolls with my daughter."
5,The perfect toy for your little girl(s),"These dolls are a BIG hit with all the little girls in my family. We got these dolls about 2 years ago for my daughter and she carried them everywhere! Eventually, one was lost and she kept asking for it. I found them here online and had to get two pairs!My nieces in Bolivia want them as well and I'm about to order another set for them. Highly recommended, great toy for your little princess."
2,kinda lame,"The quality of construction of these gaskets was fairly lame. They did the job but just.The outer layers of metal were well separating from each other when the arrived, but I figuredonce they were clamped down between the head the exhaust pipe, the sandwich of material wouldbe held together okay. Price was cheap so you get what you pay for, right?"
5,Pre-Barnabas Ecstasy!,"What can I say, I love Dark Shadows and didn't start watching it as a kid until Barnabas showed up so I love seeing what went before. And what went before was just as entertaining as what came after that landmark. Some tense, fun, creepy stuff which still holds up today. Will hopefully get a chance to collect and see entire series. They did a beautiful job restoring this series."
3,Anubian Lights - 'Phantascope' (Rhythm Bank) 3 1/2 stars,"Took me a little while to land down a copy of this, the latest work from the Anubian Lights. A bit different from their earlier efforts but still decent. Best tracks are the accessible ""Bhajan"", the uplifting ""Way Gone Man"", ""New Wildlife"" (prime new age / ambient), the electronic ""Black Line Station"" and ""Good Morning Spacegirl"". Very nice. Only downside here, I thought was that ""Wild Winter"" and ""Sargasso Sea"" were a bit too artsy-fartsy. Line-up: Tommy Grenas - guitar, bass & vocals, Len Del Rio - organ, keyboards, piano,loops & programming and Adele Bertei-organ, keyboards & vocals. Didn't realize they're now a trio. A should-have."
