2,Disappointed.,"These traps work OK but not great. They are not nearly as effective as the ""older model"" which I cannot find anywhere."
1,The mechanism breaks easily-go for better designed traps from Victor or others,"One of the devices in the two pack was already broken: the bar would not come out of the slot in the metal tab. When a mouse cleaned off the peanut butter in the other trap without triggering the trap, I went to add more and the mechanism went out of alignment. When I tried to straighten it out, it fell apart.Victor makes much better traps than these: better designed for reuse and handling. Go to them."
1,JUNK!!,Complete waste of money - wish I could give these no stars. Peanut butter bait gone - and trap did not go off. Several tries with this happening and wish I hadn't bought 4 of these. One trap was broke upon opening. Wish they would go back to the simple wood / metal version.
2,Missing Traps,"Let me start on a positive note by saying that this trap was easy to set, as advertised. I baited them with peanut butter and put them in my basement two days ago. Here's the interesting part: The trap is missing. The snap on the trap is so weak that I could put my finger in it without hurting, so I suspected this might happen. As far as I can tell this trap does work, but it is not strong enough to kill the mouse; he is likey to die of starvation instead."
1,Product currently shipped is different from picture and past versions,"The currently shipped product (July 2012) is a vastly inferior version of the product pictured. I have 4 of the older generation product and they are truly a GREAT mousetrap. Strong spring, teeth to kill the animal, very sturdy. And they really are a better mousetrap.This new version is smaller, 1/2 the spring strength, and lacks teeth. This thing will, at best, gum the mouse. The mouse will only feel a leg or back massage and will easily walk away from the snap.There are other vendors selling the previous version... you'll have to look around. But the hint is ""look for teeth"". I'm going to get more of those. These are going back to the warehouse."
1,"Not Worth it, If it was free","The first trap was found with the front corner chewed - the second wouldn't set after ten minutes of trying to get the flimsy internal parts to set I pitched it - I'm done with this product, a waste. Has America lost our design capability, I looked for a Made in China stamp but found made in USA, Ugh. Avoid M130 - Surely the Victor brand can do better than this."
4,Divide and rule,"After the full throttle urban rock of Hot Water Music; the draft seems to stay at the sea side of a lonely town. Punk rock parking lots, bad decisions, aftermath, dance...all the feeling populated by a similary colourful cast of straight rock soul and albino paradise. Cut-class crafted of ""New eyes open"" to such sun-drenched change of ""Bordering"" you feel the mutating re heal of a new band/ashes of various nerve. However; some songs remaining out of place. The talent and the creative past of the band mambers built a conflict genre motives that fail to present a complete 'album'. There's the mature structure of ""Not what i wanna do"" and suprisingly low-class ""Lo zee rose"" (obviously choruses uplift the song) or insightful but sometimes confusing ""Impossible"". Elsewhere, there's the main ideas backed by the passion and paint-blistering rant. Witty deconstruction of an acute rock brain. Like 'take an endless breath. And rest."
3,Based on Live Gig,"Okay, so this is based on a live show. In Sydney at The Forum last night - 15th June 07.Now don't get me wrong, these guys were good live. The frontman knows what he's doing. But Jaysus H Christ, someone tell the guy on bass to go and take a long hard look at himself. His, status-quo schtick was pathetic and he obviously has phallic issues, the way he was sliding up and down the neck ofhis instrument. But what really lost these guys a star on the night was the way this wanker berated a couple of punters in the gig at different times for the most innocuous things. Listen mate, lighten up, you brought the whole experience down a notch or six. And if u can't lighten up, change professions.... for the band's sake!Against Me! were on the same bill that night and the way Tom & Co handled so much more that was thrown at them by the crowd and seemed to thrive on it, lifted the place as much as there ""leave nothing on the stage"" performance.Take notes, Draft-Bass dude!!"
2,"OK for chopping, grater doesn't work","I am about to replace this item. It chops ok but I also like to use my food processor for slicing and grating. Well, forget it with this one. The grating/slicing disk is too far away from the top so most of the items just get stuck between the top and the disk and never get sliced/grated. In addition, the bowl is really hard to put in place and remove - it only fits in one direction, and there are four possibilities which are hard to distinguish, and of course the correct one is always the last one I try. It also is hard to snap in place and unsnap. It is underpowered and noisy... well, I am tossing this one and getting another for sure."
5,love this!,"I have had several different food processors in the past, but this Black&Decker puts all of them to shame! It is easy to assemble the various components, the perfect size for me to use, and cleans up easily. I cook 90% of what I eat from scratch, and this little machine has made my life easier!"
5,A practical guide for teaching social skills,"This book is a practical guide for teaching the most essential skills in life: social skills. The book provides an extensive listing of 'tips' that one can use in applying these concepts to a social skills program or at home. One example: the authors recommend cutting out pictures from magazines that demonstrate specific emotions. In this way, the children can practice looking for these expressions and have the pictures as a reference throughout the program. Thank you for all of the great suggestions."
4,What came first,"Today this film suffers from not being associated with the times in which it was produced. Why did Cyd Charisse do that anti-Rock 'n' Roll number which today seems completely out of context? Does the film not emanate from the 'sane' world of the time giving its answer to The Girl Can't Help It which, incidentally, had a plot just as forgettable? The format is the same - guest appearances in cabarets by stars using their own name and, yes, don't miss the names in neon lights, Louis Prima, Keely Smith, the list goes on . It is all at once naive and fabulous, one of the voices in the wilderness against the intrusion of the decadent Rock. A collector's item!Simply cannot agree with the statement that all of the numbers in it were unknown, The Gal With The Yeller Shoes was a big hit and If You Can Dream featured at the time as well."
4,Meet Me In Las Vegas,"Meet Me In Las Vegas Remastered!..This is a superb movie and also a historic one, be it just for the cast.My only complaint is that if this was remastered I dread to think what the original video was like.May I suggest that Warner Bros. go back to the workshop and give this one the Blu-Ray treatment and remove all the picture defects, not that there are many, but some are disracting and there is a feeling it should be sharpened up, as the focus seems a little soft!"
2,Remastering a failure,"I have a VCR copy of Meet Me In Las Vegas (not remastered ) that is far superior in to the remastered CD. I enjoy the VCR because it permits me to see the most beautiful, talented Cyd Charisse perform as no other dancer can.I do not blame the poor quality of the present CD on my video equipment for I have eleven other CDs featuring Cyd Charisse and they all view beautifully.My remastered CD is gathering dust and will probably end up in the wastebasket.Fred C"
3,An MGM musical from an alternate universe,"This film contains all the marks of the big MGM musical -- lavish production numbers, lots of singing and dancing, and stars... Except the stars aren't exactly top flight. And you've never heard of any of the songs. And the musical numbers veer into the bizarre.There are two really unbelievable scenes. In one, the British music hall star Jerry Colonna kicks off a number called ""My Lucky Charms,"" and the showgirls have wacky costumes that could have been designed by the same person who designed the showgirl costumes in the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number in ""The Producers"" -- remember the pretzel and beer stein costumes? Like that. And then there's a ballet number in which two dozen dancers play volleyball. Yes, with a net and a ball -- en pointe.The story is forgettable, and so is the acting, but if you've got a few friends over and you're feeling giddy, pop this into the VCR and let the good times roll."
3,Ended up not using it,I think you have to use adapters for this thing. I never bothered figuring out how to use it so I threw it in the closet. Upgrading my wires to way bigger gauges anyways so it's obsolete for my install.
5,Laser Toner,The quality of printing is excellent. Time will tell as to how long this quality will last but so far so good!!!
1,Awful.....just awful,"I was excited with the fact that the item arrived so quickly. However, that excitement quickly turned to disappointment with the toners performance. Inconsistent printing blank lines scattered throughout the page. This item is absolutely terrible."
1,Cheap Toner Purchase Not Successful,"Garbage, wasted my money, prints too faint; I wouldn't recommend this product to others, someone is just refilling old toner cartridges with some cheap toner product"
2,"It's about a boatyard, but not about Joel White or the W-76","Douglas Whynott hung around the Brooklin Boat Yard for a year or so, and faithfully recorded the goings on. Much of the book is like a diary, however (today the garboard strakes were attached), and it does not really give insight into the people involved. Nor does it get very much into the gorgeous W-76, which it is purportedly about. For a good book on Joel White, which really shows his evolution as a designer and builder, splurge for Joel White: Boatbuilder/Designer/Sailor, written by two of his closest friends."
3,These are used with remnants of labels and data on some,These diskettes are not as pictured in Amazon. Some have data on them and some have remnants of labels that were torn off. No apparent connection to Office Depot and not in an Office Depot box.
4,"WE EAT WHAT """"""THEY PRODUCE"""""".","IT ITS INCREDIBLE THAT WE ALL ARE GOING TO DIE SOME DAY EATING ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT THIS BIGGGGGGGG COMPANIES ARE DISTRIBUTING TO US.THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO. THEY ARE TO BIG TO FIGHT WITH THEM. THEY OWN EVERYBODY. OUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT ALL THIS GENETIC CHANGES DON'T END UP CAUSING SOME KIND OF SICKNESS TO THE WHOLE WORLD; BECAUSE THEIR FOOD IS BEEN EATING BY THE WHOLE WORLD POPULATION.THE ONLY WAY IS TRYING TO EAT """"NON GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD"""" WHICH IS COSTLY AND SOME TIMES IMPOSSIBLY TO FIND.I WILL RECOMMEND OTHER FILMS LIKE """"BAD SEED"""", """"KING CORN """", """"BLUE GOLD""""(WORLD WATER WARS).GOOD LUCK EATING ALL THE """"GM"""" CORN."
4,Welcome back Mr. Peterson!,"If ""Civilization"" left you cold, then this one should do the trick.Chris Peterson is back, and thankfully so. Rhys Fulber has his place with Leeb, but for my money ""Flavour of the Weak"" and ""Implode"" cannot be beaten. ""Epitaph was a nice companion piece to those 2 discs, but ""Civilization"" was a real step backwards for a band who usually pushed electronic/industrial boundaries into new and uncharted territories. ""Artificial Soldier"" does a really nice job of putting Front Line back on track."
2,"It's OK....but it's no ""Implode""...","Front Line Assembly have released some of the greatest industrial masterpieces known to the genre. Instant classics like ""Millennium"", ""Hard Wired"", and the mighty ""Implode"" come to mind. But ever since ""Implode"", FLA has stagnated, releasing substandard albums that don't quite merit a purchase. Unfortunately, ""Artificial Soldier"" is such a release.Prior to ""Artificial Soldier"", there was ""Epitaph"" and ""Civilization"". ""Epitaph"" seemed like it could have been Disc-2 to ""Implode"". While a good album, it wasn't exciting enough to gardner many listens. ""Civilization"" was a boring and meandering release, that had maybe 3 good songs with the rest being filler. ""Artificial Soldier"" continues this trend.Do yourself a favor, and stick with the previously mentioned FLA albums. They are much better. Start with ""Implode"". That record will change your world. ""Artificial Soldier"" will just remind you how crappy the world is now."
3,Look nice...,"I ordered the pecan baskets to match my sons room and the white ones to match my dauthers room decor. I thought they looked nice and would be great for storage of many things. I thought they would come in very handy for laundry. With twins you do A LOT of laundry. The first 2 months i used them to store their gifts they were getting, toys, extra diapers,clothes, all misc items. After that i used them to store their blankets and i wanted to use them for laundry. But as i would take the blankets out of the basket there would be peices of wood stuck on the blanket?! I also noticed things would break off when iwould carry the baskets to the laundry room and back. At almost 6 months old my children are starting to find all those tiny things on the floor and put them in their mouths!! NOT GOOD! I have decided just to use them in their closets or places where they are not moved."
4,"Not Bad, Great Price","I bought these for both myself and friend. We were both very happy with them. True, these are not ""top of the line"" but what do you expect for the price. I've even purchased more, they're great for storage under the crib and changing table and fit perfectly in my closet system. No, these were not meant to be drug around carpeting by toddlers, but for storage, they're both capable and afordable."
4,Nice storage baskets,"I don't have little kids and I agree that these baskets could pose a hazard for little ones. I purchased these for storage and I love them and I'm about to order 3 more. I put magazines, small books and other family room nic nacs in it. It matches my cofee table and I store the baskets under the coffee table in my family room. It comes in really handy."
2,not too bad,"Wilson wasn't in the Marines so there seems to be a resultant lack of overblown USMC rhetoric, which is refreshing. He gives a tepid overview of the campaign, but admittedly this is very difficult to do. There could have been more focus on the US Army units involved, but what little he does provide is even-handed and not bogus unlike a couple of other books on Chosin. The title, though, regurgitates the old fable of ""Retreat, Hell! We're simply attacking in another direction"", which Marine General O.P. Smith admits he never uttered (He was much too understated and professional)."
4,Entertaining and gritty science fiction.,"I really enjoyed this book. It is a collection of several short stories, and one long story (the last story accounts for about 1/3 of the books pages).If you enjoy playing Necromunda, like movies such as Blade Runner and Dark City, then you will enjoy reading the tales this book has to offer."
2,"Another book of lists from Dummies, Inc.","This is basicly a book of lists--websites to visit, stuff to buy, etc. Aside from the fact that 90% of this information is available for free, a surpising amount is, well, just plain obvious. If you're not good at accounting, hire an accountant. You'll do more business if you accept credit cards. Good tips! Its also rather out of date and BTW, my copy had no CD.I note that the same author has written Internet Auctions For Dummies, another vexing subject. Now if I only had Returning Books To Amazon For Dummies....I did find a very good book which is just as basic but takes a logical, chronological, step-by-step approach, How To Start A Home Based Mail Order Business by Georganne Fiumara."
5,Starting An Online Business For Dummies,This book is truly incredible. I cannot even absorb all of the information in it! This is a MUST HAVE for ANYONE even thinking about starting an on line business. This is such an easy read and you can go on line and check out all the different web sites he has listed in the book. There is more information in this book than I ever thought possible. It is EXTREMELY helpful and written very well. It is the kind of book that you keep on your desk to constantly look up things. This is the best investment I have made in a long time. = )
3,Good summary of...,"what you need to get started, but not a great deal of detail. Also there was a lot of promotion for other people in the book, which I did not expect. The book makes it appear anyone can have a successful online business if they have the drive, but this is not realistic since there are many details that must be understood for a successful online business. My advise: Don't be overly optimistic because a stranger said you can be successful."
2,Wish It worked!,I never even read this book. If it would of worked just by me purchasing the book I would of been a happy girl. I hope who ever purchased it from my yard sale has better luck comprehending it!!
5,This Dimmer Rocks!,"My husband and I installed 4 of these dimmer switches in our house shortly after moving in. We used them to control the very bright sets of can lights in our kitchen, great room, and master suite. We couldn't be happier.The styling of the switches are modern, clean, and aesthetic. The LED button at the bottom turns the lights on and off with a simple push and the glider slides up and down easily - and produces a wonderful range in dimming the lights.The LED is red and not too bright, but VERY helpful if you happen to be searching for the light switch in the dark.In the 4 years we have had the dimmer switches, we literally replaced only 2 of the 18 or so lightbulbs that these dimmer switches control. This has been very helpful in saving money on lightbulbs and helping us set various ""moods"" in the house at different times of the day.I would buy these again in a heartbeat if the need arose."
3,Low budget but not toobad,"This was done in a short time and with a low budget but it is pretty good as a ""b"" horror film. I'm a little biased since my son was in it , I thought it was great that he's out there doing something I wanted to do, act, but was afraid to try.Oh his name is Noel Allison he played Joel."
3,Definitely a Fixer-Upper IN GORE !,"Stars: DJ Perry,Lana Wood,Johnny Dark and Terrence Knox.Wow,There is bits of THE SHINING,Hotel California and Home Makeover thrown thru-out this flick.What was that horror film with DIY tools- Driller Killer ? Nail Gun Massacre ? Tool Box Murders ? Home Improvement ?All of the guest stars really have moments,Which is wise use of film budget and DJ Perry has acting skills showing character development.Oh, Dear filmmakers this reviewer googled the HOTEL DEL SOL (where the murders happen and money was hidden),We found it in San Francisco ???"
3,Mathematical Methods for Undergraduates,Helps students become familiar with complex mathematics in more applications than a standard course. Not as thorough as the books covering the same material by Mary Boas. IMHO.
4,It's good - but no spell codes,"It was good but it did not have the one thing I was looking for. The spell codes with the ""c"" buttons."
3,It was okay but needed to give Merrick more credit,"Well I love anything that has to do with Joseph Merrick and this is actually the first book I found about him, but the authors seemed to be giving more attention to Sir Fredrick Treves than to Joseph himself, regarding him as a conquering hero and Merrick a pathetic freak.Ofcourse this just my opinion, and i'll give it 3stars for all the information it gives and the pictures that I truley needed to see."
5,"Never read it, but I know I'll like it- alot!","I have not yet read this book, but I defenatley will within the next month or so. Knowing I'll like it, I've given it 5 stars. Joseph (or more commonly known as John) Merrick's story is a sad yet fascinating one. Besodes Anne Frank, he is the most courageous person I have ever heard of. He was around 21 years old when he died. To think that someone could be as badly treated as he was! It wasn't Joseph's fault he turned up that way. In the movie, he was badly beaten by his master, and he got sick a few times in a row. Anthony Hopkin's character (he was the doctor who helped Merrick; I can't seem to remember his name at the moment) would come in visiting John Merrick only to find him wheezing badly. It's so hard just to try and imagine what life must have been for him, what he must have gone through. Hats off to Joseph! =-)"
4,radio alarm,it is a great clock. clear numbers. good radio. the only problem I have is that the on off button for the alarm is small and not easy to handle. but otherwise I am very happy with this product.
2,Can not be trusted,"I wanted this clock because of its compact size and red display. Most clocks have blue numbers which I find too bright so I was happy to find this clock with a red display. I received it as a Christmas gift, plugged it in and not even 24 hours later the power just went out on it. It has happened a couple more times since.It may just be this particular clock I have has something loose in it, but I can not recommend it because it can not be trusted to stay on. It is now in our guest room and I am still looking for a good alarm clock with a red display."
4,A really cool little clock.,"What we liked about this clock, (which BTW measures about 5"" in diameter):Not too big, fits on small nightstand without taking up the whole thing.Easily readable without glasses at night without being too bright.Great nature sounds to help you fall asleep.Attractive design.We haven't used the alarm extensively, but the buzzer appears to be loud enough without being obnoxious.And you can always wake to the nature sounds:-) Our radio reception isn't good, so we can't comment on the radio portion.If the power goes out, the time is saved by the backup battery, but not displayed. It's unclear if the alarm would actually go off with the power off."
1,bad buttons,"If you sometimes want to turn off your alarm in the middle of the night in the dark before it's set to go off, do not get this clock. The only way to turn off the alarm before it goes off is to move a tiny slider that's mid-way up the clock and move it only one stop; if you miss, you do the wrong thing or the alarm goes off. If you never want to turn off your alarm before it goes off, then the nature sounds are fun and the display is nice."
3,Compaired to others....,"Comparied to others these are the best I've found. Yet, unless you can find the right ones, they are thin and get caught very easily on velcro on the back of a choker or in a hunt cap. After geting caught on velcro, kiss them goodbye. With long hair, it will take 2 hair nets to hold it up, so buy an extra pack. They are better quality than the drugstore brand though. My current one was good for about 3-4 shows, better than the drugsote ones. and they have better color range."
4,keep your productivity if you migrate,"In the field of open source, there are only a few major relational databases - MySQL, Postgres and Firebird. MySQL has been garnering prominent wins recently, whereas Firebird has been steadily chugging along with relatively little publicity. But the book shows that if you are considering a free database, you should seriously look at Firebird. The book describes a very highly fleshed out database, that supports much standard SQL querying. Plus Firebird has had stored procedures and foreign keys for some time. The book goes into detail on these. Whereas MySQL has only its latest version incorporating them. Not as mature as Firebird's.The core of the book is its Part 5, with several chapters talking about Firebird's SQL variant. The good news is that you should recognise much of it already. Much of your previous SQL experience should carry over to Firebird. Preserves your productivity if you migrate."
5,Clear and Authoritative,"I've been running Interbase and Firebird servers since 1997, and within the first hour of reading The Firebird Book, I learned at least ten new things about Firebird!The writing is clear and concise, and the topics selected are practical and pertinent to any user looking to use Firebird. Any level of Firebird user will gain something from this book."
5,Christmas Gift purchase,Bought this for my daughter's boyfriend for Christmas. He's a drummer and went home and watched it that night. LOL He loves it!
3,Music better than the movie,"Unlike the above reviewers, I didn't like the American movie at all. The original movie was about a behavior seen as deviant by the Japanese mainstream, and this essential motivating essence could not make the translation. Gere and J-Lo, as much as I love them both in their appropriate contexts (Hollywood pulp), can't match the original Japanese cast for acting talent and depth. However, this soundtrack is very fun. I recommend the CD for dancers (of any ability), Latin-Spanish music fans, obviously fans of the movie, and people who like to work out at the gym to ""happy,"" catchy music on a CD that varies tempo a little bit. The Pussycat Dolls version of ""Sway,"" maybe the best number of the set."
4,Nice CD,"If you loved the movie then you should buy this CD. My favorite is ""The Book of Love"" song. Some of the tracks are just music tones but it is still a very enjoyable CD."
3,wedding song,"It was a little more mellow than I anticipated. I really wanted the song from Peter Gabriel. It was planned to be the first song my husband and I would dance to at our wedding. The band never heard of it, so i just listen to it on my way to work."
5,SHALL WE DANCE,It's a great fun loving dance CD. I have a passion for dance not only was the sound track good but the movie was as well. I recommend you buy both the sound track and the movie.
1,"Horrible, no good, very bad, crap","This entire cd has one good song that isn't available anywhere else, legally, The Book of Love sung by Peter Gabriel is fantastic. All the others are like nails on a chalk board, it makes my soul sad."
1,Direct All Praise To The TRUE Author,"I am only commenting on this album to make one thing clear: The Book of Love was NOT written by Peter Gabriel (a myth which is so far being perpetuated due to the ignorance of the fools praising Mr. Gabriel's performance). It was written by STEPHIN MERRITT; more specifically, it can be found on Merritt's band, The Magnetic Fields' album, 69 Love Songs, Volume 1. Why Peter Gabriel gets so much credit for turning a beautiful song into a somniferous cacophony is beyond me."
5,MYA RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The ONLY reason to buy this cd is for Mya's rendition of David Bowie's hit, ""Let's Dance""!!!!!!! As you can see they saved the BEST SONG for last. As usual Mya's treatment of a song is impressive, in other words she peed on this one!!!!I gave it 5 stars for THAT reason and THAT reason ONLY!!!!"
4,happy feet,"If you left the movie barely able to control the urge to dance, this soundtrack is for you. If the movie did not make you want to dance, stop right here -- I don't even want you reading my review! If you haven't seen the movie yet, rent the original Japanese version on video first. It will allow you to appreciate a quality remake, very faithful to the original but with small changes that make it very significantly American. Then buy the soundtrack and a single red rose for your sweetheart...and dance him or her to the end of time."
5,One of my favorite CD's!,I keep this upbeat music in my CD player at all times and listen to it every weekend! If you love dance movies you will love this CD!
3,Superb Music - Mediocre recording,"Superb music, disappointing sound quality (if you are an audiofile!)coming from a company of that calibre. Price not justified."
3,"Incorrect album cover and ""editorial review"" shown!","Except for Journey to the Twin Planet, I enjoy this album, but haven't listened to my vinyl copy in years. Zoot Suite is an odd number that I found disconcerting the first time I played the album, but it grows on you, and sometimes you just have to hear it. Coltrane's Central Park West and India form a contemplative counterpoint to DeJohnette's own compositions which seem to have been composed with David Murray's style in mind, but Murray's ""emotive"" sax is an acquired taste that is distracting to listen to while reading or working (which is probably why I have only 2 Murray CDs and 19 Stan Getz CDs). For me it's really a three tune album, but one I want on CD as I replace my ECM vinyls with CDs.My comments are really to point out that the cover illustration and ""editorial review"" are incorrect for this album -- someone at Amazon should should correct this error. The music samples are correct for this ECM album."
5,Perfect decor,"In order to avoid creating holes in the wall of a new building, I purchased this for my office to hold a clock. It was super inexpensive, super cute, and super functional. Love it!"
3,Not my favorite Corsten remixes,"Yes, Corsten is a wonderful live DJ. If you can find a copy of his _Live at Amsterdam RAI_, snatch it with both hands. And yes, his side projects (System F, Gouryella, etc.) are fun, easy-to-listen-to pop trance. I like 'em. And I worship his remixes of William Orbit's _Pieces in a modern style_. There, Corsten turned some pretentious Orbit failures into towering anthems. But these remixes didn't do it for me. The source material just seemed like boring, predictable thin house. Give me his later works, not his early works."
3,so so,"I don't think this book is bad, but it's not very good.There are several nude photos of stars inside, but not many. No matter naked or dressed, the photos inside this book make me feel just so so. I cannot see characters (even feelings and thoughts). Compared to what Kash and George Platt Lynes did on portraits I have to say this books of Gorman's work is not a very good one."
1,Brown lines and bad customer service,"I have the same brown lines problem, but with a 793MB syncmaster. I put up with it for a while, then called customer service. They said they would ship a new monitor, and pick up the old one for free. Well the shipping to me was free, although the return was not. I called customer service with the name and extension of the person that had told me the return was free, and the supervisor did not budge. To top it off, the brand new montitor has WORSE brown lines than the old one. I have to hit the monitor very hard to get them to stop.All and all, b/c of the TERRIBLE customer service, I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING SAMSUNG AGAIN. These companies need to realize that it is more worth it for them to suck up $20 in shipping rather than lose a customer for life."
1,Samsung Headache,"Well I got this one for my boyfriend, and the brown lines showed up the second day. I took it to the repair/warranty place and they at first claimed to fix it, but as soon as I got it home, the brown lines came back. Back to the repair shop, where they claimed to replace it, but it had the same serial number as the original model.So I called Samsung and got a brand new one in the mail in a *very* battered box. The styrofoam was even crumbled to bits. This model was from China, not the Philippines. The brown lines are *worse* this time and I am about to contact them again to try to get another trade-in.As a side note, a friend of mine had the same experience, but Samsung gave him a trade-up to an MB model. He hooked it up in a dual-monitor setup and found that the colour is horribly amber tinted, so he's going to return that one, too.As another side note, I purchased the black and silver 793DF model and have had no problems at all yet."
2,"Sharp, crisp images but defect disappoints.","The images are sharp, crisp and of great quality. A pity that, like a number of other Samsung moniters, brown lines started to appear on the moniter over time. No amount of testing, software or hardware, could fix it. Finally, I discovered that it was a manufacturing defect. Presently, I'm deciding whether to exchange it or just get an LCD."
1,I have the brown line problem!!,"I have only had the monitor for about 4 or 5 months and now i get the brown lines on the right side of the screen, not good for a 200 dollar monitor, stay far away from this defective equipment!"
2,only if you are under 13,"yes, the cover is very pretty, the lettering looks ""antique"" and it will look cute on your altar in case you invite someone over but this has to be the most stupid collection of spells ever printed. even the ""author"" (if the little girl who came up with these can be call an ""author"") admits in the introduction that these spells are just for fun. buy it only if you have some money to waste. if you're serious about the craft look somewhere else."
1,I'm a little confused,"Ok first of all no matter what magick you practice you sure ... should know that do unto others as you would have them do unto you goes for everything. I really think this book was cute but very brainless.This was a gift that they requested thats the only reason I would consider getting this.the spells probably work,if you put enough time and effort into anything you can make any spell be effective,I've been a magus and practicing magick for many years now and feel that this book should be a silly read through book and definately not taken seriously. Remember when you do spells like this your going against someones will to gain what you want,thats very wrong.if you don't think so thats great but you'll find out the hard way:) And it harm none!do not upset the balance of nature."
1,Cute yet not for the serious,"I bought this booking thinking it would be something that it was not. I read it and got a laugh out of it but that was merely it. One of the spells is unite email lovers, uh right. I do not recommend it for those in search of something other than entertainment."
3,naval ops commander,than you for the product when i contacted you that monday it come so thank mr disipio any more games i whould recomend people buy from you mr. disipio
1,This game stinks,"I also purchased this game after playing Warship Gunner, a game I found to be immensely entertaining. The first problem I had with the game is that the color doesn't seem to work - I'm playing in black and white! Second, and more important, the game play is terrible. The bird's-eye perspective is so confusing that it makes it so that you have no idea what is going on. Just awful."
1,Poor Quality,It shrinks and wrinkles. Over priced and poor quality if you ask me. The coordinating wicker baskets are also very over priced if you ask me.
2,not as great as i remember,"I really liked this product when i was about 12. Years later, i've been looking for it in stores, finally just looked for it online. I was really excited to use it again, however it really doesn't work as great as i remebered. It actually makes your hair pretty sticky/crunchy like heavy hairspray(i didn't even use much) and it does not smell good at all. I guess there's a reason they discontinued it."
1,Unacceptable binding--falls apart quickly,"The dictionary in itself is very good for a concise dictionary.The problem is with the binding. After about one month of usage, the thing started losing pages and had to be thrown out.This is UNACCEPTABLE."
3,I expected a little more from it.,"-book is a little below my expectances, but still attend my needs; -english-portuguese section a little poor in the contends: i thought it would be richer with 80000 entries."
3,At quick glance.....,Mr. Titus did a good job. I'm not finished yet. This would be great for kids who want to play gospel music. I learned about the sharp and flat.
2,Written for the Money?,"For me, this wasn't a well-written book. For a start, Shapiro, at the time of writing this book, hadn't mastered the English verb. Regularly throughout the book, his use of verb tenses is bad enough to be confusing. Where was his editor? Secondly, it's shot through with his unsubstantiated or unexplained personal opinions - about George's spiritual practice, his personality, and his substance-taking. He didn't leave me assured that his opinons could be relied on as being well-researched."
3,Average,"Well written book, but not a complete bio. Latter part of Georges life glossed over. Mainly about Beatles and immediate post-Beatles life."
4,Mostly well built.,Sturdy good looking cabinet. Don't look too hard inside (or the back). I threw out the poorly NC hacked back panel and threw in the trash. The white fluffy edges of the fiberboard (painted black) looked bad. Made my own panels with real oak.
5,Sad but touching,Beautifully written. Would recommend it over and over again. A must read for any and every one! This one absolutely tears at the heart strings!
5,i loved it!!!!,"I read these books when i was in 8th grade! i hated to read and these books i couldnt put down!!!! im sad to say i never got to read the last book because the school year ended and my high school doesnt have them, ill find it sooner or later, or i might have to buy them. I would recommend these books to ANYONE they were AMAZING!! i hope you guys enjoy them as much as i have!!!!!"
5,Inspireing,At first Dawn is scared Of corse Who wouldn't be but she learns to deal And is willing to help others just like her.she made some good friends like Sandy and Marleen. One of the sadest parts is when sandy her best friend turns Ill. Its hard to explainthe hole book But It was verry hard for me to put downit only took me one day to read all in all i own 1/2 of Lurlene McDaniels books and i am tryeing to get the harder to find ones win i m finished i will own every book of hers she has written Verry good Books Verry good Books Verry good Books Verry good Books Verry good Books
2,Dawn Rochelle:Four Novels by Lurlene Mcaniel,"I really loved this series. Lurlene Mcdaniel really has a gift to allow her readers to feel what the characters are going through. Dawn Rochelle is a very strong girl and has gone throgh so much. I enjoyed reading about her romances, and cried as I read the pain she went through. I have read the first four books about Dawn and can't wait to read the last book. I highly recommend this book."
4,AMAZING!!!!,wow! i couldn't put the book down. i've read one and i read the books within half of a school day. even though i'm not going through what she's going through...cancer wise...i can relate to what she was saying. i burst into tears. i'm so touched by the relationship with her brother and her. i could just see everything. i loved it! i can't wait to read some more. i've heard great stuff about this author and everyone's been right so far. thanks.
3,Munch's Review,"The CD on a whole was good, I purchased the CD for one song (Porcupine by Nature Zone)but overall the CD was good."
4,Tank,The antenna to tank legth is short about 15 feet at the most. I have had it for about 3 weeks no major problems.
3,Good,"Although it's a little early to tell, so far so good as far as holding up is concerned. Only complaint I have is that the Tank I recesived is not like the one pictured in the add. The one shown and that I ordered was s different color. Desert tan. The one I receiced was cammo. I already had a cammo colored one. However, it was not worh the effort to complain."
5,Great RC Tank for the price,"The following review is from my son who is 11 years old.It has been a GREAT toy ever since I got it.The on-board cannon works great.However, the battery does not last 1 hour. It only lasted about 30 min, and then after a few months it didn't hold as much power.Also, one track keeps coming off in the grass when I make turns.It does not include all the decals like on the real tank, either.Even with these flaws I recommend getting it because I think this is just 1 tank out of 100 that has something wrong with it."
2,broke,"I was really excited about getting this for my grandson, I even made sure they all had safety glasses because it was SUPPOSED to shoot plastic bb's, and ordered extra bb's along with a loader. That was all a waste of money. The tank ran fine and was fun with the exception of the gun, it would not shoot the first bb. My grandson was very disappointed, how do you explain that you have to send a toy back that Santa was supposed to have given to them. I should know better to order anything online, and from out of town that has moving parts. I won't be doing that again. Needless to say that was his big gift and it was mostly a flop."
1,It came broken,The tank arived early but however it didn't work. All it did was just move forward. The channels was set correctly and it wasn't in program mode. The instruction booklet did warn me if the tank was defective I should send it back. Can't give a good reveiw on a defective merchandise. The company that sent it to me was good and the tank arive quickly though. I sent the tank back so hopefully when I get a working one I can give a better review.
4,Wasn't sure at 1st but cool now.,My parents bought my son a very expensive tank last year that has all kinds of gadgets on it and real treads for the tank. He wanted another one for his birthday and bought this one. I liked this one because it held its own against the big expensive tank. It was a lot faster than the big one so the American tank kicked the Nazi tank's butt. LOL
5,basketball sneaker,I bought this sneaker for my daughter. She picked it out on line. She was eerie on the color. But the members on her team loved the color.And I also thought the price was good.
2,Some information not grounded in reality,"This book does an excellent job of describing things from the perspective of the standards, but does not always acurately articulate reality. There are many things in the specifications that are not yet implemented, and are likely to be dropped or re-worked in the future before they appear as features in real handsets, WTA in particular. No device manufacturer has implemented, nor has plans to implement WTA features which this book states ""can almost be guaranteed to work and behave consistently across current and future networks and across a wide range of mobile clients"""
1,Good book about useless technologie,"Hi, fellows ! The book is really easy to read, i agree with previous reader. And who still thinks, that this is a good technologie, i will recommend it. There are practical all things, what you need to develop a WAP solution.But, what about is this book ? About WAP - technological useless solution for wide marketing actions. Dear fellows, WAP is out, and there is no back for this technologie. Just wait a little bit the new UMTS system and we will se, what technologie will bring with itself.If you think in your enterprice about this solution - forget it. And finaly don't buy this one, you can cabbage some money for beer or another book."
1,Would not RECOMMEND this vaccum.,"We have had this vacuum little over a year, never been really happy with it. This duster doesnt work, which was a selling feature for me, it just spreads it around or sends it in the air to resettle. I hate the filter in the canister, it is so hard to clean out, unless you wash it and then you have to wait for it to dry. It clogs alot and the stupid belt to spin the brushes has come off so many times I lost count. Just very frustrating, it was a cheaper vacuum but I hate that I already have to buy another one. Guess I will spend more this time and hope to get a better vacuum. I wouldnt recommend this vacuum, look somewhere else."
2,One-year warranty is good for the company,"After the first week I owned this vacuum, the problems started adding up. First, the belt kept slipping off, and two belts broke within the first month. Then, the bearing on the brush roller gave out, not once, but twice. Spent close to 100 extra dollars fixing this vacuum when it broke, and now it's totally useless and the warranty has run out. Avoid buying this vacuum if you don't want a lot of extra expense and frustration!!"
1,"The vacuum from hell, sucks because it doesn't suck!","Have only owned this vacuum for one month. It completely quit working, wouldn't even turn on. Took it back and received an identical replacement. Dirt doesn't go into the cup, constantly have to unclog it, throws sand around instead of picking it up.Waste of money, buyer beware! Wanted to go for NO stars, but one was the lowest possible choice."
2,less than one year,This vacuum was clogged every other time I went to use it. Now it will not work at all. It's been only 8 months and I need to buy another vacuum...
3,Works good for the Price,"Vacuum works well for the price paid. It does not have as much pickup strength as the last vacuum I owned, but is also $150 cheaper than my last one."
1,Stops working after 6 months,"This vacuum really sucks. After six months it no longer has suction, even after unclogging it. It completely stop working. Took it back and got full refund. Buyers, beware, no need to go through the headache."
5,Great resource for finding your way,"This book was completely amazing. Fun to read, extremely informative, lots of information about not only beginning nursing school but getting through until the end! Lots of great quotes, tons of resources (some chapters have a couple dozen helpful websites listed!)and information I use every day.Not only the most helpful book I've read about nursing school, but also the best career guide in general I've seen!I can't say enough about this book!"
3,disappointed,I bought this book wanting to find out a little more about nursing school before I started. I don't think it gave me any info I didn't already know except for the websites. That part of the book was good. I think this book would do a good job at scaring away individuals who are thinking about going to nursing school because it is somewhat negative in the fact that it says alot about being overworked as a nurse and stressed out constantly. I guess it's better to be honest about the profession than to sugar coat it.
2,Disappointed.,"Im 26 years old. I start nursing school in one month. I ordered this a few weeks ago, and i forced myself to read it, ONLY because i paid nearly [...] for it.I think this book would have been great ten years ago, when i was in high school contemplating becoming a nurse.But by now i pretty much know the basic information she gives (in high school i was clueless).This book is more her corny opinions with a few quotes here and there from supposed actual students.I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking oh just shuuuuuuuuuuut upppp. as i was reading it. is that mean? well, im just being honest.i told u i was only reading it cuz i paid for it, and i just didnt like it.i read the reviews here and hoped this book wouldve helped me, and i tried to ignore the negative comments. and now im one of them.dont waste your money, but if you are buying it for a young kid in high school, it mite be ok."
4,Helpful,"I really enjoyed this book, It was helpful in telling you more about what to expect and how to deal with some of the things that happen in nursing school."
2,Required Reading for LVN Class,"Received book on time for my LVN course. In great condition. Read book, has some useful info. But, I feel most of the book is relating for RN students."
3,Rare collectable,"Almost no articulation, but that's common for the Kenner line at the time. It's a rare figure, that was hard to find in stores even when they were being made. Luckily enough toy collectors assumed that they would be more valuable than they turned out to be, so you can still find these online for a reasonable price."
4,A Very Good Start For Eliminating Self Sabotage,"I Really like this book. As a professional motivational speaker, who is trained and experienced in many motivational disciplines, I find this book touches on some very key things that one needs to master in order to be a success. The part I found particularly relevant was the part on Career Acrophobia. This section really touches on why many people just don't get ahead. It explains the Glass Ceiling and Self Sabotage phenomena very well.The only reason this book doesn't get a 5 star rating, is that it's a little weak on how to effectively address, the emotional issues it talks about. There are far more effective ways of addressing these issues, but this book does give you a good start.I'd recommend it.In Everything Truth, Faith and LoveDestin"
3,Good Psychology Business Book,"This book is hard to read, physcially and mentally. The font is rather small and you would think they were trying to save the rainforest in their converesation of white space. They should have focused more on editing. There were times the material just went on and one and you would find your mind wandering on to the more exciting root canel work in the morning. Now, that is not to say that the material wasn't without nuggets of value. There were plenty of them. I was able to releate to at least 8 of the habits at one point of another of my life and could see all 12 in people around me. I was also impressed that they said that you will never truely get rid of these habits, you just have to work at keeping them at bay. I wouldn't recommend this for a casual vacation read, but one if you want to look deeply into your self and try and understand why your career hasn't necessarily taken off."
5,Fantastic book for any professional who wants to succeed,"I have enjoyed this book and I came to know my bad habits in my professional and personal lives. It also gives the methods to go about in changing bad habits. Actually I have read their previous book, ""Discovering your career in business"", twice ( 1997 and 2000). Both books have helped me in knowing myself and how to go about changing my bad professional behaviour. I am buying Maximum Success book for both of my children who are professional but they are still young."
5,WOW! Share the insight,"This book is for everyone who works with others -- not just folks who work in big business. I recognized myself in so many of the chapters: having to hit home-runs, fear of failure, seeing the world in black and white --as well as the people I work with. This book provided a deeper understanding of my strengths and weaknesses as well as strategies for change. But it also gave me a greater appreciation and understanding of those I manage and work with. All in all, an informative, lively book with many useful applications."
5,This is the one book to read...,"For managers and becoming a manager, this book is great! First it gives the general description of the stereotypical people types on the job. You will find yourself in one these. And the great thing about identifying your type is it will offer the solution for your improvement. I highly recommend this for all levels of employees (not just the managers but making a better work environment too for both corporate and non-corporate). This was really well written book!"
3,Useful warnings could be presented more engagingly,"The authors are authoritative on identifying major psychological issues that harm one's career. In Part I, they explain the personality types that hold people back from success. This was a little scary because anybody should be able to see some of themselves in most of these types. Part II is more interesting because it covers the underlying reasons for the self-defeating behaviors in Part I.Rather than repeat a summary of the book, I would just caution the reader on the experience of reading it. To say this is dry is an understatement. It is just not engaging and on top of that, each personality flaw is a separate lecture. I could not get through this book cover to cover, and I'm the stubborn type that persists normally. The book has a lot of good information. It is not the type of book to read through as much as a reference book in my view."
2,A hard read!,"Although this book has many gems hidden inside. It was hard to read. Slow moving, boring at times, could be half the length and would be more enjoyable."
2,The 12 bad habits,The book gives a lot of descriptions of bad habits. The value of possibilities to solve or handle the habits is low.
5,Even more than already been said,"This book gives you the behavior and pattern of the self sabotaje in a very simple way. I found my self or least part of me in some of the examples,even in a very quick instants in my life. As human beings we make a lot of mistakes in an unconscious state and we're just simple not aware of it. To make you concius there are brief storys to explain the roots of the bad habit. This guys could really make a good contribution to your professional an personal life for a few bucks."
1,IN SEARCH OF MEDIOCRITY. Or How I Learned To Pucker Up.,"These knuckleheads define 'failure' as honesty, integrity, candor, having standards, and 'swinging for the fence' in terms of striving for excellence. All of this turns people off and intimidates them. It's true, I see it everyday in the work world.But H.L.Mencken was generations ahead of them when he observed, in the 1920s, that real success in the work world only requires gross incompetence & the treachery of a snake."
5,Gateway 2 CD Purchased at AMAZON Excellent!!!!,"Gateway 2: Featuring John Abercrombie: guitar,mandolin, Dave Holland:Bass,Jack Dejohnette:drums,piano. What a fantastic CD.These gentlemen have been a major force in the modern music world.Their list of credits is rather extensive, from Charles Lloyd,Miles Davis,Billy Cobham,the Brecker brothers etc.In this studio session the fellas are working from a more extemporized setting,instead of their usual outings that find them exploring each others compositions,this CD appears to be mostly focused on ""free playing"" or open ended concepts,rather than planned out compositions. Beautiful,engaging,thought provoking. If you are new to the 'magic' that is the ""Gateway Trio"" you might prefer their first CD,simply titled""Gateway"".If you are an adventure minded music lover check these gentlemen out. You will not be sorry.I give this CD 5 stars.It is another great session from these master improvisors."
1,Junk,"Got this pulley for a motor I was using on a lathe. Put it on the motor and fired up the lathe only to have the vibration create chatter on the workpiece. After some serious checking, and about 30 minutes of run time, the belt began to show heavy wear. The casting on this pulley is so poor that the seam between the tow halves has sharp edges that eat up the belt. Additionally I noticed about a 1/16 of an inch wobble. Thought it was my motor shaft. Took the pulley off and put in on a different motor with the same results. The pulley is not even close to being true. This is a total piece of junk! The casting says Made in the USA, but it runs like cheap Chinese garbage. Don't waste your money, buy something better."
5,MARY HIGGINS CLARK NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME!,"EVERY TIME I READ ONE OF CLARK'S BOOKS, I THINK THAT I HAVE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HER FORMULA. BUT...EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE STUMPS ME. I HAVE READ EACH OF HER NOVELS, AND I CAN NEVER FIGURE OUT THE ENDING. SHE IS TRULY THE MASTER OF SUSPENSE. LOVES MUSIC, LOVES TO DANCE IS MY FAVORITE THRILLER. THE PREMISE IS BASED UPON DATING VIA THE PERSONALS. MARY HIGGINS CLARK TAKES REAL LIFE SCENARIOS AND PEOPLE AND BRINGS FASCINATION AND INTRIGUE TO ANY CIRCUMSTANCE."
3,While My Pretty One Sleeps,"I really enjoyed this book.I especially liked the ending. It was a great storie of mystery,horror,murder, and love. I would recamend this book to eny one who likes mysteries, and murders. I also really like the auther she is a great wrighter."
5,great,"I bought this because I needed a big hook for my dorm room. The first year, I used it to hang my headphones near my desk. My Grados have a large headband, and the hook was still able to accommodate those, so that should give you an idea of how large the hook is. This year, I'm using it to hang my shower towel, and it works really well for this. A wet towel can be quite heavy, and it's held the weight with no problems!"
3,OK,"Works well, holds my coat. Be careful to get it on straight! It comes with an extra adhesive strip if you screw it up."
1,3m command strips,i have always loved command strips use them for everything and everywhere so i thought i would step it up in size for more of the bigger things i have i ordered 5 boxes of the strips so i got 20 strips and 4 hooks all togeather out of all the strips 1 yes i said 1 has worked its says max 7lbs well let me tell you i put it on a 5oz speaker to just hold it on the wall so it would not slide off of my stand and it will not even hold that im very upset and will not order them again.
3,Towel hook not much else,"The hook was not what I thought it would be. The hook was too large for the items I wanted to hang on it. This was not evident in the picture or description of the hook. The installation was perfect, but I will not get my moneys work out of the hooks. Great if you want to hang towels."
3,great for a while...,"I really like these but they do break with too much weight or too much use over time. I know they are not drilled into a wall and are made of plastic, but certainly, they can be made better, no?"
4,Who the hell is burried in Jimmy's Grave?,"I was recently introduced to this music at work, and was immediatle taken by Watongo and his severed heads, crazy African drums, and Macombo. Swahili Bob and his bisexual puppet show are also intertaining. But by far the most twisted and disturbingly funny song on the cd is the Return of Patches and the clown mafia. An all around funny, dark and slightly disturbing album. Thanks Mike."
3,Couple of hits and oh so smooth 70s music,Doobie's are in the groove with slow and smooth 70s sounds that take you back to mellow days...McDonald's voice brings back good memories.
5,Love the Doobies,"What's to say. If you love the Doobies you'll love Minute by Minute. My original copy has been misplaced so for the the money, I just bought another copy. It's brand new, arrived within a couple of days after ordering and is exactly what I wanted. What else is there to say?"
3,What Was All The Hoopla About,"I wondered what all the hoopla was about. It was about two songs, two songs that made this one of the biggest commercial successes, that this band ever had. This was the biggest album these guys ever had. It is so obvious why it did so well, ""minute by minute"" and ""what a fool believes. That's about it in a nut shell. You can love Michael or hate him. This album as a whole wasn't that good. ""One Step Closer""(there next album) kills ""minute"", didn't out sell it. Two songs like those don't come around everyday The thing about these ""Doobie Brothers"", you gotta like Michael McDonald, Me.....I loved him."
3,Most Over-rated,"Although not a bad album at all this is in no way the Doobie's best. At this writing there are 12 Doobies studio albums and I would rank this one about 9th best. Even in the Michael McDonald era it is not as good as ""Takin' it to the Streets"" or ""Livin' on the Fault Line"". The title track ""Minute by Minute"" is a great song and one of Michael McDonald's best, but then the album also contains the embarassing poppy ""What a Fool Believes"" that I wish was not a Doobie Brothers song. The other contributions by McDonald are quite forgettable (""Here to Love You"" is OK). Contributions by ""Real Doobie"" Patrick Simmons, ""Don't Stop to Watch the Wheels"", ""Steamer Lane Breakdown"", and the hit ""Dependin' on You"". Help sustain the album and make it not a total waste. Curiously when the Doobies finished this album they were not pleased with it and were ready to break up right then, then it started selling so they stuck together."
2,Running out of steam...,"I'm a little surprised by all the positive reviews here. I've been listening to all of the Doobie Brothers excellent older releases and this one sounds so watered down in comparison. Another reviewer said they were ready to break up after completing this album, and you can see why. Although ""What a Fool Believes"" is a masterpiece, nothing else here comes close. McDonald's songs on Takin' It To The Streets and Livin' On The Fault Line were so much more inspired (see There's A Light, Losin' End, Nothin' But A Heartache) and the collaborations sounded so much more inspired. He sounds bored here, as does everyone else. The drums sound so flat and what little guitars there are, too restrained. It's ""Doobies Lite,"" the aural equivalent of Light Beer. So sad..."
1,"If you like older doobies, stay away","There are only four doobie's cd's worth anything. Toulouse St., Captain&Me, Vices & Habits and Stampede. I don't know what happened to the doobies after these cd's but in my opinion it wasn't good. I could enjoy all cuts from all of the above. Each one is a musical masterpiece, demonstrating the musical expertise of the whole band. There is nothing in this cd that even resembles the quality of the above. If that's the doobies you like, don't waste you time on this."
3,Strictly Michael McDonald,"I wouldn't recommend this. I bought this to get ""some"" Michael McDonald Doobies stuff but was disappointed when I realized this is 100% McDonald. Although he did some good things with the Doobies, I was a big fan of the original Doobs and absolutely can't stand so much of Michael McDonalds syrupy vocals in one sitting."
5,i like the inside cover of the minute by minute record,"DOOBIE Brothers are funky but yet still classic rock, soothing, melodic, everything you would expect from stoners that know how to play good music."
1,Emasculated Doobies,"Here, Michael McDonald continues the emasculation of the Doobie Brothers. Apart from What a Fool Believes (and possibly the instrumental Steamer Lane Breakdown, which sounds like the Marshall Tucker Band), there's precious little here. Hard to believe this is the same group that recorded Toulouse Street, The Captain and Me, and What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits."
4,Greatest guitar solo?,"McDonald is very much in focus here so you have to like him to like this album. But take a closer ""look"" at the last track ""How do the fools survive"". After 3 minutes of McDonald vocals, old-time Doobie, Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter, takes over and treats us with an amazing 2 minutes guitar solo, said to be improvised during the take. To me this is as close to guitar heaven as you can get...."
5,Wow!,"Must'a been 1975, tent camping on the valley floor of Yosemite. The wonderful riffs of music came rolling across through the camp ground from an r.v. It was the Doobie Bros. We discovered them then, and it's been great traveling and relaxing music ever since, bringing back great memories with class music & lyrics."
5,Yay! More over the barline studies...,"Rudimental drum solos are very fun at first, especially when you're doing great sight reading them. But it can get very boring.This is NOT the case with this book!! These solos have many of the rudiments being played over the barline and starting on other weird rhythmic positions. I just got this book last week, and even though I read through it the first day, I am now going back and focusing on 2 solos at a time. (i want to be able to play these really well!)Great book... very fun... and despite constant recommendations to get Pratt's 14 Modern Contest Solos, I feel I should've had it in my library months ago :)"
4,Just what I expected,"Book is in fine condition. Solo's are an interesting addition to my hands work. I do a lot of lifetime warmup and things like that, but these solo pieces are intended to open up more conversational ideas with my hands. They seem to be at the right level of difficulty to give me just what I need."
4,a good compilation,As a jazz fan with limited resources I got this cd to expand and learn about newer jazz. The compilation is not all recorded at the jazz festival but rather recordings that stand for what the festival is about. It has a great range of jazz and is good for hearing different artists.
4,Fascinating and funny!,"I'm reading this book in one sitting and I'm almost at the end. I just can't put it down. It's honest, brutal but also very humorous! Definitely recommended!!"
3,Questionable stability at maximum height,"I'm using the FlowTron SP-200 Security Lantern Pole to hold my FlowTron-40 bug zapper. It was a little difficult to get the first piece 2 feet into my backyard soil because its mostly clay after about 1 foot. After connecting all of the pole pieces and the FlowTron-40, I found the lantern pole to be somewhat unstable. I removed one of the pieces so that it stands at about 6-7 feet and it works just fine."
3,It's aight,Had this for a week now........does the job. Holes for the bolt were off by a whole lot......not sure if that's the way it's supposed to be. The rubber stopper that goes at the end was toooooo small. The thing kinda spins around with the wind......I have it in the ground per instructions but since it is put together in sections....the sucker spins. I am too lazy to look for anything else so I will keep it. I does its job......but was too expensive. It should have been 15 bucks. BTW... I use it with the smallest Flowtron.
1,Waste of money.,You are better off buying a plant hanger and using it. That's what I ended up using. This item is cheap and unstable not for use with the heavy bug zappers. What a waste of my money. Don't waste yours.
3,Flowtron SP-200 Security Lantern Pole,"This review is for the Flowtron SP-200 Security Lantern Pole for Electronic Bug Killers.Amazon shipping with Prime continues to be great! Package arrived on time and adequately secured. The pole itself seems fairly adequate and more than heavy enough to handle the job. The sections fit together snugly.With regard to the lock feature, the j-bolt is either too small or the holes they drilled are too large as there is a lot of play in the assembly. Finally, the nut that they sent to fasten the j-bolt to the arm was too large--was not compatible with the bolt. I ended up going to Ace Hardware to buy a beefier stainless ring and lock nut which is what they should have provided in the first place. But then what can you expect for forty bucks? Be prepared to provide your own fastener.R. Laurent"
5,"Fun, Free Impressionistic Jazz with a hint of Yoga!","This CD makes for a great mood. Candlelights, burning incence, perhaps even massage oil! Ok. for the first couple of tracks anyway. For the rest of the tracks and even the whole CD, I'd suggest: Cooking something exotic (to go with all the funny instruments), be loose and eat the food sitting on cushions in the living room with some friends. Last, but not least, try to see the humour in the music. I love it!"
2,Not that good. Salvageable at best.,"Her voice and musical arrangements are as top notch as ever, but as far as the songs are concerned, they are at best, forgettable. They should have put at least as much effort on the songs as they did on the cover of the album. Bought it on Amazon, and sold it back on Amazon. The prices I see for a used copy are too high considering you can get her earlier CDs for much less and get much more satisfaction."
3,"This must be a ""Return of the King"" game.. :)","I came across this while looking for something else, and curious as to how you mix a backgammon game with ""Lord of the Rings"", I checked it out. This must be a ""Return of the King"" game, because if you check out the description provided, it says:""Customized record-shaped checkers featuring 24 Platinum and Gold Elvis records turn the classic Checkers game into a walk down memory lane.The customized game board features images of The King throughout his career.Elvis Presley Collectors Edition Checkers is packaged in a collectible keepsake tin.""Not at all what I expected, but very funny, nonetheless. :)Since it wouldn't let me post this without rating everything, I gave it 5 stars for fun, because it sure was funny, 1 star for educational value, because Elvis ""The King"" has nothing to do with ""Lord of the Rings"" and this is thus very misleading, and middle-of-the-road for durability and overall because I've not actually played it."
4,Not as bad as all that!!,"I received this game for Christmas and while I agree that the ring colors are difficult to distinguish, the construction of the box and board do not seem as bad as the other reviewers let on. I'm not so sure how one could dent a board playing backgammon anyway... that'd have to be some pretty violent backgammon."
5,Colors best CD,"This is Eberhard Weber's band Colors' best CD. Yes they're all good, but none have the fire and consistency of this one.It has none of the lapses into minimalist monotony that occasionally flaw Yellow Fields, the band's first outing.Only three tunes and the band stretches here, but because of the excellent writing and inspired soloing this one is never boring. Charlie Mariano is particularly compelling. His solos are a model of great modal playing and really deserve study by aspiring soprano players. This is how it's done. Great ensemble playing. This is one of Weber's all time best."
5,It's True -- Weber's Best,"This fantastic record is certainly the most focused band performance in Weber's admirable discography, with supremely beautiful compositions, and career-peak contributions from Rainer Bruninghaus, Charlie Mariano, and John Marshall. Bruninghaus' solo piano intro to ""Seriously Deep"" is one of the most haunting pieces of music I know."
4,Unique Pleasure,"If you liked Yellow Fields, you'll like this one more. Eberhard entered into his peak period with this project. Each of his compositions are like facinating journeys taking you to various different places. Rainier Bruninghaus was playing more acoustic piano in this album than he did in the earlier albums by Weber and it really revealed what a wonderful pianist he was at that time. His electric piano work was always good too, but had a tendency to get lost in the other sounds. Here it really showcased his artistry quite well. Charlie Mariano wails throughout the album and John Marshall (known from Soft Machine) was excellent as well."
2,Biased.,"Reading this book was very torturous in some ways. Naomi Wolf presents extremely biased viewpoints based on one-sided facts. She completely disregards the role the other sciences (biology, etc) play in beauty with only a few paragraphs. I suggest taking her statistics and facts with a large grain of salt. She tends to focus on the superficial parts of a research that fits her support then disregard the general conclusions.This book, however, does address real issues that we face today. I recommend doing your own research and reading other books to provide a more well-rounded prespective. Survival of the Prettiest, The masculine mystique, etc"
1,"muddy, unoriginal, and unreadable","For the life of me, I can't figure out why this book ever took off. I've tried to read it twice now and still cannot slog through the bad writing, lack of logical structure, and Ms. Wolf's seeming inability to successfully support any argument. Considering that most of her arguments are extremely shopworn, that's a pretty sad comment. We all know all this stuff anyway--the media gives us impossible images to live up to, beauty carries too much weight in our society, anorexia and bulimia are on the rise. Skip this one and try her other books instead--like Promiscuities and Fire with Fire. Did she learn to write, or find an excellent editor for those ones? Whichever, at least they're real and original books, not a mishmash of random thoughts."
2,An Angry Tone Prevails,"Frankly, this book ranks well below the author's other works I have read. In fact, I never did finish this work, as the angry tone of the writing turned me off. Since this was an earlier work, it is clear that the author has matured and has a better grasp of her emotional responses to complex issues facing women in her subsequent works. Naomi Wolf is a valuable social commentator, and while this book certainly makes some valid observations, it is not up to her later standards."
2,The book distinguishes real vs. ideal.,"The Beauty Myth is an extrodianrily rare book. It focuses on how images of beauty are used against women by examining the figment all women measure themselves, and eachother, against - the Iron Maiden. The author, Naomi Wolf connects women's feelings of inferiority to the evidence they are dominated in religion, culture, and the workplace. Images of beauty in advertising and pornography contribute to the rise in cosmetic surgery and our society's obsession with thinness and perfection. The book attempts to illustrate how women are divided, as competetors for the scarce beauty there is that is recognized. Wolf presents a few great points and lots of supporting evidence. She lacks an interesting writing style, however, and hashes out the same point 200 pages too long. The Beauty Myth would make a moving essay, but as a book, beats a dead horse."
4,interesting and well researched,"I'm not an expert in feminist literature and don't have any strong opinions on the subject. I found this to be a very interesting read, though quite a bit of it bordered on the unpleasant and the disturbing--rape, violence, surgical violation of the body. It also treads the line between the scholarly and the general interest book, although it's probably much closer to the latter. Very well written, it felt a bit tragic, poetic, philosophical, and almost Freudian in style. A general criticism: could it be that some women seek to beautify themselves, even in an extreme manner, somewhat independent of modern societal, or patriarchical, influences? An evolutionary biologist might argue that some if not most women might have an emphasis on beauty that is hardwired into their brains, and we are simply observing a manifestation of that inherent nature in the modern environment. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."
4,Essential reading,"This book altered my whole perception of beauty as it is presented culturally and socially. I just wish I had read it when I was an impressionable teenager. Furthermore, I wish that everyone who claims that feminists have nothing left to fight for would read this book. Wolf's well written and thought provoking take on Western society's obsession with beauty clearly proves that we unfortunately have a long way to go until men and women are truly equal.Warning! This book may cause a great deal of rage and a sense of hopelessness. Don't be discouraged by all the depressing statistics that Ms Wolf presents - make a wow to yourself and all the other women out there to refuse to silently accept to be objectified and lessened. That, and not the latest miracle cream from L'Oreal, is what we are truly worth."
2,The evidense for authers assumption are real myth,"The Beuaty Myth has very little substance to it. The author appears to be just letting out all her anger agianst the world. She maks many wery broad and damning accusations however she does not back any of these accusations up with any evidence. Also, she says the same thing over and over throughout the book. Mrs.Wolf beleives that there is a conspiracy of sorts agianst all women. This conspiracy has led to the stall that has occurred in the feminest movement. She beleives that corporations and men of the world are trying to make women bekeive that they are not pretty or that if they are that they are stupid. by doing this they are insuring that society will continue to be make dominated and that corportions will be able to continue to make a great deal of money from women. Mrs. Wolf does little to supprt this the reader is just expected to beleive it. Well I for one did not."
2,serious disappointment,"i was very glad to get my hands on this book, but quick to put it down in disgust. while i know, i have experienced, what she it trying to say, i can't get past her manner of presentation, and the fact that she has information in the book that is simply *incorrect.* for example, when she discusses the cult of beauty and fat-hate, she mentions how hare krishnas spend seven hours daily in mind numbing chant. well, as a hare krishna myself, i can state that this is irrefutably false. way to go, naomi."
1,"Poorly written, flawed arguments, very outdated.","I understand if this book was groundbreaking and controversial when it was first published in 1990, and I respect it for bringing these issues to a forefront and empowering women during a particularly tough time, but the book does not age well.In general, Wolf's arguments and justifications are extremely flawed, and her deductions are illogical. From a modern feminist perspective, she makes statements and generalizations about men and women (even as she tries to debunk other generalizations and myths) that aren't exactly progressive or feminist.This book does not hold up to the test of time, and even then it has serious flaws."
3,good - but hard to read,"This book is for the feminist. It makes you quite mad at society, and sometimes hard to read with her drabble. But she is an inpsiring writer and her words penetrate through you. It makes you want to be a feminist! I liked the book, highlighted a lot, but probably would not read again. It was long and sometimes hard to focus. She talks about how the media and the culture is against women - and is quite true!"
4,An interesting read,"Naomi Wolf has written a passionate, involved book, that analyses the 'Beauty Myth' from a perspective that is first a woman's, and second a sociologist. While parts of this book are a bit extreme and political, on the whole it provides a new framework for thought, and many fascinating angles to consider in any discussion of beauty, culture or women's media.It is ironic that some of the criticism this book has received in these reviews ('Let her be ugly, or even average before she writes a book' , 'the way she throws her beautiful hair around') only goes to prove much of what Ms Wolf says - that her views as an author and a human being must be so inseperable from her looks, and that there is some quality of 'ugliness' that is absolute and which women should constantly strive to get out of.Feeling attractive is certainly every woman's right, but it is a feeling, not an absolute state. Anyone who has travelled out of America, and experienced diverse cultures, will testify to this."
3,Great.,"Great. Now, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie will be coauthoring a book called ""The Work Myth"" describing what an utter waste of time our national preoccupation with resume' writing, pouring over want ads, professional preparation and vocational education, networking and the like are, while in other venues, mocking those who are not wearing the latest designer labels and owning the latest expensive toys."
1,And how about men ?,"There is as many pression on men to be attractive. ""how victimisation about beauty is used against men"" would be a better title for this book."
1,"Sentence by sentence, the stupidest book I've ever read","Naomi Wolf was a lovely young slip of a girl when she wrote this remarkably brainless book. The only reason people paid attention to this idiotic book was because Naomi was young and hot-looking. It drove Camille Paglia insane that Naomi was being treated like she knew anything about life. Naomi has done a lot of growing up since then, and I imagine she must be pretty humiliated that people are still reading this deeply awful book."
1,Misunderstanding of anorexia and bulimia,"Given recent research that indicates that anorexia and other eating disorders are the result of obsessive-compulsive disorder, there is no reason to condemn fashion magazines or the ad industry as ""causing"" this disease. Wolf's attempt to explain this disorder through looking at the media surrounding women is no doubt well-intentioned but simply incorrect."
1,Out of Date,Do not get this book if you are a forward thinking woman. This book is old and does not apply to anything that is current. Save your money. My book club decided not to finish this book because we all felt the same way.
3,a thought provoking read,This is a good book for anyone who has ever felt the pressures of society telling you how to look. The book will make you angry and it will also make you think. I would recommend it.
2,"Well intentioned and intriguing, but deeply flawed","I was deeply disappointed in this book. While it was obviously well-intentioned (and brought up challenging and intriguing ideas), it was so ill written that I could hardly bring myself to finish it. Wolf overgeneralized to such a degree that I couldn't take her seriously. Though the central idea is interesting, I had a hard time finding it at first. The writing was disappointing -- full of illogical leaps and implied causality. (I have to wonder if Wolf has ever taken a critical writing course. It would certainly be of use to her.) To be honest, this book looked like a very promising first rough draft that accidentally made it into print. In my opinion, this book could have used some serious editing and re-writing before it ever saw print. I would reccommend this book only on the condition that one reads for concepts (which Wolf has in abundance) and not for proof or argumentation (which this book utterly lacks)."
4,Must Read For Feminists,"From the affluent, white female perspective, but still very relevant. Wolf explains how women adopt a third shift to take care of their beauty. It keeps our minds occupied and our pocketbooks empty so we don't start a revolution. I consider it a must read for feminists and pro-feminists."
5,changed my life,it was translated to hebrew lately.i just finished reading it now.i'm so glad i read it. its full of amazing ideas. important to weman of all ages.what can i say? read it.
2,Guess stainless steel watch,I ordered this watch but returned it because it was cheap looking. I didn't care for it at all. It looks better in the picture!
5,Very Nice!,Every woman who see this watch wants to have it! I bought it for a gift and the woman who received left impressed. It's beautiful!
5,woooooooooooooow elegant watch,oh my god... it is an elegant watch... I like itit is very beautiful..when I wore it.. every one asked me about...I am a princess with itdo not hesitate.. buy it as quickly as possible
4,Techno tunes,"I have looked everywhere for some type of techo dance aerobic music. From the recordings I listened to, I think this would be appropriate for an aerobic dance or kickboxing class. It is a little fast (bpm ?) and may need to be slowed down a bit for low impact or step class."
3,Amusing,The Brunei football team and their coaches deserved more credit than what Mr Park wrote in FIFA 192. The people of Brunei showed him hospitality unparalleled anywhere in the world. Amusing read anyhow...
5,"Truly Stanley's ""Magnum Opus""","Read and learn. This is Football's answer to Anthony Burgess' ""Devil of State - also banned in Brunei.Passion, corruption, hypocracy they are all here in capital letters.Anyone who has ever lived in South East Asia will love it!So will anyone who has never lived in South East Asia and who has a sense for truth being stranger (and funnier) than fiction."
4,Fantasy Football Personified,"Peter Reid once said 'Only the best players can play without time and space'. Well Stan truly created time and space to become a 'utility' player, in his unique, humourous and informative tale about real-life as a die-hard footballing expatriate. The events take place in the late- 90's boom-time of the tiny Bruneian Sultanate, when anyone could be bought and nearly everyone, including Newcastle and Chelsea, but not our Stan's Liverpool, were. A true story of football, romance and revenge, this tale appeals to both football nuts and anyone who has lived or worked overseas."
1,Badly designed product,"This trap is nearly impossible to set, either on sensitive setting or on firm setting. After about 20 times, it finally set and then went off as I walked away. I visited the youtube channel the company provides as instruction and that's a joke too. The bottom line is this design is a disaster and I can't believe they are still selling them."
1,Don't waste your money!,"These traps are completely useless. I bought a bunch of these, and they won't trip. The mice just strip the bait right off, and don't trip the trap. I have held these traps in the set position above waist high, and dropped them on the floor, and they still don't trip! In fact, they bounce and land upside down on the trap mechanism AND STILL DON'T TRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can push the yellow pedal down flat against the wood base, and it still stays set! These traps just are NO GOOD. I need to find the good old fashioned kind without this yellow plastic piece of cheese."
1,Snaps your Finger not the Mouse,"These are not very good. The trigger is plastic and pretty hard to set. I'd set the trap then try to place it down as gently as possible but it would keep triggering. The plastic trigger was too slipery or something.If you do happen to get it set, you still need to put some bait on the trap. The plastic cheeze looking trigger is not meant to fool the mouse (like some people seem to think).Place them along a wall - mice seem to like to walk along a wall or edge of something. So I just place them anywhere they might usually walk and whammo.If you can find the old style with the metal trigger, get those. Way better, cheaper, and easier to set - however you can't find them in retail stores anymore for some reason."
1,They didn't create a better mousetrap!,"This product is awful, awful, awful. The mice don't fall for the fake cheese bait. Even if they did, I almost lost several fingers trying to set these things. Doesn't really matter, though, because it would catch the same amount even if they weren't set -- zero.I found some of the older version, those that actually take bait. Smeared with peanut butter and voila! dead mouse the next morning! The problem is the retailers only carry the new version or some expensive traps or reusable ones -- yuck!"
1,Horrible Design,"I've always been a huge fan of Victor traps, but this is one of the worst designed products that I have ever seen. I simply believed I had bought a set of traps that had some flaws that would be unique to this one package. Who would've believed that this was no accident. Don't waste your money on this ""Easy Set"" trap. It's not so easy."
1,Complete garbage. Should be taken off the market!,"It amazes me that anything like this ridiculously designed mouse trap could ever make it to the market. Designing a mouse trap is not rocket science and apparently the ""engineers"" at Victor are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Do not waste your money on this piece of crap mouse trap. This company deserves to go out of business for putting such a bad product on the market. These traps are impossible to set and a complete waste of time. I will throw these away and try to find another solution. I have a good idea for VICTOR, close your doors and go out of business, take your products off the market and do everyone a favor. I want my money back!"
2,Save Your Dramamine,"On this live compilation, Conor Oberst manages to suck the life out of almost every song -- his own, and the cover tracks. Instead of delivering frenetic, upbeat, and loose versions of the songs, Oberst sputters out slow, controlled renditions with bare-bones instrumental backing. On his studio tracks, Oberst's lyrical delivery is natural and fluid; even his clamorous outbursts seem unplanned. On this disc, Oberst sounds like he's reading the words from his liner notes -- matching them exactly, but lacking true feeling.On the final track, Oberst disgraces the late Elliott Smith with a dismally dry cover of Smith's ""The Biggest Lie."" The only high point on this disc is the previous track, a whimsical and enjoyable version of the campy Lua B-side ""True Blue.""Steer clear of ""Motion Sickness"" and pick up the studio tracks on ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning"" instead."
2,Not up to par,"I purchased this CD after seeing Bright Eyes in concert, and Oh, what a mistake. The concert was the best I've ever seen, and I stupidly thought to recapture the amazing performance despite the CD's the so-so reviews. Unfortunately this CD reflects Neither Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst's live Nor recorded talent. It's passionless, and that's the last word I would ever think to use to describe Obert's work. Passion has always been Oberst's driving creative force, and there is no point to Bright Eyes without it.All this being said, I do not do not discourage the purchase of ANY OTHER Bright Eyes release. Conor Oberst is a phenomenal artist and his work is among my all-time favorites.Who knew a mediocre Bright Eyes Cd even existed? I still am marvelling..."
4,Lots of Trumpet,"Motion Sickness, Bright Eyes' third album of 2005, is a compilation of live versions of some of his greatest hits. Many of the songs feature trumpet quite prominently, this working to great effect in ""We Are Nowhere And It's Now"", ""Southern State"", and ""Old Soul Song."" The album also contains his provocatively political and sacreligious single, ""When the President Talks to God"" as well as a less-whimsically performed and less enjoyable version of the song ""True Blue"". All in all, the album is a generally good mix of songs (also present is ""The Biggest Lie"" by Elliot Smith) with a distinct flavour."
4,lawn sweeper,"Works very well on level ground. and same level of grass . does need adjustedfor my type of yard but does a good job on leaves , cannot set low enough for nuts and acorns but otherwise good product"
4,"good, not great","The brushes sweep leaves forward where they are then deflected to the catcher. I found that the gap between the lawn and the deflector was to large and a significant amount of leaves would get swept ahead of the sweeper and not into the catcher. I added a piece of plastic to extend about 2 1/2 inches lower. Problem solved. With my addition it does a great job of picking up even the smallest leaves. Ground must be flat. Does not work well on uneven ground, misses a lot."
4,Part of a Solution to Go Green,"I purchased this product in conjunction with a manual, push-type reel mower with the intent of using it to clear debris (small sticks and leaves) from the lawn that a power mower would normally suck-up. The unit is relatively light, but stiff enough to work in relatively deep (2 to 3 inch) grass and on some sloping ground. I would not catagorize the unit as robust, but it has proved adequate in service. The attribute I like most about the unit is that it has wide working width, so it only takes a few minutes to run over the lawn pre-or-post cut. The attribute that I like least is the plastic construction of many of the parts, but, it has held up so far. This unit is working for me and I have not run the power mower yet this season. I guess another good reason to purchase the unit is... no power-motor noise!!! Just the pleasant whirring sound of some brushes!"
4,leaf sweeper,"This product actually worked better than I had expected! I would have given it 5 stars except it doesn't do a good job on the cement surfaces. However, it does a great job on the lawn. I was really impressed."
3,Target has it cheaper,"I have not yet purchased this item, but am investigating cost. In most cases, Amazon is the least expensive way to go. In this case, Target online has the item less expensively ($149.99) also with free shipping. It does pay to shop around."
2,So-so purchase,"Pros:Assembly fairly easyWorks acceptably well with correct height adjustment for terrainEasier than rakingCons:Nuts supplied for assembly did not match bolts - they wouldn't screw on, necessitating an extra trip to the hardware storeLocal home improvement store had competing model with heavier gauge metal frame for 50% less - Price too high for quality of sweeperJust feels cheap - I wouldn't bet on longevity, especially with heavy useBag relatively small - needs to be emptied frequentlyHeight adjustment has to be changed whenever lawn terrain changes"
4,Much Easier Than Raking!,"We use the lawn sweeper every week to keep up with the falling leaves. It really does a super job! It picks up about 90% of the leaves with minimal effort. It took me a little getting used to pushing the sweeper. You kind of have to push it in an upright position rather than head on like a lawn mower. Once I figured this out, it was much easier to push and picks up great once you find the right level to set it on. I tend to dump it while the bag is attached while my husband finds it easier to remove the bag and dump it that way. All in all, I think it's a great product that does what it says it will. I highly recommend it. We have the cleanest lawn on the block because we sweep every week rather than wait to rake a ton."
3,disappointed,"I thought the lawn sweeper would be great, but for my yard it wasn't.I have sod/zoysia grass, it did not do as well as I had hoped. My neighborhas a different grass and it worked very well. I would recommend thislawn sweeper for large open areas not quarter acre or half acre lots.I would like to re-sale this item if anyone is interested."
3,Lawn sweeper,One set of the brushes is already falling out of the sweeper. I hope that this is not a regular occurence.
1,WHEELS JAMMED WHEN NEW,"After spending an hour assembling this item (because the tolerances on the lock nuts are too tight for easy assembly) I discovered that the wheels didn't freewheel in reverse and jammed at the end of every run. This is a problem with the main unit, which is assembled at the factory. The manual says to re-align the pins inside the ratchet gears. Not sure it's worth the extra time, or if that will do it. Would prefer a refund."
1,Its not worth $100.00,"The bag is a real cheap plastic woven bag.The stitches fell out after the first use. The sweeper itself works as long as you are on level ground. I will never ever buy a AGRI-Fab Product agin. To cheaply made, They fall apart after first use. I am 47 years old and live in Kettle Falls WA."
3,parts missing from package,"I bought this to use on my synthetic turf/putting green. It does a decent job of picking up most everything when the hight is adjusted correctly, even small twigs. Hight adjustment is easy. It does not do a good job near borders and fences, leaving a six inch section that needs to be hand raked.The package arrived missing three bolts, fastener and nuts. I called the 800 number and got them shipped with no problem, but after all the comments on here regarding missing materials you would think the company would put pressure on the chinese manufacturer."
3,Agri-Fab is okay,"I found that I was able to pickup about 75-80% of the leaves on my lawn, but had to use to blower for the rest.The biggest problem was that the hopper, while big, was low in the front, so it never filled up. Because of that, I had to empty it often, which was annoying."
3,You asked for a review,"Agri-Fab 26-Inch Push Lawn Sweeper #45-0218I was mostly satisfied with this product but I made 2 changes.1. I didn't like the way those bent pipe supports dragged especially scoring the driveway when I went over it so I added sets of double small wheels.2. There was too much space between the brush supports and the axle which caused pine straw to wrap around the axle making it impossible to push.I added 3x3"" plates on both brushes to solve this problem.Everything is fine now."
3,"prompt service, OK product","Got my sweeper quickly but I don't think it was really worth the price. I put it together easily and not real heavy, went out to try it. It did pick up the leaves but I had to go over and over the same area to get the leaves up. I could have just mowed and gotten better results. Worked on the small area beside the driveway lots better that the higher thicker grass in the front yard. Maybe I wanted too much from this product. Will still use it but more often and before too many leaves."
1,Review of lawn sweeper,"I purchased the lawn sweeper primarily to clean up a putting green beneath a pine tree over a very well manacured lawn.Our grass is very short (putting green) and with the low setting on the lawn sweeper unfortunately it will fling the pine needles and debre out in front instead of in the basket, so it does not work very well for what we got it for.For taller grass it works better.R. Riehn"
3,Could not assemble,Eight nuts included with the sweeper were the wrong size. I purchased the correct size and have used it for about one hour. It will pick-up acorns if adjusted close to the ground. This requires cutting the grass short and holding the handle up high to prevent shooting the acorns ahead of the sweeper. 9/29/07
3,Push Lawn Sweeper,Sweeper looks well built and sturdy. It compares to others I have seen in stores.I haven't used it yet because of the snow...
1,"26"" Agri-Fab Push Lawn Sweeper not worth it","I bought this as a Father's Day present for my Dad and was a little insulted 6 weeks later when he went and bought a bigger, pull behind his mower, sweeper. THEN I went over to his house and tried them both out. The 26"" push Lawn Sweeper from Agri-Fab throws more of the yard debris back out onto the ground than it picks up. It was horrible. I would have been better off to just give him nothing. It was a complete waste of my money."
4,Good product which works above average,This lawn sweeper overall is a good product. It will pickup 80-85% of fallen leaves off concrete or grass.PROS: -Reasonable price-Lightweight-Will work on multiple surfacesCONS: -Feels flimsy at times-No on the fly height adjustment
3,Missing parts.,"Bought this sweeper a few weeks ago and when I went to assemble it it was missing half a dozen parts in the parts bag. After calling the company and explaining the issue the parts arrived within a week. The sweeper over all is very nice, if you don't have a ton of leaves on the ground. The bag is pretty small and it doesn't sling the leaves back very far so you allways have to stop and either unload with half a bag or push the leaves back to continue."
4,Works well,I would recommend this trimmer. It works very well and is fairly quiet. I would like it to have different sized guides or blades though.
5,Lots of practical uses for these!,"We love these! We use them to clip ""pee pads"" to the bottom of the walls to keep the cats' pee from rolling down onto the carpet. Not pretty, but it works!"
4,I love 3M products,"I bought this to hang up my calendar against the wall. It works great. I even clip additional things against the calendar such as notes, etc.."
4,Works well for small items,"I bought these clips to hold dishwashing gloves on the under-sink cabinet door. They work well for that, but the hinge doesn't open very wide, so you couldn't use them for anything very thick. That being said, the clip is strong, so i don't worry about anything slipping out. I just wish they would hold larger items as well."
4,Webcam,This item is very easy to use and give a pretty good picture. Works well with older laptop and a newer PC. Our system is Windows 7 and works well for us.
5,Demonata #2: The Demon Thief,"After reading the first book in Shan's Demonata series I could not wait till the next book was released. I was not disappointed when the book came out. The second book seems to take place some time preceding the first book as one of the characters from the first book is ""in training."" However, according to the sneak peek of the third book the first narroator comes back to continue his story. The second book does have some gore and sickening discriptions; the narrator even vomits at one point but turns this into an advantace (I'll let you see how for yourself). Overall a very intersting read. Can't wait for the next book."
1,Not very satisfied,It says it works on Inkjet printers but I couldn't print my pictures and it got my printer very dirty it prints regular paper with black lines.
4,"This film captures the ambience of Kyiv, Ukraine","Having lived in Kyiv, and knowing it's people, I must say this film captures the city in all it's many moods. Despite the fact that the Kyivites speak Russian throughout the scenes, this is a very Ukrainian movie."
5,An story of life and values or lack of in current russia.,"I rented this video an was impressed with the quality of the writing and character development.An educated young man finds himself out of sync with the current society in Russia and the effects the change to a totally money oriented society has made to his life. He has difficulty finding work, his wife leaves him and his life seems at an end. Events change in a very unusual way brought on by his desperation."
5,Wonderful Addition to our Kitchen,"All of the pieces that were needed to assemble this piece arrived in perfect condition. It took me and my husband about 2 hours to complete the task, even with making 2 mistakes. Some patience was required, having to jostle and pry parts to fit. It does require two people to do this.The piece is sturdy and well made. The stainless top adds to the look and really works in our kitchen, complimenting the stainless appliances. The storage area is more and ample.Well worth the money."
4,"Well-written, bet you won't guess the ending","Having recently discovered Mr. Hassler, I am happily making my way through all his works. This book has been my least favorite of the four I have read, but it is very enjoyable and well-written. I just didn't warm to some of the characters as much as in Mr. Hassler's other novels. But all the characters are well-drawn, the story never gets boring, and the ending was certainly a suprise. I like the way he writes and think he deserves to be much more widely known."
5,1940s Small Town Life,"I first read this novel some years ago after ""Staggerford"" and it made me a true-blue Hassler fan. Its rich cast of characters keeps this novel moving along. Though a few of the characters are merely great window-dressing (for example, I wanted to see more done with grandfather), most are fully developed and integral to the plot. Overall, the theme of redemption through action is clear, and, sadly, many negative elements of small town life haven't changed in the 21st century.""Staggerford (also by Hassler),"" ""Grand Opening"", and ""Passing through Paradise"" by John Schreiber make a great trio of Minnesota novels. All are highly recommended."
4,Ingenious,"I'm an anthropology student and found this book for some light reading. It's pretty insightful. I'm also Hispanic and found myself reflected on quite a few senerios/""code words"". A great guide for those who want a glimpse into a diverse and enigmatic world."
5,Mexico Lloyd says Thumbs up on this one.,"This book is almost a bible. My friends and I who have traveled and worked extensively in Mexico found this book to be very entertaining. I have given away copies to new arrivals and have developed a list of topics not covered in the book, which should be included in future editions. Reading this book along with a good history book and perhaps ""Aztec"" would be a good foundation for your Mexico experience."
4,Mexico - what you didn't know,"From the moment I opened the book, I was completely engrossed in the subject - Mexican culture. It helps the norte-Americano to understand how and why Mexican culture differs from ours. It all makes sense, now."
3,It's a useful guide,"This book contains many important insights to the Mexican Culture, but have found it to be innacurate in characterizing the entire country as a whole. There are some inconsistancies from region to region."
1,Silly and Biased,"I recently purchased this book with the idea that it would hopefully provide an introduction to aspects of Mexican culture. Unfortunately, it seems to me to be a re-hash of usual stereotypes about Mexico and Mexicans, perhaps written from a more high-brow level than usual, but no more illuminating for all that.It is true that writing about another culture in an attempt to ""explain"" it is perennially popular as well as politically suspect in some circles. Personally, I do believe that it is possible to write a book about another culture that can be illuminating, but this book probably says more about gringos and their lack of perspective than it does about Mexico. If you must read a book about Mexico written by a norteamericano, try Carl Franz' ""People's Guide to Mexico."" When you get past the hippie falderal it is an extremely good book and the only one that ever taught me anything about Mexico that I found useful on the ground there."
2,Advertising,"While Ms. Burton did give little snippets of information on a wide range of things to avoid for health benifits. This small (63 pages) book basically was an advertisement for her cookbook ""The Candida Control Cookbook"". I found many references within this book to her cookbook. When I finished reading, I was left with many more questions than I had answered. Look elsewhere for your information."
3,Warning to listeners...,"As of today (6/29/09), the tracks posted here by Amazon are actually the tracks from Randy McStine's ""Guitarizm"" CD, and the Sky High tracks that SHOULD be here are posted on the McStine page."
3,Fact Filled Documentary,"This 60 minute video is jam packed with fact after fact. It is perfect for people who are studying anything relating to the Jewish Temple. The movie is interesting, but can be a little slow at times. Still, this movie is good for those interested in learning more about the temple's history, and the rebuilding of the new temple."
1,Very bad quality!!! Don't buy.,Sigma watch has a very poor quality. I bought I PC7 one year ago and the first time I put it under the shower it stops working (it was supposed to be 3m water resistance). I sent to sigma and I have to pay for all transport expenses from (From China to Brazil).After 1 years the battery is down and the back is rusty (I have a 10 year old Casio watch that is used is swimming in pool and seawater and does not have any rusty).Don't recommend Sigma watches.
3,Simple cast pulley. Wish I had gone with machined steel.,"Not bad, runs true on the shaft, but it's just a plain old, simple, die cast aluminum pulley. I have no reason to believe these will ever cause me a problem, but I would have preferred machined steel pulleys."
3,Not Enough Map For Money,"I like this software overall and some of NatGeo's maps. I would have given it 5 stars if NatGeo had not been so tight with the map data. You get all of Maryland beyond Baltimore 3.5 hours West of Baltimore (almost 200 miles!)but once over the Bay Bridge (about 40 miles) there is little of the Eastern Shore beyond the actual shoreline. There are a lot of fantastic Parks and great Rivers just a bit further East and still in Maryland but NatGeo didn't want to give up the extra quads to include these areas since they also include Delaware. Shame on you NatGeo! Cheap and greedy of you. I would have gladly paid a few extra bucks to have the MD's Eastern Shore and the Delaware Shore included with the DC/Balto region. Also, the maps are pretty old--1970's. I'd like to see NatGeo put a little more effort into this one."
2,High pitched noise...,"I am having the same problem as the earlier reviewer. Intermittent high pitched noise from this monitor.The monitor is stylish, decent picture, but unless you are deaf or enjoy returning this noise making monitor for warranty repair you might want to consider another manufacturer.It is ashame that Samsung hasn't fixed this issue... Haven't run into a similar problem since back in 1995 with a CTX monitor. You would think companies would learn by now...B rating for display, A for style and footprint and F for noise.Unfortunately the noise is really annoying and the until didn't make any for the first 2 1/2 months."
2,dot pitch value is misleading,"They give you the dot pitch in horizontal measurements, not diagonal. This monitor might be fine for playing first person shooters, but for any sort of graphic design work, it's useless. There's bad moire on both sides, and any fine text looks very grainy. I tried two of them, thinking I may have just gotten a bad one, but no. I have a 17"" flatscreen compaq running at 1200x1024 and the text looks at least 3 times better. This monitor maybe worth 170 bucks, but not to me. I'm returning it. The color is pretty great, the size (as small a footprint as a 17"") is also nice, but I can't hack the text resolution."
2,Noise Unbearable,"As reported by some others, my monitor also delivers the same unbearable high pitched noise intermittently. Too bad because an otherwise great monitor for your money."
1,Not worth wasting your money on...,"I would not waste my time reading Dean Graziosi's book. I would also warn anyone who wants to sign up for his coaching program, PMI/Dean Graziosi Real estate success academy, that it is a scam and they will NOT refund your money. The course is redundant and a waste of money. There are too many great sites online for people interested in real estate investing and it's free! Dean's students only get their money back by misguiding you, beware. Google Dean Graziosi scams, there are thousands of complaints. Buyers Beware! The Attorney General in Utah and Arizona are aware of Dean's Enterprises and the many different names his companies are under. I have been burned out of $12,740 that they refused to refund me after 2 weeks. Turns out, many people have similar stories. Dean Graziosi is a scam artist and a crook."
3,Good but note this flaw,"I've made some bread from this book very successfully, but the gingery bread has a mistake in the amount of water. I had it on the timer and woke up to find a lump of dry junk. It needs 1 cup instead of 2/3 cup water. If you look at the proportions, this is obvious. The Paremesan tomatoe bread was great, though."
3,many easy great-tasting recipes made with ordinary ingred,"This book is so reasonably priced for the wealth of great recipes it contains. I rank a good recipe book based on how many recipes in it are actually feasible for the average person to make simply and without having to search for rare ingredients, this one definitely fits the bill!"
3,Good (for the most part) recipes,"All the recipies I have tried have worked with the exception of one: the Ranch Dressing Bread. It was horrible. But the Pepperoni Pizza Bread is great, one of my favorites.Also beware of the Harvest Vegetable bread - the hard dried vegetable chunks took the non-stick coating off the bread paddle."
5,Pleased with cookbook,"Cookbook arrived in time promised. It was in better condition than described, I was very delighted about that. Good price too.I would trust this seller with my next purchase."
4,"analytical, insightful and entertaining","This is an excellent psychological, socio-historical overview and analysis of the behind-the-scenes casting and creation of many famous and not-so-famous sitcoms, that is not overly academic in style, but is in-depth in analysis, i.e., this book is for all levels of comprehension. An added bonus is the funny commentary and musings that the author adds (Bill Bixby is a ""low-rent Alan Alda"" etc.,A shortcoming though is the little analysis of big sitcoms like the Jeffersons and Seinfeld. The Last chapter especially needed more information on sitcoms of the 1990s. Overall a fantastic read, and David Marc is really nice and answers your email questions promptly."
2,This book is just a 70-176 exam suppliment!,"I didn't find this book comprehensive enough to give me the confidence on taking the 70-176 exam. Lots of important concepts were missed out.However, I like the softbound, pocketbook style of the book -- I can read it anywhere - on the bus or at a park. It isn't too bulky. I learned a few new concepts from this book too.If you plan to take the MSCD 70-176 exam, you'll need more references other than this to pass it."
2,This book is a real stinker!,"Review questions were bad. The chapters were unorganized and there was no clear path to follow.In fact, one section on Cursor Locations had incorrect information! (Tells us that a default setting is one value, but when you look it up in MSDN, it is really another!) YOU WILL NEED ANOTHER BOOK TO PASS, and this isn't it!"
1,"The book is too concise, not enough detail to be of value.","This book is well organized, has wonderful sailboat pictures, and is clear and concise. So concise in fact, that you wonder why you are reading it. It does have some good pointers on taking the tests, and it does outline much of the material included on the test. But it only provides an outline, not nearly enough information.. and it omits topics covered in other, better books. There are far too few sample test questions."
1,"You pay less, you get less...","I suggest buying and reading a different book if you intend to pass Exam 70-176. The sample quiz isn't even close to the questions in the exam. The contents are just the introduction of every topic, you won't learn anything new to help you out with the exam. The only thing nice about this book is that it's so easy to carry around anywhere."
1,Not well done,"This book is really not that good at all. Although I did not find any misstypings as in other books, it did mix a lot of things together which was very confusing. I'm planning on buying another book because this book did not clear things enough, and they did not cover everything on the exam. for example, they have no mention of DHTML yet it is on the exam."
2,Won't get you through the test,"I'm not an expert at VB, but I have good experience and this book was useful but not enough to get me through the test. Use this book only as a guide as to what to study in detail if you want to pass."
2,"Fast Track, yes, but not for the Exam!","I just wrote the 70-176 exam and do not remember seeing one question that this book helped answer.Do not get me wrong, the material in this book should be known by all VB Developers, but I don't feel it helped in any way with preparing for the exam.I am also confused by several reviewers who have mentioned DHTML being on their exams. The exam I wrote did not have any questions on DHTML. Although, as mentioned, neither did this book.I give this book 2 stars only because it was written to be an MCSD Exam Preperation book. Unfortunately, it is only a good read for VB Developers without the intention of using it for the purpose for which it was written. Otherwise it would have received 4 stars.FYI: I did pass the exam, but it was not because I read this book, twice!"
3,Good supplement for exam preparation.,"You cannot rely on this book as the only source of studying materials. It provides a good summary of topics that are covered in the exam. I picked up a few new tricks in VB6 from this book. To pass the exam, you need more..."
1,You get what you pay for....,"As one of the cheapest exam prep guides out there, you might be really tempted to buy this book. My advice is DON'T. Having taken the exam I can tell you that this book was absolutely no help at all. I finally passed the exam but mostly due to studying the Books Online and a couple of other books. Although this book is organized by exam objectives (a very good idea), most of the material is trivial and doesn't really address what Microsoft wants you to know. Don't let the low price fool you. This book isn't worth it."
1,BoxWave Capacitive Stylus Amazon,I was not pleased with this item I purchased from Amazon. The rubber tip is squishy and soft. When I tap on an item the rubber tip spreads out and I have to tap two or three times for it to work. It seems like the rubber is very low grade or it's all wore out. I've ordered stylus before from Amazon and never had a problem. It feels like the stylus was used up before I received it. I would appreciate it if you would tell me what you could do. about this problem.I know I won't be ordering another anytime soon.Thank You----MaryAnn
3,Can save you from pulling your gloves off but don't get any other expectations,"It does what it says it does, meaning it's a replacement for a finger, but that's not going to turn a tablet into a handwriting note taking machine.That's not due to any fault of the stylus, as it's easy and comfortable to handle. It's just that the capacitive screen technology isn't good enough due to poor accuracy, lag and loss of tactile feedback to replace a plain old paper notepad and a mechanical pencil."
2,boxwave stylus,Like having a stylus.really helpful needs to be longer and fatter. Would make it more comfortable to handle for people with big hands and arthritis. Also needs new top of some kind that will not come undone all the all the time.
4,stylus,I wish I knew what the little plastic thing is on the end of the string. It works better than my finger no smudges.
5,Excellent,Was sold at a good price and was exactly what I expected and keeps by screen from getting smudged up.
4,a good ppointer,yes the box wave is a good pointer sometime it does not read words pointed to.some time well.it take to long to memoriies
1,75% off promo broken,"The ""add both to cart"" link for the 75% off charger promo doesn't work.It adds the stylus and charger to the cart, but the charger ships from Boxwave. Because of this, the promo doesn't apply because it can only apply if Amazon shipped the charger.Problem reported to Amazon... No idea if the problem exists for the other Boxwave products the promotion is supposed to apply to."
5,BoxWave stylus,This was a present and it was pleased by the person who received it. I would buy it again for the Kindle Fire
4,Antidote for fat fingers.,The Kindle Fire is made more usable for fat fingered web surfers by having a pointing device like this one.
4,"Size runs big, but a great shoe","It took 3 tries to get ones to fit. I wear a 9-1/2, and even a 9 was too big. Very comfortable shoe"
5,"Take the Lead - An Excellent ""Life Lesson""","I enjoyed the plot of the movie (based on a real life story) of a man passionate about helping others. His method was different but he dared to stand up against the odds and persevered until he was allowed to help students. So should we do in real life. We should stand up against those that oppose what we do, when our actions are right. It was a great ""Life Lesson""."
2,**NOT Authentic Hawaiian Steel Guitar**,"This is NOT a collection of Hawaiian Steel Guitar.This CD is a fair collection of Hawaiian sounding songs played on a western pedal steel with a western rhythm section. No ukuleles or traditional Hawaiian tunings.It is a CD of 90% Hapa Haole (Hawaiiian sounding songs written by mainlainders) played on Pedal Steel Guitar by a western style player.Real Hawaiian Steel Guitar is played on a Non-Pedal Lap Steel and has a much more relaxed and slinky sound, with a more expressive vibrato. If you are looking for authentic Hawaiian steel, this CD is disappointing, if you just want something thats kinda Hawaiian sounding for background music between the bands at a party then this will fill the bill.I've added a link to a much more authentic and better produced Hawaiian Steel Guitar CDSteel Guitar Magic"
3,Pleasant but monotonous,"I love pedal steel, whether Hawaiian or Country. When I search for Hawaiian music I always go for the pedal steel emphasis rather than ukelele or other. This definitely showcases the steel playing, but the arrangements are so bland... one selection kind of dirges into the next. This is good for quiet background music, but not for being festive. I expect the traditional ""fun"" songs and the celebration of ""aloha"" to actually be exciting, rather than sound like lullabies. Worth having in your Hawaiian music collection because of the good steel playing, and the price (as listed at time of this writing) is a bargain."
5,This book will encourage your Christian prayer life.,This book is a spiritual autobiography of a man who ran multiple orphanages and a school by solely trusting in God to provide the support. George Mueller never asked any individual for money. This book will encourage the believer to place all of your cares and burdens on the Lord. The reader will be challenged to seek after God for who He is and not for what He gives. It will help take your prayer life to a new level. You can easily read it in two or three sittings.Read and reviewed by Jimmie Kepler
2,I wish I had my dollar back,"What a snoozer! I love Elliott Smith, but Andrew Morgan is a far cry from his late friend and mentor. I can't even listen to the entire album due to intense boredom."
4,Mysticism meets Reality in a head on clash,"I love this book. It gives me an insight into my own conciousness and is the most insightful book I have read in a ong time. i most definatley recomend ti, and also her book GreenMonkey dreams, which Amazon dont have buit it still rocks so get it!"
1,Scatterlings,"This book [stinks], why would you bother to write about some story that is absolutely boring has no meaning to the story what so ever. I was bored within the first page and only continued to read it because i had to for school."
1,THERE IS NO WAY TO CHECK IF YOU ARE RIGHT OR WRONG!!!,"The lab book for JOURNEY INTO SPANISH is no help and the ""Dictados"" are confusing. To make matters worse there is NO answer key for eaither book. I mean, there is know way to find out if you are right or not, correct or wrong. Please give the learners out there an ANSWER KEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,yep spanish,"one of the better Spanish textbooks I've had to use. large inline dictionary sections within the chapters allow you to find USEFUL words for speaking and writing Spanish unlike many books I've had in the past. would recommend to professors, teachers and people just wanting to learn to speak Spanish."
5,Awesome clamps,"I use the on all my lighting fixtures. They have removeable, replaceable inserts that let them adjust to many different size poles. very easy to use. I am looking at buying more."
4,What a nice little vibrator!,"I really like this little angel, and would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't broken the second time I used it. It was the soldering inside the control unit in my case as well, but it wasn't hard to fix. I actually bent the contacts and used a drop of liquid electrical tape, rather than going to the trouble of digging up my soldering iron. Throw it out? No way! It's a terrific little toy, and I spent nearly twice what Amazon is selling it for!"
2,A shoddy product,"The Angel Kiss was my first toy so I was very excited when I received it. But alas after only 10 days, it suddenly stopped working. I wasn't rough on it. The light on the battery pack still lights up but there are no vibrations to be had. I'm very disappointed since when it did work, it was great. If it was a reliable product, it would deserve 5 stars.I'm not very handy so I doubt I'll be able to fix it."
3,Mistake ???,"Is it my hear or there is a real mistake on the first movement of ""Three Movements"" ??At 5:33 ,the flutes seems to start a bar earlier ...I heard another version from DG and I haven't encountered same ""mistake""..."
2,Don't Buy This For Tehillim,"Steve Reich is my favorite classical composer, period. I own every CD he has ever released, including this one. Tehillim is a beautiful, breathtaking, and altogether must-have work... just not from this CD. Buy the ECM version instead.Why is the recording of Tehillim on this CD so bad? Like the other reviewer below, I honestly can't say. It isn't performed with any of the raw charisma and energy of the ECM recording. It comes off flat and lifeless.One other thing: Three Movements is really only interesting to people who know all of Reich's works."
2,Reich at his worst,"I believe that Three Movements was the last symphonic piece that Reich has written, and this comes as no surprise. He himself once said that when composing to an orchestra and not to his own ensemble he feels like he hass one hand tied behind his back. The piece is dull, Reich is falling to Glass's habit of recycling his cliches and the result can be used as an elevator muzak. Tehilim is a classic Reich piece, the only problem is that the original ECM recording is much superior: both technically and musically. It seems that there is more to this music than hitting the marimba at the exact time, although I cannot put my finger on what makes the ECM recording exiting and this one just accurate. Conclusion: This CD is only for Reich's hardcore fans. New to Reich ? Buy the Bang-on-a-Can CD: a wonderful introduction to the music of one of the pioneers of our time."
1,Product description is inadequate,"As another reviewer states, this DVD is a PAL DVD, and will not play in many US DVD players. Nowhere in the product description does it say that this is PAL. I would like to know where to find this item in NTSC format."
4,Family,"I love it ! Tom was fun Thomas is amazing, Shepherd unique. the start , bond between the twins strong, Tom 's father caring but preoccupy with life. New life interest short yet engaging. Finch silly,but scary even to himself. Usual kids interacting with each other,Caring even in a bad situation(the coat scene, and the heart attack guard,) the reward being let go for Thomas' kindness. The ending usual but good."
5,Classic Tenor Ballads - Amazing and wonderful,"For my taste, the tenor sax is the preeminent voice of jazz--and has been since the days of Hawkins, Young, and Webster. This album is out of that lineage, particularly the Ben Webster strain. Irv Williams (amazingly, now up in his 90s!) carries on that wonderful tradition of rich, deep balladeering for which Ben was so much beloved. This album was made by Irv when he was a young pup in his mid-80s, and it is amazing and wonderful. Beautiful velvet tone, exquisite taste, touching emotions and phrasing. It's all here, even that old Ben Webster breath vibrato. Pianist Peter Schimke offers lovely, empathetic support from the keyboard. Some of the tunes include ""I Can't Get Started,"" ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"" & ""My Funny Valentine."" Apparently the album's out of print and pricey. But if you run across it at a nice price, don't hesitate. Grab it, take it home, play it late at night with a martini and your sweetie by your side. It's that good. A real classic."
3,I like this product..,"This is good, but no comparison to exfoliating towels from Asia. I just didn't find this abrasive enough, and it got soft pretty quickly. It's a lot cheaper though, so can't complain about that aspect. Good for washing your back!"
5,Exfoliating and actually uses little of bath products,"Our whole family loves it and we even had some sent abroad. This is better than the pouf since it unfolds into a 3X1 piece that can be used to scrub the back. This also makes soaps/ shower gels and creams lather up easily so you use less product. It exfoliates well without being too abrasive. The first time you get this, if you feel it's too stiff, try rinsing it in warm water (it softens more with use.) You will see a big difference in the feel and texture of your skin even after just one use--lotions slide on better, skin is brighter, and even helped reduce back acne. And for this price plus the free shipping, it's a bargain especially for how long it lasts."
3,it is just scrubby Nylon material,"I just want to notify other potential buyers that this is just scratchy 100% nylon material, product of Taiwan. I went ahead and purchased based on others reviews that it was 90% cotton, mine is NOT, so I just wanted to set the record straight. I am going to keep the item as my husband does like it, nice and long enough to get his back. But this is too irritating for my skin. I am still searching for something better. This is nothing bad against the seller as they did not state what the material was made of."
4,A fun way to spend an hour or two.,"My wife and I play this game periodically, just to have some fun. It's a cute game in which you have to match the cards in your hand with the characters found on a photo card you select for the round. There are options for thwarting your opponent's efforts and some humorous commentary and remarks on the photo ID playing cards that will make you chuckle.In all this is a fun and entertaining game. I only wish they had more photo cards, we've been through them all already."
2,Second one purchased.... not because i liked it.,Ok it is very cute that's why i gave it 2 stars. I had to return the first one because the screws kept falling out of the handle. So i exchanged it for another one. WELL the second did the same thing. So my daughter would walk out of school with the handle dangling everywhere. They need to fix this flaw.
5,Superb Compilation,"I consider this one of the best Bossa Nova compilations on a single CD. It includes very interestring and truly Brazilian arrangements of popular bossa nova standards. For example, a couple of Jobim's songs from his album 'Composer' (1965) sound much better and more vivid here due to different arrangements.If you've already heard a lot of Jobim and want something new in the same style, then this is just for you."
3,Moderately Interesting,"These books are a valiant attempt to write science fiction in the idioms of traditional chinese literature. Unfortunately, these allegorical stories don't succeed particularly well. They are essentially Chinese style romances set in an interplanetary context. The result is not particularly interesting as science fiction and becomes essentially derivative and somewhat wooden romance tales. This could be the fault of the translations and it would be necessary to read the originals to be sure.Readers who are intrigued by the idea of combining the style of traditional Chinese literature with science fiction should read the work of Cordwainer Smith (Paul Linebarger), an American China scholar who wrote some of the best science fiction ever published."
3,Good helmet but not for under 2's,"I felt like the description of this product indicated it was for a toddler. This thing is way too big for my toddler, and she's a big one. I think, especially when you are dealing with items where size is important, the description should be a little more specific. Otherwise, a great helmet and a good price."
5,Excellent Resource,"I've purchased many books but this one is a must for anyone in recovery. It's comprehensive in scope, ranging from what AA meetings are like to helping one understand the many dynamics (emotional, physical, social, psychological, etc.) of the stages in recovery. I have found personal comfort in reading this book and I've learned more about the disease of addiction. Also helpful, are sections for loved ones to read with regard to their role during the different stages of recovery. It has been a valuable resource to me and for what it's worth, I highly recommend it for all learning about the many aspects of new life in sobriety."
3,its heavy on aa,"its really heavy on aa. avoiding that group was why i bought this book. but there was always a reference to that program somewhere in all the chapters. it provides good information that could have been put in a pamphlet, thats about as much useful info as i got from it."
3,Simplistic and much too focused on 12 step,"I bought this book ten years ago, when I first quit drinking. While it does contain some useful information, it is written in an overly simplistic, almost juvenile style that I found extremely annoying. Also, although there is a brief section on different treatment alternatives, all of the advice in the book assumes that the reader has chosen to go to AA/NA, so it really isn't a fair representation of the many alternatives out there."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,Amazing end to a great series! All the characters grow and change and the story is written and woven so well. Loved! There is a take off book called Taste of Lightning that is really good and follows a character from this set.This would be a great book for young girls 12 and up. About courage and strength and it's just fun to read! And there is just the right touch of romance that it appeals to moms too.
5,Great ending for a great series!,"The Tenth Power (Book 3 in the Chanters of Tremaris Trilogy)Starting with ""The Singer of All Songs"" this series is a wonderful fantasy through a world where chanters sing magic alive. Moving from a sheltered existence in a land surrounded by ice,Calwyn learns more about the world and herself. In this third and final book of the series, she comes full-circle to reenter her homeland in hopes of healing not only herself, but her beloved world. A great book with a strong feminine protagonist. ENJOY!"
1,Lacking...,"I loved the first two books. However, this one is rather shallow and lacks intensity. Everything happens too quickly and the mysteries solved too easily. Were the book twice as long, the author could have developed the characters better, and the story would have been more believable and more interesting. Samis' character really deserved more development, and his time with Calwyn more expansion. The ""aborted"" war was just ridiculous. If you really want to know how the story ends, borrow it from a library, just don't expect great literature."
5,awesome,"i love all the chanters of tremais books, this one most. it has a great story to tell. it tells what true loving really is. also unexpected twists are on almost every page of this amazing book. i really wish there was a fourth book."
5,the bestest of best books ever!!!!,"i have read lots of interesting books like dragonsinger and the book of three but this is the best book series ever! i found the first book(the singer of all songs)at a school thing, i looked boring so i just got it, one day i had nothing to do so i started to read it and i could keep away, i begged my mom to let me by the next one and she let me, the next day i was checking here to see if there was another one, i so totally wish that this was a longer series to see what calwyn,darrow,tonno,hasala and calwyn and darrow's child to be do next. i totally recomend this book to anybody who likes magic, and has a scence of adventure and likes fantasy and science fiction. Most peeps say this is stupid but if u have what i said, then u should love this bestest of best books ever alot!"
1,Turn back while you can!!!,Awful customer service.Let it be known that they refuse to EVER take a return because they claim that one could have tried it first with the free trial version.
4,Oldie but a goldie,"I absoutle love this game. Works perfectly on my Windows 7 computer. The graphics on the game leave alot to be desired compared to new games, but it is still so much fun to play."
5,Must Read,This book weaves together the author's story with the story of Birute Galdikas. The two tales have many similarities and their links are masterfully revealed. But it's the scathing portrait of Galdikas as a woman who lost her way and became a profiteer and a tyrant that is the most astonishing and chilling part of the book. It is a gripping and TRUE tale.
3,Sturdy but Bad Design,"This set is extremely sturdy, but the carrying case that it comes with leaves much to be desired. It's not designed to actually fit everything in it! You would think that would have been a concern when they were designing this."
1,outdated,The field is need of more recent research. Prof. Chaudron's ideas are stale and lack vision. Time for a changing of the gaurd!
1,A rude author,I emailed this author concerning a business-related matter. Paul Anderson was extremely rude and unprofessional. (This is of assuming I contacted the correct Paul Anderson. I believe I did as the person who provided me with his email was allegedly his literary agent: Jill Mast). If he was that rude to me via email correspondence then just how professional is his business-related book? You be the Judge!!!
3,So so,The casting on this pulley was extremely rough. Had to take files and sand paper to it to smooth out all surfaces including in the belt groove. This pulley would have torn up a belt if used as is.
3,"A thingy to put on a shaft, to turn a belt, which turns the armature, which generates electricity, as it moves past the brushes",It's a pulley. It fits the shaft and turns as expected.No moving parts.Not too much to get excited about
3,Models In The Making,"This is the only cycle I would buy. I actually watched it from start to finish. I really loved Camille's confidence, and that is something everyone should want to have. There is nothing better than self confidence."
5,Finally,I didn't start watching until they were in season 9. I got season 8 downloaded and purchased season 1 on dvd but could never find seasons 2-7. I have enjoyed seeeing it. It is much less scripted and interesting.
5,Cycle 2 is the Ultimate season of ANTM,"All 5 final contestants were worthy winners and all are just stunning. The Italy segment is THE clssic moment defining ANTM, and while Shandi brought the drama, ""innocent"" Yoanna provoked the situation. I was sure Shandi would win, and I would have been fine with that since she was/is aweseome, but Yoanna was my favorite. To this day, I think sh'es the most beautiful woman to ever appear on ANTM. This season rocks every step of the way, I've seen it like four times already and will totally buy this when it comes out."
5,Shipped to FPO AE. Love the product and the shippers. Thank You!!!,"I spend most of my time outside of the U.S in remote areas. I am behind on so many t.v shows. I can never stop watching enough of this show. I am addicted. Tara is awesome, great producers. Keeps getting better and better.However, when and where can i buy all of the seasons. I've only been able to find 3 or 4 seasons. Wassup with that? I want to buy all of them."
5,So glad to find this again,"This was one of my favorite ""Albums"" as a kid. Long out of print, I was thrilled to find it again. As of this writing there's another version still available at Amazon plus an MP3 download. I could do without the extra tracks that weren't on the original Nonesuch LP, but they can always be skipped over. If you like Bach and jazz guitar you can't go wrong with this."
1,Holes,"I'll keep this short and sweet. There are too many holes in this plot to make it believable. While I understand that it may have been written as ""young adult"" fiction, it is not placed in stores as such.Regardless of where it is, there are just too many holes in the plot to keep anyone interested. I can only hope that Mr. Turtledove will stick to the type of involved plot writing he does best, and abandon this sort of nonsense.Don't buy it, don't borrow it, don't bother with it."
1,curious notions,"This will be short but not so sweet. Every once in a while I see a book by Turtledove, pick it up, read the cover and buy it.When will I learn? Great ideas, poorly concieved story. H.Beam Piper is spinning in his grave. What do you people at TOR have hanging in your closets that you continue to publish Turtledoves garbage."
4,Minus 8 - Elysian Fields,"ELYSIAN FIELDS sees Minus 8 leaving behind drum `n' bass for more lounge, future jazz downtempo-style tracks. The smoothness is evident immediately: ""Neverland"" weaves in some acoustic guitar some Spanish rhythms and a lonesome flute, while ""Cold Fusion"" kicks back with some sultry vocals. But even though the musical competency is beyond reproach, the album seems to lack a bite, something that really grabs hold of you and shakes you. The two more house-oriented track, however, are an exception: ""Snowblind"" peppers a scat-like vocal over some funky breaks, while ""Badman & Throbin'"" makes no bones about its need to get you grooving (and you've got to love that ""fake ending""). The closing track, ""Sellafield,"" tosses in clean guitar line that contrasts the various noises surrounding it. While a good album overall, I would have like a little more meat here."
4,Great album,"Though this is a review of few words, do not let it make you think that this album isn't simply marvelous. This album was purchased probably 2 years ago and though I don't play it as much today, I still consider it one of the greatest albums I've ever gotten. Not including ""Nonhuman"", practically EVERY song on this album is also expertly produced as well.In the end, this album is great for someone desiring a twist from the normal sound of electronica."
5,I like this one.,"This is one of my favorites. I am built rather small down there and do not need something the size of a major league ball bat...hey, those things hurt. This is very slim, the action if good and I use it either solo or with my friend. Every so often she likes to get a bit creative and it is thin enough for that too. This is also waterproof and works well in the whirlpool, another feature I like. The length is just right for me. It is small enough to be discrete and travels well. The cost is small so I own four of them incase of a breakdown. I like the small head on it and love the milti-speed feature."
4,A teacher who really knows her stuff,"I learned under Ms. Karetnikova at Emerson College in Boston, and she is a very talented teacher. She knows how to take the raw material of a writer and encourage it to blossom into a script worthy of selling. Inga knows that her students are wanting to write scripts that will sell, and she teaches others in this book how to truly look at a script so they will know how to produce one themselves."
2,a rehash of the program's menus,"I was disappointed with this book. It is a reference organized by the menus that you would see while running the software.It spends most of the time on basic operations that you already know by using most Windows software, such as selecting objects, cut & paste, etc.I didn't learn much from this book."
2,"Wonderful music, terrible recording","It doesn't get any better than Grumiaux and Haskil, singly or together. However, the equalization on these CDs is horrendous. It almost sounds like RIAA recording equalization that hasn't been reversed for playback. With bass all the way up and treble all the way down, it is still terribly shrill."
3,"Awful recording, Very pleasant edition","This set is a real joy in everything but the recording.The set is very pleasant, it reminds me an LP, with presence, nice to look at, nice to feel. The booklet is in large enough print, and you don't have to struggle everytime you take it in and out.The performances are very good, but there are many good performances of this music. Many of them in much better sound.The recording is simply awful, and the piano sounds as if it was very far from the microphone.I am going to look for another set."
4,"Love the playing, the sound is ok",I wonder what the difference is between this set and the Decca 3 disc set also realeased in 2007 ?Strange
5,Great music,"Ray Wiley Hubbard has a new fan here. I found much of the music to be ""poetic"" and have listened to it over and over. Definitely a great sound."
5,Listen to good music.,"Hadn't heard this artist before but bought this album and really enjoyed it,this album is a must to own and listen to at any time,A+++++++++++++."
1,cheap,"cheap crap it broke the first day i got it, i was shaking my frappe and the top was loose then it feel on the floor from not too high and cracked and broke"
2,Not that great,"I've made my way a few chapters through. It seems to know what it's talking about, but it is not a self teaching tool. Too bad I go to a school that doesn't teach . . . :("
2,Hardly Explained,"I find it amazing that there were 3 other 5 star ratings for this book. While the authors do make an attempt to explain the requirements, for the most part, they take the cryptic ISO requirements and rewrite them in an equally cryptic fashion. Even the format of the book leaves much to be desired. The attempt at further explain by appending each section with definitions doesn't help. At least you get a free broken version of the standard. I'm going shopping for a better explaination."
3,Good but flawed,"The content of the book is generally quite good, methodically going through how to create a model, animate it, and use most of the major functions of Maya. However, sometimes certain steps are omitted, which the writers may think are understood, but as other instructions are very detailed and step by step it can be confusing.I find two major flaws, however. One is that the writers must have been using an earlier version of 7.0, as menu items described are different than the way Maya actually presents them.Also, many files are missing from the CD. The Chapter Files will not decompress on a Macintosh computer at all, and when transferred from a PC certain image files are missing. Whether this is a platform issue or a faulty CD I can't say, but it is frustrating to have to work around this."
4,Original Sextet,"I have the California 1954 Sextet concert on individual CD and the 2 CD set Complete Original Sextet Studio Recordings - The sound quality on both are very good. Zoot Sims does his best playing in the company of Gerry Mulligan, both here and on some of his later Concert Jazz Band recordings. Then in 1965 they did a quintet session for Limelight SOMETHING BORROWED, SOMETHING BLUE with Warren Bernhardt on piano but Gerry played alto sax on a track or 2 and it has not been put on CD, although a track from it appears on the compilation ROUND MIDNIGHT WITH GERRY MULLIGAN. Hopefully a place can be found for the other tracks where Gerry played Baritone Sax"
1,Don't waste your time/money...,"This oyster knife is awful. So dull it can't open anything. I can't imagine why anyone would design such a piece of garbage. I bought it because, to the eye, it looked like it might work. Product fail. It doesn't work. I got rid of mine immediately. Couldn't even think of an alternate use for the junk.I do recommendDexter-Russell 2-3/4-Inch Oyster Knife, Carbon Steel and Beechwood. Works wonderfully."
5,SO much fun!,Our famiuly loves the entire line of cranium games. It is a fun time to spend with our children.
3,Not so great.,"My son had this to play with in the bath tub. It winds up, and the paddle wheels spin, I am assuming to push it through the water. However it doesn't stay upright in the water, falls to its side and the wheels spin it around in circles. My son still played with it in the tub until the paddle wheels seized up and then we snuck it into the trash. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,So..so,"No, I didn't have lofty expectations for this bath toy, but there is a reason submarines are not driven by a water wheel.When not sunk 100%, my sub fell to it's side. When submerged, it doesn't really do much. Just think about it. Those water wheels on the side turn, there is not a propeller on the back. Water wheels only work when the upper portion is out of the water. I guess the toy just doesn't make much sense.Seems durable and relatively well made... for what it is.Honestly it will work better rolling across your kitchen floor. Maybe that is actually the intent?"
2,Why bother??,Didn't really care for this toy and neither did my son. It's ok but I would direct my money elsewhere.
5,Unbelievable,This album is a hidden gem. Do yourself a favor and go get it. She has an amazing voice and a knack for writing. You won't regret it.
2,"Very good writer, ok+ singer ...........","She wrote a killer song (Let It Rain) and even did a pretty fair job of singing it, considering singing is not her strong suit. But please, someone send this song to Lucy Woodward. That way, Lucy gets better known as the incredible rising star she is, and Keri gets to do more of what she's really good at - writing.Since writing the above, and after futher listening and reflection, maybe ""Let It Rain"" is so good because Keri's voice suits it so well. Sometimes when a voice and a song fit perfectly, magic happens that no-one else can repeat. I hope she's got more of that magic in her.Now its May 08 and I just keep liking that song more. I'm going to put it in a movie soundtrack one day if someone doesn't beat me to it."
4,Still my favorite....,"I've had this album over a year and I still love these songs as much as when I first heard them. It's the perfect blend of beautiful song writing, an angelic voice, and simple piano accompaniment. I first heard Keri on a radio station in my home state of MN and was hooked from the instant I heard ""Talk to Me"" on the air. I must admit that some of her songs took a few listens for me to love them, but once I stopped to listen to the lyrics and to appreciate how gorgeous and rich her voice really is, I was hooked on all of them. My only regret is that I missed her when she was here in Boston. I love how she manages to portray through lyrics a woman who is strong and confident and yet raw with emotion. She's a rare gem and although I believe she deserves to be famous for her vocal talent and someday will, it's fun to feel you've discovered someone so talented on your own."
4,Yalom improves with age,"This is literary improvement over some of Yalom""s more didactic earlier works. The plot is gripping, and, as usual, Yalom manages to get in a lot of interesting professional material, this time on group therapy. The novel seems rather transparently autobiographical, even mentioning one of his patients from an earlier (non-fiction) work."
4,Schopenhauer and group therapy,"I have ambivalent feelings about this book. As a novel it doesn't work well for me. The characters seem driven by the author's interests in group therapy, not by their own being, and it is disjointed. You get a chapter on Schopenhauer, then a chapter on group therapy, and so on until the rushed ending, which has a forced, expected feel. However, I really enjoyed reading it! I couldn't put it down, and even though I had already guessed the climax, when it arrived I was moved to tears. I liked the chapters on Schopenhauer and found myself caring for the characters. This novel is a mirror; it reflects your fear of death, your obsessions and anxieties, your broken places, and offers redemption. I can't wait to read the author's novel on Nietzche."
3,a contrivance for sermonizing,"A perfect mensch of an aging psychiatrist gets melanoma with a prognosis of ""one good year."" In crisis, he recontacts a former patient--a ""treatment failure"" who embodies schizoid personality disorder by relating only to the late (and also schizoid) German philosopher Schopenhauer.The shrink brings the patient into a therapy group. The group reels in reaction but ultimately ""cures"" the patient. Everyone lives happily ever, except the psychiatrist (who is redeemed) and Schopenhauer (who is irredeemable).People need active, healthy relationships. Get it?I have nothing but respect for Yalom as a clinician. His textbooks on group and existential therapy are famous for good reason and his popularized clinical vignettes (_Love's Executioner_) are warm and thoughtful. _The Schopenhauer Cure_, however, is a disappointment. It's not so much a novel as a contrivance for sermonizing."
4,A Bit Cheesy -- But the Schopenhauer Parts are Great!,"If you are a fan of Schopenhauer, get this book. There are things in here that will surprise you. As a novel... well, I'll be polite. I've read better. It doesn't really work as a novel. But as an exploration of the basics of Schopenhauer (with a few surprises thrown in), it is very worthwhile, even valuable."
3,You Have to Like Schopenhauer,"The book was difficult for me to read. You have to be into the history of Freud, Schopenhauer and other greats. I wasn't and the plot is difficult to follow - what was it: healing, death, snobbery? I couldn't even get into the characters."
4,Yalom on death,"Although this book repeats much of what Yalom has written before about existential issues in psychotherapy it has some fresh perspectives and interesting case histories and Yalom speaks of his own existential struggles as well. A quick read, and for those who have not read some of his denser material, a good primer on his existential framework for psychotherapy which, in this reader's view, has considerable merit"
3,Yalom is always interesting...,"I've been a fan of Yalom's work, and this book, while interesting, is not his best. I recommend Love's Executioner or The Gift of Therapy. In The Schopenhauer Cure, the majority of the group therapy characters were not well drawn, and it takes a while to differentiate between them. Pam and Philip were two characters that were better developed, but not likable. Philip's stoicism was intriguing, yet somehow unbelievable. Some of the dialogue seemed contrived.Having said all that, I believe it is worth reading to get a glimpse of the inner machinations of group therapy.The best result of reading this book is that it made me give some thought about death. Reading Schopenhauer is pretty dreary business, but I love his question of why we concentrate on where we will be after death, and ignore where we were before birth."
5,Five Big Shiny Stars,"This hardback book arrived within the expected dates. The description said it was signed by the author and it actually is! I was so very happy. The quality of the book is simply amazing, just as promised. Five big shiny stars for this product. Everyone I have talked to has had said that this is Yalom's best book. I have read ""Love's Executioner"" and ""Momma and the Meaning of Life"" and thought both were top-notch, Outstanding books. I can't wait to read this one! A must-read if you are a fan of Yalom, psychotherapy process groups, and anything funny, riveting, and existentially profound in psychology."
2,Incredibly trite,"As a philosophical survey of Schopenhauer this book was merely uninteresting, however melded with the absurdly stilted characters, dialogue and plot it left me thankful that I've never had the pleasure of attending one of Dr Yalom's group therapy sessions."
2,It was very disappointing,I was disappointed in the material as I was expecting some real complex insight. The last three pages were the best and very sentimental for alot of reading of material that is already well know in my professional field.
4,good step by step on basics,"This was a little hard to follow in places but I think it is good for the price. The author really tries to guide you step by step through detailed processes. It's true it does not cover the fixing of wood cracks, perhaps because the author may consider it to be major restoration rather than repair. I think it is best on bow rehairing, and on nut, bridge and soundpost repairs. It does touch on seam re-gluing and on fingerboard repair and neck re-set, but very basically. There are some typos and occasionally something is described out of place, such as a rehairing clamp is referred to on p. 9 but not fully described until p. 12."
2,Violin Repair Guide,"The book is titled ""Violin Repair"" it showed how to set up a violin but not how to make repairs."
1,Don't Bother!,This book is a waste of money. The diagrams are not adequate and there are no photographs. The store sited in the book is a phone number not an on-line business. This might help a professional but then again why would a pro need it. For the beginner it is a waste of money.
1,the directions are terrible,"The book has some good information in it. BUT the descriptions of the work must have been translated from some other planet. I have done 4 bows with it and every time it confused me as to his left side or my left side,I have written a lot of notes in the book. At this point I might as well write my own version of what he or she is talking about, because you just can't follow what the heck they are talking about."
4,Fun! Too Short.,"It was a good game, but way too short. I finished it in a weekend. Also I was able to run it on my 1.66 processor. Have fun!"
3,Too Easy,"I enjoyed this game. The crimes were interesting and the evidence was fun to collect and analyze. My biggest complaint is that it was far too easy. The game is rated for 16+ and for good reason, however it's so easy to solve the crimes a 10 year old could master it.Throughout game play you can get hints from your mentors, but I didn't need them. I got this game 2 days ago and have already solved all of the cases at a ""master"" level. I am not a member of Mensa, either - just an average middle aged woman.I'm also a fan of the Nancy Drew games and am surprised to say that those games, rated for much younger players, are actually more of a challenge to solve than this one.This game is fun though, it's engaging and entertaining with lots of great puns thrown in for laughs. Just don't expect to be very challenged by it."
1,Caution on Buying,"Unless you have 2.0 Ghz or better processor on you're computer/laptop, you are unable to play this game. Even if you have Windows XP, it's not enough. It also cost a lot to upgrade your processor to the right speed, so it might not be worth it."
4,Good but repetive,"CSI Hard Evidence is a good game the only problem is that it's a little too repetive. It feels like an expansion pack, with some new features and cases, for CSI 3 dimensions of murder. Someone said you have to have at least a 2ghz processor to play the game, but that's untrue because I'm running it with a 1.7something ghz processor. My final though is, get this game if your a big CSI fan. If not than borrow, or rent it."
4,Worth the money,"I have played all the CSI games, and this one was definitely easier to navigate than the last. It was almost too easy to play, which was a little sad. It also was just not LONG ENOUGH. It only took a few days to get all the way through. I would recommend it to the not too serious gamers as a hit."
1,Almost $20.00 and Another Sleepless Night Later...........,Sorry SleepMD - we are not impressed. Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too. Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off. No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so. So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It's a waste of money.
1,Ineffective,I bought three boxes of Sleep MD hoping for a promised great night's sleep. Didn't. Would not recommend this porduct to anyone
2,"Not for everyone, apparently","I haven't had a decent night's sleep in over 3 weeks and I realized every sleep aid I was using had diphenhydramine in it, so I decided to go the natural route and picked this up at a discount store. I did fall asleep quickly, but my dreams were really bizarre. I woke up once during the night, and fell back asleep quickly to more crazy dreams. When I woke up I had a horrible headache and spent about 6 hours feeling like I needed to throw up. I hope that's not how it always is, but I'm not willing to risk it to find out. I bought a $3.59 bottle of 3 mg melatonin from the grocery store and slept like a baby last night. I feel great this morning, too!"
1,load of crap,"One star is too much.It doesn't work at all, in fact it kept me up more than my insomnia.Puts you to sleep fast? Myth!!!!!Helps keep you asleep longer? Myth!!!! Waste of money. Where's the website? Doesn't exist. Too bad they don't have a money back guarantee!"
2,Don't believe the hype,"After trying this product, I am disappointed. It is not all that it is hyped up to be. Instead of helping me sleep better, it caused me to be more awake. I tossed and turned after taking this product MORE than I did before taking this product.I will have to find something better or more effective."
1,Sorry to add to the misery but ..,"Sleep MD did not work. I tried taking it with milk, juice and even coffee. Nothing seemed to bring out the sleeping ingredients. But reading these comments made me a little sleepy which is why I added my own. Good night!"
1,Didn't work for me.,"Didn't work for me. Which I didn't expect it to. Little drugs help me fall asleep anymore. I have used Ambien which worked for a while but then wore off. I tried Ambien CR which did nothing but make me feel dizzy. I have tried Rozeram which had the least affect, felt as if I took nothing, didn't help whatsoever. Same thing can be said about SleepMD, glad it helps others, but had not the slightest effect on me. The only thing I have found to work is a switch between Doxysuccunate, and Diphenhydramine, or mixed together. They are starting to wear off though and i'm having to double and even triple the does to get the same effect. The only thing left is to go back to the doctor and try Lunesta, or perhaps participate in a sleep study."
2,Sleep MD is just Melatonin..don't waste your money,"All Sleep MD is, is Melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in. You can get Melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost. Melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid, but you don't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it! Sleep MD is a total rip off."
1,SleepMD did not work for me,This product did not work for me at all. I tried only 3 days and stopped taking this product.
1,Sleep Meds,Both my wife and I tried this for aseveral nights. All it did was give us nightmares and diahria. We threw three boxes of it away
2,Sleep MD,"While the ingredients in Sleep MD seem like they would aid you in getting to sleep, it had no effect on me. Whenever I would take one of these pills before going to bed, I would have many vivid, sometimes insane dreams. I consider this a positive side-effect, so I'm giving it two stars. I suppose others may view it as negative, but to each his own.I recently used up all the pills and am contemplating whether or not to buy another box simply for the dreams they give me. Seriously, dude, these dreams are INSANE. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night with a horrible fear of impending death, with no idea why I feel that way. Other times I dreamed of all sorts of strange, yet fantastic creatures all around me. Oh, and it also gave me sleep paralysis a couple of times (I woke up but was unable to move any part of my body other than my eyes for about 10-15 minutes)."
1,Sleep MD,I was very disappointed in this product. It did not perform as expected and I won't purchase it in the future
2,Sleep MD,"They claim that it helps you fall asleep and keeps you asleep. I did fall asleep sooner, but wasn't able to stay asleep. I didn't find it to workwell at all."
2,Not that great,"Sleep MD does what it says, in a way. it helps me drop off to sleep. I go to bed around 9-ish, and I take one then. I'm asleep within half an hour, but I always wake up at 3am, and am wide awake and unable to get back to sleep. I had much better luck with melatonin drops I got from my chiropractor that I took 3 times a day than these things. Plus, they were a LOT cheaper. I have a hard time functioning with less than 8 hours of sleep, and while the melatonin drops gave me that, Sleep MD can't even allow me 6."
2,Broke right away,Stand broke as soon as I set up a medium size heirloom dinner plate. Luckily the plate did not break when it fell off the shelf.
2,"Feeble, Flimsy Thing",This plastic plate holder is really flimsy. It has to be kept against a wall or some hard surface. Think twice before buying this item!
3,Plastic plate stands,"These are nice but I can't believe that they would have originally cost $50. They are PLASTIC, for heaven's sake!!! That wasn't a surprise, as it says so in the description, but it's just unbelievable. I do like the fact that they are clear and don't ruin the looks of my plates."
5,love these girls,"I got one of these dolls for my 7th birthday, back in 1990. I loved it so much!! So I was thrilled to see I can still buy them, more than 20 years later, for my own daughter. She is 6 now and she looks forward to her new doll every birthday. This is a tradition you should start! Even if your daughter is already a few years old."
3,A Strange Combination,"I feel that this update of the See For Miles version of ""The Singles A's & B's"" is a bit flawed. The sound is amazing in mono (where the original was issued in stereo) but the material can already be found in the 4 CD Box Set ""Zombie Heaven."" PLUS, the omission of the US Only Single ""I Want Her Back Again/I Remember When I Loved Her"" really hurts the difinitive-ness of this set. If you want the complete set of mono mixes stick with the box set...it's not as streamlined as this CD but it gives you everything you want from the Zombies. Big Beat has done a great job so far with upgrading the Zombies' catalog for the digital age and what I'd really like to see next is a singles set featuring newly remastered stereo mixes (including the US Only single)."
1,If you like Stage 1 & 2 don't bother with 3.,Nothing like Satge 1 or 2. What appeals to me about the first two is the majority of the songs were written for women and performed by men. Stage 3 is more of an adult contempory album. It could be placed with those you buy on the budget rack at your local Fred Meyer.
1,In reponse to the review...,"I would like to respond to the person suggesting the key to success for these recipes is to substitute Splenda for Stevia. Hello??!!! The whole point of Stevia is that it is a natural sweetener, not a chemical who's long-term effects ARE untested and will likely end up the way of toxic aspartame. This review did not help me decide at all whether this book is worth purchasing."
5,Bleeding Bass,"The first and arguably the best of Cocteau Twins. The lilting Fraiser and heavy watery bass is still my favorite of all the C.T. albums, I have the original and I cannot say how the re-issued remastered version compares"
4,great when wacked out,This disc is great when you're in the hospital being pumped full of drugs and not knowing if you'll make it through the afternoon. It kinda makes you realize that there are far worse places in the world than your own head.
5,Very unique book!,"I agree this book is very well written. The characters are very believable and well developed. Althea, the main character, will challenge you in your own walk as a believer. Simon, the male counterpart, is a Jewish man who is really in some ways is the family's ""sacrificial lamb"" to acquire their representative in the English government. This really is a very profound book for a first time author, or any author! My only complaint is that in giving Althea's traumatic past the author gives a more graphic description (I'm talking one line) than I think is appropriate for a Christian Novel. It compares to Christy by Catherine Marshall. My concern is not the married woman that read it but the unmarried Christian women. But other than that this book is superb!"
5,Organizational history.,"Hutchinson, a history professor at Canada's Simon Fraser University, exhaustively recounts the early history of the Red Cross from its origins in the 1860's to the 1920's, finding an untoward identification with militarism in the age of total war.Starting with its pacifist beginnings, issues and organizational philosophy are thoroughly discussed, but those interested in the actual wartime operations of the organization are advised to look elsewhere, as these matters are hardly touched upon in this work.(The 'score"" rating is an ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not ""score"" books)."
1,Poor quality of image and sound,"I am a big fan of Jimmy Smith, have been collecting his CD over past 10 years, this DVD was really made me upset cause the quality of sound and image was poor. Again, it is not worth to pay for it."
3,great album of odds and ends,"this cd picks up where kill the musicians left and contains 52 tracks of live,demos,alternate takes and songs never before released. this is a great double cd and i suggest you buy it now."
3,Don't always buy the awesome reviews.,"Reading the reviews on this book I said to myself this is the book that will cater all the relevant information on orthopedics, like a first-aid for orthopedics. Sadly this was not the case, the book is extremely good on some topics but very deficient in others & I emphasize FRACTURES which we can all argue is the core of orthopedics. Another deficiency is that it doesn't talk about orthopedic tumors which I understand is an advanced topic but even simple basics are not addressed. All in all said it's good but not all inclusive, Netter's concise orthopedic anatomy on the other hand is a different story."
3,OK,"The book itself is not very in depth as far as covering everything in orthopedics. You only get a short list of diagnoses for each body part which won't help when asked specifics on tests or boards. Overall, the book was helpful, but certainly NOT all inclusive"
5,TOUCHING,Its been a long time since I read a book that touched me the way Daughter has. After reading The Prisoners Wife I was looking forward to reading asha bandele's next book. One Sunday while attending the 5th Ave Book Fair in NYC I had the pleasure of meeting asha and her daughter. I was fortunate to have her autograph my copy of Daughter. I couldn't wait to start reading and once I started I wasn't dissapointed.I was swept up in the story of Miriam and Aya. As a mother with 2 daughters I understand the delicate balance of the mother/daughter relationship.asha bandele is as very talented writer and I look forward to reading more from her.
4,The Dreams of Children,"This is a book that I truly enjoyed, and felt compelled to stick with for its entirety. It is enjoyable to read a book by an author that is not steeped in the he said/she said life of gossip ridden, syrupy love lost life spaces. It is a simple story about a woman that made choices, some good, some not so good. How she was able to cope with these choices, how she placed importance on her child being able to suceed until the child was mistaken for another hoodlum, yes is happens far too frequently in our nieghborhoods and the remedy is not for me to discuss it here. One choice was the action that mother took when she sought to correct the second wrongful death that occured in her life. I found the book to be well written and very entertaining. I highly recomend this novel."
4,Good Kitchen Sponges,What can you say - These are standard sized cellulose kitchen sponges. They are good quality and work like you would expect.
5,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought this for a cheap price because I wanted sponges to wash dishes with at my college dorm. No surprises, these aren't the best, but they're sturdy enough and I don't feel too guilty if I throw them out after a particularly nasty session with the communal frying pan."
3,Bargain price,"If you live in New York City, you pay $1 more for a package this size. It's a bargain. The sponges are just ordinary quality, okay for doing dishes."
5,"Great sponges, great price","These sponges are great for kitchen dishes. I have found as long the sponge is run out well after use, they take a longer than most sponges to get musty/moldy."
3,Great Rare Footage... Will not play on most American DVD Players.,"This footage is Great. It wasn't the video I was looking for, but it was filmed at the same place. I received this video and was really excited to get it...Until I realized it's in PAL format.. It will play on your computer, but not most home entertainment systems unless you live in Europe, where it was packaged. Filmed in American, packaged in Europe? So that was a major let down. I hate wathcing movies on my laptop. That is why I but movies. So.. Wathout for the bull they are printing about NTSC."
2,It works...but only for a little while,"This product first and foremost will work. It'll do what it says, which is keep your ipod going. However, that's where the truth ends. I bought this product in 2005 and it worked for about 2 months. During these two months it ate batteries faster than you can believe. Not just that, but after those 2 months it just stopped working all together.I've researched more and realized there are WAY better options. I'm not gonna mention which ones so that people won't think I'm advertising for another product, but trust me, do some more research and you'll thank yourself. There are other products now that that are rechargeable, and even the one's that use batteries are better than this. They'll cost you a little more, but you basically get what you pay for. I bought this because of the price, and trust me, I got what I paid for."
1,Anne M. Lindbergh: A Life,"Ms. Hertog is not a writer, but more a compiler of other people's writings. It is obvious that she has strong feelings against Charles Lindbergh for various reasons, and therefore, spends more time presenting his errors and weaknesses than in presenting Anne Lindbergh's strengths. She has not caught the real essence of a warm and delightful person. I found this book fragmented and disturbing."
1,You should have read the diaries,"After reading the book I feel sad that this author never had access to AnneMorrow Lindbergh's diaries and papers, for if she would have she might have written something closer to the truth.I say to those who have read Anne Morrow Lindbergh's diaries and letters: You will be shocked to find that this book follows the same media sensationalism that the Lindberghs tried to flee from in the 1930's. It is sad to see that these lies are still haunting them today.Anne Morrow Lindbergh is a hero for women everywhere. Because she often sat in her husband's shadow not many people are aware of the incredible accomplishments she achieved"
4,A good overview of Ann's life,This is an very well researched bio of Ann and her family and all of the others players. I was a little put off by the reference to Ann as having had a blue collar life. She was surely from the privileged and wealthy. And having a $1 million wedding gift in 1930's would make her a very rich woman. Ann's life was facinating and her books have endured for more that 75 years. I do believe the author tried way too much to tell us what Ann was trying to say in her books and read more into the subtext than Ann had in mind. Ann's stories can stand on their own and her prose is memorable and appropriate. Some times a great story told well is just that a great story.
2,A crashing disappointment,"Having read Anne Morrow Lindbergh's diaries, her daughter Reeve's first memoir, Berg's biography of Charles, and Gift from the Sea, I was truly looking forward to this biography. Knowing that the author had interviewed Mrs. Lindbergh, I was expecting new insights into someone who, I believe, was one of the 20th century's most remarkable women. What I found instead was a rehash of all the material I had previously read linked together with lame ""psychological insights"" and platitudes.Another thing that bothered me was her considerable reliance on the published diaries without taking into account that they were edited for publication, and by Charles at that, who saw them as a way to refurbish his public image, using his wife's popularity following the publication of Gift from the Sea.In short, there is no depth to this book at all."
4,Tennis Elbow Relief,It helps with my tennis elbow. How I got tennis elbow I don't know because I only play ping pong and I haven't done that in a year. It works though and I like it.
4,Works Perfectly!,"I used this for the first time at CrossFit last night, and it worked perfectly! We did a lot of lifting, running & squats and I was sweating like crazy, and THE BAND STAYED IN PLACE! That was a problem I've had with other straps of this type, but this one did the job and didn't slide down my arm when I did a tough workout. Highly recommend!"
4,Great item -- don't use in dishwasher,"I love this item. Such a handy tools in the kitchen for measuring sour cream, honey, ketchup, shortening, etc. I had another one that lasted 10+ years but I washed it in the dishwasher repeatedly and it got harder and harder to push until I just couldn't use it anymore. As long as you handwash it....this thing should last forever."
2,Very Dry,"I thought this book was very boring and very dry. This book was chosen by my history professor for my History of American Foreign Relations class so I had no choice in reading this book. Some parts were very interesting, and it held my attention for a while, but then the authors would go back to the dry and monontonous tone that put me to sleep. If you're a history buff, you might enjoy this book. If not, I don't suggest you buying it."
1,"Ted's music is great, but the sound is 30's!","I love Ted Heath's music. My first stereo LP (and one of THE first stereo LP's) was Heath's ""Hits I Missed"" which had great stereo imaging and London's famous fidelity. I still have it and it sounds better than ""Euphoria.""Euphoria is just another of those, ""Let's grab some music that's timed out on its copywrite, put it on a CD and sell it."" There was no warning ""Mono recording"" in the description, although it was on the disk label.Ted Heath did some wonderful stereo, hi fi recordings. This isn't one of them. To be fair, this CD may have some historical value but I was looking for Heath's music and some decent sound.Let's hear some more reviews on Ted Heath's CDs. I would love to find a great one (besides the Glenn Miller tribute, that is.)"
5,A Family Favorite.,"This book is so charming. The Illustrations are amazing. My sons 15 and 8 have cherished it for years. Owney, a homeless dog who wins the hearts of postal workers, found in a mailbag. True story of his adventures, a great family book."
2,it looked too good to be true.,"this bag is beautiful: smooth genuine leather, cool pockets, and aged look. But the zipper broke after one week, and the metal hooks for the straps failed after a month. I wish I could say that maybe I tended to overload it, but I didn't. This is about a quality issue, not my ruthless use.Maybe i just got a bad batch?"
2,too basic even for the beginner,"if you want something with new styles,i wouldnt choose this book.it has the ""old"" favourites like pull backs,basic braid and even a pony tail(and yes it even tells you how to twist the hair elastic around the ponytail!)it does include hair wraps,instructions for hair accessories and corn rows and fish tail braids(which are slightly more advanced than the others but still in the beginners bracket)for clearer instructions(for all the braids in this book and more)id recommend ""braids and bows"" by anne akers johnson and for the more unusual(if you can call it that)id recommend ""more beautiful braids"" by patricia cohen.this would be good for beginners but as it includes instructions for the ponytail(who in the world cannot do a ponytail?)even the beginnr may be reluctant to use this book."
2,Its ok,I'm sorry but I never knew how to do a French braid and this book just confused me further. The other braid ideas are good. I never heard of of a fish tail braid. Looks interesting. Can't wait to try it on my 3-year once her hair gets longer.
5,Read It Now!,"A very engaging read on what can be a difficult topic. Babitz' style is entertaining, filled with interesting and humorous analogies that forcefully support his point. I was somewhat skeptical to some of his views...this book made me a believer."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I order from Amazon a lot and am usually very satisfied, however, not with this electric smoker! The box was all messed up when we received the package. I ordered an electric smoker but this is a charcoal smoker with an electric converter! No manual to assemble the electric part and the user manual is for a charcoal smoker. THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Order the regular electric smoker......it's less than $100! This grill is warped, missing pieces and can't find out where to put the lava rock! Total disappointment!"
1,Damaged and missing parts.,"The first grill arrived damaged. The RMA process was very easy and a replacement was processed while the defective product was being returned. Received second unit 3 days after, which was pretty good reaction time. Putting it together I found missing parts, clips to hold on grate and cover. Called the 800 number to report missing parts and received a messaged the company was closed and to call back during specific buisness hours. I called back the next day and again received a message that the company is closed for annual Christmas party and to call back on the next buisness day. The next buisness day is Monday, so I have another 2 days before I can even report the missing parts. I really want this product, but am disappointed on how hard it has been and it's still not resolved. I hope I can try this out before year end."
3,Not for everday use,The smoker had to be put together and tightening the screws was not the easiest thing to do. Limited placement for cooker due to extreem heat from the base and the short electric cord. The food is not as tasty as a charcoal or gas smoker.
3,Not all made from stainless steel,"The water pan not stainless steel, or aluminum, it looks like it is plain steel and painted over with black non- stick coating. Mine came chipped and it only took few days that it rusted where the metal was bare. I am sceptical to put water in it. The charcoal pan isn' t stainless steel either, it will develop chips in the paint and will rust horribly.Another serious problem is that it is diffiuclt to light the charcoals and place the charcoal pan in its place inside the smoker. IT is situated so low, it' s exptremely dangerous. The charcoals should be lit while the pan is inside which is deep down and it makes it tough to be able light the charcoals.Anothe thing, with lit charcoals it' s tough to place the water pan and fill it with water without accidentally touchign the perimeter of the smoker and develop a burn. They are situated deep inside the smoker. Teh same with the first lower grill.It should have some bigger sideways openign to load/ unload it."
3,"Good Grill, bad delivery","The grill itself is solid and a good size. It just arrived with no instructions or photos for assembly and I have a ton of leftover screws without any other holes and am not sure if its assembeld correctly. The grill itself is good, the packaging left alot to be desired."
4,Does what it needs to do,"I got this item for my husband for Christmas, and I don't know much about these things, but after many of hours of research this was the most bang for the buck. I was easy for him to assemble (less then an hour). It is compact (fits under our grill for storage). We have gotten it to 325 degrees without water, but it could use a thermoater (we had to go buy one to go in it) and he doesn't like the fact you can not control the temperature it is either on or off. But he used it the other day and was just beaming so overall a good buy."
2,Poor product this Brinkman,I currently have two Brinkman Pro Series grills that I Love one for home cook outs and one tailgate we use for camping. I don't know what Brinkman was thinking on this one .It's seems so cheap looking.like a after thought to get something on the market.Come on Brinkman you can do better than this!
3,Quality but not self-standing,"Quality products, nice size but not self standing due to no lock mechanism. It's retractability makes it wobble when self-standing."
3,Inexpensive Perpetual Calendar Fairly Accurate Quartz Watch,"This is an inexpensive perpetual calendar watch which works well. It fits my eight inch wrists (stainless steel bracelet made in China) and the movement is made in Cebu, Philippines. The case is brass; but there is a stainless steel backing which touches one's skin (wrist.) It is easy to set the time and the watch keeps good time. The back lit illumination system works great at night or day. The date is a little small; but with glasses on I can read it. The face is large and easy to read. It has a conventional glass lens. It is a little tight on my wrist; not uncomfortable yet I might look for another band or link. I currently use it as a night clock by the bed at night; since it lights up well at night."
5,Absolutely Delightful Book,"This absolutely delightful book is beautifully illustrated. Mrs. Twiggenbotham is a grand motherly woman who does not see very far but she sees far enough to reach people with loving concern. She shares kindness and baked goods with people who need a bit of cheer. Three of her best recipes are at the end of the book. While designed for children 4 to 8, this book is a delight for the adults with whom the children share it."
5,Excellent live recording!,"This is a really amazing recording of two incredible artists. The high-energy interplay between Burton and Corea is extremely intense, but not overpowering. The more hushed numbers are equally as fascinating and the two artists' feather touch as both an ensemble and as soloists is breathtaking. There are more tracks on the vinyl version, but it's still an incredible album. Very accessable to more traditional jazz lovers, too."
1,Counterfit CHI Round Ceramic Brushes,"I currently own a set of AUTHENTIC CHI round ceramic brushes. I bought the 1.5"", the 2.0"", and the 3.0"" CHI Round Ceramic Brushes from Omni Solutions. BUYER BEWARE, they are selling counterfit CHI round ceramic brushes for the authentic price. This is the worst experience I have had buying online. I am asking for a refund."
1,Not What I Ordered,"The description of this item is a Medium 2.0"" brush, however the brush I received in the mail was tiny and not even close to 2"" in diameter. This small round brush does not work on my long hair. I ended up going to Ulta to purchase the actual 2"" brush and it is great."
3,A fair book that could (and should) have been better.,"This book is fair, so far as it goes. The translating, on the whole, is excellent -- very little hard-to-understand language. The photographs are so-so, but contribute very little. As I read the book, I found two things irritating: First, there is a frequent use of German Army abbreviations, but there is no glossary or other translation (simple paretheticals would have sufficed). Second, there are only a few maps and they are either so pale, so small, or so cluttered as to be virtually useless.The information given is interesting and well put, allowing for a certain formality of style. The reader certainly leaves the book with an understanding of the problems facing the German commanders.All in all, it's a shame. The idea is splendid, but the execution is disappointing. It falls down on the side of clarity, and that could have been avoided."
3,HD Formatting is Poor,"When watching this on an HD set, there are two blurry bars added to the sides of the standard definition imagery to make it fit the HD format. It wouldn't be too bad except you can see unrelated motion in the semi-clear sidebars making it very distracting. The content is fine, just the presentation and technical aspects are poor."
5,A Tribute to Billy Joe is one of the best CDs out there,"I cannot take this CD out of my player. I love the stories that Todd Snider, Jack Ingram, Joe Ely, Robert Earl Keen and all the others tell about their songwriting hero, Billy Joe Shaver. And the songs are incredible! I highly recommend this album!"
4,Great Collection of Rug Rats,Season 5 is a great Collection of Rug Rats for anyone who enjoys them. The only downside was the packaging for the 4 Disc set. My set came with a damaged inner case so two discs could not be held safely. Easy fix with some slimline cases and the use of a color copy machine to make a second cover. Thankfully this set was only 4 disc and not 6 like Season 1.
5,Bought one for friends then husband just had to have his own too!,We first saw these for sale in the gift shop at Yankee Stadium. We just had to tell our good friends about the set because of their in-family Red Sox/Yankees rivalry and we ended up ordering one for them to give as a Christmas gift. Turns out my husband was so taken with the thing he had to get a set of his very own - so I had to order a second one of these.The gift was a huge hit.P.S. Neither recipient is especially interested in chess!
4,Trump revealed,"Slater has done an excellent job of presenting an incredibly complete picture of the mighty ""Donald"". The perspectives shown of the man range from his own truly personal reflections to the opinions of friends and foe, from the conqueror and his minions to the vanquished. A must read for all the ""Apprentice"" lovers in the crowd."
2,"Boring, uncritical, uninsightful","March 13 reviewer Corinne Smith nails it. This is a basically a series or collection of interviews, primarily with fans of ""the Donald"", who have no problems with his oxymoronic concept of ""truthful hyperbole"". Trump is a genius at shameless and shameful self-promotion, with an almost endless ego, but the story told here is flat, uninspiring, unrevealing, and tedious.And the book is simply boring. Did I say boring? It is boring."
1,Nothing new here...,"Donald Trump is one of the most unsympathetic characters in the world, and this book just makes one realize how little most people care for the guy who thinks he has perfected the combover. Sadly, there is absolutely nothing important, interesting, or new here - so buy at your own discretion. Why are these books published anyway?"
2,Stop while you are winning,"I love Omar's older works, not least the two very fine albums Wall of pride and Hard times in the land of plenty. But this album is nowhere near as good. None of the tunes are catchy and the lyrics are filled with blues or Omar clichés. It is all Mississippi, shaking and hoodoo man - a lame reflection of past time greatness. Save you money. If you do not know the older albums mentioned afore buy them instead. My guess is that the positive reviews are written by people connected to the record company or by Omar himself."
4,"A must have for ""Ave Maria""","This is a fine compilation of Josef Locke favorites. Legend has it that none other than the internationally famous Irish tenor John McCormack suggested Locke opt to sing popular music and lighter fare over attempting a career in opera. It should be noted however, that (in this listener's opinion) Locke's version of Bach's ""Ave Maria"" is much more moving than McCormack's (as heard on BMG's ""Ave Maria"" CD). I cannot listen to this recording without welling up with tears. Tender, impassioned and mighty. Locke sings it in a higher key, by the way than does Mario Lanza in his robust version. The rest of this album is made up of many recognizable sentimental favorites and Locke is always charming and effective."
2,Oh dear,"I presume this book was written very soon after the Dahmer trial, as the gaping holes in research are most apparent.There is no mention of Dahmer's childhood double hernia operation, which according to his father, changed him from a happy bubbly child to a withdrawn loner.However, it was interesting to read quotes from former classmates etc.I would recommend Brian Master's book for accuracy, although I found at times he was too sympathetic to Dahmer, which made me cringe to say the least.There are some major untruths in the book. Dahmer was not an animal abuser, as stated, and his love of his pets was ignored.Too much experts ponitificating on their own theories,yawn.I would look to other books for a more truthful account."
3,So-So,"At first the book was very eye-opening but a lot of myths (that Jeff Dahmer even said himself that were not true) are presented as fact and that really ruined certain parts of the book for me. It was written in 1992, right after the trial when not all questions had answers so there are quite a few factual errors here and there in the book. I also wasn't a fan that the author made him out to be a complete monster and only justified where that monstrous behaviour might have come from without actually presenting us Jeff as a person. In my opinion not the best book to read if you don't already know the straight facts about Dahmer."
3,maps?,"The trail descriptions in this book are great. The book may be worth buying for the descriptions alone. But there are only 11 (very) simple line drawing maps for 124 trails and there are no elevation diagrams whatsoever. In fact, you have to search each trail description if you want to find the elevation change. That information could have been displayed in the margin (which is how the author displayed information he thought was important). This book has 124 trails and therefore desperately needs a section classifying the trails in groups such as long, short, scenic, strenuous etc. The only trail classification in the book is with the very long trails. Another thing that should have been included was an overall map showing how the smaller maps relate to a map of northern Georgia. I ordered two other northern Georgia hiking books, which will hopefully fill in the details missing in this one"
3,a picture is worth...,"While it's nice to know that this book covers many miles of trails (532 miles--it's in the preface), it is not very important. I agree with the other reviewers' comments on the ""drawn while waiting for the light to turn green"" maps; they hurt the book. My only other gripe is that, intentionally or not, the book is geared to folks who know where the hike ""areas"" are located. The book is organized by hiking area. I didn't don't know the areas, and so it is that I appreciate the approach in ""50 Hikes in the North Georgia Mountains,"" by Johnny Molloy. His table of contents identifies the city closest to the hike, a big help for me. If, for example, you know the location of the Tray Mountain Area, you won't need to google-map as much as I did to plan my vacation. The two books complement each other."
3,Not what I wanted,"I wanted a more comprehensive book. One that would give me all trails, long or short, in a given area. This book seems to focus on only the longer trails. I should have visited a local book store."
1,Not for Stampede,These steering blocks do not fit the traxxas stampede model. They are too small and the description is misleading because it says they do.
5,a composer from the planet third from the sun.,"yes, this may be a radically different album from steve's other albums, but it is his best in my opinion.it is a masterpiece of subtlety. it is a gorgeous sonic tapestry. it is one of my most favorite albums.at first listening it is repetitive, super soft and slow moving. but listen again, closer, and you beginto hear the shape of a true musician. he evolves the gradual changes here, in a minimalistic way of course,with such suprising beauty. tape loops and anderson's percussion contribute greatly.i don't like other of his albums which are so loud. i think we've got a complex creator here. in any case,this album will truly transport you to landscapes in your mind and heart where peace and beauty reign."
3,"Quiet, sparse, low-key","I've had this on LP since it came out, and it captivated me. This is a quiet album, best listened to with headphones in a quiet environment. The songs unwind like thoughts; it's very unstructured. It's an acoustic guitar and various percussion instruments like rattles and congas. No vocals.The dynamic range of the recording is exceptional.This is more meditative and ambient; not a 'rockin' kind of work at all. It's good background music if you are in a quiet space, but since much of it is subtle and subdued, noise will ruin it."
5,Essential Jazz-Ambient Exploration -- MUST HAVE,"""Northern Song"" was so ahead of its time when it was released in 1982 that it is STILL beyond most of the average music masquerading as ""cross-genre"" or ""ambient."" Tibbetts is perhaps the best unknown guitarist/instrumentalist of the past twenty years. ""Northern Song"" is one of the best examples of spacious, expansive, instensive, unstructured music recorded since 1980."
5,holivintage jr.,"i lost this doll, too. but i got a second chance as i did for the doll above. i call her the ''flame in fushia''. her fushia gown she wears is flaming in beauty! 5 stars from me. five wishes upon five stars!"
3,only good for scratches,"after using this case for a while, I have found that it is only good for keeping scratches off the ipod. The clip doesn't hold very well, and it feels kind of fragile, I'm waiting for it to snap or break any day now. The actual case is not that strong to actually protect the ipod from a drop, rain, accidental sitting, or crash. Of course mine is still in good condition because I take precautions, but the case doesn't give me confidence that it is protecting the ipod, other than keeping scratches off. If you use the ipod in a rough environment I would suggest something else to protect it."
2,It was nice. for 2 days,"The case scratches really easily, and in my case, it scratched on the screen, so videos are now ruined while this case was on, also the back peice left scratches on my ipod."
1,Not legitimate kava,I have had calming effects from taking the now discontinued liquid kava/passiflora/valerian from country life.The Eclectic Institute - Maple Flavored Kava Kavajust left me a little light headed and upset that a company with hundreds of products sold at places like whole foods and amazon.com sells inferior products. At least this one is.
5,Colts!!!!!,Very please with this product. The quality of the jersey is great. Sturdy with stitched numbers and letters. Great fit for stocky built man. Couldn't find this style jersey in stores for the price.
3,Scruffy marine biologist meets society chick,"Brad Smith is a marine biologist on a search for giant squid, despite his wealthy family's disapproval. Parris Hammond is a sometimes-shrewish, slightly spoiled society beauty who eventually falls for him and decides sea life is pretty cool. This is a mostly okay book, nothing spectacular, but with a few funny moments. It beats the previous book in the series, but doesn't measure up to the first one.For another take on the story of the rich girl who matures and falls for a great guy she might once have ignored, definitely check out Cara Colter's ""The Heiress Takes a Husband."""
5,"Jealous of the talent, eh, Krista? This book ROCKS!","If you're a romantic comedy junkie like me, you're not going to be able to resist this great new story by Shirley Jump. It's fun, charming, and completely irresistible, packed with Shirley's unsinkable humor and a strong thread of erotic suspense.If you don't own it, GET it.Heather J., Wyoming"
4,A Charming Musical,"""I Love Melvin"" reunites Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor (from ""Singin' In The Rain""). It is a charming musical. Both Debbie and Donald give wonderful performances. The songs in this movie are wonderful. I especially love ""Where Did You Learn to Dance?"" and ""A Lady Loves"". The number ""I Wanna Wonder"" is a wonderful example of the comedy and virsitility of Donald O'Connor."
1,"Save Your Time And Money, DON'T BUY!!!!!!!","I was really looking forward to watching this movie. It has my favorite actors and I LOVE to watch old movies with dance scenes.But when the movie came I put it in my TV and it didn't work. It said it could not read the disc. I tried it in a my computer too. Same thing. Soooo...I sent it back and bought the same item, thinking the disc I had bought had just been defective. Well, same story over again. Then you have to go through the hassel of returning it and getting a refund. Trust me, this movie is a definate no-no."
2,WTF?,No Dre. Day? No 187?So I guess they like to leave out the best song's from the game.Makes sence...This CD=Flop
2,bad quality sound,"I bought the whole soundtrack just for the bonus Afi song on the second disk, the quality of the sound on the cd was awful, maybe my computer just didnt read it well but it sounded like crappy am radio, waste of my money"
2,where is the rest of it?,"I love the game San Andreas and the music thats in it. Unfortunately the soundtrack is missing way too many good songs from the game. I can list about 10 of them from the top of my head. If you want this soundtrack as a collectors item then cool, get it. If this is something your actually going to listen to because you enjoy the music on the game then I can NOT recomend this soundtrack due to the fact that its missing a lot of songs, and in this case some of the better songs."
5,Best of the best,"Got this product way earlier than I anticipated. Not much to review on account of the fact that i never opened it, but San Andreas is by far my favorite game of all time and the soundtrack in my opinion is the best as well, they have everything. This CD set offers a taste of everything from our 2005 favorite game, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. If you loved the game, this is a must have."
3,needed more info about contents,was hoping for complete sound track but i got the greatest hits cd which did not have any of the songs i wanted
3,Get the box set instead.,This has a few good songs but is missing the best ones from the game. My advice is to save your money and get the box set.
2,Grand Theft Auto: San Andres Soundtrack,"Wow, this has got to be one of my worst cds in in my collection. After hearing the songs from the game while playing and liking most of it, they could'nt of picked worst songs for the mix. Don;t buy this album, it's terrible."
4,"Not bad, not good nether.","This is an ok Cd. It does addcacly as its apposed to, and captures the high lights in music for the game. The problem is that Rockstar and Interscope Records are just tryin' to get a bigger cash flow by adding a dvd to a cd that if you have the game, you've heard just about every song a millon times.The Dvd its self is ok. It shows the events leading up to the game its self. I was a little let down here as I thought its would kinda tie together so plot holes and stuff in the game. But it did nothing of that sort and just ended up being somthing I think they should'a added to the game itself.So all in all,it's a good mix cd, but if you have the game itself this is somthing you might wanna skip."
3,"A bit sloppy, but still a good beginner workout.","I started doing this workout when I first got back into working out. I thought the walking dvds were too easy and wanted something a little more challenging. It gets the job done in 30 minutes - which I liked. What I didn't like is that Leslie was frequently off in her timing. The dvd felt like it was thrown together quickly and they didn't care too much if it was a quality product. Sometimes you have to reshoot. There is one woman in the program who is very distracting.I would recommend this dvd if you are a Leslie fan and want something a bit more strenuous than the walking programs. I no longer do it, but for a while it was in my regular rotation of exercise dvds."
2,A dull Leslie Sansone product,"I have to be critical of this product, since I really love all Leslie's other DVDs. This is slow and boring - and barely attempts to do a ""taebo"" type of exercise. Rather buy a plain walking DVD - much more beneficial."
5,One of my favs,I love this. Leslie changes up her normal walking and adds some cool kickboxing moves. This still uses her signature moves but adds some punches and kicks front and back. This is a great workout and I really love the feel of my ABS and legs on this workout. I would recomend this to ever one who wants a little change to there Leslie workout.
3,Walk Away the Pounds-Walk and Kick,"I thought the moves were easy to follow and I liked doing something different from Leslie's other walking DVD. However, she never tells you how far you've walked."
5,Great Service,I received my item like new and in a very timely manner. I would order from this site again!
1,Highly Disappointed!,"I usually love Leslie's WATP dvd's...but this one was just not good at all. I like to see all of her members dressed alike not just looking like they came in off the street and decided to join in. The setting is not light enough and it doesn't look very spacious. And why are the short people in the back? You can see the little short lady trying to peer around the tall lady in front of her so she can see Leslie. Who's idea was that? And Leslie really needs to do a better job of executing the moves. And finally...for this to be a walk and kick exercise (with emphasis on kick)...I don't think there was enough kicking. She does more kicking in her other DVDs. So yeah, I was not pleased and I know I will not play it again so it gets to sit with my collection of other disappointing DVDs until my next yard sale."
1,Repetitive,The line is much same of other videos--I have 18 of them and it don't pay to add new ones. Maisie
5,Different But Effective,I own several of Leslie's DVD and enjoy the majority of them. This particular one is fun because she bumps it up a little more with the kickboxing and therefore your muscles aren't getting use to the same routine. She doesn't go to the extreme with the kickboxing making it pretty easy to follow along. The walking and kickboxing are done in intervals.
5,Nice Addition to My Collection of Leslie Workouts!,"I am glad I purchased this DVD because it adds variety to my workouts. Leslie has been the only fitness instructor I have worked out with in the past four months and her programs are very, very effective! I'm down 41 pounds (in a little over five months) by eating healthier and rotating her DVDs just about daily. This DVD provides some easy kickboxing moves and is perfect for me at 52 years old! If you're short on time, I highly recommend this DVD. It is only about 30 minutes long and you do work up a sweat!"
2,Not very Kickboxy,This is a workout for people who are scared to try kickboxing. Its very similar to Sansone's 'Walk and Jog' and less of a workout as the kickboxing inserts don't fit smoothly but rather jarrs the workout. Definitely for beginners.
1,Not what I expected,"First let me say, I had no problem with seller but was not happy with work out. I have her original work outs and I guess I was just expecting more. I have just pulled out my original Walk Away the Pounds dvds and use those"
5,another outstanding workout,If you are looking to add a change up to your workout then this is the perfect workout for you. Leslie incorporates her typical walking in with kickboxing moves and she makes it so much fun with her typical enthusiasm and energy which makes you want to keep pushing yourself further. Before you know it you are done with the video. This DVD provides a good stepping stone if you want to do some more kickboxing in other DVDs. It provided a perfect changeup to be able to learn something different. Get it and you won't be disappointed
4,Very Intense & Sweaty,"I just did her 'Walk & Kick' 2 mile kickboxing dvd. I sweat a lot on this one, almost more than in the 5 mile fat burning (which is my fav dvd) Really good thigh/leg workout. Kinda slow but a little more intense than her others. 32 mins for 2 miles, its Leslie & her instructors, including Mary Joe in the dvd."
4,Consider,"I have this on DVD to add to my collection of Leslies workouts. I have found this particuliar workout to be of excellant variety, a little more fun than some of the others, and I think that it offers a sweat in a very minimal amount of time. Ya know, when people rate these workouts I wish they would consider just saying it doesn't suit ""them"" and move on to something that does. Often these reviews are very negative and unyielding, sure ruins it for those at different levels or with different tastes."
5,More variety adds fun,"My most common issue with Leslie's regular Walk Away the Pounds workout is repetition. I get so bored of doing the same four steps over and over. This workout adds some variety with ""kickboxing"" intervals. These aren't nearly as tough as something you'll find in TaeBo or other kickboxing videos...just some kicking, punching, and some bob and weave motions. Leslie doesn't even use proper kickboxing form, although some of the exercisers behind her do. She's more emphasizing that you keep moving. There are four kickboxing intervals and you do the regular WATP steps in between. It goes by really fast because you're doing something new every kickboxing interval. I don't think it's much tougher than her regular workouts, but it is more fun."
2,For the beginners,"I have other tapes from Leslie and I was exited to get this one. That was until I put it on and actually did it. I didn't even get my heart rate up. It last only about 30 mins. so by the time she really gets going, she goes into the cool down. I was very disappointed. If you are just starting an exercise routine, this is perfect. If you are more advanced, don't waste your money."
3,Great book but price stickers ruined it as a gift.,"This book alone would get a five star rating, but price stickers attached were impossible to remove neatly. I bought the book to give as a gift, but it now looks like I bought it at a used book store."
5,Just what I wanted,"I was a little worried to get the cheapest cd, but I figured it was worth a shot. I don't know what the others sound like, but this is the classic, Italian music I was looking for. (It is not just mandolins.....there are other instruments in the music and it's really great.) Don't be scared about the price, the quality is fine."
3,Okay for a beginner who needs basic info regarding training.,"Unfortunately, the paper is of a much higher quality than the information or organization of the book. There is very little information regarding American field trials. The scant info included is primarily about a few midwestern GSP trainers and owners. There is no information regarding NAVHDA field trials. The training book published by NAVHDA is a much better more systematic guide to training a verstile hunting dog such as the GSP.Most of the info on kennels and breeders is focused on show kennels and show dogs. For those readers interested in history of the GSP and current trends in breeding in a much more comprehensive manner, I recommend Der Deutsch-Kurzhaar. It costs 3 times as much but is 20 times better."
5,German Shorthaired Pointers Today,"Great Book! This is what you should know, at the very least, before you go out to buy a German Shorthaired Pup. If your breeder isn't raising the litter this way look elsewhere. This breed is one of the smartest types of dog around. BUT you have to start them early and you can not slack up on them. If you follow the guides in this book it is easy, but Please give your dog these needed encouragements to be ""ALL THAT HE CAN BE"" If you were to follow this book to the letter both you and your dog will be winners.drayegon"
1,Terror,"How do I even begin?Racist, cheesy, dogmatic horror for children with catchy sing-a-long brainwashing techniques.I don't even have words."
5,Sunday School Kids love it,"I have shown this video to kids aged 4-13. They have all loved it and got the message...not to lie, how to forgive. I believe that is the whole point...it is entertaining and it teaches Christian values."
4,In the Best Man's Bed by Catherine Spencer,Description from the book back cover:The scene is set for a wedding in the Caribbean -- until the best man and the maid of honor take an instant dislike to one another! Ethan Beaumont thought he could never trust another woman but his desire for Anne-Marie Barclay cannot be ignored. They decide to keep the peace -- at least until the wedding is over -- and end up making love! Ethan feels their relationship must begin and end in his bed. But Anne-Marie isn't prepared to be just the best man's mistress ...
5,Rare combination of features....,"Been using for 4 weeks now. Only recumbant that has support for laptop computer. I watch DVD's and read email while cycling away. Excellent choice of programs, resistance, duration. Very quiet. Can actually ride quietly in bedroom without awakening partner. Strong construction. Aesthetic appearance. Would definitely recommend ! Quality of gym models."
5,Excellent Movie,"I absolutely love this movie. I recorded it off television on a Scifi channel anime weekend (When they used to do that). Its a great movie and I am glad to have the dvd now. I was overjoyed to see the stuff that the television cut out (Harlock's speech, and the musical parts). The movie came faster then expected in the mail and I was overjoyed."
5,"Open your heart with Rami Shapiro's, Open Secrets.","Open Secrets is a celebration of the unfolding story in everyone. More important than the wisdom shared in Open Secrets, is the depth of understanding shown in the letters. Even after completing Open Secrets, I find myself regularly rereading different sections. The heartfelt messages in this book continually teach me what I need to know on a daily basis. I would highly recommend this book."
4,Tikkun & Tesuvah... the rest is commentary,"In Open Secrets Rabbi Rami Shapiro presents his teachings without the aid of textual exegesis, in the mouth of a fictional rabbi from the last century in Europe. Shapiro covers such topics as Judaism, Who is a Jew, God, Creation, Humanity, Evil, Human Nature, Torah, and so on, running the full gamut modern religious and spiritual topics.Shapiro views all these subjects through a non-dualist, non-theist lens. He has a decidedly simple framework for Judaism. He cleverly calls the heart of Judaism tikkun and teshuvah. Tikkun is helping to repair the world, acting with kindness, love and generosity to people and things; while teshuvah is turning toward God, who is reality itself, and the ground of all being. The rest, as he quotes the famous Hillel quote, is commentary. Shapiro always challenges his readers to be humble, to look at the world from a different framework than traditional monotheism, and to reshape ourselves."
2,Shipping took forever,"The book was great, in good shape - but it took about 3weeks to recieve. If you need your book in an average amount of time- don't order from this vendor."
1,Wrong book,"They sent me an early edition of the book, causing me to be unprepared for class. I did not need this book, I needed the correct one. Very dissatisfied."
3,Average,The book arrived in a timely manner. Its cover was ripped. The pages were marked. None of this affected my use of the book. It may affect my ability to resell the book. I would buy from this seller again.
5,Wonderful Resource!,"After searching for any books on Travel Nursing, I came across this book. The ONLY one!! I am currently in the process of becoming a travel nurse and this is just what I needed! I recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to become a travel nurse. It has really answered many of my questions. It gives you a timeframe of what to do, what all paperwork you need, ways to negotiate with a company, even a thorough list of travel companies and what they offer!! An excellent much-needed resource for the new traveling nurse."
5,A have-to-have book for anyone thinking of travel nursing,Great book. Gives good insight to this adventerous world of travel nursing. I definitely recommend this book.
2,Hitting the Road,There was some helpful advice in this book but I was expecting to get more from reading this book. It was very short and covered things superficially without getting into much depth.
1,Price,I've researched the absurd price on this book on several other websites have it at hundreds of dollars as well. I've never seen anything like it. I'm floored.
3,It's better than most PMG - insipid in places but has some good moments,"This is just a matter of taste, but I have never quite 'got' the PMG. Mostly I find the music very simple and saccharine. I find tracks like 'Phase Dance' unbearable. But there are some excellent tracks here and there, eg. 'Are You Coming with Me?', or 'The Heat of the Day', and Metheny can produce some great soloing.I think the title track is a very good piece of music. It starts atmospherically and has some interesting dynamics throughout. 'September 15th' is above average for PMG. The other tracks are, again, just a bit too twee for my tastes.For those wanting longer pieces with more emotional oomph and musical interest, try Yes's 'Close to the Edge' or Allan Holdsworth's 'The Unmerry-Go-Round'."
3,Sic Transit Gloria,"Oh, how sad. This sounded so so so cool when I first heard it in 1981. I hadn't heard it since. Now it just sounds like a lot of other New Age music. Did I change, or was it never really very exciting?"
2,"I tried, I really tried","I was playing some ultra-hyper Ursula 1000 the other night when my wife said, ""Could you please play something mellow?"" I know I had listened to AFWSFWF before and thought then what I'm about to write now, after having these thoughts confirmed last night.AFWSFWF sounds like a half-baked movie score, I don't know how else to describe it. I don't know what is is about the ""epic' Metheny works. I just don't get them, neither all their supposed ""profundity"" or musical ""briliance."" They bore me. I can't finish them. They take themselves too seriously such that I want to scream, ""Lighten up!"" Ok, wow, so you mixed some Asian-sounding guitar, a steady drumbeat, some somnolent piano respites, Pink Floyd like voices in the background and other ""noise."" Folks, I'm out, nocturnally. Nightie-night, sleep tight."
2,First - listen to the samples,If I had listened to samples before and not just read the reviews - I never would have bought it. That does not mean that you wouldn't like it.
5,TOO MUCH REVERB? NAAAAAAAH!,"Pat said once that this record had too much reverb. Shoot, if you're thinking about reverb during ""It's For You"", or ""...Graca"".... A killin' record."
4,Excellent,"This is still my favorite album, despite several follow-ups that, while progressively more commercial, were also very enjoyable. Two of my favorite pices, ""September 15th"", and ""Its for You"", were featured on the ""Fandango"" soundtrack featuring Kevin Costner and Judd Nelson. In fact, this film was my first exposure to Pat Metheny's music, over 15 years ago. Very soothing, and even haunting at times. This is great music."
5,His usual extra-high quality work,"Pat Metheny has the ability to evoke emotions through music like almost no one else I've heard, particularly through use of non-lyric-singing human voices used as any other musical instruments are in his smooth and quality children's voices are heard faintly in the background and then (briefly) take center stage over a haunting melody that does nothing less than evoke images of the ideal childhood you never felt you had. The music will stay with you long after the CD player is turned off. Fantastic album."
2,there is dose information,"The reviewer who said there is no information about the amount of cinnulin is wrong - - 125mg is printed very clearly at the bottom of the label. However, most studies of cinnulin use 500mg as the daily dose. So you would be taking four of these a day to reach the therapeutic level. That makes these expensive compared to other brands such as Olympian"
2,insufficient information,I would not buy this product because there is no information stating the amount of Cinnulin PF in each capsule.
5,Sliding,"I haven't got around to using this CD yet, but appears to be in perfect shape and sounds like its going to be exactly what I wanted!"
2,Caterwauling + Trite Lyrics = Sad fan.,"I keep hoping that someday I'll get another Horsedrawn Wishes out of Ken Griffin, after buying this I don't have much hope. Perhaps I don't understand this record because I skipped Kid Silver, but I've heard my fair share of tunes and this just sounds like a drunk reeking of a 5 week bender reeling off his teenage sons' angry poetry (and not in a good Waits or Cave way). This album sounds like it was churned from an unpleasant bar band and where it does try to shake things up it remains assaultively eye-rolling. Looks like I'm sticking to Rollerskate Skinny."
4,Great Drum Sticks With One Flaw,"These drum sticks are great! I've had them for about 5 months and they haven't broken yet. There is one problem with it and that's the grip and feel. He feels kind of weird and slippery, and when complicated fills, I sometimes drop them. Regardless, these are some great drumsticks. You have to at least try them."
3,"Too academic, provides direction but not content","I found this book to be focused toward the academics who study the process of business education as opposed to business people looking for practical insight. Much of the book is dedicated to talking about what is wrong with current MBA curriculum which begs the questions, 'If I'm being swayed away from the MDA education as it exists, why do I want to spend 200 pages hearing about what doesn't work?'Overall I did not find this educational but instead found this an overly inflated argument against the current MBA education, which could have been distilled into a magazine article."
3,Just needs a better editor..,"A timely and important topic, I started the book with enthusiasm, but I was quickly put off by the spelling errors, the redundancy of much of material, and the (Kindle version only?) italicized font. When the whole text is in italics what good is the claim, 'Italics added'? A strong editor could have made this book an important, succinct and provoking read."
4,An excellent timely issue,"MBAs today, like the elementary, middle and high schools that lead to them, do not sufficiently focus on building managers. Instead they focus on learning models and theories which build knowledgeable people that do no necessarily practice effective management. This was a great awakening call when it was written. Some of the best business schools in the world have given this issue attention but it is still an important issue to continue improving on today."
5,Shankar's best work,"I've heard almost all of L. Shankar's work, solos as well as work with different styles of music. This cd is what got me completely hooked. Shankar has a tendency to experiment when playing traditional Carnatic ragas. It doesn't always work (espcecially when he sings). This recording is different. He demonstrates his mastery of the violin AND his mastery of Carnatic music. While many listeners have trouble understanding/appreciating Carnatic music, L. Shankar makes it accessible to all. He uses subtle outside influences in his melodies and rhythms that compliment his Carnatic base, making it fantastic for all. The second track in raga Savithri is exceptional. I am a Carnatic/fusion violinist in NYC and this track is hands down the best 25 minutes of music I've ever heard. I've never heard anyone play ragamalika swaras like this. It's something special. Get this album. Let L. Shankar take you for a ride..."
2,Stereotypical,"The trouble with Shankar's music is that it masquerades under the name of Carnatic. It is anything but. The lack of imagination is so plain in his Hemavathi piece. Repeating the same set of chords on different octaves does not constitute a Alapanai. Havin played solo all his life, he has missed the guidance of some of the leading vocalists of his time back in India and that shows in his repetition of notes. He definitely has an unerring control over the instrument but....Also the recording is excellent which is one of the main reasons his CD's sell well."
3,Buy 1 (or 2) sizes up!,"Pros:>This product provides a lot of support>Has a great little hidden pee vent>Looks a lot nicer than the photograph>Works great around the hips and for fitting into jeans>Provides decent back supportCons:>Definitely runs on the small size (I bought a size up, but I wish I'd made that 2)>Despite nice loose rubber lace edges to smooth out the lines, still leaves very noticeable indentation rings right in the middle of the thigh>Distributes tummy above the top resulting in a very noticeable spare tire tummy above the waist (looks extremely odd and noticeable)>Permanent metal garter clasps that can be painfulSum:Probably good if you just want to fit into jeans, but buy at least one size up, and don't even think about wearing under any but the loosest clothing and probably with a jacket."
1,Runs very small,I was hoping to use these underneath my wedding dress but the pants were so tight. They push up any fat you might have so your stomach turns into a large donut. Disappointing and I ended up returning them.
1,True Devotion,I am unable to review this book because it was not sent to my Kindle even though I ordered it. Caution; keep close records of books ordered for Kindle so this does not happen to you.
5,True Devotion,"This book was a great read. My sister is married to a retired Naval officer, so I was able to recognize what my sister went through when her husband was deployed. This was a great book that kept me engaged from beginning to end. I actually didn't put it down until I was done! Write more, Dee!"
5,LOVE her stories,"I've always loved Dee Henderson's stories. This one is no exception. A man in uniform gets me every time (I married one!!). I love that her stories combine faith, romance and a little drama to bring together a couple. Her characters are believable and I can relate to them every time."
3,Romance off balance with Navy SEAL suspense,"Dee Henderson gives an in-depth insight into the lives of the Navy SEALs and their families. I enjoyed the book, but often found myself skimming through the lengthy sections focused only on SEAL operations. As compared to her other books (Danger in the Shadows, The Guardian...) the characters were not as well developed nor was the romance. In general Henderson is a wonderful Inspirational Romance writer, but I would stick to her other books."
4,Good start...,"to a really good series. I LOVE military story lines, and the characters and plot are engaging. Best of all, it's a romance without the main characters falling into bed in the first 3 chapters. It's really nice to be able to read and recommend a clean, but still well-done, romance!"
4,Great story!,"This is a good series, and of this series this book is my favorite! Spies and heroes, friendly foes...its in there!"
4,inspirational,I was happy I got this book because I did not realize all the work and dangerous job our SEAL had to endure.
4,Good rehash of old storyline,"Man dies. Wife is grief-stricken. Best friend wins her over. Old story (Suzanne Bachmann I think), but not a total waste of time. I enjoyed the characters and the story development. Plot is easy to figure out but I will admit, I still wanted to read on. Characters are religious and there are some ""lets refer to the Good Book"" sections that I found tedious, but hey, that's just me. Enjoy the story."
3,"Not bad, but not my taste","I tend to forget that a lot of the kindle free books are heavily Christian-based. Not a problem, but it felt like she was writing for a class and had to get ""x"" number of God mentions in the book. Almost seemed to take away from the story. I tend to like the relationships to go a little further, I don't need juicy details, but would like to get past a one time kiss good night too. The story started off great, but then it was like she had to hurry up and finish it off and things wrapped up too fast after taking so long. And then some of the plot wrap up seemed rushed too. It wasn't believable that the bad guy sudden turned good. Ryan's story seemed to end very abruptly too.It was worth reading, but I put my review out there for others to see what the book is like, not just the story."
5,Great Book with lots of suspense and sweet romance,"I really enjoyed this book. The relationship between Joe and Kelly was very sweet and Dee does a very good job with the suspense within the book as well. I appreciated how the main characters seek God's help along the way, but they also admit their struggles with their Christian walk. Great book!"
4,"Good, but get a new editor","I'm definitely a fan of Dee Henderson books, and this one is a good read, too. My only complaint is twice at least in the first half of the book a comment was made something like ""the tension in the air was palatable"". It's supposed to be palpable. Palatable means something tastes good. I enjoy the story, but such glaring errors like this make it hard to concentrate on it. I hope she's no longer using the same editors as the ones that checked this book."
3,Predictable and Cheesy!,"I really liked the characters in this book. They are true to themselves and to the story. However the book was predictable from the beginning. I liked that the characters were humble enough to call on a higher power, but even that aspect was over-done. I was impressed with the authors use of the Navy Seals and giving these great Americans their deserved recognition. Good story and kudos to the military wives."
4,True Devotion,"This was a good read, good plot, interesting characters and of course a happy ending.Since it deals with Navy Seals, it has some action along with some romance back home.Enjoy!"
2,"CHRISTIAN romance, read the description!","I didn't read the ""inspirational romance"" description, and was thrown off when there were suddenly surprise bible related scenes. Since Rick Santorum started using religion to fight against women's rights, I just have bad feelings associated with religion, and couldn't finish the book. If you are interested in Christian romance, this may be the book for you, but if you are looking for intense physical scenes, you will not find it here. Read the description before buying!"
5,Wonderful story!,"I loved this book so much I went out and bought the other two. Great story and good characters. I love the ""inside look"" into military life, as a lot of my friends are Navy, Coast Guard, and Air Force. Plus, I live in San Diego (where the book is set) so it's neat to read about places I see in real life. Go read it, you'll love it!!"
2,OK,"I liked this book, but it was terrible, honestly. It was sort of mindless to read, and I finished it in a day."
2,Soap opera,Couldn't finish it as it is too transparent. Also I didn't realize there were religious overtones to the book. It was a struggle to get as far as I did.
2,CHRISTIAN FICTION.,"Read book description, editorial reviews and first couple of customer reviews without getting any indication that this book is published by a Christian publisher and has a significant amount of text devoted to God, the Bible and Christian thought. That is fine if it is what you are looking for and bought with that knowledge. Personally, I thought I was getting a typical military/thriller/romance novel and found the Christian slant to be both distracting and detracting to the story. Would never have rented book if I knew."
3,For Obsessives Only,"Why for obsessives only? Who else would prefer 8 Lp's worth of unreleased, rare and live recordings that are almost entirely inferior to the original versions? I don't particularly wish to hear every version of ""Little Wing"" Jimi ever recorded, especially demos that sound like they came off a 1924 dictabelt. This set is strictly a curiosity for the obsessive collector to brood over and try to detect if Jimi has done something they don't know about. Otherwise, just an over-priced, sub-par collection of songs that never sound as good as the original studio versions. Stick with those."
3,"It smokes, but it's hard to keep temps right","Was using a Kingsford Charcoal grill to indirect grill and smoke meats, but that's hard to keep lit because there is no access door, so pushing wood chips thru the grates to keep it going is it.. Bought this to smoke with, and it does smoke well, but there is no vent control. It seems the venting is about perfect to keep it at the ideal temp under perfect conditions. add some wind and stoke the fire a little, and the temp comes up above where it should, but it also cannot be brought back up quick if the temps drop due to needing coal or wood"
1,Poor quality at any price is Still a rip-off.,"Out of the box the grill is missing parts; several screws, nuts, one lower support bracket, the wooden handles have some chips and splinters and a couple of the holes were not drilled completely through. The exterior of the smoke chamber is marred in several places; so I will have to buy some high temp paint to touch up the surface of a brand new grill. I am shocked that the surface isn't pre-cured (maybe the exterior wouldn't be damaged if properly treated before packing and shipping), so know that if you purchase this smoker you have to protect the surface until you've burned charcoal for 2hrs (sufficient to keep the temp in the ideal range which will require adding some dry hardwood chuncks)and then protected the surface until cooled. And like another review the lid doesn't fit, neither the lid nor smoke chamber are round, sort of irregular unmatched ovals. There is just no quality control in the manufacturing nor packing of this grill."
4,Consistant Quality,"What can you say about a singer/songwriter who rocks the house!Buy anything from RWH and you will find many, I repeat many, gems that you'll email to your buddies!That is how these artists get exposure."
4,"Not technical, but a nice tale","If you enjoy Gann's other work, you will like this as well, although it is light on aircraft details (as befitting the title), and illustrated with the same broad brushes of personality for the characters, leaving the reader's imagination to fill in the details. Included are some entertaining apocryphal tales and decent writing. If you haven't read Gann before, try Fate is the Hunter first, it's fantastic."
1,Bottles under filled,"Bottle filled less than half, contacted Amazon, they sent sent another, that too was less then half full. Expect to recieve 40ml for the price of 90."
2,32 led flashlight,"I dont recommend this flashlight, it is a push button to turn it ON. you have to maintain the button pushed so it stays ON. or you can turn the nob at the back to maintain it on, after some use you have to hit it on your hand a couple of times for it to come ON.Magnificent 32 Ultimate LED Flashlight (32 LED)"
5,The joy of accesible poetry!,"This book was given to me as a gift by a cousin. I read it through at one sitting and felt as though I really knew the poet. How remarkable that a person can be gifted enough to record the joy and sorrow, highlights and lowlights, of a lifetime in a way that gives universal meaning to personal experience. A perfect gift!"
5,Another wonderful book by Lurlene McDaniel!,"This is a very touching story of a set of twins, Alexis and Adam Chappel. They have been very close since birth, and when Adam's leukemia relapses, Alexis is devistated. At first Adam doesn't tell his family that the cancer has returned. This book talks about friendship, romance, and the sad truth that sometime or other, we all have to let go.I loved this book, and I hope you do too!"
5,A Story to TOUCH your soul,"This story brings you into the life of two twins, Alexis and Adam, high school seniors.They have common lifes except for a haunting past for Adam. He had leukeima when he was eleven.The twins parents are always at work, and it seems like a divorce is possible. Alot is going on for these busy teenagers and Alexis is so whirled up, she doesn't see the signs.Adam is losing weight. Adam has bruises. Adam is in TROUBLE. With the truth of a relapse sinking into Alexis's brain, life spins out of control.Alexis and her boyfrined split. There are no future signs of recovery in view for Adam. Alexis just wants things to be the same, before Adam ever had cancer. But how can that happen when your brother for eighteen years is hanging on by a finger for life?"
5,A Sad Story,I really like The Time Capsule. Even though it was a sad story it got me caught up in the adventures. I really liked how I could feel how Alexis and Adam felt. I also liked how the boo-boo bears were dedicated in Adam's name even though he had died. I also enjoyed that Lurlene McDaniel had so much discription and that ever page told you soemthing new.
3,a pretty good Spanish guitar album.,"For $1.99, it's a good value. I've bought a lot worse albums, Gypsy, Flamenco, Spanish, etc. This one is pretty good, only 4 songs out of15 I didnt like. But I prefer various artists instead of one.However, why do many tracks here sound the same? ex, #8 is the same as #7, but 1 minute shorter.Amore? Nope, just Spanish guitar."
1,You get what you pay for,This item was cheap and a complete waste of money. It did not do the job and was cheaply made. I could have spent the money on bubble gum and it would have done a better job after i chewed it.
1,Your kidding right?,"Is it possible to rate this rag as less then 1 star??I love this statement from the book: ""I did not win the America's cup. The entire team did"". Bill KochNot for ONE MINUTE did ANYONE think that you, Bill, had ""personally"" won anything! You simply paid the bills so Buddy Melges and Dave Dellenbaugh could!This book discribes Bill Koch as the ""skipper"" of America3. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time!"
2,Too Expensive For What You Get,"Bought for my seven year old, who loves to do crafts and loves butterflies, glitter, etc. I was disappointed by how little there was for the price, though. It's basically a big butterfly, two medium, and three very tiny ones for the barrettes. I know the info said this, but I had it in my head that there were small ones in addition to the tiny barrette ones. Not worth the fifteen bucks."
5,Excellent craft for 5yos,I bought this for my daughter and her friends. She loves any crafts but the girls LOVED this set. It's easy to do and provides a sweet butterfly decoration. I highly recommend it!
5,"proof is in the pudding., a master gardener",I have watched Jack's gardens for over the decades and he is a master. I am so happy to have this book to follow an expert.
3,Okay,It serves its purpose. It is being used for a surgical tubing transport system for frisbees. We are glad it works.
1,Doesn't last,"I bought the 2"" size through Amazon and then realized that I needed the 2 1/2"" instead. So, I bought that one at the local Farm and Home Supply store. I installed it on a new electric motor for our attic fan. Everything fit and worked great - until part of the shoulder of the pulley broke off. So, tomorrow the defective piece goes back to Farm and Home and I'm going down the street to the Tractor Supply Company to buy a Phoenix steel drive pulley (about three times the cost, but I'll bet it doesn't shatter after about a month's actual use). Getting access to the attic fan is enough of a pain that it will be worth it to use something reliable.If you like to make a hobby of maintaining your equipment, go cheap and buy the Chicago Die Casting model. If you want to just use your stuff, look elsewhere."
5,Master Work by A Master Writer,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Harry Middleton is one of those great writers few have heard of. His books are moving and inspirational. Rivers Of Memory, one of Middleton's last books, is full of wonderful warm tales of the outdoor life. If you liked ""A River Runs Through It"" you will also love this book. Few were published and now it is long out of print. It is very rare. I asked the publisher if it would ever be published again and they said not for a long, long time. I seen copies of this book go for[money]. Buy and read this book."
1,Worthless,"Don't bother with this ""instructional"" video. It is worthless and the package directions are sufficient. Plus the video has this phoney ""actress"" scenerio of ""Oh my I feel so much better,"" blah, blah, blah."
1,Who edited this book?,"So far, after 1 chapter I noticed a couple of misprints. I've been reading Sybex books for many years and this one is disappointing with regard to the quality of editng. Not the caliber of book I expect from Sybex. Especially, when it is dealing with Exam prep."
4,This book was easy to read.,The layout of this book made it easy to reference back to subjects you might need to brush up on.I used this book and passed this exam the first time.
2,don't wash them!,These are wearing out after just a few washes! Not worth the money whatsoever. Not sure why that is...they seemed great at first
4,DirecTV junkie!,"This package arrived in a timely manner, packaging less than perfect. I have used this dish for awhile now with no problems. Over all, I am very pleased with the product."
4,informative essays on Weber and Islam,"This is an informative set of essays by scholars who might be described as ""Orientalists"" or ""neo-Orientalists"" on Weber and Islam, bringing useful balance to Bryan Turner's 1974 work. Almost half of the book is taken up by Huff's introductory essay and Schlucter's essay ""Hindrances to Modernity: Max Weber and Islam."" The remaining contributions tend to be relatively brief. Crone on law and the rise of capitalism is among the better; several essays (Peters, Metcalf, and Cook) touch on the presence or absence of dissenting movements within Islam that might or might not play a role similar to that ascribed by Weber to Calvinism in the rise of capitalism in Western Europe."
5,It's mostly about the dog,"This book clearly states that hearing assistance dogs are born, not made. Then the author gives guidelines for selecting the right dog. She defines characteristics of the breed classes and the breed combinations that are likely to yield the desired behaviors. She describes testing procedures she uses to evaluate dogs in shelters. It's a tremendously useful book. NONE of the other materials I have found addresses so well the selection of a hearing assistance dog. The author also gives a complete set of instructions for step by step training.The book may be out of print, which would explain the high price."
5,WOW!,"This is an awesome cookbook! Having recently traveled to NY and getting to experience Serendipity first hand (where my hubby said the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was worth the trip alone) I returned home and decided to get the cookbook. I was not disappointed in the slightest! I made the carrot cake and cheesecake recipes for my friend's birthday, and all the guests raved. Everyone said it was the best they had ever had, and my ""non sweet eating"" friends went back for seconds! I can't wait to try the rest of the recipes!"
4,Each page brings a smile..share one with a friend!!,Chrisena Coleman's book is a funny look at friendships from Childhood on and is a great read. Each vignette brings a smile to your face..and gives you the urge to call a friend! Whether or not you can relate to each story shared you'll enjoy the celebration of the magic of true friendships. This is a book for friends of all colors... one read it and pass it on to a friend!!
4,Absolutely hilarious - at about 2 am.,"Those Who Hunt Elves is not for everyone. This is extremely obvious from the first moment it appears on the screen, but I thought I'd like to make that clear for those who haven't seen it. However. For people who want to watch something that gives up characterization and plotline for gags and goofball humor, I would really highly recommend this series. I've only seen as far as this volume so far, but I'm eagerly waiting until I can get volume 4.I would like to note, though, that I very much prefer the subtitled version of this series. It has some of my absolute favorite voice actors from different anime series - such as Tomizawa Michie (Sailor Mars from Sailor Moon) as Airi, Mitsuishi Kotono (Sailor Moon from...well...duh) as Celcia, and Seki Tomokazu (Chichiri from Fushigi Yuugi) as Junpei. This series is quite a treat, if you just want to giggle."
3,Memory Palace,"A must-have for anyone interested in the late Billy Mackenzie's music. Not remotely different in style from his last solo cd ""Beyond The Sun"", so if you like that album, this shouldn't disappoint."
1,The Phantom Poster,"I have the privilege of being the advisor to a school Anime club, and I thought I would purchase a poster as a gift to commemorate the inauguration of the club at our school. I was pleased to find a suitable poster on Amazon and ordered it. Now, many weeks later, the club has yet to receive the poster even after assurances from the vendor that not only was it sent, but another was sent to replace the first one lost in shipping. As a result, the club will be wrapping up the school year without the promised poster. This is the first true disappointment I have suffered in purchasing anything through Amazon. I understand that Amazon was not responsible for the shipping, but my confidence in receiving purchases through Amazon had been diminished."
2,not that great,"the only reason i gave this game 2 stars is because of the cool graphics. the reason i don't like this game is beacause of all the dungeons, they take up the whole game. and they are way, way to long. And you have to repair your weapon with weapon powder constantly which takes to much of your time and way to much of your money. And since you are more then one charcter you also have to pay the price of reapair powder for the other chacter"
2,Worst game I've ever played.,"A lot of people are going to disagree, and that's fine. This is simply my opinion, based on 40+ hours of game play.This game is horrible. The first few hours are awesome, and you'll think it's fun. That charm soon vanishes, and all you're left with is a boring, older, duller version of Kingdom Hearts - as far as gameplay goes anyways.Throw in some cheap watered down version of Sim City, and there you go. Oh, and the building of towns...yeah, mind numbingly boring.Everybody says this is like Zelda for PS2? I say they must be smokin something awesome, because this is nowhere near Zelda.Don't buy into the hype, it's false, and you'll waste money."
2,Are you serious??!!,"Oh ick!! Did everyone who wrote a good review for this game forget to mention that you have to survive the game on only 32 HP?? the only way to increase that is to find an item that is less then easy. Theres almost too much to this game, I can see why people spend over 100 hours on this game, Im only 3 1/2 hours in and im already exsausted by the nonsense. Pee-U."
1,Of Games and Cancer,"I did not enjoy playing this game. The main reason is that when i was playing this game i was told that a growth on my left atrium was cancerous. After that i couldn't pay any attention to the plot or story, and whenever i turn this game on it makes me remember the radiation therapy. If you have cancer... don't buy this game."
1,Ugh!,"I expected this game to be a fitting sequel to Dark Cloud which was repetitive but fun overall but it isn't It's just repetitive. The graphics look amazing but that's the only plus. It does use the same dungeon crawler style but the enemies are downright pathetic, you're weilding a wrench as a weapon, not a sword and you pretty much die the moment you get hit. I played for five minutes then put it back into the case. That was months ago. Haven't touched it since. Can't believe I wasted 30 bucks on this. don't buy."
5,GOOD GAME,"This game beats out any other RPG. You can customize your weapons, ridepod (a giant robot), and you can bulid villages, too. The first one .... but the sequel undoubtably redeemed the Dark Cloud name. This is a instant classic. Dark Cloud 2 will satisfy ANY gamer"
1,A broken game,"I got the game with a flawless disc yet I still had nothing but freezing, glitching and even failure to read. How anyone would market such a dysfunctional product is beyond me. Gameplay it's self was great, but when your experience is 85% hang ups, freezes and glitches, it's just not worth it.Save your money and get the first Dark Cloud. It's a better game anyway."
5,Great old game,"My son just graduated from high school, and what grad present did he ask for?You guessed it!Someone pilfered his copy of Dark Cloud 2 a few years ago and he begged me to find another copy.He is as happy as a clam with his new/old game.Great fun!"
2,i want it,i really want this game beacuse the first one was my all timem favorite game and i heard that there will be a new special feature besides georma and geomra was fffffuuuuuunnnnnnn
4,Great Game,"This game is totally awesome you can make stuff with the right items of course. The garme is alot better than its predecessor in some ways your weapons brake but they don't dissapear, when you get thirsty you can't heal instead of taking life points of and that only happens like ten times only in the whole game the cons are that you have buy items to make the stuff for building the town and that sometimes its way too hard to level up. Another good thing is well its not good its great that you know what to do to build up a weapon but building up when its reaching its final forms it gets frustrating building up. All in all its a great game with a few cons but every game has at least one bad thing right."
5,Well rounded action-RPG,Dark Cloud 2 will get you ready for Kingdom Hearts! The game mechanics and quality are very similar.
3,thought it would be better,this game is very addicting and fun to start out with. but after a while it starts becoming very repetitious. if you buy this game at least you'll have fun at the beginning of it. i wouldn't believe all of the reviews you read.
4,Wonderful Service,The game was shipped as described. Was in perfect working condition and included guide book (which was a bit used but still readable) I would use this seller again.
2,Too hard with no directions,"I started this game today and I loved the first game when it was new, but this one just isn't up to par. There's no way to dodge anything. Try jumping to the side of a rolling turtle and it follows you. Same goes for fireballs, both of which are just stupidly unbelievable. I've died at least 7 times on just the third level of the first dungeon, because of fireballs. You also can't block fireballs and even if you do block other things they cause half damage.Also, when I first turned on the game, I was thrown into a battle against 5 or 6 robots and just told the button commands. That's incredibly hard to do right out the gate. I died the first time just trying to get used to the controls."
5,"exelent,","I bought a pair of these glasses to use when I play tennis, loanes them to my son, and cant get them back, we both love them, so am purchasing more."
4,tire pressure,"I am happy I got this device. It is very useful, specially now that new cars have alarms when tires are underinflated."
4,Tough and Fairly Accurate,Product is fully stainless steel except the measurement shaft which is plastic. The valve extension is useful for hard to reach position. Ensure valve and gauge have proper & tight seal when measuring. I am glad that measurements were fairly accurate as compared to a digital gauge. Allow about 5 psi to drop (through pressure/air loss) for each measurement each time. This gauge is value for money.
1,Not Accurate,Depending on the speed you push the guage onto the valve stem you will get readings that vary as much as 5 PSI. On my sons Pontiac G5 if I slowly apply the guage I get a reading of 34 PSI and if I push it on quickly I get 39-40 PSI......JUNK! I purchased several and they all behave the same way.
4,just what it says,"i was tired of cheap tire gauges falling apart in my pocket, this is all metal, not plastic, it feels solid and it has a good angle to the pressure head.i did notice a little wiggle in the readouc stick that i didnt like too much, maybe a loose seal or grommet or maybe part of the design to keep it from breaking, not sure, it could be intentional.anyho0w, i carry this arround in my Maxpedition Fatty EDC, along with the bonus valve extensions that come with it, I really do like this product and if you are looking to buy a tire gauge, i dont know why anyone would buy anything cheaper than Slime."
2,Hard to read & off by 2 pounds always compared to a digital,"Hard to read & off by 2 pounds always compared to a digital----The notches on the ruler-like read out are hard to read as are by 2's (32 34 36...)and it is consistently HIGH by 2 pounds compared to a digital that I trust more. So calibrate it to a digital, and remember the correction factor."
2,Love sesame seeds; yet this leaves a lot to be desired,"This is one of three Mrs. May's 2-ounce snacks that I've had. Even though I love sesame seeds, this flavor/variety really was disappointing. It almost tastes stale - or at least lacks flavor. I'd recommend Mrs. May's pumpkin seed or blueberry; but not the white sesame crunch.It is great to be able to buy the 2 ounce sizes for these snacks. Really wish Mrs. May's would sell a variety pack of 2 ounce packages."
1,worst book on the subject-skip it,This is worthless book. I'm astonished that Sams published it! You won't learn anything from this book. I think it is partly Sams Pub fault... they should have assigned a content editor to the author and apparently they did not.Don't waste your money... Praise the Lord I borrowed this book from the public library!
3,ENJOYABLE READING,"This book is a collection of twelve short stories. I liked this because it allowed me to fit into my busy schedule time to read a ""new"" book each day."
1,"Horrible, Completely different than the picture!","This pack is horrible for use in the classroom! The ""people"" are so small, they can fit 2 people on a single sheet of computer paper. The faces are made of tissue thin paper and the ""sticky shapes"" look like the trash from the bottom of the factory floor. I will not be purchasing any items from this company again. The quality was horrible and the false advertisement has caused me to have to rush around getting a replacement craft together to replace this kit. Giving this product was star was being nice, if I could have given it 0 stars it would be better!"
1,Not educational,"It doesn't really teach any tricks.... it's just the guys in the video playing with their yo-yo's for 45 minutes. Boring. Defintely not a good ""how to"" video - and it's not entertaining either."
1,worked for a week,i ordered this cable a few weeks ago and read the reviews and thought this would be pretty good since its around $5 and not $2 so it should be pretty descent. I receive the item at a pretty good rate. I was happy to see this cable looked almost exactly like the apple cable. after 1 week of barely touching it only on nights to charge my phone it dies. i realized the apple connector piece was loose and moved the cable around a little. I hear a small crinkling noise and realize the wires came out of the sockets and knew i couldn't repair this. so i give the cable a light tug and bam the cord disconnects from the connector in no time. i have a feeling the other reviews had or are going to have the same problem i did. Please look somewhere else.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,Broke TWO days after I received it. Both end pulled out and wire broke.Not put together very well at all.I now know why it was so inexpensive on here -- YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!
1,Don't even survive one use,"I bought 3 of these, and every single one stopped working after the first use. They don't fit into the iPhone4 OR my iPad2 correctly, they are too snug, which I think is what breaks them when they're taken out. My husband used one too, and same problem. Definately not worth the money."
1,This was not apple.,"I ordered this as a replacement for my fiance for christmas. We tried using it, and it did not even work. It was in a small unmarked wholesale-looking bag, and was most definitely NOT an apple product. I did pay 99 cents for it, but that it still false advertising. I am very disappointed."
3,2 out of 3 worked,"2 out of 3 worked, that's a ""D."" One of the cables was not reliable. I had to keep jiggling it to make it work. Then it just stopped working altogether."
2,Broken.,"About a week into use, my laptop would not ""recognize"" the cord. I used others to see if the computer was the problem but it wasn't. Maybe I was just unlucky."
5,oh yeah,"does just what its supposed to do. sturdy build, and doesn't feel cheap at all. Cat snacks and wizards. Butt."
3,acceptable,"fit is a little tight. ive had problems charging with apple wall adapters. usb syc works fine. quality of the product is not high, which is to be expected for the price, but has held up thus far. photo is misleading. device is made out of some seriously cheap plastic"
5,Works Fine,Does just what it's supposed to do. Apple brand or not it charges and syncs and that's all I want.
4,works like it should,"what else can I say besides it charges my ipod, and it syncs my media...and does it all for cheaper than the apple adapter."
1,Didn't event fit my ipod!!,This cord didn't fit my ipod touch which is on the old charger. This cable cord looked like the old charger but was too big for the ipod. It was a waste of money.
3,I expected more....,"I bought this system for my bedroom. I wanted something with good sound and small.The good part: nicely built, lots of connectors, good looks.The bad: sound quality is good but not fantastic (far from it!). For $700 you could assemble a much better sounding system. Of course it would be bulkier and not so sleek. But still, bearing the Denon brand I expected more than what I got.Some reviewers are suggesting that you attach a subwoofer and I might try that."
5,Works with Verizon Fios.,"Works perfectly to replace dead Verizon Fios back-up battery. Also you should check your battery and ensure that it is plugged in. It sounds kind of silly right, how could it be out, well the plug isn't very good it doesn't ""clip"" or ""snap"" it simply slides in and is very prone to sliding out. Just a tip to check before you order a new Battery, but if it is the battery it works perfectly."
1,WORST I HAVE EVER OWNED,"I will never buy an Interstate battery again. I have one in a Ranger and my partner has one in her Impala. Mine is 6 months old, hers is 1 1/2 yrs old and if we don't drive our vehicle for a weekthe battery goes completely deed. Worst battery I have ever had, and I have had several in my 62 years of life. They are definitely over priced too."
2,I don't see the dimensions of the battery,I want to buy 2 batteries for my tennis machine but I could not find the dimensions of the battery and I can't tell it fits or not. This vendor seems not doing detail job so I could not buy the battery at first place.
5,Works in Alarm System,"I used this to replace the backup battery of my alarm system. My alarm system company wanted $70 for a service visit plus $40 for the battery. This battery is the same brand that they use and is as easy to change as the AA battery in your typical flashlight. It charged quickly and has worked perfectly since installation. As for those who are reporting problems with other sellers, I ordered mine from a company called Cream City Hobbies and the battery was Interstate, exactly as described. I no longer see them listed as an Amazon seller and cant vouch for the other sellers listed."
3,"wow, matell is realllly cheap","steven? don't you mean black ken? its great that you are adding ethnic barbies, but can't you make new clothes for a new doll and not use poor ken's outfit?"
4,Excellent lens.,the SONY 75-300mm Telephoto lens is well and will provide exceptional performance. The lens is easy to use. The initial results are great. I am pleased with the product
3,Solid performer,"This repackaging of the Konica-Minolta 75-300 is a solid performer, at a reasonably good price. If you like to stay with the camera manufacturer's own products, then you'll not be disappointed. Packaging includes the front & rear caps; lens shade & 1 year warranty.Keeping in mind that the KM lenses came out well before any digital SLRs from that brand, you might want to check out the Tamron 70-300 LD Di zoom. It's a new optic that's ""Digitally Integrated"", has a 1:2 close-up mode, ""Low Dispersion"" glass, and a six year warranty.Additionally, you might look around for one of the Konica-Minolta lenses at a discount."
3,"Average lens for an average price, Good as a starter lens","Nice starter lens to get long ranges but does not perform well in lower light, as it was not designed to. I got this with the ALpha 200 kit for an extra $100 and it was worth that for sure, but if you are spending $200 or more, I would go with a walkaround lens 28mm to 300mm, you'll use it more and can usually find something decent for around $300.If you are getting as an add on and are on a budget, this is a great lens and will fit lots of situations."
4,"great lens, but slow AF in low light","This is only telephoto lens I have, so I can't compare it to anything. The thing I noticed is that autofocus in low light is very slow (1-2 seconds, sometimes even more), and sometimes it doesn't even manage to get a focus. The good thing is that is has pretty large manual focusing ring, which is easy to use, much better (wider and much more to rotate) than on standard 18-70 that came with Sony camera kit.In good lighting conditions it focuses almost as fast as 18-70."
3,OK lens when you are not shooting in direct sunlight,"I've been having an unexpected problem with a lot purple fringing with this lens. I live in Arizona where the sun is very intense. I plan on trying to shoot with a filter to see if that will solve the problem.The photo of the horses mane on wikipedia (key word: Purple fringing) shows exactly what has been happening to some of my photographs.Otherwise, I have gotten some really great shots with this lens."
5,"Great lens, great price",The lens arrived quickly and in perfect condition. This product is of excellent quality. The entire purchase process was easy and efficient and the price beat the competition by a large amount. I'm very satisfied with the product and the distributor. I'm looking forward to using this lens in Antarctica.
3,Good lens.... at 70mm,A good lens at 70mm but has color fringing and chromatic aberration...getting worse as you zoom further.Ok for the price.
4,Compact Telephoto,"The lens does what it is sold to do. It was priced right, and it came quickly for a vacation photo shoot. The quality of photos were good, and the clarity excellent. The only issue is that it did not come with a case for protection. I am pleased with the product and the fact that is does what is said in the media to do."
3,FIRST IMPRESSIONS-Save up and get a better lens. 3 1/2 STARS,"I could not figure out what other reviewers meant by "" a good beginners "" lens and still not sure. I thought either the lens produces acceptable images or not, right? Anyway I purchased the lens thinking, for the price a 300mm lens, this is a good deal, however I am a bit disappointed with the quality of the images from this lens. I am using it on a NEX5 n with the standard adapter. There seems to be a good bit of purple fringing throughout the range and not as sharpe as one may expect. Perhaps I was expecting too much?. The lens is still new to me so consider that too. I'll update if my opinion changes but for now I feel that I should have saved up to get a better quality telephoto lens."
4,Works good,"I don't really know what to say here. I've only used it once, shooting a wedding with a friend. It did well.As far as ordering through Amazon it was here promptly, as usual, and I've had no problems mechanically."
5,Lens,I ordered the lens on Monday and it arrived on Thursday! I was very happy with how prompt the seller responded. The lens is all I expected.
1,Listing mount type would have helped,"It was a beautiful lens, but the mount type was not listed. It was an A mount and I needed an E mount.Nowhere in the ad did I see it list the mount type. So back it went. The return went very smoothly !Thanks"
5,Single Grooved Pulley,"Single V Grooved Pulley, 5/8"" x 7""I Order'ed two of these From BIC,Superstore. Recived on time and just as described."
1,Cassette player is a dud!,"I ordered this cassette player for my 6 year old so she could listen to books on tape. The player worked great for the first 2 days and served its purpose well, until we could not get it to turn off. When you hit the stop button, it continues to run, whether there is a tape inserted or not. The only way to get it to stop is to take the batteries out each time you want to turn it off. I could not find my invoice from shipping which is why I have not returned it, otherwise I would have. I am quite disappointed in this product."
1,Confusing portable cassette player,"The GPX WR30045P Cassette player is confusing! It's imprinted with ""DC in 4.5 volts"" but takes 2 - 1.5 volt batteries! Doesn't compute. And what do I set my AC adapter for? Can't see the tape; bulkier than it needs to be."
2,Cheap Product,"The price was low, but I figured that by now all cassette tape players would be. However, it seems the low price coincides with the product. The player drags the tape and the volume fluctuates from very hight to very low on its own accord. It does play tapes, but when and how it wants to...."
1,sucky! sucky!,"I bought this thing from AMAZON. I threw it in the trash I think 2-3 weeks later. The unit has wow & flutter. The volume increased by itself, I had to keep turning it down! Finally, it stopped working (cassette) just before I began my bike ride home. I just took the batteries out and threw it in the trash. The light was good enough to find my stash in the dark if I got down on my knees. Wasted $40.00's"
2,Not Suitable for School-Too Small,I ordered this backpack for my daughter who will be in kindergarten soon. This backpack is very small! It will not hold any normal size notebooks. It is better suited as a pretend play packback.
4,No More Fingerprints!,I prefer using a stylus to having finger prints on my screen (Kindle Fire). Sometimes it doesn't work. Most of the time it does a great job. I would buy another when/if this one wears out.
3,Functional; wish it have a sharper tip,"I bought it to go with my iPad to avoid finger print on the screen, and also for entering.The tip is a good material. It is functional for drawing and even writing. I used it for also Chinese character input, and it did a good job. However, I wish the tip is sharper so I can use it to enter hand writing notes.On the top, the design has a little knot that can be inserted into the iPad headphone input. That keeps it stay with the iPad. Otherwise it can get lost after a while."
5,Price vs. Value,"I had earlier purchased one of the lower cost stylus pens thinking that there really could not be that much difference. I now know that was an incorrect assumption. The lower cost stylus looked just like the higher priced ones and feels much the same, but the rubber tip would constantly stick to the screen forcing a selection when I was trying to scroll. The BoxWave stylus has a soft flexible tip that easily slides across the screen allowing me to scroll through any of the many lists without inadvertently selecting items. Avoiding the hassle of having to regularly jump out of a popped application or go back and redo a list item selection is definitely worth spending a couple of dollars more for this stylus."
5,BoxWave Kindle Fire Stylus,Stylus fits comfortably in your hand. Bright color makes it easy to find. Extremely durable. I purchased extra to give as gifts!!
3,Pen,It was a cery pricie for what it does. I got it because it matched the color of the Kindle purchased for mhy wife
1,Disappointed,I bought this stylus for my Kindle Fire HD. Not only does the tip not glide smoothly over the screen but but I ordered red and it's definitely pink. I'm very disappointed but luckily it works on my mom's phone and she can use it.
4,good product,"wish it had a way to attach to case or kindle, is easy for kids to loose or misplace, we were able to jimmy rig but not perfect"
2,Paint comes off on your hand,"I got this for my wife, so I bought a more expensive one believing it would be an upgrade over the other offers. I got her Crimson Red as it looked the best from the photo. When we received it, the first thing we noticed is that it was pink, not red as the image and name led us to believe. It was written as Crimson Red, but in real life, it looks more like hot pink. To make matters worse, my wife noticed that the paint started staining her fingers pink. So, for substantially more money, we got a stylus that was the wrong color and the paint comes off on your hand.However, we gave it two stars as it works great. As a pure stylus, it gets the job done."
2,cheap,"I got this for my Kindle Fire and on that it works pretty well. The color I got was not red, it's a dark hot pink color. The end that fits into the headphone jack popped right off when I took it out of the package. It feels really cheap, but for now it will work. It does not work on my touch screen phone. I would not buy again."
5,Just right!,This stylus works great with my Kindle Fire. It helps me to manuever my carasoul and application games easily. The red one I bought also matches perfectly with my cover.
2,BOXWAVE FIRE STYLUS,THIS STYLUS WORKS BUT THE COLOR IS NOT CRIMSON RED OR EVEN WHAT IS PICTURED. THE COLOR IS MORE OF A BRIGHT PINK. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DOESN'T GO WITH MY RED COVER AT ALL. I ORDERED ANOTHER FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY.
4,Best Stylus Yet,"The red, brushed metallic color goes great with the red Deft Dante rotating case for my kindle fire. The rubber nib is softer than any stylus I've found and is read the best by my kf. It is very light weight as a whole. This is the second BoxWave I've bought. The reviews for other stylus' talked about the insert for the headphone jack and was one reason I bought this model. The insert is plastic and pops in and out easily. My second insert is smashed flat on one side, but still works. I can always use the side clip too."
4,Kindle Fire stylus,I wanted something to make typing more accurate. Even to help with moving things on the screen. My finger worked ok but there were times when I would miss whatever it was I was trying to do. It made typing very frustrating. Then I saw this stylus on Amazon's site and I knew that it was what I needed. So I ordered it and have not been sorry. It has made my use of my Kindle Fire much more enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who owns any tablet.
3,BoxWave Stylus,"The stylus fits the purpose. I am not that crazy about the string holder (name) kind of cheesy, not sure how long it will last."
3,Stylus not needed,"Nothing wrong with the product, it looks good, is made well and works well...it just isn't needed for a paperwhite."
4,Does the job,less expensive than the one Amazon is always recommending and works fine for me. I find I need one since my fingers arent as nimble as they once rare
3,Okay. Bad remastering.,"The songs on this album are good. Unfortuneatly, I learned that the remastering left something to be desired in the mid-range of most of the album. I do not own a copy of the original, however, I would purchase that instead."
4,Shaping of a new sound,"The Cocteau Twins' definitely developed their early ""darker"" sound on this album. _Head Over Heels_ proves much more musicly interesting than Garlands, even with its abundance of reverb and drum machine effects. A true die hard fan would find the ""Head Over Heels / Sunburst and Snowblind"" Import EP due to it's four extra tracks. (Including the incredible track ""Hitherto"")"
5,AMAZING,"I rarely give 5 stars, but Head Over Heels deserves it. It's difficult to believe it's from 1983. Ambient, yet doesn't float away; ominous, and yet comforting. I really think this is a perfect disc. Goes splendidly with adolescent angst or break-ups or hanging on the rim of the abyss or similar emotional extremes."
2,"Dense, Dry, Unclear","While this text may offer some unique insight into the analysis of psychological data, the text suffers from severe limitations. Concepts are not clearly explained, the author's statistical notation deviates wildly from standard notation, and the chapters do not flow well from one to another. In my opinion as a graduate student in the social sciences, this is one text to pass over."
4,it's really neat!,"everything about this toys is sssssoooo cool!!! except one thing the screens are made of cardboard when they lead on to make it look like cloth...i also would'nt have as much of a problem with it but the cardboard, or mine atleast does'nt even with the rectangle!!! other wise it is really neat the boom box even opens on the top and you can put little cd's in!!"
4,a so large choice for playing,"i really love this playset, not only cause it is very sweet with its colors and cute furnitures, but also cause it allow dolls to have in the same time, a place for tchatting, a place for making beauty and because it is really usefull to complete Chelsea getting ready doll furnitures :-)"
3,Dominic,I personally did not care for this author's writing style. I found the premise doubtful and the characters without color or believaability.
4,Good book,It's a good book but seems to just go on & on in some places. Vale was a good character but the book seems to talk more of his gambling addiction. (Very annoying)
1,Extremely poor,"Apparently aimed at very small children and the simple-minded, adults may decide that the best aspect of this kiddie flick is the clamshell box with its dual image ""Goodtimes Home Video."""
4,Works Well for Hair,After taking the MSM for six weeks I am fairly impressed with the product. My hair seems thicker and stronger while my skin is improving overall.
4,Best MSM for joints,"I don't know if it really works or not, but after having put my body through 20+ years of abuse, my joints (knees) are still holding out."
3,not that funny,"Lorena Alvarez is the star of this movie, she's ok to look at , but she's not that funny. It has english subtitles. The plot is really dumb, but it's less than 90 mins. There are a couple of ironic twists in end. There's one funny scene,at the end of the movie. I don't know what country it takes place in. Lorena Alvarez should be in a novela instead."
4,Beauty in strange places,"I ran across several of these ""Scenes"" in, of all places, the silly 80's movie ""My Chauffeur"". Believe it or not, the pieces were well placed. Of obvious high quality, they stood out enough for me to write down the artist in the credits. Since the pieces were titled Scenes, I figured they were made for the movie, which seemed very strange given their quality.Upon doing a search on Amazon, I was pleasantly surprised to find not only the artist, but an album comprised of the ""Scenes"". Another reviewer was very correct in saying these pieces are similar in style to Phillip Glass. I have to admit that I am NOT generally a fan of violins, but this album transcends my prejudices. Speaking of prejudices, don't let my mention of this music's inclusion in a silly 80's movie taint your view. This music is exquisite!"
4,Insightful,"This was an interesting read. I liked it because it changed what I thought about India's and Japan's space programs, and because it was quick to read through. The inclusion of payload masses and engine specifications was useful to me.It also appears to be thoroughly comprehensive in its cataloging of orbital launches (successes and failures) through 1999 (minus perhaps one from Japan). It also mentions sounding rockets developed and used.One curious omission is any discussion of India's military or defense goals with its space program. Perhaps there really are none, but the book describes tensions between the US and India over KVD-1 engine sales from Russia, suggesting to me that there is more of a story here than is told.The limited budget information provided is insightful.Certain sections are redundant and perhaps poorly written, but other than that, it wasn't bad."
4,Amazing album,"Illogic is one of the best lyricists around and one of the most slept on and underrated. Lyrcially this is easily 5 stars. Just listen to '1,000 Whispers' if you need proof. Production wise, I wish it could have been a little better but it does fit his style for the most part. Very good concepts. A must have IMO."
3,I Wish I Could Like This....,"Illogic has a decent flow but I can't get into his music for the same reason I don't like Aesop Rock. I can forgive an emcee who makes sense most of the time, I can't forgive an emcee who rarely makes sense to make himself sound ""deep"". Sometimes he'll say stuff and you'll be like wow that's tight but right after he'll say something where you'll wonder what planet he's from."
5,Simple and beautiful.,"Wished that it had a lobster clasp. This would make it easier to put on, but beautiful pendant. If you are going to wear it often you might get the chain soddered to pendant. 2 rings hold chain on to pendant."
4,jouirney horshoe pendant,"The product arrived as described but was a little smaller than you you would think , maybe a better description or a picture with a ruler in the background would serve the buyer better.That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.Yellow gold may play more on the diamonds and give it a little more sparkle.Other than that it is nice and with the price of gold these days it is worth it in my opinion."
2,Pictures are deceiving,"The item is nice, but a lot smaller and not as nice as it looks in the picture. Not worth the money"
5,Chapter Zero the best,"If you have read any of Fred Gallagher's recent comics, you may find them good, but slightly boring. Well, chapter zero, when Rodney Caston was still co-writing was, in my humble opinion, the best of the comics. It may be a thin book, but it's worth its weight in gold."
4,"""Hopping"" funny","From the looks of the cover, it looks like it has the episode where Granny finds a kangaroo that escaped from the zoo. She sees the kangaroo, thinking it's a giant jackrabbit, and goes to tell Jed. But by the time he gets there, it's run away, so he thinks Granny is crazy."
5,Satisfied customer,"""I love it!! and just in time for valentine's day! The attachment makes all the difference. Without the attachment it doesn't do much for me. The gee whiz is smooth and feels great against your delicate bits, particularly the nubby head. It also (pleasant surprise!) picks up your body heat making it feel somewhat ""lifelike"". Very satisfying."""
3,gee whiz,"i was so excited to get the gee whiz... but once i got it and had a chance to use it i was kind of disappointed. i got the clear and green model which may not be as curved as the blue one, any way it tends to fall out when it's at any angle other than 90 degrees.. it seems a bit soft and not at the best angle."
1,Kimba fans should save their money,"""The New Adventures of Kimba"" is what Pioneer Family Entertainment called the 1989 Japanese remake of the beloved Kimba the White Lion series. It was a misbegotten idea to begin with; a morose, lifeless series that ultimately insults everyone who has fond memories of Kimba. Pioneer tried to Americanize the series and soften it down to a ""3 and up"" rating. They were somewhat successful because they only dealt with the earliest episodes of this series, which sank further into insanity and depression as it went along. But what you end up with on this video is a poorly voice-acted (...) re-write of a couple of bad TV shows. Why bother?"
3,How 'bout some cheese with your blood soup?,"Loved the instrumentals (which take up most of the CD), but for the most part the vocal tracks are amateurish and pretty cheesy. No hard funk in the mix, but plenty of choppy and groovy action tracks...even some creepy suspense tracks toward the end! I'd have given this album 5 STARS if it weren't for the barely-listenable vocal tracks, which I usually just skip altogether when listening to this CD. The rest of the album is HIGHLY recommended for BLAXPLOITATION and HORROR soundtrack collectors alike..."
5,classic,"Gene Page's Blackula soundtrack is a great film score. Gene Page's Blackula is also a kicker soul album.Though for the black comedy film, this soundtrack functions as most 1970s R&B; albums functioned. A mix of soul, funk, and some disco flair--though the disco is more implied than it is out and out boogie round.The instrumentals, and there are a lot, are heavy funk with flutes, pumping bass, and wha wha guitars. While the soul is nowhere near gutbucket, it is not sweet soul either. But listen to the passion in the singing, for instance, of the Hues Corporation numbers. It reminds me Al Kooper's brand of 1960s R&B.;Essential"
3,"Cute, but not so good for crafts","These buttons were cute, but are better suited for kids projects rather than grown up crafts."
4,Good craft product for preschoolers,These buttons are a great size for preschoolers to glue on to projects and designs. The colors are vivid and varied. My kids enjoyed them.
3,German Handguns,"While wide-ranging and very well written, deep coverage of the most important German handguns is sacrificed to make room for little known and inconsequential models. I have no idea whether the book lives up to its claim of completeness, but I found the sections on the Mauser C96 and Luger P-08 disappointingly superficial. The illustrations appear to have been afterthoughts and are of indifferent quality.In all, this book is overpriced by half for what you get."
4,Postwar Urban Fable,"The Window is a Noirish take on The Boy Who Cried Wolf, supurbly acted by a terrific cast. It's also a great document of the urban decay that took place in America's cities during the Depression and World War II immediately before widespread suburbanization. It's simply inexcusable that this stunning film isn't currently available on DVD in the US."
4,Thrilling,"I would like to give this product 5 stars but honestly: its not restored, its a DVD-R, No Chapters - thats ok so far. But NO SUBTITLES are available.The Picture quality changes a little bit. On the beginning any scenes has some defects (watchable) but mainly - for a not restored movie the quality is very good.AND NOW THE BIGGEST PLUS:Bobby Driscoll, loaned exclusively from Disney to RKO to making this movie. I never heard or saw this movie before. The only reason to buy this DVD was just this amazing talented child actor Bobby Driscoll where died (sadly) very young.""The Window"", mady in 1949, is a film noir and absolutely very thrilling. Specially the hunt on the end. I was really speechless. THE STORY: Tommy, is lying and telling some weird stories. But one night he saw a murder. But who's believe him now? His Parents? The Police?FAZIT: thrilling. Buy it and enjoy this amazing acting.SUPPORTING: Barbara Hale, Ruth Roman."
1,Server+,I bought IT Essensial II Network Operating System Companion Guide for Server+ exam based on CompTIA recomendation. After I read this book I found very litle knowledge about Server+ exam. This book has good staf about networking but not for server+ exam.Yes I passed Server+ exam but I supplement this book with Server+ Bible by Trevor Kay.
3,Well Worth a Holla,"This was not just black people replacing white people in the same old ""youths up in the cabin"" slasher flick. This was a good movie. It was character driven and well acted. A surprise ending in this genre is always a surprise. I must say, I was surprised by the ending. As a major slasher fan, I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is no Friday the 13th or Halloween, but it is a very good movie. The black people acted as we black people woule expect them to act in this situation. As a matter of fact, that is one of the things that was so appealing in the movie; so many of the characters reminded me of people I actually know, which provided for some comical moments. While this movie may not beg for a sequel, it is well worth what I paid for it."
2,"Warning: this is NOT the IM ""After-Shave Balm"" as listed, it is the IM ""After-shave Imulsion"" which is different","I ordered this because it was described as the ""After-shave Balm"" but when I received it I immediately noticed it didn't smell right. Upon closer inspection I realized the item received is actually the emulsion not the balm product. Personally, I don't care for the emulsion scent -- just the balm one. When I looked very close at the product image on Amazon I realized it does show the emulsion product. So the seller should really correct the item description to reflect that is the IM after-shave emulsion."
2,Great looking but could function better,This little stereo looks great on the shelf but the sound is just OK. Also organization of the remote is just so-so yet that is the only way to control the machine.Forget about navigating MP3's on CD. It's just too difficult to be worthwhile.
3,Incorrect description,"I'm returning this product unopened because it is incorrectly described. According to the description, it requires one AA battery to operate. That was an important feature to me. But it really requires button cells."
3,Instructions?,Nice trick but it would have been nice to receive instructions.... I purchased this as a gift and received a pen in the mail. Small tag in the package refers to a website to retrieve instructions.
2,Disappointed Child as No Instructions,"Overall, this is fairly disappointing as there are no instructions at all included in the packaging: just a small slip of paper that says if you want to know how to use the thing, go to a particular website to find out more. This was fairly disappointing to the 9 year old I sent it to who doesn't have Internet access - heck, there are more instructions on the graphic display for the toy itself!Once an adult with Internet access was able to go look at the instructions, it worked well. Too bad the manufacturer couldn't spend another half cent in order to not disappoint the target audience!"
5,AWESOME DANCE TRAXX!!,"This CD has the hottest dance songs from '95. The standout songs are Real McCoys ""Run Away (Club Attack Mix)"", La Bouche's Be My Lover (US Club Mix), and Matrix's ""Can U Feel It"". The best feature on this CD is that it is all mixed 2gether, so it is a non-stop dance party. This CD is gold, if you like Dance Music, mixed with some R&B. Get This CD!!!"
3,hi fi audiophiles beware,"This is a great collection, but sound quality on this disc is kind of poor. I think a lot of these songs were recorded off old scratchy vinyl, there are pops and static crackle.It is good collection though, and there are a lot of non-hit tracks, but if sound quality really matters, you might want to get the cleopatra records compilation. These guys are the best old school goth, and borrowed a lot from Joy Division (who hasn't lately).If your into Interpol, check out these guys."
5,I luv luv luv this.,"I think this wastebasket is a great size for the bathroom. My son dropped this and some other bathroom pieces and they didn't break. I have an extra one that someone gave me without knowing I couldn't wait for Christmas and I had to buy this so I am offering it for sale, (although I would love to keep it just in case I ever get a his and hers bathroom). I really glad I found these pieces right before they discontinued. This style, as common as it may seem, is not so common in the market place for a great quality and low price. Croscill is a really great brand."
5,nice nice...,"I love Croscill Townhouse! Very ellegant pattern similar to dover manor (dunhill) a now deleted line. lovely porcelain, heavy weight."
5,Tools for Team Excellence,"Dr. Gregg Huszczo provides a great road map for team development. He has laid out practical exercises for Steering teams to follow through out the journey to teams- from assessing the need for team development, getting ready for teams, and implementing, evaluating and nurturing team success.Huszczo delivers common sense information much like he delivers in person, in a simple pragmatic way- he is easy to understand by all levels in an organization.This book provides a hands-on guide for team development and teamwork. If you are considering implementing teams this is a good easy read and you'll want to use it weekly as a guide.I hope to write back one year from now and document how this hands-on guide helped in our process of team development. There are so many unknowns and directions teams can take- ""Tools for Team Excellence"" provides a roadmap.Good luck in changing the culture of your organization and team development process.Joe BoyleManufacturing Engineer"
2,Warps easily but good product,I have this installed on a 3HP motor driving a small dc generator and without noticing til later the pulley is actually warped and seems to be getting worse day after day. But it does work.
1,Terrible.,"I ordered these sticks with high intentions, however, they were poorly made and the first 10 minutes of playing with them the bead broke off of the stick. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THESE STICKS."
2,Disappointing!,"This basket arrived beautifully wrapped, yet some of the boxes inside were damaged. The food inside was not as appealing as that pictured on the website, and the taste was quite mediocre. Save your money and choose something else."
1,"Cheap, breakable plastic","This is a huge dish rack with excellent drainage. However, the sides are clip on plastic pieces which broke within 2 months of use. The plastic parts hold your glasses and silverware. They clip into the stainless steel rack. The hole in the plastic that gets clippped into the stainless steel broke and no longer stays attached. The glass ""fingers"" to hold glasses, broke. Not that they ever held glasses. Everything fell off of them. This is the worse dish rack I've ever owned. If the plastic was replaced by metal, it would be great. I'm sorry I dumped my Rubbermaid dish rack and replaced it with this one."
1,Will not last long...,"I actually like the design of OXO products, including this dish rack. The tray is great and will always send the water to the sink. Unfortunately, this is not a rust-proof rack. In a matter of months, it started to rust and I only noticed because I saw tiny reddish spots on the edge of my white dishes since you need to look closer at the rack to see them.. If I'm gonna spend 50-60 bucks, I expect that it be rust-proof!"
3,"Nice design, but has some issues","Overall, this rack has definitely been better than some of the cheaper racks I've brought, so far (2 years+ of use) no rust on the metal, and unlike others we don't seem to have had issues with it falling apart, or plastic clips breaking, or anything like that.We have broken one of the cup prongs, but we were using them for drying baby bottles (heavy glass baby bottles) so I blame that on us.The reason for only three stars, two major complaints, one is that the spout part seems to be growing some sort of mold, which is impossible to clean off, the other is that, as others have said, the cutlery holder has extremely poor drainage which means it gets quite dirty, and is really hard to get clean."
2,Great at first - didn't hold up,"When I first bought this rack I though it was great! It's large enough to hold many pots and pans, has a knife holder, tabs for holding water bottles, and a tray for small items lite water bottle caps and small lids.But eventually, the shortcomings started appearing. One of the water bottle holders broke. Then several of the tabs holding the plastic ends broke, so now occasionally one end falls off dumping the contents of the rack into the sink. The mouth of the drainboard is a soft rubber or plastic, it has gotten stained by mildew. A second bottle holder has also broken.I've yet to find a dish rack of the size and with the nice features this one has. However, the quality isn't there and in the end I have gotten very frustrated with the rack. I'm still using it, since I haven't found a replacement I'm happy with."
2,Great For dry products,I got these funnels but did not have the big square one.... anyway was looking for them to refill ketchup bottles and well the wet products do not go through the funnels to well takes longer then any other method you would use. But they do work well for dry things
3,"Keeps the heat out, difficult to use","To be honest, not exactly what I was expecting. I wish I had gotten one that folds instead of rolls. Folding takes seconds, rolling this huge thing can take a minute or more. It fits my vehicles windshield, which is why I got it, as the other generics I tried were either too small or JUMBO. In the southwest summer heat, this thing works really well but I just wish it was easier to put up."
2,Save your money,"I did not like this moisturizer at all. It is too thick and does not penetrate your hair or scalp.It just sits on your hair in a big white glob. This is the only product by this line that I did not care for. The shampoo and conditioner works great,but this was a complete waste of money."
5,Excellent Writing Reference....,Eileen Root's book on Hawaii'an and English names is an excellent reference for writers and for those who are looking for names for their children. The first half is a list of Hawaii'an names and their definitions. The second half is a list of Anglo names and their Hawaii'an equivalent.This is a must have for those interested in finding authentic Hawaii'an names for your research.
1,not what i expected at all,this is not a good book to find a hawaiian name for your child. i have a better and older one that was only $1.50 and it has been much more helpful. i wouldnt but this one if you are looking to find a name and learn how to pronounce it.
5,Very scholarly,"I just wanted to mention that the famous line in the Yeats poem, the one that goes:And what rough beast, its hour come at last,Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?was probably a reference to my poor uncle Ted with a bad case of the scabies. He's prone to skin rashes of various origins but of almost Biblical proportions. But the ones caused by those damn ""crotch crickets"" are the worst.Other than the minor omission of the above point, I found this to be an excellent and scholarly book on the subject."
5,Loved it!,"With the recent popularity of Survivor, Frontier House and Pioneer House on TV, this is a refreshing change. If you have children that complain about chores, this is a great book for them Without being preachy or overly-dramatic Cullen describes the difficulties daily life way back then."
1,Nelly the meanie,"None of the characters in this book seem to have any depth, or any personalities, except for Margery. I feel sorry for Margery, but then again she was a dimwit to marry the guy in the first place. Nelly is isolated from civilization, and she seems to despise everyone, except for critters. She's so bitter because she's never been in a different environment other than the wilderness, where the law of nature says only the strongest survive. Which results in her turning mean, selfish, and bitter, in order to scramble over and trample everyone and everything to reach the top of the doggie pile.The end of the book didn't seem like an end, it needed at least five more chapters, or a sequel.I found the book to be incomplete, the characters shallow and bitter and the plot to be nonexsistent. The negatives far outweigh the positives. I don't know what possessed the auther to write such a horrible book. If it was possible I would give this book 0 stars. Major yuck!!"
2,Disappointing!,"The product description and the product picture don't match what was sent. We were sent a 17"" inflatable shuttle. Not made of premium material and there is a tiny piece on it which if you poked a hole I guess you could call it a hook for hanging it. We wanted to hang this in the kid's room for the space theme, but we're so disappointed with the size and the quality of this product. I would not recommend it, especially for the price we paid. I was also going to immediately return it, but it's not your typical easy Amazon return..."
5,BSI 3 Ball Bowling Bag,"I absolutely love the new bag I bought from BSI. I'm a pretty decent bowler (avg. 170), so I needed a bag that held at least 2 balls. I decided to get the three-ball bag just in case I got a new ball. There is plenty of storage space for shoes and any other things that you need to bowl your best. I highly recommend this product.."
2,BSI Champion 3 Roller Bag,"I thought that the bag would be great after reading some reviews but was I ever disappointed!! The velcro attaching ball platform system for the balls comes ""unstuck"" and causes everything to go askew. The elastic holding straps for the balls cannot hold them in place with the bottoms coming unstuck and they subsequently shift around. Once when everything ""let go"" I was attempting to put my bag in my truck and when everything shifted I tried to catch it and hurt my back. This was about 3 weeks ago and it is still hurting to the point that I am now using a two ball bag and a buffer sling to carry the 3rd. ball. I expect I will have to stop bowling for several weeks to let my back heal."
1,Maybe if you've never read a comic before,"I expected to learn something about creating comics, art, or the comics industry by reading this book, in the end I learned nothing. Instead of any insight into writing or communication, the classroom scenes focus on things that you should have learned in high school English (like a basic story arc) or that you can learn by reading one comic (pages are laid out into panels, panels should have backgrounds, comic book scripts are like movie scripts, etc). As for learning about the comics industry you find out that if you go to a comics convention you can have a professional artist critque your work, which I believe I learned in the letters section of Robin when I was 12. Oh, well I guess that you also learn that if you take Bob and Mark's class you might get published regardless of how bad your artwork is.Please note that nearly everyone else who has reviewed this book knows the authors personally and has taken their class."
5,"Great CD, horribe price.","I friggen love this anime series and this CD. It has some of the best songs Ive ever heard on an anime, and everyone should hear it.However $44.000 isnt worth it. There are way better deals online if you just search for it."
3,HP 1 Pack Q5949A Black Cartridge for HP Laserjet 1160/1320,"I haven't used the ink cartridge yet, so I can't rate it. It arrived well packaged and in good time."
3,Perfect Resumes and a Perfect Scam,"The book is one of the better guides to writing good resumes. Good examples are provided. But Jackson and company are also pulling a sales scam. Try to download the free templates and you'll find they never arrive in your inbox. Go back to the site in an attempt to really get them, and you'll find they are now $4.95 (because they've already been sent). Beware the liar!"
1,"Okay, but there's better things out there","Resume writing is great and all for finding jobs, but this book and others like it is hardly worth it. It's easier to go to [...] and get guaranteed assistance in getting a job, and not just career building. Thanks to them I can actually see ton's of openings in thousands of positions from small company's to Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 Companies. I'd recommend this website before any silly book anyday."
5,Great piece of exercise,"I bought mine and never had a problem with it. It works great, it is silent, the lights are neon so you can't miss data that is displayed on the monitor.10 incline levels, 3 main types of exercise (you can customize your own work,too), 2 dumbells, a little fan...what else does one need?Overall, I am still enjoying it. I recommend this product. Sincerely."
1,"Tries, but terribly misguided","I was a bit dismayed with Hook's book because in reality it just reiterates the cliche'd notions we all have about gender and gender relationships. Bell attempts to influence readers to adopt miandrists beliefs, albeit she does so subtly. Males do have emotions although perhaps we often don't see that, and Hook's insensitivity to the male gender is subtle, but still ubiquidous throughout the book. I cannot reccomend this book because like many modern works that attempt to persuade readers to ""follow the inner self"" this work actually harbors hate"
1,do not read,this book is not good. It is the reason why men are so frustrated with much of the womyn's literature that is coming out. If you hate men and like womyn and are a womyn...read this book. If you are human and do not hate people...stay away...it is toxic...
4,bell hooks & communion,I have recommended this book to all those women in my life who have sold out to the patriarchal values in American culture because I want them to find communion with a more enlightened man and not settle for anything less.
3,"Okay, but....","This is my first bell hook's book. I think her book ""Communion: The Female Search for Love"" is good but a little weak on the feminism and radicalism she is noted for. Unfortunately, I find that some of her suggestions regarding how to find love may or may not be really helpful. Maybe this works for her but it may not work for others.Most women who are in my age group (late twenties or thirties) find that men are emotionally draining as well as emotionally witholding. Also, I have found that most men enjoy the idea of having alternative relationships with women because it offers them benefits without the costs of investment in any one woman (hooks refers to this concept too). Busy women, like myself, don't have time to invest in men who are not providing value. Women need to concentrate on the power they do have - negotiation. Saying to a male partner, ""You give me what I want, and maybe you'll get what you want from me"" is still an approriate method for social interaction."
3,An interesting corner of Jewish philosophical development,"Westerners think of skeptical approaches to Biblical texts as fairly recent in our history, but there are hints of critical thinking that go back centuries. That's the message I took from this book, and I found that worthwhile, but it's a rather narrow message in a work that is otherwise devoted to interesting but arcane academic investigations."
5,Building the 12 hour canoe,"We have made these as part of youth programmes in Western Australia. They take us about 30 hours to build with groups of 4 to 5 working on them. These people have never made anything before so progress is slower than you would first think. They are a great project, we use cheap ply and paint them well seems to work fine. The group gets a great deal for the building process. I keep meaning to build one for myself, perhaps this time round I will"
4,The downside to immortality,"This movie is a really nice change of pace from the seemingly unending stream of same-old, same-old vampire movies. We Are the Night examines the costs of immortality, but it's not a whoa-is-me-I'm-a-monster story, instead it's a look at what it means to live forever in a world where everything that matters is ephemeral."
5,get the non dubbed version--worth it,"I watched the dubbed version, liked it, bought the original subtitled version. Really a great job on the flick. Worth the watch (and I cant stand dubbed movies normally) Not what it appears from the cover. Terrible picture on the front belies a very good flick. Watch it. Its good."
2,Slow and Boring,"I watched this hoping for a decent vampire movie, it is not.It's a slow movie that explores a world where the only vamps are female and typically lesbians and/or ravers. Not that I dislike lesbians or ravers, but its just touches on the clichés and doesn't really deliver. If you watch it and it bores you too, leave a lack luster review and save the next poor viewer from having their evening sucked away. (That bad pun is better than the movie!)"
1,The Worst,"I just attempted to view this piece of utter garbage based on two, nearly five star, reviews. My question is who is writing these reviews? Because if it is not the people who made this waste of time and energy than it has to be people from another planet. The acting is something that cannot even be rated as acting; it is sooo bad. The cinematography is non-existent. I am now a firm believer in conspiracy theories. Because for more than one person to say this is anything but cinematic vomit, has to be some kind of plot. Give your two dollars to a homeless person than sit at your desk and rub your eyes real hard, tilt your head back and look at the stars your eyes make. There is more thematic elements of story in that action than there is in this boondoggle. Pass,pass,pass, pass."
5,:-> Beautifully Fanged! Sequels Coming? + Deutsch Vampir Mädchen sind die schönsten!,"I absolutely LOVE this German supernatural-action movie! Every female vampire character was beautifully crafted, complete with their unique personal traits. The special effects were very BELIEVABLE - at least to me, very beautifully done!!!The American ""Twilight"" series was overladen with computer image trickery and can't stand a candle to ""We are the night""!The ""best"" American vampire series to date, IMO, is ""Vampire Diaries"". At the very least, ""Vampire Diaries"" has a decent plot. You could also enjoy ""Supernatural"".The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First SeasonSupernatural: The Complete First SeasonIf you're looking for a comedy, check out the British ""Lesbian Vampire Killers"".Lesbian Vampire Killers (Ws)I hope that the Germans will continue creating hot female vampire movies in the years to come! ;-)I highly recommend ""We are the night""! :-)Heil Deutschland!Deutsch Vampir Mädchen sind die schönsten! ;-)"
3,Audio mapped to wrong channels,"Would have given it 5 stars if the channels weren't mapped incorrectly in the German soundtrack. Had to watch it in stereo because hearing the center channel dialogue coming from the front right channel in 5.1 mode was just too annoying. Will be ripping the disc, demuxing the audio, correcting the channels, remuxing, then burning a corrected copy. The English dub is mapped correctly.. but who wants to listen to that crap?This is the second time I have seen this happen on a movie. The other was R-Point."
4,If only everyone could have the assets,"I read this book as a class requirement and I loved it. True, there may be some gaps in the research, but the point is clear: We must have a mindset that youth are valuable and worth investing time in and these 40 assets provide you with a framework and a mindset that will help you help youth around you. These may not be the absolute 40 things that work (they never claim to be) but they sure are things every child/youth can benefit from: caring adults, postive peer influence, achievement motivation, etc.I highly recommend this for any parent, teacher, or anyone that works with youth on a regular basis."
1,Worst game ever!,I figured this game would be fun packed with old arcade style games but it was nothing of the sort. The graphics were worse then original asteroids. The games practically un-playable. I advise against purchasing this game.
2,Retro games were cool....when the came out,"I grew up playing games in arcades, and at home on my Atari 5200. I thought buying this game would bring me back to the fun I had as a kid. It didn't. The game itself is fine, however with the upgraded technologies (graphics, sounds, controls) of todays games, these just don't seem fun anymore."
3,"Great interface, sucky games","The menu screen is awesome -- it really does look like a 1980s rec room. I like the way you choose a game from the rack, and the 80s music playing in the background was cool too.But let's not forget: these are early-80s games. They suck on toast.I'm not sure it's worth paying full price for this game, just for the nostalgia factor. I'd suggest waiting until it shows up in the bargain bin."
3,Great idea but not worth the price,"Service was excellent (which you pay for) but product was definitely mediocre. I bought this to use when the electric is out for most of a night so I can be sure to wake up for work the next day. Lantern is normal. Difficult to insert batteries and plastic housing is a little flimsy. Alarm clock seems to work fine, but to hear the radio I have to hold my hand against the side of the speaker?? Sharperimage has similar items, even a tv/alarm clock that operates on batteries. I'll try them next time."
5,I Love McCaffrey's Pern,"My parrot got to the copy I was reading for maybe the fourth time, so ordered this to replace it.Every once in a couple of years I reread the Pern series and update it with new books that have come out in the series. And each find parts I forgot I read and enjoy all over again."
4,Good but not great,"Well worth reading although not up to the standards that Ms McCaffrey set in her early Pern stories. There are an assortment of inconsistencies in the book - many of which have been pointed out by other reviewers. One of the ones that really bugged me is that after 2500 years on Pern, they are just now discovering Zaranth's talent? I could maybe accept that if there was a mutation which just manifested in her but the fact that she could train all the others implies that it's been there forever. Hard to believe that one. And it drives me a bit crazy that the dragon riders (and dragons) continue to forget the concept of ""timing"" it except when it's conveniently needed for the plot line.That being said, I really did enjoy reading the story and I do recommend it to anyone who loves the world of Pern."
5,"Humanity, No Matter What Planet","This story is true to humanity; the humans are loyal, no matter what side. Once a belief is chosen, it is adhered to if it rings true to the person's soul. The McCaffreys show how Truth can be adamant no matter what side of an issue a person is in. Shankolin's Truth was just as strong as F'lar and Lessa's; as Robinton's and Jaxom's. My only gripe with this story...? Oddly enough, it's that Larad's Lady Holder name is suddenly different. In ""All the Weyrs of Pern,"" her name was Lady Jissamy. In ""The Skies of Pern,"" it's some name that starts with a D. Do I wish that someone had gone back and checked? Sure. Ignoring that, I believe the McCaffreys - Anne and Todd - have a firm grasp on how humans believe, remember, and think. This story fits well with Life After AIVAS."
3,Eh...,"I enjoy Anne McCaffrey a WHOLE lot & while this was an interesting book, it wasn't her best. Pegasus in Space was extremely disappointing, this much less so. Sort of a book of tying up loose ends and throwing in a love interest. Worth getting from the library or waiting until paperback, don't spring for the hardback of it."
3,"Good ideas, but boring","I agree with some of the previous reviews: great to be back to Pern, but ""Skies"" reuses far too many old plot lines mashed together without cohesion. The return of the anti-Aivas group is unconvincing, and F'lessan's romance is basically F'nor/Breke rehashed, only not as interesting because it all works out happily in a matter of pages. I had hoped that McCaffrey would develop the question of what would happen once Thread was gone (""After"") more thoroughly, but it instead comes to a trite and unrealistic conclusion. Most of the book is spent in conversations between characters about what's going on, or in excessively drawn-out descriptions of the few action sequences. Essentially, this book would be much better if it were shorter; it's long on dialog and short on plot."
3,Fun only if you're a Pern fan,"I was glad I got the book from our local library instead of buying it. I sat and read it through in less than a night, not because it was that gripping but because I could skim a lot of it. The main drama is buried under a lot of visiting with 'old friends' that really doesn't have much to do with the plot. And when the drama hits, it is quickly solved with something that is suddenly tossed in as an ""oh, here's the answer, something that just suddenly appears, now let's go back to socializing"". An interesting subplot gets introduced, then left hanging at the end of the book, so she obviously (hopefully) plans to solve it in the next one.I figure I needed to read it to know what goes on in the next one; but it's not one I'm putting on my shelf, not even as paperback, unless someone buys it as a gift for me or I get it in a sale. And I'm certainly waiting on buying any more until I check them out at the library to make sure they're worth paying for."
4,Very good..and some misconceptions corrected,"OK I really enjoyed this book, not as good as the first books, nothing ever will be IMHO. There is one major thing people keep harping on and another previous reviewer also corrected. It never says Mirriam is a gold rider or a Weyrleader. It says she is T'Gellan's weyrmate, that is all and that certainly has not in prior novels ever meant they were automatically a Weyrleader.There are many examples of the Weyrleaders having separate mates from each other.This book was wonderful, I enjoyed the new issues and charcters, I like how Anne is evolving the stories I've loved for more that 20 years and I hope she will continue to do so....."
2,The Skies of Pern,"Would that I had not read the reviews, other wise I would have not ordered it. It was not a thrill. The last book was horrid and this is little better."
3,an average book,"I have read (and reread) every one of the Pern novels + all of the offshoots. I found this book to be ""average"" - not great - not horrible. It is certainly better than some of the others I have read. I feel that her series is becoming more technologically oriented, and less people/dragon oriented; hence the title (to me) is a misnomer and misleading. What I found very disappointing was all of the loose ends - clearly a ploy to ""hook"" the reader into buying the next book, which we may see in my lifetime."
3,Pern meets Deep Impact,"Definantly a read for fans because of the characters -- this book concerntrates on F'lessan and Tia, a new character -- but not for the plot. It lacks originality -- the title of this review says it all -- and has one or two major holes. Admitedly, plot holes are characteristic to many of the later Pern books, so it shouldn't be surprising. The 'new' profession of the riders, after fall, strikes one as paranoid and degrading after the real dangers of Thread. However, the characters make up for all the problems and issues of the book."
5,Exactly what I hoped for--and more,"Not everyone liked this book, apparently, but I did. I thought that Ms. McCaffrey's (and, to an extent, F'lessan and Tai's) solution to the ""What will dragons do now?"" problem was original and it made wonderful sense. I thought that it ranked high up there, along with the rest of the Pern series. If you're a Pern fan and you've been waiting to see what will/would happen after ""All the Weyrs of Pern"", then read this.I had one disappointment. The whole gang of familiar characters returned (with the exception of Robinton, of course, but it's obvious he's missed), even Jayge at one point, but what happened to Piemur and Jancis? I was dying to know what happened to the two of them, where they settled down, that sort of thing (or maybe they mentioned it somewhere and I forgot). Oh well, F'lessan is one of my favorites, and Tai's a great character with an interesting situation, and the book is well worth the twenty bucks for the hardcover version. Read it."
4,"Some great elements but overall ""rushed"" feeling","I was ecstatic to see a new Pern book coming out and started reading the minute I got it. While I loved the development of some familiar characters I got the feeling that the book was written in a rush (possibly due to the overwhelming demand of fans like me). I enjoyed following the progression of the dragonriders from hold-beholden to more independence and would like to have had the entire book explore that. While I realize that humanity (even on Pern) has it's negative elements, the nightly news gives me enough of that - I'd rather focus on more positive aspects, or at least the human response to natural catastrophies.All-in-all, a good book and a great addition to the Pern series."
5,Soaring,"I expect action, dragons and a sense of how life is on Pern whenever I read a new Pern book. The action is far-flung and not all in the skies. The romance adds to the characters and the plot of what will dragons do after the end of Thread is compelling. I did find minor publishing problems, but I desire being swept away to a world of difference when I read about Pern and this book soared and my onlu unhappiness was that I reached the end far too quickly. I will have to endure this world until the next foray to Pern. Thanks, Anne, for a great ride."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book because I have read everything else written about Pern (and several other series for that matter) and loved most of them. Unfortunately, I felt that this book introduced too many sub-plots that were not completed and reused too many from previous novels (I am tired of reading about the gang of misfits causing trouble). Mid-way through the book, I felt that was oblidged to finished, but not really all that interested. Sorry, Anne."
5,A great Pern book with more dragons & riders,"This was one of the better Pern books (although I liked them all). There is more interaction with dragons and riders in this than in several other books. I just wanted to add my 5 stars and hope for more books like this! Thanks, Anne!"
1,Disappointing,"Before Pern were Jack Vance and Michael Moorcock, both of whom wrote about sentient dragons working in harness with humans. Neither author sentimentalized their subject. This stuff seems like pony books dressed up as science fiction. Maybe if I hadn't read the Great Originals first I might have gotten more out of this, but these don't strike me as adult books at all. Maybe there are more substantial books in the series but I kinda doubt it. If you want great dragons try Vance or Moorcock's latest Dreamthief's Daughter. This is soft-core fantasy. The best you get from it is a sugar high. This girl prefers her romance full-blooded!"
1,Sadly disappointed,"This is not a review as such for it is the first McCaffrey book that I refused to finish reading. As a tried and true fan of the Dragonriders series-especially the earlier books, I looked forward to returning to the world of the dragonriders, although I have found the more recent novels lacking in full character development and cohesive plots. I checked this novel out from the library, and after less than fifty pages was grateful I hadn't purchased it. Think I'll go back and reread my copies of the earliest novels in the series, you know, the ones with the straightforward and consistent storylines, focused on just a few well-fleshed out and engaging characters. On attempting to read this offering I found myself not even caring about Lessa and F'lar. I regret the downfall of a once enchanting and engrossing series."
3,Good....but not the best in the series,"I was very excited to FINALLY get my hands on this book.When I first started reading it, i was thrown right into the middle of a plot line. Throughout the book, I got lost on several parts, being as there wasn't a lot of lead in to several areas. As the book progressed, I became more and more interested, but was sadly dissappointed when i reached the end.Usually, a good book WANTS you to wonder what happens next, but this one made me wonder: ""Is this /really/ the end of this book? I mean, what?!""Let's just say it is the only book in the series I won't give a raving review for."
4,To be continued,"Overall a very good book. It does a very good job of portraying the transition as a society faces a major upheaval.However, I was very disappointed with the ""to be continued"" near the end of the book. All of her other Dragonrider books had closure but left room for sequels without being so overt as in this one.On the other hand even though they played relatively minor rolls in this book it was still nice to meet some of my favorite characters again, Flar, Lessa, Jaxom, as well as learn more about some of the others."
3,Not the Best,"I was disappointed with this book; the book creates more questions than it answers. I found it dry and disjointed; definitely not on the same level as Ms. McCaffrey's other books. Normally, I find it difficult to put one of her books down; I had trouble staying interested in this one."
5,The gripping continuation of the Pern saga,"The Dragonriders who have long defended Pern against the dreaded Thread falls are preparing for the last battle - thereafter to retire, the threat abolished forever. Others resist change and the technology which has brought it, and decide to change the face of Pern with violence in this gripping continuation of the Pern saga."
5,My fantasy world continues and I am well pleased,"Anne has been my ""friend & companion"" for over 30 years. She has yet to let me down. I wait impatiently every year to loose myself in her imagination. This book continues my fantasy/dream life, while I continue here in reality. Apart from a few slip-ups,it gave me affermation that my lovely dragons and Pern will continue."
4,Anne McCaffrey gets an A plus from me,"Wether it be dragons or dinosaurs, I can really get into the McCaffrey books. They are all great reads and not one should be missed and this is no exception. I think everything has a time and a place and in this book, there is a time and place for everything. Anne McCaffrey has lead me into many new worlds and into many adventures, my favorites of the characters are Moretta, Menoly, Acorna and others. If you loved some of her characters as much as I do this is a book for you. Follow up on the world of Pern and begin a new adventure. Try not to miss out on the fun and exciting world of Anne McCaffrey by reading all of her books as I have an extended collection and all are my favorites and I enjoy rereading them and listening to them on tape. Very enjoyable, and I am thankful to her for creating such lasting fun for me to go to another place and time....Thank you."
3,"At times entertaining, but&#65533;","unexcusably sloppy at others. As others have stated, this book has myriad problems, and REALLY seems a chapter or two short. What's up Anne? And how could none of your editors catch that the female protagonist's name is misspelled on the back of the paperback version?! (Tai/Tia) Hopefully, we'll see a better effort next go 'round."
2,watch stopped working after 8 months,This watch stopped working after 8 months and my complaint to amazon did not ellicit a response.
1,False Advertisement,I did receive a double pack but you have send me the wrong one. I ordered the Yugioh Double pack 1 and you send me the Double Pack 2
1,BPSHOPZONE sent me a wrong version.,"The product title and photo is misleading. YOU ARE GOING TO RECEIVE Yu-Gi-Oh Double Pack With: Destiny Board Traveler & Dungeon Dice Monsters.Not a good purchase, im very disappointed with this, please take my review in mind before placing an order about this game."
5,Martin Luther is the truth!,"I had heard about Matin Luther from one of my cousins a year and a half ago. I had put off buying the cd, but finally broke down and got it when my cousin saw him on the Mo'nique show. I am so glad that I finally bought the cd. He is everything that I sampled off amazon and more. I only hope that he gets to put another cd out. He does have a live disc, but it is only available on itunes. Martin if you are reading this and to anyone else who likes good r&b cop the cd and stay on course Martin, you made one helluva record!"
3,Interesting story,"This novel was one with a riveting story, plot twists all the way, and whenver there was an action scene they were a decent length and very interesting"
4,"Working with ""A Cure for the Common Life""","Max Lucado always expresses ideas with the most beautiful and accurate word pictures. This book provides the reader a workbook to try to uncover the unique gifts God has provided from birth, in order to understand our purpose on earth. He urges us to dissect every period of our life from childhood on, to zero in on the activities that made us the happiest; those pursuits that made time stand still, and which we would do whether or not we were being paid. God has provided us continuous clues throughout life that lead us to the unique work that will enable us to praise Him fully, in the optimum way we designed for us."
4,Great Book,This book is a great read if your trying to get back to how God created you to be. I recommend it to anyone who is praying about enjoying everyday life and making the most of what God has given them.
5,Life Changing,"If you're stuck, frustrated or bored with where you are in your life, read this book. Meditate on it and apply it, then go out and live it."
4,Max Lucado has done it again!,"Mr. Lucado is a great writer, so easy to read and so inspiring, truly God must have His hand on Max's shoulder as he writes. This is a very good book and I highly recommend it."
4,"Calling all moms... read ""Cure"" and be encouraged!","I savored ""Cure for the Common Life"" and wish I had read it earlier. It is a literary piece that speaks to readers, no matter where they are in life.It's never too late to recognize your life's calling and strengths -- and begin to live in your 'sweet spot'. I especially encourage mommies who don't have a lot of time for self-help to dive into this book. I found myself smiling while reading it. Readers would be wise to follow the steps to identify one's sweet spot as explained in the book. It's easy, fun and an opportunity to recognize God's goodness in one's life!Lucado's work is a blessing. I can't get enough of his writing style."
5,Amazing Book,Such an Amazing book. I wish I had gotten it sooner. Very thought provoking and uplifting!!!
5,read this!,"I may be Andrea Eagan's daughter, however that shouldn't cloud my view of the book too much, should it? Ms. Eagan taps into the emotions of young girls so well you find yourself wondering if she herself was not still a young woman when she wrote it. Her insight to the problems we face when entering puberty and all through our adolescence is so correct. She helps us understand why we feel the way we feel and what we can do to help ourselves. This is in no way a self help book. Ms. Eagan offers herself to young women as a friend and guide, not some random doctor making a quick buck. She died of cancer just as i hit puberty and were it not for her book I'd be completly lost. I highly reccomend this book for young women as well as for mothers and fathers of young women.. You will not regret it. Daisy Eagan."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased this software, used it religiously, and REGRET IT! I had put my entire guest list into this software, every address every phone number etc. Now, the program will load but the guest list will not, it simply freezes on this page. With my wedding only a month and a half away I've had to re-compile my list and look back up 240 addresses because their tech support does NOT EXIST, I have called, e-mailed, e-mailed e-mailed, etc to no avail. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY!"
1,Frustrated Future Bride,"I received this as a gift from my fiance. I have had the same problems with this as other reviewers. The software will not download and I can't get the ""Technical Support"" team to contact me back. The company apparently knows of their problems but is still selling this software to unsuspecting customers. If you haven't purchased this yet save yourself the trouble by not ordering this."
1,Don't buy this software!!!!,"I bought this software and could not open it on my computer, even though my computer meets the system requirements. There is no telephone technical support for this software. When I tried to use the live chat feature on the website for technical support, I could not get any answers either. I was told that my problem is a bug in the software and that the software engineers are working on an update. Don't buy this software unless you are willing to spend your money and then wait for an update - issue date unknown."
1,"It Doesn't Work, So Don't Waste Your Money","I purchased this, and was excited to get started planning my wedding. It was great to find software that would work on both Macs and PCs (Mac software is hard to find), and I had high hopes. However, I installed the software on my Mac, and the application will not even run! The publisher has no telephone tech support, and they did not respond to my email. I then tried the live chat for tech support, and they said that it sounded like I was missing some files. They said that they hoped to have an update sometime soon.In the meantime, I spent the money, and the software does not even work! Terrible tech support, and a company that offers no solution to fix software that won't even run...save your money and buy something else."
4,"Great Information, Little book",This book gives me information on the angles and lengths of rafters needed for any sloped roof. Not for everyone but if you need the right info it is easily understandable.
3,archaic tables for occasional roof-cutters,"If you cut an occasional roof, and want a handy reference, this is the book, especially if you're doing straight gable type roofs. The reason I say ""archaic"" is that the hand-held pocket calcuator has made the use of ""tables"" obsolete long ago. If you're serious about learning the almost-forgotten art of true roof-cutting, multi-hips with broken ridges, and so forth, get yourself a good little trig calculator, a used introd. trig text, and a copy of ""A Roof Cutter's Secrets to Framing the Custom Home"" by Will L. Holladay. Another useful albeit impossibly esoteric text is ""Roof Framing"" by Marshall Gross, for the truly hardcore."
2,right info but print is way to small,This book is printed only for the young with excellant eye sight print is way to small. This was a bad purchase for me.
5,great price,No better than the more expensive hanging baskets. Looks great and is exactly what I wanted/needed!
3,"Long wait, but decent product.","Finally received this set of baskets.I can see why some reviewers had problems with it breaking. The chains are not of the highest quality, but could be easily replaced with stronger chain for a few bucks from a local home improvement store.The listed weight limit is 10 pounds. I am pretty sure that these chains would fail at any weight greater than that. I have a 30 pound light hanging with just two chains that are a size larger than what comes with these baskets.Since I only plan on using it for onions, garlic, and ginger, I'm quite certain I won't have any problems. If I change my plans and decide to use it for potatoes, I will make the small investment and upgrade the chains.Minus one star for the chains and one star for the fact that this seller had it listed as ""In Stock"", when it wasn't."
4,great basket,"The basket came much faster than scheduled. It was a little tangled, but I got it fixed and it is now holding a whole pineapple, a bag of green apples, 2/3 of a shoebox of tomatoes from my garden, and 2 lbs of kiwi. It doesn't sway at all so my cats ignore it as long as there is nothing hanging out of the side."
5,Vegetable & Fruit Storage Basket,"Although it is of Chinese manufacture, this seems to be a well built and sturdy product. I intend to store produce in it, after I have installed a hanging device of some type. I filled it with taters, onions, bananas, etc. and found it to be a pretty heavy load. Need to find a sturdy support for hanging."
3,Little old lady from Pasadena.,One of links on one of two hanging baskets came loose shortly after purchaSE. tHOUGH REMEDIED WITH BALING WIRE ANNOYING
4,3 tier hanging baskets,I am very happy with my purchase :) they allow me to store things to make my cupboards less cluttered and always know where certain things are. Running a daycare in my home I don't have time to spare searching for cups and lids!
3,weak chains,"this kept coming apart so we wen to the hardware store bought some stronger chains, rebuilt it and now it's fine. very cheaply made."
4,Silver Apples Redux,"New York City - chilly night in 1969 - a friend showed up at the apartment I shared with a couple of other guys, insisting that we give a listen to Silver Apples. After proper preparation, we did so. The Simeon/Simeon combo reached us and we subsequently wore the grooves out of that LP.One can re-experience those thrilling days of yesteryear with this over-the-top (where we want to be!) CD combining the efforts of Simeon/Simeon with the Alchemysts.Then: Strictly fun and games.Now: Listening while I program!"
4,Long time Sinatra Fan,"This is probably one of the most complete selections I have ever seen. Having been a Sinatra fan since the late 1940s, I have a lot of very fond memories of seeing him in person, first with the TD band, personal concerts, Old Gold Radio Show, and Your Hit Parade Radio show, plus many personal appearances in the Los Angeles area and Las Vegas. This book complements my own collection of Sinatra memorabelia. It's nice to read an authorized book about the kind of person he really was."
5,SINATRA TREASURES - A PERSONAL SCRAPBOOK,"I bought this book as a gift for my husband, who is an avid lifelong fan of Frank. He loves it, and so do I. It makes one feel like part of the family."
3,Just a clarification about Sinatra's last wife,"Just a clarification on one of the reviews here- Sinatra did NOT marry Harpo Marx's ""ex"" wife (Harpo remained married to his only wife Susan until death), he married another Marx Brother's wife, that being Barbara, who divorced Zeppo in order to marry Frank."
4,"The Sinatra Treasures: Intomate Photos, Mementos, and Music from the Sinatra Family Collection","I already owned this collection and purchased two for gifts. Since I enjoyed the collection so much, I thought it would be a great gift for two of my friends.Both arrived in excellent condition."
3,Timi Yuro - Live,"The third of the Liberty Records Timi Yuro catalog released on CD from the UK company RPM Records - and the first time this full album has been released in any format. Possibly not the greatest things ever cut by Miss Yuro - that had to be the 'Make The World Go Away' album - with the London recorded 'Something Bad on My Mind' a close second, but a live recording from 1969 never-the-less. Whilst not a good introduction to Timi - along with the other two RPM discs it does cover her time at Liberty (1961-1965 and 1968-1969) and sit comfortably with them. If you have them get this, if not try 'The Lost Voice of Soul' and/or 'The Voice That Got Away' first. I have tried to be un-biased in this review. Personally I have thought Timi Yuro the greatest US white soul singer since 1961, have everything she has ever recorded, and the woman can do no wrong for me."
2,"Good movie, bad DVD","The good news: the movie is a lot of fun, especially if you like the sort of postmodern musical that features improbable people breaking into song and dance in improbable places (think Everyone Says I Love You or Love's Labour's Lost). And those of you who don't speak Spanish will be happy to know that the English subtitles are well-done, and translate colloquially and with the correct amount of vulgarity.The bad news: the region 1 (US) DVD is missing a lot of things that were on the region 2 (Europe) version. They get deleted scenes, outtakes, making-of segments, TV commercials, and a picture gallery; all we get is the theatrical trailer. If you have a region-free player, you may want to get your hands on the version from Spain instead of this one."
5,A Great Movie from Spain!,"El Otro Lado de la Cama (Film Title in Spanish)I saw this movie in Valencia, Spain in the Summer of 2002. Actually, I saw it TWICE! It is really one of the funniest I have ever seen. I love to see a movie that intertwines the plot amongst the characters and this one does it perfectly. The musical numbers are awesome. They are not the greatest singers, but neither am I. Like another great musical that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year, you will find your self cheering for characters that are not the most ""upright"". Over all, it is just simply a great movie that all should see. I hope it is released in more cities here in the United States very soon."
4,I own it and I'm gonna buy it again,"I love this movie. It's a very fresh entertaingin musical comedy. I already own it but i'm going to order it again from Amazon because the DVD i have is Fullscreen and i hate Fullscree... it mutilates the image. N e ways, i really recomend this movie to all musical comedy lovers."
4,Buy the DVD version from Spain!!!,"Excellent movie, unfortunately this version appears to be a VHS transfer because the damn English subtitles can not be turned off..."
4,A musical twist for a nice light-spirited movie,"The musical twist of this film makes it kind of surrealistic and funny. The movie reflects a light-spirited and delicate sense of humor typical of post-Franco Spain. Acting is good and you feel that actors are enjoying and living their parts. By the way, It is funny that the guy from Guadalajara (Mexico) criticizes spanish sense of humor. Mexico is perhaps the country I know with the worse and coarser sense of humor ever. Just remember the horrible Cantiflas movies and the pathetic Chapulin Colorado!!!"
3,Too Many Drums and Bjork-esque style,"This is Eduardo, writing from Guayaquil, ECUADOR. (South America) Yesterday, when i got home i received ""My Favourite Game"" import cd, that i bought from Amazon.com. So, i listen it with all my expectations after reading the messages posted here in the mailing list. The first track: My Favourite Game- The best part of this song comes from the drummer of the band. Lyrics kind of bizarre. Type of Madonna's Erotic background. Music, sounds pretty the same as Portishead, with a Bjork-esque touch. I like it, but Lovefool was more an impact the first time i listened it. The second track: War (first try) - Outreageous and terrific lyrics. Very deep itself. I don't like the music background, specially those drums. The third track: War The best from this CD single. I love the part (i think it says this): ""...I loaded my gun with love..."" If someone could send me the lyrics of this song i'd really appreciate it! Well, that's all folks."
1,Westboro Baptist Church redux.,Repeating the same old nonsese from every hate-group in America is not original.Nothing one cant find on the Westboro Baptist Church website.
1,Clash of Orthodoxies,A serious subject addressed as a polemic. Selected quotes are set up as straw men and then attacked. Felt repetitive and unenlightening.
3,Lucky Bishops - self-titled (Rubric),"Looks to be this neo-psychedelic band's debut effort. Most notable tracks here are ""Stratosphere"", the acoustic ""Right Direction"", ""Open Gardens"" and ""Space: 1949"". Couldn't help but to notice this band's good harmony vocals. Line-up: Chas Dickie-cello, Luke Adams-drums, bells & vocals, Tom Hughes-flute, guitar & harmonica and Rich Murphy-guitar, trumpet & vocals. Certainly no masterpiece, you understand - but decent. Might appeal to fans of Apples In Stereo, The Gurus, Green Pajamas and Olivia Tremor Control."
2,Not what I was expecting,The Item came to me on time but it did not look like the picture. The picture was round the one I got was rectangular and its in a Tupperware-ish container with no cellophane wrap to let me know it had not been tampered with. And to me it just didn't look like 500 rubber bands so I counted it. There were 442 so the container was 68 rubber bands short. To me that's a lot since I payed for 500 and did not get it. Also there were a few broken and irregular rubber bands too some so thin they would easy break and others with the rubber melted together. (which I included in my count) so the superior quality on the box is also untrue. I don't know if that is the fault of the manufacturer or if the seller put less to make more money. Either way I will not be buying from this person/ or this brand again because of it. I will include pictures.
3,It is ok.,"It is ok. Hard to tell if it works. Thing is, if I use it daily, I'll run out in less than 2 weeks. So the costs can add up. Good for occasional use. Good to have one on hand just in case needed."
2,Rubber bands,"These bands are the exact size I needed; however, the inferior quality of the product renders a lot of them unusable. Some stretch out and won't contract back to the original size. What can you expect from a product made in China?"
4,Nice album from a jazz pioneer,"I just received a CD copy of this album yesterday from Japan. I've had an abridged MCA tape of this record for many years.Sampson was one of the leading arrangers in the Swing Era, best known for his work with Benny Goodman & Chick Webb. A quick look at the track listings will show some familar tunes that were hits for his employers. This band appears to be a group of NYC jazzmen that came together for this album. It is said that this is the ONLY time Edgar recorded under his own name. Sad, as I wish there were a few more albums in this vein.Audio quality is good for a 1956 recording date, just wish it were stereo. The CD reissue is packaged as a minature LP album release-the English cover notes will require a good magnifying glass to decipher; unless you can read the Japanese notes packed inside."
2,Basic Basic,"Mostly this is a ""Duh"" level book, about how to install programs that you will need to use in order to make games. The first half of the book talks about anything but making games, but rather the structures of a game company, tools needed and the likes of which anyone looking for information of entry level game making, is already going to know about. I found it very un-informative and there was little to nothing in the context of the book that helped me understand starting basic ground level game production in 3d. (of which this book ALSO covers about 50% on 2-d Gaming)Would not recommend to anyone with any gaming knowledge. Its THAT level of basic knowledge."
5,These are *good*,"I like these photos very much. I believe this is the first set of male nudes that I can say that of. They're really not eroticized, and they're not mythologized either. These are pictures of guys who are pretty comfortable in their bodies.And they're very fine pictures. I'm picky, especially about people pictures (which I've been trying to take myself for 30 years), and these work excellently for me. They're about the subjects, not primarily about the photographer. And they're all different.The fine *technical* quality of the photos and the printing of the book don't hurt a thing either.You should give these photos a try."
5,A Must Buy,"I walked the Camino de Santiago in the spring of 2005 and this book was the envy of all pilgrims I met along the way. Everyone who walks the camino had some type of guide that they carried along with them, but this one was the most comprehensive. It prepares the walker with all they need to know prior to beginning their pilgrimage as well as giving an overview (town expectations, alberque locations, and altitudes climbed). While I found that I differed occasionally on the review of the alberques along the way, I never felt lost or unprepared for the journey that was to lie ahead. Walk the camino -- you will love the difficult and challenging experience that will forever change the way you look at everything -- and make sure that this is the only book you take along with you."
2,Inaccurate with too much personal angst,I did not like this book as a guide to the camino although many may find it interesting to read before or after walking. Directions were vague and inaccurate in several spots. A couple of times I wondered if the author had ever even been there. Some spots were detailed too much and other sections were skipped over. Not a dependable directional guide.Very much about the author's personal journey with some interest from that perspective.
4,A decent Atari 2600 arcade port!,"Pole Position for the Atari 2600 is a decent arcade port! Graphics are decent for the Atari 2600. Sound effects and music are barely adequate. Controls take some getting used to but are pretty easy (in this version you are constantly moving...only controls are left to steer left, right to steer right, up to shift to high gear, down to shift to low gear, and the red fire button acts as your brakes). Gameplay is the same as the arcade classic. You get one track (Mt. Fuji), and the scoring table is the same as the arcade version. For the Atari 2600, Pole Position is a decent arcade port!"
2,POLE POSITION GOOD ARCADE BAD PORT,"I was not very amused by pole position on the Atari VCS(2600). I spent a while in a pizza place that had the arcade machine POLE POSITION that I really, really enjoyed. I thought Pole Position on the ATARI would be just like it, but I was wrong. I was feeling bad to...I really wanted to hear the intro song...hear my engine rev...the sound of the lights changing...and the explosions when I veered off road...but I didn't feel I got any of that with this game(POLO POSITION II for the Atari 7800 has all of this but is not an exact port of the arcade)."
4,Awesome and I would Recommend!!,"These worked as advertised! I still think the best ones are the Crown Skinless Condoms but I wanted to try these out just too see and yeah they make u last longer than usual. They didn't break or anything either so I will purchase these again but not for everyday use, my Crowns are for that, these will be if I need to be a superstar lololol Go Buy these4 Stars because nothing is perfect, I would have gave a 4 1/2 but no option"
1,"Money gone, smell and residue stay","Goo Gone is just a marketing hype, it did nothing to remove scotch residue. It smells horrible. I was stupid not to use gloves when applying the product. Afterwards I washed my hands several times with a scented soap, scrubbed them with baking soda, and rubbed in some lemon essential oil but I still can smell it. Goof Off Heavy Duty is a much better product."
3,No Miracle Worker,"I gave this a particularly tough assignment, I concede, but it was not very effective cleaning off a charcoal grill grate down to the metal. The grill had not been touched in five years.On the large grate, which was not coated so thickly, it got a few areas down to the metal with multiple applicatons. On the smaller grate, with a thicker coating of baked-in grease, it was almost useless. It worked fine on the grill itself, but that was not much of a test."
3,"Just okay, still had to scrub a lot.","This is the first time that Amazon reviewers have let me down! I had to take off the sticky residue left by some childproofing locks on my cabinets and stove. So I purchased this after reading the reviews. It did help a bit but was not the wonder that I thought it would be. I still had to use a plastic knife and scrubber pad to do most of the hard work. Goo Gone just got rid of the residue that was left.I will not purchase this again. If I ever need another residue/tape remover type product I will buy unisolve, I KNOW that works great and I'm kicking myself for not spending the extra money."
5,Best citrus solvent!,"Goo Gone continues to be the best citrus solvent product out there... hands down. No chemical smell... only pleasant citrus. And it works for all my solvent needs, both heavy duty and with delicate uses. Love it!"
2,Over-rated cleaner,Can't really say anything bad about it. Its just a so-so cleaner that requires a lot of elbow grease to get the desired results.
2,I used them to remove something stuck on my laptop but..,"Maybe I don't know how Goo Gone works however, for me is just smelly stuff that doesn't work properly. I put the goo gone for 10 minutes and try to wipe off with soap water towel however, it was still there."
3,"Well, it took out the gunk...","...but it also created a new stain. There was some sticky goo in one of our wooden drawers. Goo Gone took it after about 4 or 5 tries. However, now the wood looks like it has been stained with what looks like grease, possibly due to the Goo Gone. Let's just say we're not using that drawer too much anymore."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Was lured into buying this petroleum based product from the rave reviews who ever this company makes post positive reviews on various websites. Bought it to remove glue from bamboo flooring. For the money, you should be able to spray it on and watch the glue dissolve. If you fall for their sales pitch, be ready to use a lot of elbow grease and finger nails. Better off buying regular old mineral spirits at a lower price."
1,Doesn't Work,I bought this product to remove a sale price sticker from a mirror. Pretty easy task right? Wrong! This stuff created a bigger mess and had no effect on the goo.
5,AlmostFree,This product is really awesome and useful. I used it to clean sticker residue off my laptop. I was very pleased with the result and it did not fade the color. This is very handy product.
2,Goo Gone vs UN-DU,"Goo Gone did ok on removing most goo but left potent odor & stains sometimes. UN-DU seemed to use less to do the same jobs so the smaller bottle went just as far as goo gone bigger bottle. Also, UN-DU lets me reuse stickers & doesn't leave the stains/smell. UN-DU is better for me"
5,Goodbye Sticky Things,"Goo Gone. Smells like oranges. Guaranteed to remove any and all sticky residue you can find, except clingy girlfriends. 8 Oz. goes a long way."
3,"Not as effective as ""Goof Off"" on dried latex. I tried both at once.","I've have a bottle of each right now and I just picked a large spot -- about four inches across -- on my chest freezer lid that had dried latex paint. I put ""Goof Off"" on half and ""Goo Gone"" on the other half, making sure not to let the two run together. Ten minutes later I wiped both. The area where I used ""Goof Off"" is restored to new clean whiteness. The area where I used ""Goo Gone"" still has the latex paint, not degraded a bit.So, these types of products are not the same at all. Of course, the description of this product does not say it removes paint. Best just to stick with removing ""goo"" with this product."
2,Fred Meyer sells it for 1/2 the price ($4.99)...,"It is unusual to find stuff cheaper in stores than the prices I find on Amazon, but right after I got this I saw it in Fred Meyers for 1/2 the price.I came back home hopping to return it or get a price match, but it would cost me $5.60... Misses the point..Now I feel ""cheated"" and will definitely pay more attention at prices in other places before ordering from Amazon again.I know it's not an expensive item, but it's about the situation not the monetary value."
3,What stinks!?!,"You know that gross sticky mess left after you peel off a price tag sometimes? This gets rid of things like that, and just other oddly sticky messes.The problem though is that it just absolutely reeks of citrus. I know that's supposed to be a nice odor, but this is not... and if you close it and put it in a drawer or something the odor still leaks out of the cap stinking up your drawer."
4,"Works very well, but is big and bulky.","It fit my 2001 Honda Civic perfectly. The shade is big an bulky, making it difficult to roll up when not in use. It's a trade-off; superior ability to keep the sun out and stay in place, but more difficult to roll up. I would still buy this if I had to do it again."
4,"For the record, it's only 32 #1's","Just what chart did they use to come up with 41 #1's? According to Billboard they only have 32. Here are the songs which didn't quite make it to #1 - #2 How Do You Fall In Love (one of the new songs), #2 Here We Are, #4 Then Again, #2 Born Country, #3 Once Upon A Lifetime, #3 Hometown Honeymoon, #3 Give Me One More Shot, #2 She Ain't Your Ordinary Girl, #4 In Pictures, #2 Sad Looking Moon.This package was re-released under the title ""The Essential Alabama"", without making the 41 #1's claim."
3,Alabama is great. Edited versions of songs aren't great.,"When Alabama first came out, they were one of the few country acts to not only have a string of hit singles, but also have albums that you could listen and enjoy nearly every song. So many compilations have been issued featuring Alabama's best, but this is the first to encompass their entire career. I've always enjoyed Alabama, especially their early releases. What I don't enjoy is buying a $25 CD set and getting cut-up edited versions of songs. For instance, half the fiddle solo is cut out of ""Dixieland Delight"", the drum solo is cut out of ""Mountain Music"" and those are just a couple examples. I wish RCA would release a compilation featuring the versions that are on the original albums. That's how I remember the songs, that's how I want to hear them today."
2,"Too many dated, soft-rock country songs","These may have been hits at one time, but today they should be relegated to history. Many of the songs are uncomfortable mix of shmaltzy soft rock and country. A few gems of course (like ""Dixieland Delight) but probably not worth getting unless you're a diehard Alabama fan."
4,Good additional to ant collection.,"Although I'm not a big country fan I have enjoyed listening to Alabama songs over the years. So when they came out with this ""Greatest Hits"" CD (is this their 4th or 5th greatest hits package?) I decided I had to have it. Overall a wonderful story in and of itself, it takes the listener from their beginnings through today and even adds a couple of new tunes. The one thing that disappointed me though is when you hear all their hits, one after another, you begin to realize they tend to ""cookie-cut"" their songs for maximun appeal. Alabama rarely seems to take chances and you really can't blame them based on the success they've had. Being more of a rocker than a twanger I like the upbeat songs like Reckless and I'm in a Hurry. My wife however (who HATES country) actually fell in love with all the ballads. If you were to only buy 1 Alabama CD set, this would be the one."
3,Dated and Weird,"I bought this CD because it was mentioned in an interview of Gerard Allessandrini, the genius behind Forbidden Broadway (go get all of those CDs right now). 40+ years later the songs and the story for that matter just do not hold up. I don't think I have ever heard anything else that is locked into its time period (pre-assassination 60s) more than this is. People really thought this was witty and clever at the time but listening to it now it is just bizarre. ""I was a shoo-in, a shoo-in, a shoo-in winner from Mississippi back there were I come from"" is just cringe-making. But buy it anyway and see if you can listen to the whole thing front to back. I dare you."
5,They don't make'm like this anymore!,"I saw ""Subways"" on opening night.It is a shame that this show didn't make the cut. It was truly a terrific Broadway show. A great score, superb cast and a show that made you hum the score as you left the theatre.I would love to see a revival. Perhaps the audiences of today would appreciate what the critics of 1962 didn't. Considering buying it? You will pleased."
4,Great score!,"If you liked Bells are Ringing you will be thrilled with ""Subways"". This is classic Broadway musical. The music is better than the actual play."
2,Using this supplement to help memory problem,I have not seen any improvement in my memory yet. I take one a day at this time.Helene Markovitz
1,The Adventure Book of Rocks By Eva Knox Evans,"This book is old and this copy is acceptable, though starting to fall apart at the binding. Water marked and well read. Is simply written and easy to read, though pictures of rocks are black and white making it harder to identify them."
5,Packed with Information and Fun,"This books covers everything from history, local ways, language, money, infrastructure, hotels, restaurants, major sites, along with tons of photos and maps. Fascinating. Hard to put down. If you can't go to Prague, this is the next best thing.I lost my first one and need to replace it for our trip to Prague coming up next week. The book is small, 1/2"" thick, and will pack easily."
2,Eyewitness Travel Guide: Prague,"A great looking book that really gave me an idea of what I want to see if I visit Prague this year. This book is great if you want to find out what the ""must-sees"" in Prague are, but I think I would need another guidebook to tell me more specific info on the rates of hotels and a more complete accomodation list."
2,More a picturebook than a guidebook.,"When used with a regular guidebook, this helps you visualize the various sights of Prague, but it can overwhelm you with the sheer number of attractions. My biggestproblem with this guidebook series is the lack of opinions from the authors. One perk of Lonely Planet or similar guidebook is saying what is worth your time, this isn't worth your time. This museum has an English translation sheet.. this one doesn't. I find this helpful in selecting how to use my travel time wisely. So i wouldn't actualy recommend buying this book, but if you see in your local library or book store, its worth flipping through to see what Prague is all about."
4,Armchair travel plus,"The Eyewitness Travel series serves as a great visual introduction to a place. It allows you to ""see"" what places are like and plan your trip accordingly. The maps are usually great and the flaps of the book are constructed to serve as place markers. I bought this book after spending several months living in Prague after college. I had no money and didn't take many photos while I was there; I use this book to bring back memories. I now buy these books whenever there is one for my destination (I even have the one for my current home town).I wouldn't recommend the book as the soul guide for a budget traveller or someone who wants more than a one-page history on things. Yes, buy the book to plan places and sites to visit, but consult another source for cheap eats/accommodations (there is a selection of these) or detailed historical information."
4,Compact travel guide,"I had used the top 10 for Amsterdam. I find it easy to carry, to the point, and the maps come in handy."
5,Prague Travels,"This was the best travel book I ever have purchased. I had never been to Prague before, and we took a trip in October 1997, using this travel guide as our primary resource. I have to say that the history and walking/public transportation plans contained in the book made great advance reading, and the dining and lodging references were right on. This book is a major reason we had such a great trip. I will be purchasing this series in the future for other cities whenever we travel!"
4,Many photos of proteas,"A slim volume featuring photos of many proteas found in South Africa, about half in color. Each of the flowers shown is described in regards to cultivation and native habitat. Also includes a page of background on the plant and how it got its name. One of the books in the Pride of South Africa series."
1,Buyer Beware,"Beware! It might say 10 packages, but you'll only get one!! Don't expect to get the other 9 anytime soon. I tried that and all they said was ""oops. Sorry we're all out of that product, can I interest you in something else?"" So stupid. If I wanted something else I would have bought something else."
1,disappointed,"The ""ad"" for the product said a package of 12 ice creams. I received one.Not happy about that but too frustrating to try to track down the seller, fight with him/her and just gave up.So upsetting."
2,Pianissimo,It is so different from all his other work and hardly any piano. If you like the combination of a banjo and tuba you'll love it.
4,"So far, so good.","I installed these rotors with Akebono ProACT pads on a 2008 Acura TSX. It's a daily driver, and these parts seem to perform as well as the original OEM parts - quiet, smooth braking. The black coating provides a nice cosmetic appearance with alloy rims. Hopefully, the finish will survive at least one winter with road salt.Like the OEM rotor, this rotor has the holes for the two assembly screws and the two bolts (M8 with a 1.25-mm pitch) that can be used for releasing a stuck rotor from the hub if need be.If you're in doubt about the fit to your vehicle, the part numbers can be double-checked using the vehicle lookup function on Raybestos' website."
3,children karaoke dvd,"My child loves it. Wants to play it all the time. It has one song on it ""ALOUETTE(L,ALOUETTE) that is not played in English . Why they put this in there is a wonder. king of stupid I think. They need more VOLUMES. Like 2# 3# 4# 5# This is the only childrens Karaoke dvd I can find any were. If any one know of any other childrens karaoke dvd e-mail me please. Thanks"
3,"Not for a person who loves action, But a good read.","Michael Patrick Kelly, a boy who steals to feed his family, is actually a very good kid. He would shine the customer (or victim's) shoes and then pick their pocket. However, he is caught, and sentenced to five years at Tombs prison- or to be sent west to start a new life. He goes west. And that, my friend, is how everything begins. Everyone of his siblings gets good parents- except him. Hans Friedrich, a rather bulky,er, really bulky man with a temper like a bomb- ready to go off. Gunter Friedrich, a 13 year old who hates Mike and is always trying to get him into trouble. And he does,too. Mrs. Friedrich is a lovely and nice cook. The maid, Marta,is in love with a rowdy boy-who loves her back! And Rueben-the hired hand is Mike's best friend. But when Reuben suddenly disapears, and a freshly dug plot of dirt turns up that day, Mike has a creeping suspicion of Mr.Friedrich, and if he will be next..."
1,Marginal quality-not a good product for the price.,"This work is little more than an expanded brochure, with far too little detail concerning the types and varieties of dice available to the collector. It looks formula-written, with way too many poorly reproduced photographs of casino postcards. Certainly not worth the price tag. The front cover depicting a pair of dice, with one die showing two sides with four pips, (not exactly something you are going to see when collecting casino dice), is an appropriate warning for this book."
2,Good design but...,This product is designed well but is too big for a 4-cup percolator basket. I thought it would fit all percolators.
1,Deceptive Packaging,"I was disappointed when I opened the package, these Filters are not like the picture on the package,They are NOT round as depicted on the package , they DO have the hole perforated on the tip of the corner , They are about 9"" x 9"" square with a hole in the middle , They DO function to filter the grounds from the coffee basket, BUT They ARE NOT, a pre molded round as shown on the package. You do have to have to make the small effort to fit a square filter to a round basket, ,SO for no other reason I give it ""1 STAR "" ratting for MELITTA packaging it this way."
4,"Good product, but pricey","Filters are a must for percolators, but this brand can be a little pricey. I suggest looking around for store brands in super markets because I have and it is the same quality. If you do want to buy this brand, it is a good product and it will work well for the percolator so I suggest going straight for the bulk package so you won't have to worry about running out."
2,Forgettable,I've read most of McBain's 87th Precinct series and it's a pity that he didn't stick with those tried and true characters. This ho hum book doesn't inspire any loyalty or affinity for the characters other than the victim's husband--he's the only one with any humanity and only a minor character at that.
3,Book Review,Read parts of this from a book borrowed from the Library and wanted to own this book and have a copy in my personal library
5,Great Deal,"First, I emailed the company because the picture they had on the site was different than what they were selling, so I emailed them, and they emailed me back about 10 min later, fixed the picutre, I bought the stuff (at a cheap price) and my wife loves it. Would recommend to anyone."
5,A spa experience in your own shower,Paul Mitchell hair products are wonderful; I have been using them for over 35 years with excellent results. The shampoo lather is luxurious; the scent delightful and the conditioner effective and silky. I am a loyal PM customer!!
5,Great bowl !,"I am very pleased with this bowl and the other matching bowls I purchased! The 1 quart bowl is light in weight, stacks in the cabinet easily plus it is easy to clean! Large size is good for serving more than one person if those eating do not have large appetites... here it is enough for one person who is hungry and fills it up twice... the main reason for the purchase!"
5,"Corelle 1-quart Serving Bowl, Sandstone","This Corelle (Sandstone pattern) 1-quart serving bowl is perfect for serving a salad or family style side dish. Lightweight and easy to handle. Has the Corelle durability, too."
2,Need more resources than just this,"In comparing the review books, you are given the impression that this is all you need to review. Therefore I chose this because of all the high reviews. If you are taking the ANCC FNP exam, I suggest you purchase other resources. Many of the review books, including this one, don't cover professional roles & policies, NP/pt relationship & research. It is very difficult to find a review book that has all topics thoroughly covered. Even ANCC's review manual does not completely cover what is on their test. Don't be misled into thinking this one review book will do it all for you."
5,nice,I have bought several of these to keep updated and even gave my mom one. sums diagnoses up well and very informative. life safer
2,Outdated resource,I am presently reviewing to take my national certification and found that this book is very outdated. I would not use this book due to it was written in 2005.
5,You cant pass the test without it!!!,Amazingly well put together!! A must before taking the NP exam!!
4,NP exam review book,"A good resource for preparing for the AANP FNP certification exam.Pros: detailed information on a range of content, hitting all the systems plus health promo and disease prevention.Cons: each set of questions is organized by system; there is no practice exam offered with questions randomly distributed. It would be helpful to also find a book with a higher number of practice questions and less content."
4,Great Study Guide,I am in Nurse Practitioner School and I am using this book as an add'l study tool. So far it has been helpful and Iwould recommend it to anyone.
1,disappointed,"I recently bought this book for a review and was very disappointed that I found there was sometimes conflicting data and the setup of the questions before the material was less helpful. Although her review courses have a great reputation, I would forgo this book and get another."
5,"Truly a ""Pocket"" Bible","This mini bible is now out of print. I bought the Burgandy bonded leather with snap closure through Amazon for a total of $26; what a deal since it's now a rare edition. I just received it 2 days ago and I love it! I'm 24 yrs old and the font is not too tiny for me. I can read it morning, noon and night with it sitting on my lap or at arm's length without trouble. This will literally fit in any coat pocket, it's not thick and the length of it is shorter than my hand. I wanted a bible I could carry around EVERYWHERE -- and this is sturdy. I love the NASB translation as it stays true to the Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek as much as possible. Jesus' spoken words are in red and all references to God are capitolized (i.e. the words ""He, His, My, Me"" etc), no footnotes or middle reference column and each book in the bible does not start on a new page - it's continuous. I posted a picture that provides an idea of the actual size."
3,No Zipper Dudes! But a great handy Bible.,"I bought this based on a person's review in Amazon which said it was encased in a nice zippered pouch. It's not. He's getting it confused with Amazon item #0529101297, ""Smallest Pocket Bible"". I've purchased several of those (make great graduation or missionary gifts) for only about $3.00 more It's bascially the same Bible as this, but it comes fully encased in a zippered leather case. Travels better. It's NASB as well."
3,Not for any eyes over thirty,This is nicely made but the font is SO small that I can't read it even with my glasses on.
4,"Great for occasional reference, but not for quality reading.","I bought this a while back. Size-wise, it's perfect! It was more portable than I thought. But the font just didn't cut it for me. It's good if you want to pull out some verses when you're talking with people or something, but not good if you want to use it as a portable bible to read while waiting for a bus or something. It's just hard to concentrate on such small print for longer periods of time. Otherwise, it's a very cute edition and does make a great gift for those who have just come to faith! I ended up giving it to my friend and she loved it!"
2,Save your money,"This purchase was annoying. This water bottle is overpriced because it is no different than the 2 others I bought for much less, which I have used for years from the local drugstore. It stays warm for maybe 2 hours. The only thing that was nice about it is that there is very little plastic odor. It was a waste of money. I used it seven times and every night it was the same. I kept it fully covered under the blankets and made sure the water was piping hot - never boiled. I always prep the bottle with hot water a few times to warm the rubber before giving it the last fill. This hot water bottle is cheap and quite disappointing. I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews."
5,Wonderfully Haunting,"I have been really into M*A*S*H lately, and I wanted to hear the words. I came across their version, and fell in love with all of the music. I love it."
2,Too Cheeky,"Two of my all time favorite albums are Keren Ann's ""Not Going Anywhere"" and ""Nolita."" Everything after Nolita has been a BIG disappointment. Sorry, that's just the way I hear it.Lady & Bird has no soul, no rhythm, and is just bland and repetitive. It's weird too as others have mentioned, not that I don't like weird stuff, but this weird in a bad way. Too much special effects and not enough music. Not enough Keren Ann. Too cute and cheeky. I don't like it!!!Though it's non of my business, I think Lady should dump Bird and get back to her roots. I still think I'll risk ordering her ""Keren Ann 101"" that just came out. I hope it's a good'n.John"
2,"Stay with the Lady, lose the Bird","I accidentally stumbled upon Karen Ann about 2004 (or maybe because of a New Yorker article about her?). Nevertheless, I was enchanted by her songs and voice and unique style. When I lived in Chicago, I had the opportunity to attend her shows at three diverse venues. Each was a great pleasure. After her 1st three solo records, I became curious about this ""Lady & Bird"" thing.I was much dissappointed in comparison with what I had previously heard. Not to say it was bad, but just sort of lame in comparison (Blue Skies being the possible exception). I have just now noticed that there is a new L&B; record. It might be better as it contains about a half dozen songs, versions of songs from previous Keren Ann records."
5,Best kid's science book I've ever encountered.,"I love science and read a lot of adult science books. My son, 7, is really into science too - so we run through a lot of kid's science books. I've never encountered a better one than this one. ""How Come?"" never condescends and it never cuts corners in its explanations. It focuses in with razor sharpness on the questions and issues kids (and childlike minds) have and then answers them with clear and rational explanations that really inform and educate. I find myself reading this book and learning things - even on topics I'd covered many times before. I'd say that the age this book is pitched for is 8-14, but even smaller kids get something out of it - and few adults can resist it either."
2,repettitve,I was disappointed in this yoga dvd. Two of the routines were identical as in the same routine under two separate subheadings. The warmup and cool down were idnetical on at least three of the workouts. The stretches were well explained. I liked that there were two versions of each exercise. The stetch and the modified version. I would only reccommend this dvd for someone who has never tried yoga.
3,Probably great for beginners,I've been doing yoga only for 4 months - but already found this too basic.
1,Beyond Boring and Useless,I have piriformis/sciatica back pain and bought this CD with hopes of finding some relief. I am a long term yoga practicioner and truly found this tape to be awful. The quality of the sound and the amateuristic editing techniques were both annoying and distracting.The web description implied a different level of yoga therapy and did not come near living up to the promise. I literally did one 17 min segment and could not wait to send it back. The 17min is probably equal to more like 10 min of poses and instruction. It is a truly hyped product and I returned it. I will probably buy another one with a different more stimulating and professional presentation.I have purchased a Gary Kraskow and Rodney Yee CD as well and found them to be far superior.
5,Good DVD to use when you're in pain!,"I ""throw"" my back out every couple of months, and when I do, I can't walk, sit, lay down, etc. for at least a week!I really like this dvd, because even though the exercises are very easy, it's about all I can do when I'm in pain.It's very relaxing, and the exercises and stretches feel so good."
5,bad back heaven!,"Have had a bad back for to many years to count. Have had two surgery's in 9 months and this dvd has helped me recover quickly. Every time my physical therapist gives me a new exercise, I can say I already do it, because it's part of the tape. A++"
2,A let down,"What a let down. I have spinal injuries & was very excited that there was a video made especially for that. This video is seperated into several different 'workouts' but the truth is, she taped each move once & justs cuts the same video clips in different orders into the session... feels like more time is spent transitioning video clips than actually stretching. There's really only about 3 moves in each 15 minutes. I didn't feel like I'd accomplished anything at all after doing the video's."
5,Incredible beautiful sounds,"I've had a copy of this on cassette since 1990, and never had any song titles only the name Shankar. I've searched and searched since then to avail to find out the album title. Only now have I found out. A part of me can rest in peace!On to the music however. This blew me away when I first heard and it continues to do so. I find it perfect to listen to when falling asleep. Each track is simply astounding, with an almost ""happy"" and uplifting feel to many of the songs.A must-have purchase if you're a fan of ""World Music"""
5,The defacto solution as far as I can tell,"A dirty stylus IS a problem. In the days of records, most people probably never considered the issue. It didn't really matter. Nowadays, hobbyists like myself are RECORDING their beloved songs to digital for posterity. I use 24/96 for most of my recordings. If I'm going to be recording at such a sensitive setting, listening to the same digital file over and over forever, I want the cleanest signal possible. I GruvGlide the record, let it dry, then clean my stylus and let it dry. This is provides the cleanest, slickest mechanical environment for the needle riding along a groove. There are a lot of short run designer specialty fluids out there, but this is made by Stanton for the masses. In this case, mass production equals value."
5,New Years Eve Punch [European version ],"I agree with the reviewer from Virginia Beach [Wayne E. Davis],the European version rates 5 stars. The female group Bond [very talented & sexy ladies] along with the singing of Russell Watson makes this DVD very special. Also Andre's 3 singers [Suzan, Carla & Carmen] do a song from a Chinese opera called ""Im Salon zur blauen Pagode"" which will bring a smile to your face.As for the American version I have yet to see it, but after Mr Davis write up, I'll pass on it."
4,andre rieu,good dvd thought it could have been longer like a lot of andre other dvd's. still very good
5,Outstanding!!!,"I have purchased 5 Andre Rieu dvd's and New Year's In Vienna is one of the best. The music gets the crowd into it early and often. The music selection is great and very entertaining. I have watched this dvd 20 times in the first month i have owned it, and it is still a great entertainment. i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Andre and his orchestra."
3,poor batteries,the batteries don't hold much of a charge but it is bright. But it needs better batteries. I wouldn't buy again
2,Nice when it works,"Solid construction, bright light. However after a handful of time of limited usage, the battery goes. It will go on for a minute then flare out.Now I am trying to replace the battery, which so far is difficult to find. So it remains useless sitting on my workbench until I have time to spend looking for a battery.In hind sight it was inexpensive, but given my time to (hopefully) fix it, not worth it. I should have spent more to have something dependable."
2,Cyclops Halogen Spotlight,"We were a little surprised when this Spotlight arrived. We were not expecting such a huge light. We would have liked something a little smaller in size. The light is nice and bright, but I don't think it holds a charge very long. I don't think I would recommend this to a friend."
2,Giant Black Hole! Will try again...,"First off, the yellow version is the most current. Not sure why people think the black one is newer. If you visit the official company's website, you see the yellow as the most current.I'm very dissapointed in the light. Mine has a HUGE black hole in the middle when it's on. It's pretty much useless over 20 feet. Much like a couple other people who reported the same thing. I emailed the company and they explicitly said it was not normal, so I'm willing to give it a second chance.From Cyclops Support:Thank you for taking the time to write! The issue that you are describing with your spotlight is not normal. I suggest you return the lamp for a replacement unit."
1,Don't Buy It From Cyclops,"I purchased this light from the Cyclops web site on December 4th, 2009. Today is December 20th,2009 and I have yet to receive my light. Have emailed them twice to find out the status of my order. Absolutely no response whatever. Going to call them tomorrow. It would appear that if you are one of the fortunate(?) ones who purchase and actually receive this light you may be very disappointed if you ever need to replace or repair one based on the experience I've had. That's why I came to THIS site. To purchase a light from a company that will actually send it to me after I pay for it. Cyclops is, in my mind, a company that truly represents the old addage ""Buyer Beware"". This is in no way a reflection on Amazon.com. It's merely a warning about what to expect when dealing with Cyclops."
1,Going Back - Received Yellow and Black Instead of Black,"I ordered this light because of the handle stand as depicted in the Amazon.com photo and the black finish. I received an older model prior to the redesign that is yellow and black. I'm returning this light. Bright or not, I wouldn't have ordered what I received."
1,DOA! Another piece of landfill fodder.,"The product was DOA. It is a big piece of yellow plastic that is destined for the landfill. I wish that companies built things to last--sigh--ah for the good old days. Even if the product had worked out of the box, I wonder if it would have lasted for more than one year?Amazon was very good about refunding my money, but we decided to buy local next time. My husband went to the Cabela's store and bought a similar product . . . brought it home and it came broken out of the box!!!!! This one is a big piece of bright green landfill fodder. We are still looking for a light that works!"
2,Pretty Disappointing,"Long ago I purchased a similar spotlight rated at 500,000 (1/2 million) candlepower. This one is rated at 2.5 million candlepower by the manufacturer, but is nowhere near as bright as the old unit. I guess the definition of a candlepower has changed (grin).This unit has an on/off switch. I also preferred the old unit's trigger switch, which allowed easy momentary use. The trigger could also be locked for continuous use. With this one, momentary use is really not possible.The unit I received does not look like the picture. The one I received has one moveable support on the bottom, which can be placed in four positions to allow various upwards angles when the light is placed on the ground. It also has a ""pistol"" grip which swings up from the carry handle. This is supposed to allow you to use ""pinpoint aiming"" when holding the unit upside-down with the grip. Big deal. Leave out the grip and add more candlepower, please.I did not give it only one star because it does work.-dan z-"
1,Cyclops Halogen Spotlight,"I purchased this from Amazon for my husband for Christmas. My husband had it on his Christmas list. He used this flashlight one time and then would not work!!! We were VERY disappointed that it did not last. We had to pay $10 shipping back to get another flashlight. I don't think I will ever purchase something from Amazon, because it is a pain in the butt to return and more out of pocket money."
1,Item not as described,Like the other reviewer I did not receive the item in the picture. The one I received seemed to be of a lower build quality and was a different product altogether. Thankfully Amazon is good with returns of this nature--I bought the 20 million candle power light and haven't had second thoughts.
1,Piece of crap,"Used for a week after initial charge but the thing went completely dead after 1st recharge--I did not overcharge it--opened it up to look for loose connections, all looked good--but the damn thing is dead--well, you get what you pay for I guess--spend a little more for a Coleman or Brinkman..."
2,Not a good life,Prosit worksconsBattery only lasts like 10 minutes maybe.cars must be running for the car plug to work.cables are not long enough.
3,Product not as great as I had beleived.,"Doesn't keep a charge for very long. It O.K. but don't expect an hour of use out of it, or you want be happy."
3,Bright,"It Is bright, but it doesnt seem to hold the charge very long, guess it would be good if you had it plugged in and it was stationary. We have had it for 2 years and is not working at all now. It gets a little bulky if you intend to carry it around which we had bought that for."
4,Cyclops CYC-S6X Thor X Scout 6.5 Million Candle Power Rechargeable,"Fast shipping, product was as described but wish it had a light that went off when it is charged. This was a birthday gift and my friend is very happy with it."
1,"Junk item, don't buy.","First, I bought the unit in this picture and as it clearly says on the side of the unit it's a 15 million candle unit, not 2.5 million which the title states.This is one of the worst products I've ever purchased and want my money back.The main switch didn't last even two months before failing. Now I'm stuck with a brand new flashlight that does not work and no where to buy parts for it.Do yourself a big favor and move on to the next company."
1,Peice of junk!!!!,This is big waste of money. Sure it's bright but will only last about 20 minutes. No charge indicater. mine lasted 6 months with minimal use. Did not leave it pluged in to recharge except when I needed to use it.. Went to use and pluged in to recharge and now it won't work. Cannot get a hold of company to find out what is wrong. Bulb is fine . Battery sucks.
1,POS,I purchased this item and used it a few times. After a few times of minimal use the product still looks brand new. i charged it just like the directions said and now only using the product under 10 times the light will not even work. The bulb is fine terminals are fine so ive determined the battery must be junk. I will never by this braND OF lantern again!
1,Not For Emergency Preparedness,"I've had the same problem as many others that have reviewed this product. My main gripe is that you charge it for 8 hours at least, and you get 5 minutes of light. We got this as a gift for emergency preparedness in case the power goes out, and a candle is more useful than this piece of crap. Not worth your money. I found the battery online, and it costs 23 dollars at least. That's almost as much as the flashlight itself. Stay away people. I don't know how this company stays in business."
4,Good value for a halogen rechargable,"At first, I was skeptical on this spotlight, reading all the reviews of the weight being overwhelming and battery being a piece of garbage after a few weeks. However, I don't know if I was one of the lucky ones, but I found this to be very handy.The weight of it can get annoying, so don't expect it would be easy to sprint and carry this at the same time. As far as the battery goes, if you care about it, don't overcharge it, and use the spotlight about every week or so, you shouldn't have any problems, or at least I didn't :).I recommend it to anyone who uses the product regularly and cares about it. However, if you're not too sure about the quality on this product (semi-sturdy plastic non-reinforced is okay, not perfect, for me), get a higher priced product, or flashlights from Surefire, Inova, Maglite, Pelican, and others."
4,spotlight,"i'm pleased with the light , its not a real spot light , i think its a floodspot light and very very bright and seems to be holding the battery charge good..."
3,"Nice BUT really, really big.","This spotlight is HUGE. Much bigger than I wanted or expected. Nevertheless, Ikept it anyway since it's a great price and so far I've had no problems."
4,"Amazing, beautiful, unique, pretty! with a dash of hardcore","Wow. I work in a CD store and i came across this CD just becos of the interesting and very elegant cd cover. i put it in the cd player and was introduced to beatiful, alternative metal with amazing use of keyboards!its hard to define these guys, what with hints of APC, Tool, Mudvayne, Katatonia, etc. you see the dilemma!?! But, there are no hardcore death beltching, just amazing singing (whispering, shouting, talking, clean)This swede band is very very talented. Haha, even elements of Rammstein come up! i highly highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes slightly darker elements to their music and likes apc, tool, etc.Brilliant!"
1,Not so good,I bought this product with the hope that it would rival the Pomegranate Jelly my Mom's neighbor made from her home grown and harvested pomegranates. It wasn't even close. This jelly had no pomegranate flavor at all. It tasted like sugar jelly.
1,Difficult to Assemble,Did not like this product. Difficult to get assembled and would not stay assembled! The plastic discs are flimsy and would not hold cubes together. I would not recommend.
1,An unstable piece of junk,"Each side of the cube needs to be attached to the others using these little, junky plastic pieces that just don't hold together. I spent an hour wrestling with this, and then gave up. This is a poorly designed piece of junk. The pieces are supposed to ""snap together"". I could never get more than three pieces to snap together before another piece snapped off."
3,Rip off,"Do NOT buy these online. Yes, they do exactly as they say, but you can get them at any store for so much cheaper. I went to K-mart and found these for $19.99 and you get either 20 or 22 in the box, I can't remember. I use them for C&C cages for my guinea pigs and rabbits, and it's so much cheaper if you look around in the stores first."
4,Good storage cubes.,I gave these storage cubes a 4 star because they great for a quick temporary set up and the reason I am stating temporary is because the plastic devices that are used to connect the cubes together tend to break if you store anything on the cubes that weighs more than a couple of pounds. I think they are perfect for clothes and light weight items. They are large enough to store a considerable amount of clothes and other light weight items.
3,Nice product but poor connectors,"I find those cubes useful to optimize the space. However, it wouldn't hurt importing the connectors. I had to use cable ties in order to stabilize the structure (I've just noticed that Valerie Fletcher advises to do the same in her comment)."
5,Organized with Whitmor Colored Storage Cubes,"Very happy with my new storage cubes! I had a pile of computer stuff just stacked on the floor next to my desk, including all my tools that I use to work on computers. Decided it was high time to get this pile of stuff organized, so ordered the cubes. They are a little dicey to put together (keep coming undone while you're putting in the fourth side), but once together, they were solid and stable enough to hold all my computer junk. Instead of scrabbling through the pile of junk on the floor, I now just reach over to the appropriate cube and grab what I need. Couldn't be happier! :-)"
4,colorful storage cubes,"I purchased these to use for displaying decor items from overseas travels in a room that needed something light and colorful rather than heavy bookshelves. I also wanted to accent the room with the colors of Brazil and this was perfect. I did not use the red pieces. They turned out just as I pictured and I was able to simply wire the pieces together rather than use the connectors which would have detracted from the overall look. I have seven sets made from 8 pieces each placed around the room so I have a lot more display space then I would have had with traditional shelving. This would not work for heavy items but is perfect for my small framed photos, miniature boats and other hand-made items from Brazil."
5,Great for sore knees!,"My husband has soccer injuries, in particular, his knees. Before we walk our 5 miles on Saturdays, I mix 2 teaspoons msm powder & 2 Walmart brand Grape fitness powder packs ($1.74)to 4 oz water (8 oz in the summer) or Propel Zero Raspberry Lemonade Water Beverage Powder Mix. Both take the bitterness out.30 min before we start, we drink this mixture;* energy is great* barely noticeable to no pain during & after the 5 miles.He loves it and won't leave home without it!"
5,Love this!,I see a big difference when I started taking this. Especially my nails for some reason it made my nails grow and they're super strong!
5,MSM,"I received this last night and just started on it today. I hate tummy trouble, so I started off with only 1/4 t. in my morning smoothie. So far, so good! I'll put in 1/2 t. tomorrow, and keep upping the dose.Well packaged, speedy shipping - I will buy from this seller again!"
5,An out of this world treat.,"I saw this item and it brought back memories of my childhood visits to the science and industry museum, so I decided to order a pack of it. It arrived before the expected arrival time and was just as delicious as I remembered it. A definite recommended buy."
5,Mmmmmmmm,"This is awesome. It tastes like the fake marshmallows they put in immoral breakfast cereal, but instead of just tasting like sugar it tastes like fat as well. I can't believe I never tried this stuff until now, but I am definitely going to keep a stack of these in my desk.Disclosure:1. Your block of ""ice cream"" WILL be broken into a bunch of smaller chunks. It is so brittle that they probably all end up like that (this was the first one I ate, but one reason I passed on this stuff so many times is because I could tell by picking up the package that they were always broken).2. Partly for the above reason, astronauts don't actually eat this stuff any more. Wikipedia says it was used on one mission and was found to be inconvenient. Also, they have a freezer on the space station and just eat real ice cream.In spite of those facts, this stuff is delicious."
3,Tasty but way too pricey,"The individual packages contain a 0.7 oz. block of ice cream, making it $3.14 per oz. The stuff is fun and tasty, but definitely a once-only treat!"
4,Just what I ordered.,"I wanted something appropriate for a space-themed raffle prize and this filled the bill nicely. The shipping took a bit longer than I expected but it arrived in time and considering that the East Coast was still recovering from Hurricane Sandy, the seller did quite well.I never did see who won the raffle prize so I have no feedback on this particular batch, but I've had freeze-dried ice cream before and loved it so I'm betting it went over well. It felt like the ""bricks"" inside the pouches were broken but they always are so that wasn't an issue. Someday I will order this again and eat it all myself."
3,"Item good, Service NOT good.","Would have been a perfect review except that I ordered 2 boxes of 10 for a birthday party and was shorted one package. I mean, how hard is it to count to 20? Good thing one child didn't show up or they would have been very disappointed. Just like I am..."
2,Arrived smashed to pieces,"It tastes great, but I gotta wonder if the Amazon.com distributors took a sledgehammer to it before putting it in the boxes to ship it (or maybe they don't know how to ship stuff). It's a shame, given how hard this is to get in stores."
3,Mine arrived all crushed!,"The ice cream was an amusing part of my daughter's space themed birthday party treats, but almost every package was full of crumbled, crushed powdery mess. I was disappointed, but not by the quality of the product - just its fragility."
5,Yummy!,"I take these on the go all the time. Especially to the movie theater! Its ice cream, minus the mess!"
5,Awesome light weigh snack!,"I bought these for a lightweight backpacking snack. From what I remembered as a kid they are very tasty, and I was not disappointed! I've read other reviews complain about they come broken apart - but that's normal/acceptable - it in no way effects the quality of this product. The packaging of this is bulky - almost 0.4oz per! Luckily this product stays fresh in just a ziplock bag for at least a week. I put most of these in a gallon ziplock and saved several ounces in weight over ditching the stock packaging material. Gave some to my son and he loved them as well - they make a great/unique gift to kids."
3,Novelty food is not always novel food,"This kind of tastes like ice cream. Unfortunately the similarities end there.The creamy texture that makes REAL ice cream feel good in your mouth must have been sucked out of the package along with the moisture back at the factory.Biting down on this stuff is like biting into a hardened piece of neopolitan-flavored insulating foam. I found it to be a pretty gross sensation and had a hard time finishing the bar.Still, it's worth trying once!"
4,"Travelpro walkabout suiter, crimson","I love the lightweight aspect of this piece and also the color. I wanted a color that wasn't so difficult to spot in baggage claim. I always remove all interior features to make more room and even less weight and this was easily done. At this moment I am desperate to find the kind of cleaner Travelpro would recommend for the fabric of the luggage, one that won't circle or leave residue. After one trip via United the piece is soiled very badly and looks terrible. Please respond to this evaluation, if possible, with suggestions for cleaning the luggage."
2,Very Misleading Title,"Fortune 500 HR executives do in fact give tips for resumes and cover letters in this book. But if they possess the magic key to getting an interview, they don't share it. Readers won't get the interview everytime because the advice is tired and common: list your experiences and education on your resume; attach a cover letter. Basic online job hunting tips have been layered on top to make the advice seem fresh. It's not. And if it worked, there wouldn't be any need for newer strategies such as the ""accomplishment"" strategy (at least you prove that you were useful to a business) and the ""self-marketing"" strategy (much more aligned with a business's needs). As an employer, I want to know what a candidate will do to bring profit to my business and peace of mind to me. It's that simple. I don't want to infer or guess. And, contrary to what this book implies, I am more receptive to candidates who show initiative and creativity."
3,Not really useful,"The books listed some common information you could get on some websites. This book is too general, it has to be more detailed. For example, in the chapter of interview, it told you you have to prepare for questions recuritors will ask and listed around 20 sample questions there. However, it didn't give you any sample answer even a guideline to answer these questions.This book started with a real great idea but ended in a poor execution. The author did a survey to furtune top 500 companies. However, she didn't present those data she collected well.My suggestion is if you never know how to find a job and you don't like to do research on google, this could be your first guidebook."
5,Excellent Resource,This book was very well done. There are many sample resumes in the back and also sample cover letters. The content of the book explained what to put on your resume and cover letter and what employers are looking for. This is a great resource for anyone looking for some guidance on how to develop their resume and cover letter.
3,Cute shoe but narrow,"I really liked this shoe and it was perfect for a wedding I was in, but it was too narrow and I had to avoid them after the ceremony in lieu of flip-flops.Overall a pretty shoe, good price and sturdy heel, but narrow in the toebox."
4,Beautiful Shoes! Used as bridesmaid shoes!!!,Bought these shoes to wear in a wedding as the maid of honor. They matched my dress perfect and they are beautiful! I wore them for majority of the night so they are pretty comfortable! I wear a 7.5 and they are true to size!
4,vortex storm jacket,"The storm jacket works great and is worth the money to protect your investment. It fits well and is easy to use, I have a Nikon D60 and am very happy with this product it keeps your camera dry from the elements."
5,Works as Advertised,"The Vortex Media Storm Jacket Cover works as designed. It is a functional item that always occupies a place in my camera bag, ready to protect my valuable cameras when the elements get bad."
2,just commenting on the reviews I have read about this product.,"Thank You to all the reviews on this product, For I have not tried this perfume but really want to but after reading all the negativity from more than one review, I have changed my mind and I will directly buy from the consumer it'll be more expensive I'm sure but at least I will get to try the ""Correct Product"". So thanks to Amazon for having this review part of the site for others to view before purchasing items."
5,Abercrombie!,I first heard John Abercrombie's TIMELESS. It totally wrecked me. It is too short at 11 minutes.This offering is just as good. Ether-reggae is a gas. Nice set of quality recording from ECM.Enjoying ECM label and Fantasy label at the moment.
4,Classic ECM,"Everyone is on fire on this CD. This is one of my favorite Jack DeJohnette recordings along with ""Timeless"" in this period of ECM. Great great combination of DeJohnette/Abercrombie/Brecker and Jan Hammer.May sound dated to some ears, but there are beautiful compsitions and the playing is amazing!"
2,Book okay but binding stinks,"My husband really wanted this book for christmas based on some TV show interview he watched but after reading the review about the binding, I went to a local bookstore to check it out for myself. All FOUR copies had binding problems. When I opened the book, the pages started to break off so the store is returning them all.I am quite disappointed because it looks like a really good book content wise. Hope they get a new printing soon."
1,Publisher's Fault,"BEWARE!! I bought this book at Borders, then got in a line for Willis Reed to sign it. While waiting, I turned the pages back & forth a few times - it's a photo book primarily - and the pages began to fall out. I exchanged it for another, and those pages began to fall out. I paged through five more books, and their pages began to fall out, so I got my money back & didn't buy it. The store management said they were aware of the problem. The binding is so horrible that if you use it as it's intended - to look through over & over again - the pages will fall out (at least in all the books shipped to that Borders). It would have been especially horrible to give as a gift - not worth the money! A book is supposed to stay as a book."
4,Gets the job done,"I bought this to get the door panels and trim off my car, to change out the speakers and the cd player. Works good, popped off all the panels I needed off."
3,Little ways above fair,Garbarek was venturing into ambient-driven territory- which can account for somewhat sterile solos- but still had plenty of energy left here; Frisell in particular makes sure things stay layered.
2,cheap,cheap isn't always a good thing.these are no good on pavement not sure what they were supposed to be used on.
5,capt william t wawn's reveiw,"This long out of print classic deals with australian history that is defenately not taught in aussie schools to my knowledge...The blackbirders (wich captain wawn was one) sailed the pacific in the late 1800s, well after usa civil war abolished slavery,in search of island recruits (savage cannables) to work on queensland sugar plantations,(a musket being the usual payment for three years hard labor).This man new the pacific so well, many descriptions how life was in those savage exciting times.This book has only recently become available, i have read a few books about the blackbirders, but this is the one they all seem to use for reference."
1,"""Fabric"" Paper","I was expecting fabric, not paper...it was a disappointment - should have stated paper with fabric design."
3,Get what you pay for,"The book has some good pointers. Mostly the basics of sales, but for the price I would consider it a good bargain."
2,Just Ok,These buttons didn't work for a project we were working on - they were cheap looking and ended up giving them to an afterschool program for their arts & crafts.
5,hilarious,"this movie is hilarious. it also allows the main actor, kenichi matsuyama, to show off his acting talent as he juggles his two roles between that of a geek and the head of a heavy metal band."
4,BETTER LIVE?,"I bought this on LP many years ago, already a fan of David Torn from ""Planet X"" and ""Cloud About Mercury."" I was not prepared for this kind of music. At the time, I couldn't haven't even categorized it as anything other than ""noise."" It's apparent to me now that these are drum/guitar ""free-jazz"" improvisations/compositions. It's great to hear a top-notch, creative electric guitarist approaching that genre, as they are few and far between (dey's lots of saxophonists doe, dat fo' sure!). Adventerous stuff, reminiscent (though I suppose it should be the other way around) of Pat Metheny's ""Zero Tolerance for Silence."" I suppose that covers much of free jazz too."
3,a challenging read,"Interesting read, but fairly abstract and difficult to keep focused on. Would need to be a serious history student and/or very interested in this period in U.S. early times."
5,Ask a Frenchman,"De Tocqueville is required reading for anyone interested in the U.S. Constitution. Written about 50 years after the adoption of the Constitution, De Tocqueville gives an ""outsider"" view of our cConstitution and why it works better than any political system devised by the mind of man. More frightening, it demonstrates how far our government has strayed from the vision of the Framers. The ninteenth-century verbage can be difficult on occasion, but stick with it. It is worth the reading!"
3,A little dry and wordy.,"Haven't finished yet, so will rewrite when iHaven't finished yet, so will rewrite when I do.W. Morgan."
1,Dull and Annoying,"If you would like a historical novel, don't choose this one. It lacks accuracy in some major areas. The story line is overused and the characters lack dimension. I lived in the Mission House with Jason, this book was only semi-exciting to me because I know the people. There is so much more that could have been said that just wasn't."
2,This book was boring.,This book bored me. What kind of parent would make their kid do things constantly when they did not like the activites? This was the only book I did not like out of all the books I've read and I've read a lot.
4,this baby sitting charge could do it all,"claudia has to baby sit for a girl who turns everything she touches into gold. She's intelligent in english, math, singing,acting and dancing, but her real love is art. That's where claudia comes in. On a side note, claudia has her first ever art gallery show displaying drawings of junk food and other goodies."
5,video girl- grade A,"I love this dvd! The story and video is exactly like the books. Plus they give you great intermediate ""plays"". the only thing wrong with this dvd is that it only covers half of the story, and the ending is a little confussing about AI.(If you watch the end credits and see them all together)"
4,I want her to console me!,"I loved it. It summarized the plot in the 13 volume manga series very well, though it just skimmed over most of the major plots in the manga series."
5,Excellent,"If you enjoy bittersweet romantic comedies then this title is a definate purchase. the art works is crisp and bright, the dub track is pretty good, and the added extras are fun to watch. perhaps the only drawback is that this is only a subset of the entire manga story. by the end of the movie you'll be asking for more."
4,Good follow-up to first video!,"After Ai, a video girl, came out of his Tv from a rented video casette, she made it clear to the renter, one Yotra Moteuchi, that she'd help him get a date or noticed by Moemi, a cute classmate of his, who is in love with Yota's friend Takashi. In this episode, Ai has been given a dress by Yota as a thank you present, and she decides that the two should go on a date. It proves some fun, but the VCR Ai's tape is in is overheating, and she's fazing in and out of consciousness. However, she doesn't want to spoil the date, and it is rather cute. The next episode focuses closely on Yota and Moemi, and Ai finds out something about herself that is not supposed to happen to Video Girls: she's falling in Love with Yota!"
5,this should be on Showtime late night,The english dubb makes the characters have different personalities but I still love this show I has nudity and mature themes. Youta is a guy who has a crush on Moemi but too shy to tell her plus she is already dating his best friend Takashi who knows that Youta has a crush.
5,ATV Offroad Fury 2,ATV Offroad Fury 2 is awesome! This game is very challenging and fun. The graphics are amazing.
4,ATVer,"This is a great game, dont get me wrong, but ATV:Quad Power Racing 2 is a much better game, but Offroad Fury 2 has just asmuch fun.(ATV:QUAD POWER RACING 2 is not out yet, but you can play a demo of it if you buy an Official US Playstation magazinefor Feb.2003."
4,Fun and full of long lasting entertainment,"My dad bought this game. I had my dowts about a racing game, but it is a sure fire improvment over #1. The player actually moves when you turn and it has touchy steering. Get this game."
2,not very good,"This game was very repetive, i comepleted i in 2h, i would not recomened this game to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,An Average Game.,"If you like the first one for the Playstation 2 then you will most likely like this one. AS you know if you own the Network Adapter you can go online. Improvements over the first game include a better physics engine, better graphics, a first person view, rider customization, and of course the online gameplay. However I do have some major complants. The online aspect of the game feels somewhat rushed, beacuase it doesn't include a lobby. Also when playing againist computer opponents, they can knock you off your bike, but you cannot even toch them. Overall this is an average game and if you liked the previous title, then go ahead and pcik this one up."
4,good and bad,pros: -this game is a lot of fun to play and can keep you occupied for a very long time-lots of tricks you can do and a ton of things to unlock and complete-has very good multiplayer and single player modescons: -u have to work for a very long time to get better atv's and the atv's just have more acceleration and less speed-a lot of the tracks are very long and it can become annoying circling the track 5 timesthe reason i give this game a 4 is because of the multiplayer. me and my friend play tag a lot together and it can be a lot of fun. i do suggest that u get a network adapter so u can play with other people other than ur close friend. if u do buy the adaptor make sure u buy a cable line or phone line to reach the ps2. i made the mistake and forgot to buy it... now i cant go online until i do get it. i hope this review helped u in ur decision to buying this game and if u get it mayb ill play u online sometime.
2,I hate being a critic but...,"As the title says, I do hate being a critic because I couldn't even make a game in QBasic but... This game is annoying, it will tick you off. First of all there is no ""Fury"" or edge to this game. The soundtrack is awful and doesn't go with the game at all. There are flaws to this game with are rediculous! First of all, if you hit a rotting wood crate going 52MHP it will not cause you to go flying 400 yards, it will break. Second of all, you get a pixel off the track and this annoying screen comes up and tells you to get back on the track in 5 seconds. It will distract you, it will tick you off. This game could be great, but it needs work and I hope version 3 corrects these problem. Please, spend you money somewhere else or at least buy this used!"
5,Very Satisfied,GR8Barginz4all Shipped the correct product and did it in a timely manor and it was in excellent condition I would recomend them to my friends. The game is really good for off road people who like racing games.
4,ATV Offroad Fury Rules!,I Have a lot of games but this one is by far the best of them all. If you see this game in a store then you should buy it is a awesome game.
5,Great Game,"Atv offroad fury 2 is one of the best games i have played. it is twice as good as the first one. You can do the freestyle and get some big big air, or you can do the racing which is also a lot of fun. I would give this two thumbs up! you might want to rent this before you buy it because if you do not like atvs you will have wasted 40 bucks when you just could have rented it. All in all great game!"
2,ATV 1.5???,Ok I was a fan of the first game it was a good game not a great game so to see ATV 2 with very little change is disappointing the game still gets really boring after a half hourfor some reason.And by far the biggest disappointment is the Online Play feature which can't hold a candle next a game like Tony Hawk 4s online play this is just boring and really doesnt even feel like you are playing online for all you know it feels like this option was an after thought just to sell the game some more.All I can say if you already own the first game its hard to recommend this one even for the online play with all the other games out you can do better.
5,Confused...,"I got the disc and product key, but no memory card or cable. I'm not sure if you were suppose to get the card and cable with this product but I was pretty sure you did. I guess I can just try buying the other components seperately though."
1,Misrepresentation of product,"Don't buy this if you are hard-of-hearing, which is the only reason it was purchased.It is advertised as loud long ring for the hard of hearing and it is tremendously low. I am NOT hard of hearing and it was too low for me, so for my mother it is useless."
2,Disappointingly simple and sophomoric.,"""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is the perfect Japanese anime equivalent of an American sitcom -- while it's funny at times, most of the time it's just boring and disinteresting.The premise itself is amusing, in a sophomoric kind of way. The parts of a spell have been scattered and are now on the bodies of elves across the planet.You can see where this is heading, right?Hunt for elf, find elf, strip elf. Yep, that's about the size of it. Sure, it seems as though there might be hope on the horizon, but the premise itself, along with simplistic animation and less-than-interesting stories give one little reason to dish out the cash for the second tape when the first one was so lackluster.Put simply, ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is for a specific kind of audience only. Everyone else need not apply."
4,Sentimental Touch,"This is a brushed silver 25th wedding anniversary frame with a raised design on the front. The emblems on the front ~ the ""25th"" at the top, the ""Our Wedding Day"", and ""Our Silver Anniversary"" are stuck on and not engraved into the frame. The ones on my frame are a little crooked, but not so much that I will send it back. It is an attractive frame and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone thinking about purchasing. Lawrence frames, in general seem to be of good quality, and this is no exception."
1,FOR PHILOSOPHY MAJORS ONLY,"Deliberately obtuse language used intentionally to disguise a lack of ideas and ankle deep philosophy. Or the ""black hole prose"" is Massumi's self conscious defense of a serious deficiency in his ability to write in the English language. Occasionally this book perverts science in completely infuriating ways. No one ever reviewing this book ever comments specifically on the ideas contained in the book because they either can't figure out what the hell Massumi is saying, or they have pieced together what Massumi is rambling on about and think it must be deeper and more intelligent than they think. To reiterate, this book is either an elaborate joke, a philosophical version of Borat, or completely pretentious and an utter waste of time for any serious person. Book works great as a door stop and reading comprehension test. If you need neither, skip it."
5,Why don't more authors write stories like this?,"I'm totally in love with Heyer's books and aim to own every one of them at some point in my life. As usual this story delivers what everyone loves about her books; a romantic leading man who is somewhat of a rogue, in this case a gentelmanman turned robber. The period is vividly depicted and even the language of the characters is believable in that it fits in with the time period in which they live, a feat that many modern books set in the past fail to accomplish. This is definitely the type of book you could read over and over again!"
2,Sappy and Overwhelming,"I have a confession to make, I actually stopped reading this book after about 100 pages. Why? Because I decided that it wasn't worth my time. To be honest, I think I would have enjoyed this book when I was about 16, but now it just irked my soul with sappiness.Quite ridiculous. Like some hybrid of Elsie Dinsmore and the Scarlet Pimpernel.See the below quotations for proof:""I can imagine that you try Richard's patience somewhat...happily, your impetuosity in no way disturbs me."" p. 38.My favorite quote: ""She noted the firm, beautifully curved mouth, the aristocratic nose and delicately pencilled eyebrows, with a little thrill. The duel had set her every nerve tingling; she was filled with admiration for her preserver, and the sight of his sensitive, handsome countenance did nothing to dispel that admiration."" p. 74.How could anyone seriously read that last quote and not laugh out loud?"
2,A Highwayman & Lady,"Let me be honest. I'm sad to say that I struggled with this book for about 2 weeks now and decided today that it was time to move on and go to my next book on the list. Perhaps I'll go back to it at a later date, I'm not sure and perhaps someone else will enjoy it. The Black Moth was Heyer's first novel and I believe she was 15 years old when she wrote it. I'm not saying it was bad but I just couldn't get into it and I read 1/2 the book. I kept saying to myself...""Come on, come on...get with it."" Perhaps it may get better but I'm impatient at this point. I did enjoy her other books These Old Shades and Arabella.For now I have to give it 1-2 stars since I could only get through 11 chapters."
3,Added stories are stupid,No one can beat Georgette Heyer for a good laugh and a satisfying romance. I just wished the other crap and the cover weren't included.
4,Love Heyer!,"This was Heyer's first novel which she wrote when she was just 17. Many people say that it isn't as good as her later works, which I believe is true. But what she lacked in experience she certainly had in talent. I loved this book and have read it many times."
2,Romance is a sideline,"The real story is about one character and the relationship among men of the era, the romance plot is just a sideline."
2,Illustrated???,"The Black Moth by Georgette Heyer is a wonderful story. It was her debut novel. I have read it many times and enjoyed it. HOWEVER, I would not recommend paying the cost of this ""Illustrated"" edition in order to read it or own a copy. There are only about four illustrations in it, and all show typical Georgian clothing, two men's outfits and two women's. If you were hoping to get pictures or sketches actually illustrating the novel, you will be disappointed. Overpriced!"
5,Great for the coffee table!,"A tremendous collection of never-before seen candid photographs of Hollywood's golden age. Swope's B&W images are so crisp, they look like they were taken yesterday. Amazing stuff! Can't wait for volume 2!"
1,A Very Poor Quality Reproduction,"This was very disappointing. I was hoping for a fine volume for this reprinting of Swope's well-done l939 book. Instead, it seems very poor quality and not worth the purchase price. The photos could have been given such a richer and higher quality look. Too bad the publisher didn't invest enough to get a decent quality look. John Swope was a fairly decent photographer and when he had his interesting Hollywood friends pose for his camera, the result was usually worthy of a second look. Not great art - but worthy of some interest."
4,okay..... but missing something's,"My street seems like a good idea for a game, create a charecter, run around doing cool things like RC racing, playing marbles and preety much every thing you can do as a kid, even take it online. how ever- voice overs, though sometimes funny, got reaaaally annoying at times. you would be playing something like ""dodge ball"" or ""marbles"" and you would hear something like ""haha! i got the skills to pay the Bills"" which is stupid.and you should be able to explore the world more, and not haveing your mom yelling at you from across town (somehow) when you get passed the school yard. overall though, i liked the concept and the gameplay was fun but i still wished those problems werent there."
1,Worst game ive ever played,"This game is so bad, it accuatly gave me diahhirah. Right when i popped this game in the crappy music ruined it for me. It was fun for the first 2 minutes. There are some funny mini games, but thats all it is. Mini games. IT SUCKS. If your lookin for some puzzlin fun and you are under the age of 3, by all means, pick this title up. But if you like video games, Avoid this game.Pros- I never have to play this game againCons- This game exists"
1,Horrible.,"If I had a choice it wouldn't even recieve one star. This game was horrible in almost all aspects of gameplay. The whole game was based souly on mini-games, which are dull and lifeless. This game is an utter dissapointment, I reccomend no one to buy this game. Now stop reading this and go find a good game to play."
1,"Look CLOSELY at content: sadly, I found it mostly worthless!","I loved his Solaris PG; it was one of the very best Solaris books.However, I was shocked and very disappointed to see the contents of this book is mostly shell, Xwindows (etc), and other mundane commands.Compare this to other Linux books that cover broader and deeper Linux topics. I unfortunately feel many other books offer a much more practical, useful value.So, look closely and think carefully before buying this book.(Based on the 1st glowing review, Maybe my impression doesn't apply to everyone. And I'm sorry to feel so totally negative about this book because Sobell's other books are so great.)"
4,Good program,Tried it but switched to Ubuntu. Just got the book to better understand the system. Found Ubuntu to be more to my liking.
2,It does not look like a practical guide,"I read half of the book, but I realized that it is NOT really a practical guide as he titled, rather boring textbook. He spent a lot of space as describing the topics with many tables, and it made me boring to read this book continuously. What is a practical guide? It might be different from a reader to a reader, but what I am thinking is that he should have provided more practical examples instead of providing tables of describing menus or options. We can know them by reading manuals or man command.If you are a beginner and are looking for a practical book, then you need to be careful to choose this book."
4,Excellent technical and directional guide.,This book is a must have for anyone interested in seeking the sly trout in North Georgia. He is very complete in his technique and equipment sections and his maps are very thorough and easy to read. I never go fishing without it.
4,If you're a Subs fan you should buy this.,"I had ignored this compilation for years because I assumed it was just another dodgy compilation. But guess again...this CD features a whole bunch of obscure demo's that you won't find anywhere else. Some of these have been previously released - most notably on the Demonstration Tapes record which came out in the mid 80's (which itself was a reissue of sorts).Even more annoying, the sleeve notes make no mention of the fact that these are alternate takes/ demos etc.. So if you're a Subs fan you should find this release interesting and enjoyable. I certainly recommend it."
1,Not Very Accurate,"It looks nice but does not provide accurate measurements. I bought one, exchanged it for two or three new ones. All were defective. But they all look nice."
4,good games for kids,"My 5-year old son loves all of the pajama sam games. I was worried this game wouldn't work under vista, but no problems. Not as good as the original pajama sam, but still good family fun."
5,Great easy fit,"I really like this helmet, it is easy to adjust and fit to my 4 year old's head and she seems much more comfortable in it than her old helmet. Much easier to take on and off than others we've tried."
5,Simply satisfying,"I love this book for its straightforward, uncomplicated and tasty recipes. And, wanted to give a new copy to a young couple we know. Am surprised to find this wonderful cookbood is out of print. Someone should tell the publisher to print a new edition."
5,A MUST HAVE COLLECTABLE BOOK,You will be as smitten as I was with this captivating cat peering at you through the curtain. A stunning tribute and a deserving one. Every cat should be this loved.
5,"A wonderful, heartwarming story.","If you have ever loved or been loved by a special pet, then this book will touch your soul. The tale of Buffy is told so superbly that you can actually feel the love between the writer and this most amazing feline. The photographs are beautiful, and add warmth and life to the story. If this wonderful book does not bring a smile to your lips and maybe a tear or two to your eyes, then you need to check your pulse, there's a possibility that your heart has been replaced by a rock."
4,Not really what it seems,"For those not ""in the know"" After a recorded concert not fit for release, Phil, et.al. rented a hall, and without a live audience, recorded this ""Live"" album. Nonetheless, the recording is clean, with good renditions and Phil is in control of his emotions and his drinking. Worth its price, it's a good listen. Just remember,that what you hear is not was you're being told you're hearing."
3,Warning - really leaves you hanging!,"I really like this series, but this one should have been combined with the next book in the series since it is just a build-up for the next prophecy that Gregor has to face."
4,excellent book,This book is great. It brings you all over the Underland looking for the mice and how Gregor and his friends have to go through some losses. The only bad part is the author does not tell the Prophecy of Time. I am wondering what it is. I recommend this fantastic book to readers who enjoy adventure stories.
3,It's okay....,"Well, Gregor and the Marks of Secret is alright, but in my opinion, it's definetly the worst in the series. Coming from a writer's opinion, this book wasn't really even needed in the series. My mom and I both agreed upon the fact that Luxa starting the war is really the only important thing that happens.It took me awhile to get this book from my school library, and I felt that it wasn't worth the wait. There is literally NO plot, and the romance between Gregor and Luxa just isn't working for me. I still suggest reading this book because most likely you have to read it for next book in the series to make sense, but I don't suggest blowing your money to actually BUY the book.Oh, last but not least- the cover is horrible. Luxa-ew. The one color thing- this isn't Harry Potter."
4,Excellent continuation of the series.,"My wife, sons and I have all enjoyed the Gregor series. The violence isn't too violent, the language is well crafted but not over the head of a ten year old. Suzanne Collins provides action adventure with some underlying cultural currents.This book is a great addition to the line."
5,Really love this series,Great reading if you like an easy read then this is a good series to pick up. I have enjoyed every book
4,Gregor and the Marks of Secret,"I completely and totally recommend this book. I read it in about one day and started crying when I was done, because it was so good. I will definitely be ready for the 5th book, waiting with so many questions about what happens next. I suggest, if you are thinking about reading the 4th book, that you wait for the 5th book to come out so you can go right into it. Unlike me who now has to wait untill May to continue the series. Please read and enjoy the book."
3,"A warning to parents---extremely gruesome, may not be age-appropriate for your child!","Collins continues her descent into age-inappropriate material with a Holocaust story, complete with gas chambers and a Hitler-figure. Two and a half stars."
3,Good stories for early teens but violent.,"The stories are engaging but violent. As the series continues, it gets more violent as Gregor discovers his is a 'rager.'"
3,Meh,I just feel like someone dies in every book! Which they do... But they ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE FOREVER IN DANGER
5,The Underland Chronicles Gregor and the Marks Of Secret,"The Underland Chronicles are a must read for adventure fans. Suzanne Collins takes us on a marvelous journey alongside Gregor. There is suspense,love, and plenty of action. I couldnt put the books down"
5,great reading,I thought that this book was exciting and suspenseful for the reader. The way she writes makes you want to keep reading and each chapter ends with a cliff hanger to keep you wanting more.
3,Not as great.,"I have read all of the books in the series. This is sort of like an in-between book, a filler. It has no prophecey, and they're isn't too much action compared to the other books. I liked all of the other books, especially the Code of Claw, but this was by FAR the worst of them."
5,Love this series,"Such a big adventure for the kids, my girls 7 and 11 both love this series. We're enjoying reading it aloud at bed time. Oddley with all the rats, roaches, bats, mice and snakes we've not had one whisper of a bad dream. The kids in this book are heroes. We love that there is just enough humor to take the edge of what could be scary, frighting or disgusting. You won't regret getting these books."
3,Lacking in plot,"I agree with another reviewer that this book is really just Part 1 of Book 5. The book doesn't really have a climax-- it's basically just one long journey to discover what has become of the nibblers. The discovery is made, and the travelers return to Regalia.Even when the awful discovery is made, I didn't feel really attached to the nibblers until afterwards, when Luxa reveals that she knew many of those who were killed. Being privy to her personal connections with individual nibblers earlier in the story could have added a lot more power to the death scene.There's just not enough going on here to hold a reader's attention. Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods sets a precedent that is hard to match."
5,Five star novel!,"Suzanne Collins does a fabulous job of recapturing the underland in her fourth installment of the series. This book is an amazing novel for those that love adventure stories, and it keeps you reading because it's so exciting!"
4,Not just happy adventure time,"3 adjectives that describe this book: unexpected, gripping, tragicI love the Gregor books! Sometimes series books about quests can be repetitive and predictable. However, Suzanne Collins does a great job, in this series, of creating unexpected plot paths for each book. The characters are well-developed, complicated, and messy. Their morals become even more fuzzy and challenged in this installment of the series. Gregor finds violence sickening, but was born with a rare and natural talent for fierce, deadly fighting. Luxa, burdened by responsibility and heartache, emerges as a harsh ruler who is prepared to avenge her allies through slaughter.Gregor and the Marks of Secret is the first book in the series that doesn't end with sunshine and roses. It is also the only book in the series that clearly sets up the next book. I can't wait to crack open the final installment and see how conflict in the Underland emerges from it's fever-pitch."
5,WHOOHOO,"AWESOME, just plain awesome everything is so perfect in this book, just plain awesome almost as good as the hunger games"
4,pleasantly surprised,"I bought this camera for my 6 yr old daughter because she kept wanting to borrow my camera and I certainly didn't trust her not to drop it. I like the fact that this camera comes on a lanyard so she can wear it around her neck. Considering this is only a $25 camera the pictures are better than I thought they would be as long as she's actually standing still, a little grainy but not bad. She's taken pictures inside and out, both came out fine. Battery life seems very good. Overall very happy with the purchase so far."
