3,Beautiful cover but...,"Some of Virginia Henley's books are wonderful, others are horrid. This one falls somewhere in between. I never felt connected with the main characters - Jane and Lynx. Maybe because they never really connected with each other. They seemed like cardboard figures - they said lots of things, they did lots of things but their souls never seemed to touch one another. Henley is usually great for hot, steamy sex but I found most of it very wooden or crude in this book. And what was she thinking when she made historical figures say ""Dream on!"" or ""She's one helluva woman!"" This book was a fast read but not very memorable. (An odd aside, though - the paperback's inside cover was one of the most beautiful I've ever seen!)"
2,predictable,"sorry, ms. henley but i did'nt really enjoyed this story very much. the story mostly revolves on getting an heir and nothing much, especially romance. you can almost predict the story right from the begining. the only interesting part are around the bruce's era which is quite good to read. hope in future you can write more interesting story. addios......"
2,"It's ok, but I wouldn't recommend it","I found myself wishing the story would move along a little faster. The conversations among warlords and details of war movements were dull. . I didn't like that Lynx was so selfish sexually during his first two nights with her. Lynx didn't trust women. He thought they were deceitful. Jane became that way too. I didn't like that she was purposely playing hard to get with Lynx. It worked to create more lust, but that is not the kind of story I like to read. Lynx's former mistress and sister were also game playing and/or deceitful. On the positive side, two scenes come to mind that surprised me, one was with the lynx animal at the beginning. The other was the nourishment she gave to Lynx during his healing. Other than those, nothing else surprised or delighted me. I didn't laugh at anything. I was annoyed at a few things. I didn't respect, like or admire the main characters enough."
5,SUPERB! EXCITING! ROMANCE AT ITS BEST!,"I see that some reviewers were complaining about the language in this book. Who knows how they talked back then and who cares. All I know is I understood the characters and it didn't take away from the time period. I love Lynx and Jane but the story of Robert Bruce and Marjory was so exciting! The way she described Robert Bruce, he must have been breathtaking. I just want to say if you are looking for history well pick up a history book. But if you are looking for romance this book will fulfill this need. Virginia you are wonderful, I anxiously await your next book."
5,Another Wonderful Henley Book,"I have to agree with the other reviewers, this is one of the best of Ms Henley's books. Lynx wants nothing more from Life than to have an heir, although you get the impression that any child would do. Jane comes from a large family and is a healer. Her father is concerned for her and so agrees to Lynx's propsal to hand fast Jand to him. As their love grows so does the conflict around them. A must read book."
1,awful... was disgusted within the first 5 pages!!,I am sorry but I dont think that romance starts with sex in the first few pages. That is soft porn not romance. Also Henley has a thing for animals that I find sickening.
3,Nice but where is Bono?,"There is a nice variety of music hear to raise awareness about the genocide in East Timor in the 90s, but don't buy it expecting to hear Bono or Billy Bragg. Maybe they are doing some one-handed clapping on it."
2,"""Deceptive Title, ""The Greatest from the London Symphony""","I only opened one of the three CDs but there was something missing on the disc! No mention of 'The London Symphony' Then, I looked on the BACK of the beautifully packaged set and found these words, ""The London Symphony and others"" Now, I'm wondering, Who are the ""others"" and if it is a recording that's not LSO. It was offered by Amazon,and I've never been disappointed by Amazon's 'offerings.' Check it out, Amazon staff!!"
4,VINTAGE GUITAR Magazine says:,"Italian jazzman Roberto Colombo's Stringology (String Jazz records) is charged with a hard-swinging groove. His hot guitar lines duel with clarinetist Alfredo Ferrario, evoking the glorious mood of the Charlie Christian-Benny Goodman and Django Reinhardt-Hubert Rostaing duets."
2,Bought it for a class,I got this book to compliment a text book for class. Easiest class I ever took. Didnt even need to open this book up.
2,Episode is Less Than a Treasure,"The Tunnel Dwellers find a priceless buried treasure and begin to bicker over what to do with the contents. One Tunnel Dweller becomes consumed with greed and resorts to violence to get what he wants. You've seen this type of thing before, and this episode breathes no new life into the story. It never really rises above the level of cliche.In 1998 I conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale. 31 fans participated. ""Fever"" finished 41st out of the 44 episodes.I placed ""Fever"" 43rd in my own personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering of the 44 episodes."
3,not bad but spanish gold in New York?,"the show wasn't bad, but they made a serious mistake spanish gold in new york? I thought that was in florida?are they trying to tell us something?I have a group on this show if your interested mail me!"
3,Re-heats crisply,3 1/2Caspian here are the rare second-tier post-rock band capable of utilizing elements found in flagship groups while still managing to maintain at least a fraction of freshness.
3,Difficult but...,"This book is seasoned economists only... It IS badly written, the theory is unnecessarily complicated, but then again it was certainly not intended to be an elegant political essay. If you want to know about the scientific depths of economic integration between nations, this is the right reading for you. But be prepared to take a lot of aspirin."
1,"Boring, uninteresting book","This is a total contrast to american books. It is without colors, pictures. You can hardly find a graph in it. Besides this, that the book is not interesting to look at and it is also written in a totaly ununderstandable way. It wants to be sophisticated, but it is a crap! I would not recomend this book to anyone who does not really need it."
5,Beautiful thread work!!!!,Nancy Prince is so talented!!! Her book is so inspiring..I want to take a chance and make quilts like her...Her thread work is amazing!!!
1,Don't buy this game!,I bought this game for my son hoping for a real simulation experience for him. It was a waste of money. The game is slow and has little ablitiy to allow for any real control of plane. After one time he has not played it again.
1,Doesn't fly,"Technical problems, lack of documentation, and tech support no longer available as original co. was sold"
3,Warning for owners of AM/PM Stretch DVD,"This DVD is the bonus workout from AM/PM Stretch. If you don't own AM/PM Stretch, I'd recommend that one instead since it has a total of three different workouts while this DVD is only one 20 minute workout."
2,Ok workout but no personality,This woman is -- at least from the evidence of her DVD -- devoid of personality or a sense of humor. She rushes through the workouts in a monotone as if she will be glad when they are over. I was too.
1,The Flamingo,"I really just wanted to stretch and do some extensions. If I would have known that I'd be standing on one foot and trying to balance while stretching, I wouldn't have brought this DVD."
1,daily stretch,A real waste of money. The video has no sound & no instruction. All you get to watch is a woman rushing through a very poor routine.
2,Michael Madsen? I don't think so.,"Madsen shows up at the very beginning of the movie in one scene for less than two minutes and at the very end of the movie in another scene for less than one minute. Obviously the filmmaker(s) knew him and asked him to do them a favor, which he generously did. The rest of the film is weak--mediocre acting and writing. Not a good use of your time at all. Don't even rent it; it's not worth it."
5,REGGAE AMBASSADORS AT THEIR BEST,"Blown away at these new versions of all their classic hit. The sound is like a private concert in your home. Bunny Ruggs and company truly at their best. The new tunes especially 'Jamacia' it's like an autobiography of the band, after one listen you will be singing along 'No Problem Man'. One of the best i've heard from this super band since 'Now That We Found Love'........."
1,Where is the track listing???,It would have been helpful if amazon had given us the track listing for this CD!
3,"Cute, but won't become a classic","My 3.5 year old picked this out at a book fair, and really enjoys it. It has an attached nightlight: a bear figurine whose face lights up when you press a button on the back of the book (it turns itself off after 15 minutes or so, so the batteries won't conk out the first night). I think any preschooler would enjoy the book, especially one who isn't too thrilled with the idea of bedtime.The rhymes are cute enough, but not particularly memorable. Ditto the illustrations. The story is pretty standard: child (bear) is reluctant to go to bed, so mommy provides something special to ease the transition. So, this isn't an instant classic but it's certain to please your toddler."
5,B&B Seaweed Conditioner,"Lovely smell and leaves your hair feeling soft without heaviness...very nice! Great for my fine, limp hair..."
1,Knockoff Product!,"Getting Bumble and Bumble conditioner for less than $20 *is* too good to be true. Being a long time user of this product line, I knew immediately upon receiving this item it was a knockoff. The container label was already wiping away, the scent was off and the texture of the conditioner was gritty. Seriously?!"
3,Just OK,"For the price this is just OK, equal to a much less expensive brand. I remembered it to be better than it was,unfortunately."
3,This Conditioner is not for thick hair,I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for a few weeks now and I love the shampoo although I have not been as impressed with this conditioner. I have thick hair and it gets very frizzy. This conditioner does help but not as much as I hoped and it seems to takes alot more to get the coverage I need for my hair. It doesn't seem to actually make the hair soft either. Rinses away clean but my hair doesn't feel as soft as it did before I conditioned. This product is ok but I will try something else next time.
1,"Counterfeit Product – DO NOT BUY from this vendor (Deal Seekers, NY)","I have no idea what this is – but it’s not Bumble & Bumble Seaweed! I love B&B, but I have no idea what’s in this bottle. It arrived with plastic around the top – which was good since it had exploded. There is a horrible chemical smell coming from it. It does not feel or act like B&B in your hair. I used it twice to make sure. I am sure. This is NOT B&B. The code on the bottom of the bottle is “ H47A”. It’s going in the trash if I can’t return it. I went to Target and bought a real bottle for $22. I guess if the price is too good to be true….well, you know the rest."
5,An extraordinary book!,This book is about a boy who saves a dragon. They go on an adventure to get home. They meet interesting people along the way. I loved all the characters but my favorite was Boris the dragon. This book has a lot of adventures in it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes dragons.
5,A favorite read aloud book!,"These three adventurous tales by Ruth Gannett kept my 5 year old son spellbound night after night--he continually begged me to read ""just one more chapter!"" and we are almost finished with our second time reading it. The trilogy begins with the main character, Elmer Elevator, venturing away from home to save a baby dragon from being abused by the animals of Wild Island. What follows are a series of Elmer's and the baby dragon's exciting adventures. This is a great read aloud book for ages 5-9!"
5,Imaginations soar,"My son absolutely adored all three of these books and continues to ""wish"" for more stories. It is a fun and engaging story and will continue to entertain readers for many years to come."
5,Wonderful grade-school book,"Recently bought this for my grandson. It's great this this is still in print after all these years. I wish the illustrations were in color, and I wished this sixty years ago when I was in grade school myself; but they're not."
4,Great for kids and adults to share!,"My niece (age 10) read this book to me as I drove over 1200 miles on our road trip this past summer. The language is a bit dated, but that's a good thing, because it gave opportunities for discussion. She really enjoyed reading it aloud to me, and it is a very fun and cute story to hear. Like many children's books, it is filled with animal and fantasy characters who live interesting lives and we get to hear parts of the story from different perspectives: both 'my father' and his dragon play main parts.I recommend this book as a chapter book for children to read or as a nighttime book for parents to read aloud to younger children."
4,Love My Father's Dragon!,"I grew up hearing my mother read her old copy of ""My Father's Dragon"" and it was always a favorite. My son (almost 3 yrs old) is old enough that he is really loving hearing chapter books before bed now, and I was so pleased that he enjoyed listening to ""My Father's Dragon"" almost as much as I enjoyed reading it to him. When I was on amazon I happened to find that this book is available with ""My Father's Dragon"" and two sequels I was very excited! We have now read all three, and although we don't think the sequels are as good as the first book, it was still a great buy, and well worth the price. :)"
4,A great read aloud book for 4 and 5 year olds,"The ""My Father's Dragon"" series by Ruth Stiles Gannett is a great adventure book for younger children. My 5 year old son loved the book and his father enjoyed the short chapters for before bedtime reading."
5,Delightful Surprise,"I was browsing the list of audiocassettes and happened across ""Three Tales of My Father's Dragon."" I read the other reviews and decided to buy it for my son (who is 4). We absolutely fell in love with all three stories! We listen to it ALL the time! We leave one cassette in the house to listen to at night and one in the car. We have had the tapes for two months and have not tired of listening to them. My son just laughs and loves all the aspects of these stories. The acting of all the characters is so vibrant and you quickly realize that each character has his own distinct personality and voice! I would HIGHLY reccomend these stories! They are fantastic!"
4,A Boon for Boomers,"Cullinane and Fitzgerald discuss many aspects of retirement with clearly outlined topics, lively anecdotes, checklists, and worksheets. Their suggestions will appeal to boomers who may be anticipating retirement, except for their ""recommended living locations"" listings in chapter 5. Some of their upscale venue ideas are beyond the financial resources of many boomers. Some readers may find gaps in their discussion addressed helpfully in a recent publication--Spiritual Wisdom for Successful Retirement: Living Forward [Haworth Press]. For the price and timely facts, this is an excellent resource."
3,The book is so comprehensive it's superficial,"In the introduction, the authors note that this is the only book on retirement that addresses both lifestyle and financial issues. I looked forward to this resource that promised to treat me like a whole person. Unfortunately though, the book for me seemed less a guide on retirement and more like a college project gone wild. It was as if the author's carted armloads of books back from the library and scoured the Internet and then cut and pasted the material they liked to make this book. As a consequence of tossing at the reader all conceivable information about a topic, the retirement specific issues don't get enough attention. Much of the information here is better left to other books, such as the detailed tips on working with a contractor to build a new custom home. For me the book was a waste of my time in trying to cull the few retirement related morsels from the warmed over generic dribble."
5,Retirement,This is a great book for the person retiring! I gave this to my father in-law for Christmas after his retirement and he really enjoys it!
2,Not great,"This book is only part read.Not going to finish it, infact just skimmed it.Alot of it is on certain locations, and not what I wanted to read about. I wanted more info. on financial planning."
3,Not What I Expected.,"This book is too general to be useful to me--I could do as well to pick up a magazine. It spends half its pages on recommended locations in the USA for retirement, a topic which is covered many other places. It's not bad for a quick read at the beach but that's about it."
3,retiement ultimate guide,I expected a little more scientific approach. I found a MUCH better book and will only use this one as a cross-reference.
5,Surprising record,This one was surprising me because of a very good version of the Statesboro Blues. And all the others are good as well.
2,"Update will fashion ""Blasphemy"" exception to the shield of the 1st Amendment","Always prescient to the collective needs of his times, Czar Sunstein has fashioned a ""reasonable"" theoretical framework for allowing the government to regulate and control ""expression"" classified as ""unnecessary"" to Madison's concern for ""deliberative democracy"". (You can almost be excused for failing to notice that ""government"" will be deciding where and when such boundaries are erected.)His formulation can easily be refined to support the ""Dhimmitude"" of our country towards Islamic (or other) theological ravings. At a time when free expression can be easily, if not hysterically, likened to a loaded semi-automatic assault weapon, this exegesis is a welcome beacon to guide us away from the otherwise unpleasant clashes between the violent and the narrow minded."
1,It's scary how close this guy is to becoming a Supreme Court justice.,I'm simultaneously giving this book one star and telling you that you must read this book. Sunstein's ideas stand in direct opposition to what our constitution's framers intended. People need to be aware of this man's dangerous ideas and the direct threat they pose to liberty.
5,Rush out and buy it.,"I loved the story and highly recommend buying ""Mom's the Word."" It was wonderfully written with a fresh plot. The heroine's struggle to support her baby moved me to tears and the happy ending left me feeling satisfied as a reader. This book is keeper and has a special place on my bookshelf."
3,"a short , but nice show in a bar","a typical session, but a short video(28'), a nice moment with the NGDB live, in their last(5 people) group.the sound capture is not very good."
5,Oishi!,"Delicious sauce. Its really very good, one of the best Tonkatsu sauces you can get I hear, and I agree, its tastey!however, I bought this for under $4 with tax from the Japanese food store, so this is more then a little over priced. Great product, plenty of it in the bottle, but bad price."
3,Prior reviewer is dead worng,"These are absolutely the original artists (Looking Glass, Climax, Gallery, etc.) - I don't know what the prior reviewer is thinking. I own it just to fill in with some of those ""one hit wonders"" from when I was a kid."
5,Acoustic genius!,"Unwigged & Unplugged is an awesome showcase of talent from the men behind This Is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, and Waiting For Guffman, among others. Featuring acoustic versions of the songs that made these movies a pleasure. Well worth the purchase."
4,Funny and entertaining,"I attended the Nashville show on this tour. Very funny and very entertaining.They cover material from ""This is Spinal Tap"", Chris Guest's mockumentaries including ""A Mighty Wind"", and assorted other tidbits. McKean's wife Annette O'Toole performs two songs with the group, and Harry Shearer's wife Judith Owen performs a song from ""Waiting for Guffman"" along with Guest (in character as Corky St. Clair). The band takes a break during the set for some Q&A; from the audience, and you'll laugh at some of the answers.The guys are funny, the material is good, and the price is right. A no-brainer."
2,Flawed Album,"This has some great songs, but I would rather have the album Too Much Pressure, than this compilation. With so much Selecter available, why hasn't anyone released this classic ska recording?"
5,TPOH - excellent band that slipped under the public's radar.,All of TPOH's cds are good to great and Love Junk rates as their best. Too bad the general public completely missed this tremendous talent.
1,Like the music teacher you never wanted,"As a rank beginner who can't read music or play any other instrument, I bought this book hoping for a quick, friendly intro to the fiddle. But it doesn't really seem to be written for self-teaching; instead, it offers a series of ""exercises"" (i.e. not music!) for teachers to assign. What little text there is (the book is mostly music and a few pictures) is pedantic and unfriendly, and even in the illustrations the model never looks like he's enjoying the instrument. The material itself, while skimpy, is useful -- you learn how to play four notes on each string. I haven't found a better alternative, but this is not an encouraging place to begin."
3,"Pretty good, but one major drawback!",There's one major drawback: There's no CD available! otherwise an ok supplement.
5,Great book,easy to understand! and great for beginners..moved through the book with ease and very informative.......would buy from this author again
5,Great watch!,I really enjoy this watch. I think the dials are a little small to see but I have gotten used to it. I find myself just checking it out often. I keep it in it's case at night and I love to put it on in the morning. The service from the company was very good as well...
2,The Philosopher Emperor - So So Story,"""Gods and Legions"" is a well written book. Michael Curtis Ford is a capable writer who knows how to piece together a decent story. He had a good amount to work with in Emperor Julian, the last Roman Emperor to hold onto a polytheistic view on religion; and while the story moves along nicely, and the core characters have a reasonable amount of flesh, the aggregate just didn't pull me in.I really enjoyed Ford's ""The Fall of Rome"". What his stories lack in emotional depth, he makes up for in the plot pace, and a good variation of action and politics.I'd consider ""Gods and Legions"" a solidly average piece of Roman military fiction."
3,Book Review,"I enjoyed the book overall, but got ""bogged down"" in some of the battle descriptions. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable read."
5,Fantastic historical fiction!,"I truly enjoyed reading this book. On the surface, it's a great action/war book with several great battle scenes. These battle scenes were written wonderfully, and many of the descriptions would make excellent shots in a movie (my fingers remain crossed for this to happen).Beneath the surface this book is much more than just action. I especially enjoyed the development of the Julian character. The philosophical discussions between Julian and Caesarius and others was interesting and thought-provoking.I know I've read a good book when I feel sad when I've finished reading it. ""Gods and Legions"" is a good book.I'll definately be reading more books in this genre, as well as the other books my Michael Curtis Ford."
2,also disappointed,"Put me down as agreeing with other reviewers who found the latter half of this book tedius. Somehow, Ford allowed his narrator to become a monotonous, carping voice, stating and overstating Julian's descent into paganism. In the process, Julian becomes one-sided and uninteresting, yet he's the subject of this book! His first book was better."
3,Eh...,"I don't really know what this was supposed to do really but it doesn't do too much. I would suggest using it if you have curly hair to help define the curls, but it doesn't work that well. It could be a bit stronger, but it's better than nothing."
5,An awesome model for Education,"I have 4 children, all whom have been raised in private schools implementing these valuable teachings. When education is not so much about academics and competition, but character growth, spiritual growth, service, and cooperation, you see some pretty amazing kids as a result. Academics are not underplayed (the average score of the high school students was 95% of national averages on National Aptitude Tests), it's just that academics are not paramount around which all else revolves. I see the results largely as the product of the children's education: caring, loving, generous, kind, self-aware, and yes very smart, individuals as a result of Education for Life. Certainly it is the most profound model of positive education in our age. I'd recommend livingwisdom.org and livingwisdomschool.org for more information. Certainly read this book and if you are not near a school that utilizes the principles you can still bring them into your own family with great success."
2,Q Chord cheap made case.,We were disappointed with the quality of this Q Chord case. It has no padding. It has no good hinges and no good fastener. The hinges are the plastic case itself and the fastener is just a plastic clip. Both will evenually break off with use. It would be more of a $10 item than a $50 item that they charge. I was expecting a quality case like the Omni Chord used to have.. It seems things are being made cheap these days. What has happened to quality?
2,Wasn't helpful at all,"I had surgery last year to clean up arthritis in both knees. However I still have pain and stiffness which limits what I can do. The surgeon recommended this supplement. I was hoping to give it a trial for several months, but it affected my stomach and I finally gave up on it after 6 weeks. My knees felt considerably worse while I was taking it. For me, I think knee replacements are the answer."
2,Low dose,The components are excellent but it is a very low dose. At Costco I found a higher dose for a little more money.
4,Ok product,"I have been taking them for joint pain, not sure if they are actually doing anything but I am trying different things at this point."
5,And that's how it was and is...,"I read this book back in the late 60's, while in Junior High. While being surrounded by a family of veterans and all my neighbors were veterans, they never really discussed what it was to be in the Service, much less deployed in a combat zone. I always thought the story was a bit dark and surreal, but after serving for 25 years in the Navy as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician, have been there and seen that Mr. Atwell's story is more relevant today. This is evident by the number of World War II veterans who are finally writing about their experiences. A whole new generations of veterans have been born with their own stories...which like Mr. Atwell's ""Private"" are a lessons learned blueprint for what being in the Service and serving in a hostile environment is about. Many of these stories need to be told and retold as time passes and this generation disappears. This is simply a great story, illustrative of the thousands of young Americans who served."
3,Not really what I expected,"To start, I have always been more than happy with every Philosophy product I have ever received. I love this brand, and I feel that they make wonderful products, but this Big Mouth primer falls short.I got it in thinking this would be a great answer from my many Makeup-God prayers. Well, it was...for a little while at least.It arrived prompty in a nice looking, skinny tube. I applied it onto my lips, and felt a nice silky feeling. I applied lipstick over and went about my day. My lipstick had come off completely in a matter of a few hours, but the primer remained on. My lips did not appear ""plump"" and this product just did not deliver what it promised.Now, I like the feeling of the silkiness it brought to my lips, so I do, however use this as a clear ""chapstick"" kind of product. I had to get SOME use of my $20!"
3,"Okay, but a little pricey.","Doesn't moisturize quite like I'd like, does ""plump"" for a while. Wei East's China Herbal Lip Therapy is still my top pick, but doesn't come in a tube form like a lipstick."
5,a master at the decks,"i've had the priveledge of seeing kazell a couple of times and i have to say his skillz behind the decks are beyond human comprehension at times... he spun a marathon 5 hour set at the crescent room in ATL for his cd release party and it can be safe to say that he tore the roof off that place. not feeling constrained by a typical genre like so many other djs his genre crossover mixing techniques deserve commendation where so many other djs fail.while many progressive trance dj's seem to flirt with monotany and boredom it seems to me like kazell's style has evolved lightyears beyond its own time. tribal house, progressive breaks, trance... this guy flips beween these different styleswith the greatest of ease and his mixing is never incongruent no matter where he is taking you. this cd is a fine example of what the right records in the right hands can do. highly recommended."
2,Does not fit Ducati steering stem,"This item will not fit a Ducati steering stem. To be specific my bike is a Ducati 999R, this item is too small."
1,Mostly pictures,I bought this book thinking it was going to be a biography on Stevie. When I got it I found it to be a thin book with about 90% pictures. The man talked a bit about how he tried to get her to authorize it in the beginning. Then it was all black and white picutes. A few are kinda nice but most are just from a concert taken and they aren't real nice depictions of her. Toward the end he blabbers on about some other artists. Some Tori Amos lady and some other people. I can learn more about Stevie from reading articles free off the internet. I think it was a waste of money (...) on some black and white pictues that I could find better ones free off the internet. Don't waste your money on this book. It teaches you nothing about Stevie. I wish someone would just write a book about her. Like mabye Stevie should do one. She's supposed to but it says it was never published. The moral: don't bother. (...) I could have gotton that Street Angel cd I need!
1,A very poor book,"This book is a great disappointment.The only information within this book are various newspaper and magazine articles that the author mentions. Anyone, I think, could have written this book. All he did was quote several PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN articles and give his own opinions. Over half the book consists of photos of Stevie (most of which are NOT very good at all). There is even full section of the book about OTHER artists that he seems to think are similar to Stevie. Very far off, IMO.Also, the book is written very poorly. Simply read the excpert Amazon provides and see what I mean. In reading this, you will also notice that the author flat out tells you that Stevie, her management, even her parents, all stated (on numerous occasions) that they wanted nothing to do with the making of this book.Kinda pathetic, I think."
2,Comical piece of work,"No wonder Stevie Nicks wouldn't help with this work! It has very little value: There's the tiniest of chances that one of his multitude of pictures contains a caption; and, if that's not 14pt type on the entire five pages of text in this book ... I'm the pope. A ridiculous waste of $12.00. Recommendation: Run, don't walk away from this turkey."
3,"A cute, fluffy Stevie Nicks book","This is simply a ""fluffy"" Stevie Nicks picture book, full of cute pictures of her I'd never seen before. That's really all the value this book has. If you know that and don't expect anything else, grab it! I've already got a bunch of Fleetwood Mac books. I figure a cute little book full of Stevie Pictures isn't going to hurt. The art by Johanna Pieterman (she does wonderful drawings) is another reason I got this book. I love Johanna's work."
2,Wonderful photos; not so wonderful text,"The best thing about this book is the photos; and that's about it. The text is boring and uniformative, and the type is huge and there's almost as many advertisements in it as there is text about Stevie. Definately a good buy to have the photos, but that is it."
3,uhh....,theres hardly any text to this book. all it is is black and white pictures. not worth the $$$
2,"STEVIE NICKS 1999, REVIEW BY THORNE CARRINGTON S.C.","The book was poor but had a lot of good photo of stevie nicks, I have walked with stevie on her long road of life for meany year now, 20 and counting. If you are looking to find yourself for who you are look to stevie nicks. PELA STEVIE ALWAYS BE TRUE TO YOURSELF."
4,There is a better way,"This is a good history book on how things were before, DV video is the more modern way to go, it is cheaper (Less then $3.00 per hour to film versus over $450 per hour with 16 mm film) DV video lasts 60 minutes before you have to change it out of the camera and 16mm lasts only 11 minutes before you have to change it. A 16mm camera costs over $25,000 while a decent Prosumer DV Camera costs $3,500. You can edit DV Video on your high powered PC much easier then on film, plus you need special equipment to edit 16mm film. If you would like to get a history lesson on how film is made this is the book for you, otherwise buy the book ""Digital Filmmaking 101"" and learn the more modern and affordable way to get into being a producer."
3,Funny,This book is more funny than informative. Good for some leisure reading but not for anyone that is trying to find some serious insight on the subject.
4,Entertaining and yet informative,"This book is a little dated but is compelling enough for multiple reads. The sarcastic hyperbole is definitely it's selling point; the information it contains is found in other sources. The ""recipes"" section made me laugh so hard I cried (maybe it was just late at night and I needed a pick-me-up).Entertaining way to learn about filmmaking; not serious enough to be a standalone source of information. Funny enough I purchased it to read again after initially checking book out from the library."
3,good for beginners,"Great book if you've never made a film before...if you've made 1 or a few of them, this is a decent review, but you probably already do all these things. The digital info is a little outdated as it was published in 2000."
1,Worthless,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read, about anything, ever. If you follow some of the advice in this book, you will actually be a worse filmmaker than if you just started bumbling your way through it on your own. (And, some of his advice will land you in jail, if you get caught.)The book is poorly written, incoherent at times, and each short section only conveys the vaguest information possible about the subject it purports to be about. The tone is sarcastic and vaguely insulting. Some of the advice was so stupid I was offended by it. I've read at least fifty books about filmmaking, and this is hands-down the worst. Period. It's hard to comment on the information in much detail, because there is so little depth to the information in this book that it's like reading a ream of blank paper.If you read this book, you'll need to read at least one good one to understand all the vague things, and un-lear all the incorrect things, that you'll hear about filmmaking from this piece of junk."
4,"You gotta be crazy, baby","The 1987 album from Icehouse was the record that broke them in the US, despite a large body of work that was well known Internationally. Iva Davies is a very good vocalist in the Bryan Ferry vein (there are moments when ""Man Of Colors"" starts sounding like Roxy Music, especially the title track). While the songs here tend to be very good (and ""Electric Blue"" became a substantial hit), the synth heavy production sounds very much of the period. However, that won't keep you from being drawn in by the tale of ""The Heartbreak Kid"" and the pop confections of ""Crazy."" John Oates even gave his seal of approval by adding background vocals to ""Electric Blue,"" and you can hear Davies stretching for Daryl Hall/Paul Young moments of soul here as well. If that was the kind of 80's music that got your ears (Roxy, Fixx, H&O), then ""Man Of Colors"" is where you'll find love in the Icehouse."
4,Soaring rock vocals,"I first fell in love with Icehouse' music when I heard No Promises on the radio back in '85 or '86. I found the Measure for Measure album and then got to listen to earlier albums that were more alternative and less radio-friendly. But Man of Colors was a tour de force. It was what I wanted from Icehouse. First came the soaring love ballad, Crazy, then the follow-up Electric Blue, with its snazzy riffs, and finally I got the whole album on tape from an acquaintance in Australia. It was magic. Other songs I enjoy are Girl on the Moon and the epic story-song, Sunset and the Heartbreak Kid, which for me was a kind of sequel to the Eagles' New Kid in Town.This disc is kind of pricey but it's hard to find. I appreciate that they've got extras like extended versions of some songs, but I've heard most of these on other Icehouse albums."
3,"It's OK, but not great","In my opinion, this was Icehouse's least impressive album. I believe this was their attempt at reaching a mainstream U.S. audience - John Oates co-wrote ""Electric Blue"", and Hall & Oates were one of the best-selling U.S. bands of the time. Given that their previous work, Measure for Measure, was produced by Brian Eno and was marvelous, this is a letdown in comparison. Way overproduced and the songs that are meant to sound deep and political come across as somewhat contrived and lacking substance. I'm a huge fan of this band, but this is my least favorite album of theirs."
5,Best Icehouse Ever,"I have listened to this band since I was in my early twenties, and this album always had a special place in my heart. The melodies, the lyrics, even today, decades later, still touch me and bring me right back to my own youth. I love the songs, I love especially the song ""Man of Colors""..its absolutely beautiful, as are so many other tracks. This is a must have dvd. Go get your copy and see why.Annie, USA, 2005"
2,More Compression Madness!!!,"Why Iva, why????After all the complaints from around the world about the ""loudness wars"", including derision from luminaries such as Bob Dylan and you go and jump on the bandwagon and do it to your own back catalogue. They sounded just fine with the 2001 remasters. I bought this with trepidation only to have my doubts confirmed when the first chords of Crazy came CRASHING through my speakers....and on it went for the whole album!!I am going to buy a second hand copy of this from the remasters circa 2001 and hear this fabulous work the way it should be heard - with DIFFERENT harmonics, not ONE LOUD NOISE.Avoid!!!"
4,CD Purchase,"Transaction fine. No problems, just a delya due to purchase coming from U.S, which is expected with this sort of purchase. Thanks"
4,"Icehouse: 1987, the year they made contact","Remember 1987? that year all the big bands released there finest stuff (U2, Midnight Oil, Inxs, George Michael, etc..) well Icehouse was 1 of those bands too! Man Of Colors Starts off w/ the smash hit single ""Crazy"" , Followed by there biggest Hit ""Electric Blue"" , co written by John Oates. Other note worthy singles also fill out this album ""My Obession & Nothing Too Serious"" respectively. The ""Title Track"" is a beautiful ballad & ""The Kingdom"" is a surprise of pop intensity. The only problem I have w/ Man Of Colors is that it sounds too much like sell out. this album is the place to start for ALL new Icehouse fans."
4,Almost perfect...,"Fantastic remaster! Unfortunately, track 1 (Crazy) is the single version, which clocks in at about a minute shorter than the original album version."
5,Excellent replacement motor,I ordered this as an exact replacement for my humidifier motor that sometimes would not start. it was a perfect fit and easy to install. It has been running for about 6 months now and is quiet and does it's job well.
4,TRACK LISTING,1. Club Mix (featuring Notorious B.I.G.)2. Bad Boy Remix (featuring Notorious B.I.G. and Mase)3. Slow Remix4. Club Mix (Instrumental)5. Bad Bor Remix (Instrumental)6. Slow Remix (Instrumental)
3,Second rate Keely Smith,"Toni's voice resembles Keely Smith's. But she lacks sophistication and subtlety. All of these songs are delivered adequately, but there's nothing special about them, and the word painting lacks originality. Nothing wrong with the performances here, but they're not inspirational. Ms Tennille has great diction, though! And that's important. I note that the drummer is Louie Bellson. He sure doesn't get a chance to show his stuff here, though."
5,A Triumph--Albee's Best,"It's unusual for a playwright to produce his or her best work in late-career, but that's what Albee has done in *Three Tall Women.* The essence of Albee's genius has long been his ability to get language to do what he wants, rather than being constrained by what language wants to do. But in *Three Tall Women*, unlike in *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf*, there's something urgent and concrete at stake: what, exactly, was the meaning of a dying woman's ninety-two year life? It's this question that fuels the gripping conflict between the play's three characters, ""A"", ""B"", and ""C"", who represent a single woman at ages 26, 52, and 92.There is so much in *Three Tall Woman* for brilliant actresses to exploit that the play seems virtually certain to be a hot ticket for as long as live theater exists. It's the kind of play that, if properly cast, could sell out the National Theater of Mars, or a similarly remote venue."
4,It's worth reading more than once!,"I am a student actress and Three Tall Women has been my first real script I had to work on. I found the play to be extremly interesting and even though I have read it more than 50 times I have always found something new, and noticed something that I haven't before"
1,Crakerjack toy,"This piece of crakerjack toy i recieved was just that. There was no size on the add,and they made it look so great.i wished I would have read the comments more carefully. I was on vacation when it came so I can't send it back without it costing me a return charge."
3,"nice, but small","I got this originally for my wife, but my daughter loves it so much, and it is about a nice size for a child or teenager..good value for what you get. thx"
4,First Winner for Best Picture,"This movie was the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (Back then, it was called ""Best Production""). Of the 81 movies to win this award, only two are not available on DVD in the United States: Cavalcade and Wings. This product is an import but WILL play on your Region 1 DVD player. Until Paramount decides to officially release this film to DVD, this import is the only way to own this film on DVD. This film is also noteworthy in that it is the only silent picture to win the top prize. Beyond it's historical significance, this movie is very well written and produced. The acting performances are supurb, especially considering that they can't be heard!"
2,The war to end all wars just wouldn't end.,"A rather uninteresting WWI story showing off Gary Cooper and Clara Bow. The best parts are the real dogfight footage cut into the story. Unless you are a Great War fanatic or checking off Best Pictures, don't bother. Due to calendar scheduling, this is considered the Best Picture for the years 1927-28."
3,Not An Official U.S. Release..,"Wings is a great movie and well deserved of the very first ever Academy Award for Best Picture. The problem is it hasn't been released officially in the U.S., and until such time this Korean import version will have to do. While i'm glad to have this film in my ""Best Picture"" collection? I should add that the picture is somewhat grainy, flickers & jumps around quite a bit, and there is no way to turn the annoying subtitles off. Subtitles on a silent movie you ask? Yes there are! As with all silent movies, there are dialogue cards that appear on the film between scenes so that you can read what the actors are saying. And this version has subtitles which repeat the dialogue word-for-word, but not at the same time as the dialogue cards, which means you have to read every word twice, the second time after the film resumes. They're quite distracting to the movie, and the main reason i'm rating this three stars."
2,this shirt is the opposite of BAMF,"Do not waste your money on this shirt. First of all the letters ""BAMF"" are significantly smaller and center more like in the upper stomach region, UNLIKE the picture where it is big across the chest. After the very first wash the letters faded about half of its brightness. The shirt also fits awkard. I have the same body shape as the t-shirt model on the pic..and it doesnt fit like that...just kinda sucks all around!"
5,Beautiful Movie,"This is an informative, calming , beautiful movie. I had never seen beavers in action. Seeing how they take down these tall trees and drag them to the water to build their dams. I could watch this movie everyday. I love watching their sweet family life inside the dam. The courting dance they do on the full moon is the sweetest thing I've ever seen."
4,Beavers,"First saw at IMAX, but had to buy it. Entertaining movie about beavers. Loses a star, because some of the scenes use ""tame"" beavers (from a zoo or something like that)."
1,Terrible Disappointment,"I have never been so compelled to write a negative review. This film is not good, most definitely not educational, and simply irritating. I saw this DVD and thought, ""this is going to be great--an imax film about beavers. How cool is that?"" Well, I was thoroughly disappointed. The beaver footage was obviously setup and did not represent natural behavior; the background music was obnoxious and not fitting; beavers do not make loud moans and actually they make very little noise at all; and the film was too ""done up""--if they would have only filmed the beavers and left it at that! This film was such a let down and a big missed opportunity and cleaver and creative it was not. Do not buy this DVD and if you do, please do not think anything in this film is educational or factual--oh yah, and if you do choose to put yourself through the misery, put the player on mute so you do not have to listen the fake, irritating beaver noises and the obnoxious, ill-suited background music."
4,Spongebob is always good!!,"I like collecting these DVDs of spongebob. My niece and newphew also love watching spongebob and like to watch my DVDs I have of him. If you're a fan of spongebob, you should definitely buy this one! Any spongebob DVD would be a great addition to your collection!!"
2,I have lost faith in Spongebob.,"Spongebob was once a very good cartoon. But since the forth season it's just been getting worse and worse. I think it just finished its sixth season, and frankly I'm surprised it's still going, it's so awful now. It must be because of all the die-hard Spongebob fans out there who refuse to believe that this show is goign down the drain (badump-ch). Really, these new episodes are painful to watch, they're so bad. They're crude and unfunny and tasteless and all that. I used to get excited when I heard new Spongebob episodes were coming out, now I just don't really care. I've moved on to better cartoons, and instead of wasting you're money on this disgraceful dvd, I sugest you do the same."
4,Buen Rock desde Noruega,"Stage Dolls es un disco repleto de buenas canciones e interpretacion, que fue grabado a finales de la decada de los 80''s, este es el tercer trabajo de esta banda (hermana de los fabulosos TNT), y en el cual en un intento de lanzarlos fuerte en los EU, salen temas excelentes como ""Love Cries"" que fue su principal sencillo, ""Still in Love"", ""Mistery"" que demuestran la gran calidad de la produccion y las composiciones que corren principalmente por cuenta del guitarrista y vocalista Torstein Flakne y su amigo Bobby Icon (letras), el trio lo conforman el bajista Terje Storli y el baterista Steinar Krokstad (despues en los estupendos Vagabond de Ronni le Tekro y Jorn Lande) y a lo largo de todo el disco nos recuerdan que la calidad no esta peleada con la melodia y comercialidad. Si te gusta el mejor Hard Rock escandinavo, seguramente no lo debes dejar pasar."
5,Awesome Product,"As with all my other Kershaw knives, this one is also outstanding. I love it. It is now my favorite knife.I carry it everyday. It's light, easy to use,very rugged and well made. You won't be dissapointed withthis knife. I've carried a Kershaw knife for the last 12 years and will carry on the tradition with the Black Blur."
4,Can't beat a kershaw!!!,If your already own a KAI knife then you know what to expect when you purchase a Kershaw pocket knife. The only reason I didn't give this knife a five star rating was because it does not have the quick release on the back of the knife.
5,Great Knife,"I have owned lots of knifes and anymore I only buy kerhaws,this one is one of my favorites. Worth every penny! Free lifetime sharpening also! And lifetime warranty.Overall a great knife!"
4,"Well Built, Solid Knife, Great Grip","PRO:-Super Sharp-Fast One-handed Action-Great Grip (imagine sandpaper covered with a thin layer of rubber)-Non-reflective surface (great for ninjas)-Solid, Sturdy Construction-Made in the U.S.A.CON:-Does not open as fast as some of my Buck assisted opening knivesOverall:This is a great knife for every day carry!"
5,A Thing of Beauty,The first knife I received was defective. It was dull and the blade was off-center (Check your knife to make sure it is centered in the handle or it will strike the side). I just received the replacement in very quick fashion (3days). This new knife is razor sharp and smooth as silk. It is a very well made knife and the blade is centered. A great feel in the hands and opens left or right handed with the thumb studs and the spring assist. It opens in a blur and with authority. Made in the USA!!!
1,dont buy,"Dont buy this is you plan to use it on a boat, the blade rusted very rapidly, send a little more money and get a knife with a titanum blade"
4,great knife!,"I actually bought this knife on a whim...thinking, ""hey, you can ALWAYS use a good knife."" I was right! This is great...it opens quickly, and you can use one hand to do it. Not quite as sharp out of the box as I expected, but I can take care of that myself. It's also not too large. I'm kinda bummed there was no case for it...but overall a great buy!"
5,My first real knife,"This is my first knife purchase that I have put consideration into. I've had pocket knives in the past, but they were just cheap and good for nothing. I decided I wanted a ""good"" knife that I can keep for years and be proud to use.This knife is amazing! I have only owned it for a few hours but I can't put it down. It's god a nice weight to it so you feel it in your hand and I have never seen a blade open assist like this. It literally snaps open with slight thumb pressure. The blade came factory sharp as expected and the craftsmen ship is rock solid. I feel like I am never going to ruin this knife.This is a review from someone who does not know much about knives, but I could have not been happier with this purchase. I would have gladly paid the full retail price if I had known how good this knife was going to be. I say it is a ""no-brainer"" to buy if your looking for a entry level life-long knife."
4,Funny is not a good enough description!,"I watch this over and over, and I still find it as funny as the first time I viewed it. The contains the typically priceless, clever and original humor that Gracie & George were made famous for."
5,#1 Burns and Allen Fan!!,"Burns and Allen is a hilarious show that was produced in the early 1950's. The show is mainly about a man who's wife is crazy. (She's not really crazy it's just some of the stuff she says is.) Someone can say somthing and she will come back with some of the funniest stuff to say. Example In the gracie throws a wedding episod, a women is talking to gracie and tells her she is getting ready to marry a used car salesmen, gracie tells her, well I guess it doesn't matter if he's new or used as long as you love him. You have to understand that yes these shows are old, and there are editing flaws, THEY WERE MADE IN THE 1950'S!!! they didn't have the technology that we have now. My dad and i watch these all the time, and roll laughing. I am 18 years old and love the show, Please don't let some of the bad reviews people have wrote let you miss out on this show."
2,From Contented Cows..,"From contented cows. You might be wondering why I titled my review this way. Obviously from the shows on this dvd, carnation evaporated milk....from contented cows, was the sponsor. During the skits the ""gags"" would stop in mid-stream while one of the actors mentioned the product. In a few episodes they even went as far to demonstrate it's quality. I didn't feel like I was watching a 'Burns and Allen' show, It felt like a long boring commercial for carnation milk.The quality of the picture is ok..just ok. There are parts in a couple of episodes where scenes were snipped together, almost like the films we watched in high school. Remember how those films would break and someone would repair them only to have scenes jumping from one minute to the next. If you are a die hard fan of 'Burns and Allen' I would recommended this dvd if only for the low cost. If you just like 'Burns and Allen' I would recommend that you pass this one by."
4,An Excellent and Comprehensive Primer on CWM,"The overall organization of the book: its introduction of topics, clear and concise definitions and illustrative examples made for easy reading, even for concepts with which I was unfamiliar. The structure, content and motivation for the CWM classes and packages were clearly presented as was their use, interaction, extensibility and applicability through thoughtfully constructed examples.A must read for managers, system architects and software developers grappling with data warehouse integration projects."
5,Just a GREAT recording!,"Track Listing:1. Some Guys (Golde, Hayes) 3:402. To See You Again (Davis, Golde, Hayes, Sitkin) 2:593. The Real Thing (Hayes) 3:464. Coax Me, Chad (Golde, Hayes) 4:045. Time Stands Still (Hayes) 5:366. Soul Love (Hayes, Hayes, Rietveld) 4:177. Skeletons Dancing (Safan) 4:428. Chance on You (Hayes) 3:459. Whole Wide World (Davis, Hayes) 3:5110. Joyful Noise (Hayes) 4:23"
4,A Bit Surprising...,"I love all of David Dorian Ross' Tai Chi DVDs but this one surprised me. Since it was labeled for Seniors, I thought it would be fairly easy to do. I actually found it to be the most challenging of his DVDs and even wondered if his title ""Energy Boost for Seniors"" referred to senior (master) tai chi experts. The kicks left me off balance and I thought that there should have been more references to adapting these moves to seniors who might have some physical issues. It seemed lacking in instruction."
1,Energy Boost for Seniors with Chi,"I am very unhappy with the this DVD, it does not teach you how to do each movement separately. The DVD seems to come from a place that we are suppose to know all about Chi and the particular movements that where put together for the Energy Boost program. Well I am a beginner and it failed miserable with me. It is not a How to DVD!"
3,only for certain seniors,Seniors often have difficulties with balance and this dvd contains two one legged poses. This is surprising since the AM/PM Chi dvd does not contain any. I believe that an exercise video marketed to seniors should not contain one legged standing exercises. That aside the rest of the movements demonstrated would be within the capacity of many seniors
3,Energy Boost for Seniors,"The Tai Chi instruction by David is excellent but tape has too much advertising and other ""junk"" at the beginning. You must sit through several minutes of this forced viewing before you can get to the subject of interest."
4,Good Turkey Platter,"I was given this platter as a thank you for hosting the Thanksgiving dinner. It is big enough to hold a large turkey. It is also quite heavy and storage of such a large, heavy item is sometimes a problem. However, since it is perfect to serve turkey for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, I've made room for it. Good value for the money."
3,"Good, but could be better....","I am a true cirque du soleil fan, and have been following all their soundtracks up to this point and am excited and much looking forward to their future releases...and have loved all their soundtracks up til this one. I don't like the fact that 95% of this recording is vocal. I miss just having the beautfiul insturmental music just drift through your ears. Not enough of it to make me give it a high score. Though the vocals are good. The music is good...This is not their best album in my book. I am really almost disappointed that I bought this cd, the only thing that saved this cd from being putting it up for sale...is Mio Bella Amore. Beautiful song. Other then that...I don't really like this cd as much as I do the other ones. Though I am looking forward to getting Tapis Rouge. That one sounds really good. As for this, I'll keep it...but it won't be played as much. A little too sexy for me."
2,Great Expectations,"I have had the pleasure of seeing Zumanity in Las Vegas and it was both marvelous and quite a departure for Cirque du Soleil. Unfortunately my expectations for this CD were unmet. While I do appreciate the creativity and considerable talent that went into the production of the CD, I had visions of the live show in mind. As a fanatical Cirque du Soleil performances fan, I'm afraid the `Inspired By' compilation just didn't work for me. Cirque du Soliel's live shows leave a fantastic and indelible impression in the mind and imagination of the viewer I doubt seriously that they can effectively capture the essence of the performance with anything less then the original! I will certainly buy the actual `show tunes' CD if it is ever released."
3,"Nice musically, but","The CD is very pleasant, musically, but read the title: This is music /inspired/ by the show, not from the actual show. I'm more than a little disappointed, especially as a former saxophonist, since the music was delightful during the show."
1,umm.... NO,"So I bought this CD years ago, I tried to listen to it and find something I liked and never could. I put it in with all my other CD's and kind of forgot about it till yesterday. I was out in Vegas and went to see the show. This show is amazing took my breath away. All I could think of was ""well... Let's give this CD another try!"" But simply put, go see the show!!! Don't buy the CD. Once they come out with the music from the show get it. Till then a CD like this does the show no justice. Hope this helps."
2,Un-Desireable to me,"For every Cirque show I see, I buy the Program & CD.I really did enjoy the show, style, acts & makeup/costumes...or lack of! ;)But the CD left much to be desired.I guess I was expecting grander music, cirq-ish lyrics.What I got was mostly english-lyrics.Granted- I did like the Tango. Meditation was Ok.But nothing was spectacular.Nothing I would bother downloading had I heard the music first.So of 11 Lyric-ed songs, I liked 2.*shrug*This may be good for some folks, who prefer this style.I guess it just was to far from my flavor of music for me to enjoy it more."
2,"""tarribul. No, oolful."" as Simon Cowell would say...","All of the other Cirque Soundtracks I have (O, Saltimbanco, Solarium/Delirium, Alegria, Quidam, Journey of Man) are absolutely incredible, yet it seems like every artist has at least one outstandingly bad album...and I'm afraid this one is Cirque's worst. All it really is is just dialogue that hardly makes sense, transitional, very short (not even a minute?) tracks in between that are merely just sound effects, and a few tracks after that which end up sounding like kinky elevator music. Not to mention the singer in the first track is horribly out of tune at the first note which is unnaceptable for a recording! All of the other cirque albums as I listed above are INCREDIBLE, but this is the only one I would highly discourage anyone from buying."
1,Worst Cirque CD,"A dirge of a C.D. Not at all like any other Cirque du Soleil music tracks, which have always been excellent."
4,4.3 The saint!,"Great cd. Features the Saints best song in Chemical Euphoria... Out on a limb, Raising fear and Legacy are just awesome songs. A must have for Metal fans and 80's style Saint... Great stuff!"
1,Fun for about 5 minutes... if that.,"There are a lot of things you can do with $19.99 and buying this game should not be 1 of them. Customize your animals? Yes, you get a brown horse, every time, and you can vary it's size, length & sex. Brown & white dogs, black & white cats, vary the size, done. There are about 10 animals to choose from, about 7 toys, a handful of trees, a few shelters, a few toys, etc. Not much selection at all. This game was literally thrown together quick & thrown in the stores. I could poop something more interesting than this game, really. If you're 5 this might be fun more than a couple minutes, otherwise buy some string or rubberbands, you'll have more fun with them! I not only have a low opinion of this game, the company that made it just made my ""do not buy from"" list. What a rip-off!"
1,Hello 1989 graphics!,Bought this on Amazon. Horrible graphics and total lack of scenery combined with creatures that simply jump in place make this a complete waste of time and money. Don't waste the money or even the electicity to install this.
3,The book was darker.,"Although enlightening with a stunning cast, this film lacks the chilling factor of Wurtzel's autobiographical portrait of insanity. She didn't ""come back up"" while in college. Her story is so much longer--sadder--than the plot of the movie picked up. Even the drugs were toned down. The very beginning of the book Prozac Nation, she does meth. I mean, I get the point of cutting some points out of the movie, but I think this killed the soul of her message, because it is a dark story and toning it down doesn't do it justice.If you've read the book, be warned: you'll get a cutesy ending with little recognition of Wurtzel's words."
3,Ricci In Ricci Out,"I try to catch as many movies of Christina Ricci as I can being a fan of hers. There's a small handful I enjoy and most of the others are just so-so. For me Prozac Nation falls into the so-so category. For starters, aside from the story or performance, Christina seems to be in between her ""chubby"" state and her latter very thin state. I prefer her fuller-figured frame but the look in this movie is well balanced for her.For the movie itself, I just couldn't really get into it. It wasn't horrible to watch but after one viewing I had no desire to watch it again anytime in the future. I feel Ricci did what she could for the role but the story is lacking. In addition to the movie, there is an extra feature called 'Anatomy of a Scene'(19:41). You also get Engish and Spanish subtitles as well as spoken language."
1,typical anguished whoa is me boredom,"Christina Ricci narrates in a monotone voice how awful her life is. But looking at it, she has a very fortunate life, and you just wanna smack her and tell her to come down off the cross.There is nothing unusual or dramatic about her life. She is simply a snob who feels sorry for herself because she expects perfection. Poor Jessica Lange stars as the mother. Jessica looks like she is trying to doing an impersonation of Faye Dunaway doing Joan Crawford. And why is Ricca nude on the cover of the DVD? This had nothing to do with the film..I think the director knew he had a stinker and thought maybe this cover shot would help sell it.."
1,any hope for ricci,Listen!i watch & own many Christina Ricci filmsevery time i wish the next film will be better than the nextthat just isn't the caseall her films seem to s^ckexcept buffalo 66& addams familyoh wellmaybe she's the next TRAVOLTAsee you in ten yrs.
2,I changed the channel,Unless you want to sit around and be depressed then you may want to bypass this movie. Nice opening nude scene of Ricci but after that just a bunch of depressing scenes. Not my cup of tea. I've seen people handle worse.
1,Narcissism Valorized.,"The reason this movie is so popular among the depressives writing here is that it actually endorses Prozac at the end, which is, well, a complete betrayal considering that the title promises to expose Prozac as a problem.I recommend reading Christopher Lasch's Culture of Narcissism before watching this movie. Actually, I recommend reading Lasch's book and then not watching this movie."
3,"Okay, but Book is probably Better","I thought this movie was okay, not on my Top 5, but it was good. I am sure the book is probably better."
2,I wasn't depressed before I saw this movie but I may be now!,"When I saw the cast for this movie, I was really excited. But the roles were played waaaaay to dramatic.I admit I haven't read the book, but I am familiar with the topic. I guess I thought there would be a little more hope at the end.By the end of the movie, I wanted to slit my wrists!"
4,It is sad that people have to live this way!,Ricci did a trarific job with acting like she had this problem. I have a new appreciation of there plight.
4,Very good,"Prozac Nation was a good movie C. Ricci I have to give her some props she has proven to be a very good actress I've seen her in a few movies and she always seems to bring out her character's. She has that look about her . The movie over all was a good movie the only parts that got a little carried away was when her and the lady that played her mother would get in talks or arguments they got a bit carried away with that, but I'm sure it was big part in that lady's book so they had to bring that out. But over all a very good movie worth the money to see."
5,Ricci is amazing,I have an ex girlfriend who is a dire depressant and I totally remember the mood swings and we had the same argument as in the movie about her thinking that I wanted to sleep with someone else. Christina Ricci is a superior actress and she nailed this role perfectly.
3,A re-release of this film?,"I'm not sure as of when,perhaps a couple of years it seems,that this movie was orginally released on a small scale as an indie film in select theatres and now,accordiing to this site,it's what,a debut or something?How about offering an explanation as to what the hell is going on with this film?contraversy?Distribution problems?Movie goers such as myself would love to know.More importantly,will it ever be released for dvd?Speaking of which,what exactly does ""limited release"" mean?By the way,I have never seen the film,but I gave it 3 stars,as I had the pleasure of viewing Christina Ricci's breasts from a vid-clip on celebritymoviearchive.com"
1,True Story? What Story?,"My wife and I kept waiting for the ""true story"" actually develope into some type of plot. I tend to enjoy independent films and think Ricci is a fine actress; but believe me, there is a good reason that this film went strait to video."
3,Vincent Gallo as a chick.,"Decent acting, but this forgettable memoir has all the gravitas of a Darlene-heavy episode of TV's Roseanne. The narcissism of this story is so advanced it appears oblivious to what a pedestrian diary of teenage angst it's reading from. Liz does something bad and gets yelled at. She yells back, then feels bad and cries. This describes nearly every scene. Mental illness has been done, and done better, on film. This ain't all that deep. Go watch ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" if you need to push this junk out of your brain."
3,An interesting movie,"Personally not the most engaging for me, but Ricci's performance was really good. An interesting movie that's worth a look, and was worth a shot at the big screen."
2,Lost Time,"Granted, I've not read the book. It seemed that the film left out vital parts of the story, or it was poorly edited/directed. It just seemed really choppy and inconsistent. The value of the plot is immense, I just didn't think that as a package the film delivered it well. The acting was great, though I constantly found myself thinking that Michelle Williams looked so much older than the rest of her peers that the illusion of college was broken for me. I wanted the film to be this deep commentary on our sanctioned drug culture via the mental health audience and I never felt that it got there. It was more a noncommital nontreatment of mental conditions."
1,Pass on this one,"Just more regurgitated stories. Evidence. Really??? If this is the best evidence then ""Houston, we have a problem."" Believing on faith is one thing but trying to tie it all together with this stuff is nausiating."
2,a lot of mistakes,"I was intially really excited after reading this book. But then after I started looking up the claims he makes in the book on FARMS and what not, there are a LOT of mistakes. A LOT. I was very disappointed. I think he got most of his information from Hugh Nibley and didn't research anything on his own. When reading this book you need to take all the info with a grain of salt and look up the information yourself to see if what he is saying is remotely plausible."
4,Good Video,The delivery time was great. I got when I expected. I only gave 4 stars because the quality of the image. The different strokes had helped me to broad the kind of massages I give. The explanations are great as well. You can tell the video was made for VHS and then made in DVD.
3,Over discriptive.,"When I am told of the process and what it is for, I would expect to move on. Instead you are subjected to minutes upon minutes of the procedure being preformed with no other vocalization. I found this to be boring and actually quiet annoying."
3,Massage Therapy for Professionals,"I expedited a better quality for a DVD, not a VHS tape copied straight to a DVD. There was no menu or sub-menus. The massage technique shown was good."
4,could (should?) have been finished better,"i've seen this licensed replica sword at cons so knew what to expect but thought these issues should be mentioned.the pommel has some unevenness in the finish and the blade has what look like machining blemishes (scrapes in the metal). the inscriptions on the blade have a good number of defects.i would expect a quality display piece to have been finished better. if you've ever seen a U.S. Mint proof coin, you know what i'm talking about.it feels nice and heavy and looks great except for the items mentioned above.it appears that the gold design on the grip is paint (done quite well) so i suspect that with enough handling (it's primarily for display, of course but who's not going to ""play"" with it a bit) it'll start wearing off.overall, i like it a lot and have no plans to exchange it.LOTR Hadhafang Sword of Arwen, Wood Grip Handle"
5,Excellent craftsmanship,I bought one of these a while back. I love it! If you are thinking about buying one I recommend doing it asap. United Cutlery is no longer making this sword so they are going to be hard to find very soon.
3,Good for display only.,"I bought this from a shop named Caesars in Singapore.Just want to say about this product from united cutlery, this item has bad paint work.The golden paint on the blade itself is badly done, I seem other distributor selling the same item,it seem to be the same, so I'm sure it's a common thing, but if u really love it, u wouldn't mind it.Secondly the pertruding hood like part on the front and back of the blade is not evenly madethe weight distribution on the sword, makes it difficult to handle,the C of G should be make closer to the grip or the grip sure be made longer for better double hand holding.I see traces of glue from where the handle and blade jointed, so I'm assuming it's attached by just gluesame goes for the pommel.if u grip the sword very often, soon the paint work on the grip will wear off"
1,DISAPPOINTED,This was a gift. When it was opened the sword needed cleaning. I think we received a USED one passed off as new. Some of the stains wouldn't come out. I would have returned it if I had had the time before the birthday. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! I can't take the gift away to send it back or I would do that also.
4,Hadhafang Sword,"I'm a big lord of the rings fan and this sword is beautiful! If you don't know, Arwen's name MEANS ""Noble Lady"" so, it appears that the sword is inscribed ""This sword is made for Arwen."""
2,Not Worth It,"When I bought Renegade Racers I was looking forward to a fun easy to learn game the would entertain me. Oh how i was wrong, first off it is incredibly hard to install and crashed on the install the first three times. I have a Pentium 2, P300 with a Voodoo3 2000 so I was not expecting any problems but they still continued, upon loading the game I found that the game actually started 1/3 times. Now the game itself was about what I expected, nothing spectacular but I returned the damn thing on general purposes because I wasn't patient enough to keep reloading my computer. Buy something else because this is not worth it."
5,Can't stop reading.,"This is a great book loaded with information. This first few chapters makes you ask yourself the question is flying for you. He will go over the risks, costs, and types of questions someone looking into learning to fly is thinking. The author uses the 'She' pronoun for everything related to a flyer which is interesting, this might be because his favorite flight instructor was infact a woman, or this might be to be differnt from pretty much every other flying book. The book is very captivating and does have great illustrations... i've been reading it for hours on end."
2,Sticky and poorly stitched,"This ball seemed pretty good at first. It has a classic design that resembles higher-priced balls. But compared to several other moderately priced soccer balls, like the Adidas F50, Teamgeist II and even cheaper balls from Brine and Wilson, this is a poor ball. First, the cover is very sticky, which makes it difficult to dribble. It's discouraging for younger players who are just learning footwork, because the ball sticks instead of sliding or rolling. Kids end up tripping on it more than they would a different ball. Second, the stitching came loose in one section after only a couple of months of light use. Maybe it was just this ball, but if it's an indication of the overall quality of this model's construction, buyers shouldn't expect to get more than a season out of it--at best. I wouldn't buy this ball again. However, I have another model Diadora (Cobra) and it's excellent."
5,Great ball,"Arrivted quickly as usual, so no problems there. It even came with some basic instructions on how to make sure the ball gains its correct shape when pumping it up. I've used a lot of soccer balls over the years, and it is as good as any I have played with; good touch and control. Plus, I think it looks awesome in red. The price is also great considering I'm sure it will last at least a few years of consistent use."
4,Great Ball except...,"it was shipped deflated and came with no ball pump. However, once I found a pump, the ball is great and the kids love how they come in all choices of colors... I have the purple/white one and the red one. The red one is the favorite. The purple one seems lighter than pictured and is a great color for a girl.I love the fact that I can order soccer stuff on-line and not have to bother going into the crowded stores during soccer season."
2,A lot of wrong ideas,"Granted this book is 17 years old, but he was wrong on a lot of things. He would be kicked out of the Republican Party today, but he would embrace the Tea party"
5,Who Knew?,"Blossom Dearie is incredible, this CD is also....I wish I had heard of her before she died recently."
4,"Diva Series, Blossom Dearie","This item never arrived. The seller has asked me to wait until the end of the month and if it has not arrived by then, he will reimburse me. He does not have another copy of this cd in stock.Diva Series"
3,faded Blossom,"sorry, i've enjoyed Blossom Dearie in the past, I like her unusual little voice, but found this album totally boring."
2,"Ok, but I was expecting something different","There are 2 workouts on this DVD - one for back health and one for upper body. However, I was expecting something entirely different. I think I was expecting a vinyasa workout with a focus on upper body and back strength.Plus, this is supposed to be a video for beginners. But, I am experienced at yoga and I can't even do some of these moves. Wheel!? I took yoga for over a year and didn't have enough strength to do Wheel pose! I think this could be very intimidating for newbies who dont' understand that it's OK to not be able to do some exercises. And no alternate modified poses were offered in it's place.Ye is a calming instructor, but I don't love this video for more than light stretching."
2,NOT for beginners,"Despite the fact that it says it's for beginners, it's not. Many of the poses are very difficult for someone with little yoga experience."
4,LT continues to evolve,"I saw LT live several times back in the 80's. Loved them. Over the years I managed to collect most of their stuff on CD and was excited when The Sky At Night appeared out of nowhere. FF a few more years and we have a couple of really different new releases. Are they quirky and noodly-doodly ""psychedelic porch funk"" like a lot of earlier LT albums? Nope. But they are still excellent.I've always had a soft spot for progressive rock from well before I knew what ""genre"" meant. I just knew what I liked and that included Kansas, Yes, Genesis, and Rush...and now the new LT in their own way. Black Hole didn't grab me on first listen until I got to Electric Chair (which gives me chills). But then along came tracks 7-10 which are stunning. After several more listens I like the whole package, but the last half (Side B?) is still my favorite.Packrat"
3,"Different, but not Love Tractor","Yes, times change and so do some bands, but folks enjoy the signature sound of a band for a reason. If you wanted a different sound, you'd listen to another band. I've given this CD a good ten plays so I can say my disappointment is not made in haste. Don't get me wrong, there's some good stuff on this CD, especially the first and last tracks, but not enough of the ""Sky At Night"" Love Tractor to save it, in my opinion. Obviously the departure of several of the band members have changed the sound chemistry and I can't say I'm pleased with it."
3,This Ain't No Love Tractor,"Black hole, indeed. Without Armistead Wellford and Mark Cline's creative input and original sounds its just not the same 'band'. Their contributions were an essential to all of their albums all the way to 'Sky at Night'. Sure the original line up did change drummers a couple times, but over the course of 20 years it was always the same three guys on guitars and bass.I give Mike and his new group credit, the album has it's moments, and I wouldn't be here if I didn't appreciate Mike's work; hence the three stars. But it seems very disrespectful to die hard fans and the old members to capitalize on their name. Why not just come up with a new name for a new project?"
5,Great Gift!,"I think this is the funniest collection of cartoons yet! It's nice to see the traditional style of The New Yorker cartoons up against modern technology. And, not to mention, it's been a great gift with all the gadget-freak men in my life!! My father has been bringing his to meetings and my boyfriend got one for his Computer Science teacher! Congrats to those who own one."
4,Great Debut Album but Dang Those Big Music Execs!,"My apologies for my strong language in the title but it erks me when music ""experts"" try to ""fix"" songs and albums. This is one of the reasons this album sort of disappeared into obscurity. Nonetheless, ""5:30..."" is a fantastic album because Lennon Murphy's presence is so overpowering. I give this album 4 stars because of three 5-star songs (""Couldn't Breathe,"" ""My Beautiful,"" and ""5:30 Saturday Morning"") otherwise I would have had to give it 3 stars. The other songs are good but there is a manufactured feel to them. ""5:30..."" is the best song on the album because its just Lennon & the piano, no chance for manufacturing here! ""My Beautiful"" is a great song even though Lennon herself wasn't happy with it. She even remakes it on a future album but, personally, the remake isn't as good. ""Couldn't Breathe"" is a wonderfully powerful and dynamic song."
5,Best Album of the year!,"Buy this album, Lennon is not only beautiful but talented. I try and find new unheard bands and this one is well worth its price. If your heart is broke, if you are angry or just want to have fun then this album is for you."
5,damn,and i say again damn. Lennon Murphy has got to be one of the best artiats i have ever heard. i really like the song i hear. she wrote it very well. if your thinking about getting a new cd to play anywhere get this one.
5,Lennon Is The Successor to Alanis,"Having seen the Video for ""Brake of your Car"", had to run out and hear if this girl was for real...and she is...She's got the spunk that Alanis Morrisette has but is much easier on the eyes...and has a much more refined vocal quality...Every track has its own lil hook...and the Title Track brings back a vivid reality that sexuality isn't dead...It just lies beneath the starched surface of this new moral era. Bravo Girl...you go!!!"
4,An exellent start for a talented girl,"Overall i loved this cd! I would encourage everyone who is a fan of hard rock to buy it. Among the best songs on the cd were ""break of your car"" and ""property of a goat@#$%er"". I hope she comes out with more music in the future"
4,"deep, explosive debut","Most critical reviews of Lennon's debut, 5:30 Saturday Morning, pay close attention to her age, which is all of 19 years old. However, what really needs to be observed, is the passionate, versatile vocals this young woman possesses. She writes all of the tracks on this album, but don't throw her into the category with Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple, and the like. The first track features heavy, downtuned guitars, a prime signature of a nu-metal band. This, however, is NOT a nu-metal album. The sound is something along the lines of Alanis Morrissette meets Marilyn Manson with a touch of Nine Inch Nails. Lennon has also succeeded in making an album that is not monotonous, as there are a number of extremely well-written ballads on this album. 5:30 Saturday Morning is an exceptionally strong debut album from Lennon, who the buying public needs to stop overlooking if she can continue to produce albums of this caliber."
2,from the auf der maur school of trite,"If you appreciate originality and absolutely hate finding a CD that is 90% filler that should have been left in the recording studio, then do NOT buy this cd. I was incredibly disappointed. I was slogging through this thing for about the fifth time, trying desperately to gain some sort of appreciation for it, and I realized I was rolling my eyes every few minutes-- the lyrics are that bad. There are absolutely a couple of tracks that I enjoy, but ultimately all they do is emphasize that this really isn't an album's worth of music."
5,Lennon,"In a time when the majority of teen recording artists are singing to the cookie cutter beats and synthesized sounds of pop music, Lennon bursts onto the scene with a fresh sound. With her from-the-soul lyrics, Lennon has reached a level of maturity at the age of 19 that most people will never accomplish. Since the day I bought the CD almost a month ago, I haven't been able to go 24 hours with out playing her music. The CD covers a wide range of music from the heavy metal sounds of ""Property of Goat...."" to the beautiful piano melodies of ""Asking You"". If you're a fan of good quality music and lyrical genius, this CD is for you."
5,Lennon Is The New Queen,"Lennon... her style is original... her sound is unavoidable. Lennon Murphy's new album 5:30 Saturday Morning pounds extreme emotions into thoughtful words and backs them up with many different genres of music. Property of Goat*... enters into the sort of thrash metal music category, while the ballad My Beautiful is a testament to all women. Lennon is an extremely talented artist and i know that I look forward to seeing more if her in teh future."
5,ring,I love this ring. We ordered it to go with my engagement ring which has baguettes on the side and it looks great! I will soon be ordering another one to put on the other side. Love it! And the fit was right on!
5,Perfect,This ring will be perfect for our Civil Union ceremony and 10th Anniversary next year. The price was right and the quality is top-notch.
4,Beautiful Book,"I am planning to do home exchanged in the USA, I get offers from places I don't know. This book gives me a good idea of those places and makes me want to go out and travel the USA."
5,Always use Eyewitness books when we travel.,"We do a lot of traveling all around the world and we always use the Eyewitness books. We take them with us for reference. We read all about where we are going prior to the trip. The pictures and the information are fabulous.We recently returned from Egypt and purchased this one as a gift for our tour guide in Egypt, Eman. She was wonderful. When the turmoil in Egypt is over we will mail it to her."
5,Useful purchase,Have used this book before when travelling around the USA and found this book to be very helpful-details of places to visit are superb reason for the purchase of a new book is we have given the old one to family who are travelling the USA this year.
2,Coast to Coast condensed,I was expecting a travel guide with more inclusive things to do rather than a condensed version of the things that most tourists do when they go to major cities. I ended up returning the book because I would rather pay $4 in shipping than almost $20 for a book I wasn't going to use.
2,"I loved this book, but this edition ....","The story itself was a five-star story. But contrary to the claims here, this is *not* the controversial edition. The interracial marriage between Lucy and Juba is omitted and changed. Also this edition has many typos."
5,Silver Polished 1LT Insignia Set,The Silver Polished 1st Lieutenant Officer Insignia Set is absolutely beyond compare. I'm definitely very satisfied and I'll be doing business with this vendor again. Thanks!
5,Still unified mystery to me,"A God Who could be dissected into Constituent Parts wouldn't be much of a God. Indeed, resistance to the idea of a Trinitarian Deity historically has probably had this motive behind it. That Williams' book enriches our understanding of the Holy Spirit with thoroughness and grace and enhances our sense of mystery and unity within the Divine Trinity at the same time is witness to his skill and commitment as a Biblical scholar. The reader has access within these pages to careful research and honest evaluation in a subject full of potential controversy and dissension among the Christian community. Questions of application follow explication; this is characteristic of Williams' writing. To be good is to be good for something and that this is."
5,A Real MC,"It has taken me a while to get over the high pitched voice. But there is no denying Braille's skills as an emcee, and his ability to surround himself with top notch producers. This album is much better than his last effort (which was a pretty good album!) and even better than LightHeaded's last album. to top it all off, instead of becoming more generic and secular, he focuses his message more on his faith in Jesus Christ than ever before. A must have not just for christian hiphop heads but also for real hip hop fans"
5,Elchim best hair dryer on the market,"It's no mystery why most professional hairdressers use this traditional non-ionic dryer. Its multiple heat and air flow options let you dry your hair quickly and effectively, without the undue noise of the ionic dryers in and around this price range. You'll get a good return on your investment with this wonderful product."
4,Good,It is a really good Hair dryer. Be careful that it may burn your head while brow drying your hair since its heat and power are extremely powerful.
3,Mostly happy,"This hair dryer is not as powerful as I expected it to be, even on the highest setting. The attachment helps to direct the air flow, without that I would be pretty frustrated."
3,a little heavier than expected,"My wife has Fibromyalgia and thick hair. Not a good combination when it comes to washing and drying it. I purchased this particular hairdryer on the recommendation of her stylist as being lighter than many other brands. It is not unfortunately. So it will be a gift. It is probably a fabulous dryer, but do to it's weight it was unusable for us."
2,Somewhat satisfied,I was extremely satisfied with the actual merchandise but I was unhappy with the condition of the box it came in. The box was broken halfway through so I was unable to give it to someone as a gift as I originally planned.
4,A continuation of first semester calculus,"This video presents material using comedy, visual effects and a group of actors. Topics coverd include: critical points, local extrema, concavity, min/maximum problems, position - velocity - acceleration functions, antiderivatives, Reimann Sums, definate integrals area between two curves and substitution. The integration techniques used are the basic techniques covered in first semester calculus. It is a good tool to use in conjunction with class, study and homework."
5,Great Holiday or any time,"Came just as advertized. On time, well packaged, like new. It was a gift for my husband and he really enjoyed it. But frankly I play it even more than he does, the music is just so beautiful."
4,Pleasant Enough Listening,"My CD (same cover, same title) has a different selection of songs. It has:TarallyrWhat Child Is This?The First NoelDeck The HallsGod Rest Ye Merry, GentlemenOh, Come, All Ye FaithfulThe Angel of DonegalThe Holly and the IvyThe Spanish CloakHark, the Herald Angels SingAve MariaOver the Sea to SkyeGood King WenceslasAmazing GraceWe Three KingsI Wonder As I WanderAuld Lang SyneFortunately, for my taste, it has more celtic flavor than St. Clair's other ""Celtic Christmas: A Holiday Odyssey."" They achieve this by using the bagpipe on most tunes. Unfortunately the playing is fairly routine with all the songs sounding curiously alike."
3,Bell ant guard,"Works like a charm for keeping ants at bay. The only negative is the S hooks included with the bell. But they are a significant negative. They are too small to hang directly on a shepherd's hook, so you need to hang them from a larger S hook. That coupled with the fact that it can be difficult to hang a feeder from the bottom one makes the hanging process a real challenge. Making matters worse is that they fall off the bell very easily. The first time I tried hanging the bell with my feeder attached, I not only spilled a significant amount of the hummingbird nectar, I also lost the S hook that hangs from the bell's clanger in the foliage beneath my shepherd's hook. To prevent a recurrence, I tried using pliers to tighten the tiny hooks onto the bell, but that doesn't work either because they are so small. I ended up going to the hardware store and buying larger S hooks to replace the bell's inadequate ones."
3,Requires petroleum jelly!,"I bought this for my hummingbird feeder ant problem. I was sold by the claim that it doesn't require messy salad oil or water to work. ""Great!"", I thought. Sadly, it still requires the use of arguably messier petroleum jelly on the inside of the bell. I end up with the jelly all over my hands while i'm trying to unhook/hook the hummingbird feeder to refill it. However, it does seem to keep the ants at bay, and for five bucks, it's not worth returning it. If I could go back in time though, I'd probably have ordered a simpler ant moat that just uses water."
4,Great book wish there was more,Bought this book for ideas on building recumbent bikes. Its a great book with plenty of interesting bikes pictured. I only wish they would publish an 2008 version. this one came out in 2001 but still reads very current.
2,Not for beginners,"This is not a book for beginners, trust me I am one. There are different types of chess notation and this book uses an earlier type. Its hard enough for me to remember what e4+? means without having to figure RKB7 is. After the first chapter this book turns into alphabet soup.I gleaned a few valuable pointers from the text and this may be a wonderful book. Unfortunately I will have to wait until I learn the proper notation system to determine that."
5,Excellent Symantic/Logical Explanation of Chess,"The greatest teaching tool I have read so far. Horwotiz is obviously a great teacher. Chess is a logical game. It needs to be explained in a logical manner. This books tells you what needs to happen and why. After that, it shows you simple examples of how to make it happen. This book explains in detail, why each move is being made and how it corresponds to the symantics of the current subject matter. The particular version I have is written in the old notation (KN -> KB3). This certainly did not hinder it as a superb learning tool."
3,Chess For Beginners,"This book is very simply written, & would be excellent were it updated to algebraic equation rather than descriptive."
5,A beautifully mastered ablum with incredible jazz ensambles.,"Keiki Matsui sucessfully brings together both classical and jazz music in this album my implementing both instrumental songs AND oral words into her music. A ""must have"" Cd for those who enjoy relaxing on the beach for hours watching the ocean, and listening to music. Bravo!"
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"This is the ""must"" for everyone who loves beautiful music. Keiko's piano just shines! Her music cleanse your mind and relax you after a long stressful day. Garden is my favourit even though it reminds me of someone else. It is a good example of East meets West. I strongly recommend this album if you enjoy fusion."
5,I Love Keiko,"For me, listening to Keiko's music is one of the best ways to enjoy life. I've bought many of her albums. Sapphire is as pleasing."
4,Wonderful performance piece,"Not only does this piece contain a wonderful performance of Boccherini's Good Friday mass, it marks a vast improvement over some of the other DVDs in this series. The camera work here is stellar compared to some of the other static examples in other installments. The audio and the performances are vastly improved as well. Dragoni is clearly deserving of her acclaim.Based on reviews I've read on other sites, I'm pleased that Amazon's reviewers are substantially better educated in this genre. No, this is NOT a music video, so if you are easily bored by a musical performance that lacks pyrotechnics and dancers, move along. But in terms of ""documenting"" a classic performance of sacred music, this is among the best."
5,Works well,"I was looking for a vertical holder, but wasn't able to find one I liked so I purchased this one. It seems rather sturdy and does a good job of holding in the rest of the stack when you pull out the top napkin."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is one of those self-published books which are basically the equivalent of a physical blog. Awful writing, nothing intellectual or interesting - in fact, I'm sure there are plenty of blogs out there that are much, much better than this. The one star is for the lovely illustrations, very much in the Pauline Stuckey style. Only a Stevie Nicks completist would get anything out of this pamphlet."
2,Slightly usefull,"I give this book 2 stars because several sources were listed that I found interesting, mainly because I'm a Stevie Nicks collector and love to look for magazine articles on her at eBay. This book names several magazine articles featuring Stevie. Unfortunately, this is the only place the author gets his info. His closest Stevie connection is a woman who would run occasional errends for Stevie. The book reads like a first grade book report on someone famous. The author seems like a huge Stevie fan, but not a real journalist. The pictures are worth more than the words, but it's not marketed as a ""Stevie Photo Book""...."
2,I am a huge Stevie fan but I was very dissapointed....,"The pictures are great but the content is so empty. The book is under 100 pages and not much of it is text. Everything Wincentsen discusses is redundant. You will finish the book asking yourself the same question before you read the book...""Could Stevie be a witch?"""
1,Don't even bother,"This book has less information than your average Stevie Nicks fan site. It is a waste of money. Very little information, just a lot of rambling about Stevie's mystical yearnings, most of which are assumed by the writer. Almost no biographical information. The book itself, and the photos, are poor quality, very inexpensively done. They put the worst photo of Stevie they could find on the cover. Go figure. The whole book yammers on about Stevie's mystical vision, in a sophomoric manner. I'd be embarrassed to say I was the author. As it is I'm embarrassed that I purchased it."
2,Disappointed,"I received both Stevie books for christmas. Like all the other reviews say, the pictures ARE the best part of the book. Some facts are not straight. These books kind of upset me, but like any other fan , I had to have them. These books do not offer any information on Stevie, so if you want some good pics, get them. But look for information some where else."
2,"Great photos, and that's about it","I purchased this book as well as ""Lady of the Stars"" and the books are practically identical. The text is awful, the advertisements are everywhere, but the photos are wonderful...great for a Stevie Nicks fan to have. So I suppose that the book is worth having, but only for the photos."
2,Misleading trickery sells big but produces little....,"I was largely disappointed, expecting prehaps more biographical information in conjunction with the interesting photos...However i found that embarrassingly again i was thirsting for some real vision on the Nicks plight and history rather than the bubble gum machine, typical saddening results i reviewing with every turning of a page..Ha! Ya got me! But not my respect..."
1,Inaccurate,"I found this book to be disappointing and inaccurate. The writer attempts to analyze the lyrics to the song Gold Dust Woman, but has the lyrics wrong. This made me question everything else printed in the book. True Nicks fans - don't waste your time."
1,Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover 2,"I purchased this program thinking that I would save time, money and heartache by making sure what a hairdo and/or color would look like on ME before taking the final step. There are not actually nearly as many ""hairdos"" as advertised since the only change may be the bang to the right or the left. The haircolors were totally unrealistic. They resemble that spray on stuff you use at Halloween. As for the makeup section, it's virtually impossible to apply the makeup to the picture in a smooth coverup. It's blotchy to say the least. The only good feature I found was that it was very easy to make the hairdos, hats, glasses, etc fit any picture and it's equally as easy to position the articles."
2,A ponderous film to watch,"What do you get when you combine some of Hollywood's best talent? In the case of The Good Shepherd, you get a really boring film with a multitude of problems. With multiple confusing flashbacks, a myriad of characters whom we never get to know in any depth, and more than 2 and 1/2 hours of watching Matt Damon look really, really serious to the accompaniment of really, really dreary background music, you end up with a perfect cure for insomnia. Not once did I care about any of the characters, which is critical to the success of this film. They all seemed to be moving underwater, which is a good analogy to describe the pace of the film. Intellectually, I got the point of what the characters did, why they did it, and the gut-wrenching nature of their actions, but it never hit me in the gut. Had HBO done this as a 10 to 12 hours mini-series, I believe it would have worked wonderfully because they could have fleshed out the characters."
1,alternative,"try ""The Company"", from TNT. More accurate portrayal of what really happened in the CIA's early days.I wish I could travel back in time so I could stop myself from watching this movie and go get a cow branding on my a*s instead."
3,Just average across the board,"Everything from the plot, dialogue, directing, and acting is just average. Matt Damon's character is beyond boring, Angelina Jolie wasn't needed, and the other top actors just have bit roles that don't amount to much. Like another review here mentioned, the deaf girl was by far the best and most interesting character. When your watching a movie about the birth of the CIA, you expect a little action, especially in a three hour film."
2,NOT A BLIND-BUY RECOMENDATION FOR SURE,"Long and boring movie full of un-appealling roles for its stars. Some people have praised Matt Damon's performance but the fact his he uses the exact same expression for the three hours this thing lasts. His aging makeup (as well as Jolie's) is just plain ridiculous (does anybody really believe that's how they will look in their '50s) and his son looks just about the same age as him.With apologies for the comparison but a week ago I saw the un-ambitious and inconsequential ""Music and Lyrics"", that is a film that aims low and achieves what it sets to do. This one aims high and totally fails. Personally I'd rather watch the first type."
1,only cia mind tricks could make someone give this 5 stars,"This movie stank. It was boring, so boring I would rather have watched a cia agent pick their nose for three hours. the story was slow, some of the facts fictionalized, and the filming shakey. The skull and bones stuff is somewhat on target with the founding, i would argue, but the rest of it is just bad. There were too many possible storylines that could have been followed, but were not. They just hung there for a little bit and were ignored. simply very, very bad."
1,zzzZZZZZ,"this movie has zero excitment, only watch if you love a boring drama. Definite waste O' Time. Zero stars if I could."
2,Boring!,"I own and enjoy all genres of movies. However, this one is so dull and boring that it could put an ADHD child to sleep! Despite several attempts...out of respect for the all-star cast, I can not get through the movie."
4,Matt Damon is Flawless,"I have read that a good actor/actress can express sad, angry, or elated emotions but it takes a great one to express nothingness. Damon plays his emotionless character to perfection. Billy Bob Thornton is another that is phenomenal at this type characterization (see 'Levity' or 'The Man That Wasn't There').I get that some people didn't have the patience for this movie, the first hour is slow and I myself wanted to fast forward through some scenes. You really cannot for you'll miss several key effects that come up later. I'm also not a big fan of movies that jump around in time, so be sure and pay attention to the date that pops up now and again. For these few reasons I took away one star that would have otherwise made this a most favorite 5 star movie to recommend."
3,"Befuddled, Bothered and Bewildered","Robert DeNiro has an obvious affection for the existential spy drama, ala John Le Carre or Len Deighton. Ronin, which he coproduced was a respectable entry into the field until director Frankenheimer succumbed to filming the ultimate urban car chase. The Good Shepherd attempts to cram a whole shelf of spy novels into a single narrative. The thin plot defies logic. Why Matt Damon's character who has no character is entrusted with so much is implausible. Why his spy character isn't lying at the bottom of the Thames with Michael Gambon's is a mystery. And no one seems to age in this movie except Alec Baldwin and Matt Damon's son. Thirty or forty years pass and everyone looks the same. Just another day at the CIA. This movie is a mess!"
2,Booorrrrring.,"Rent, do not buy, this movie. Glad I rented it and removed it from my wish list before purchasing. Matt Damon sleepwalks through his role, with very little dialog. Ms. Jolie is terribly mis-cast as the pregnant girlfriend/wife, but does her best with her role. Lots of flashbacks, which are not always clearly communicated to the viewer. I won't bother going over the story (which was told much better in ""The Company"" by Robert Littel (warning - get this in paperback -- it's a long but engaging story).And I thought the DaVinci Code was the most boring movie ever made . . ."
2,BAD TRANSFER,"The two stars is for crackling and stoppages, too bad to continue. I never saw the movie. NOTE: The price paid was $3.99?"
3,Early days of the Cold War,"Larry King calls this ""The best spy movie ever""; I don't know about that, but it's definitely worth a look.The story takes place in the early days of the Cold War, when many ignoble things were done in the name of a noble cause. Who can be trusted? ...I dunno. It's like my old roommate used to say: ""I don't trust anyone except me and you, and I'm not too sure about you.""Good production values and acting make up for a story that kind of meanders around.Rated R for ""some violence, sexuality, and language""."
3,Enjoyed the movie,"Even though this movie got mixed reviews, I still went to watch it and enjoyed it. Now that it is out on DVD I can add it to my collection, and I only buy DVD's of movies that I enjoy."
2,zzz,"too long, boring at times, hard to follow. zzzz. Ilike Matt Damon and all of the actors, I appreciated the history lesson, but a bit of a snoozer."
3,OK but slow moving,"I like Matt Damon movies. But, this one moves slowly. It was more intellectual than entertaining. If Matt Damon or another superstar were'nt the primary character, it would be a bust for me. Furthermore, I don't care to watch Angela Jolie nor Robert Diniro as secondarys."
5,An exceptional movie,"I honestly do not understand why so many people have given this excellent movie such mediocre reviews. I can only imagine that in this dumbed-down age of limited attention spans, anything that challenges the intellect is regarded as 'uncool'. Some reviewers say that the characters are under-developed, while others say that De Niro has taken on too much. This is utter nonsense. The movie is superb, the casting is superb, the acting is superb, and the story is superb. It is, in other words, a masterpiece."
4,"An intelligent, entertaining film.","The Good Shepherd has a quiet intelligence about it, making subtle and interesting points about the human condition -- about trust, sexuality, intimacy, and rationalization. To be sure, it has it's flaws. It's a bit on the long side -- it could lose half an hour and be a better film for it. Although Matt Damon's performance is unusually understated and his character only marginally sympathetic, it's a riveting turn nonetheless. He's one of those smart, quiet ""clerks"" whose emotions lie buried and whose ruthless intelligence makes him capable of just about everything except meaningful human relationships."
4,Generally good despite a few flaws,"This is, in general, a film that kept me riveted to my seat. Performances good except for Angelina Jolie, who shouts rather than acts during parts of the film. Billy Crudup could have used additional coaching with his English accent. It required more than one viewing for me to unravel a plot that went back and forth between present and past, but it made sense after a couple of viewings. Matt Damon is excellent as is the rest of the cast. No one should take this for history, but it does provide what seems to be some insight into the mentality of CIA and its Soviet counterpart, KGB during the Cold War. One of the most interesting episodes is what happens to a KGB agent who is mistakenly believed to be a plant trying to discredit a true KGB defector. The movie has a feeling of reality though it is a fictionalized version of certain characters, periods and events in the history of CIA. Intelligently written. Robert DeNiro has done a stellar job as director."
2,This could have been good,"This film is not complicated or cerebral as some have commented. It tries to be that but these attributes should not be confused with a thin plot supported by a sound track that seems to be in every scene making noises for no reason, disjoined scenes, dark sets and minimal dialogue. It could have been good if the plot and characters were fleshed out. I've watched it three times and the film becomes thinner and the backing track even more pervasive and annoying. A chance was missed with this one.This film is often compared with the Constant Gardener (that did have a plot which needed following). But leaving people confused is not deep film making. All I got out of it was that the central character was a cold blooded, upper class and uncompassionate CIA operative, with little love for himself or his family - so what?"
3,GOOD SHEPARD HD DVD,Delivery was quick and prompt but for those who have a HD DVD will need to upgrade DVD player to play HD portion of DVD. It will only play standard version.
2,"Out of sedatives, watch The Good Shepherd.","I respect Robert De Niro and Matt Damon, but have they conceived what ingredients should be incorporated into a movie to make it the least bit watchable? By min. 20 I thought I was at least 90 min. into the movie. The only words in my diction I care to employ to describe this movie are tedious, sleep-inducing, ineffective, irritating, and interminably long. Hopefully De Niro and Damon will make more approachable movies from now on."
3,"Good, if dry movie -- but is there a commentary track or features?","This was an engrossing, if dry, film for those who like Le Carre novels and the Alec Guiness-starred movies based on them. But it's not clear from either the product description or the reviews if a) there's any director or actor commentaries on the film; b) any making-of featurettes; or c) any documenatries about the real CIA or historical figures, such as James Angleton, upon whom the movie is based.Since there's no mention of any of that in the product description, I assume there's no commentary track or other features. Is that correct?"
4,"Counter-Intelligence, maybe a contradiction in terms","Fans of ""Breach"" should definitely see this fascinating view of an agents life. Mostly focused in the 1960s and some more current proceedings that influenced our foreign policy and the very fiber of our intelligence network. Matt Damon plays ""Mother"" deftly, he is known as a cold calculating agent by his counterparts. We see his lifestyle take it's toll on his family, and the true conviction of many CIA agents. If you enjoy the dryer spy movies that tell more fact than fiction without lots of gadgets, you will probably enjoy this movie. Good quality DVD with a few extras and decent replayability."
2,Snore!,"Again this is a really bad surprise. This is another example of how you take an exceptional cast and manage to botch up a movie. When I saw the trailer in December 2006 I was looking forward to seeing thi movie about the birth of the CIA. Unfortunately it is way too slow-moving and somehow not that interesting in parts. Matt Damon is good in the role of a future spy-master who is recruited after studying at Yale. He then manages to meet and marry the sister of one of his upper-class friends. How he then manages to become such a grey and rather uninterseting character afterwards is more a problem of the script and probably of the directing. Indeed, while the start is confusing, the rest is worse because it actually manages to get uninteresting. As I write, to have such a splendid cast and to manage to ahve them act well in what could be an interesting movie and make it become such a bore is quite an undertaking. Snore."
1,This movie is a joke...,"I saw it in the theater and man this movie sucks! This is the only movie that literally fell asleep to. Don't let these actors get money for garbage like this! It's a bunch of talking and very little action. Waste of damn three hours of my life. It is so damn pointless. Instead, watch a real movie like Departed(has Matt Damon as well), the Shooter, Perfect Stranger. They are all much more entertaining than this trash!"
3,I guess I expected More !!,This movie is slow ... I knew I should have waited for DVD .. but Deniro ( CIA ) I ran to this show like a Bennie Hill to a Buxom Blonde ... oh well ... I am sure watching this at a HOME Theater will be much much better... but dont miss it ..come on..
3,Faith in GOD.,A very interesting account of how business was conducted by CIA. And a not so interesting account of how the Bay of Pig's operation was compromised. The film would have been more realistic if the writers would have suggested that Rachell Welch was performing at a strip club and all the support that was required for the Bay of Pig's to be successful was at the show; I would have givin more stars for that scenario!
2,"Billed as thriller, but really wasn't","The story occurs in a series of flash-forwards and flash-backs moving play by play like a chess game over many years. If you miss a caption, you're struggling to figure out just where and when you are. The film's an interesting bit of history, but hardly worth the thriller designation. For the most part, it just ground on."
4,Good drama/thriller,"This is a movie that you must pay close attention to at all times or you may get lost in the twists and turns. It's a good thriller with a complicated plot and worth the rewinds if you do have to watch again to digest everything between and during the flashbacks. Matt Damon takes on a secretive career within the CIA where people can easily 'disappear' and are often distanced from their family. When one of his operations endangers his only son, Edward Wilson (Damon) must suddenly make tough choices regarding loyalties.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,"I enjoyed this movie, would recommend watching","I enjoyed this movie, although it is very long. Fascinating storyline thatgrabs your attention and maintains your interest throughout the movie. Stellar performance by Matt Damon. I highly recommend this film.Seven Secrets to a Successful Divorce"
1,It might be a good shepherd but i's a bad movie without any entertaining value at all.,"The film is long, heavy and boring. For almost three hours, all the characters did was talking,talking and talking again. From what I know, movie came from the word ""move"". So, if all the actors andand actresses just moved their lips the whole time, it should be called a ""play"" not a movie!To understand the tension, and hardship of a spy, it's better to read a non-fiction book written by a realspy such as ""Spy Catcher"" by Peter Wright. A book can describe pyschological and non-material mattersdeeper than a movie."
1,LOCAL BOY MAKES BAD,"No, no, anything but this! Just exactly how much money Larry King was paid to review this stinker hghly is unknown. What should be known is that DeNiro laid an egg here, a really rotten one. Local hero Matt Damon pays the ultiimate price-totally miscast as the CIA rising star,who's ascent adversely affects his demeanor,marriage and family.How many trillion men in history could say/have said the same thing? The entire ""production"" is entirely too long, tedious,boring. And, again, it's becoming obvious to this reviewer that if Damon is playing a role that seems to be a part of himself-see ""Rounders"", ""Good Will Hunting"", the ""Bourne"" series etc,-then he's very good. Otherwise, he's typically as useful as Wally Cox would have been playing ""Patton""! One positive point: the movie IS marginally better than ""Ski Party""."
1,Downloaded movies won't work for the hearing impaired,"I can't review the movie because I couldn't hear it--the Unbox downloads don't include closed captions or subtitles, so if you're hearing impaired Unbox isn't for you! The service certainly works as advertised, but it's still faster for me to drive to the store for a rental (and cheaper too, since we have RedBox kiosks all over the place)."
5,your one star u r,The multi taskers who watched this movie in traffic on the the road!Gave it two stars and thought 2 long. Everything is (thankyou) Not a blip on my phone or mtv movie. Good plots and dialogs move at the speed of of plot and character development. Take a time out chill. The movies a thrill!
2,Flat,"""Flat"".The Good Shepard rolls along like a flat tire,blown out under its own weight.The key points are predictable, the performances placid,and the running time (about three hours), a marathon.If you have the patience, and the stamina... it is wortha look, but I'd wait for HBO."
3,A 3 Hour Soap Opera.,"Put no doze in your popcorn. The acting is great but continuous shifting from 1945 to 1961 broke the continuity of the film. If you can stay awake you'll find this movie to be an interesting but narrow historical perspective of the CIA, it's racist origin, function, outlook and legacy. Robert DeNiro used a laid back method of telling this tale directorally."
2,Sleep-Inducing,"I have three things to say about this film:1. The pace was so incredibly slow that the film was rendered unenjoyable. I get that it was intended to be serious, but it was serious to the point of stagnation. It was serious like a graduate school lecture is serious, but not particularly enjoyable.2. The lighting was too dark. Again, I get that it is supposed to be a film with a dark, grave subject matter, but I would also imagine that the audience is supposed to be able to actually see the film. I found myself squinting and wishing that someone would turn on the lights.3. The characters left me cold. I was unable to care about any of them, even Angelina Jolie, and I usually like Angelina Jolie. I just found myself wishing that the film would end. It had a high ""so what"" factor. This was compounded by the long length and overly complicated plot.I really liked Robert De Niro's previous directorial effort, ""A Bronx Tale."" Delightful film. What happened?"
3,Surprising lack of characterization for such a long film,"Writer Eric Roth said he originally wrote this film for Francis Ford Copolla about 12 years ago, and the Godfather comparisons weren't lost on a lot of critics either. However, I don't feel as if we ever really get into the mind of the main character played by Matt Damon. One could argue that's the very essence of his character--he's so guarded that he is truly unknowable--but who wants to watch a 3hr movie about a guy like that? That being said, this semi-ficionalization of the Cold War CIA does have its interesting moments and sparked my interest in finding out more about this era in American history."
2,Nah,Granted there are great actors in this movie they just couldn't pull it off. Movie was too long and the script wasn't that good. Had a very Syriana feel to it...DRY.
3,Boring!,"Matt Damon basically played a character who had one facial expression the entire movie.It was a 3 hour movie that felt like a 4 hour movie, but shoud have been a 2 hour movie."
2,didn't care for it,"After watching BLOOD DIAMOND, this was really a ""sleeper"" for me. Maybe its a typical ""guy movie"" but all I know is, I kept falling asleep. I would never watch it again, nor buy it. How it got those great ratings, I'll never know. I loved this guy in the BOURNE movies, because they had action. It also threw me with all the accents and names, and the low tone of their voices making it hard to hear. I think his life had to be hell to live like that, but then he seemed to really enjoyed it."
2,The Good Shepard,"Difficult to follow timeline, makes the plot seem erractic. The twist was a little weird. Lack of dialog was a disappointment, and didn't make use of the cast of good actors."
1,Most boring spy movie ever made,"Incredibly dull and uninteresting given the subject matter. Why on earth would you do a fictionalized account of the development of the CIA when the real story is well known and then make this plodding, vague mismash. Matt Damon's worst performance by far -- he manages to have zero chemistry with Angelina Jolie. Not even entertainingly bad -- just bad."
1,Boring; long; complex.,"There's an interesting and important story somewhere out there but this is not it. I haven't seen such stilted acting in a long time and a more convoluted story than this one. Now, I can do complex movies, such as Syriana, but this one takes the cake."
4,Very engaging...,"I am surprised at the variation in reviews. I thought this a terrific movie, and Matt Damon as a very human and conflicted character. Angelina Jolie was totally miscast, and this made the movie frustrating every time she came on screen. Naomi Watts would have been a better choice. But for suspense, this is a good movie."
4,Surprising Thriller..Worth the Wait!,"If you can get past the first 20 minutes of this movie without shutting it off, you're in for a treat. The first part of this movie is quiet and boring and at times doesn't seem to make sense. The first time I watched it, I shut it off. The second time I sat down to see it, however, I let it play...after you get through the early history of the character, etc., the movie's sound picks up and so does the action. It all comes together in a powerful thriller...Matt Damon is convincing."
1,Long and boring are compliments!,"I can appreciate long, complicated movies if the character's have personalities, but unfortunately this is three hours of my life that I can't get back. I could see how the movie could have been good, and indeed should have been good. Instead, what we got was a long, disjointed, uninteresting story with even less interesting characters. I was thankful when it was over and was expecting to see some pretty bad reviews on it when I got home. Since there weren't many, I took it upon myself to write one. I'm glad I borrowed it! This was a big miss for the famous cast and director. What a waste of time."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I couldn't find anything in this film remotely entertaining about this film. Sure some facts are meticulous, but as far as ever caring about any of these characters-nada. It's just slightly better than Clooney's Syriana. At least I was able to make heads or tails what was going on in this one. I just still didn't care. Pass this one by if you can."
1,bad movie,"there arent that many 3 hour movies about introverted passive unsympathetic guys. I wonder why?Robert De Niro is a great actor, but I cant say I was impressed by his direction. Aesthetically the film is inconsistant and weak. but the real disappointment is that the performances of the all star cast are sub par.I should have walked out of this one after a few minutes. It doesnt get better."
1,Bored Shepherd,"GOD!!!!! Please spare me from interesting previews and beyond boring movies. No plot, no action, no sex. Wasting of a great cast. Too bad I can't give it -5 stars. Avoid this movie!!! The pain of a root canal (I've had at least 4) is nothing to the pain of such boredom. I'm embarased for everyone who produced this movie."
2,a let down....,"Fascinating historically, but tedious as far as entertainment goes. I gave it only 2 stars because it had so much wasted potential. With all the wonderful talent and initial intrigue, you wonder why halfway through the movie you wish it would end."
1,C.I.A. Confused I Am,"The Good Shephard was one of those movies I had no desire to see in theaters so I rented it with a friend instead. I love movies that involve your complete attention and have to be watched more than once to catch everything- but this movie was terrible. It jumped around way too much and left little explanations for any actions that were performed. Unless you knew exactly what was going on during which year, and I'm assuming most people don't, then you become confused and aggravated trying desperatly to figure out what they are talking about. My friend was even more aggravated than I was.I don't recommend the movie if you are looking to be educated on the birth of the CIA.Also, there is violence and sexuality in this movie so it may not be appropriate for kids."
2,Waaaaaay Toooooooo Loooooooong,"Potential viewer be warned. This is a confusing, dull, pointless, badly cast(Jolie) film. But the worst sin is that the filmmakers had the conceit to stretch this thing out to 2 hours and 48 minutes! Good production values are the only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 stars."
1,Boredom,"One of the most boring, uneventful, and dull movies I have ever watched. A total waste of time."
1,"Please DeNiro, give us a break","In case anyone is misinformed, Robert DeNiro is just an anti-American hippie. This so-called tale, or maybe tale is a better description than story, is so far out of touch with history that it is pathetic. Yes, sometimes the CIA can be pretty pathetic, too, but at least their pathos is not contrived, it just happens, humans being human, after all. DeNiro's pathetic film is totally contrived and seems to be directed at making the USA's spy mission somehow evil. What were we (the US) to do during the Second World War and the following Cold War? Close our eyes and pretend that the Soviets and Papa Joe Stalin were a bunch of nice guys not trying to get us. They certainly were trying to get us and if sometimes our spy agencies screwed up, well, as I said above, they were human; and if anyone thinks the Soviets didn't screw up, they need to read up on their history.All in all a pathetic picture, made more pathetic by poor editing and historically inaccurate tale-telling."
1,Boring,"I love all the actors in this movie, but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I couldn't wait to turn it off. Huge disapointment."
2,Try wearing slip-ons next time....,Does it get any better than Michael Gambon's off-screen scream? Python couldn't have done it better.These spies: not a patch on George Smiley.Cliched.
1,the good shepherd,"there is a known problem with the DVD COMBO .,does not play the HDDVDon the toshiba hd-xa2kn dvd player...."
1,Does not play on the Xbox 360 HD player,"I'd love to rate this high because it looked fascinating from the reviews, but I can't watch it - it will not play in the Xbox HD player which I use. The player cannot recognize the disc. I'd blame the player except the other 20+ HD movies I've watched on it work just fine. Poor quality disc production I guess. Anyway, if you've got an Xbox player, perhaps wait until the release a new version of this disc."
1,The Dry Shepherd,"Skull and Bones, the birth of the CIA, intrigue, espionage, sex, murder, and more are all in The Good Shepherd yet the 3 hour film lags like a lady with an expired coupon at a grocery store. The film is as dry as can be. My brother and I actually stopped on the way home after the film just to get something to quench our parched mouths. Everyone save you money on this one. The theater was packed and I feel everyone was disappointed. I am not sure who edited this but it easily could have been the same bad film with only 2 hours of footage. I am amazed that such fascinating subject matter could be made so boring. That sucky phony lame film National Treasure was better and I hate that film."
5,Tasty alternative to bread or bagels,"I was looking for an alternative to bagels and came acrossLundberg Eco-Farmed Brown Rice Cake, Salt Free, 8.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)and, based upon the reviews, decided the product was worth a try.The product was so nicely packaged, doubled wrapped for freshness and in a carton with each unit separated by cardboard to keep crumbling at a minimum. I really wasn't expecting much since I had tried plain rice cakes before but never developed any enthusiasm for them. However, this brown rice cake was such a nice surprise that I have added the product to my subscribe and save favorites.I chose the salt free because the toppings I choose usually provide more than enough salt already. Depending on whether I am in the mood for spicy or sweet, I enjoy these rice cakes with hummus or peanut butter, etc. The cakes are so light and easy to digest and seem to go well with all sorts of toppings."
3,Rice Crackers on Amazon,"Im trying to cut back on bread and rice cakes is the solution for us. Buying by the case is certainly a cost saver, the taste is fine but it is so crumbly that I loose a third before I can eat it. I toast mine--always, otherwise it taste like paper."
2,"Dry and Edible; they fall apart in your hand, not in your mouth","I ordered these in an attempt to have healthier snacks. I usually enjoyed the taste and texture of rice cakes. Maybe this is just what brown rice cakes are like versus the white I'd previously known, but these were the driest rice cakes I'd ever known. Most of the rice cakes fell apart somewhat at the slightest touch, and as I finally eat the last bag after four months with them, I have a spare bag of the crumbs which is almost entirely full.On the plus side, they are rather shelf stable. The first bite months ago was as good as the last one."
3,Rice cakes,"This brand of rice cakes tend to fall apart when removed from the bag, the crumbs do make good ceral tho. They are organic and whol grain brown rice, healthy."
4,Will they be crumbled?,"I buy these for my dogs to help in controlling their weight and they are salt free. However, I like them with peanut butter. My only complaint is that I never know if they are going to arrive so that few are broken in bits. This last order seems to be much better than the last."
2,Crumble Cakes!!!,"I would not recommend anyone to purchase these cakes. They crumble really, really bad. I had to use them as cereal they were so bad. Will not purchase again."
5,Only One of its Kind!,"This is an excellent and easy to understand text. It enables the reader to make a multitude of settings in wax for jewelry. Easily solves that odd-shaped-stone problem for just about any jewelry item, be it a ring pendant or brooch.A bit pricey for the number of pages (33), but as I say in the title: There isn't another one like it!"
2,This is NOT the Jose Jose I know!!!,"Unfortunately, this Jose Jose CD is both very disappointing and incredibly ill-conceived. For starters, the ranchera songs are totally inappropriate for him. Secondly, most of these songs are definitely and unquestionably inferior to anything he recorded previously. With the exceptions of the smooth pop-baladas ""Ya Lo Sabia"" and ""Necesito Un Amor"" this CD has nothing to recommend it. Jose Jose really needs to work again with the likes of Roberto Livi, Rafael Perez Botija or Manuel Alejandro."
2,He can still do a lot better!,"I own every single CD ever recorded by José José therefore I have the audacity to believe that I'm quite familiar with his voice, his talent and his style. No, his voice is not quite as strong as it was, let's say, twenty years ago. But, I saw him in concert about a year ago and he showed that he still has enough voice to be able to record a much better album than this. With the exception of one song, this was a waste of his time and ours- his fans. He needs to get back together with a composer like Roberto Livi or Manuel Alejandro who fully understands José's talent and magic! Nonetheless, he is still, and will always be, El Príncipe!"
4,Live at Pomepii- just as I'd remembered it.,"I saw PF: LaP almost 40 years ago, and not since, and I wanted to see it again.Well, here it is. The transfer is very good; I couldn't detect any artifacts (or, forthat matter, anything that would tell me this was *film* that was close to a halfa century old). The colors were still solid and crisp, no scratches, no dustmarks (that I noticed, at least).If you're a PF fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a PF fan, then youshould start with their better known works (like Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall)and work *backward* in time from there. Then, when you start hearing about SydBarrett, you are ready for this movie.- Bill"
4,This is a First Communion Set,"As a First Communion gift set, this is beautiful. It consists of a hardcover-bound Children's Missal and matching Rosary with gift card in a lovely presentation box.I wish I'd known that when I ordered. There is nothing in Amazon's description to say this is what you're getting. I thought I was getting a set of Missals (Sunday and Weekday). I'm returning my set as it did not meet my expectations."
3,Great catchy tunes but who did the mastering???,"As an electronica/dance music aficionado, this disc is great. For those into the music...5 stars. This review isn't about that.I bought this disc basically mainly for the extended remix of ""Show Me Love"". The regular version and the rest of the disc sounds okay, except for the usual brick wall level slamming, but then again almost all commercially available discs of this genre are like that. However the extended version just plain sounds horrible. Fuzzy, spitty and distorted sound.Whoever did the mixing and/or mastering on that track probably either did it on really cheap gear or should have their hearing seriously examined. Trust me, this is being played through a megabuck CD/DAC system. Maybe there's a different version, I'm looking; but if it is in the mix, then it's pointless as they'll all be the same. This is a NOS 1993 Atlantic recording, catalog # 782509-2. For that...1 star. Disappointing.So overall a 3, I guess."
3,DECENT !!!,"A good debut from Robin S. What ruins this cd are the very overproduced generic [although lovely vocals]R&B/ Soul ballards . The singles are the standout tracks . DEFINATELY purcase her second 1997 CD "" From Now On"" first ! SIGNED MUSIC FAN."
4,Hitting Their Stride,"Winter 1988 issue of Forced Exposure featured Big Black's final tour diary, interviews with Chain Gang, Robyn Hitchcock, and Raymond Pettibon. An excerpt from the autobiographical novel Your U.S.A. and My Face by Eugene Chadbourne. Short fiction by Richard Meltzer and Nick Tosches. And a never-before-published May '81 letter from Philip K. Dick to his editor detailing his plans for his next book, The Owl in Daylight.Oh, and Billy Dwight's father and son porn review column."
2,What did Howard Benson do?,"I'm sorry, but I fear this new release by P.O.D. is not all them in the editing room. The album isn't nearly as intense or as memorable as The Fundamental Elements Of Southtown or Brown. I'm worried Howard Benson got his hands on the boys right when they were hitting it big, and turned their style completely around. Not that I'm saying Benson is a preying mantis waiting for the next group to take under his wing when they make it big, far from it. But I'm sorry, this is NOT the classic P.O.D. sound we've all come to luv and respect.I mean, could anyone have ever imagined songs like Alive, Youth Of The Nation, Satellite, Anything Right, Ghetto, and Thinking About Forever on any previous P.O.D. release?Although the lyrics are very evangelical, I'm afraid the musical element of this album has taken a blow for the worse. Hopefully the boys (with or without Benson) will be able to regain their touch for their next release."
4,Impressive follow up to Southtown,"I had been looking forward to hear the full album after getting a sample live in concert . It's another huge step forward for Sonny, Traa, Marcos and Wuv . The band impresses me more and more with each album that they release . ""Alive"" is an inspirational song to myself . It tells me that when in my darkest hours there is a shining light showing me the way . ""Youth of the Nation"" is a very touching song . I purchased this cd on the day of World Trade Center attacks . The song starts off with the lyrics ""Last day of the rest of my life/I wish I would've known ."" Possibly my favorite song on the new disc is ""Thinking about forever"" . In it Sonny recalls memories of his mother and the lessons she taught him . The album is musicly diverse . It contains genres from raprock to punk to reggae . A must have for any music lover ."
4,"pretty good , catchy sound and lyrics are ok..","not too bad . i remember this band from the start . i was a teenager and ive liked them from the start . their sound changed but it happens .. o well . i really respected them for putting out ''youth of a nation'' , if your mainstream the least you can do is give something back to the massess .... now i give these guys so much credit cause like the reviews here have shown , you have a few different kinds of people .. religious nuts who are freaking out cause there are rasta refrences . the rockers who hate rap and rock being put together and your teenager who is listening to some metal band then freaking out cuase its kool to bash bands like this ... me , not a scene kiddy and not a kid at all (22) ... so yeh , check out the cd for yourself . i think its nice for its easy listening .."
5,A Milestone CD!!,"I have to admit, when I first saw/heard of POD was on MTV for the video ""Rock The Party"" and I was like ""Oh no, not this crap again"" but Satellite has turned me into a dedicated fan. This is one of those rare discs that can't and won't leave the player. Yes it's that good!! Exploding with ""Set It off"", the disc is for real, sliding into ""Alive"" which is one of the best songs I've ever heard IN MY LIFE. ""Youth of a Nation"" is chilling and touches a deep part of your soul with awesome lyrics and guitar tones; ""Thinking Bout Forever"" is just simply incredible. And to think this is all wrapped up with a positive message makes you feel good about being addicted to it!! I could do without the rapping on ""Ridiculous"" but it's a small price to pay for the rest of the disc."
3,Not a Bad Album !!!,"This album is worth getting,I think this group has more talent than Limp Bizkit.There's about 4 to 5 good tracks on this album 2 being ""Youth of the nation & Alive"".In case nobody know's P.O.D. is from San Diego California.Buy this album now."
2,it was alright,its not that great. there are only a few songs on here that i thought were worth listening to. i wouldnt recommend it.
1,Music for the masses,"This was their Album made so that you would buy it. You are a 13 year old girl with money. This album was pure marketing and just to get P.O.D.'s name out to the public.Skip this album and buy all of the other ones because this just does not represent P.O.D. as a band. They decided to sell out on this album, which is fine, they'll be back to the real P.O.D. on the next album. (and I bet you probably will not like the next album either, but I'll love it)"
4,Powerful stuff!!!,"I bought this on the strength of their last album ""Southtown"" which I thaught was good but this is BETTER!!. It has more continuity than the last album which i felt peaked in places (Rock the Party, Southtown)but dipped in others. This has a more consistent feel to it. In a genre that is already looking a bit tired - lyrically most other acts wander in an aimless existence spouting their meaningless drivel - P.O.D. have a positive & poweful message & reinforce it with plenty of originality musically - what more can you ask for in an album ?"
3,A lot different.........,"I bought the CD having heard ""set it off"" and ""the messanjah"". It was a lot different from their previous album, but I didn't mind much. It wasn't until I heard the whole CD that I realized how much softer they have gotten! Personally, I liked their previous ""Fundamental Elements of Southtown"". They obviously experimented more with this album, maybe trying to appeal to a wider audience, but near the end, it gets kind of strange.Don't get me wrong, it was good, but very different as I am a POD fan!"
2,Like any other rock band,"Maybe it's just coincidence, but in two major-label recordings produced by Howard Benson P.O.D. has lost its unique musical identity. On Satellite, multi-tracked guitars and vocals plus keyboard treatments suffocate, leaving no room for the band to breathe musically and trapping passionate lyrical material inside passionless, homogenized musical packaging. At their best P.O.D. is a plug-and-play band that incorporates rap, hard-core, funk and reggae into a fresh,interesting and moving sound (see P.O.D.'s ""Brown""). However, working with Benson seems to have swallowed that promise and fated them in the worst of ways: they sound like any other hard rock band."
3,Hmmm,"This album was kind of stupid but it's easy on the ears. In other words it wont piss you off whether or not you really like the band. All in all it's nothing that great, but it's not bad either. I can't reccomend it."
3,Standard,"Nothing special, nothing below average. Hhhmmm... if I were youI would buy ""The Fundemental Elements of Southtown"", while it is not magnificent, it is still an above average album with two 5 star songs, instead of one 4 1/2 star song. This album is only worth the price of ""Alive"" is worth and then decide if 14$ is worth it, decide what you think listening to that song anytime you want. There are about three standard songs to back up ""Alive"", the rest are throw aways. Buy this if you want, don't expect all the songs to shine like ""Alive"". Don't get me wrong, ""Alive"" is a great song, don't expect the music in the other songs to be as good as thier message."
4,Good Heavy Rock,"I used to think that there wasn't such a thing as good heavy christian rock. I really like this CD. If you are looking for a good heavy christian rock CD, this is a really good choice.""I used to be a Bible-believing christian so there you"" I don't know what's going on in your life, but I will pray that you will change your mind about God.Keith Whitener, if you don't like heavy rock, then turn off the radio when P.O.D. comes on, they are a good band. That goes for anybody who doesn't like loud, heavy, christian rock."
5,"best rock, nu metal or whatever album of 2001","just amazing, but even better if you get the special edition with dvd,almost every song is amazing, rocking, reaggin', going crazy, hip hoping, .... lots of popular songs as alive, youth of the nation, satellite or boom, the rest is even better...sa sa sa satelite!"
5,"Christian band is always the excuse, huh?","First off, drop the Christian label. Yes, they believe in the God and the Christian faith but that doesn't make them a Christian band? They've been trying to drop that label for some time. I know this because My friend of mine lives with Sonny's cousin. I also have multiple friends who works for his uncle. I've also had a few drinks (yes alcohol) with Wuv and seen him get kicked out of a bar for misconduct. These guys are everyday guys that just happen to follow the Christian faith. It's unfair to throw labels at them. A couple members from the band Sprung Monkey attends the same church as POD but does that make Sprung Monkey a Christian band? Next time KNOW what your talking about before you speak."
4,New Wave... Surprising,"I have the last POD CD, Fundamental Elements of Southtown. That album had Very good songs, and bad songs. This CD, is excellent. They have new styles of music in every song, Mixing Hip hop and Hard Rock. Set it off, Alive, and Youth of The Nation, of course are their best songs. Although, towards the last part of the CD, their songs began to get weak, and abstract, not something i would expect from them. I definitely recommend this CD to any POD Cd owner and those who like Hip hop or Hard Rock in general"
4,Preserve wildlife. Pickle a squirrel,"Pretty good album all around. If you're a fan of bands like linkin park, staind, godsmack, creed, and papa roach you won't be disappointed. If you know what kind of music that is then I need not explain more. If not buy it anyway, it's good stuff."
4,Great album,"First of all I'd just like to say that this is a great album. It's got great hooks and decent lyrics. Now that I have that out of the way I would like to plead to anyone who reads this to not label them as a ""Christian"" rock band. I think people that listen to only ""Christian"" rock are definitely missing out on some great music. Just because an artist's cd isn't sold at Marathona doesn't mean it's the work of satan. P.O.D. should not be labled as rapcore, or Christian just as Tool should not be labled as Satanic. Listen to the music and interpret it how you want to. If you went out and bought a Tool cd, don't worry you won't be corrupted by Maynard's beliefs of peace, you would undoubtably find beauty and some of the best music ever recorded. Don't buy a cd because it's a ""Christian"" band, buy it because of the great music it contains."
4,My 5 year old loves it,This is a great album. It has 3 great songs and the rest are very good. We listen to it over and over and over...
5,They rule,"I realy love the song ""Youth of the Nation"" it sounds it's talking about teen kids shooting up schools. Boom sounds like a bome hit the ground. One song sounds like its latin."
1,The Stryper of this generation are pathetic,"P.O.D. to me are a poor man's version of Stryper. Their songs are all the same old tirade of ""Sing your praise to the Lord"" with a Limp Bizkit feel. They say ""Youth of the Nation"" is better than ""Another Brick in the Wall"" they must be on some kind of Pavlovian dog trip cos the song is pathetic compared to the Pink Floyd classic. ""Alive"" is just a poor man's Creed tune. Bring back Stryper."
4,Who says Christians don't know how to rock?,"With the band's new hit single ""Alive"", the band is already surging through the charts like nothing. Hopefully more people will love this Christian band for their music."
5,This is the most awesome C.D. ever made.,This is the most awesome cd made by the most awesome band! I would really like to meet them someday if I got the chance to. Every song on this album is good. This cd gets a 10 out of 10 from me.
3,A Familiar Orbit,"I got sucked into this one, pulled in as though by gravitation from the sheer mass of hype: the positive reviews, the ceaseless playing of ""Alive"" on MTV. And for a few shining moments, I was hooked. The opening track, ""Set It Off,"" opens like a aural detonation, an compact explosion of jittering guitar and hiss-and-boom drums that then works through movement after movement of surprise: rap backed by atmospheric guitar tinklings, whispery balladry, and a howling chorus. It's impressive, but after dozens of listens I found myself wanting more of the first track. The remainder of the release ends up being a paint-by-numbers approach to rap-rock. It's all here, every cliche you've heard over the past ten years. It's wrapped up in a very impressive package, mind you. The production and engineering is thick beyond comprehension, so dense yet clear. But the songs lack the necessary density, favoring simplicity instead, giving us a good, but not great, release."
4,another great cd from one of the leading christian bands,"This i a great album. There are only a few tracks i didn't care for like ""Celestial"", and ""Without Jah, Nothin'"" all the other songs are good its definately worth buying if you like bands like linkin park and blindside. If you have never heard of blindside check them out as well. Their cd silence is the best"
4,Really great album!,"This album rules! The only song that I really don't much like is ""Ghetto."" All the other songs are really awesome! I reccommend this album to anybody that likes hard rock, alternative rock, and even fans of slower kinds of rock too because it has a little bit of it all. About 60% hard rock, 30% alternative rock, and about 10% slow rock."
4,Good stuff,"I'll admit it, I bought this album solely on all the hype that surrounded it. Much to my chagrin, this album has become an instant classic in my book. P.O.D. took their signature sound and mixed it with more melodic sounds this time around, creating yet another splendid album. No wonder the mainstream loves these guys so much.TOP PICKS: ""Youth of the Nation"", ""Alive"", ""Boom"", and ""Set It Off"""
4,Alive is just the beginning,"I bought this CD for two reasons-the message the band sets forth and I loved the lead single. The other tracks follow right along. I'm not usually into the heavier music, but I found this CD didn't really assault my senses as similar music seems to. The songwriting is incredible, and I just love the positive, spiritual message the band relays. These days it's almost impossible to find a rock CD you can listen to with children around."
5,POD are real good,POD are real good artists and this is a real good album. I think it is a real good album and is a must-have.
5,great uplifting music,get this cd because not only is it good but its positive he sings about god and how great life is unlike limp bisquick who sings about the nookie and other stupid stuff that dosn't matter u will love this cd i know u will.
4,Good Music for The Ages,"Even an over 40 old boy like me can appreciate the drive and sentiments behind this music. It gives my kids and I an enjoyable listen together...how uncool huh. Well neither of them are teenagers quite yet.The thing is that in my youth, the generation gap was most noticable in the kinds of music my folks chose from those that I did. Now we can all rock to Jimi, Zep, Clapton, The Beatles, the Stones....and we're adding to the catalog with new recordings from artists such as P.O.D., the Foo Fighters, the Dandy Warhols, Jimmy Eat World or the Ladies. Plus slowly but surely, the kids are grooving to Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Mozart, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky...to name a few of the influences my folks enjoyed exposing me to...The voice of GOD echos in the reverb on this recording. The force light is not under a bushell - their Christianity shines forth from the darkness of the media. The message is the thing. And I'm glad for that too.Peace be with you all"
5,The best album I've ever heard.,"P.O.D puts more passion and emotion to their music than any other band secular or Christian. I'm so glad to see a band stand up for their beliefs and show love to people even like Marylin Manson. If you don't know what Jesus is like, P.O.D is a good example on what a true Christian is like. They don't think they are better than anyone esle, they still love those who are against their beliefs or them, they love God, and care to bring out the most important message out, the Love of Jesus Christ. I love this album also musically. From ""ALIVE"" to ""Boom"" to ""The Messagejah"" to ""RIDICOLOUS"". It's all good. God Bless P.O.D. May God use you in a mighty way. Also, I can't wait to see them at Ozzfest with System of a Down. I'll be praying and supporting ya. Peace."
4,POD's best cd ever,"Heres a list of songs-Set it off-not bad rap,a great lesson-alive-im not saying its bad but the worst song on satellite-Boom-an awsome song about no more racism-youth of the nation-a good story (sung) about a school shooting-celestial-an erie music piece sounding like outer space (no words)-satellite-should have itroduced the cd-ridiculous-a great song with a guest apperance by eekemouse-messenjah-pretty much repeats ""I am the messenjah"" over and over again-Guitarras de amor-just some guitar songs (no words)-Anything right-bad verses good chorus-ghetto- a bunch of soft rock...-Masterpiece conspirasy- the lyrics don't make sense at all-Without jah nothin'- praising jah with backround vocals by H.R.-thinking about forever-more soft rock-Portrait-some rock some rap, good wrap up songSo there you have it, this great work of art by P.O.D."
5,Super P.O.D,"After i heard the elder albums of P.O.D i was sure to say ""Satellite"" is the best, because the sound you here is the best of all the albums they have."
1,I can't believe I used to love this band,"Honestly, its like someone hit me over the head with a dose of reality and a dose of real music and I suddenly woke up from a trance and realized what crap this band is. But then again, I used to be a Bible-believing christian so there you."
3,"I wash to kist my momey goodbuy, think poop for all wisedumb","I thank thas cd isnt not that goodly, but at the seam tame it isnt that bad eether. But i am not empressed, im not. If you are laking for musik like Ushar then dont buy, if you luve Slipknot lake me, dont bye. Simple thas music is for negros or perty peeple. Not thet I hat negros or party peeple. But when a guy with dread lock says he wash to kist his momey goodbuy, and think his poop for all his wisedumb. That isnt soundful know isn it? Thas musik isnt four me, sorry I am. But it isnt. Thank later. Not soundful, no love!"
1,Not worth your money,"This was the worse CD I ever bought. They say it is a mix of rap-metal and so on, but it is all rap. I do not recomed this item to anyone. So don't waster your time listeing to the samples."
1,Corporate rap metal at its finest.,This music is a contributing reason why the state of Rock music is impoverished.
1,not quite right,"i have nothing against POD except one thing. the fact that people/society claim them to be christian rock. if you look at the cover of this album you'll see a symbol in the ""O"". that symbol is the UNHOLY Trinity. meaning that they have a symbol that represents satan. people who feel that this music is completely Christian and critics who think this need to put their priorities in order and truely see what the music is telling you. i'll admit some of the songs sound good (i.e. youth of a nation and alive) but i despise the fact that critics would be putting them in the Christian music catagory. you try the search see what you come up with. *by the way the star is just a formality*"
1,new POD = new POS,Fundementals of Southtown was an excellent CD and you would expect the same from the new POD CD. BUT ITS TERRIBLE! ! ! !. I mean if you like creed or other bad jesus rock bands then go ahead and buy it. But if your a true rock fan don't even bother listening to it!!!!
1,P.O.D. releases another album with their Lies.,"Anyone that beleives that P.O.D. are genuine Christians have been deceived. P.O.D. is a band of Rastafarians singing their Rasta beliefs.They show there true heart with their symbol that is on every album. The triquetra...which they coin as a trinity symbol. Yes it is a trinity symbol for Pagan godesses.""Test Everything"" 1 Thess 5:21 Remember Jesus warned us many would come in his name (Matthew 24:5). Don't continue to believe the lie....read you're Bibles and don't take P.O.D.'s word for it.P.S. also, I am not ignorant about POD's music or the guys themselves... I willfully called myself a Warrior for many years...met the guys on many occasion. God woke me up."
2,Intriguing,"This book takes you on a discovery of a young woman's talent and often you find yourself trying to pre-think what might happen. Although slow in places, the pace is generally good, and I found myself wondering what would happen in a sequel. Much of this book is ground laying, and therefore a sequel would likely be a more compelling story since you already know what the talent is. The story kept me up all night towards the end in an effort to find out what happened! Always a good marker of a good book!"
4,Good Value,This is a good video card for the price. I have two of these running in sli and its kicks but. Granted there are better cards out there but for under $200 u can buy two of these and it will run most games fairly well. I recommend them for any medium priced gaming rig.Geforce 8600GT PCIE256MB VGA 2XDVI Tv Out Dual Oc Version
4,"Wonderful book, but the pages are too thin.","This is probably my son's favorite book! We had an older version of the book from the 60s that, after reading it 1000 times, is falling apart. So I ordered a new one. I don't like how thin the pages are in the new version. But the book is still wonderful!"
5,Cute and fun.,"This was my little sister's favorite book when she was a child (she's 21 now). For Christmas this year, I bought her a new copy (the old one having been lost over the course of 2 or 3 moves) and she was overjoyed by it. Really cute book."
5,Good product....bad packaging,"This item had to be shipped 2 times and both times the package said (Pack of 12). There are only six(6) packs in the box. Amazon needs to check this out and correct this problem.Thanks,J Brown"
2,Disappointing,"Has this rice been dyed? It sure seemed that way - the broth with which I cooked this rice turned black! And the broth was needed (vs water)... the rice actually was far less ""nutty"" or ""mushroom-like flavor"" than Lundberg contends. I also found that the 50 minutes simmering and 10 minutes standing time was insufficient - the rice was still extremely firm... not even ""al dente"". It needed 15-20 minutes more.Conclusion: disappointing and unimpressive."
5,Nissan 240sx reapir manual.,Excellent repair manual. Book has all the info to make nearly all repairs to my car. Just what I needed to get my car back on the road. Many thanks.
4,After The Rain,"I've just finished reading Norma Fox's book, After The Rain and it was thrilling! The book was written as if it were the character's thoughts. Rachel is the main character and her grandpa is hospitalized. Will he live or die? If you would like to read about a fifteen year old girl who is dealing with her grandfather, who loves her dearly,then you should absolutely read After The Rain. This is an excellent book and I recommend it to anybody!"
4,alicia's review,I liked the book but I thought that it was said because of her grandpa getting ill and not listening to any one including the doctor.The story's about a girl named Rachel and how she bonds with her grandpa while he was expected to die in 3 months. She had a hard time getting along with him because he was stubborn and didn't want help from any one.I would recommend this book to 13 year old girls because it has some romans and a lot of girls could connect with the story on how she bonds with her grandpa and how she worries about her first kiss and her boy friend. The most they could connect to is how her grandpa got sick.
4,After the rain comes sunshine,"This is yet another great NFM book. It's about a teenage girl named Rachel who had many difficult situations to deal with. First of all, she had elderly parents and brothers old enough to be her father.(her niece was 3 months younger than her!) Second of all, she had just gotten a new boyfriend, Lewis. Most importantly, her catankerous grandfather was dying. How could she handle these situations?I enjoyed this book. I found pieces of myself in Rachel. I'm an aspiring writer, and 7 months ago I lost a grandmother who was difficult to get along with, but whom I still loved. I wish I had grown closer to her before her death as Rachel did with her grandpa. ""After the Rain"" showed that although life and any kind of loving relationship often bring pain, in the end the experience is worthwhile."
4,Ashley's Review,"I liked this book because it was about family and I love it when my whole family gets together!In this book a girl named Rachel misses her family because they don't live with or near her. The only person that she sees is her grandfather. They aren't that close. Rachel has to go with her mother to the doctors with her grandfather. They find out that her grandfather has a horrible disease. Rachel feels bad and decides to get closer to her grandfather. She does and ends up walking with him every day. After a month or two Rachel's grandfather gets put into the hospital. Rachel skips school just to visit him. After a while in the hospital, he dies.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes a story about pulling your family together and learning about diseases."
5,"If you only buy one guide for the trail, buy this one","A friend and I did the L&C trail last summer. We took this guide and some others. This was *by far* the best guide. We literally would not have been able to find some sites without it. We came to trust its advice so much that we consistently asked each other what ""Julie"" had to say about various parks, campsites, etc. I can't imagine doing the trail without this book."
5,great jam music dude,this is a great jam cd great for deadheads this is what it would of been like to see the pink floyd back in 1966 1967 its a full 28 min of a pure psychedellic freak out i should say plus the video is cool has pink floyd peforming this since this album is live i say buy this and interstellar overdrive great jam man SYD BARRRET R.I.P
1,A Yawn,"What a big disappointment. A bunch of stoned musicians noodling around and making completely inconsequential music. I like the Syd Barrett era, and I expected more from this album. Avoid."
2,Not the complete method!,"This edition is not really what it says. Carcassi's original method was published as Opus 59. There are three parts - the first takes you through the major keys C, G, D, A, E, F and minor keys Am, Em, Dm. The second part starts with slurs and trills, introduces higher positions, and rounds out some of the other keys. Part III, ***which is missing*** are 50 graded etudes. These are NOT the 25 Etudes of Opus 60. The omitted etudes of Opus 59 are very charming and do a lot to prepare you for Opus 60. The Carl Fischer edition (the orange one) has the 50 etudes."
2,Wrong heel height,Heel height is advertised as 3 inches. The cork part is 3 inches but the lining adds another 1/2 inch which was more than I could handle. Wish the description had given actual height of heel. These shoes are beautiful and fit well. I will not wear them.
1,This one is not a winner,"I have to give the company that compiled it a thumbs up for the packaging, anything beyond that gets a 1 out of 5.This item is basically a CD with internet websites on it that you have to spend weeks and months researching it yourself, no real research was ever done on their part other than provide internet sites to the government agencies that provide financial assistance. I recommend this product for people who don?t have access to the internet."
3,Rare Stephen King and other treasures,"Highlights here include ""Free Dirt"" by Charles Beaumont (nice twisted ending), ""Night of the Tiger"" by Stephen King (a story in the tradition of creepy circuses), ""Poor Little Warrior"" by Brian Aldiss (that guy has an incredible use of the language and turning phrases), ""Nina"" by Robert Bloch (I could guess what was coming, yet the ending was still nothing short of mortifying) and ""By the River, Fontainebleu"" by Stephen Gallagher (an artist's perception changes reality, another creepy ending.) The stories by notable authors Richard Matheson and Charles Grant didn't do much for me but others might disagree. Thirteen stories in all and worth buying for horror and dark sci-fi fans."
4,No rest for detectives; Nancy's on another case!,"Nancy's new case takes her to Chicago, where Yvonne Verdi, editor and co - owner of a new teen magazine called Flash, is getting death threats. Yvonne claims that the culprit is Mick Swanson, her partner, and she just wants Nancy to prove it. Nancy isn't so sure until she's the victim of one of Mick's sick practical jokes. Nancy's working under cover, but Mick has branded her as Yvonne's spy, so half the office is giving her the cold shoulder. When Nancy's boyfriend, Ned, comes to help her with her detective work he falls for Mick's sister, Sondra. Now Nancy has two jobs; find out who the poison pen writer is and keep Sondra away from Ned. I loved this Nancy Drew because Ned finally gets a little fed up with tagging along on all of Nancy's cases, and Nancy realises how much she takes Ned for granted."
3,Great book,"Nancy goes to Flash magazine to see who's threatening a woman named Yvonne with freaky letters. One of her main suspects, Mick, seems really dangerous so Nancy calls Ned to be her bodyguard. But it backfires when Ned falls head over heels for Mick's sister Sandra!! This was a really good book."
2,clunker calculator,I have used this model of calculator for the last 5 years in my accounting office and then I tried my friend's Sharp calculator. It was much quieter and ran much more smoothly. Mine rattles when you input numbers. It is so annoying that I am now shopping for a Sharp. Sharp has always made the best desktop calculator so I shouldn't be suprised.
2,Barbie Styling Head,"My child had fun playing with doll head's hair, but overall size was much smaller than expected. For the price, every thing could have been proportionately larger."
5,Love Burt's Bees Products !!,"The Doctor Burt's Res-Q Ointment is wonderful on lips, hands, cuticles and anything else. I always have compliments on the wonderful smell (the lavender really stands out). It has an oil base, yet I love the product."
2,At least it looks good,"I am 5' 11"", 180..it is barely roomy enough. Reclining is a MAJOR deal..my wife hasn't the strength to open or close it, Open by pulling out side lever...very strong spring. Close by pushing HARD with back of your legs. a real pain. The leather appears to be well sewn, of good quality. To top it off, delivery took twice the predicted time. I DO NOT reccommend!! I have now used it for a little over 2 months, and VERY dissappointed. The leather is still nice. Still diffuclt to close..and open. My new complaint is the seat. It is lumpy, uncomforetable and the leather on it is wrinkling. NO way would I buy another,,,at half the price!!"
4,Love me some Niecy Nash!!!,"If you love the Reno 911 television show, then you will surely love this movie! See what happens when Miami needs a new police force, but the Reno crew is all that's available."
2,Great show- dumb movie,the show was awesome the first few seasons but the movie bombed! don't waste your money on this movie- i wouldn't even rent it unless maybe it was netflix lol
3,I really love the show but...,"I love the series Reno 911! and I will admit that this movie has it's moments...just not as many as the TV show. While the movie tends to use adolescent humor, the series is better as it is kinda a satire on ""low rent"" society. The series and the movie are daylight and dark, but the acting from the cast was never an issue. As always, the Reno 911! cast was spot on and in character. It was the plot far removed from the great episodes that we fans have expected. Still, I like having the movie in my collection because it seems like it completes the set."
4,Laugh out loud funny.,"Pure mind candy and escapism. If you want reality, watch COPS. If you want a humorous distraction, watch this."
1,You really have to lower your standards to enjoy this,"this has got to be the most amaturish attempt at movie making that i have seen in a long time. seriously it looked like it was filmed on a hand held camcorder. bad story and horrendous acting make this crapfest seriously hard to sit through. all you get is a bunch of morons wandering around miami, save yourself some pain and watch any of the police academies. i know they weren't the greatest but compared to this deluge of sewage. they look like master pieces."
1,Reno,I went blindly in to this movie. I thought oh this will be a funny stupid kind of comedy that would be fun to see. Boy was I wrong. This movie had no plot. Was gross the whole way through out. I saw everyones [...] and it was not funny. It was gross. Crude humor involving sex. I felt embarrassed that I was watching this. I wanted to leave halfway through but I stayed. Now that I saw this peice of trash I wish I would have just stayed home.
2,Bland,"Transitioning from televison to the big wide screen is complex. It's hard for a televison show not to use the same path when it hits theaters. Well Reno 911 did! As hilarious as the show is, this one gave me a few chuckles but overall, the movie was below average. We've seen it all before on the season episodes, and the screenplay was not interesting, and also a little confusing. The few scenes that made me laugh kept me from ragging on this movie even more. I'm a big Reno 911 fan, and I'm looking forward to the season 4 DVD."
2,Not much better than TV show,It is interesting seeing the group in a different setting than the TV show but aside from a bit more sexy situations there isn't enough here to keep your interest.
5,Good movie.,"The first Reno 911 movie, and I found it entertaining and funny. Not as funny as the episodes on TV but still gave me a few laughs."
3,"Funny stuff at times, otherwise, does get somewhat old","If you are a fan of the TV series, then this is likely going to be great for you, but for the big screen, it was a little small. All they did here was turn up the crudeness, and cut out the bleeps. This movie follows the Reno sherrifs department to a convention in florida for all of the US Sherrifs departments. Suddenly after a bio-attach, they are left as the only police force outside the conference, and have to keep peace in Miami. This does make you laugh intermittantly, so worth a look, but I would rent it first before deciding to purchase."
2,Someone call 911!!! This movie is a Disaster!!!,"I went into this expecting it to be funnier than the TV episodes because of the freedom the big screen would allow the writers. As I watched it, I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but only got a small chuckle here and there. This was a HUGE letdown, and I would not suggest anyone to waste their time on this. Just catch some reruns of the TV show if you want a laugh."
2,Trashy and Stupid,"This was a strange movie with not many funny scenes. They tried a little too hard to make it funny but it just falls flat. In many ways this is a vulgar movie. Showing guys jerking off through their hotel windows is not funny, even though I think they meant it to be. Also what could have been a very funny sequence involving a beached whale seemed to focus a little too much on breasts of a couple of the girls on the nude beach or more correctly the topless beach. There were some semi-porn scenes in the motel. If you want to make a porn movie, make a porn movie. If you want to make a comedy, make a comedy. This appeared to try and mix the two and didn't succeed at either. This could have been so much more. It's mildy entertaining and it has its moments, but mostly it's not worth your time. NOT FOR TEENS and definately not for younger kids."
3,"Parts are very funny, others not so much","The gang from Reno get invited to a law enforcement convention in Miami, but when they get there, no one seems to have their reservations. So instead of staying in the swanky convention center with the other officers from all over the country, they have to stay at a flea bag motel. When they go back the next morning, they find out there has been a bio-terrorism attack and everyone in the center is under quarantine, leaving only the Reno gang to patrol the streets of Miami.Reno 911 the movie is a lot like the tv show in that it's very hit or miss. There are some very funny bits here and some others that are just stupid or pointless. The plot is barely there and is only touched on intermittently until the end of the film. There are excellent cameos from Patton Oswalt, wrestler, The Rock and Paul Rudd. I think this movie is worth watching but you probably won't laugh all the way through."
4,If You Like The Show You Will Like The Movie,"Ive always enjoyed the TV show Reno 911. I don't find it hysterically funny but it does provide some chuckles and is a good time to watch. The movie is the same kind of funny. Amusing, but not roll on the floor funny. The main cast of Reno 911 - Miami is the same as the television show. The do however recast a few of the TV show characters to other parts in the movie. If you watch the TV show you will enjoy the recast's as you will say ""Oh that the guy from the renessaince festival"" or ""thats Dangle's ex-wifes gay new husband."" I had a good time watching this movie and you will too. I recommend!"
3,Maybe It Was Just Too Long ?,"Reno 911 , the series cracked me up, I thought it was hysterical and I have it on DVD. 911 Miami ..... while I liked it, I didn't love it. The plot ( such as it was ) I thought was hard to follow. I think the film could have benifitted maybe by some better editing and perhaps it was too long."
2,Lost in Translation,"My husband and I love Reno 911 the TV series, so when the movie came out, we made sure we were in the theaters opening weekend. I have to say the movie was a big disappointment for us. The same humor was there as in the TV screen, but it just didn't translate onto the big screen. Maybe inserting a plot into Reno 911's random off-the-wall humor slowed it down too much."
2,TV> MOVIE,"I am a fan of Reno 911 and have all the box sets on DVD. I went to movies not expecting much and that's what I got. The show works on TV but not in the movies. Only a few laughs for the whole movie, while the TV show can have you laughing every scene. Kinda lame, I'd avoid."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"As a fan of the tv show, I was looking forward to seeing this. Sadly, the movie is pretty much laugh free. There was no plot to speak of, and the writers seemingly ignored the comic possibilities that were there. My hope is that there will be a sequel, which will be better thought out and written."
1,Direct To DVD Movie,"RENO 911: MIAMI is like a straight to video movie that somehow got theatrical distribution. It's technically crude and devoid of decent writing, relying on giftless improv. Seriously, this is beneath the bar lowered by POLICE ACADEMY and I'm sure is a reason why the series itself recently tanked in syndication. If you want decent cop laughs then buy POLICE SQUAD or SLEDGE HAMMER, both of which predated this junk and are funnier during the FBI warning that begins the disc. Such arrogance to foist this subpar movie on the paying public. Beware."
2,First of all...,"...I love the show. A 30 minute helping of this kind of humor is great....but...IT DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO THE BIG SCREEN!At least it wasn't one very well...There were a few laughs, but like so many movies in this day and age, they were in the trailer...I was VERY disappointed when I saw this movie.I bought it before I had seen it.Big mistake.Big disappointment."
2,chicago blackhawks classic moments,"no glenn hall. no tony esposito. just a bunch of games with very limited history of a GREAT franchise. not on my to own list,even though i have waited months for its release. picture a boston bruins set with no BOBBY ORR games and you have a idea what this set is worth."
3,Great Franchise - Lots of History,Went right to the disc with all the ancient history - the Cup victory over Detroit and the jerseys being hoisted to the rafters of old Chicago Stadium. I miss the old Stadium. What a place to see a hockey game - even during those lean years with Grant Mulvey and Rich Preston. Hawks Rule. Gotta go - Game 6 vs The Nucks is about to start.
1,Complete Junk..Returned it...,"The head popped off and I cut myself the first time I tried to use it. POS. Buy a Remington Code instead. Less money,just as cool to look at and it has Remington quality.KJ"
3,Strange even to the believer,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, then very disappointed after seeing it. I am a believer in the soul's journey and afterlife and I thought that I would learn more and get new a perspective. Instead, I saw some very strange people, giving their personal beliefs which were nothing that I have not heard before on the subject. Some of the people looked strangely out of this world. Why am I not surprised?"
5,Strongly recommend,"This book is one of the best parenting books available. It is one of the few books that actually offers substantive advice about how to deal with certain behaviors. Furthermore, it is the only book that I have read that maintains a positive outlook on ""spirited"" children. The book does not focus on ways to change the child and does not imply that the child has a disability. It simply teaches the parent how to deal to deal with behaviors and feelings of the spirited child. I cannot say enough about how wonderful the book is. I reread parts of it nearly every night."
5,I am not alone !,Borrowed the original edition from a friend & cried as I read the dust cover where it said ... Does your child cry for 45 minutes because you cut his toast into rectangles instead of triangles? I thought I was the only mother who struggled through that battle. Got my own copy about a week later. It has taught me that my son's MORE qualities was something to celebrate instead of something to suffer through. The parent rating test was also very helpful to assist me in understanding myself & my leanings in responding to my son. I look forward to getting back to you in a few years to report how my son has used his uniqueness to his advantage. I'm now ordering her sequel fully expecting to learn more from Kurchinka. Thanks so very much !
4,Spirit! Not the horse... the child!,"I thought this title had lots of good suggestions for dealing with your ""spirited"" (intense, sensitive, active, energetic...) child. A lot of times I found myself saying, ""That's just like (my son)."" The author does a good job of reframing the actions and interactions of a spirited child. The only thing I would improve is perhaps to add a section about what a parent can do to help a child conform just a little. The main focus is on what we as parents can do to make life easier for our children (and thus ourselves as well) and that is well and good but it is also worthwhile to teach our children how to be more flexible, control their emotions and such. I definitely recommend this book to any parent with a challenging child."
5,Excellent resource,"This is one of my favorite books for parents. It is geared toward parents who children who have been labelled hyperactive or attention deficit disordered. The author doesn't like negative labels, and gives parents ways to focus on the positive aspects of their children's temperment. The author clearly understands both temperment and child development.The techniques are sensible, practical, and easy to implement. The writing style is clear and concise. The author uses alot of really good examples that make sense and that most people can relate to. The book is one that I, as a practitioner who works with children and families, consider a vital part of my professional library. I highly reccommend it both parents and people who work with children."
5,The first child rearing book that made sense to me,"I am constantly picking up new parenting books, only to be disappointed by their simplistic solutions and goofy examples. I rarely find my own child in these books.This book is an exception. I felt like Kurcinka was describing my child on every page, and offering emphathetic approachs to dealing with him. It was almost eery how well she described my child.If you have a ""strong willed"" child who is truly a strong, persistant personality, this is a great book for helping you understand him/her, and therefore to help you deal with him/her better."
5,definitely worth reading,"This book really helped me understand my child, and helped me stop feeling like a bad parent. I love that Kurcinka advocates for redefining ""negative"" attributes as something that can be positive, because it helps parents and others view their child more positively and work with them. The most valuable thing I took from this book was in learning about personality differences between parent and child, and how that can effect your relationship. I also like that each chapter ""characteristic"" has a summary which gives the reader specific tips working with a child with that characteristic, so the book is easy to reference later on.If I had any complaint about this book, it would be that it encouraged me to think my daughter's ""issues"" were simply personality differences rather than something more, when she actually has mild autism. Parents should take this book to heart, but still seek additional information and help if they are concerned about their child."
4,An excellent book for loving parents at wits end.,"If you need a new way of looking at your ""problem child"" Try seeing him as uniquely ""spirited."" Great insight into yourself, your problem solving skills, and the example you are passing on."
5,For parents who's child is More...,"If you have a ""More"" child (more emotional, more energetic, more enthusiastic, more easily angered, etc) you know how tough it can be to deal with it. This book is a pretty good guide to get you started and help you guide the child through those emotional currents. It's not easy to parent a spirited child but neither is it easy to BE a spirited child. Kurcinka's book helps provide a lot of guidance."
1,what's wrong with discipline???,"I think this is a crock!!! I have a child who can be defined as ""spirited"" (whoops, I just labeled her), but I want to know what kind of favor I'm doing her by falling over backwards to give her her way? There is no reason that ANY child cannot be taught to behave appropriately. This book suggests that there's nothing I can do to change my child, so I should just change everyone and everything else around her to accommodate her. I think I'll read The Omnipotent CHild, as suggested by other reviewers... Hopefully it'll teach how to help my child live in the real world and accept that it doesn't revolve around her! BTW, We know a family following the principles in this book and their son is an absolute monster!!! He demands what he wants when he wants it, and as a result of his mother making this happen, no one can stand to be around him!"
1,Trendy,"There are some useful ideas in this,if you have the time to sift through the marketing jargon, but it seems more trendy than useful."
2,not happy,The updated cover was advestised. Yet they sent me the older version. In the description it should have stated that it was an older version and I would have shopped somewhere else. I wanted the updated cover for my library.
3,book was interesting,"this book was an interesting read but did not offer the advice i was seeking. However, helpful in identifying child behavior as ""spirited"" rather than stubborn or oppositional"
3,"useful, but annoying","Yes, this is supposedly a ""classic"" guide for parents of spirited/challenging/intense kids. And it does offer some helpful advice. What was most useful was its underlying message of acceptance/celebration of your child. Harried parents can never hear that enough. What was annoying, however, was the author's constant insertion of herself into every last page of the book. ""Then I said this"", ""then I thought that"", ad nauseum. It was pretty distracting. Helpful information, but somewhat painful to read given the author's ""style""."
5,The Best!,"I've found this cowbell to be the best all around cowbell. Light enough to mount on my bass drum but beefy enough for rock, jazz and Latin applications!"
2,Remastered?,"Even though I love the mini-series,I, Claudius, I was extremely disappointed with the video quality. I expected alot better when it said remastered."
5,historical,"I Claudius, is a classic, well acted and great story. If you like history, you will like this, it is a true story"
4,wow and wow,It had been years since I had seen this mini series. It was as powerful and well done as I remembered.
4,"fiction, roman emperors",This wonderful classic television event was a kick to watch then and still is s kick to watch as a dvd library collection at home. The actors do a marvelous job portraying the characters of those turbulent times. Roman History 101 in a very entertaining and memorable format. Definitely a keeper for those wanting to purchase a memorable show.
4,Makeup by Play-Doh,"Truly a must see. Outstanding acting and absorbing dialogue. I also liked the DVD extra content. However, I found the makeup extremely distracting. I can't imagine what they were thinking. On many characters it looks like it was clumsily applied with a trowel. So bad I find it downright distracting at times."
1,Episode 2 is Missing!!!,"The biggest problem with this DVD set is that episode 2 entitled ""Family Affairs"" of the original 13 episode series is missing, not to mention cuts in the remaining 12 episodes. These defects make it totally unacceptable."
5,"I, Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanincus......","So Begins the best PBS/BBC series ever, finally on DVD. I do think they good have spaced it out better, but now it will live forever. This copy is better than the tapes, not only because of it will live forever, but because all existing footage, beginning and ending credits are included. Brian Blessed, Derek Jacobi, Sian Phillips, George Baker, and John Hurt and many other known and unknown names at their best. If you like this, you should also purchase the Six Wives of Henry VIII. Next up: Elizabeth R? (I hope)."
1,If only Amazon had been reliable,"This item appeared on an Amazon Wish List. I ordered it. Days later, someone else ordered it, as the item had not been removed from the wish list. The 2nd person received their copy of this item, despite my having ordered it earlier. Now we are stuck with a person not having what they ordered and oaid for and another person having ordered something that they were not told was not available. Please, just offer your customers the least they expect from your organization. Thank you very much and I do hope that your Xmas runs smoothly and satisfyingly.Nina GossBrooklyn,. NY"
3,Doubts,"I gave this 3 stars for the hell of it. I haven't and won't see it. I, Claudius is a book by Robert Graves, a very good book and I've read it 2 or 3 times. Claudius the God is the sequel. In it Claudius is shown to have been (once emperor) as big a monster as any emperor that ruled. I only read it once (it totally spoiled my memories of the first book which I now hate), then I threw it away. Claudius reveled in blood and murder. One scene I vividly remember is his having soldiers on some kind of stage or platform kill each other and slide around and slip and fall in the blood while doing it. Lovely. Great show. Was that in the movie?"
5,A classic,I remember rushing home to watch the PBS showing of this tour de force presentation of Robert Grave's books. Derek Jacobi was an incredible Claudius. I've long wished to have this in my collection.
5,I Claudius is a Mini-Series for the Ages,"This is a film that students of Ancient History and avid readers of Graves will be viewing for hundreds of years. One can only say about this film what Virgil's Dido said to Aeneas before he departed to establish his people in Italy:In freta dum fluvi current, dum montibus umbrae, lustrabunt convexa polus dum sidera pascet, semper honos, nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt! (As long as the rivers run through the valleys, as long as the clouds pass over the mountains, as long as the stars shine in the heavens, always shall thy name, thy honour and thy glory abide!)."
5,"I, Claudius review","This series is splendid in every way and is a must for all fans of Roman history--the actors are superb from first to last. Based on Robert Graves'novels as it is, it does take liberties with historical fact--no one really thinks Livia, wife of Augustus, murdered half the imperial family including her husband!This does not, of course, diminish the extreme pleasure the series affords."
1,Caveat Emptor Indeed!,"I concur entirely with the review titled CAVEAT EMPTOR. So as not to bore you, I will not repeat said review. However, I will add that for a movie titled ""I, Claudius"", I don't understand how one would leave out Claudius's entire childhood. One only sees him go from infant to grown young man. Very disappointing."
3,Great series marred by poor audio,"As many others have written, this is a great dramatic series. I've nothing to add to the accolades. HOWEVER: I was greatly disappointed by the poor audio quality of this DVD. The sound is quite muffled -- as though you're listening to it through a pillow. Yes, you can make out what's being said -- especially if you turn the volume up. But I expected much more from this DVD series. It's a 5-star series -- content-wise -- but I have to downgrade the rating because of the audio."
3,BBC DVD PAL version available,"Thanks to all the reviewers who've said that this DVD is censored and of poor image and sound quality. I was going to buy it and now will not. I found that there is a BBC DVD version available thorough amazon.co.uk that reviewers say is very high image and sound quality (they have been restored from a master tape), and all episodes are included. There is also a documentary on the never completed epic film about Caligula starring Charles Laughton. I have ordered this one. Of course, you need an all region DVD player to play it.After watching the UK DVD, I can report that it is excellent. What a spectacular transfer. The series is a delight to watch again."
4,One of the Greatest Series of All Time....,"...but I have to give it only four stars because of its stunningly poor transfer to DVD. If you can imagine taping the series off the air with a VHS recorder and then taping the copy to another VHS, that's about the image quality you get. The picture isn't even placed properly. The only way I watch mine is to view it on a computer and make the image so small I can't see the imperfections. It's a lot like the old Video CD, where two hour movies were crammed on two standard CDs.If they did a better job on the transfer, I'd buy the series again. I'm not getting rid of mine because it's the only thing available. I do, however, expect more from my money than a production that looks like a poorly pirated copy.The VHS tapes are much better."
3,5 starts for the product -2 for the Sound & Master,"i was waiting and waiting for this release and when it finally came out...i, too was very VERY disapointed! the video quality i could perhaps overlook...but the sound...it's intolerable! i can't hear a word...it's so muddy and muted. even full blast sound it's unwatchable...PLEASE someone find a better master or spend the $ to fix the sound...i CAN be done and it SHOULD be done...because I, Claudius is an outstanding ground breaking series!!..i saw it as a teen on PBS (oohahh nudity, sex & violence!) and i loved it... my fam was all about watching Masterpiece Theatre...Duchess of Dukestreet, Lily, etc... i got an education in stuff (AND GOOD TV!) early!"
5,History at its Best,"Perhaps its not historically accurate. Perhaps the sets are a little overused and the conspicuous absence of any out-door filming is hard to miss, but this epic is more engrossing than anything C. B. DeMille ever could have hoped to produce.The acting is superb (particularly from Sian Philips and Jacobi) and the dialogue is believable. If this series doesn't interest you in history you aren't paying attention."
5,Bigger and Better than other Roman Epics,"After watching this series for the second time, I was still drawn to watching more than one tape at a time. It seemed that I just couldnt wait to see what happened in the next video. This series has got to be the most professionally produced and acted of all Roman classics. I could not find fault with any of the actors in this series. Derek Jacobi was perfectly type cast as Claudius, as was John Hurt and Brian Blessed. This video series is one that can be watched over and over again, and it seems that you will always discover something you missed in the other viewings. Dont miss seeing this great video series."
1,Great Film/bad transfer/no CC,"Not to repeat what others have said, but to emphasize: if you have any hearing difficulties at all (or if you're not good in sorting out accents) do not order this. If the sound were first-rate, I don't think it would be a problem, but it's not: the audio is boomy and distorted when played at volumes that allow you to hear. My hearing is not that bad, but I gave up after an hour; tried wearing headphones--better, but tiring. Why in heaven's name would anyone release such a marvelous film without closed captioning? It seems to be a problem with a number of British video releases. Do they not have hearing disabled people in the UK? Or do they assume that all Americans have perfect hearing?Too bad. It is a great film."
5,Stands the ages of time,"I watched and thoroughly enjoyed I, Claudius on PBS over 30 years ago & ordered the DVD set with some trepidation, fearing the memory was better than the series. Fear not! The make-up would not stand up to today's standards, but the story line, the acting and the direction were even more appreciated, like fine wine."
4,I Claudius,"A must for anyone interested in antique history. Great scenario and great actors (Jonh Hurt plays an amazing Caligula). Those who loved the ""Rome"" series might be interested to know that ""I Claudius"" picks up exactly where Rome finished, i.e. after the death of Marc Anthony. This is where the comparison ends, though, for ""I Claudius"" is a tele-theatre type of production and has nothing to do with the multi-million ""Rome"" production. For my part, I prefer sober productions when it comes to history. It's less distracting.Josée Lefebvre"
4,excellent drama,"Rome was full of scandals, behind the scene manipulations, poisonings, betrayals,... Also, there were a lot of wonderful moments of victory, love, friendship,... All of this is here, and more. The lost star is for the sound: it could have been much better.All in all, you're in for a treat!!"
4,A slightly weak version...,"I recently bought ""Ring Virus"" and I also own the original Japanese version, ""Ringu,"" and the American version with Naomi Watts. I have also read the novel by Koji Suzuki. While I enjoyed all three movies, I found this to be the weakest entry into the series. My biggest problem with the movie is that I found the acting to be sub par, especially with the lead actress and the girl playing the daughter. However, to its credit, I do like how the plot keeps most of the original storyline from the novel. In the end, I give the film four stars because acting performances weaken the story."
4,AMAZING,"This movie was much like the american remake The Ring but it was better and the dead girl was better acted in this one and made it more scary, it was simply amazing. This is my favorite Ring other than Ringu"
3,One thing for make sure.,"This movie, The ring, has two defferent versions, one is orginal japanse version what most reviewer are mentioned, and the other, korean localized remake-version of original. (of course it cast korean actor/actress and directed by korean.)Those two versions has slitly different story lines. korean version gives whole different reason of a death of girl who made this 'cursed video tape'.after this korean version had release in korea, original one has also released and make hit. and now i can find theatrical trailer of american localized version of the ring, and it seems story lines are retouched by hollywood people. interesting.so before you percahse this DVD make sure it is original or remakes."
2,Confusing... But Interested,"Let me get this straight -- MOST people reviewing this are talking about the Japanese version, which they shouldn't. This is the KOREAN REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION. Oy.Anyway, the Korean remake is slightly confusing -- it's almost as if they expected you to have already watched the original Japanese version.The acting is very stale. Very, very stale. The two main characters are often in conflict with each other, even when they shouldn't be.Their portrayl of Eun-Suh (Sadako, Samara, in other versions) is rather interesting. Rather than hiding her face completely, she is portrayed as a feminine figure. Hmm. Go figure.I'd recommend this to fans of the Japanese version only, unless you're in a good mood and want to try something new."
3,"Pretty dull, only for the die hards","This movie bored the hell out of me. Maybe because I already knew the plot having watched RingU first? Maybe because there were hardly any supernatural moments at all?It plays out like a long and boring detective story rather than a creepy horror film or ghost story. I like the added details that were omitted from the Jap version, but other than that, I wish I would have not wasted time buying this."
2,snore . . .,"This Korean remake of the now classic Japanese horror film Ringu manages to sap out every ounce of scares leaving behind a dry, dull rehash of a familiar storyline as a result. Stick to the Japanese or American versions. The Ring Virus is a slow moving, dialogue heavy, special effectless, unscary movie. There are no scares at all with the exception of the end and even the end is anti-climatic. Nice try, but not very good. See this only if you're a fan of the other films and are curious to see this remake."
5,Better than Ringu!,"Although many think that Ringu is better than the American remake and WAY better than the Korean, I thought that the Ring Virus was better than Ringu! It followed closer to the novel that Koji Suzuki wrote and portrayed the story better!It had more suspense like the wierd eerie song that could be heard in the phone call and when someone died. But not the whole thing was perfect. I personally didn't like the fizzle and choppy scenes when someone died. It wasn't the greatest of special effects. And what was up with the faery like eye that kills????...."
2,"Great Drive, Until it No longer Worked","I was very happy with this drive, until it started to poop out on me after about 1 year. It now pops and spins down every few hours, and continues to spin down/up for about 10 minutes at a time, during which it is inaccessible.Having seen the reviews for lots of these external drives, I wonder if it's just the nature of the product... none seem to be very reliable for very long."
3,a decent party rock album,"I'm sure the other reviewers of this album have fond memories of the band, but this CD is really nothing special. That's not to say it isn't a decent rock album, but it isn't exceptional by any means. It follows the basic sleaze-rock/hair metal formula laid down by bands like L.A. Guns and Faster Pussycat, with lots of bluesy rockers and the occasional ballad. The lyrics are pretty basic, and focus on drinking, partying, and sex. Child's Play may not bring anything new to the genre, but their debut album is still a fun listen. If you like your rock loud, sleazy, and essentially devoid of anything meaningful, then Rat Race is an album worth picking up."
2,Poor quality - looks like a copy of a copy,"sorry but this is not even close to decent quality for a DVD movie. It appears that everything from this company is just ""off-shore"" copying mills quality. This had the best reviews/ only reviews and as Amazon reviews are usually helpful, I feel like I got burned on these movies.I really did not expect the very best ""Blu-Ray"" quality but did expect good DVD quality that would ""upscale"" on one of my newer Blu-Ray players. Just did not make it in quality of picture or sound."
5,My favorite movie!!!,"I saw this when it came out in the cinema and it instantly became my favorite film. The wedding of history and sci-fi is simply stunning. the concept of time travel brought to a contemporary light. Sadly, this film was not promoted well when released and has thus been delegated near cult status. I watch it about every 3-6 months and it never loses it's magic. A REAL winner!!! A+++++."
3,I've seen this time after time,"I first saw this on the big screen in 1979. I was impressed by the re-working of ""the Time Machine"" theme. In this case it is H. G. Welles as the hero of the story as he journeys to then contemporary Los Angeles in order to battle Jack the Ripper (who has used the Time Machine to escape late 1800's London.I love the scene when H.G. goes to MacDonald's.The film suggests right at the very end that it is H. G.'s journey through time that allowed him insights into the future which his novels became famous for (viz. The Shape of Things to Come).This is one of the few times I've seen Malcolm MacDowell as the good guy. Unfortunately, it's another bad guy role for David Warner."
5,"Sci Fi, Thriller, and High romance!","I really enjoyed this one! It is sort of a view from the other side on the book The Time Machine. It is H.G.Wells and his good friends at dinner and one of his surgeon friends high-tails it into his time machine as the ""Bobbies"" arrive on the trail of Jack Ripper. The Machine comes back without the erstwhile friend because an important element was not attached. So, horrified and feeling responsibility for this monster in the ""innocence"" of the future world he packs up and goes forward in time to catch him.Much to his surprise he finds himself in a San Francisco museum in a 1970's exhibit on H.G.Wells! The museum has borrowed some of his furniture and the time machine for the exhibit !That's the premise and he goes from there. MacDowell and Steenbergen are terriffic. SEE IT!"
3,poor recall,"I liked this movie when it first came out. I was 20 years old, and thought it was principled, bright & funny. But, somehow, melodrama from the 1980's just doesn't play well for me anymore: the music is incessant and overused; events bludgeon the audience clumsily; the texture of human moments is run over by weak hollywood plot. In this case, action is done without much invention (just enough to get by ...) this movie just isn't what I remember. It may be better than 99% of this year's crop of movies ... but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's very dated."
1,"OMG, what a BAD movie!","Seriously...and I'm not a ""blockbuster"" only type person. I love indi films, old films, unusual films. This one just sucks. Bad acting, slow moving, dumb plot with lots of ""why don""t they just (fill in the blank?).But don't listen to me...get it, watch it, waste your money, and see for yourself...you're not going to listen to me anyway..."
1,wasted time after wasted time,"Predictable from beginning to end. I wasted my time.by the way this is not a real science fiction.beside that they chose every chance to talk bad about the palestenians (in the news), althogh it is not connected to the film."
1,Awful Film,A childish film. Mediocre acting all around. Predictable from beginning to end. Painful to watch. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.
1,Please spare me . . .,"from such schmaltz; such drivel.It's movies like this one that remind me why science fiction is so vastly over-rated.Worse still, why didn't anyone remember to tell the unsuspecting viewer about the trumped up ""humor""."
4,Timeless Classic,"My wife is a nut about Time travel. A long time ago we saw ""Time After Time"" and we both loved it. Ever since, because we couldn't buy the movie at the time, it became a fond memory. However, the name of the movie was lost. Recently, we came across the movie and immediately ordered it. The acting is great and the plot is unique."
4,Time After Time,I thnk I enjoyed watching the movie this time more than ever. I seemed to appreciate the novel idea more than the other viewings.
3,H.G. Wells meets Jack the Ripper,"That sounds a little corny, but I'll try anything with Malcolm McDowell in it. David Warner as the bad guy seems to be the perfect role for him as an actor. The ""babe"" in this film, well, maybe not a ""babe"", but the ""woman of interest"" here is Mary Steenburgen. I've come to notice that she seems to like films about time travel. You'll remember that she was also the school teacher in the 1800's in ""Back To The Future III"". I still think that ""The Time Machine"" from 1960 is far better than this film, but this one is better than the 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"".This movie is worth renting, but Malcolm McDowall had a better film just a couple years later. He was really cool and creepy in 1982's ""Cat People."" Of course, his best is still ""A Clockwork Orange."""
4,ALTERED FROM THE ORIGINAL-WHY?,"The dvd I just purchased (2011) was altered from the original I saw years ago, but still enjoyable. One of the most entertaining parts of this movie was changed for the dvd- I wonder why? In the original, when H.G. was traveling through time, the vantage point from his chair changed showing lady's fashions in a store window (Macy's?) changing as he went through the decades. Also it showed what happened to his home over the decades (it was torn down), That part of the movie was quite entertaining and a lot more interesting than the flashing lights and special effects and no views on the current version."
3,Bland. Not bad but far from 5 star,I would appreciate more creative cinematography. That is my first gripe. The script isa little dry. It looks like what you would expect from a big studio that cranks something out fast.The extras even annoy me. You know when a director has the extras standing out it really ruins it for meand it reflects on the director. Makes the movie look rushed.On the other hand. The time machine is pretty cool to look at. The plot moves quick enough.It could be fun. There are some good shots of San Francisco in the 70s.I only got half way through it might have picked upafter a while.
3,"Mildly intriguing story premise, slow movie","This movie was altogether average. Slow, mildly entertaining, decent acting. Considering there are millions of movies to watch, I would not recommend spending 2 hours on it."
3,Original time travel crime story,"I bought this DVD mostly based on the glowing reviews that I read here. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. Yes the performances of the actors are good as far as they go but it did feel a bit staged. David Warner was excellent even though he did not have much screen time. Steenburgen seemed unrealistically infatuated with McDowell for my taste and he appeared a bit to detached from reality (even considering the strangeness his character experiences). The special effects in the related 1960s movie were far better - well I know this one was not about special effects but about the story. But then again, if you watch time travel movies would you not want to see something special? I gave it three stars but honestly it feels more like 2.5."
1,New keepcase edition is poorer....,"Warner issued this way back in 2002 with a better cover and in the old 'snapper' case but what was excellent was that that edition was in the original 2.35:1 ratio as opposed to this 1.77 to 1 ratio. The picture quality of the older edition is better and as intended to be views by Nicholas Meyer, the director. One can still pick up the older edition here at Amazon but not for long...Time After Time"
5,Great escape movie.,"Based on H.G. Wells ""The time machine"" this is a great adaption. It features three great actors and the story is terrific. Made in 1979 it is still charming."
5,Time after Time,"this is a truely great movie, great actors, killer story line.I have always loved this movie, I saw it on the Amazon website and just had to have it!And i am pleased to say it didn't disapoint"
2,Still didn't fit!,"Even with all the attachments, this diffuser did not fit my Conair hair dryer. I could barely squeeze on the largest fitting, but it would continually pop off while I was drying my hair and eventually cracked down the side from being shoved on too many times. I was very disappointed and ended up having to buy a new hair dryer that came with its own diffuser attachment. I am sure the product would be fine with the right hair dryer."
2,Doesn't fit my Helen of Troy Hair Dryer,"I bought this thinking b/c it had the different fittings to fit almost all size hair dryers that it would work with mine. It unfortunately did not fit my Helen of Troy hair dryer, so I end up holding it on, but that doesn't work well so it usually falls off. Very disappointed."
1,DIGITAL OSCILLOSCOPE,THIS IS A COMPACT AND INEXPENSIVE OSCILLOSCOPE. UNFORTUNATLY IS IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND THE DISPLAY IS VERY DIM.
2,Literally stinks,"Velleman makes some good stuff, and this scope looks way cooler in person than in the pictures. But it smells like the bugspray department of your local hardware store. It really reeks. I still smell it after leaving it outside for 2 days to air out. It says made in Taiwain. I have not turned it on. May just return it.(I've only ever encountered 2 pieces of electronics that smelled like this, a modem and a mouse, but neither was as bad as this.)"
4,better than expected,"The film is still enjoyable, doesn't seem dated. Other reviewers note the ghosting and quality of image, some saying it should only be viewed on smaller screens, but I found it to be, with the exception of a few short scenes, clear and sharp. Considering that I viewed it on a front projector system using a 12 food diagonal screen, I'd say that only the most critical viewers will object to the picture quality and those who are willing to accept small compromizes in order to add this film to their collections will be well pleased."
1,Very Bad Transfer,"Some of these MGM on demand DVD's have been very nice, but this one has very poor quality. There is extreme ghosting in the image. Chuck Heston looks like he has two noses in an early scene! Even the MGM Home Video logo looks terrible. Probably wouldn't be too horrible on a really small television, but this is a mess on bigger screens. Avoid it. They need to re-author this DVD. It's amazing this got released."
1,"Great movie, lousy media","Read the complete ad when thinking about buying this one. This movie is burnt on a 4.7GB DVD-R standard disc. This means, don't look for high quality playback.Pay particular attention to the information regarding this production of the media this movie was placed. I should have read and ""paid"" attention to the complete ad. If I had realized this great movie was put on a cheap DVD-R disc, I would have never purchased it. This is not the sellers fault. This is the producers fault.So if you're interested in getting this great movie on a good high quality media, then look elsewhere, because the following information should be a factor of chasing you away from this purchase.""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.""I plan on donating this to my local library, because I don't want this cheap stuff in my personal collection. I'd be embarrassed if my family and friends saw it on the shelves of my library."
4,the hawaiians,"Good history, Good acting, Good actors,Good scenes, heartfelt scenes, Mako is magnificent in this movie, also character of Woo Chow Auntie!"
2,Not quite what it seems,"This DVD was said to be English/Spanish, but on playing it in our DVD we could not adjust to English dialogue. We tried 2 different DVD machines but could not find a way to adjust.On my computer I could copy this DVD with the English dialogue - not play it direct, but COPY it. Then we could watch it in English."
1,groannnnnn,"Despite Charlton Heston giving his entire single talent to this offering (yes it is the same one-dimensional character we have grown to love from the ""Ten Commandments' to 'Planet of the Apes', this movie never seems to rise above it's banal screenplay and moronic dialogue. Lovingly filmed in multi-color ""racist stereotype"", this film is perfect for those who never look beyond their own narrow existence and unquestionably accept for fact anything that is set before them. Enjoy!!!"
5,Olaf Stapeldon,"Truly a masterpiece. This single book will take you on a trip the likes of which will stay with you for a long time. I have read and reread this book, passed it on, recommended, gifted, etc. for many years."
5,all time best science-fiction,"Wow! Having read over 120 science-fiction books, this one is surely one ofthe very best. There is a strong possibility this book was not a work offiction but reality because of the incredible similarity to the realcosmos. Get ready for a mind journey like no other that goes on and onand on thru so many worlds, so varied, unique, and beautiful. One of thedeepest sci-fi's ever. Timeless and valid regardless of technicaladvancments of humanity. This will be outstanding reading even 1000 yearsfrom now. Starts a little slow but really gets going ..."
4,A milestone.,"Although I just began reading novels a few years ago, I could tell Star Maker was no regular book. I often found myself struggling with Stapledons long explanations , but also dumbstruck by his grand description of the Star Maker. After I finished the book I went outside and looked at the stars, then proceeded to put on headphones and listen to ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss. It was then that I got a glimpse of what this book was really about."
5,One night when I had tasted bitterness...,"It must be about 10 years since I read this transcendental novel (after reading a recommendation in that amazing history of science fiction co-written by Brian Aldiss) and the flavour still lingers. It is nothing short of a speculative history of the universe! Recently, listening to the Brian Eno song Spinning Away (on the Wrong Way Up album, recorded with John Cale), I thought I detected a connection or two... has Brian read Olaf? I'll be rereading Star Maker very shortly."
5,Best value for premium binoculars,"Comparable to the ""big 4"" high dollar binoculars in terms of build and optical quality. The view (sharpness, brightness, contrast, color) is comparable to any binocular made at any price except for the flatness of field. The edge sharpness is a step down from the high end Nikon and Swarovski binoculars and slightly below the Zeiss and Leica models. It appears that the focus point in the center is not the sharpest focus for the edges. I still rated them 5 stars because they are such a great value at Amazon's price."
2,"not as ""smelly"" as i'd hoped",This bath bomb didn't give off as much smell as I had hoped. It did make my skin nice and silky smooth and the little bits of coconut in the bomb was a surprise floating in the water!
4,Magnet to Steele,"Just what I had expected...good solid rockin' backbeat...great guitar with strong vocals to match...I have always been a fan of Brian (Too Loud) MacLeod's work and I am very happy to add this CD to my collection. Thanks to my friends on Vancouver Island for turning me on to it. Thanks to Amazon for getting me this slightly dated CD so quick. Chrissie Steele Rocks! I would like to hear more of her. Chrissie's vocals are comparable to other notable female rockers of that time period such as Sass Jordan, Nancy Wilson or Pat Benatar in my humble opion. It is tragic that Mr. Macleod is not here on this earth to share his gift with us....Damn Cancers......Rock On Chrissie Steele wherever you are!!"
3,Rock On,"Chrissy Steele was another one of the ""too tough for pop"" rocker chicks that seemed to be everywhere in the first couple years of the `90s. Like similar artists Saraya, Harlow, Cell Mates, Robin Beck, Skew Siskin, and especially Headpins, Chrissy Steele's music was pretty straightforward rock & roll that bordered on being AOR. Steele's voice was tough without sounding raspy, and seems perfectly suited to this type of music."
1,Good collection but......,"I was so excited to receive this collection. I watch Niagara right away. The next day I put in Marilyn, the final days and the excitement was gone. The movie skipped and froze throughout the ENTIRE dvd. I thought I bought this new not used?"
4,More features,"While the films are a great choice and the prints are in great shape, how about some commentaries, deleted scenes, featurettes. Except for SEVEN YEAR ITCH, there is nothing. Marilyn made so few films, only 12 starring roles, as compared to other superstars who've made dozens, I wish there were more to each movie...expecially deleted scenes. I know every one of these film had deletions, but no one has ever said WHAT WAS DELETED. In the case of NIAGARA, much must have been deleted because it seems so choppy. Never sure what day is when. In BLONDES, the first part of the movie also seems a bit disjointed, and one night moves into the next without explanation. I know Mr. Zanack was a stickler for short films and he cut his films a bit too much. So when and if new materials are found and put in these films, I won't be buying any more of them."
5,After reading about NormaJeane I do believe she was enormously talented,"I was so interested in NormaJeane and her psychological background. I read most of the major autobiographies. I do think this woman was driven. I think she made some bad decisions choosing a lifestyle which including drugs. In her days they did not know long term effects of any drug much less barbiturates. Certainly her alcohol use with the drugs truely made her Hollywood's child. I found her a mass of conflicting impulses. She never really bonded to the classical female role. Early in her life she did, until ambition won. She was extravagently beautiful. She could not nuture female relationships, probably due to her mother's dismal contributions to her upbringing. These movies reflect what she became. What she had strived for all her life. I enjoyed them because of her true talent and remarkable beauty. I was too young when they were released."
5,The Best of Marilyn at one stop!,"This collection may not have every film of Marilyn's but it does have the best of the best as it includes both ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" and ""The Seven Year Itch""."
2,Not Marilyn at her best,This is not one of MM's best movies. She's still gorgeous but not in her best shape. Jack Cole does what he can with choreography however chorus boys merely haul her around. Co-star Yves Montand is stiff and unattractive and his accent makes him unintelligible. Their chemistry level is zero. It's a dumb script with not much for the actors to do.
2,Marilyn Monroe Special anniversary collection,"So I hadn't have time to write a review intill now. When the package came I was happy that it came early. Then I opened the the box and the Collection box was ripped and had dashes on it. Then i open that and pulled out all six of the DVD cases and Two of them are from different collections (Marilyn Monroe: The Diamond Collection) To be exacted. So they were messed match. And some came with the dvd slip and some didn't. I'm not happy with the fact that they said it was ""like New"" Wich clearly it wasn't. I would never buy anything from theses people after this. The Dvds work good. thats the only reason why i'm giving it two stars."
1,If you are buying for the interview with Tiny Tim...,"On the odd chance that you're buying this for the interview with Tiny Tim, all I can say is don't! You can find the exact same interview elsewhere on the internet. I purchased this thinking there would be more to the interview (as the version currently viewable on the internet cuts out in the middle of a sentence), but I was disappointed to find the same one here."
1,A Grainy Teasing Rip Off,"Every so often people trot out this Barbra Streisand ""porno"" tape. For once and for all IT IS NOT BABS.The footage is a sloppy, grainy black & white mess. The DVD has a bar blocking out any view of genital nudity and...IT IS NOT BABS!The woman is actually a well known Jewish porn actress from the late 70s/early 80s named Tasha Vous.The other notorious film here: the Go-Go's backstage ""porno"" consists of a drunken and drugged out, bleary eyed Belinda Carlisle and a sweaty Kathy Valentine trying unsuccessfully to get some girl fan to give one of their roadies head. She will only jack him off, he can't get hard and all Carlisle does is yack, yack, yack. Carlisle, Valentine or the girl fan don't get naked and really nothing happens.Once again you will not find any hardcore pornography or clear nude shots here."
1,Do't waste your time or money,"This DVD being offered looked like it might be a new one since the release date was Dec 2007---but it was a total disappointment. This consist of 4 songs taken off of a DVD I already own that is a concert in Orlando Church Street Station. That was a much older concert of Tanya, as she looked to be in early 20's with short hair.There is only one other thing on this DVD and that is a short excerpt of the history of country music.Save your money!!This is absolutely not worth the money."
2,Find another book,Matisse did some good interior pictures but many run-of-the-mill nudes and this book has way too many of those
3,Nice Calm Evening.,"I have some old Iron Butterfly, and hadn't listened to thier one hit that ran for 17 minutes in a long time. They had made a few more albums but I lost interest. I saw this album by Mike Panera, I couldn't remember how much of a part he played in Iron Butterfly. 'In the Garden of Eden' is a mix of '80s tunes, some nice love ballads ""Touch My Heart"" and ""In the Garden of Eden"" are a couple of good love songs. ""Fantasy of Love' is kind of jazzy, but he keeps interest with ""Ride Captain, Ride"" and ""In s Gadda de Vida"". Over all it's a nice mellow '80s genre album."
1,FAKE!! knock off imposter,I thought this did not work or smell this the real Bumble and bumble and then I went back to the salon and bought one to confirm my suspicions.....this is a knock off. DO NOT BUY THIS!! this is not the real product.
3,it's decent,"For the price of this item, i expected it to be a little more that what it has done for my hair. it makes it easier to comb but works no better than any other leave in conditioner. the smell is different from most other bumble and bumble products. it's got an earthy like, woods-y, tea tree oil scent to it. something i'd imagine a hippie to smell like, which is okay but definitely not the best. i have to admit, i am a little disappointed. next time i buy a leave in conditioner, i will opt for something cheaper with a better scent."
1,Air Freshener for your Hair,"For those of you who like to add an extra step of grooming in the morning with no measurable results, look no further. This is the product! I have been a faithful B & B user for over ten years (and have converted others to the seaweed shampoo and conditioner!) and this stuff is a waste of money. It smells good (really good) but then it evaporates leaving my hair no more manageable, shiny or conditioned than before. It's like a handshake for your hair. I feel cheated for having spent the money. Learn from my mistake!"
1,not the real thing from amazon!,"Bb Tonic is a great product, unfortunately not the same product when ordered through amazon. I agree with imposter!! Wasted my money, threw it away..."
4,Good product,"My good friend, who is also my stylist, uses this in her salon and recommended it. I love it. I spray it on after I wash my hair and then blow dry and straighten with a flat iron. I have thick hair so it sounds weird to say I need more texture, but it texturizes my hair so it doesn't just sit on my head. It kind of defines the strands, which shows off highlights. Also, because of the tea tree oil, or something like that, in it, it helps keep my hair clean longer. I can go 3-4 days between washes, which is great. I'm all about low maintenance. I see myself using this product for a long time to come. And the price here is the best I have found."
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,This product did nothing for my hair or style. Directions say to use before the Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray. I used as directed a few times and did not like the feel of my hair after it was dry. My hair is short so maybe someone with long more tangled hair will see a difference. I would not buy again. Not worth the money.
3,"Not sure what it does, but it smells nice!","I love this tonic. But why? It smells nice.I notice no other reason to use it. I am not a blow-dryer, so I see no benefit there. I spritz it on after a shower and let my hair dry naturally. I suppose it could be said that I notice a little 'texture' added to my rather fine but thick hair.I do not feel the tingle that they speak of on my scalp. But that may have more to do with the abuse my scalp has taken in 15 years of hair dyeing."
5,Very useful,"I use this product almost every day. My hair is fine and doesn't take abuse very well. This product helps keep my hair hydrated - but not oily, greasy or weighted down. It is also great for a quick touch up once my hair is dry. It also seems to support the other bumble and bumble styling products. I swear the defrizz works better if I use this first. I don't know about the scalp tingling bit as mentioned on the bottle, but I can definitely live without that."
4,Bumble Tonic Lotion,Love it! I spray it before blow drying to protect my hair without weighing down. Hair is soft and smells great. Now i get it at a cheaper price then salons.
3,pidgeon english,"The translation of this fascinating book is as bad as any translation of any book translated from any language into English. It could easily be the product of a French high-school student, after two years of study of English, with the aid of an abridged dictionary. If there is another translation of it, look for that one: it could not be worse."
2,A political book!,"If you are expecting a history of cathedral building, look elsewhere. This is slow and a bit dull, concentrates on extraneous issues ( the ego od Suger gets more coverage than St Denis itself), and even worse -- it's political. Yes, marxist-french anti-American screeds in a book on cathedrals. Oy."
3,THE BREEDER,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK, I HOPE THERE IS A PART TWO, I HATE THAT THEY LEFT ME HANGING AT THE END, IS THERE ANOTHER BOOK OUT TO FOLLOW THIS ONE. WHAT EVER HAPPEND TO THE BABY, AND JANET AND EZRA, YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW REAL CLOSE AND IT WAS A PAGE TURNER, IT TOOK ME TWO HOURS TO READ THIS BOOK, I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN."
5,Very interesting,"Very interesting read. Fascinating to get the inside scoop from one of bebop's legends. WRitten in an unassuming, nonchalant style."
5,Hawes is an inspiration,This is one of the most honest portraits of a human being you will ever find.. I would recommend this along with Charles Mingus' 'Beneath the underdog' for a taste of the 'jazz life'. It is amazing what these guys lived through - and still created such beautiful music!
5,From the perspective of a novel writer...,"I picked up this book as I am a Christian sci-fi/fantasy writer, and I am researching the genre. I was somewhat hesitant to read a book which was written clearly as a Christian novel as others I've read are so kitch and cheesy. The complexity of plot, background, technology, theology and human nature Chris Walley has put into this book is amazing. He outstrips the other Fantasy and Sci-Fi writers who I had previously held dear. I am very impressed and have quickly ordered the other two books in the series. I can't wait to see how it evolves and ends. Chris' characters are three dimensional, real and appealing. Their struggles and humanity are genuine and beautifully expressed. The story line really makes you think about what you hold dear, and how we actually think compared to how we'd like to be! Inspiring and a very entertaining read."
3,A Misleading Description,"I was expecting more tables and equations especially for natural convection external flow. There is also very little useful information about forced convection external flow. I also would have liked to see some sample calculations to demonstrate how to use this book better.There is plenty of theory despite the product's description and most of it is probably unnecessary for a handbook. It's more like a big, expensive text for heat transfer than a handbook. A person would have to be an engineer, mathematician, or physicist to deal with the level of mathematics presented in this book.There is a fair amount of information about internal flow for both forced and natural convection, but this book's value is quite limited. I am dissappointed with this book and would not purchase it again if I lost it."
1,NEVER BUY DIGITAL JAZZ!!!,"Jazz will never sound as it should when mastered on a digital format. Analog vinyl LP's or magnetic tape (as a distant second) is the best way to go. You will NEVER know what you are missing out on without a decent turntable and tube amplifier. Try listening to Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"" or Kenny Drew's ""Undercurrent"" mp3 album and then find someone who owns it on vinyl and listen... you will never buy another cd or mp3 again and you may want a refund for all those mp3's you bought. Digital jazz is garbage and should only be used while jogging or when not really paying attention to the music (i.e. mowing your lawn)."
5,Love it!,Excellent product. I use this in damp hair and then straighten with blow dryer. Wonderful results!! Very nice smooth hair without looking like it has any hair product in it. It doesn't leave residue at all.
5,Wow,It's neat seeing what Mr Lewis thought before he turned to Christianity. He is very detailed in this book about what he saw the problem of God.
1,Book,Hard to read. Maybe I need to get more intellect behind myself before tackeling such a book as this. I'll try again in a while an see if it is easier later.
1,Not the read I expected,I thought Calvin was dry but this book and it's repetitions beat him by a mile. Facts could have been contained in a few pages. When you can read the great men referred to in the text for yourself why bother with this.RR
2,Only for true blue CS Lewis devotees,"CS Lewis is not as highly regarded in poetry as he is inchildren's fiction, science fiction, Christian apologetics, andliterary criticism.Moreover, this book was written before his converted to Christianity. You will therefore NOT know Lewis if this is all you're ever going to read of his works, and that would be a pity. He is simply one of the best in the business, with a very well focused and well defined moral vision..."
3,Another great DVD from Baron!,"If you havent tried one of Baron's DVD's then this is a must have. If you have never taken one of Baron's Foundations of Power Vinyasa workshops, then this is a must! If you are new to Yoga, this is a must.If you have taken the workshop, then this is a refresher for you. This video really goes over the basics of a Sun Salutation, but is still a great reminder on how to perfect the pose.I consider this DVD a great addition to my collection. Thank you Baron! Cant wait for some more."
1,Stop talking!,"I have heard great things about Baron's classes so I was pumped to try this DVD. I made it 10 minutes. The initial poses weren't bad, but he wouldn't stop talking. It was like he loved to hear his own voice and felt like he had to keep a running dialogue of babble. I have nothing against suggestions for improving postures or even encouragement but Baron goes past this and into an annoying territory. I will not be doing this DVD again."
2,Beware of the Title,"Understand when purchasing this DVD that the emphasis is on the ""Foundations"" not the ""Power Vinyasa"". This DVD is big on explaining the positions more so than moving through them. So if you are new to yoga and need instruction on postures, then this is for you - the explanations are great. However, if you are a regular power yoga practitioner, the explanations will get in the way of a good vinyasa style workout for you."
2,Okay yoga dvd,The yoga series presented was fine but this isn't the type of dvd I'd use over and over. Baron spends a lot of time talking and his mannerisms will get annoying after the second or third time through. I found myself sweating after the second sun salutation series but just couldn't get past how much he talks throughout the dvd.
3,"Christmas, Yes.... Celtic, No.","Once again I was misled by the word ""Celtic"" in the title. I'll have to beware of St. Clair productions in future, if this is their idea of celtic.This just doesn't have any celtic influence that I could hear.Actually it sounded like my local church's organ recital of Christmas music. It has over 60 minutes of ponderous holiday classic tunes. Maybe okay for background music, but I think I'll give it away.One of the tunes is ""Feliz Navidad"" which must be a big hit in Ireland. ;-)The CD also had 2 skips on it, even though it was new, straight from the package."
2,Not as good as expected,"For DDF, I'm not a fan. I liked their face scrub that is discontinued. Best bet after years of hard searching, antiseptic wash found at your local pharmacy. Stuff is AMAZING"
3,Not As Good,"Where I saw their former release, ""Love Junk"" as being a great classic alternative rock album, I found their follow-up, ""One-Sided Story"" to be more of a parody of what The Pursuit of Happiness was doing back then and even recognized Moe Berg's lead vocals being more like Weird Al Yankovic than his own. No need to listen closely to that observation when spinning through ""Survival"" or ""My Neighborhood"" and it's clear.The music is more of a slimmed down copy fo their former release and not as ""into it"" as any band could manage when trying to make a follow-up to their debut success album.There really was no steam left in the band by this time and it's apparent why they never went any further than this album, as far as success was concerned.They were a good band in their time and ""Love Junk"" is a definitive classic and one that needs at least one spin in your lifetime to understand where we were musically in 1989 when all else was beginning to fail."
4,Three of the original Funk Brothers in action,"This is a live DVD recorded with only 3 of the original Funk Brothers: Bob Babbitt, Uriel Jones, and Eddie Willis. I thought there would be more original musicians of Motown's ""Snake Pit"". It seems that Jack Ashford has his own ""Funk Brothers"" band, and some of the other musicians aren't alive anymore or just not interested in hitting the road again. With the exception of the great vocals of Marcia Ware, the other singers are ok. I'd say that the other band members are just as skilled as the FB trio. So it's a great show to watch, although I wish there had been one produced just as well as ""Soul Comes Home"" (celebrative show of Stax Records' singers/groups), for the Funk Brothers.If you want to see most of the original FB in action, try ""Standing In The Shadows of Motown"". This is a fantastic documentary released in 2003. Some of the members that gave in interviews for this film are already deceased, so it's an important piece of Motown history."
3,Live Inn Orlando,"This is a piece of American History that should not only be cherished but taught to our youth. What an amazing story of talent, triumph over adversity, and loyalty to friendship. I cannot thank ""Dr. Licks"" enough for his ten years of love and commitment that causesd this buried history to be brought to light for the world to the see."
4,Funk Brothers - Engine room of Motown,"Nice to see this recording of the Funk Brothers in their heyday. To view their musical artistry is a privelege, however some of the vocals on this recording did grate a little."
4,Great toy for little Princesses,"The Belville Summer PalaceLEGO Belville Royal Summer Palace (7582)is a great companion to the Winter Palace, even though it holds up well by itself. The Royal Family included with the set allows kids to play to their hearts content. I have always loved the versatility of Lego toys and this set is no exception."
3,"Good, BUT missing something!!!","I bought this album way back in the day and wanted to have it on CD, but it's missing MADNESS!! I'm glad I still have the original album and the video! Dance Craze is still a good CD because you can't get a better compilation of British SKA than this."
5,Wonderful Ska Roots,"This is the music which first introduced me to Ska. In the mids of Blondi and Talkingheads was the English Beat. Ska with a decided New Wave bent. Still my favorite mix with groups like Save Farris. But this isn't a ""New Wave"" Ska albumn, allong with the English Beat are The Specials, Selector and other early 2nd wave Ska bands."
5,D want to find the Dance Craze movie,"I want to find the movie of Dance Craze. If you know someone who has a copy and is willing to sell it, send me an email at : skadfather01@hotmail.com"
4,Music Magic,"Great book, full of all kinds of helpful ideas for the studio novice. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get their business up and running!"
4,Extensive coverage,This book seems to cover just about every aspect of the teaching studio. It's a great reference to read before starting your business and encountering and solving dilemmas/problems throughout your teaching journey. He gives lots and lots of helpful answers and solutions to questions you may encounter along the way.
3,Pretty Cool,"I think Tiga is quirky and pretty cool. This cd is pretty good, some really good tracks and some I could live without."
3,Does not work with all-in-one (print/copy/scan) printers,"Before ordering, you should know from Ambicom's own support website that ""The following printers will not compatible with the wireless printer kit:Laser printerInkjet printer with memory card readerPhoto printer with memory card readerMulti-functional (All-In-One) printerand printer that is not listed on the chart"""
3,Is it slow? Yes. Is it under my desk? No,"I no longer have to be a contortionist to load paper into my printer. Now I just step across the room and easily drop it in. However a color print job on my Epson C82 seems to be fairly plodding where it was relatively quick before. Text seems fine for small jobs. I am yet to attemp a photo. I have not been able to test the range yet but I can't imagine a need for a home printer 100 feet from me, I live in a condo for Pete's sake. If I ever need to relocate my printer to my balcony I will amend this post. Keep in mind that if you buy this you need two outlets. One for the printer power and one for the printer end of the adapter. I think I may actually relocate my printer to my bathroom just for amusement purposes.I now have a network printer and would advise anyone to skip this older technology and get with the WiFi world."
2,Not the Original Artists,"These songs are not the original artists. Some of the songs sound fine, but some are really bad. The worst are ""Follow me"" and ""Hanging by a Moment."" Make sure you check out the audio samples."
3,too much luck & being mean,"I was looking for a quick, light game (like Lost Cities) as a filler between other, bigger games (Trajan, Agricola, etc). A game store employee recommended Jambo.In my 2nd game, my opponent luck-ed into lots of oppressive cards early in the game and promptly stole/ destroyed everything I built. Truly, I had nothing left. Even though I can normally lose a game and still have lots of fun (especially if I'm set collecting or train-ing) but I actually quit this game, gifting it to that opponent (a long-time, hard-core gamer who appreciated its game design).My take away: too much luck & being mean for my blood."
4,Fun for Two,"My husband and I had been looking for a game that we could play together. This game is very fun. It is always a challenge, no matter how many times you play. There is nothing I would change about it. The expansions are fun too. They make the game a little more interesting if you play it often."
3,played a few times-but getting better,"My husband and I were looking for a fun two-person game. This is okay, but not great.The goal of the game is to have more than 60 gold pieces and more than your opponent. You earn gold by buying and selling (for a profit) wares. Primarily the game uses a deck of cards which have various events, activities you can perform, or protections (as well as those cards which allow you to buy and sell).We both enjoy strategy games and although this is easy to understand, it doesn't seem to use much strategy. It seems more to be luck of the draw (which cards you happen to get). However, this may not quite be true if you play a few more times and learn how to use your turns in a more strategic fashion.We plowed through the game two or three times and it's getting more fun, but we have other games we prefer and are not sure that we want to spend the time getting to know this one. One game that we prefer far more is Lost Cities."
3,A solid game,"This game is solid. If you are used to the basic games of Sorry or Monopoly, Jambo will be fun as well. But compared to about forty or fifty other games also in the genre of German-style, Game of the year contenders, this game is not as interesting."
4,The bottle rockets hit a home run with this one !!!!!!!,"I have every Bottle Rockets CD to date, I enjoy everyone of them.I seen them live in Champaign Illinois in November 2003 and Theyblew me away, Every song has been written from the heart and really touches home to me. Blue Sky is now my favorite Cd. I play in an alt country band and I plan to add even more Bottle Rockets songs to my set list !!! I can't say enough about Brian Henneman's strong vocals and his ability to get such a great tone from an old Pevey guitar. I noticed he had Billy Joe Shaver's autograph on his guitar and that confermed what I already knew....This guy has great taste !!!!!You can't go wrong with Shaver or the Bottle Rockets."
3,"good, not great","I love the Bottle Rockets, but this isn't their best work. Some really good songs but some duds too."
1,A darn shame...,"After having been ""the biggest BoRox fan alive"" since their debut record (yeah, I know there are hundreds of us) I couldn't believe the turn they'd taken with this new record. Long story short, without Eric ""Roscoe"" Ambel at the helm producing, leader Brian Henneman seems to have completely lost focus. Here's hoping the band returns to they roots and get back to making great music again, with or without Roscoe. Hope..."
2,I'm so dissapointed!,"Bottle Rockets have become Brian Hennemans blues project. For all fans of the old hard hittin countryrock albums back in the mid 90's, there's nothing left.I'll now hope that Henneman will relese his soloproject Diesel Island, cause theres where you find the country spirit he still got."
3,What happened to Free's songwriting?,Some of the tunes are just repetitve riffs. Karma Sutra is just awful. The Electric Warrior album got me hooked on Micki Free as a solo artist. I have dug him ever since his Shalamar days. The Crown of Thorns material that he did with Jean Beauvoir is far superior to this album. Even the production quality isnt what it should be as the midrange is muddled and Free's voice is hard to hear. I paid alot for this disc since it is an import. I wish I could have previewed it before spending so much and not waiting to find a cheap used copy somewhere.
3,Helped Me,I like this product I'm going back into the workforce and I needed a boost of confidence when talk with strangers. I also like the fact that I can put this on my nano verus reading a book were people can see what you are reading.
1,Where's The Beef,"I knew I was purchasing an abridged CD, but what I didn't know was this CD is only 40 minutes long? It looks like it is a #1 of others. Not happy paying for a CD that is abridged at only 40 minutes. How long is the unabridged. Is there an unabridged out there. How long is it, and how much is it."
1,Nothing Insightful,Just plain common sense. There wasn't profound thought through out the whole book. I finished in thirty minutes.
2,Don't waste your money,This was a waste of money. Most advice was common sense that anyone over 25 has heard many times.
4,"superb, it works and it's great!","i quite enjoy this book. it's one of those books where ppl would just want to read it over and over again. It works and it's great, i was just hoping for more info in detail. overall it's just great!"
2,The tape is far too brief and general.,I found that the audio version was too brief to be of much practical help in starting a conversation and keeping it going. Debra Fine's audiobook on Small Talk was much more helpful with both practical reminders and specific suggestions.
1,This series is excellent,"I've watched this series on video from my local library, and it is a top notch documentary exploring the many phases of American Cinema. I wish I'd had access to a series like this when I was taking a university course in film way back in the late 70's.However, the price that these companies are asking for this series (from $225 to $1800 dollars) is totally bogus and ridiculous.A DVD costs less than a dollar, and you're asking for these absurd prices! A fair price would be maybe 50 dollars, but $1800?I hope that nobody is actually paying these prices from these sellers."
5,A Family Tradition,"My father purchased this recording in vinyl for $1.49 in 1959. It became our family's favorite album, and soon sounded the worse for wear. We scoured the Christmas bins in record stores every year for a replacement. but could only find the Jimmy Joyce version, which is ok, but not as good.A few years ago it became available on CD. Unfortunately, Dad did not live to hear it. However, every year it is the first Christmas CD I play, for both its beauty and its nostalgia. The songs are beautiful, and are a quiet reminder of what Christmas should be about."
4,PA as it was for my Scotch-Irish Pioneer Ancestors,"I bought this book for answers to my title above. It is a slow read, but the book is chock full of info of interest to me. It would be difficult to read it without background knowledge of PA history for the period 1600-1800. I am still enjoying the book as I read it at my leisure. Aloha, Ed Conner"
1,not as advertised,"This pillow was advertised as coming from the Company (Hudson) which is why I bought it. I love those pillows. The one I received was from the company (Core) which is different. If I knew that it was coming from a different company, I would not have bought it. The pillow is made differently, too hard, and not comfortable for me. Please do not misadvertise where your products come from. It is frustrating."
5,By Far The Best Nothing Face Album!,"This is so much better than ""Everyday Atrocity"" and ""Violence"". This one is just rawer and heavier. Every song on here rules, but the two best would have to be ""Defacer"" and ""Pacifier"".""Everyday Atrocity"" and ""Violence"" seem too melodic. ""Goldtooth"" is the only good song on ""Everyday Atrocity"" and it RULES! ""Can't Wait For Violence"", and ""Hidden Hands"" are the only good songs on ""Violence""."
1,New Product Arrived Unplayable,"Like the reviewer whose comments I just read, I also don't know how to rate this item because it will not play on my or anybody else's DVD player. I bought the thing new & planned on using it in class tomorrow. Opened the shrink wrap and factory seal & all I get on my machines and my neighbors' is the main menu and then an error message no matter what I select from the menu. Scary. How do these people stay in business?"
4,Pooh Ponderings,"Oh, it's time for a little review! Such a cute book with so many Pooh inspirational sayings, I just love it! Great sayings to read for yourself on a little blue day, or to send to a loved one to cheer them! Brings us back to the basic observations of life, so simple yet profound."
5,it makes my math class,I love it !!! Its very helpful in math class and easy to learn hoe to operate it in regular basic math.
5,I highly recommend!!!,"I bought this calculator when I was in the 9th grade. I am now in my 5th year as a civil engineer and it finally gave out on me last semester. I attempted in replacing it with a different calculator, but quickly realized that I missed this calculator - the way it felt in my hands, its ease of use and its reliability. I luckily found this same model again at Target. This calculator has always gotten the job done for me. I highly recommend it, especially for the price!"
4,casio fx 300ms plus 229 function scientific calculator,"Aun cuando las calculadores llegaron una semana después a mi casa, tengo que dar crédito al vendedor por su preocupación en como empaco el producto, el cual llego muy bien. En cuanto alas calculadoras son muy bonitas(mejor que en la foto) y son muy fáciles de usar, y el precio razonable, pienso que como compre varias debió haberme dado una rebaja :), pero esta bien!.Gracias"
4,good product,Cheap but good calculator. Though the hand feeling is a little hampered by some loose part moving inside the calculator. It can make a tiny sound when you are holding it and pressing buttons.
1,Keypad Failed,"I purchased this calculator for office work in May 2011. After barely three months of use, the keypad no longer inputs the correct numbers. Enter 852.2 and the calculator enters 74100. There is only a 30 day return policy, so now it's just a piece of trash.Badly done Casio."
5,nice calculator,"hello to all,This is a very nice calculator. I got directly from amazon.com ,The service was excellent and the product was very good. I recommend Amazon.com to buy it they have excellent service.thank you."
1,too scientific to describe the malfunctions,"i'm unhappy that the contrast to control its lightness or darkness is malfunctioning. maybe, that feature is too elementary for the scientific calculator such as this. i'll rate it one star. i detect no problem in its tremendous ability to do the arithmetic."
2,Fake introduction!,"In the introduction, it is said that ""the FX-300w features a two-line display and supports complex number calculations, algebra, calculus, and 18 levels of parentheses. "" However, I cannot find any complex number calculation function on user's guide. I try to find it by choosing different mode but there is indeed no complex function! Very disappointed!"
4,casio FX-300,"I like casio calculators. however, this one is a bit bulky if you will like to carry this with you."
4,Calculator,I was pleased with this product and would recommend it; although it could have had a bit better explanation of functions.
3,Good product,"I like the calculator especially the 2 line large display that shows all the calculations. However, you need to be careful to avoid scratches to the exterior etc."
1,Be careful on the bugs of this calculator,"Ok, this calculator looks great value with the amont of features, but it also have a very serious bug. The Store and recall function will give you a wrong answer if you do something like this:1 STO A2 STO BRCL A + RCL BThe answer depends on a previous calculation.As a summary, buy this calculator only if you think that money is more important than your projects, grades etc."
5,Good stuff,"I bought it for my chemistry class, I used it for class, homework and exams. It can do its job perfectly."
4,good product worth buying,"It has typical functions a calculator should have: arithmetic, algebraic, trigonometrical, and basic statistics. The layout and color codes for next layer functions are also clear. One feature that is missing is the function to turn an input into a negative number. In its simpler version it is obvious. But not on this model. That costs it one star. Otherwise, a very versatile calculator."
4,good......i would go for a ti though,"this is alright, the plastic is not cheap but rather hard.....the case slides on with difficulty.....and the keys can get stuck inside sometimes, but it does the work....and i really liked how it showed your previous calculations, which really helped.....i bought this for the SATs and would recommend it for any math class up to algebra2"
4,Casio FX-300 just as advertised,I purchased this for taking to the JAA pilot exams as they do not allow one with a programmable options.It arrived quicker than I would have expected in it retail packaging.It has worked exactly as I would have expected.
5,Amazing calculator!,"My only complaint, and it's only shortcoming, is that this calculator will not solve 1 divided by 0. I have had it for about 3 years, and it still works perfectly. No buttons have broken, the screen is still fine, and it has a very quick response. The LCD screen is superbly clear, and the buttons are the perfect size. They feel so right under your fingertips...... almost like a math spa!"
5,Worth the money!,"I bought this for my twins when they turned one and they have played with it every day since! It is exceptionally made and really cute! The only negative thing I would say is that when your child tries to climb back and forth between the front and back compartments and they hold on to the handle bar for stability, the car will tip forward. Overall, I am happy I paid the extra money for this toy!"
3,Rust after first cycle in dishwasher,This is a good price for these pizza wheels but be warned Do Not put these in the dishwasher. The bolt rusted completely after one wash.
3,"Big size, but nut already rusting","This was part of a 4 for 3 promo. I have an excellent pizza cutter that is over 10 years old. I hoped this would be as good, but the nut on the back is already rusting... after only month or so use. If I cant find a replacement nut, this may end up in the trash."
2,Clumsy Episode with Dubious Moral Wisdom,"Catherine befriends a gypsy boy who has been disowned by his grandparents and turned out into the streets due to an alleged misdeed of the boy's deceased father. Vincent and Catherine help the boy clear his father's name in order to facilitate reunification with the grandparents. This is a questionable goal considering their values are such that they were willing to disown the boy based on something his FATHER had supposedly done. An all-around clumsy episode relying on such things as doltish villains to reach its ""happy"" ending.In 1998 I conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale. 31 fans participated. ""Everything is Everything"" finished 37th out of the 44 episodes.I placed ""Everything is Everything"" 44th in my own personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering of the episodes."
2,Mis represented,Again this product was badly mis represented in the ad. By looking at the ad you think you are buying a set of brushes but you are only buying 1 brush. Do not think I will order from them again. Also the shipping was very slow. I had to email the company to see what was happening and they didn't even reply as to what was going on.
4,A Redeemer,"I loved the first two books in this series and hated the third one ""Texan's Luck"". I almost didn't read the ""Texan's Reward"" but I am so glad that I did. Ms. Thomas certainly redeemed herself with this one.The characters were real and didn't do things that made no sense like I found in ""Texan's Luck"". Despite it all, they always loved one another and that was never in question.Good job, Ms.Thomas."
3,...What happened?,"This was not very romantic. I kept waiting and waiting for their love scene, and not even that happens! They kiss, they feel, they hug, that's it. There were too many characters in this book that kept getting in the way. It seemed like every time they were going to get closer something else happened to break them apart again. It was so frustrating because there wasn't much build-up to go along with that. Not really sure what Thomas was doing while she wrote this but it's like it wasn't finished. Nell and Jacob were so perfect for each other, I felt they deserved a better story than this."
5,"Fast delivery, great condition","This is my first purchase on Amazon, and I was very happy to get my book 4 days after I ordered it online. I didn't pay for the express mail either. The book was in perfect condition. I would use this seller again."
1,"horrible, but the first two of worth reading","I have the first two books in this series and they are keepers but this one was a waste of time. There was little romance between the two characters. There wasn't a lot of sexual tension to keep you reading on and wanting more. I just couldn't get into it, something was definitely missing. The book was too slow paced and the story line seemed forced. Skip this one and read the first two"
4,Another one to love!,"After reading the previous 3 stories, I was so excited to finally find out what happens with Nell and Jacob!! As always, Jodi Thomas did a fabulous job and I just could not put the book down!I must say, I'm a little disappointed that the two main characters did not seem to spend much time in each others company. I would have liked to see more interaction between the two as Jacob realized just how much he really loves Nell.However, already knowing the two from the previous books, I didn't find anything lacking and was very happy with the end to this love story.A definite must read!"
3,a good read,"this began as a good read, but somewhere in the middle i was hoping for more to come. and the ending was definitely lacking. i just love jodi thomas and was soooo excited to get this in my paws but the first three installments were better. i wasn't as riveted here. and it was very transparent. could figure the story line from the first few chapters: old sheriff in town, he's a ranger, duh. and at the end when she's recovering from surgery, he has to go out of town, comes back to find. . .? no surprize there! i would rather read things i CAN'T write.but i still love jodi thomas and am still an avid fan, will always be."
3,Disappointing,Way too much going on in this book that took away from the two main characters story. There were so many secondary characters that took away from their story that all that seemed to happen was they kept getting pulled apart by other things going on and the story never had any real flow to it. It was like you had multiple stories going on and the two main characters really ended up being lost in with the secondary characters. Almost secondary characters themselves. Not what I expected and hoped for.
1,NOT the original artists,"Beware this album! I bought it hoping to get a good selection, but found it contains cheesy remakes that may have the same lyrics and beat as the original, but otherwise don't sound the same"
2,Blew out my fuse,"I was excited and happy for all of 10 minutes; then my lighter fuse blew out. Not sure if the heater would have gotten hot...but I won't know now until I can find my car owner's manual so that I can figure out which fuse needs to be replaced. On a good note, I got the item in a couple days!"
1,Not good...,"Not good..I purchased this project thinking we would have a way to defrost the windows on our old Olds' Intrigue, but that was not the case. The first time I plugged it in, it melted the plastic guard! I have not used it since. Waste of time and money. Delivery was fast. Possibly the only plus in this entire transactions. I do not receommend the product to anyone."
1,Worthless,"Unless I got a defective item, this thing is absolutely worthless. The power cord gets hotter than the air produced by the device itself. by the time what little air comes out and reaches the window, it does nothing."
1,Not Worth The Effort,This is the most feeble thing I have ever seen! My breath has more heat in it than this heater. The only way it would be of any value to me is to cut the cord off and use the cord for some other project. I would not take another one if you gave it to me!
1,Another piece of cheap junk,A barely perceptible amount of air and heat. It was hard to tell if the darn thing was on. Looks and feels cheaply made. I haven't used it for more than 5 minutes. I wonder if it will last 10.
1,Not worth it...,"Used it twice, both times it blew out a fuse. Then the unit itself fried. Not worth trying to return it so we just threw it away. Too bad someone doesn't make a high quality one of these..."
1,Don't waste your money,This was such a waste of money. I knew it wasnt' going to be a replacement for the cars actual heater but the thing didn't even get warm. I thought that it would at least blow warm air but did not. This product was not expensive but I felt like I just threw my money out the window.
1,useless,"I bought one of these things a few years ago... and as many other reviews have noted... it does not heat air... it only makes it less cold. It is a complete waste of money. When I bought it, they advertised it as something you could heat your car with and defrost your windows with, but it is only good at one thing... barely moving cold air while heating it to just a few degrees warmer than it was originally. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,It'll keep the frost off your bones...,"We purchased this a year ago after the heater core went out on us and winter set in. This is not going to replace the manufacturer-installed dash heating system in your vehicle... so, as long as you buy this with that reality in mind, you'll be pleased! It does take the edge off the cold and keep people in the car comfortable (of course, they also have winter coats on). We use this in our '97 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it does the job satisfactorily.Overall, glad we purchased this! Helps us put off fixing that heater core - which is major money!"
1,Blew a fuse!,"It worked for 10 minutes before blowing the fuse for my power outlet. The device is rated at 13 amps, but it blew a 20 amp fuse. Go figure... DON'T BUY THIS!!"
2,Received in proper order but item is not what was hyped,I expected an efficient heater but it's quite pathetic at what it is meant to do: heat up the car quickly while the car takes time to warm up during winter.But the shipping was prompt and I got a new package that has no defects.It was much smaller than it seems in the pictures.
4,It's ok,"I install Satellite tv, don't have time to wait for my car to warm up to defrost/defog the windows between customers. It works great for the purpose, but that's all it does, doesn't make a dent in warming my Ford Ranger, but I didn't expect it too. Just make sure you what your plugging into can take the amps, melted a outlet extender."
2,12 volt heater and fan,Does not blow out very much warm air. You can barely feel the warmth if you stick your hand right on it. Not very helpful when your car heater does not work. I would not recommend this heater.
3,12 V Heater/Fan,"The heater/fan is very small and really doesn't have the power to warm the car up, but on very cold days you can feel a touch of heat."
3,Didn't serve it's purpose,"I purchased this item as a gift to my daughter because the heater doesn't heat as well in her car as it should. She tried to use it one day and it never came on. We checked the plug in the car and it worked properly. Then the weather turned warm, so she didn't have to use it. I'll keep it, and try again next winter."
1,Does not put out enough heat - Don't waste your $$,"I bought this item because the heater in my car stopped working, what a joke, I used it a couple of times and then trashed it. If you want to feel any heat you must place this heater right next to your body. I do not reccomend putting it next to your body, just don't buy it!"
1,"Doesn't defrost, doesn't defog, and really doesn't do anything","Bought this exact item from an auto parts store and took it back. Bought it to defog my windshield. However, the hot air doesn't blow out of the top like the picture looks (making it good for defrosting/defogging) it blows out the side and there is no way to point it to get it to defog/defrost your window. Further, it doesn't put out enough heat to actually heat anything. I've got what the ""most helpful poster says"" about the packaging saying it was weak and you shouldn't expect a lot of heat. However, that doesn't escape the fact that this product doesn't do anything, even if wattage conversions would tell you that! I feel it is a reasonable and nonignorant expectation to expect a product to do something.p.s. If you want to warm your hands and face, I would suggest your pockets and a mask instead of shoving your face two inches away from an electrical object that doesn't really work...but that's just me."
3,Won't replace a vehicle heater but does work.,This won't completely replace your vehicle's heating system but will add some supplemental heat to a less efficient system. I have mine plugged into a 20 amp accessory port and it works fine without blowing fuses. If your port isn't 20 amp you will most likely have to direct wire it.
1,Did not work,This product did not work and ruined my car 12V plug in. I used it as the directions said and still it did this.
1,bad idea,"The heater did not work for long until it blew out my lighter fuse,my husband tried it in his truck and it blew his lighter fuse aswell."
2,Not what I needed,"This book is very vague especially relating to car accidents. I had much better luck with Car Accident Secrets. It contained more information and was very easy, had step by step instructions to follow. I would recommend purchasing Car Accident Secrets if you have been involved in a car accident."
1,Not relevant,"After reading this book from cover to cover and following all the suggestions, I went to a personal injury attorney and found out that this book is ""generic"" and doesn't apply to all cases, everywhere. All the time I put into it and none of it applied to me."
4,The Most Underrated Toto Album,"Toto was hammered by critics for this album even worse than they were for 1979's ""Hydra"". This was largely because Toto was experimenting with a much harder sound that cost them an audience (temporarily) at top 40 radio. Because of their reputation as an AM band, they were roundly rejected at rock radio too. In spite of the radio rejections, this is a pretty fine album with some great songs. ""I Think I Could Stand You Forever"" is one of my favorite songs and I am staunch in my belief that it's Steve Lukather's top solo. I'm a sucker for the catchy pop songs put to the harder rock sound - ""Gift With A Golden Gun"" and ""Live For Today"" are irresistable to me, and ""Turn Back"" is one of Toto's most unique songs. The real shortcoming of the album is the ballads - ""A Million Miles Away"" and ""If It's The Last Night"" are not their best. But as a big Toto fan, I've always lived with the highs and lows that come from their bold experimentation."
4,The Third and The Underrated,"Toto's third album in 1981 escaped from the glorious pop scene of 1981 despite its mainstream pop style in it. It is true that it lacks fiery punch the previous and the following album had but it should not be left to such obscurity either.ENGLISH EYES, my #1 favorite track is one of the highlights. It is surely the extension of Hydra's progressive approach somewhat Trillion-like. LIVE FOR TODAY is an excellent pop rock gem while I THINK I COULD STAND YOU FOREVER serves as prelude to renowned ""I Won't Hold Back"" a huge 1983 hit from Grammy-winning TOTO IV. GOODBYE ELENORE is a joyous up-tempo pop rock that is resurrected in recent 25th anniversary live album.Recommended for 80's pop rock fans that like Survivor, Chicago, Foreigner, and .38 Special."
2,TOTO STUMBLES ON TURN BACK,"Toto's third album is my least favorite effort of the band. While the music and performance is typical expert Toto, the songs themselves are mediocre and unmemorable, with the possible exception of IF THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT, a song more representative of the band's familiar style.No hit singles were culled from the album and although TURN BACK hit the album charts, it faded quickly. I also think Bobby Kimball's vocals seem strained---almost out of his range.Toto rebounded the following year with their incredibly successful TOTO IV. UltImately, any great band has a misfire....Toto's just came early!"
3,Pretty good material.,"Turn Back is a pretty good disc from Toto. There's a total of eight tracks, and I find all of them to be good and listenable. The album is in a pop rock musical direction. The musicianship is proficient, and the songwriting and production are good. It seems that there's more of an emphasis on the guitar playing on this album, too. The guitar and keyboard playing are tight and satisfying. There's some energetic material throughout, and the vocals are good. Some of the songs that I like are ""Turn Back"" and ""English Eyes."" I really do like Steve Lukather's guitar tone on ""English Eyes."" ""Turn Back"" is a cool tune, also. It's got a nice atmosphere to it, and the keyboard playing is sprightly. It also sports a really cool intro. The CD booklet contains the song lyrics. The album cover is also pretty interesting. This disc from Toto is good and worth a listen."
3,Not One Of Their Best,"This album and ""Hydra"" are the only Toto albums I don't much care for. Don't get me wrong, this album isn't bad, it's just kind of dull and plodding. The only song that really holds my attention is the title song ""Turn Back."" Toto doesn't have any bad albums, but this one isn't that great either."
5,Rock And Roll!,"The production on this third effort by Toto is less intense that on the others, but this album is nonetheless a highly undrerrated record. There were no hits from this album, but it nonetheless has 8 great songs. Indeed, there is the distorted guitar riff in ""I Think I Could Stand You Forever"" which is just slightly reminiscent of grunge rock (ten years later), and ""English Eyes"" truly is a fascinating song. ""If It's the Last Night"" is a nice ballad that should have been a hit single. Overall, a very good album."
4,hidden gem,"this recording before ""iv"" is overlooked but very good. there is some classic toto rock here"
5,What's not to like,Great CD. I had forgotten all about it and why some (or all of these songs) aren't on the Essentials CD is beyond me. Great band. I even have a 16 year old now who is listening to their stuff. I don't have this CD (had the album) but I am fixing to. A must if you are a Toto fan.
3,Un album à part...,"Le troisième album du groupe prend un virage plus rock que pour les précédents.Le succès de Turn Back se fera au Japon.Aux états-unis et en Europe le succès est bancal.Mme "" Goodbye Eléanor "" ne viendra pas à bout des apathiques programmeurs radio.L'album n'est pas du got des Fans et déoit quelque peu...Best : English Eyes, Gift with a golden Gun.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
4,rewarding,"I am now not only relieved of not always doing the cooking, but actually thoroughly enjoying the whole experience. Dinners at my boyfriends are now such a joy, the food is great and the reference are very amusing. So glad someone finally made dinner making is easy, fun and rewarding.I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoy my new beverage of choice. Made from 100% organic soy, taste just like coffee and no caffeine.Finally, I got rid of that wired up feeling all day and feeling great. Look for it on the net by googling ""s o yfee"".these dudes actually have good taste in music. i really can't believe they did this. a truly unique book"
2,Good product but needs to be built better,"I won't go into the roasting details - other reviewers have covered this very well.This is the 3rd iRoast I've owned. Although the do a good job roasting, they seem to last less then 2 years before something goes wrong with them. This time the glass has broken at the top of it."
1,Top broke after about 20 uses,"This little machine does a good job, until the top ring breaks and starts spewing chaff and smoke out the side. I am calling in for warranty work tomorrow (their office is closed now). In retrospect, I should have bought something a bit more sturdy and not so cheaply made. I hope this helps the next person not get a defective product."
1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"DON'T BUY THIS or any Hearthwear product. My i-roast lasted less than a year with regular weekly use. When it quit heating (burnt out) I was worried that because I didn't have the reciept due to it being a gift that Hearthwear wouldn't honor the waranty. Not to worry, you can't get serviec at all, let alone under waranty.I emailed Hearthwear repeatedly as stated in the waranty and called repeatedly and was unable to get an answer or leave a message due to the box being full. Bottom line, if you buy their products you're on your own!"
2,Don't buy it!,"Save your money and don't get an IRoast, also known as an IRoar. It is so loud that it is impossible to hear first crack.It is so loud that you can't hear anything. If you tell me you hear second crack you aren't telling the truth. You can't use color as a guide, as oils may come out after sitting a day. The only way to use this is recording in a journal and using trial and error. I put mine on eBay and got a Behmor 1600 and am happy."
1,Two in a row fail.,"My employer got this for me for christmas, It lasted about 15 months and then the blower failed. It runs and then just shuts down for no reason, I believe the heating element is still running but the blower isn't blowing. Good fire hazard..Anyway I bought another one in april, it is now december 1st. Exact same failure! I use it probably three or four times a week. After reading the other reviews here I'm pretty discouraged with trying to get them to honor my warranty..I will try anyway."
2,Programming took some tweaking; machine lasted exactly 1 year,"One year warranty, and the machine quite literally quit working on the 366th day. While it worked, it produced some good roasts. However, the programming took some getting used to, and constant tweaking and adjusting. Roasting was never very consistent, with a roasting profile producing a good 'city roast' on a particular varietal one time, and barely browning the same beans the next.For the money, I've decided to stick to hot-air popcorn poppers, which last anywhere from 6 months to over a year, at about 5% of the cost of this machine.While generally I would say that a machine that you can program, fill, start and walk away from is a real plus, this one was never consistent enough for this; you still have to keep an eye on it or risk underdone or scorched beans."
5,Who knew it would be this easy?,"Just got an iRoast2 recently as a gift from my spouse and tried it on some raw beans I bought at a plantation in Kona.Wow! I had no idea that roasting your own could be this easy and economical. You fill the carafe with a cup full of beans, plug it in, hit a preset program button, hit roast, and 15 minutes later you've got enough fresh roasted coffee beans to drink yourself into a coffee stupor. The process is very similar to popping pop-corn and just as easy.It gets better, from what I read on the web the real art is coming up with your own custom programs to tweak the goodness out of the beans. Another hobby! Plenty of web-sites to turn you into a professional coffee geek.By the way, the manual is available in pdf on-line so you can load it onto your Kindle."
2,Works great for about six months!,"I used my iRoast 2 about twice a week. After two months the painted labels for the buttons began to disappear. It took me a few months to determine my favorite roasting curves. The greatest part about this product is the flexibility to program your own roasting curves. The poor quality of the product gives it about 9-12 months of life. After that your lucky(and careful). I went back to zach & dani's as it is smoke free and a little cheaper(although only good for a year as well). This roaster looks cool and is fun to program(geeky), but not worth the high price. If this was about $50, I would give it 5 stars and be buying a new one every 6 months."
1,Bad customer service,I bought an iRoast for Christmas last year and it worked fine for a couple of months. Then it started going berserk and the only way to control it was to unplug it. I attempted to contact the manufacturer several times and never received any kind of response. I believe that this appliance is a safety hazard and would never recommend it to anyone. The lack of a response from the manufacturer says a lot.
2,Not built to last,"I liked this unit at first, even though it is horribly noisy. But after just over a year, it began to stop midway through the roasting process. If you aren't around when that happens, because there is no cool-down cycle, you could have a roaster fire. I watch mine like a hawk, and unplug it and restart it after it stops until I finally get my beans roasted, then I manually start the cool-down cycle. For $180 this machine should last more than a year. This is the second brand of roaster I have tried; I had two Fresh Roast units that also gave out after just one year. I am done with home roasting - as soon as I finish off my last bag of green beans, I am throwing this piece of junk away."
1,Junky construction. Plastic broke immediately. Worthless.,"I opened the box and looked at the assembly to find that the plastic is very cheap. There are some ""twist to lock"" features to the unit. I twisted with very little pressure and was not able to lock the unit. When I examined why, it looked like there were flaws in construction that blocked the locking mechanism. So...I applied a tad more pressure and broke the whole plastic casing. It was very little overall pressure. Just enough to try to turn the thing. Yep. Broken. What a piece of junk."
4,My first Thea Devine read,"Having never read Thea Devine before, I didn't know what to expect - and couldn't help but compare this author to my other favorites: Brenda Joyce, Virginia Henley, Susan Johnson, Laura Kinsale, etc. The relationship between the two characters was strange and seemingly impersonal, until you got to the amazing intimacy that they only shared behind facades of fake names and forbidden houses of pleasure. This was a very interesting way to see the main characters interact, but although its extremely erotic, I wouldn't call it ""romance"". Its definitely hot enough to keep your attention throughout the entire book, but you must wait until the very end to find any real emotional connection between the characters. This was a little disheartening to me. However, I will definitely pursue more of Ms. Devine's writing, and hope to see a deeper connection between characters than just amazing sex."
2,"No romance, just erotica","I found myself really bored with this book. The characters seem to have no emotional attachment to each other at all, and there is very little plot. Neither the hero nor the heroine have any appeal for me at all. The only reason I give the book 2 stars is because I did stay around long enough to find out who the killer really was, so although I was bored I did finish the book which I can't say about every book I've read. This book needs a lot more story and character development before I can rank it any higher than this... This book is a reprint of a book published in 1995."
4,Secret Pleasures,There is a good story plot if you like murder mysterys. Probably most people do not read erotica for a mystery. Throughout part of the book there was WAY too much sex. It just went on and on and nothing else. It has some rather sick characters and overall there was no love between the sex partners. The ending is rreal strange. But I would recommend.
4,Excellent CD Set..,"I enjoy listening to these CDs. The voices in the choir are excellent and, just like my church choir, they sing all of the songs. I'm not looking for vocal variety, I just want to hear these wonderful songs again. I recommend this set to anyone looking for those classic feel-good hymns from childhood!"
1,Road Rage,"All I can say is don't listen to these CD's while driving in heavy traffic. You don't want to be trapped in a car with THE SOPRANO. At some point someone should have said, ""OK Doris, back away from the Mic and let someone else have a chance."" Maybe she's married to the producer. And let's talk about the automated-percussion. I don't know about you, but I don't really think ""I Love to Tell the Story"" needs a lot of cymbals, but that's just me. I came to anticipate each and every cymbal crash, and I was not disappointed. Amazon should put this in the 2 for $5.99 bin. Makes this Lutheran girl long for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
1,Great on quantity small on quality,If you like traditional hymns and the majectic Mormon Tabernacle Choir sound. This is not it.
4,Excellent Album of Christian Hymns!,"This is one of the best music albums I've found! About 2/3 of the songs on this CD are sung with simple organ or piano accompaniment, and the choir members sing the songs well too. This CD has been a blessing to my family, friends, and myself. About 1/3 of the songs though, do have a more modern beat and I don't like them (that why it gets only 4 stars), but there's still about 65 songs on the CD that are great. If you enjoy singing hymns at church from your hymnal, like I do, then you'll probably really like this CD."
1,first movie I've ever reviewed,"This is one of the worst movies we've ever watched. It was slow, very badly acted and the plot, what there was of one, didn't flow at all. Nice premise for a chick flick but didn't come close. Don't waste your time. There are so many great movies to watch instead."
1,Pathetic,"I picked this movie from the video store under ""Western"". First off, this movie is definitely not a western movie, but that's not what bothered me most about it. Terrible acting, bad storyline, irrelevant scenes... that's what I didn't like. As far as love sotries go, this is one of the worst ones I've witnessed. I was planning to watch it with my boyfriend, but decided I would preview it first to make sure it was worth watching... good thing I did, because it would not have gone over well. Definitely not recommended."
2,Who is singing DREAM WOMAN in this movie??,"I was not overly impressed with the movie, but would love to know who sings the song DREAM WOMAN in the movie..all I have been able to find is Robert J Walsh, but think he wrote the song, not performed it.Anyone know who sings it in the movie??"
1,Only the 2nd movie I've ever bought and thrown away!!,"I don't even have words to describe how truly BAD this movie is! It wanders aimlessly, has no discernable plot, was directed by a 13-year-old, edited by his 11-year-old kid brother and makes absolutely no sense- on ANY level! I love old movies, new movies, classic movies and contemporary movies. I love chick flicks and war movies. I love romantic comedies and sci-fi. From Fred Astaire to Adam Sandler, from Kathryn Hepburn to Madonna- I LOVE great films. My wife and I agreed after STRUGGLING through 45-minutes of this nightmare: THROW IT AWAY!!"
4,Cowboys and Angels video - video review,I watched this movie with my family and we all thought it was quite funny and thought provoking plus I liked the romantic side of things.
1,Lamest movie I have ever seen! NOT a family movie!,"This is definitely NOT a family movie. Lots of weddings but also lots of infidelity going on and the ""cowboy"" falls in love - telling 3 different women he loves them in a short period of time. I just didn't get it.I mean, I got that the sick lady was an angel and that at the very end she says she didn't come for HIM and insinuated that she came for her girlfriend but how is that possible???? That she could be the best friend with an angel and know nothing about her. I didn't like this movie and I usually like anything I watch. This movie made no sense including the title. The main male character wasn't even a cowboy although he did own a few hats. Strange, waste of time, waste of money."
5,Great Romantic and Inspirational Movie -Worth Watching!,Great movie now one of my favorites and reading the other reviews on this one talked me into buying it and I was not disappoint so thanks to all who shared their comments! I movie worth watching and at a great price too!
2,"Good idea, bad execution.","There is poor character development, bad acting and same cliche ideas. The main guy falls in love with one woman, then with another, while at the same time still pining after his ex fiance who dumped him at the altar. The 2nd woman he falls in love with has the same cliche mentality about romance and relationships (there is only 1 person in the world for everyone), but somehow the writters thought the audience will buy into that highschool mentality. I wasn't convinced with Danny being truely in love with Candice because he was just to eager to leave her for JoJo then suddenly he had a revelation that he is in love with Candice and not JoJo. Sounds like the man needs to be alone for a while to sort out his personal issues instead of throwing himself into relationships."
3,3 1/2 Out of 5,"Enlow's sophomore album, The Recovery, is a combination of post-hardcore riffs with slight touches of melody. This album sounds like what This Day Forward might have sounded like had they combined the sound of In Response with The Transient Effects of Light on the Water. While not quite as good as either of those albums, this album has its moments. The band showcases a little of its metal influence in the same way that Mercury Switch does. In fact, the growling on this album is similar to that of an Indianola band. Joel Holmes, the singer, has a very similar singing style to that of Gary from TDF, a speaking/singing style that slides effortlessly in and out of growls. If you are into the early post-hardcore sound that This Day Forward spearheaded, check this CD out! For fans of This Day Forward, Mercury Switch, Across Five Aprils"
5,A useful book,Synthetic chemists honestly need this book. Very helpful as a good reference book for the applications of named reactions. This book will forever be relevant.
5,strategic Applications of Named reactions in Organic synthesis by KURTI & CZAKO,This book is nicely illustrated. The mechanisms of named reactions are depicted in colors for easy understanding by the user.This will be a very good book for the beginners in chemistry as well for the practising chemists.The industrial & academic examples choosen for the name reactions will give an indepth knowledge of the utility of the reactions. Overall I rate this book as a good companion for an organic chemist.
3,Not really see through,"I wanted these to put on our glass shower doors, but was disappointed because they aren't really double sided. the ""sticky"" side is kind of translucent, so you see a faded image from the other way. The stick and reposition well and the ""right"" side is very colorful and bright."
1,Failure,The adhesive on these cling pieces was so weak they did not even stick to the wall for a scant twenty four hours. A complete dissapointment.
4,A key component to this movie is the consumption of alcohol,"I happened to like skinned deep. I watched it right after Dead Alive, a really great Peter Jackson zombie film, and even then i could appreciate it. For those of you who don't like to drink during movies, or who are underage, this may not be for you. However, if one gets fairly smashed during this movie, and doesn't expect anything of a masterpiece, it should be just fine. It's really a unique and very weird movie. By the end of the film (and a 12 pack) you should be shaking your fist with enthusiasm at every point."
1,100 % CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What can I say about this movie but Don't Buy it or rent it! I did rent this movie and I feel so rip off! I would go into the story line but it doen't have one. I like bad movies but this offers nothing. I can not believe Fangoria even put it's name on the box. If any one tells you to buy or rent this CRAP they must be the makers of this CRAP! If any body gives this more than one star I think they need Help! Do yourself a favor and just move along. PLease!!!!!
5,Truly Excellent !!,"I really wonder whether the viewers who rated this movie 2 stars or less are true horror fans. This movie reminds me of the hilarious and gore elements of Bad taste or Dead Alive. Man, does this movie rock. And since when do we have to take horror movies serious? It all comes down to one thing: how much entertaining was it afterwards. I tell you, on a level of fun and gore, this movie will be extremely difficult to beat. Very well done Gabriel, an oscar for your directing.alex smit"
1,Skinned Deep Review,"This Horror movie stinks!!! It's nothing more then a cheesy Texas Chainsaw Massacre ripoff. The cast is bland & forgettable. The acting is fifth-rate. The dialogue is lame and weak at best. While it doesn't shy away from the blood & gore,most of the killings are pointless. The plot makes little to no sense. The only cool factor in this ripoff is Warwick Davis aka The Leprechaun but he fails to help the film in the long run. The most annoying part of the film is the end credits becuase instead of music,we get 4 minutes of a girl screaming ""NO NO"" over & over again. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."
1,And the Raspberry Award for the Worst Movie goes to...,"Well, maybe not the worst, but pretty close. The acting is certainly a candidate for most deplorable, since it is pretty bad. And the filming and plot is incredibly poor even by Fangoria's standards. Overall I was gravely disappointed in this flick, expecting much more than atrocious acting (with the exception of Warwick Davis)and cheap cinematography. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,This movie sucks so bad that I can barely explain.,"Bad story based on a bad plot that's already been re-hashed a thousand times before. Bad actors. Bad dialogue. Bad direction. Bad production. Bad effects. Bad costume design. Bad set design. Not even good in that bad b-movie sort of way, or even in a juvenile ""my kids made this for their high school project"" sort of way. Nope. Nothing. If you really feel like being cruel and want to laugh at someone's complete failure, then I guess you might have reason to watch this movie.To top it off, in the behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD, Willow/Wicket describes the what's-his-name director as genious. The whole thing is a self-admiring plummet into empathetic emarrassment. If this movie is good, then why are there 50 used copies for sale at Amazon for less than what you can rent it for?Oh, and dude needs to shave the pubes and get on an enzyte routine or something."
1,DONT BE FOOLED LIKE I WAS INTO BUYING IT,i bought it when i saw the 4 star rating...but i was fooled big time...totally fooled...This movie sucks...and i am a horror movies fan..but this one...is utterly bad that i was really embarressed since it was movie night at my house and i always show the best..this one was too bad that i tried very hard to come up with anything ..anything plausiable abt it..but nothing..absoultly nothing was!!! I hate it and wouldnt even recommend anyone watching it for free!!
2,SAAAAAY CHEEESE!!!,"The film is designed to be campy and cheesy, creating unbelievable characters. The acting was held to a minimum. The film includes the family of psycho killers, the ominous killer pick-up truck, hook tossing, head explosions, and a plate throwing midget. As a campy production it starts out well, but when it came down to where the love story of aspect of Brain and his prisoner Tina had to carry the film, it died. They attempted to create a surreal atmosphere, but only went half way.The film some good campy/cheesy scenes, but I just wasn't stoned enough to enjoy the whole film.F-bombs, no sex, male nudity (Jason Dugre)."
2,"Great story, terrible edition","I read this series a long time ago, and was very exited to finally see Kindle versions of the books, so I could re-read them.As many other reiewers have said, this edition needs a serious edit. The Kindle version is clearly an OCR scan of some printed edition, and the most basic of human edits would have caught all of the typos.The pubIsher really need sto fix this fundamental problem with the Kindle edition."
1,"Amazon, proofread these!! Book has too many typo's.","I love this series, and have read this book in paper format as well. The first two books of this series had relatively few typo/errors in the Kindle editions, but this one is embarrassing. Even spell-check would catch hundreds of errors, but beyond the obvious ones, there are plenty of errant letters that change the meaning if you don't know the way the words are really written. Of course ""tore"" is ""torc,"" but also -- Dougal isn't crying out, ""By the mane of Asian!"" -- it's ""Aslan."" The firvulag are ""wild,"" not ""wdd"". I wish I could correct or mark the errors myself, for them to be fixed... it's so frustrating. I can't imagine buying another Kindle version in this series... no one is proofreading these books. $10 not well spent."
1,$$$s over duty,"This story is intricate and demanding to read. Keeping track of all the characters is a challenge. But the story is worth it. Its taken 30 years for people to get the message.Unfortunately, the publisher must have used non-native English editors. Even academic texts suffer from this these days."
1,"Excellent story, horrible editing","As others have noted, the editing in this book is just terrible. The errors are on nearly every page. Some examples: ""all"" comes out as ""ad"", ""torc"" is ""tore"", and more subtly ""we'll, he'll"" is ""we'd, he'd."" The reader has to stop and 'translate' all the mistakes into what was probably the intended text. It's hard to believe that any publisher could mess the text up this badly. Consider that many books self-published for the Kindle are cheaper and have better quality control. For example, the SciFi-Horror series ""Wool"" is cheaper and nearly flawless.It's a terrible pity because the Pliocene story is great."
1,Shame on publisher!,"I hate giving this book 1 star, because it deserves 5. Heck, it deserves 10. The book is a classic.But, the incredible number of spelling (most egregious of which is ""tore"" over and over again for ""torc"") and punctuation errors (many periods are absent) make it painful to read. Obviously the publisher just automated the process of character recognition, then gave the result to Amazon to feel WITHOUT A SINGLE MINUTE OF QUALITY CONTROL. If a human being had spend a single minute looking at this book, they would have realized how many errors it had.Thank you, Julian May, for writing an excellent book.Shame on you, publishers, for having no quality control whatsoever."
4,It's a mixed bag.,"The story itself is great. I had read the paperback version 5-6 times but I wanted it on my Kindle Fire. It was rather aggravating to read the Kindle version because of the excessive typo's! I mean seriously, PROOFREAD!!! And while you're at it, SPELL CHECK!! The book itself I give 4 stars. The Kindle version 2."
2,"Wonderful book, ruined by an appalling digitisation process.","I should have read the reviews first! In my enthusiasm of finding the Golden Torc series on Kindle, I went ahead and bought them all at once.The first 2 books were marred by occasional transcription errors, but not so many as to spoil the experience. Not so with this one!In have really tried to get over the constant misspellings created by a very poor OCR product, and without any perceptible quality control, but when they are so frequent and of core words too, it's impossible.This has detracted to such an extent that the joy of re-reading a much loved classic in Kindle format has become an irritant.Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to go on without rectification. Others have previously commented on this and you have done nothing about it. Do you actually read the product reviews?Bottom line, overpriced for such shoddy quality. Please sort it out."
1,Wait for them to fix the Kindle format issues,"This review applies to the Kindle edition ONLY.The third book in one of the best science fiction series I've ever read, but until they fix the formatting issues, do not buy this book for Kindle. My apologies to Julian May for this review.They pulled the book from Amazon for a bit, and then it reappeared, so I figured they had fixed the formatting issues that everyone was complaining about. I was wrong. I bought it, started reading, stumbled across a few things, and then more. Here's an example:""The invading operants made their way to the Atlantic Coast. There they 40 THE NONBORN KING linked their modular ATVs to form boats...""I made it about a tenth of the way through the book before I found the mistakes too distracting to continue. I asked for a refund.To the publisher: Please hire an actual proofreader before you put this out for sale."
3,"How appalling, for the publisher to ruin a great book","The story is fantastic, but I should have read the other reviews. The problem has not been fixed and it needs to be. I am actually going to to attempt to contact the publisher, because it is appalling what they have done. Scanning, obviously using an OCR program, is fine. But for pete's sake, PROOFREAD!!!!!"
2,for shame,"This is one of my all time favorite series. It is absolutely shamefull what the publisher has done (or not done) to this digital copy.Clearly, no one bothered to even read through it once, as the transfer errors are so numerous they make certain passages almost unreadable. if you were reading this story for the first time, you would have no hope of following along. I expect this when the book costs $0.99, not $10. These money grubbers should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Time and Space - Lost,"Leon Russell is the undisputed master of time and space, creating a pure legacy of concert magic. Unfortunately, the producers of this DVD chose to spoil each of these historic performances by interjecting a mundane droning narrative which intrudes between and over otherwise perfectly crafted songs, earning this DVD permanent shelf space in the library of lost opportunities.."
2,Hard to Read harder to Believe,"Fidel Castro Lover of Humanity? This book is a poor excuse for a bad propaganda piece. Castro rails at capitalism but refuses to point the finger at the real culprit of Cuba's economic demise (himself). Only some lunatic and blind socialist could read this book without bending over from laughter or being totally revolted. Those who still believe Castro' or his revolution are anything but an abject failure or a crime against humanity will undoubtedly enjoy this trash. His statistics are not independently corrobarated, but that won't matter to any good socialist."
5,Great French Compilation CD,I LOVE THIS CD! It's an excellent sample of classic and modern French music. This is a very upbeat and jazzy collection of songs and brightens my mood when I listen to it. It is an excellent addition to your music collection that introduces you to some great French musicians. I will definately be buying more Putumayo CDs.
2,oh boy,"I like the french language, but only when it is sang by a woman. This album is good but some singles just arent that great."
4,french cafe,"this album has a certain quiality, je ne sais quois sort of thing... crack open a bottle of red wine, get the grapes cheese, pears, olives and baguette and go for it."
3,nothing special,This cd didn't do much for me...there's only a couple songs on the entire cd that i enjoy...i skip through the rest of them (they are just goofy).
4,A Great Collection!,"Another great album from Putumayo. They sure know how to put together the best world themed compilations! This one is another winner. This collection has the modern artists like Coralie Clement and Paris Combo with the classics like Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot. I especially love Ondule by Mathieu Boogaerts. It's a fun, poppy tune. Check it out!www.beatzblog.com"
4,A good relaxing and romantic CD,"If you want to relax and sip on a good cup of coffee / tea on a Sunday afternoon, this is a good choice."
2,Elevator music,"I read, write, speak, and understand French. Don't waste your time trying to find the English words to these songs on the net. It isn""t worth the effort, just relax in the mood of the French. (French lyrics are available on the net, but if you don't already know French, why bother looking?)It has been afew years since I've been back, but if this is the current state of French cafe music, I'm surprised more French people don""t eat/drink at home.Nicely produced. Good sound. Worth a one time listen through.Then after that, save the disk for low level background muzak for those times when you're entertaining, and trying to sound more sophisticated than you are. Light Mozart or Vivaldi would serve the same purpose, possibly improve your intelligence, and actually give people something to listen to during lulls in the conversation."
2,Dunebuggies,"The book arrived okay. I was disappointed that it did not have more of what i wanted to see in it, but I was satisfied witht the purchase however."
5,British Detectives from the North,"This is a continuation of the series about how cops are in the north of England. The series is great. The later seasons are not based on the books by R. Hill but on the characters he created, the production company has done a good job. I have purchased several seasons and like them all. The actors are well chosen. Shipping was right on target."
2,Warning! Re-Release Under a New Name,"I have now bought this dog twice. It is a repackaged re-release ofHow to Make Money Playing Texas Hold'em Poker(2006). Look there for the bad reviews.If you are a beginner, then save your money and buy the Vince Van Patten DVDs.If you are more advanced, look elsewhere.Just my two pence..."
2,Not too happy with this,Well I will say that this has ALOT of songs on it BUT the fact that hardly ANY of them sound like the tradtional songs just bugged me. You cant get a 3 or 4 yr old up to the mic (evn if it is sing along) & expect them to sing itsy bitsy spider when the music doesnt sound anything like what theyve learned in all of the nursery rhymes. Just my opinion. I wish Id seen a review like this myself. Thanks
5,Very Uplifting!!!,"I just ordered this CD (Hymns in the Garden) after hearing a sample of it in our local Christian Bookstore. I couldn't buy it in the store because it was discontinued so I was told to come to Amazon and to my surprise, I saw it. It only took 4 days to receive my CD in the mail and grant it, there was a scratch on the cover of the CD, the CD itself was in very good condition. I am listening to it right now and the songs that Kirk played were so uplifting. Thanks Amazon. Thanks Kirk!!!!"
5,Kirk Whalum Delivers !,If you love hymns and jazz this is the CD for you. Kirk gives stirring reditions of classic hymns with out sounding canned or predictable. His love for the Sacred is evident in his heart felt renderings.
2,"Well, the cover is pretty, anyway...","I bought this CD because the cover art was so pretty. It shows a castle superimposed over a holiday ornament, and the CD has the same design on it. When I played it, I quickly realized that this is NOT celtic music....it's very slow, dreary-sounding synthesised instrumentals, useful for putting yourself and all pets in the vicinity into a light fog. All four of my parakeets went to sleep, and my pomeranian passed out. Beware! Do not listen to while operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery."
1,very bad,"I'm an avid lover of Celtic Music, but this is not celtic music. Everthing is slow and almost sounds the same. All instrumentation is the same. No variety - painful."
5,a celtic christmas a seasonal tale,excellent instrumental - focusing on flutes. traditional christmas songs.
5,Canine charm,"An absolute gem of a book, packed with charm and thought-provoking ideas. Would make a wonderful gift for any dog-lover."
1,"Lot's of good dog books, but not here","I've read many, many good dog books. After reading this one I can say without reservation that this is not one of them. It's formula based and predictible and poorly written. Seems like I've seen a lot of this ""stuff"" before.If you love good writing and dogs and books about dogs don't crack this book. Don't make me say I told you so. Yuk!"
5,A Must Read!,"I have been in dog rescue for 2 years now and believe this book is an eye opener for the general public and therefore is a must read. The majority of people are not exposed to what effects there choices, good or bad have on there pets, they don't see the repercussions of their actions. This book gives them no choice but to wake up and take notice. There are some very touching stories of pets and their humans in this book, but Mr. Katz does not sugar coat the harsh realities either, and for that I applaud him. If only more people would read this book, maybe one day our shelters would be empty of dogs, who were only being dogs, and could not live up to the unreal expectations that we as humans place upon them."
3,Good ride on,We bought this for our son when he was 12 months and he didn't really care about it. Now that he is almost 2 it seems to be a favorite toy. We were about to put it up in the attic when he decided he loved it. Nothing fancy about this ride on but it is sturdy and can be used outside as well as in.
3,"Rusty, Rusty, Rusty","I love Kershaw knives, the speed opening feature has got to be the best thing going.This knife is a tad heavy for me, I like to keep it clipped to my pocket, and it just seems a little heavy. I don't blame Kershaw for this, it is my own fault not checking the size with my other knife...The one problem is it rusts really fast. The blade tarnished within a couple weeks of use. No problem, just use a little steel wool and it comes right off. But, I would rather not have to mess with it.It is a guality knife, just heavy.I have relugated it to my toolbox and bought a smaller knife."
5,happy customer,"This was bought for my mom to give to her great grandson, everything was fine except the case was cracked in several places, the company refunded me my purchase price for the inconvenience of the case. I was happy with the company otherwise."
3,This is not a CHRISTY Lane CD!,"I am writing these comments only because this posting for this album by Cristy Lane (the country and gospel singer) appears under the listings for Christy Lane (most of whose CDs contain party dance music). Amazon often mixes up the album listings for Cristy Lane and Christy Lane.The excellent CD entitled ""Footprints in the Sand"" is by CRISTY Lane, and a full listing of sellers of that album can be found separately on the Amazon site under the listings for Cristy Lane. This CD is undoubtedly being erroneously posted here under the listings for CHRISTY Lane (the dancer), along with Christy Lane's party dance music, because of a typographical error. To be safe, any prospective buyer wishing to purchase ""Footprints in the Sand"" should check with the sellers listed here to confirm what CD they're selling, and should also check the more extensive listing of sellers for the ""Footprints"" CD under Cristy Lane's listings."
5,A great read,"As a fan of beer and business, I found this book to be terrific for both. Steve and Tom are very good at relating their stories in both an entertaining and instructional way. I highly recommend this book, it was an inspiration for me."
5,Broad appeal,"Hindy and Potter begin as students and end up being inspirational teachers in Beer School. There are lessons for everyone in this book. I learned about entrepreneurship, partnership, and handling adversity. The authors share their personal trials and travails while imparting their business acumen and expertise. Beer School is immensely readable; I could not put it down. I plan to spread this wisdom by giving Beer School to many on my holiday gift list."
5,Great beer book read,"Often books on beer and brewing, even ones that deal with the business side of things or telling the larger story of the brewery can get tedious at times. Beer School stays interesting and easy to read for the entire length of the book, probably due to the fact that Steve Hindy had been writing for the associated press for so many years. I managed to tear through this book in about a week which is pretty quick for me. The book comes highly recommended for anybody looking to open a brewery, go pro, become self employed or is just interested in beer and brewing.[...]"
5,Inspiring and Educational Beer and Business Book,"I am just about done reading Beer School. Normally, I am only a reader at night, but I have found myself cracking it open at all hours to digest the next tidbit. This really isn't the type of subject matter I would typically pick up but I am glad I did. It is eye opening about the process that the authors/owners went through to build a successful brewery. For those of us that aspire to the American dream, this is a great validation of the possibilities. Even if you aren't into beer, this is a great, easy to read book on building a successful enterprise. The fact that I love beer made it that much more enjoyable. I find myself evaluating beers, breweries, distribution, marketing, and beer pubs in a different light because of the Brooklyn Brewery."
4,This book would be better if there were free samples inside,"This is an interesting look at the stories and tribulations of starting a business. Even if you don't care much for the entreprenuerial side of the book, its still about beer, how can it be bad? The writing is clear and personal, what you would expect from an experienced story teller who loves his work. Brooklyn Brewery has a unique corporate culture in which the reader feels he is a part. I already have plans forming in my head to start homebrewing, Steve and Tom's overwhelming success make it sound easy. Definately pick up beer school, its entertaining and you might learn something too."
2,Maybe the wrong guy wrote it?,"As enjoyable and informative as it is, it's kinda hard work. There's 2 people involved, a banker and a writer/homebrewer from a newspaper. The majority seems to be written by the banker which makes it a bit of a slog. Still many great lessons to learn, but maybe not as enjoyable as it could have been. I REALLY enjoy drinking their beers more than I do reading the book."
4,Entrepreneurship,This book does a good job of showing the highs an lows of starting a brewery. They balance the details with stories and trade off between the partners to keep it interesting. The authors do give themselves a little too much credit for starting the renewal of Brooklyn. It seems that most of their success was due to being in the right place at the right time and taking advantage of the opportunities that were present to them. Overall it is a good read but don't expect any hidden gems or a plan to start your own brewery.
3,This is a business book beer just happens to be their product,From an entertainment standpoint this book held my interest. I learned a lot of what not to do in starting a brewery. Their inflated egos cost them lots of money that could have been better spent when starting this business and when I got to the end of the book I don't feel they still understood that concept.If you are looking for information on how to start a successful brewery this isn't it. It is filled with stories and not information with the possible exception those chapters on branding and marketing. Those chapters have lots of good information about how they went about marketing their products.
4,Anyone in the beer business should read it,Simply Great ! it covers almost everything in the beer business with a realism and a great sense of humour.I wish we had more books like this for the industry
2,disappointed,I bought it believing that what I was getting is what the photo shows. in the box the mic came without the goose neck. now what do I do - go in search of a goose neck. very disappointing.
5,Wonderful Booki!,"I bought this book since my yoga teacher reads excerpts at the end of each yoga practice. The passages are short, profound thoughts that really give one's soul beautiful, kernels of wisdom and thought."
1,Flimsy at best,"I purchased these wheel chocks to keep my trailer in place on my driveway, which they actually do quite well as long as you also use the donut to stabilize the trailer jack wheel. Unfortunately I made the mistake of not removing them one day when I moved my unladen trailer with my truck. They provided nearly no resistance to the trailer and were completely flattened. My mistake, I know, but I didn't expect them to be destroyed. Now I'll be fabricating a set of chocks out of 3/16"" plate steel in my garage.I'll still use the donut."
5,Another Good Example of Aussie Pub Rock,"I saw the Divinyls in 1983 at Macquaire University and they blew the hall apart.I have not purchased a record by them until this one just recently.The band still sounds fresh and interesting even after so many years.The strong songs remain there early ones, Only Lonely particularly.If this band was around today and had access to the didgital recording technology the record would be even more impressive.Cannot recommend the album highly enough!"
3,The other side of Buster Poindexter,"If David Johansen had decided to become a 200+lb former porn-star instead of the lounge-lizard we all know and love as Buster Poindexter, he would have become Candye Kane. While this, her major-label debut, is not quite up to her first two albums, it still beats any of that CRAP that will be played on the radio at any given time of day!"
4,I Like It I Like It Allot,I have 3 other CDs by Candye and each one was the best. My daughter says it is a good one to clean house to her apt is now spotless. I have featured it on my radio show Blues Wave Radio 88.1/97.7 FM Sat 7 to 9 am in the East Bay CA. Also on Single's Cafe on Sun. 5 to 6 pm. G Hanes Where It's Red Hot & Resophonic Blue.
4,See this lady live!,"I had the pleasure of seeing Candye Kane in CA and NY, and those who have joined me for the evening are amazed by her presence. Go see her show, dance a little, then buy her other albums before going home. There are more of them not included here."
1,Buy No More,"So hard that husband couldn't even sleep and upsets me that its non refundable! Would Never buy again, waste of money!"
2,Nice piece of decoration for home!,"I wanted to get real with straight razor and shave propperly and with style... the thing is I bought this razor unknowing a lot of things about straight razors...1- its stainless steel which makes it really really hard to hone, if you can get it honed then it wont be as sharp ""my first shaving with it was torture!"" ...2- its pretty bad quality ""the weight is not well balanced""3- it wont shave you... get a DOVO! and first learn about straight razors... there is a web page called straightrazorplace ask around dont get disappointed like me!"
1,This is NOT a razor!,"Kriegar does not make razors, they make cheap knives. The edge on this blade is unacceptable for shaving, and cannot be honed. I would recommend this products as an interesting letter-opener, but certainly not as a shaver. Don't waste your money."
2,A bit dissapointed,"this is a beautiful knife, but when i recieved it, it was very poorly sharpened, it didn't even cut any hairs off the underside of my arm without really scraping it hard. a strop and my soft stone were not enough to sharpen it, it needs to be taken back to the manufacturer to be recut. I was a bit dissapointed."
2,Cheap,Razor feels cheap and does not hold an edge well. Blade was not ground straight at factory so it took a considerable amount of time on the water stones to get a workable edge. Not recommended.
1,Pay for what you get,This product is what it is described as a knife that is a razor look alike. Not intended to be used for shaving there was no information about shaving or being efficient for shaving. I wish I would have done research on straight razors and spent the right amount of money on a good razor because they will usually last a life time. With that said I think I will sharpen the knife and use it as a envelope opener.
3,should of listin to the reviews,i honed for hours and it just cant keep a edge ... too bad its a really nice handle and would of loved to shave with it
1,This item is not for shaving.,This item could be used as a knife and nothing else. I am very unhappy with this purchase. This straight razor is dull and would have to be professionally honed or re-cut.
2,This razor,"This razor does look nice but I feel as if that is all it does. When it came to me in the mail, I had to sharpen the edge and hone it because it was not sharpened. When I did get a nice edge, and finally used it it would not hold the edge worth anything. In my opinion you are better off using this money on a better made blade with a harder steel. Also I would not recommend a new user on getting this one because they will have a miserable experience."
1,great price...POS blade,"I'm a novice when it comes to straight razors, but even I know a razor isn't supposed to weigh as heavy as a brick. The price is good but the razor isn't worth it. Do yourself a favor and buy a restored antique blade or if you wanna fork over 80 bucks or so for a DOVO. Since buying this blade, which has terrible balance and an awkward handle, I went and bough 3 other antique razors. I personally sharpened, honed and stropped each one and they are extremely sharp! so do yourself a favor, skip this china knockoff and buy yourself something worth while, after all it is your face."
1,kriegar razor,"Fake. Blade rotates more than 270 degrees with no resistance and is still hard to open. Blade is NOT ""razor quality."" Looks nice, doesn't cut, dangerous to user. Don't buy it!"
4,It's well worth the money.,"It is well worth the money. A nice product, no frills, but well made and it does take the hair off of the face."
3,Not what I was expecting,"The packaging is Great and looks nice, the time of delivery was good, I received the product before the estimated time. The thing that I don't like is , it does not have changeable blades, it is just like a knife but sharp knife and you have to sharpen it every time it dulls. others than that, It is Great. ( that is not what I was looking for)"
1,Not for shaving,"Great deal pricewise, but i took this item to get sharpened by a professional, and was still not able to get it sharp eneough to shave with. 10.00 worth of steel, it is a good novelty item or if you want to have something flashy to cut some string. Stropped and honed BY a professional... cant shave the hair of my chinny chin chin. DONT BUY IT TO SHAVE! I would have sent it back, but 10 bucks is a lesson, to do research before you buy."
3,Quality when you receive item!,"Kriegar Sharp Stainless Steel Straight RazorsThe product is a little high for pricing. The test results' are base on the following: Man (craftsmanship), machine (material), method (quality). Craftsmanship of product was of quality design by appearance test display, rating 89% overall totals. Material of product Stainless steel with magnified metal test show little quality differences between USA made rating of 72% ask of holding edge surfaces. Method of product quality rates a 25% sharpness, can be improve upon to meet sharpness qualities for use. Once re hone and sharpen razor edge put upon, edge held shaving standards for time fame use requirements. Indianapolis,IN U.S.A."
3,I want to know the country of origin when I purchase something.,"I paid $11.15 for this item, it id now $6.84. Had I known it was made in China, I would have purchased a different one at any cost!"
1,awfull,it is awfull wouldent even cut the thinish hair i had on my arm it is the worst knife ive ever bought
2,"looks pretty, but that's it","bought this a long while back, tried using it and couldn't get anywhere with it. It'll scrape at the hairs, but doesn't really cut em, ended up buying a different razor to do the job"
2,PEARLY BUT SQUIRRALY,"I was not to impressed with this KRIEGAR PEARL HANDLED KNIFE. This is a nice cheap tool, I wont use it on my husbands neck. If you collect this is great just not as an shaver. gg"
3,* FOR FANS AND COLLECTORS *,"This is a cd for the seasoned Prince Far I listener. Blood & Fire have collected super-duper-ultra rare Far I tracks, and cleaned them up beautifully. This disc shows a range of things, including a few dubs, many toasts, and a couple of things produced by Far I. However, this disc is not a good introduction to the prince, as it does not really contain any of his greatest toasts, but interesting, if not quite essential stuff for those of us who are already fans.Prince Far I discs for those just starting out? Well, there is ""Dubwise"" featuring many of the most amazing, trippy Far I dubs, as well as three of his absolute best toasts. As far as albums of just toasts, there are many, some of the best being ""Heavy Manners,"" ""UNDER Heavy Manners,"" and ""Long Life."" ""Health And Strength"" on Pressure Sounds is another good one, but is not on this site as of this writing.Happy listening."
4,Rum Not Included ;- ),"While perfect for field use, my Gerber EZout ATS34 is too large for most jobs around the office and home. So, I was in the market for a small but usable pocket knife and bought the Gerber Mini-Fast Draw - cheap product from China. I then bought the Ken Onion designed, Kershaw Scallion - very good feel, high USA quality, smooth action, and reasonably priced at $35, but wanting something classy... I went for the Mini Mojito (Mojo) and, knowing the high quality of Kershaw knives, just knew this would be a great knife. Did the research, and bought (2) Mini Mojo's from 888 knives R us. (The second one was a gift for my brother; he loves it.) This is an outstanding knife! Thin, smooth, precise, classy, very good grip.... only one draw back: while the pocket clip is reversible (Tip up or down), the leading edge/point is too shallow and requires a lttle effort to clip to my pocket... if you're frequently pulling the knife out, you'll probably find this annoying. Otherwise, a great buy!"
5,Best knife I've ever owned,"After owning this knife for a week, I can only say... wow. The quality, design and operation of this knife is virtually perfect. The size is great for an every day carrying knife. The speed safe mechanism works so well that the first time I tried it, my jaw literally dropped open in amazement. No joke! In a world of over-hype where almost nothing works as advertised, this knife is the nicest treat I've come across in quite a while. Great job Kershaw!"
5,Love this knife,This is a well built knife and worth the money. Opens easily and keeps it's edge. Well balanced and has a perfect weight for it's size. Two thumbs up on this blade.
1,Broke After Three Uses,I bought this and it broke after i hit it with a hammer 3 times. I do not reccomend this as hammer throwing target practice dummy as advertised.
3,Disappointment,"This program has a great variety of useful features. Yet, I found a glaring omission: There is not a single graphic or reference to PENTECOST, even though the rest of the seasons of the liturgical calendar are included. This is unexplainable for a software that claims to be Christian."
5,Great Tool for Christian Productions in the church,"I use this program to do my weekly church bulletins and any signs, handouts, posters, visitation flyers, and even door hangers for our youth visitations once a month in our community. With all the graphics in this program I am sure to find whatever graphic I may need for any church event or calendar. This program is a must for anyone who does the paperwork in their church such as those I have listed above. I would love to see more programs like this one available on the market at reasonable prices for those who can't afford the more expensive programs."
4,Infectious,I personally prefer other bands when it comes to my ska. But this is a nice addition to anyone's collection even just for the pop value of it. There are a lot of catchy and upbeat songs that will put you in a kind of happy and dance-y state of mind.
5,It's simply the best,"Reason why I bought this album and reason why you should ( as an hardcore English Beat fan or beginning fan ) is the fact that you have the song ""too nice to talk to "" on it. This was an non album single and worth it to buy an complete album for. Ofcourse there's loads of good songs on this compilation ( for beginning fan a good start ) Hard core fans will already have all three albums....unfortunatly without ""too nice to talk to""."
4,Great stuff -- but it CAN be beat,"This is more of a true greatest hits compilation than the original 1983 album ""What is Beat?"" For fans that already had all of the band's releases, ""What is Beat?"" was actually more interesting in its own way, since it contained unreleased and live tracks.This 15-track set does a pretty good job of showing the Beat's talents. The big radio hits are here. If a good overview is what you want, this is your album.If you want an album that beats this one, though, buy the Beat's debut, ""I Just Can't Stop It."" That one is a greatest hits compilation all by itself, and even some of its minor tracks slaughter songs like ""Doors of your Heart."" It's a crowning achievement, and they hit it on their first time out. Get that one first. Then you'll find yourself buying all three of the Beat's albums and you won't really NEED this one. Still pick up ""What is Beat?,"" though, for its rarities."
2,Bit dated - bot boring,Pretty boring and not very well produced ....needs more tactics and more info current stuff
3,good,i like this movie it is fast paced and you can get a good idea on tacics it is a paintball master movie.
5,15th century Spain comes alive!,"The Heretic is well written, entertaining and historically reminds us of a dark period in the history of Spain. The characters were real to me and I found that I was compelled to keep reading and finished the 370 pages in about 2 and a half days. I thoroughly enjoyed it and wished the story could have continued."
5,I`m buying this book as a gift for my friends to read.,Aside from the fact that the book is well written; Aside from the fact that the author did an extraordinary amount of research; Aside from the fact that you can learn so much history from this book; the story took on a life of such realism. You felt involved with every character. I recommend this book for every religion and denomination. There is so much to learn from the past. I hope Steven Speilberg reads this book and makes a movie.
3,dissapointed,"My family is nothing short of totally in love with the original Olivia book, but we were very dissapointed with Olivia Saves the Circus. The dialogue does not flow. I find the pull-out section in the middle frusterating. I loved the first book for it's simplicity. He appeals to the adult reader with humor, but captures the heart of the child with adorable illustrations and scenarios they too are familiar with. Something is just amiss in the second Olivia book - but I'm still keeping my fingers crossed for a third book."
5,Olivia is great,"My 3 year old loves the Olivia books. I recommend them all as they are even enjoyable for the parent to read over and over. I would like to comment on the reviewers who insist on telling in detail what the entire book is about. What is that all about? I thought we were to give our opinions, not retell the story."
2,Original is MUCH better,"This book teaches lying. It is not as good as the first.We will keep it because we like Olivia in general. But, like another reviewer, I feel as though I need to explain many of Olivia's behaviors to my child. (""Right now Olivia is pretending"", ""She should have told the teacher the truth"" and ""Olivia and her Mommy need to spend some time together talking"") I wish Mr.Falconer had been able to make these explinations for me...We are still holding out hope for the Olivia and Missing Toy."
4,Cute,"This book is cute, and the illustrations are adorable. I think it could have been a little longer, but it was still enjoyable.Olivia is a pig. Somewhat of a spoiled pig. It's her turn to show and tell at school, so she makes up a story about going to the circus, and all of the performers being out sick, so she has to take over for them and perform.This is an adorable book, and anyone who likes Eloise should enjoy it."
5,Olivia,This book is a lot of fun. I cannot wait to buy it and the sequals. I read it in a children't literature class and everyone else in the class liked it too. A lot of fun!
2,Not as good as hoped,"LOVED Olivia and the Missing Toy, wished I'd read Olivia Saves the Circus in a bookstore because I wouldn't have bought it. Very disappointed."
3,Not nearly as good as the original,"My daughter and I both adored the original Olivia. But this one is just not nearly as cute or as funny. It has none of the ""panache"" of the Olivia we've grown to love. Stick with the first book -- skip this one."
1,"Used, ""Very Good"" Book was ""Very Poor""","The cover of the book was in decent shape. Unfortantly, there were pages falling out and two pages had large creases in them. I don't understand how the seller could rate this book as in ""very good"" condition."
1,Worthless,"This book, as the other Olivia books, is witty and creative. Unfortunately, the book is rendered worthless and inappropriate by the poor content. Olivia lies. Yes, all children enjoy fantasy, but when she's directly asked for the truth, she lies. Again, most kids will try that at least once. But for Olivia, there are no consequenses. What an awful message for children.It gets worse. She shows a very negative attitude about her ""boring uniform"" that she has to wear to school. What a brat. And at the end she intentionally defies her mother, and of course, no consequenses. Blech. It's worthless, which is too bad because this author definately has talent."
4,Solid product,"This seemed like a big purchase at the time, almost one tenth of the cost of the camera itself. It was the best move I made since getting into digital photography.There's nothing like having a ""bottomless"" well into which you can dump your pictures and along with a high capacity battery, significantly changed the way I not only took digital photographs but also my photography on the whole. I heartily recommend that every digital photographer get a good high capacity card and the Viking has proven itself to be a good quality, reliable product. My only regret is seeing how far the price has dropped in a little less than a year."
4,Short drum life may be fixable,I own two of these drum units. I was disappointed that the drum was failing only after about 8000 prints. I found toner buildup on the drum cylinder. The problem was corrected by replacing the toner cartridge not the drum. Possibly it was defective toner cartridges causing premature drum failure.
1,Almost the cost of a new printer,"This drum goes VERY fast. Our office replaces 1 drum for every 2.5 toner cartridges for the HL5240 printer. So you're looking at getting maybe 18,000 prints per drum (even though it advertises 25,000). The price of a brand newBrother HL-5240 High-Speed Desktop Office Laser Printer, which comes with this drum and a toner cartridge, is actually almost the same price as buying the toner and drum separately. So anyone who needs a toner and drum at the same time should just buy the printer, since it's like getting a printer for free."
5,Excellent Deal!,"When I need a replacement part, or some other specialized supplies, I take the time to research before purchasing. This time was no exception. After checking about 8 other suppliers, I purchased from Amazon.com because they had the best overall price including shipping, and delivery is always fast. Thank you for the best value and service!"
1,NOT A BROTHER PRODUCT!!!,"I just received and installed this drum. While it seems to be working alright, this is not the promised Brother drum. It is a knockoff, which is not as it is sold here on Amazon. I bought this for work, and if it does not produce product as an original Brother drum I will be making a formal complaint.PLEASE CHANGE YOUR DESCRIPTION TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT!!"
1,Toner not included as indicated in product details.,"The product description makes it seem like there is a DR520 (drum) and a TN550 (toner). That is not the case. I only got a drum. With the generic versions costing 1/5 of the name-brand, I am incensed. I feel cheated."
3,Questionable OEM product,"The first drum arrived showed toner particles on the drum roller. Hence we called Amazon customer service to get a replacement. However, the replacement also showed the toner particles on the roller !! Are these refurbish drum unit? If yes, it should indicate on the description. I really would like to know the outcome of your investigation about this."
1,Very Disappointed,"After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25,000 yield capacity, on 12/11/06....Today 1/15/07 my printer is giving me the same error message ""DRUM NEAR END"" There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished..I certainly have NOT printed 25,000 copies..."
1,Piece of Junk,"I paid the extra bucks to get an official ""from the original vendor""TN-520 and have been furious since I got it. It lasted 2000 pagesand then quit, claiming the drum needed to be replaced yet again !!!Called Brother's Tech Support line, they walked me through how to reset itand said everything should be fine now. Printed another 5000 pagesand can visibly see ""scrape"" marks in the printing. Took theunit apart, and sure enough could see the area of the drum where it is scored.(And no it was not from the cartridges, they were all stock TN-580s).So, nothing like paying top dollar for a defective unit from the get go."
2,Brother OEM Problems,"I installed a new Brother OEM drum (DR-520) in my MFC-8870DW about 15 months ago, along with a new toner cartridge (TN-550)--again, Brother OEM. The drum is rated to last for 25000 copies. We are a low-volume office, so my total print volume in 15 months has been about 1500 pages. Still, the drum recently failed, resulting in horrible print quality. After a long conversation with Brother customer service, they told me that I should replace the drum. However, they would not agree to give me any type of adjustment or compensation. They told me the warranty on consumables is 90 days, period. But who is going to print 25000 pages in 90 days? So, they rate the drum for 25000 pages, but stop any type of warranty or adjustment period after only 90 days, regardless of how many pages have been printed or how premature the failure is. I would expect better. I guess Brother can consider me a dissatisfied customer..."
3,Brother DR520 - Replacement Drum Cartridge,Originally when I ordered this item I received an email with the shipping and tracking number information. By the last day of the estimated delivery date according to Amazon I called to check on the status because I hadn't received the item nor was the tracking information useful. After Toner4Sale did some research they told me it wasn't ever shipped. They immediately shipped another drum out and sent me a free shipping coupon code to redeem on my next purchase. They were very nice and apologetic with the whole situation and I do understand that things happen so overall I would recommend them to other people and order from them again.
5,Success,"I have recently read the Portuguese version of this book. It was my first contact with Feng Shui. I had once tried another book, but it got boring before I could get any useful information. Mr. Webster's book is easy to read and follow, has just the right amount of information to make you curious to learn more, and is a very nice way to spend some quality time. It is fun and interesting. After reading this book, I already bought two more books on the subject. I think that he never really intended for it to be the final word about that theme, but he surely shared some practical information. In my opinion, it fulfills its purpose and makes us more attentive to the flow of energy around us, and in all areas of our lives. My teenager children loved it too. And even checked their own rooms for things that could be disturbing harmony or cluttering corners. As a mom, I call that a success! And as a woman I say: encore! :)"
1,I had a good laugh!,"I had a good laugh reading this book. Now I finally know that if I and my partner split up, I will have to blame the overhead beams in our bedroom or the bed that is accessible only from one side, or the tiles in my bathroom, or...or...By putting the blame on factors other than ourselves, this kind of book offers us an alibi for the mistakes we make.I'm sure there is a way to live in harmony with mother Nature, ourselves, and our partners and friends but don't look for it in this book because you are not going to find it."
1,One Word: AWFUL,"This book is by far the worst of Henley's. Don't get me wrong, I love a good common-girl-rises-up-and-takes-the-nobility-by-the-... story, but this one fails. It only illustrates how mercenary (and apparently, rather promiscuous) Bess was. And Henley conveniently omits the later years of Bess' life, when she became the ... of England. It's common knowlegde that when she could not keep George Talbot from straying, she ruined innocent people's lives. Granted, Mary Queen of Scots was no nun, but Bess took advantage of her vunerability and ruined her further. This woman does not deserve to be remembered in the romantic way Henley portrayers her. She gives all women who have and do aspire to be more than they are a bad name."
5,"A Compelling ""Fictionalized"" Biography","In a word -WOW!!! Ms. Henley really out did herself. I was hesitant to purchase a novel catagorized as a ""Fictionalized Biography"" particularly when the heroine, Bess Hardwick, marries no less than four men! But Viginia Henley really pulls it off. This story is not your typical romance because it breaks the stereotype that the heroine can only have one true love.The most compelling of all is the fact that Bess Hardwick was a real person who lived during Elizabeth I's reign. She became the wealthiest women in England second only to the queen herself. Buy it in hardcover because your going to want to read it over and over."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This was a wonderful story in so far as it was an account of a person's life in the reign of Elizabeth I. In comparison to her other books though it lacked the spark that keeps the pages turning. I enjoyed Bess's triumph over any adversity that came her way, but I admit to becoming confused several times trying to remember who all the characters were and their relation to each other and Bess. All in all a good book, but I wasn't looking for a history lesson."
2,MIS-REPRESENTED,"I DID ENJOY THE BOOK, BUT IS TOO LONG AND DRAWN OUTFOR ME AND THE BLURP ON THE BACK COVER IS MISLEADING.I DID NOT FINISHED THIS READING THIS BOOK BECAUSE OFWHATS HAPPENS IN THE STORY, I DID NOT LIKE THE TURN OFEVENTS. IF YOU ARE GOING TO WRITE A BIOGRAPHY OF SOMEONE LIFE SAY SO,OTHERWISE IT WAS A WASTE OF MY PRECIOUSTIME."
2,"the ""heroine"" was sadly faulty...","to be frank, i found elizabeth a woman in heat (for lack of anything more polite to say). and greedy, too. she's like this because of what happened with her home but it isnt really a laudable trait, as u may well know. she enjoys leading men on. she flirts outrageously it verges on the offensive.george is simply a blind fool. handsome as the devil, sure. but i really dont see how he can fall in love with a woman who only accepted him to her body because he gave her gifts.what i can commend was that henley gave a rich story of what happened in queen elizabeth's court. some things were cleared up for me regarding the tudor family and the intrigues that went with it.it isnt a remarkable story. sure, the sex was great. but the romance? where was the romance, anyway?"
3,Okay book to read,"The book was okay to read, definitely not one of her best.It is hard to decide when to buy a book, the best way to determine is if you like the author."
1,"Lazy, disastrous disappointment","I can't imagine a less likeable heroine. Bess gets what she wants because she's beautiful and has great breasts- a fact which Henley comments on ad nauseum. Instead of coming across as independent and ambitious, Bess seems like a materialistic opportunist. Virginia, stop hitting us over the head with overwritten sex scenes and lewd banter and give us characters we can really care about. As a former fan, I know you have it in you."
1,Pure Caca,"I love Virginia Henley but this one was aweful!! This Bess woman got everywhere in life solely on the fact that she had huge breasts! Ugh! Call me old-fashioned, but I like a heroine with one main lover - not four for crying out loud! Nothing about this book impressed me. Sorry. Through it into the fireplace."
3,Long & drawn out...but good,"If you like explicit love scenes then this book is for you. The story is pretty much dominated by Elizabeth and her ambitions to ""climb the ladder of sucess"" and her sex starved nature. I would have loved to have learned more about The Earl of Shrewsbury and would have liked the story to have been more about Bess & Shrew's relationship. This book is great in it's detail to history but lacks in what makes a great historical romance."
1,misleading title,"I won't abound on what have already been said by one of the reviewers: ""pedestrian"" means ""non mathematician, very well versed on Quantum Theory"". But I liked to stress that this is not a book to learn Lie Group Theory from scratch. Far from that, I closed (and shelved) it at around page two."
1,What is this crud?,"Is Clint Eastwood, an actor Cowboy, Cop, Bronco Billy...yes, but this was non of those, This was unheard and weird jazz for goodness sake. Clint get a grip, you don't smoke ribs in East St. Louis. You are a cowboy!"
5,Do not know for PC BUT for Mac Environnement it's EXCELLENT,"I have been a graphic designer for almost 11 years, i am using Photoshop for alsmost some years now, and it's a very good software for designers and special effects, i have just baught a G4 MAC laptop 17"" and this standard Adobe CS2 (MAC) works perfectly on it also the illustrator, i did not use yet the other software that are on the cd's but these two so far until otherwise are excellent. This Adobe software works REALLY REALLY well on Mac, Well,... for me it does. that is woth the price beleive me, you can buy it with no fear.do not know yet for PC, but MAC users, trust me you can go for it."
3,"Kindle Version, Hard to read",I just downloaded the sample but I found myself struggling to read the symbols. Sometimes even after enlarging I couldn't read it.Just thought I'd point this out for any kindle users like myself.
4,Great for young adult readers!,"You'll be captivated from the first page when you read about Eddie sneaking out of the house to run away from his abusive step-dad. Eddie is 15 and now homeless, finding solace in the Calgary Zoo. While there he writes in his journal about his days and you get a great insight into this gentle and confused survivor. He befriends a middle-aged man who ends up saving his life in the end. I won't give the whole thing away but I read it before giving it to my 12 year old son and he read it in two days and loved it! Any book that can captivate a 12 year boy is a winner in my opinion. We're off to get more of David Poulsen's books and Last Sam's Cage is definately on a few of my Christmas lists to buy."
4,nice product,I have had this watch for about a month and it is rock solid. The watch is a little loud and won't win any beauty contest but if you need a rugged watch this one is it. No bells and whistles just a good dependable watch.
4,good basic outdoor watch,"I was wanting a basic, easily read analogue watch that can take a few knocks & bumps....and it does the job nicely :)"
2,Horrible! But looks nice!,I received the watch earlier then expected. But was sadly disappointed in the quality!I returned and bought a G-SHOCK. Never going back to anything else!!!!PRO.-Looks good-Feels good-Feels physically strong-Good customer serviceCON-Indiglo light was not lighting the whole watch face.-Have to reset date every month!!!-Seconds hand was not in sync!
1,What a disappointment,"I had owned a similar model of Timex watch for over 10 years that kept perfect time. It would still be going strong had it not been for an overzealous, yet utterly incompetent repairman's attempt to change the battery. At any rate, I bought this one new, sight unseen with full faith and trust in the Timex brand. Turns out that I should have done my homework, because after a few months I've started to have the same problem that a number of other reviewers have mentioned: the watch loses time. Mine loses about 20 minutes a day. What a disappointment."
4,It takes a lick' n,I previously owned a timex expedition and it ran beautifully for 6 years under daily work conditions. I was pleased to find the same style and model that I had and can only hope to have a similar experience.
4,"Solid, comfortable, does exactly what it should","This watch is exactly what it appears to be. I solid, basic, and very easy to read-at-a-glance watch. I like the clean appearance and the ""dress casual"" look of the band. It's very light on the wrist - easy to forget you're wearing a watch at all. One point off for a plastic dial window (Amazon says it's ""mineral"") which is likely to scratch easily. Date window is just large enough to be easy to read. Very satisfied with this watch."
1,"Timex, I am disappoint.","This watch fit the bill perfectly... for about two weeks. The adjustment knob tapped against a table and popped right out of the watch. Timex watches used to be made fairly well, I had my last one for about 12 years before it need replacing. Apparently, that time has come to an end."
4,Time for a little,I have gotten this watch twice. I lost the first and nothing out there could replace this watch at this price. It takes sweat and water perfectly. Wish the face was indented to avoid scratching. Otherwise no complaints.
1,TICK TICK TICK TICK......,"I really like the minimalist style of this watch, but the noise created by the second hand is so loud that it keeps me from sleeping. I can even still hear it when I curl my hand around it. Don't buy this watch unless you have moderate hearing damage. The noise is too annoying and this thing is going back to the store."
5,Great watch for outdoors activities,"I bought this watch for my husband to use fishing and hiking. I was familian with this watch, so I knew just what I wanted. Great color too!"
3,The band stinks if you get it wet,"I like this watch, but don't ever get the band wet! It smells awful! I tried washing the band in mild soap and water, but it made no difference."
4,Timex watch,My husband was extremely pleased with the watch that we ordered from Amazon.We have always been pleased with all our orders from Amazon.Thanks for fast and assurance of our order.C.B & P Webb
4,I like this watch.,"It is a little loud at first with the ticking, but I have gotten used to it. Doesn't really bother me anymore. Great watch over all. Easily readable, which is what I was looking for. It is light weight and comfortable as expected. Don't even know it is there unless I need to know the time. I recommend if it is your style."
3,a product of the Philippines &#65292; a little small..,A product of the Philippines &#65292; a little small for my brother..not exquisite enough&#65292;the case is plastic&#65292;just like children's watch.....
3,"Light & Fluffy, but Enjoyable","Great soundtrack, adorable lead. Fairy tale story based on actual events--a little bit of a stretch to believe that all but one member of the student body supported Marc's cause. What was with the father's character? He was made to appear ""retarded."" The DVD extras include a documentary of the real Marc and this event. For excellent, solid ""coming-of-age/coming-out flicks don't miss ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Get Real""."
4,A slick production and a good cast make it worth seeing.,"This is an enjoyable movie, actually a true story, about a gay teen who wants to bring his male partner to his senior prom. He runs up against the expected shock and outrage from the local bluenoses. No subtleties here. The characters are clearly divided into the good guys and the bad guys. A good cast of competent actors; a glossy production and cinematography help to overcome the occasionally heavy-handed and predictable plot. It's a well-done movie and it's definitely worth seeing."
3,Good and bad,The story is good and the acting is ok for a made for tv movie. The edit is pretty bad and at some times looks like a high school project. An overall good movie with some really bad points.
3,Schooling in Canada,"In line withMilk, a work is a semi-doco about Canadian activist having made a history with a court decission allowing him to bring a partner to a private Christian school party.A bit dramatised comedy with major characters played by actors more senior than other pupils."
4,Everyone should be so out,"This is a fictionalized reinactment of a true story, if I understand correctly. As such it is much more entertaining that a true documentary. It is worth a watch for people who feel out of touch with young gays. It would also be an educational watch for friends who think your gay experience isn't that different from their straight ones."
3,"No hugs, no kisses!!","I liked this film and just for a change a gay film with a light approach and happy ending. But, I waited a moment were those two get together and touch each other. Not any hot scene but a hug, a kiss! Even at the end when they finally were free to attend the prom, no warmth between them. I think the film missed the opportunity to show that we should be allowed to express our feelings towards our partner with no shame."
1,This is not a biography,"The only reason I finished reading this book was because I'd not read any about Duras.The writing is so stunningly bad that I had to control my anger as I read (melodramtic repetitions, little fragments that figure in soap opera, so on) because I was still curious about Duras and thought I might learn something. The translation is as awful as the text. (I'll save you examples.)This is not a biography. It's a badly written travelogue of a literary and political career. Duras constructed an amazing life and I look forward to a biography that might open that up.This piece of dribble is worthless."
1,Whaaaa!!,LOL...there has to be a mistake with the pricing here! These heatsinks sell for ~$25.00 new...I knew the price of copper was on the rise but...
4,"Not First Man in Rome, but intriguing","As a fan of McCullough's Rome series, I picked up this book. I enjoyed it, but it's not one I've returned to over and over, as I have with The First Man in Rome and her saga of Marius, Sulla, Caesar and the rest."
3,Not Rome!,"Disappointing. Tale of the Seige of Troy as told from the various participant's stories. No character development that compares with mccullough's Roman saga. However, not a bad read, but not something to stimulate either."
5,An excellent piece of work,"I can honestly say that this book goes down as one of my favourites; I couldn't put the book down and it's the only book to have made me cry. Brilliant descriptions, gripping to the very end"
3,Good For What It Is,"This is an excellent set of blues backing tracks. It includes slow blues, a couple of shuffles, blues in minor key and even a Latin type flavor blues. The tracks are about five minutes long give or take, and you set up your guitar (or harmonica or any other instrument theoretically) and jam. It's that simple. I intend to be jamming to this for a while.The back up band that plays this is Oscar Jordan and the Mighty Sons of Hercules. This is an actual band that makes recordings and plays in clubs. It's a talented band and a professionally made dvd. In addition to the backgroud tracks there are three live performances of the band."
3,Good animated film,"Kung Fu Panda is entertaining and funny at times. This is a very good family movie about a panda following his dreams. Po helps his father at a noodle restaurant but his dream is to become a Kung Fu Master. He then gets a chance to follow his dreams at the tutorial of Shifu, a Kung Fu Master. The movie is funny and entertaining. A good movie for everyone to watch."
5,"Awesome movie, and even better on Blu","I had not seen this movie in the theaters but I had heard rave reviews about it. So I snagged this one on sale. The movie is hilarious and very entertaining and the visuals only make this movie that much better. Watching this on full 1080p through my ps3 is just amazing. These newer animations on Blu Ray just look amazing. I will be purchasing anything made by pixar and or disney, not only because they look spectacular but they are usually quite entertaining."
4,Kung Fu Panda,The reason for this rating is the film was for the Grand son but the family had a good time with it also
2,Not worth the price for the Blu-Ray version -- No double-feature!,"I loved this movie. I saw it in theaters and knew immediately that I was going to be buying the Blu-ray version.However. This review isn't about the movie, which is great. This review is about the Blu-ray version.The DVD version comes in a double pack, including the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' ""sequel"" to the original movie. That's a huge draw of buying this movie.However, the Blu-ray version not only does not have the double-pack offer, it also does not have the movie bundled onto the single blu-ray disc at all, which means if you buy this version you miss out on the new movie.Why on earth would anyone buy the Blu-ray version if they're missing out on the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' sequel? It seems foolish.Bad studio decision."
1,Apparently pirated,"This disc was described in my player as disc 1 of 3, of the 3D Blu-Ray edition. NOT the same as the packaging. It does not play in any version of media player on my computer, as it is ""protected content."" Disappointing and sent back immediately."
2,If the kids find time to fight in the middle of a movie......,"We missed this one at the theaters and all four of my kids were disappointed. I promised them that as soon as it was released on DVD that I would buy it. Promise kept, movie delivered, and....they were disappointed. All the hype around the movie and all the anticipation of the movie wasn't really worth it. They were disappointed. It just wasn't that funny and it was pretty boring. If my kids find time to fight about something in the middle of a movie, then I know the movie was not the entertaining."
2,HILARIOUS Previews..... leading to only a so-so movie,"When I saw the previews of this movie, they were simply hilarious!Unfortunately, another case of the best parts of the movie being those parts in the previews, with the actual delivered product not living anywhere up to the hype.There were a few chuckles if you can wade through to the last 1/3 of the flick. Otherwise, forget it."
1,Two copies did not work,"Amazon's return policy is simple, which is good because we ordered a Kung Fu Panda Blu Ray and all the ""extras"" worked, but not the movie (we tried several other Blu Ray dvds and there were no problems); Amazon accepted our return and sent a new copy....same problem - when we selected ""play"" the entire player shutdown. So returned the second dvd and decided did not want to deal with this issue anymore and may purchase locally after I hear if others worked."
1,The latest from SchemeWorks,"The latest film from SchemeWorks Animation is Kung Fu Panda. Originally submitted in 2001 to 2002 by Terence Dunn, SchemeWorks said absolutely not, then rapidly began work on the stolen idea for a 2008 release.Mega Mind was stolen from many submissions by people from all over the world.To add insult to injury, Schemeworks has announced several sequals to Kung Fu Panda in the coming years."
4,Ms Evans,"An entertaining, Kung Fu Fun movie for the whole family. Love Jack Black as a big lovable Panda, a really fun movie for Kids and adults alike."
4,oh yeah,"this is a fun movie, and it does have a very wonderful message..... looking within.... characters are fun and the story flows. nothing too scary that i can think of...."
4,Some of the funniest fight sequences ever,"The one scene where Po and his Master fight over the dumpling -- by itself, this makes the movie worth the price of admission. I'm not a Jack Black fan, but I gotta admire his spot-on impression of a fanboy. (""Whoahhh!"") His voice work is all the more amazing when you leave the room and listen to it from the kitchen, and you hear the sheer variety of grunts, screams, and sighs he had to come up with -- all without any idea of how the sparring scenes would look. In animated film production, the voices are recorded first, and the animators ""draw"" to match them. This means that Jack (and all the actors) had to work from pure imagination. One wonders how many takes he had to do, until the sound engineers got enough different exclamations from him that they could place them wherever needed. My daughter LOVES this movie. A brilliant send-up of the Chinese martial-arts genre, without in any way being condescending."
4,great movie for the whole family,It is a great movie for the whole family. I think every one will enjoy it.
4,Kung Fu Panda DVD,"Item arrived on time and in good condition. Haven't tried it out yet as it is a Christmas gift. Saw it in the theater with the kids and enjoyed it, but it is somewhat violent."
3,change,This was recommended by a substance abuse counselor because of the positive messages for changing how you think about yourself. I enjoyed it but it wasn't anything new to me. Nice diversion. I liked the characters.
5,Great kids movie,Kids love this movie they can watch it over and over again. Had it on DVD but instant video is the best
5,Super Awesome Movie,"I love this movie even more than my kids do. Plus, how can you go wrong with a Jack Black movie?"
5,One of the best Animated Films Ever,"This is a top notch film. The CGI animation is great and the story, humor, lessons, etc. are great. Off the top of my head, I can't think of another CGI animated movie I like as much as this one, so it may actually be the best. Movies often have some dull spots, but this movie piqued my interest and entertained me from beginning to end. The quality of this movie is startling. All the Chinese themed graphics are wonderful. I also like and totally agree with the movie's big message: you have to believe in yourself."
1,My poor kids were so upset :(,"My boys looked forward to this movie arriving for WEEKS (literally, an item I had ordered days later arrived a week BEFORE this one!) Once it arrived I put it in their DVD player, and it couldn't be played in our area. Basically the movie was TRASH (which is right where it ended up) I came back to see if this had been stated by the seller (and it had) in very small print, I feel like I was fooled intentionally (they knew someone purchasing this would likely miss that) it is also stated ON the DVD case itself that it is of foreign format...It should have been put somewhere where the buy can clearly see this is a waste of time, and money....I don't reccomend purcasing this unless you look very very closely at what you're getting....And also, sellers....Don't sell a movie IN THE UNITED STATES if it CANNOT BE PLAYED IN THE UNITED STATES! My kids were terribly disappointed, as was I...."
5,Great movie,Got this and KFP2 for Christmas for my son. They are both so good I don't even know which one I like better. I enjoyed them both immensely.
4,Great Movie,This movie is fun for kids and adults. Blu-ray looks great for these animated movies. Of course buying through Amazon gets me the things I need quickly and usually cheaper than in regular stores.
4,Kung Fu panda,This was a great movie me and my daughter just love it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes animated movies.
5,kung fu panda - great movie,"Great movie, came in excellent time and condition , exactly as described! thank you so much"
4,Cute Movie With A Nice Message,"When I first hears about ""Kung-Fu Panda"", I groaned - Not another cute little animated movie with inside jokes for adults..But I was presently surprised, this movie presents familiar material in a fresh, fun manner. The animation is top notch as well. Kids can watch this and not get bored and adults will enjoy it as well."
5,Fun and beautiful movie,"The script is well written, and hillarious.The movie is BEAUTIFUL, i mean the picture, the detail, the scenes and the backgrounds... amazing. Takes you into another world. The music score is amazing too!"
5,Great movie,My 8 and 5 year old love this movie. I haven't seen it yet though. Got it for under $10 - great price for a great movie.
3,"Cute, children will love it","Kung Fu Panda is a beautifully drawn movie that should appeal to a broad audience, but more so for younger children. While I enjoyed it, I think it's far too predictable and not as in-depth as other works by Dreamworks or Pixar. The plot is very simple and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise and kids will really get a kick out of the humour. I found myself laughing once or twice.The voice cast is really great especially Dustin Hoffman and Jack Black. Again, the animation is brilliant and certainly some of the finest I've seen in a long while. All in all, a simple but fun movie that the whole family will enjoy."
5,one of my favorites..,"& my daughter's too. even when she could barely talk, i knew when i heard ""oso"" (spanish for bear), she wanted to watch KFP."
1,where is my order?,"Dear Public. I learned a hard lesson by ordering without checking reviews from sellers. READ THEM BEFORE YOU BUY!I ordered this dvd in early December for a Christmas present. The money was taken form my account and I NEVER RECEIVED THE ORDER. The Seller, MYSTIC never returned any of my emails or questions as to where my order was.DO NO BUY FROM THIS GUY! HE WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND RUN."
1,kung fu panda review,"The title wrapper on the case was torn all to pieces, so I was a little bit concerned with the dvd inside. I opened it and found the dvd to be good shape, it was not scratched up or broken like had suspected. However, when I tried to play it my dvd player it could not be read, so I tried it in another player....same message. I tried it is 3 dvd players total and was unable to view it on any of them. Very dissapointed. The return and refund process was very simple and easy. I was very thankful for that."
1,Not Happy,I have been charged for this item and still not received it. I have sent email after email to the shipper to no avail. They have not even had the courtesy to respond or let me know if my money will be refunded or if I will receive the movie I ordered. Any help Amazon can offer would be greatly appreciated.
1,did you watch this movie with a blindfold?,"I saw this movie with my children today and on a scale from 1-10 I give it a ZERO. There is one character who broke out of jail and came backto get some ""parchment with a magical message"" which he believed he deserved to receive. In order to get that parchment, he violently tortured, and attempted to kill the man who brought him up and loved him dearly. Never mind that this character is ten times the size of his mentor. This character will scare small children to death. He is VERY VERY VIOLENT,WITH A DISPLAY OF SUCH ANGER THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SEEN BY AN ADULT MUCH LESS A CHILD. SUCH A CHARACTER WOULD BE CONSIDERED MENTALLY ILL, AND CHILDREN WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE UNFAIR TO THEM. THINK TEN TIMES BEFORE LETTING YOUR CHILDREN SEE THIS MOVIE."
4,Jack Black the Panda.......it works...,"One person can add so much to the quality and fun when making a movie..and in this movie its Jack Black. Having seen the extras on so many of hisfilms, there is so much energy in this guys and he's always spreading itaround affecting those working with him. Well here we have Kung Fu Panda,working with other professionals like Dustin Hoffman, Angela Jolie and more...If you like a good fun animated movie, you should enjoy it...it you knowand like Kung Fu,,, its even more fun.Sure its not the best...but it did its job in entertaining.."
4,Awesomely fun Movie,Kunga fu panda is fun for both young and old viewers alike. It's a chamring movie with a lot of character.
3,"Uneven Quality CGI & Art, Limited Story, Just Rent It.","The underline message makes for a good family movie. But the graphics and art are unimpressive. The main character has great quality art/CGI, like facial expressions. Supporting characters have limited quality art, the rest are poor. With few exceptions, the music and scenes are forgettable. Last, the story seems to run out of steam midway into the movie."
2,Kung Fu Panda,"I had heard that this was a hilarious movie. I found the funny parts to be few and far between. My kids also laughed, but thought it was kind of slow."
3,Kung Fu Panda DVD,"Cute, entertaining DVD for child under twelve...Kung Fu Panda was a prized item under the Christmas tree..."
2,Love the movie but version I bought not widescreen,"This movie is the best but I was disappointed when I received the DVD because the listing says ""widescreen"" but the DVD I got was full screen. People, when you're listing a product and you're not sure of its specs, ASK SOMEONE!"
5,Entertainment for ANY age!,"I bought this DVD when it was first released and whenever my nephews came to visit, it was the first thing they wanted to watch. I finally gave them the DVD as a ""gift"" but, I missed seeing it myself. So I purchased another one just for me! Even though parts of it are somewhat violent, this is a real feel-good movie for all underdogs of the world. I never tire of watching it and I am a grandmother!"
5,great movie,"i'm not a cartoon watching person, but this is a great movie. something both kids and adults can enjoy together."
4,Cute Jack Black flick,"Jack Black provides the voice for an overweight panda with aspirations of being a kung fu master. His wildest dreams are met, but he must use his powers to defeat the evil tiger."
4,Cute movie,"Cute movie. Great cast of characters for voices. Kids under age 8 will not understand the humor or the meaning, but will still be entertained by the movie."
3,"good movie, but cheap package","I like this movie and thus bought this DVD. But the DVD case looks pretty cheap, which made me wondering if I over paid for it."
3,Not as seems,Purchased this movie as a present and was stuck with it because it came without a cover. Just a disk inside of a black dvd case. Not good for collecting movies.
3,Kung Fu Panda,"I would have liked a different actor as the mentor to the panda in this movie, but it was still a fair amount of fun and a good message. I was a bit disappointed in Dreamworks casting. Most families will enjoy it. The one voice that truly didn't seem to quite fit was Dustin Hoffman's. No offense to him but we needed someone who could have called Jack Black's panda, grasshopper. David Carradine would have been good in that role. Some may find Hoffman's high pitched complaints funny, it just didn't strike me that way. It is a fairly entertaining movie for the family. Good quality DVD with decent replayablity. If you enjoyed this catch ""Mulan"".CA Luster"
2,Too long to get their point across.,"We saw this movie in the theatre. It was a cute movie, but a rental or even a purchase (from Amazon of coarse) is a better way to see it.It was a very long movie for a 3-5 yr old to sit through. But it is very cute especially if your child likes Karate. The nemesis character is a little scary but not terrifying. My little one just couldn't sit through it all. Not Amazon's fault just a product of the movie.We bought it to add to our collection not because we loved it."
5,Great movie for all!,"My family and I LOVED this movie! It is very well made, with great characters and storyline -- an overweight panda who dreamed of being a kung fu master! Of course it's silly -- do you know of any pandas who can cook noodle soups? And of course there'll be punching and kicking -- it's a kung fu movie after all! The movie had several memorable scenes. One of my favorite scene was the one where the panda came puffing up the stairs to save his mentor. Gash, if I had to climb that many stairs, I'd be puffing away, too! LOVE that panda! Jack Black did very well as Po. The other memorable role belongs to Dustin Huffman as his unwilling mentor. I also learned a thing or two about the past, the present and the future, but I won't give it away. See the movie. Two thumbs WAAAAY up!"
4,Funny and Well Done,"Perfect well-animated flick for the youngsters. Great choice to have a laugh, enjoy the great voice cast and well written story of a sweet panda destined for greatness.Set in old China it has beautiful artwork as part of the appeal. The story is great, flows well and the characters are exquisitely funny and bright."
4,almost perfect,This blu-ray video freezes in 3 places and then jumps ahead a bit and continues to play from there. 3 of the Blu-ray movies we purchased for Christmas from Amazon do the same thing.
2,Much too violent for young children!,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. But finally having done so I am disappointed. It was amusing and the animation is good, but it is much too violent for children younger than preteen. The reviews stated that it was great family entertainment for ages 3 and up. I have a son who will shortly be turning 4 and found it unsuitable viewing for him. We were watching it as a family and found ourselves (my husband and I) horrified that we had exposed our son to such violence. I feel that the movie was misrepresented - all the previews depict is as being light and funny, and the reviews on amazon, as I stated before, suggested it was suitable for ages 3 and up. I am no prude but this film is clearly not appropriate for anyone that young. The violence was extreme and vicious, even by adult standards. It should have been advertised as such."
5,Po the Panda is Awesome!!!,Kung Fu Panda is awesome!!! Po is cute and funny and the story has a great message. I suggest that everyone buy this great movie! And be on the look out for a sequel in 2010 or 2011!Kung Fu Panda is my pick to win the Oscar this year. Come on and vote for Po! This is one of the best movies of 2008! Buy it now!
5,Kung Fu Panda,This is an excellent movie for the young or for the old. It gives an example of your own worth. You can do anything you want to as long as you believe in yourself and work hard to accomplish your goals.
4,Kung Fu Panda is funny,I bought this movie for something new for the family to watch. It's really funny - Jack Black does his magic again! Good family entertainment.
4,It STILL rocks!!,"This is one of those rare albums from the late 1980's/early 1990's that has stood the test of time. These homeboys were so far ahead of their time they could re-release this today and get a couple radio hits. Check out the rocking cover of Public Enemy's ""She watch channel zero"", the solid ""Time"", and hard rocking ""white hood"" and ""milkbone"". There is a little bit of something for everyone on this album.It was released around the time when Living Color was popular and it could have been easily overlooked as just another wannabe album. However, if you get the chance, check this CD out, I think you may enjoy it."
4,Fire & Snakes,Follow For Now was one of Atlanta's greatest misses with only one release. These dirty south players made some white kids shake it. You can pick them up in any bargain bin a well worth purchase. Fun funk rock from Hotlanta
5,Great Desktop Calculator,"This Calculator is perfect for your desktop. The Keys are big which makes quick calculations very easy. There are none of those unnecessary scientific buttons either. Plus, with its two way solar battery power, you can help save Earth Day. If you need some calculation support, buy this!"
4,An interesting and somewhat unusual artifact of the 80s pop landscape,"One of the bigger flukes of one-hit-wonderdom, Baltimora (born Jimmy McShane on May 23rd, 1957) had a surprise hit with the infectious, if somewhat silly song ""Tarzan Boy."" Though barely remembered otherwise (and scarce in all formats nowadays), the rest of this album is actually pretty decent, even with its air of silliness in some places. The title track is a catchy, well-produced piece of 80s synth-pop, and ""Chinese Restaurant"" is pretty catchy and hummable for a song with such a curious title.Note: You may notice when searching Amazon for this title, that there are two different cover pictures for the full-album versions. Unlike many other instances, there is actually a difference. The ""blue"" version contains two songs (The Jukebox Boy and Up With Baltimora) that are not available on the ""red"" version."
5,Amy,"We gave this backpack to our graduating high school senior for use at college. She absolutely loves it. The shape is comfortable and it will hold either her laptop or school books. She also really liked the color, being a little different than the basic black or brown. She wanted something different and unique. She already owns a Harveys seat belt purse and has enjoyed that very much. Very sturdy and easy to wipe down."
5,Andy Williams and Christmas - two that always go together,"The Amazon editorial review encapsulates the highlights of this CD nicely. These tracks are essentially culled from ""The Best of the Andy Williams Christmas Shows"" which is available on both VHS and DVD. Andy's voice is in peak form and every song is a winner, offering the best in both secular and sacred Christmas standards. It would have been great, however, to include some of the songs by both the Williams Brothers and the Osmond Brothers from the same television specials; maybe a Volume II in the near future, Andy?!?"
5,Good quality tool.,I find the fit is tight and not sloppy. I recommend this brand of tool. The length makes it quite handy.
2,wouldn't charge,"There was no electrolyte with this battery. I had to go to the autoparts and purchase acid for it, and had no way of being sure that it met Yuasa's specifications. This is the first powersports battery I have ever bought that didn't come with electrolyte."
1,Tancho Pomade,"Unfortunately this product was too oily for me and weighed my hair down, it has a nice aroma but didn't work for my hair."
3,Just ok.,"This product is very greasy, and has an almost overpowering lavender smell. I use it in my beard and mustache and can smell it all day long. It's enough to put you off your pudding."
2,Not for naturals or transitioners,I thought that it was packaged nicely but it dosn't work well on natural black hair if you are trying to tame edges. I can't speak for relaxed textures but I think it will work for them. Also some people liked the lavender smell but it was irritating to me.
2,Warning if You Have Kinky Edges,"This does not work as well if you have kinky edges. I have tried everything, mousse, gels, spray, waxes. That being said, if you have chemically straightened or curly/wavy hair it will keep things in place.I use it because its the best thing so far but I am still looking."
4,Great knife,"This is a great knife. Once you get used to it the spring assisted opening is very natural and the knife is shave sharp as I have heard others describe. My only reservation for a 5 star review is when I left this knife in my pocket and washed the jeans the black finish wore off in a couple spots. This doesn't affect its function in any way, just seems like it should have a more durable finish. No worries though I would definitely buy another of these knives."
4,Speedsafe,"I thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open. I was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster. Other than that, this knife is ultra high-quality, definately the best I have owned."
5,Kershaw knife,"This is the best Knife I have ever owned. Sharpe blade, easy opening. I bought this one for a backup in case I lose or break one of the two I already own. I do a lot of business on amazon. And will continue to do so. I can find most of what I want at good prices."
5,Kershaw Ken Onion Tactical Blur Folding Knife with Speed Safe,"I am a huge fan of Kershaw knives. This one is my favorite size and fits nicely in my pocket. The clip is good sinks in nicely. This is the second Blur I have owned. I broke the tip off the first, but these are not meant for prying on things that was my mistake. The only thing I might do differently next time is get a blade that's not covered in black. I am rough on these things and have already scratched it up a bit, but its still works great.The speed safe assisted opening works perfectly and I have never had a bad experience with a Kershaw knife."
5,Kershaw Ken Onion Tactical Blur Folding Knife,ive had this knife for 7 years and it has not let me down and is still razor sharp! i love it! DO NOT use it to pry anything the liner lock safety will open and the knife will close on your hand i had 8 stitches to prove it! the grip is rough at first but smooths out after 6 months of use. over all i would recomend this knife to anyone that is not a idiot because this knife will hold an edge
3,"Good knife, nuetered","Received knife with speed assist nob cut off. Returned thinking it was defective and recieved new knife in exact same condition. Now I have to spend 10 dollars and send it into Kershaw to have nob put back on that came from factory. What a joke. I do not live in California or Massachuesetts. Arizona does not try to protect me from myself nor does it need to. Not living in a facist state, I have no need for products that come nuetered (such as removing the fast opening nob on this particular knife). Do not buy knives from Amazon."
2,disappointed for a kershaw fan,"Love most of kershaw knives for what they are, dissappointed in this for the price, love my other kershaws though."
3,Tacticool,"This was My First E.D.C Knife, I Liked it, The Mistake I Made Was I used it For Everything, I Mean Everything Because Like I it was My First E.D.C Knife, Actually My First Real Knife. But I Dropped it at Work and it was open when I Dropped it so The Tip Bent 180 Degrees Enough For Falling of When I Tried Straightening it out Needless to Say it is a Good Knife But not my Preference, Theres not enough Blade For Me So I know Carry a S.O.G Trident, its 10 Times Better But, not to say the Kershaw is a Bad Knife I gave it 3 Stars Because it Does Hold a Good Edge, Trust Me!!!!"
2,Ken Onion Breakdown,"Okay, this knife was purchased as a replacement for a lost Kershaw. I would like to say the knife feels good in your hand and is lighting fast on the open. However, that said the knife is a piece of junk. The blade is a total failure, I use mine for gardening. The first thing I did was destroy the serrated edge by whittling down a survey's stake to a point. The second thing was I broke the knife point off when I tried to stick it in a board between cuts, I wasn't trying anything fancy like trying to throw it and stick in a board. BEWARE THE BLADE IS VERY LAME. The knife was exceptionally sharp when I got it, but by the time I sent it in for repair the edge had folded over as well."
2,Too bad...,"I was excited to purchase what I thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics, being a Ken Onion design. What I bought was designed to sell and not to last. The handle was textured on the sides, but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely, especially if they were to ever get a little wet. The thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly. The spring-assist broke after two months of extremely mild, absolutely non-abusive use.The $12.00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to Emerson makes the true cost of the knife about $84.00...and what if the spring breaks again? My advice is buy another brand.P.S. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick-opening folder, absent the ""blur."""
4,Awesome EDC,"This is the best knife I have purchased online so far. For the small size and weight, it is very firm and can take a lot of abuse. Blade is still razor sharp after months of use. The only complaint I would have is that the black coating on the blade scratches easier than I would expect. Other than that, I am very pleased with the knife and feel that it was worth every penny. Would recommend to anyone as an EDC even for people who use and abuse it a lot."
2,Great While It Lasted.......,I've been carrying this knife for about 4 months and I have never abused it or used it on anything tougher than cardboard boxes. The blade lock has quit working causing the blade to be unsecured. I loved this knife up until this point. Now it is quite dangerous to try to use.
4,Great knife,Love it just not ideal for leftys....but not much is!!Great assisted opening and serrated part is awesome for cutting rough things
5,Best Knife I Have Purchased,This is one of the best knives out there for the money. It opens effortlessly and is sized perfectly for a self defense/everyday carry pocket knife.
5,Beautiful knife.,"Opens very quickly, and very satisfyingly. No problems so far. Works like a charm. The knife, when worn, is point down, so be aware of that and your preference."
5,Kershaw Knife Review,"This is a good knife, especially for the price. The assisted opening works well and hasn't show any sign of wearing out. The knife itself is very durable. The handle has a very unique texture to it that not only works well, but everyone who sees it seems to like it. Overall the knife is great."
5,Great,"I purchased this for my boyfriend and he was really impressed. He has been using it daily for the past 6+ months and it is his favorite knife. It's really beautiful, sharp, sleek and opens very quickly. Overall, we are both very happy with the purchase."
5,"nice knife, seems to be very well made","I like this knife and I carry it with me all the time. It is sharp, very kewl looking, the spring loaded opening is nice, but I am not used to it yet and it scares me. Seems to be very sturdy/well-built, and I like the blade style and the blackened appearance makes me feel so badARSE, just like a special ops dewd. How kewl is that!!"
4,"great Knife, crappy packaging",I was really disappointed when my $60 knife came in a blister pack instead of a box. It felt like it took away from the knife when it looks like you could have and can buy at walmart off a rack. Anyway that's my only complaint. I ordered the Kershaw Blur Tanto on Friday and received it on Monday which was lightening fast shipping for 3-5 day service. The knife itself has a 14C28N blade which is very sharp out of the blister pack. Made in the USA. No blade play what so ever.the SpeedDafe assisted opening system is fast just like all the other Kershaw blades I own. Once again I'm very satisfied with my purchase and Kershaw has once again out done themselves. Suprised they would package such a fine knife in such sub par packaging but I will overlook it this time because the knife is so well made. The weight is 4.2 ounces but feels very solid. I would highly recommend.
5,Awsome knife,The only thing that needs to be said is awsome. I'm purchasing three more for Christmas gifts and one more for me to keep in the toolbox.
5,Kershaw Blur,"Living in Florida, we have to choose carefully the items we cary because of weight. We tend to wear shorts ant t-shirt all the time and sweat, so an item has to be light, but tough! I'm a concealed weapons permit holder and the Blur works PERFECTLY into my system. Its thin, light, and tough, so it works with all of the items I carry on a daily basis. If you're able to carry a Kershaw Speedsafe in your municipality LEGALLY, item I wouldnt hesitate! I've seen $300 Benchmade products that (in my opinion), are ne better than this $50 knife! I would depend my life on this knife, and do on a daily basis!"
1,dont buy this,This leash broke the day i bought it. i have a 40lb Norwegian Elkhound and it couldn't even handle him. i figured this wasnt really a quality product but i didnt expect it to be that bad.
1,Junk.,"I used this leash a grand total of maybe a dozen times. My dog saw a cat, took off, and snapped it. It says it's good for dogs up to 60 pounds, but I wouldn't use it for anything bigger than a chihuahua. What crap. Not only did I have to chase my dog for half an hour, but that poor cat may have suffered a heart attack."
2,Only good for 2 months,"Ordered May 1, broke July 6. It no longer retracts. It is a very strong leash, just has problem with the retracting mechanism, I guess."
1,Horrid,"The locking mechanism doesn't catch fully, which causes it to slip. I had to use my hand to hold my Jack Russel back from running in the street -- a function that should have worked with this leash. A week after purchase, my dog ran out, pulling the leash to its full 26 feet. It should have retracted, but didn't. I broke. Lovely. I learned my lesson about buying products that are too cheap and found a replacement. The replacement cost three times as much, but has been working like a charm -- like its supposed to."
2,Benchmark is far better,"I had the Benchmark and decided to get a different one as that is getting old. Benchmark is so much better than this Delorme in so many ways I dont know where to start. The organization is so poor, the roads are not differentiated, the rivers and creeks are not dark enough, there is no oregon map as a whole, and there are unnecessary color boundaries that get confused with roads or just become distracting. I still use the old Benchmark all the time."
3,There's better out there.,"I usually use this atlas in addition to Benchmark's atlas (ISBN-10: 0929591887). While the DeLorme is a good general atlas, I find that the Benchmark tends to be more accurate and shows more obscure goodies like mines and hot springs. Bottom line: If you are going to only own one atlas, get the Benchmark series."
2,"Fine if you're sticking to major roads, otherwise hopeless","This atlas offers no way of showing the difference between paved and unpaved roads. In SE Oregon it shows several roads I recently visited with the same markings as major highways. Some of these roads are gravel, some of them are jeep trails open only a few months of the year and requiring 4WD and high clearance. With this atlas there's no way of knowing that. See their map of the Steens Mountain area and Steens Mountain Loop Road - this road is only accessable with high clearance 4WD vehicles in late summer, but on this map it's marked with the same symbol used for the two lane, paved highway south of Burns. The road north of Fields is gravel, but no markings to note where the pavement ends. After seeing this, I promptly returned it and bout Benchamrk's atlas instead. Much better!"
5,Amazing Aussie!!!,I picked this album up out of the blue on a trip down under in the early 1990's. I was blown away. I would pit this offering against any of the popular artists riding the folk/acustic bandwagon she helped build. Enjoy this one for a $.01. What a deal!
3,okay book,this book was exciting and interseting...it lost my attention at some points...going on and on on little things....overall this is a great book...:-)
2,I did some research,"In follow up to my skeptical, first review of Mr Peterson's ""Gray Doom"", I researched the total population numbers. Here are the facts. According to the US Census Bureau, in 1999 the median age is 35.5 and the mean age is 36.4. In 2030, when the ""Peterson crisis"" hits, the median age will be 38.5 and the mean age will be 39.9. Yes, our total population will be older but I have a hard time getting too alarmed over 3 years. In fact, if wisdom comes with age, maybe our ""older"" society will be better. I think Mr. Peterson should present all the facts and stop trying to alarm us needlessly. By the way, is he a Democrat?"
4,Rumor has it...,"I enjoyed this play when I saw it performed live. I was extremely skeptical before, but there are many parts that I laughed the hardest I ever have. It is not perfect, but if you can see it live, go do it."
3,Rumors,The play was too wordy and too slap stick for my taste. I bought the play because I was going to audition for a part but decided not to go out for the play after reading it. Other people told me it was hysterical. I didn't think so.
3,"I love Techno, but this one isn't juts it!","17.98$ for 3-5 tracks that can be played in night-clubs. All of the tracks are cut, or don't have smooth ending. Very hard to mix. However, few tracks you mst have for your collection:1) Filterheadz Presents. Orange 3 - In your Eyes (Red Mix)2) Utah Saints - Morning Sun3) Dj Montana - Holla (Mimitri Andreas Mix) <- my favorite track on the CDIf you want to buy those tracks use Amazon Mp3, you will spend only .99 per track."
3,Let me explain my rating,"This movie is sooooo bad it's actually funny. It's a take off on 80s flicks with every cliche and plot line thrown in. The acting is terrible but Frazier Park gets some props. So, if you're a glutton for awful, check it out. You'll laugh for a few moments."
4,A good CD,"This was a first Ayu CD I bought and is still my favorite of all of them. She has pulled together all the best songs from her many albums, so I like almost every song on this cd. In addition, she has rerecorded a few of her earlier songs with a more mature, controlled, and developed voice. (ie, the same soul/heart but with less screeching.)All the songs are in Japanese and the Japanese lyrics are also included in the insert. (Why do American ""Best Hits"" cds never include the lyrics??!) She also mixes in ballads along with her techno/pop songs, so you get a good example of her range. If you've never heard her music before, I'd recommend this as an introduction to Ayu since it gives a good sampling of quality songs. If you're already a fan, then this is an essential addition to your collection."
5,"Certainly the ""A"" Best!","When they made this album, they weren't joking. This is the one Ayu CD to get if you never get another one (if you do, I recommend ""A""). I bought this because I fell in love with one of the songs, ""End Roll""; I had never heard most of the others. I've listened to this CD way more times than I can count now, and I love almost all of them.I've noticed that some of the other reviewers don't speak Japanese, which is unfortunate. If you don't know Japanese, you should try searching the web for song translations. Her lyrics are sad, sentimental, and very poetic and thoughtful. And somehow she manages to blend it with unique pop/techno music that just fits."
5,'wonderful cd',"this is a very 'good' cd!! ayu. is so cool person!! i love her music! i recommend this cd as a 1st cd to buy, and introduce to ayu's music."
5,YahOOOOOOO!!,"I absolutely LOVE Hamasaki Ayumi! This is a CD of all her best songs! If u loveeeeeeee Ayu, or u know someone who does, buy buy buy! It's worth the money and u will be soooooooo happy! Now all u need is some Gackt!"
4,A good place to start,"Ayumi Hamaskai (or just ""Ayu"") is the reigning pop diva in Japan. If she tries on a pair of sunglasses or boots or false eyelashes, the entire Japanese archipelago will be awash in teenage girls sporting the identical look. She dominates JPop in a way Madonna could not have dreamed of attempting in the US. In the December 31, 2004, edition of Kohaku, NHK television's massive annual New Year's Eve singalong program watched by millions, she was the climax, the grand finale clad in a cyber kimono (which she lost soon enough).Although she tends to squeak on high notes, her voice has mellowed a bit as she has matured. All the songs on this CD are in Japanese (the Japanese lyrics are included in the insert).There are ballads and techno/pop, so you A Best gives the listener a good sense of what she is capable of. A good comparison would be to the more recent Cyber Trance Presents: Ayu Trance."
4,Great CD not so great CD cover,Great CD however was disappointed that instead of having a festive palm tree cover I got the trashy Mrs. Claus.. oh well!
1,"Hate to Differ, But This CD Doesn't Sizzle or Swing","Given all the great reviews this CD got, I thought it would put some latin sizzle on holiday songs. IMO, it doesn't. Not at all. Very bland, easy listening type ""jazz."" If you want a great Latin chrismtas CD, check outMambo Santa Mambo: Christmas From the Latin Loungesold on Amazon. Now, that's a swinging CD that will have you dancing and singing."
3,Great movie but terrible print,"Bluebeard is definitely a film to rediscover. It might not be Ulmer's best but there's enough here to please any serious movie lover. John Carradine gives the performance of his life and although it's obvious that budget is non existent, Ulmer solves the problem with beautiful expressionist sequences, very Caligaresque. Real problem is the print that is often pretty terrible, bringing serious frustration. Have Scarlet Street from the same editor and print is terrible as well."
1,Unwatchable & indecipherable,"One of the worst looking and sounding DVDs I have ever purchased. I like Ulmer, and didn't know this movie but I had to finally just turn off this DVD because I couldn't STAND IT ANY LONGER. Blurry picture & distorted sound taken from a 16mm print (I'm guessing). A rip off. AVOID!!!"
2,Boring and dull,"Lousy slow-moving movie especially at the start,Carradine looked better as he aged.Reminded me of The Phantom of The Opera movie,below the streets of Paris.Really disappointing,at least for me John was a good actor,just not in this."
2,Obsolete and too obvious,"I have been an angel investor for about 7 months and am eager to learn more about angel investing, so that I can do it better. Sadly, I found that this book was severely out of date, and most of what I read in it was the same old stuff I've read elsewhere. I don't yet have an alternative book to recommend."
5,Bengals,"I love the Cincinnati Bengals and this sign is great, i recommend this for any Bengals fans."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY! NO DRIVER FOR W7 OR VISTA,"Please do not waste your money, this may be inexpensive but it is useless and not comes with updated drivers, instead you get a card with a web address, there are no drivers to download, i try a driver of a very similar model, the only driver I found, all I got were blue screens when trying to connect something, the video is very low resolution and not in widescreen. A total waste of money and time. If you really need a docking station made &#8203;&#8203;sure it has been manufactured in this year (or at least 2011)"
2,Only reason to buy is the musical,"The only reason to buy this set is the musical, ""Once More With Feeling."" Joss consistently let us down during the season in the name of ""realism"". Why wouldn't Xander and Anya have gotten married? People with a lot of doubts and faults get married all the time. Then they get divorced later. That is real. Magic = drugs? What a preachy annoying concept that certainly was never mentioned before and not real in Buffyverse. The Slayer getting raped? How stupid is that? How about the only character who behaves like an adult but is also a lesbian getting killed? I don't know if it's UPN's fault or Joss Whedon's, but season six was terrible. I kept watching thinking it couldn't get worse, but it did!"
2,Mediocre At Best,"Despite a strong conclusion and phenomenol musical episode I felt a bit cheated by how the characters and their storylines bent so drastically in so little time from what they had been earlier. After five strong years, the shows age was beginning to show and it never recovered since, but still if you love the show I suppose you'll pick this set up. For first time viewers, do yourself a favor and get an earlier season (3 is their best)."
2,"Barely watchable, certainly not worth watching twice....","Everything falls apart this season. They had developed some pretty tight characters, and decided to toss all that character development out the window to force weak story lines. Then they toss in the trio of super nerd villains who are about as interesting as Jar Jar Binks. Seems like every episode in season 6 is a sad plea for help from a series that has lost its way."
4,"Depressing & different, but good","Buffy Season Six is very different than what you have seen with the past five seasons. The show is much darker, more graphic, more intense. The main complaint about season six is the storyline.Essentially, every character on the show becomes self-destructive. While this is something that does happen in life, watching these characters you know and love destroy themselves and each other is painful. All season you have to watch them go through pain and inflict pain. There is some good stuff in there, some of it is just tough to get through.Season six is definitely my least favorite season, but if your a Buffy fan its still worth watching. But on thing is clear at this point in the show: Buffy ain't for kids anymore."
4,"Season 6 was ""ok""","It wasn't neccessarily the worst season. No that fate would fall to the final season,season 7. This season had alot of good ideas and themes, some of them weren't executed in the best way(changing Willow's obsession for power into a drug metaphor for instance). But its a very enjoyable season. It has the best episode in the entire series,Once More With Feeling. The musical episode. Plus other good eps in the season are Bargaining part 1,Afterlife,Life Serial,Tabula Rasa,Dead Things,Normal Again,Entropy,Seeing Red,and Villains."
3,A mostly negitive season with one saving grace.,"This season wasn't dark is was depressing and self destructive it was also a hell of alot better then season 7 that had almost nothing good to show for it. Season 6 did have Buffy and Spike which was by far the most interesting relationship I have ever seen on TV. It was also one of the hottest on screen sexual relationship I have ever seen. It pretty much is the only reason to buy this DVD. The writers tried forcing there own personal issues about addiction, drugs, sex, and bad relationships on the audience and it failed miserably."
1,(...) this season was [the] weakest,"(...)If you're a new fan you've probably heard that this season was by far it's worst and must be surprised to see so many people here endorsing it.Let me you in on a little secret that's not really a secret: Most of the people describing it as ""brilliant"" and ""so dark that most people wouldn't understand it"" are overly devoted fans making excuses for a sub-par season. It's riddled with unfunny third-grade sex jokes, and some very stupid moments and a forced rape. Season seven accomplished a darker tone than this mess. Buffy creator/writer/producer Joss Wheadon was off creating a great show called Firefly when this disaster occured. The loss of his prescence was obvious.If you're a completist, I'm positive theres nothing I can do to sway you otherwise, but if you're unsure don't listen to this small faction of people putting this season on a pedestal and saying it was Buffy's best. It's just not true. Rent it if you can, but purchasing it would be investing in a"
3,yeah,"It was a dark season. It was like they tryed to copy Angel and failed.The only redeaming quality was that the villian was Willow all along in the series. It was a little too late though for me. It felt like this season dragged on. I didn't like the Villian-Geeks.The Singing episode was pretty good too. It's no Becomming prt. 1-2.,The Zeppo,Hush, Restless,The Body."
5,Awesome!,"I've noticed that among fans, this season is really underrated. This is perhaps the darkest season for Buffy. The characters are truly becoming adults, and the transition is difficult for all of them. This is the season that showed the biggest transformation in all the characters, especially Buffy and Spike. Over all, I think this was my favorite season."
2,Why?,"To be blunt I didn't exactly like this season, There were a lot of boring episodes, while Once More With Feeling was good I'm not one for musicals though, the Willow magical addiction was ok but not strong enough to save the season, Spike and Buffy really damned the season for me, Dark Willow was great as a Big Bad and Alyson Hannigan (I don't know if that's spelt right) did a great job. All around not my favorite season."
4,Multi-region DVD owners beware,"This is fine, but late. Check www.Amazon.Co.UK, and you'll see that season 7 came out there months ago, Angel season 4 has been out for a couple of months too. Buffy season 6 was last year's news!Buffy is selling for 29.99 GBP, which is a bargain. The UK packaging is better, and from season 4 onwards they're in widescreen too - which isn't a cropped version, it's actually using footage never seen on TV in the states.Warning though, they are region 2, which means only people with multi-region DVD players can play them."
5,Buffy was the most underrated and best tv shows in history,"Alot of people i know dont like Buffy the vampire slayer because they think its really cheesey, but once you get past that you see that the show is actually very whitty and has great writers like joss whedon.Season six is very cool and I like how they focus on Willow and Tara a bit more and we get to see how powerful they really are i mean when they brought Buffy back from the dead that was friggen cool! then at the end of the season when the sweetest and most ignored character of the show Tara dies it sends Willow on a wickedly cool rampage to kill Warren.Anyway i wont spoil anymore because im sure you will want to discover all the highs and lows of this fantastic journey.I definately recomend to any buffy fan and if your not try it you got nothing to lose!"
5,good,"I have watched half of the series and so far so good. It also arrived in great condition, and on time. I'm happy with my purchase!"
2,Okay,"This season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was not bad, but a far cry from what made the show so unique in its earlier seasons. Granted the growth the characters had to grow up after season five, but the way the writers could have managed the whole situation could have been better. Althought the muscial and bad Willow episodes are fun, these positive gaps are too few and far between. I would recommend to just catch these episodes when they are in reruns."
4,Still Great Love the series,This season was funny espically with those three guys i liked the relationship with buffy and spike but i wish it could have been different. But i like how he got a soul because what he was doing to buffy.And also i like how spike fell in love with buffy.
2,The truth is: all of them are insane....,"The truth is: all the characters in this show are insane, make totally absurd decisions that sometimes even make innocent people die (Xander in ""Once More With Feeling"", for example) I don't know what Joss Whedon thinks, or how he thinks. He took a fantastic set of characters and threw them all around just for the sake of shocking the audience, not for the sake of history telling. He made Willow gay; he made Buffy sleep with TWO (not one, but TWO!!!) vampires; he made Xander let the lovely Anya at the altar; he made Joyce send Buffy away from her home; I could go on and on....There is also a funny thing: Joss and the producers say they are very aware of the continuity, but this show should be called: ""PLOT HOLE, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"". There are so many of them, so much inconsistencies, so much things unexplained, so much verborragy that explains absolutely nothing"
4,all good things come to an end.,"I still miss this show. Okay, earlier seasons were more fun, but that's life. The characters were younger and just figuring life out. Now they're adults. Okay, they're adults living on the hellmouth but still... I wasn't a big fan of the final espisode but considering that SMG wanted to pursue other projects, the network change, the adult figures in Buffy's life weren't around anymore, the Scooby Gang are now adults and they're still fighting demons on top of that?! Give the writers, cast and crew a break. All shows get stale with time but ""Buffy"" was still entertaining. Dark? Yes. Sad? Yes. Stil wickedly funny? Yes. It was a good end to a great series. BRAVO. BRAVA."
5,continued excellence!,"Living overseas, I've watched the majority of Buffy on DVD. The wait for Season 6 was unbearable, but well worth it! As was the case with each previous season, Season 6 had no let down. In fact the darker plots and feel made the season even more compelling. Away from the darkness, Once More With Feeling (my favorite episode) made for some lighthearted entertainment. Now the wait begins for the Final Season...One additional note...I like how Fox has priced its DVD series. Unlike other companies that really gouge on DVD series prices, Fox gives great value!"
1,Pure Garbage,"If misogyny, rape, torture and murder is what gets you off, then by all means be one more mindless whedon-drone and spend your money on this.But for the rest of us that have matured beyond comic book level writing and snuff fantasies save your cash.Season 6 is widely considered to be one of the worst (the worst is Season 7) one of Buffy and the one where the show jumped the shark.I fail to see how this can be called a &#65533;feminist&#65533; show when in the end all the shows women have been beaten, broken, raped or killed and the men get the big rewards (I guess if you try to rape someone you get your soul back.)Don&#65533;t waste your money. Don&#65533;t waste your time."
1,DONT BUY THIS UNLESS........,"i bought the set the very first day it came out a found out that the second episode wont play. AFTER LIFE is messed up on the dvd. i even exchanged it hoping that i would fair better, but the second one is also messed up. so only purchase this piece of crap if you dont want to watch the entire season."
4,Better the 2nd time,"I had real difficulty watching Buffy season 6 when it was first broadcast on UPN. This season saw a lot of depressing episodes, which led my brother to lable it the ""slit your wrist season."" Now that I'm older, though, I can better stomach the mature themes from s. 6. Once More, with Feeling and Tabula Rasa are of course favorites from this set, but even some of the episodes I didn't enjoy earlier proved to please. It seems that after Buffy's main metaphor of adjusting to high school/college was played out, that the writers struggled to find exactly what they wanted to go with, resulting in the VERY heavy-handed nature of Willow's addiction to magic, which in seasons 4 and 5 had been utilized to represent her lesbianism. I actually enjoyed this set more than I did originally, and hope that season 7's set will again surprise me."
5,The Best,Nothing else to say but that this was the best TV Series ever made. And this was the best season.
3,The Decay of Buffy,"I am a huge fanatic of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the series. While I do enjoy this season, it destroyed the show entirely. Granted making the characters mature and grow is one thing, but forcing them into 'out of character' stances was just beyond me. This was truly the decay of Buffy."
3,Hit and miss,"This season is quite good. It starts out strongly and includes what is, in my opinion, the best episode of the series, the musical. However, a few episodes later there is the terrible episode ""Wrecked."" Willow's magic=heroine storyline is amateur writing, in my opinion.Despite the flaws, I will recommend season 6. Buffy/Spike's relationship is complex and the chemistry between the actors is sizzling, the musical is outstanding, and there a number of other excellent episodes: Afterlife, Tabula Rasa, and Dead Things."
4,Oh Grow Up,"This was the theme of Season 6 according to Joss Whedon, and it shows through almost every episode.When it first aired I had a difficult time with the story arc. It felt as though they were out of ideas. But it turns out that this is an arc heavy season. Meaning the character development can't be seen episode by episode without the context of the whole.I was annoyed and bored by the Trio until their actions turned to murder. Then I started to see what was going on and what the show was getting at. None of the characters this season know how to let go of thier childhood, for the Trio and Willow, this leads to deadly consequences.I went from being lukewarm about Season 6 when it first aired to raving about it by it's end.It's the most difficult season to get through because it's incredibly painful and sad. Though I never warmed to the charater of Tara, her death is very moving. And Xander's crayon speech is on the money as a payoff.It's well worth the money...Go for it."
2,"Can you say ""Jumped the shark""?","Yes, it has the musical, but what the ones writing sonnets don't get is breaking of the relationships that defined the show killed it. Giles taking off, Buffy sleeping with Spike and invalidating the Angel relationship, the Geek Villians.. that is the definition of ""jumping the shark"" as when Happy Days died after the Fonz literally jumped a shark with his motorcycle. The original premise of the show, a small quirky blonde teen saving the world, was also invalidated as Buffy Summers became a morose burger-flipper slacker who just got caught in strange circumstances each week.Season Six was an anticlimax from Season Five, and a let-down as Joss ran off to do Firefly.The whole ""why am I back from the dead?"" was Joss revisiting his failed attempt of Alien: Resurrection. The series never answered this question very well. It just didn't, but that's a discussion for when they do Season 7 on DVD. :)"
1,This was awful,"This season was awful, with the notable exception of the musical episode. Buffy started out as a great show, and then somewhere along the way (season 3-4?) it became a metaphor for a successful child star who ruined his life with drugs and alcohol, sinking ever-farther into his additions. I still don't know what happened. Did Joss and his writers just run out of good ideas? Or did Joss, secure in the success of the show, feel free to indulge emotional issues he'd never been able to resolve? Where is the joy in watching characters about whom you've learned to care sink lower and lower in their lives until they are perpetually miserable? I loved Buffy the first couple of seasons, liked it the for a couple after that, but it should have ended before this disaster came along and I still thought good things about Buffy and Willow."
4,Dissapointing,"Season 6 was a fantastic season but I just have to point out that this box set is pretty dissapointing. There are many glitches in 3 of the discs and especially during the amazing musical episode ""Once more with feeling""- which is letterboxed, not anamorphic widescreen. I don't understand why the US sets are done poorly then the R2 ones. Also there are plenty of spoilers spread throughout the artwork so if your watching this season for the first time, you might not want to look at the designs and quotes- especially the cover."
2,When the series really lost its way,"What really characterized this season was bad, lazy writing. Instead of themes of empowerment from previous seasons we have a really messed up Buffy/Spike relationship (with tacked on attempted rape), a really lame after school special (and total cop out) with Willow's ""magic crack"" storyline, and none of the characters acting in a sympathetic way (and completely out of character ways...example Gile's ""good luck Buffy, you're on your own, exit.""). This barely scratches the surface. There can be ""dark"" good and ""dark"" bad. With the exceptions of OMWF and TR this was mainly ""dark"" bad. This is the season that many of the actors (SMG,JM, etc.) stated they had real problems with the script/content.S6 - The show now is officially a soap opera. And the ratings reflected this..Buffy had the most preciptious drop in viewers during this season than ever before. And from which it never recovered."
2,It's all downhill from here folks!,"Season Six can best be summed up as the Nude Spike season. Oh yeah and bad interpretations of drug use. I give this season 2 stars, since it is not as wretched as the horribly boring season Seven. ""Once More With Feeling"" is the real stand-out show of the season with Tara providing the best voice."
4,One of The Best Seasons!,"Season 6 of Buffy is awesome and has lots of great episodes and I loved the relationship between Buffy and Spike, well it started off really hot but I hated it when Spike got obsessed and took things to far but all in all a good season and one of the best but I can't rate it a 5 because of how twisted the Buffy and Spike relationship got."
4,Follow up to prior review,"Since my previous review, the owner of this company communicated with my sister and has promised to note caution on the packaging of the kennel. He has also reimbursed her for the product, which she has now donated and he also compromised with her for the medical charges for her dog's injuries. Even though this product did not work out for my sister's purposes, the feed back and communication of the company president made up for any product short coming and the result is positive. This is an excellent company with customer service one can count on. We are very pleased and hope the product works out for other's."
2,"Incomplete, dis-jointed, unclear","This is a pretty bad book. It's the 2nd Thomas book, I've ever bought - and I hope most of them aren't as bad as this one. There are several stories in this book, all of which seem to have chunks of the stories missing. It is very dis-jointed. The illustrations (which are photos of the train models) do not help the reader to figure out what is going on in the story. The words(vocabulary) that are used seem to be somewhat unusual (perhaps - they are british terms) - which do not help. This book is not worth the money or the effort. Although my 3 year son doesn't seen to mind too much, it certainly is not his favorite book. Besides, it is frustrating to the adults that have to endure reading this to the children over and over."
2,"Hopefully, a better one coming","Great post WWII Christmas movie but this DVD is not issued by a major studio, hence the quality is lacking. The DVD version ,here, is better than the VHS version sold prior to this. The DVD sound is OK but the picture is quite fuzzy. If you want to purchase this movie on DVD, check out the Warner Home video issue that is due out in Nov."
3,GOOD,GOOD FILM FROM THE BYGONE YEARS. YOU CAN ALMOST ALWAYS DEPEND ON AN OLDER FILM TO BE UPLIFTING AND HAVE CLEAN CONTENT. THE STORY IS VERY INTERESTING.
4,Super movie,It happened on 5th Avenue is one of the best movie I've seen in a long time. Victor Moore is always a joy to see and so is Charles Ruggles. I like him in everything he does.
3,Enjoyed enough,"Unfortunately the product description didn't mention that the movie was in black and white. Based on the movie jacket, I was expecting it to be colorized. The movie was entertaining enough."
1,Story of a rude house invader and squatter,How they decided to make the person who owned the house a bad guy is beyond me. Oh this is your house? How dare you decide what you want to do with it.It is ours now.And once again business owners seem to be the bad guys too.Very bad movie.Nothing to do with Christmas too.
4,Skipper-The Early Years,"Marketed by Warners as a holiday film this barely qualifies with a brief Christmas scene at the end. What the makers are trying to capture is a Capra-esque feel and they nearly succeed. They don't quite meet those lofty heights but they have concocted a disarmingly amusing confection. And Gale Storm is as cute as a button. About the only real criticism I have is the flick suffers a tad from overlength particularly for a comedy. Otherwise, it's not a bad way to while away the winter months."
5,It Happened on 5th Avenue,Shared it with a group of my friends during the Christmas holidays. It was surely enjoyed by all of us. jmhirsch
4,"It's sugar and spice, smooth and nice and has surprise bite.","Plano is a mix of cocktail lounge music, with a dash of pop and retro to make a great mix of intriguing sounds. It's the words that grab you. The beat says one thing and the lyrics say another to create this blend of sadness or sarcasm covered with something so sticky sweet you can't get enough. The Navin brothers have put together an album that is unusual and refreshing to hear, it appeals to your strangest and silliest senses. You find yourself tapping your foot to the catchy beat and tuning into the almost sometimes maudlin lyrics. Perfect group to hear at 2 a.m. in the lounge of your favorite club while sipping on a martini. I also think their music would be great in a movie soundtrack, it would certainly catch the audience's attention."
5,The best!,"It's appropriate that the first song on this album is called ""Chocolates"" - it's sugary and sweet and oh so very nice...i read some critic describe this album as ""crystalline pop"".I happened upon Aluminum Group while I was working in Banana Republic - bored out of my mind, folding clothes - then all of a sudden ""Chocolates"" started playing, filling the stores and my mood just totally changed...i went out and bought this cd right away and listened to it multiple times for years.i recently rediscovered it playing in an art house movie theater -- i have to say this album is by far the quintessential one out of their offerings - like the lyrics in ""Star Wish"" - ""star wish, you made a mess of my lifecause I wasn't thinking clearly when I saw you falling out of the sky"" ... love it!"
3,Clever Gay Lounge Pop,"The Navin brothers have definitely studied hard at the school of pop. Lush, complex harmonies and inventive arrangements make this a must for anyone smitten with the charms of The Devine Comedy, Momus or Pulp at their most romantic.Fans of Jimmy Webb and Burt Bacharach's orchestrations will be able to admire the songwriting craft. It may be too sugary sweet for some palettes."
2,disapointing,Not much porn. A waste of money if you want to see some thing like the title suggests. These words are added to fill in the minimum requirement.
1,do not buy,"do not purchase, do not even think of buying this video. it should be illegal to sell something of such poor quality. not clear, dark copy of movie. if they pay you to see it do not do it."
3,GOOD DVD,ITS A GOOD DVD BUT ITS REALY SHORT. BUT IT WAS THE ONLY DVD OF PORTER WAGONER THAT I COULD FIND AT THIS TIME. I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO FIND A COLLECTION OF ALL HIS HITS SOME DAY. THANKS FOR HAVING IT - WILLIAM
1,excentric prof's coffee chat,"i strongly disadvise this book as a learning tool. ""students"" of mathematics who wish to explore the nature of ""proofs"" should definitely pass this one up. polya is much better!"
5,nice reading for the general public,"Very nice book if you are in high school or in college and would like to see how mathematics evolves. It makes a very pleasant reading although the mathematical ideas behind are not trivial.It discusses polyhedra in 3 (or more) dimensions and Euler's formula that describes their numbers of vertices, edges, faces, e.t.c. The challenge is to determine what specific kinds of polyhedra satisfy the formula and conversely, how one could generalize the formula so as to describe more (if not all) polyhedra. Lots of historical references illustrate the fact that the discussion is not naive and that reflects the actual history of the subject.One can realize through this book that math people are not Gods and do not produce theories out of nowhere, but they experiment with their objects like any other scientist, and then try to summarize in an elegant/rigorous way."
1,Useless book,Simply drop it. Polya's Mathematics and plausible reasoning is the right book. I have been reading books to understand conjecture making. This one turned out to be useless.
4,Good camera - just of couple of minor negatives,"I bought this camera about 8 months ago. Just a few 'negatives' I'd like to point out. (1) It is a bit bulky, so sometimes a bit cumbersome to carry around with you, but then again, so are many of them. (2) The zoom switch really takes some getting used to. In the beginning it would zoom in or out completely in a microsecond the moment I tried to zoom a tiny bit. Did not exactly make my films look professional. Now I've gotten used to its sensitivity and its a lot better. Separately, there are SOOOO many features to this thing, I had to read the (bulky again!) instructions manual three times and still I probably don't know and definitely don't use 3/4 of its features. But, all in all, it's a great camera and I have zero regrets!"
2,very confuessing,I should have know there was a misstake with the picture!!! you donot get 500 gig hard drives for $9.00 . Iam suprise to see it's still picture the sameway ???? I feel I should have got the hard drives for that prise .ALL the other items where right and the shiping the Best Ever. The main reason I'll buy more here.. AND Thank You.Jon Anderson
1,SOULFUL CHRISTMAS,"IT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED, THE TIME LIFE SOULFUL CHRISTMAS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE 2 CD ONE. THE DARK GREEN PACKAGE. ""TITLE SOULFUL CHRISTMAS"""
4,Far better than the alternative,One thing I dread about the holiday season (other than the obscenely large crowds at the mall) is the constant soundtrack of tired Christmas crooners everywhere you go. This album keeps the holidays going without invoking a gag reflex.
4,Un disco bueno,Este Cd tiene varias canciones buenas. Me gusta porque trae un poco de todo y si ud es una persona que quiere un poco de todo este disco lo tiene.
5,King of the Gypsies,"All the other reviews here talk about the story of the film. I enjoy that as well, but what they miss is the music. Hidden in this film treasure is a sound track scored by Mandolinist David Grisman. In the movie he performs with several members of his quintet/quartet. More importantly, he imported the great Gypsy Violinist - Stephane Grappelli. Grappelli is the noted violinst who performed in the 1930s and perhaps into the 40s with the legendary Jazz guitarist - Django Reinhardt. Grappelli's performance is awesome. Want a real taste of Real Gypsy violin playing??? SEE THIS MOVIE!!! It should not be missed!!!Also note that shortly after the film Grappelli & Grisman teamed up for a live album on Warner Brothers. It may be out of print now. It also features musical greats Mike Marshall and Mark O'Connor. Grappelli and O'Connor play twin fiddles on Tiger Rag. Ahh... Music at it's best!!! ;-)"
4,"Pretty Much Agree with the Other Reviews, Except...","One of the other reviewers is mistaken when they say that the movie was based on a novel. It is actually based on a NON-fiction book by Peter Maas, who also wrote Serpico and The Valachi Papers (and who also just died yesterday, Aug. 23, 2001). Unfortunately it is out of print. Some similarly excellent reportage on the subject of gypsy culture (from the 30's-40's) can be found in Up In The Old Hotel or McSorley's Wonderful Saloon, both by Joseph Mitchell."
4,Should have been more epic-like.,"I first saw this movie in my late teens when it was on tv. Only managed to catch the last half of it and thought it was good. Been trying to get a copy to watch the beginning for a while. For some reason I can relate to the Eric Roberts character.After finally getting the dvd recently and watching the whole movie, I realise that it could have been a much better movie. It should have been made more epic and Godfather-like. The Gypsy culture is fascinating but you only get a glimpse of it. You never really relate to it like how the Godfather made you relate to Italian gangsters and their families. Nevertheless I think it is worth a watch if only see how much Eric Roberts and Brooke Shields have changed since the late 70's."
4,Some of the best hip-hop of the year!!!,"Del and the Hieroglyphics crew have been making some of the finest hip-hop for a long time. They come together with some other gems to produce one of the best hip-hop albums of 2005! If you love alternative hip-hop of the hieroglyphics crew, defiantly pick this album up!Check out tracks 2,3,4,6,7,11,12 and 16. My absolute favorite song is 12. I love Del's catchy verses and obscure references."
2,World's Worst Soprano Shrieks Again,"The same team that brought us Puccini's Le Villi now brings us his second opera, Edgar. Once again it features a soprano who will make cats flee. She sings not just one note but those surrounding it as well. These tone clusters are further enhanced by a fierce vibrato. (Think Florence Foster Jenkins.) In addition she is a terrible actress of the Look-Ma-I'm-Acting school. The other voices are no great shakes either (pardon the pun). The opera is wisely performed without an intermission which prohibits the audience from leaving. Perhaps one day there will be a good performance of Edgar on DVD. Until then stick with the CD with Scotto, Bergonzi, and Killebrew."
1,"AWFUL SINGING, SILLY PRODUCTION","I think 'Opera Lover' must have a family member in the cast. This looks and sounds like a high-school production of the opera--painful singing (except for a few moments from Martí), ludicrous acting--and what about those wigs!"
4,Razer copperhead is top of the line,I purchased thise mouse once and it lasted a very good amount of time. When It 'died' I contacted the provider and sent my old one in for a new one. The mouse feels perfect in my hand and easily is my fav mice I have ever used in my 20+ years of comp use. I simply love this mouse.
2,Typical Lousy Razer Performance,"The Copperhead was my 3rd and last attempt to get a decent performing gaming mouse from the Razer people. I have had 2 Diamondbacks and this Copperhead, all with inherent problems that could not be resolved. The biggest being the expense of the mice.The Copperhead being the worst of the three with an update format that takes a rocket scientist to get it figured out and never really stood up to half the work it took to get it working second rate. The Diamondback's both would drop out on ""boot-up"" and leave you mouse less. I did ALL the updates and preps by the manufactures specs and never got them to work right. I have given up on Razer and I suggest that any good gamers not waste their money on Razer's product!I give it 2 stars and that strictly for the lights and color."
3,A Fair Attempt,"I bought both this and Volume 2. Returned Volume 1 and am not too thrilled with Volume 2. I have much better books on the same information which include easier to understand instructions, illustrations and certainly a much broader spectrum of challenges. Artfully illustrated but too limited in my opinion. It covers only one technique many time over. Volume 2 goes just a little beyond that! As a design instructor I used the art of ""POP UP"" as a tool for my students to use paper engineering to exercise their critical thinking skills. I would not have included either volume in my recommended reading for that purpose. It is more of a ""cut and paste what is already provided"" example of a very limited number of techniques."
4,pop-up book making,the Pocket Paper Engineer book is very informative from tools that you'll need to templates for a variety of designs. The only negative i have is that i wish it wasn't on spiral for greater ease of removal of the templates.
3,Only scratches the surface...,"This book looks well designed & presented on the surface, however the overall content is fairly disappointing. The book covers very few pop-up techniques and lacks further expansion into more creative & complex paper mechanisms. I would only recommend this book to those who are true beginners in areas of paper crafting & pop-up construction. For who are aspiring to dive into paper engineering more thoroughly & learn of more in-depth pop-up design & theory I'd recommendPop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculptureby Duncan Birmingham orElements Of Pop Up: A Pop Up Book For Aspiring Paper Engineersby James Diaz & David A. Carter."
5,Soft :3,"i have a big wrist but it still fits nicely without cutting off circulation or anything xDand its softand the shade of red is perfect, its like blood red.and you can go running with it on and it won't fall apart ^_^ and it absorbs sweat pretty good as well."
5,New England Yuletide--Apples and Oranges,"This CD is different from New England Christmastide though it brings back many of the same wonderful musicians. This collection has a mix of more modern songs like White Christmas and Little Drummer Boy on bag pipes but still has the beautiful old fashioned favorites such as Once in Royal David's City, bringing back that same nostalgia for a simpler time. Songs that are on the first Christmastide are given a different treatment on Yuletide...so that Soalin into Deck the Halls has a different feel than on the first Christmastide CD. My personal favorites on this album are Jingle Bells, O Holy Night with flute and banjo, Silver Bells with fiddle and hammered dulcimer, and Glocester Wassail with the Enigmatica Mandolin ensemble featuring Marilyn Mair from the first album. It's a really fun CD."
3,Similar to Christmastide,"This is an enjoyable CD, though it has some tracks that are on the NE Christmastide CD. I prefer the Christmastide to this one."
3,Dont Mess With The Master,"Another one trying to be like the master. This is not Gorky Park. What it is, is a very good second class. The location of Moscow is always written as dark and bleak and he does that well. The two main characters working together does not really work for me, I did not believe the reason they were together thus there pairing put me off of the book. For those of you who like a story to have one main plot and not confuse the issue with too many extras then you may enjoy the book. The characters are average; more detail would have been nice. Overall I think this is an average effort in this rather crowed field."
4,magikal elektronika!,"joy electric mesmerizes with an album of medieval themed songs that seem to come from the farthest reaches of nintendoland! leaving behind the candyland whimsy of melody, we are the music makers is a consistently darker and more haunting record filtered through the majestik romanticism of the middle ages. the songs tend to have a sameness, but that doesn't prevent the cd from drawing you into the new fascinating world of wonder and awe joy electric creates!"
4,It's diffrent then the other cd's but it's still cool,"I was a Joy Electric fan before I got this cd. I looked up this cd online and I found out my friend, whom I borrowed her Christian Songs cd from, had this cd and so I borrowed it and I thought it was cool. Ronnie Martin, who is the vocalist, is very creative in making the music. All he uses is a synthesizer and no other traditional insterments. This group is also a christian group so they don't sing anything bad. The music is really great but I enjoy the other cd's better. I do like # 1,2,3,4,6,8 and 10. You might enjoy this cd like I did."
1,Not what I expected,I heard this was supposed to be a Christian techno album. I listened to the first two songs and I hated it. It's like Gothic meets the Main Street Electrical Parade with just a tiny twist of Bible scriptures. It was nothing like I wanted.
1,Cannot view,"I was unaware that this DVD would not play in the USA, It was not marked so that one can easely see."
3,bad movie,"This is a waste of time and money to watch this movie.I usually like World War II movie, but this one I will only give 3 stars, I won't recommend it."
1,Not much her,"I have no idea why this movie was made. It takes an epic moment in history and superimposes a pseudo love story, lesbian chick flick type of genre over it. There is a reason nobody has ever heard of this movie and more of a reason why few ever will."
4,A Movie that Makes Its Point,"Despite the happier than reality ending, this movie provides a window, albeit a narrow window, into what it was like in Leningrad during the blockade by the Nazis in WWII. The important point it makes is the level of Russian population's suffering in only a small part of the nation during the war and the heroic acts of the Red army during the period."
3,just ok,"Good story line, terrible voice over, I mean terrible. It was distracting, hard to enjoy the movie because of it."
2,This is for fundamental only (black cover),"upon receiving this book, i was very disappointed because it was for fundamental level only (a black cover). Without the picture nor detailed discription, I bought this book by mistake. This is not what I need/want. I was so upset:( I was expecting an intermediate level of chartbook by Azar.so customers, be smart. Don't buy this book unless you are expecting a very basic level of grammar chartbook."
2,Only for the die-hard fan,"Okay performance by O'Day--not at the top of her game. Recording is from a radio broadcast--the audio quality is fair, at best. Not essential, try almost any other of her studio recordings first."
3,Frustrating!,"Graphics are wonderful! The storyline is intriguing and the music enhances the scenes. The puzzles/tasks were mostly logical. I was unable to complete the game when I reached the ""timed"" puzzle. I did not have enough time to complete. I realize that I could have started over and probably done better, but I didn't love the game enough to do it. I prefer games with some lightness in them--this one was so emotionally dark! I will probably try again on a cold rainy day when I have nothing better to do.I would recommend this game to dedicated, persistent gamers looking for something ""different""."
2,Even if you DID read the book...,"The graphics were sub-standard, the movement is linear. It's ""360"" degree movement is basically being able to turn your head around a pinpoint spot, which has really no use. As a teen, the opera music, albiet harmonic, was tediously repetitive and overall unappealing. I did not read the Ring novel, and have absolutly NO clue as exactly what is going on. The mouse control feels slow and unresponsive, especially for a PII 400 w/128 meg ram system. The feeling you get when playing this game feels more like being stuck in a box with the bland environment and non-logical puzzles and terrible voice acting. I gave this a 2 because the installation and UNINSTALLATION were flawless. Pity I bought this game from CompUSA on a whim. I'll just consider this a bad investment. Don't make the same mistake and avoid this game."
3,"nice polish, very brittle bar","the polishing qualities are very good, However the bar is brittle and after little vibration when applying the bar broke into 3 pieces. Still able to be used but it is more difficult"
4,"A good first camera, or a back-up camera","I already have a bigger, heavier, super-zoom digital camera, so I bought this one to have an easy carry-anywhere/all-the-time cam. It's small, light, easy to learn and use. I got about 100 pictures off of the provided 2 alkaline AA's, but I bought some good NiMh rechargeable batteries for going forward.It has many fancy post-processing features that I choose not to use. I favor ThumbsPlus or GImP.I only ding it for no optical zoom. It's a good deal for the price (as of mid-2006)."
2,"Read the book, forget the audio","Forget the audio, read the book. The audio is severely hampered by the reader's constant interruption to give footnotes. Every few minutes we are forced to listen to endless repetitions of footnotes, many coming from the same report or source.There MUST be a less intrusive way to accomplish the same thing.Begin by the reader saying ""this book has 3 million 700 footnotes"" Give the website, where anyone interested can log in and follow up to view them.Then give a straight numerical listing as you narrate. ""Footnote #1.... Footnote #2... Footnote #3, etc.""The intrusive reading of every single footnote caused me to stop by the third cd. Sorry. Read the book instead."
1,Propaganda at best,"This book is nothing more than propaganda, written and packaged in a manner that attempts to incite the patriotism of the readers in order to bring them to the author's obviously biased point of view. The author frequently cites statistics without source and uses one-sided examples and stories to prove his point. As an American Soldier (Marine), I am offended by the presumptions made within the book on the lack of morality of servicemembers who may not believe in the author's particular God."
2,Disappointing....,The title captured my interest but the negativity expressed through some of the descriptions of battle scenes bothered me especially since I have active military experience. Gross descriptions of allied soldiers killing Iraqis and then questioning motives did nothing other than undermine the reason the soldier is serving. Drawing quotes from Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 film disappointed me as I do not see Mr. Moore as a credible authority on the war and the American soldier. A little more independent thought from Mr. Mansfield would have made better use of my time. I do NOT recommend this book unless you are anti-war and looking for reasons to criticize our troops.
1,over charged,"Erie Book Emporium over charges. I ended up paying over ten dollars for a USED VHS tape, when I just got the DVD two pack movie for $8 from someone else."
2,A few Good tracks,"I'm a big Sinead fan, so I'm being honest by giving this album two stars. Of course her voice is top notch, as always, but honestly--does this album garner heavy rotation in your stereo?""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" puts Madonna to shame--she can't sing compared to the great Sinead. ""Success Has Made a Failure of Our Home"" is riveting. The Track I love is her heart-wrenching ""Scarlet Ribbons"". You can hear Sinead almost crying while singing this powerful, gorgeous song. This track alone is worth buying the album."
3,WHY? Here's why.,"Reading the liner notes, you'll see that Sinead explains the ""why"" as to why she recorded an album like this. So I understand why, and I fully respect it. When I listen to it, I cringe at some points (imagine Sinead going ""boop boop ee doop""), but I do what should be done, and listen to the whole thing (with the exception of the horrid last track, the instrumental of ""Don't Cry For Me...""). If you haven't heard it, then check out the sound clips above. If your computer won't play them, then just imagine her singing to some Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughn tunes. Only hard-core Sinead fans should buy this album. Listen for her speaking at the end of the last track-it's worth it."
5,Excellent interpretation of classic songs,"Though some feel she betrayed her audience with this CD, she in fact showed what a powerful artistry she can bring to this music. Out of the several thousand CDs I have, I find myself listening to this one more than any of my other CDs. An accomplished artist performing great music."
2,Great Voice Sabotaged by the Wrong Material,"Sinead O'Connor took it on the chin, both critically and commercially, when she released this album of show tunes in 1992. While her voice is'nt the problem, these songs are simply not her forte. Sinead never gains command of most of the material and the big band that backs her is jarring. The are a couple of exceptions: the opening track, ""Why Don't You Do Right"" is familiar Sinead material (perhaps the quality of this song raised my expectations of the album) and her version of ""Don't Cry for me Argentina"" is superb - Sinead's lets her anger ebb and allows her vunerability to show. But the rest of the album never gels and borders on unlistenable. It took Sinead nearly a decade to recover from this mess."
