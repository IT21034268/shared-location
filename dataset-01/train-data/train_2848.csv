3,Back in action,"Not quite sure why I picked this up originally. It's not quite what I expected, but I'm glad I did I bought it.Tess"
2,Returning For Several Reasons,"Just received this to give to my kids for a Christmas present. However, after testing it, I will be returning it.Pros =* Decent price* Bright images and had fun changing the shapes. I could create small and large images (filled up the wall leading to the basement).Cons (reasons for returning) =* The motor keeps making a horrible, piercing noise during use. This is on top of the normal loud noice from the motor. I believe it is damaged.* After watching the red images on the wall for a few minutes, my eyes felt like I had been staring into a bright light or sun. It lasts only a few minutes, but enough to consider this not suitable for my children. My husband had the same effect. (NOTE: we did NOT at any time stare directly at the lens/light, just at the images on the wall)."
1,Does not work at all.,"The mini laser show that I had purchased was nothing but a piece of junk. When I received it, it did not work at all. The laser did not turn on when I put in the batteries and tried to see the ""laser show."" The only thing that worked was the spinning mirrors in the machine. Before I discovered that it was broken, I was disappointed by the laser's size. It seemed extremely small and fragile. It was most likely damaged during shipping, but I am definitely not keeping this. It will be returned to the seller. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Underwhelemed .... Not so great,"Got mine for $10 and was so excited ... Until it arrived. It's exactly as described, but it's just not all that great a light show. Has very limited options (despite what appears to be an infinite number of possibilities) and it runs through batteries really fast.Not even for the $10 bucks would I recommend it .... it's boring."
3,not bad for a small little light show,"got this for a 7 year old boy, he seems to like it, not a bad little laser for the price."
3,Not what I was expecting but still fun,"I thought this wouls make a better light show, I bought it for parties and we will have a blast playing with it but I am sad its only one color and the display is a lot smaller than advertised."
2,disappointing low power!,"I have been looking for an item like this for DJ / Party / Disco events, to complement other lights & music systems. This thing seemed like a good idea, the reviews sounded great so I bought it, but the cheapo laser unit is so weak that it only works in a completely dark room. Any ambient light at all and the patterns produced by this thing just disappear.So now I am looking at another much more expensive device, or cutting this thing up and adding a green laser module so you can see it.If it were brighter it would be great, especially for Halloween, or shining thru smoke at campfire.Buyer beware! Check those mW ratings, anything with less than 10mW is too weak for anything useful."
2,Cheap,"When i got this product yesterday i was very disappointed when i took a look. Even though i knew it would not be concert material, i did not thing it would be something i could find at the dollar store. If i was to give it a price it would be around $3 or $4. No where close to the price. Very cheap plastic. Takes AAA batteries that are NOT included. Also it required a very small Phillips screw driver to open the battery slots. Not worth the money it is selling for. If the price drops to $3 go ahead and get i; but not until then."
2,Not worth it.,"Very boring,the lights dont change colors and it does the same 4 or 5 things over and over all the time.dont waste your money"
2,Not Pink Floyd,"It's definitely small....and the pattern is not as big as I was led to believe, and as far as using it outside, don't expect Floyd-like results. A green light laser emits about 3x the light, but expect to really pay for it.It's a nice toy, but not much more...but for the bucks, I'm not disappointed."
1,kinda lame,I guess you get what you pay for. Small plastic item that has 1 simple red pattern that doesnt do much. Maybe if you bought 2 it would be better and still cheaper. The $100 models still are way better and have more features than just a red circle or square. From the reviews I was expecting a little more. Not much but a little more.
4,"Mighty Mini Laser Show- Long Lasting, But Brightness Lacks","We got this for a Haunted Trail inside a ""cave"" with fog machines. The device itself is very compact, portable and easy to use. Has a nifty kickstand and can run in MANUAL mode-- where you change the beam and mirrors-- or AUTO-- where the unit itself loops through a pre-programmed show of all its different effects. Runs on 2-AA batteries that lasted well over two hours set on full AUTO. My biggest disappointment was the brightness. It looked quite cool through the fog, but wasn't very bright considering we were inside a ""cave"". Other than that, I was very happy with it and will use it next year."
1,barely visible,"This laser is a cool idea, battery powered and small enough to fit in your pocket. However, there really isn't any reason to buy this because even in the darkest area of my basement i could barely see this from more than 2 feet away.I tried using fog to see the laser ""stream"" as well (the same amount of fog and darkness really brings my other laser projecter to life, and you can see the beams of light which is an amazing feat for $30 - [...]So the laser inside is quite dim, or underpowered, im not a pro, but when i compare to my other projector, there is just nothing in THIS product that anyone would really want."
1,I woudn't spend $5 for this,"I honestly don't know why anyone would give this more 2 stars. You can change the shape...sort of. It has a pattern for each shape but you can't really control it nor can you control the speed. It flashes at an odd rate and you can't change that either, gives everyone a headache.Used it for a party but people asked to turn it off. I also bought another laser, the mic doesn't pick up on the music but it didn't annoy people like this one. I am returning it even though I'm losing the shipping cost and restocking fee."
3,Disappointed,First I though it would be bigger. And the recipes more exciting.. To all fairness I have not read the whole book or knitted anything from it. I though it would inspire me more. It didn't. And it did not tell me anything I did not already know. If you're just looking for recipes you can find a lot of good stuff for free at drops knitting on the web.
4,10 Trick or Treaters is SWEET!,I bought this book for my 19 month old. She loves the colorful pictures and the rhyming verse. She asks me to read it to her all the time.
5,Love it,Great book for the concept of 10. My kinders enjoyed the book and asked for it again and again! Great illustrations.
3,Still dependable,"Though the twists are obvious, Gores can still turn the pages. Good beach book. No heavy lifting."
4,BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK,"WHEN I PURCHASED THIS BREAD KNIFE I WAS FULLY AWARE, BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, THAT THIS WAS NOT J.A. HENCKELS TOP OF THE LINE PRODUCT AND THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MADE IN CHINA. SINCE I WAS NOT WILLING TO PAY APPROX $100.00 FOR THE TOP OF THE LINE VERSION, I DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE THAT IT AT LEAST WOULD BE MADE TO J.A. HENCKLES STANDARDS. TO MY SURPRISE, I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!! THE QUALITY AND CRAFTSMANSHIP WAS EXCELLENT. IT HAS GOOD BALANCE AND CUTS EVERYTHING FROM HARD BAGELS TO SOFT CROISANTS EVENLY AND WITH LITTLE EFFORT. (LIKE A HOT KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER..NO PUN INTENDED)...NOW THE ONLY TRUE TEST IS HOW LONG WILL IT HOLD ITS EDGE SINCE THE BLADE CANNOT BE EASILY SHARPENED..ONLY TIME WILL TELL. FOR NOW ITS ALL THUMBS UP!!!!!"
4,good price-good knife,"Ordered this for a friend at Christmas who just broke her expensive bread knife. She loves this one and it was much less than her original knife. Very nice weight, style, and sharp - great price - also, since it said Henckels, she never knew it wasn't top of the line product."
5,J Henckels,Buy your beautiful wife knives from J Henckels. It will result in many smooches. Trust me. I speak from experience.
3,ok knife,"nice looking knives, feel great, scratch easily though. I am no sure they have the quality of other knives in their price range."
4,One of the most refreshing CD's I've heard in a while!,"This is definatley one of the best disc's that I've heard in a long time. I was lucky enough to stumble apon Ruxpin one day while record shopping. I was instantly hooked and had to go out and buy the CD. Ruxpin's style is a perfect cross between Plaid and Boards of Canada. It's really super smooth, but not so ambient that you want to take a nap. If you can, also check out his first CD called ""Radio"". It's a little hard to find since this guy's from Iceland, but definately worth the time spent looking. If you like Ruxpin I highly recommend checking out Bola as well."
5,Shakespeare Even Greater Than I Thought!!!,"This is one of my favorite books of all time, and changed my assessment of Shakespeare, actually increasing my opinion of his genius. This is the first of 3 Girard books I have read, and perhaps the best. His insightful analysis will make future Shakespearean reviews seem superficial. This book is exciting enough to get us to head over to the Stratford , Ontario summer theater to see The Winter's Tale live, which Girard says is Shakespeare's greatest achievement. ( I suggest the Folger Shakespeare Library edition. )"
2,The Valentine Star,The book called The Valentine Star is a great book. Its a great book to read during Valentine`s Day.The book is a bout a girl named Emily. Emily was a girl in Mrs.Rooney`s class. Mrs. Rooney`s class always have to make Valentine`s card for someone and put it in the Valentine box. Emily coudn`t be happier because Dawn Bosco gave her colored stars to decorate her cards with. Also during Febuary Ms.vincent the sudent teacher sudent teacher came along. Emily wanted to make a card to Ms. Vincent.I think this book is os good. People sould read this book because it is Valentiffic.
1,Beware of this listing,"One may assume (I did) that when the listing for this item shows its shipping wieght to be 4.1 pounds and when Amazon calculates its shipping cost to be over $9.00 (before the $25 free shipping option) that you would receive multiple boxes of the gum but no you are going to receive one 4 oz box of gum for a whopping $14.54. I bought this because the local Walmart does not carry this brand of gum, however, for comparison I have bought a 1.6 pound bucket of Double Bubble gum at Walmart for a little over $6.00 while Amazon is charging $14.54 for a tiny 4 oz box of gum. You also can't return it because its a grocery item.I have to assume the listing is a mistake because I've never felt taken advantage of by Amazon but this is/was a total rip off.EDIT: Amazon did right by me and gave a refund."
1,I don't even plan on selling this back; I'm burning it.,"This book is, to me, a terrible source of information. Just about everything that the authors describe can be done so much more concisely than they are capable of doing. Sure, in the very beginning of the book they acknowledge that it is a difficult read (an understatement), but that is why good authors revise their texts to make it as understandable as possible for those who have to endure its contents.The headache associated with this book is the result of classical conditioning; I read nonsense, nonsense elicits headaches. Operant conditioning has evoked a response in which this book will be burned when I am through with it. Oh... and selection, selection, selection! I want to gauge my eyes out!One of my classmates mentioned, ""I may as well be reading Spanish."""
5,"Black Mountain - - whackos, psychos, egos, and heros.","Wow! What a story. Who'd expect a NYC Subway Cop to be the hero in a murderous tale set in the rugged Wyoming mountains.A hotshot New York Govenor (read presidential aspirant) arranges a wilderness trek in the Rockies. Included in the Gov's entourage are his wife, political sycophants, a political reporter, and a reluctant NYC subway cop the Governor thinks he's rewarding for bravery. The story is chock full of marital discord, politics, and egos, along with infidelity, terror, and murder and the expedition party being stranded in a blizzard. The NYC tunnel cop, John Corrigan, and the political reporter, Dara Wylie, team up to guide a dispirited group back to civilization and safety. A great story. Read it."
5,Black Mountain -- An Engrossing Page Turner,"What a great book, Read it in one evening, this is one of those books you don't want to put down. Being a fan of the mystery/thriller genre I definitely recommend this book."
4,Well done.,"This is extremely well written and carefully crafted. A novel that is both a thriller and a whodunit. I have thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Standiford's John Deal series, and this departure showcases his depth as a writer.There are enough twists and turns in this cat and mouse plot to keep your interest from start to finish. The characters are a bit larger than life, so there is a need to suspend your disbelief. It is ordinary people performing extraordinary feats.There is a great deal of attention paid to details and for this reason I feel this book will provide even greater pleasure to those who hike or climb mountains."
3,A Bit Hard To Believe.....,"While I enjoyed the read, there were just too many bad things done to these people to be believable in the setting that the book takes place in. It would be next to impossible to orchestrate all of these ""accidents"", and have them all go smoothly, while all along a blizzard rages on.The blizzard almost kills our hereoes, but the villians just go about their business and create more havoc for the hikers.There are also some similarities to Deliverance that could almost be considered plagarism.I know you're supposed to suspend disbelief, but I frequently caught myself stopping and thinking to myself, ""No way that could happen""."
3,"Equal dis-opportunities, please","Although this is an enjoyable read, I am tired of reading adventure novels in which every possible calamity befalls the hero while the villains go unscathed (until the finale, that is). For example, in this story, a sudden, unexpected blizzard wreaks havoc on the good guys while the bad guys seem to have emerged none the worse for wear. How come?"
2,Where's John Deal when you need him?,"I was disappointed with this book mainly because I found myself comparing it to Standiford's previous efforts with contractor/hero John Deal.The characters in this book were cardboard, at best, and one could see the plot coming a mile away. Go back to Florida. This was a ""Bad Deal""."
4,A great book for the study of Anglo-Saxon magic,This book contains a wealth of history and theory concerning ancient Anglo-Saxon magic. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks expand their horizons in their understanding the mindset and origin of magical and superstitious practices within the Northern tradition.
3,This is a Guide to NYC,This was Chuck Fischer's first book. He did this one right after he moved to NYC. The later ones are much better
1,Macdonald Rhubarb,"I bought 2 types of rhubarbs, the first one is doing very well. The other one (Mcdonald Red Rhubarb) were dead at arrival. I plant them right away but they never make any leaves."
2,died,thing died dont understand planted as soon as I got it. I will say it looked good when I got it but died.
4,Very Informative!,This book contained everything you could wish to know concerning just about every physicist that has had a major scientific contribution. This is a great book for intermediate scientific readers. I also liked that it had diagrams especially drawn by the author himself.
1,AWFUL!,"This phone has horrible sound quality -- conversations are turned to ""huh?"", ""what?""... after 8 months of wrangling with VTech, they finally sent me a 2468 model which is MUCH better sound quality. I wouldn't buy another 9161 if my life depended on it!"
1,Inferior quailty,This phone is obviously a cheaply made product. It yet again proves that you usually get what you pay for.
2,For electronics experts only!,"This book is geared towards electronics engineers. Unless you own at least an ocilloscope and a lot of other electronics equipment, this book will be useless to you."
4,The ultimate reference book on the subject,"I have been using this book for a little while now, and I had to just buy my own copy (some ""friends"" I have :) ). If you have some signal processing background, this is the book for you, but it is probably too technical for the average electronics tinkerer or computer geek. It provides great explinations and useful circuits that let you dive into the world of cable scrambling and descrambling. The theorys presented in this book can also be used to scramble signals on other kinds of systems for semi-safe transmission"
3,Expected more software and system...,"The book covers the hardware development of video encryption systems, but does not cover the software or systems function as well."
4,Great book!,I bought this for my little brother as a Christmas gift and he's loved it. He was 12 at the time and I think he liked that it said Teen on the front.
5,Great Devotional,"Knowing how great other Stormie Omartian books are, I ordered this for my 16 year old daughter. It is one of her favorite devotionals!"
5,A Must Read!,"Prayer is something that really lacks in a teen's life from my experience. This book shows that it is a neccessity in life. It also shows that any problems with may deal with that God can be there to help you through it all. All you need is the connection with him through prayer. I recommend you buying this for your kid, or buying this for yourself."
5,For my two daughters ages 14 and 17.,I haven't asked the oldest recently if she has read it all or parts. But I liked what I seen in it. and plan on keeping to share with others as well. Again love Stormie Omartian.
5,It fits!,"Well, I just measured the diameter, and the description was matching. And surely it fits. That was my only requirement. One down side of this order was that I ordered two of them, and they charged S&H of each, but sent them in one package. And S&H is expensive relative to the price of the item. But given that I could not find this in stores, it's still fine."
5,CLASSIC TWILIGHT ZONE MUSIC!,"Most definately if you're into TZ then you will love this disc. It has some of the most memorable scores from some of the most memorable episodes, and they sound great considering when they were made especially. ""Nervous Man"" is cool, as are the ""Invaders"", and ""Where is Everybody""-the 1st show, but the whole disc is great, and you even get to hear the legendary TZ opening and closing music, which anyone over the age of 10 has to have heard. A MUST for TZ fans! JOHN"
5,You like the Zone? You'll LOVE this CD!,"Relive all the thrills of many of the original Twilight Zone episodes in this unforgettable CD! The music sounds old and dated (and not very modern), but the sounds are full and the orchestration is brilliant! A Keeper!"
2,It's Okay.,"I can appreciate Graziano's ability to capture those moments in life that others may choose to overlook. His use of irony gives strength to his work. His crude humor adds acidic flavor. This is a collection of poems I can read once, and then again to mull over during the course of a few days for a review, but be happy not to own. I would not put this book on my shelf for me to find someday in the future and accidentally read again. To do so would be futile. Unless you enjoy reopening old wounds or visiting dark alleyways, then this book is for you. I would much rather enjoy poetry selections written through a different perspective, an overall more positive, inspired view."
2,Disappointment,"I wouldn't recommend this DVD for anyone who is looking for truth in the DL area of the gay lifestyle. When you see the young men chosen to complete the documentary, there is no way possible for these four guys to be considered DL in any fashion...they are too efeminant."
3,Downlow Documentary,"I thought the documentary was extremely amateur and missed several opportunities to touch upon the subject at a deeper, level encouraging more critical thinking from the men chosen. The fact that the down low phenomenon occurs across gender and color lines was completely excluded along with other important topics. It was a bit shallow and vague, but had great potential. As there is so little covering this subject, I'm glad that someone was brave and committed enough to go for it, but there is much more work to be done. This video also seemed somewhat reverse classist in that the phenomenon seemed to only interview impoverished people as though they are the only ones living on the downlow."
1,I think I missed something here...,"Which one of the guys in the film was on the DL?...They were all clock-able if you ask me. DL men wouldn't even show their face on camera, that's how DL they are. And I didn't get the blurry effect, I seriously thought something happened to my DVD player. Honestly, I think I would have preferred hearing from ""real"" DL guys who really wanted to protect their anonymity by hiding behind a screen. I think they would have felt comfortable telling what it's really like to be on the DL, without fearing any repercussion. Also, though this movie depict men of African decent, I hope the viewers understand being on the DL has no racial boundaries...all races and cultures are included in this phenomena."
4,it coulda been more longer but it touch the heart its worth buyin,"its not right how mans betray woman like that i been living a holy life for a long time im ready to get married and start back having sex again stuff like this make a strong woman mad ,sad and scared we only want to be happy,faithful an truthful with that lucky man hell im not going to blam mans only cause womans just keep making same mistake to exsample maury show.so womans give hiv to they man to may we all be strong keep the faith.an low down mans STOP IT BE TRUTHFULL AND LET US WOMANS BE ITS NOT RIGHT ITS ARE CHOICE IF WE DONT WANT TO BE WITH A MAN THAT LIKE TO HAVE SEX WITH A MAN TO."
4,interesting docu gay film,"on the down low was a good movie done documentary style. i enjoyed all the stories of each character. the film is very up to date and deal with real issues. it really makes you think about the down low world and how big it really is. one drawback, the film needed to be longer."
1,curious,I didn't enjoy this @ all! i was under the impression that this was a movie but it was a documentary. very low budget documentary! i would not recomend this film to anyone! Sorry!
5,Great Book!!!,I got this book as a gift and have found it to be of great value. Rakel does a great job explaining the options of integrative medicine. Well worth the money!
5,Know what you're buying!,"For the few people that complain that F13 is not a real game--read the reviews, preview the package BEFORE you buy--if you were expecting a full-length, feature game then you only have yourself to blame! It's evident that it's a time-killer rather than the standard computer game. However, for true Stephen King fans (and for those who love to find new ways to kill time at the computer), this is a must have. Great features, lots of fun...and purely King."
5,"Control, Alt, Shiver","This is a must have for old and new fans alike, the creepy sounds and wallpapers as well as the ghoulish games will keep you busy for a while. As an added perk, you get to have SK himself typing up a new spooky read from the corner of your desktop window. Control, Alt, Shiver is right!-Dawn"
4,A Great Gift for the Horror Collector,"For those of you who aren't familiar with F-13, it is a complition of games, screen savers, scary sounds, backdrops, and a short story. My favorite backdrop is the cemetery. I tried using the screensavers (It's just lightning was my favorite.) and had memory problems on both my Performa and my iMac. Any suggestions out there? There are oodles of scary sounds, some of which grossed me out. The games are good too. Whack-a-Zombie is challenging and very addictive. I liked the variety of the ghouls in this game. Bug Splat is somewhat addicting and very gory. No Swimming was fun for five minutes, but then got a little boring after the fifth cow got eaten. More variety could've been used with that game.Everything's Eventual was very good. I won't spoil the plot for you. You will just have to go out and buy it for yourself."
2,not a game,"this is only a couple of screen savers, and 3 mediocre games. the games are not even desktop worthy. this truely is not worth anyones money. it really should be freeware."
3,"Unfortunately, Not EVERYTHING is Eventual!","I loved ""Everything's Eventual"" and the entire three stars are for the short story. The Screen Savers and games are mediocre at best. My 8 year old nephew was not impressed. Would have preferred the book all by itself."
2,Not One of Her Better Novels,"Normally I love James books but this one let me down.Dalgliesh plays a very small part in it amounting to almostnothing. Instead the investigation was headed by an Insp.Rickards and I didnt gel with him at all. There were too many different people to deal with that it became confusing.I agree, if you want to know a little bit about nuclear power, then this is a great reference on it."
5,An encyclopedia commentary of the Qur'an- surah ali Imran.,"The author has tried to amalgamate the commentaries of the exegetes from the classical periods to the present, thereby providing a one-stop commentary of the Qur'an through Muslim eyes.This is the second volume of the grand intention to present the exegesis of the entire Qur'an.A first in the English language."
1,Don't even think about it.,"I agree with the low stars on this product. When buying this product I thought it was 'all that and a bag of chips'. But after installing it... I found out that it was worth plenty of chips. Please excuse the term... (Buffalo chips) What did I not care for?* The signing agreement. You have to accept that you won't broadcast images over the web.* Images can't be used in public settings. (Are you kidding me? What is the point of buying it then?)* Seeing pagan images. I.e. Santa Claus, Easter Bunny. (Santa Claus and Easter Bunny foolishness distract people from the importance of Christ's birth, death, and resurrection.)The list could go on why I didn't care for this product, and I think I only paid a couple dollars for it at Office Depot.Man! I want my money back."
2,Disappointed in the Quality,"I don't understand why people don't take the time to put out quality work. When I bought this software, I thought I'd be able to use it to make flyers for my church. I looked through it once and have no ideal where I put it since that initial viewing. I was really disappointed with this product."
2,what a disappointment!,"I bought this CD, expecting to get the entire sound track of the movie Mask, and was terribly disappointed to find it didn't include any of the ""songs"" in the soundtrack, only orchestral music! when I buy a sound track, I want the whole package- guess I should have been clued in by the ""score"" rather than ""soundtrack"" notation. from now on, I will read the descriptions more carefully. the orchestral music is nothing special, combined with the songs it would be worth having. I know understand there is a cd available that has only the songs in Mask-- I think it is very underhanded, for them to have separated the two and not more clearly explained what one was NOT getting on the orchestral version."
3,ALMOST didn't fit my bass,"Buyer beware! This bag BARELY fits my upright. I have a Kay M-1 model upright bass. I have to use so much effort to get the zipper to zip up around the shoulder. Everywhere else it fits fine, but its just VERY snug around the shoulder area.Other than that, the bag is great. There is a handle on each side of the bag, and a handle on the front. The bow pocket works very well. There are additional pockets: one in the front, and one large pocket in the back side on the bottom.There are also some shoulder straps to wear your bass like a back pack. I wouldn't recommend using them. First off, the shoulder straps are cheap, and my bass was manufactured in the 50s. I wouldn't want to risk putting un-needed stress on this bass.Overall, great bag if you can be SURE that it will fit your 3/4 bass."
1,I got DUPED!,"This is a first for me. I don't usually buy an item based on a total stranger's opinion and now I know why! This item was a complete waste of my money. I budget myself to only one or two movies per month and unfortunately after reading those reviews I decided to purchase this ridiculous waste of a DVD. I purchased this particular movie for the William Shatner episode. I was led to believe that it was better than the episode in ""The Twilight Zone - Movie"". NOT!! What a joke. All is not lost though...I really enjoyed ""Time enough at last"". I actually felt sorry for the guy."
5,four classics,From the golden years of T.V. we get four classics. William ( Priceline ) Shatner gets high and has a BAD trip. Bigotry and paranoia overtake reason and wrecks a neighborhood. Airplane passengers hit a timeshockwave and see the age of dinosaurs. In these episodes we see how people get into trouble when they fail to use Simple Logic.
3,Review of The Twilight Zone: Vol. 2,"I ordered this particular volume to augment, with video, a story in the literature book from which I teach my students. I knew what to expect from the DVD and was not disappointed. It did arrive sooner than I expected which was a pleasent surprise.Sincerely,B. Stiegelmeyer"
3,good model,shipped in a timely manner definitly budget not all structures detailed by will work for study. Would buy again from this seller!!!!!
2,Nice pieace with problems,"The watch is nice, accurate, the shipment was fast. The only problem was after one week it stopped and I had to replace the battery after 1 week. It is not a reason to send it back, but wasn`t convinient. After the battery change it works perfectly."
3,BEWARE - THIS IS NOT THE NEW FAT FREE YOGA WITH ANA!!!,"Thinking I was saving some money buying ""Used"" I got this DVD thinking it was the remake with Ana. Pretty confusing since Ana is on the cover in the same pose on both!I would give this one 3 1/2 stars actually. I watched it and did it anyway since it was opened.The workout is a good one. Feels effective and Ravi is always great to listen to. But half the reason I get their DVD's is to see Ana.The demonstrator here gamely keeps up and does a good effort. But she obviously not a yoga person and since Ravi does not do the exercise's there is no one to watch for form whick I feel is so important in a yoga DVD!I returned this and am impatiently awaiting the one with Ana(It is the pinkish cover and says new on the cover)"
5,Makes great muffins,"This pan has consistently made great muffins for us, with none of the sticking, burning, or even hassle that our other pans have given us. The fact that they even didn't burn the muffins when I left them in the muffin for a little too long makes them 5 stars in my book."
5,Once again Goldsmith triumphs over mediocrity!,Everytime I listen to this score I forget just how silly the source movie really was. Goldsmith can work musical wonders with any concept and he has graced various quality movies with some of the greatest scores in and out of the SF genre. Anyone interested in collecting good monster movie music needs to have this disc in their collection. Underwater Camp alone is worth the full retail price. I heard that in the theater and knew that I was going to own the soundtrack. Way to go Jerry!
5,Very entertainning!!!,"This original soundtrack of Jerry Goldsmith is one of my favorite soundtrack, the music is so particulary well compose and conduct by the master of the cinema music"
3,"Some of Jerry's good, and not so good","The First and Last tracks are the prizes here. The other 11 worked wonderfully in the film, but outside that context, as background music, don't do very well. Interestingly enough, a track from a Japanese cartoon called ""Record of the Lodoss Wars"" features a track called ""Knight of Lodoss,"" which bears a remarkable similarity to ""A lot Better."" I'm sure it's just coincidence that the cartoon came out a year after ""Leviathan."""
4,Pretty good - a little slow in parts.,"I'm a huge figure skating fan and was curious to read about the story of the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Team. It was interesting, but a little drawn out overall. It really goes into a lot of detail about the skaters' lives which is understandable, but it was a bit of a slow read."
5,The General Kicks All!,"This is a great figure just due to the fact it looks so awesome! I am so happy to add it to my growing Revenge of the Sith action figure collection. It's very popular, but not rare yet. So go get it while you still have a chance!"
2,Fooled by price,"I have seen two versions of this toy. There is an 8"" figure and a small (4""). I thought the price was my guide when I ordered it. I couldn't be at my grandson's birthday so I ordered from Amazon and let the price guide me as to what I wanted. You can't imagine my frustration when two weeks later I asked him to show me my present and he came to me with this small version of the toy. I had paid three times what the toy was worth. I don't think I'll ever again order a present thru Amazon unless I receive it first. I am very sad. Of course I'll buy him the version I intended for him. It only costs $17.00! But I don't think he'll ever forget how I missed his birthday and sent him a cheap small toy."
5,Star Wars General Grievous,"This was one of the figures my grandson NEEDED. I could not find it in any stores, so was very happy to find it available at Amazon. Like all the Star Wars figures, the quality is good. My grandson plays with them for hours.Not to sure that there is any educational value in this toy... however it definately does excercise his imagination.He loves this figure."
5,little mystery,"Some versions of this CD have a cover of Nick Cave's ""Ship Song"" as a B-side. Some versions don't. If you're offering this used, please include a track list! Thank you..."
2,Subject and language for professional readers,"I dislike the book, because it is not that the summary says in terms of a practical approach to every reader"
3,Only general information in this book,"This book offers only general information. It's a good start to get information about concepts used in video editing but is far from offering you in depth information. Although I found some good info, I was relatively disappointed (3 stars), but maybe I had wrong expectations."
4,Poker sets,"The picture showed that the chips had white imprints on them, but they actually came with no white on at all, just solid color. IT made the chips look a little cheap in my opinion. Apart from that, it was solid and packed well. The chips were a good weight and the case was okay."
5,Great Soundtrack.,I don't usually enjoy any movie musical scores much but I've really enjoyed this one. Eric Serra's music easily brings back specific memories from the movie or is even nice to listen to stand-alone. I am a musician myself and this is one of the few soundtracks I'm proud to own. As a fan from the movie and as someone studying film scores. Great buy.
5,A film equalled by the soundtrack,"Eric Serra brings a unique industrial sound to this soundtrack, much like that of another of his work, Goldeneye.If you are a fan of the movie, this album is must. It is a shame however, that Sting's ""Shape of my Heart"" isn't included on the CD. Despite this one shortcoming, one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring record that beautifully brings the emotion of the film to life.Get it now."
4,Tearfully enchanting.,"After seeing the movie, I've ordered it, and the soundtrack online the same day. The movie is astonishing. The music from the movie brings out the tear... I've seen many movies, however this was amazing.*shrugging*. I recommend to listen it with a dolby system or equivalent."
3,"Great game for Mustang Enthusiasts, not for game enthusiats though.","I am a Mustang Enthusiast. So, accordingly, I HAD to buy this game. It's great to see this many beautiful cars in one game. However, as far as game-play is concerned, it could use some work. If you want the perfect car racing game, I suggest something from the Gran Turismo universe. However, if you just want to look at a bunch of Mustangs, and grow bored quickly, this game's for you! Seller was top-notch though. I'd buy from them again."
1,mustang racing,"I wrote a review for this worthless game, but it was not published, it is so bad, I took it to Gamespot and sold it for 2 dollars, the 2nd day after I got it."
5,Good cheezy fun! thank you Cultra/Film Chest for releasing this rare gem!,This is a fun cheesy film!Zaat looks darn good thanks to the great restoration by Cultra/Film Chest.This also has some cool supplimentals as well!This awseome release comes with a BLu-ray and a DVD!Thank you Cultra/Film Chest!
1,"So much potential, no follow through.....","I got suckered in to buying this product after seeing it on television. Actually, I got suckered in to buying THREE of them for my 3 daughters. When I first saw it being advertised I thought WHAT A GREAT IDEA!!!! A HUGE paintbrush you can fill with paint and then use on the driveway. GENIUS! Well, the problem with this product lies in the design. For one, the paint reservoir is about 1/10 the length of this product. So even if used as intended, you would be stuck refilling it pretty much constantly. When you do load the brush, the paint doesn't flow the way it is supposed to. My kids ended up just dipping them in the paint and using them like a regular paintbrush. Oh and the washable paint isn't all that washable---it stained one of my kids' swimsuits. I think this is a product that had a lot of potential but extremely poor follow through....I wish I could get my $30 back! :("
1,Waste of money,"Total waste of money. My daughter absolutely loves to paint. She was so excited go get this. The splatter tip is the only thing we could get to work. Watch out, it splatters everywhere. The plunger is impossible to fill all of the way. The brush tip is useless, paint just oozes off of the end. The sponge tip is impossible to use. By the time you have enough paint in the tip to use it, it too just oozes off the end. We have tried using this two different times with no success."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I gave this one star because there wasn't an option for ZERO stars. We couldn't even get the thing to paint more than one glop at a time. It is next to impossible to fill up the paint chamber and we were never able to get it to even fill up all of the way. It's very frustrating and not worth the time or the money. Do NOT buy this, just stick with plain old side walk chalk."
1,Does not work as advertised,I was very disappointed as were my two grandsons who quickly became frustrated when the paint in the super brush did not flow out as advertised but instead just oozed out to make a big mess. The designers of this toy need to go back to the drawing board...I returned this item the same day I bought it I was so unhappy with it. I do not recommend this to any age.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"What a complete waste of money. In order to get a foot long line of paint on the sidewalk, you need a quarter of the bottle of paint they provide you. After drawing that foot long line you need to unscrew the tip, open the paint bottle, refill the handle (and it takes 3 or 4 plunges of the turkey baster-like handle to get the tiny chamber to fill), screw the tip back on, close the paint and depress the plunger slowly to get the paint into the tip. Go paint another 12 inches, then do it all over again. I can only imagine how much the refills cost. My son agrees that this is going in the trash."
1,HORRRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This paint brush globs out the paint, doesn't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint. We went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it. Not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you can't get the brush in it to suck the paint up. I am so disappointed."
1,Zero Stars should be an option!,"This is the most horrible rip off waste of money product I have ever purchased! I bought 3 of these so my daughter could use the pink, blue and yellow paints. I spent $45 and I'd have done better flushing my money down a toilet! The brushes look like they would hold a lot of paint- there are huge. In reality they only hold maybe a tablespoon of paint. Trust me you'll either be refilling every 10 seconds of just squirt paint in a bowl and let them use it like a regular paint brush. The paint does not easily go onto the sidewalk. i have no idea how crayola was able to create the drawings in their commercial. No child on the planet no matter how gifted could have done them using these tools."
1,Waste of Money,This is not a very fun toy. My [...] got tired of filling the paint chamber because it would empty so quickly. He also ended up dipping the brush into the paint jars. He went through both jars of paint in under 10 minutes and was finished with the toy. There wasn't enough paint to even create a picture. The Happy Birthday pic on the back of the package must've taken over 20 bottles and a very skilled artist. I think Crayola should stick to making crayons.
1,Not what I expected.,"I bought the toy thinking my girls would love it. First off it took in more paint when you filled it. Once you filled the attachment all the paint in the compartment was gone, and therewas not enough paint to draw with and then you had to refill just to try and draw again. It would take entirly to much paint to make any of the pictures advertised. My oldest which is 9 years old said it was aggrevating becasue she had to keep refilling the brush."
4,Twisted,"The playability isnt great, but the theme is truly original and the laughs are non-stop. This is a sure-fire way to have fun with a first person shooter."
2,Yawn,"This one is not worth your time. I gave it 2 stars only because I have actually seen worse movies. I thought the combination of Ryan and Banderas would be good but I was proven wrong. Ryan's acting was so contrived and it was painful to watch her collagen-enhanced lip any time she smiled. I agree with other reviewers that the plot was really unbelievable but that is OK if the movie is entertaining. Unfortunately, this one was not. It dragged and I actually grabbed my laptop to play some mindless solitaire while watching the second half of the movie. Even the ""twist"" ending was obvious throughout. Meg Ryan definitely did not live up to her work in other movies and, quite frankly, she tried way too hard to be cutesie. Thank goodness I only rented this one but it leaves me with $5 I'd like to have back and, more importantly, 90 minutes of my life as well."
1,Horrible,"Colin Hanks has Tom Hanks' voice, so it's strange hearing that voice but seeing a completely different body. I don't know whose face Meg Ryan has now, but it's not hers. The plot was stupid."
3,Not a bad movie,"I did enjoy this, had some funny moments. I liked where his friends in the FBI were joking with him about his mother."
3,Not bad a little predictable,I love movies and this was a pretty good premise but a little predictable. Not a bad rental for a cheaper price.
3,ENTERTAINING,I DID ENJOY THIS MOVIE. IF YOU ARE AN ANTONIO BANDERAS FAN YOU WILL ENJOY WATCHING HIS CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE
1,one to miss,Wasn't good at all - very boring - tried to watch it 2 times and it was so dumb I had to skip to the end.
5,Brilliant documentary,"Ask a cinematographer about his work and what do you get? Poetry. This is a wonderful, informative, engaging documentary. It is composed exclusively of interviews with 110 world-class cinematographers. Yes, these are the people who shot your favorite movies of the last 45 years. They designed the lighting, style, composition, and camera movement, in collaboration with the director and the rest of the team. It is particularly engaging in that we feel there is complete trust of the person doing the interviews. He's a cinematographer also. Then, the Editing style is a brilliant word and theme association game. You also grasp the mythic, affirmative element of how knowledge is passed on through the generosity of the masters. Congrats to Jon Fauer. Okay, I'm going to go watch it again."
5,The Elementals,"If you read horror, this is hands down one of the best, scariest, and most original books you will ever come across. I read it when I was 17, and I'm 34 now, and still get the chills just thinking about it. I cannot recommend this book enough. Please read it, you'll not want to miss out on this one!"
1,Disappointment,"I've heard so many good things about this book. My mouth is watering in anticipation on reading it. Supposed to be a heck of a good read...Unfortunately, I can't say anything either way, because I haven't received it yet. The shipper, ThriftBooks, messed up my order. What was supposed to have been delivered between October 23rd and November 9th, hasn't been. I've emailed them twice, and gotten the run-around.If you're planning to order anything from ThriftBooks, I strongly urge you to reconsider. They've been no help at all in finding my order, which has obviously been lost. We are doing the legwork in searching for this book ourselves. If only I had been fore-warned..."
5,McDowell wrote the scariest books I've ever read.,"When I was in high school all I read were horror novels. I read everything that came down the pike and therefore became jaded and hard to impress. Mr. McDowell wrote the scariest, creep-inducing books I've ever read. Yes, even scarier than Mr. King. Thankfully I saved my copies of the Blackwater series. Sadly I did not save my copies of 'The Elementals' or 'The Amulet' which isn't even listed by Amazon. Mr. McDowell wrote Southern Gothic at its absolute best. I urge anyone who can find his books to read them and anyone who has the authority to put them back into print to do so."
3,Really confusing sizing.,"A lot of others had issues with the sizing of these pants, so I made sure to carefully read everything & then measure. I got what I thought was correct, but when they arrived, they looked like you could fit 2 of me in them - HUGE.I love the pants though, so am exchanging for a smaller size. The print is really cool looking, and they seem to be pretty durable. The price is right also.I have been searching high & low for pants like this - I don't carry a purse, and I need lots of pockets for work. With the advent of ""skinny jeans"" & ""jeggings"" it's really hard to find ""normal people"" pants. (meaning, I'm over 35, so I refuse to wear those types of pants... I think they look horrible on everyone.)"
5,Awesome,These pants are awesome! Size chart was dead on ! Pants fit right and very comfortable ! Great buy for the money you won't find any cheaper that are better than these
3,was difficult to determine what size to order.,"The sizing states s, m, l or xl. Hard to determine what size to choose because it did not give waist sizes nor inseams. thankfully I chose the correct size. the tag states the inseam went up to 32 inches. I needed a 34 inch inseam but it did fit. My husband loves the pants! they are quality made. Just need to be clearer on the sizing."
4,Great album by a Great Artist!,"This is classic Gary Chapman! Songs like ""Breakin' Hearts"", ""Love Like Blood"", and ""Love That Girl"", are as exciting to listen to now as the first time I heard them in 1988. God bless you Gary! Thanks for cranking out awesome songs!"
3,Not as good as The Most Hated Family in America,"""Fall from Grace"" is a 70-minute documentary about the infamous Westboro Baptist Church. The church was also depicted by Louis Theroux in ""The Most Hated Family in America"". Theroux succeeded in getting close to the family in a way that ""Fall from Grace"" doesn't. What ""Fall from Grace"" does that Theroux failed to do is interview some of the Phelps children who's left the church. This offers a new perspective on the church although the interviews were brief and done over the phone. ""Fall from Grace"" also includes interviews with some people of the Topeka community, including the mayor, police chief and a lawyer. On the whole, though, Fall from Grace is less successful and feels more shallow than Theroux's film and having seen that one, this didn't offer much new info, apart from the interviews with the children who left (most of which I already knew after reading Nate Phelps story online)."
5,Preschool Teachers Must Have,"I bought a few fairy tale books from this collection. They have just the right amount of words for preschoolers/kindergartners. I told some parts in my own words, but the kids LOVED these stories and really caught on. Must have this classic in your collection!"
4,Good story.,"This is a good book, the kids seem to like it, but it is not told in thesame manner as the one I remember as a child."
3,"Despite album title, doesn't get too far off the ground","Obscure old-school rapper KC Flightt (real name Frank Toson) took somewhat of a different approach to making this album than many late 80s/early 90s rappers did with their albums, incorporating jazz and house undertones into his sound. Technically, this is a good idea if you want your rap music to be catchy and listenable, but this album is still far from brilliant. Hints of jazz and house music generally gives rap a cool vibe, but KC Flightt is hardly a great rapper, and the jazz-house formula sounds stale, uninspired, and repetitive on this particular album."
1,Cheap Material,Upon receiving this skirt I immediately returned it. The material was not what I expected....it felt cheap and was clinging when I tried on the skirt.
1,Caligula the Untold Story,"Very poorly done, the quality of the product is inferior. The color is atrocious, the camera work is very substandard. The whole film is worse than second rate, and not worth your time or money."
3,Laura Gemser,I love Laura Gemser. If you know her please email me at charlx@dbzmail.com and tell me more about this georgeous actress. She is the best and this film proves it...........give us more.
4,Happy with press,"Love this item. So much more convenient than the gun style. My only wishes is that it wasnt so noisy. Also, keep extra batteries, as mine died during the second spritz cookie batch."
1,Bad Purchase,"Had a manual press and top flew off each time I pressed out a cookie so upgraded to an electric one. What a mistake. The thing had no power, took forever to reverse and the cookies were teeny. It took me two hours to get little tiny cookies. I'll look for a good quality hand press next time. This was absolute JUNK!"
1,My Cookie Press Depressed Me,The experience we had with the Wilton Battery-Operated Cookie Press was depressing. We actually bought this mechanical marvel twice thinking there was something wrong with us the first time. Never did we go through so much for so little.The motor died after half-a-batch of cookies (each time) and we resorted to manually pushing the cookie stem up and down. It got so laborious that in frustration we started eating the raw cookie dough. We thank all of the other reviewers for restoring our self-confidence by sharing their similar experiences.
1,Don't waste your time!!,"This cookie press sucks, plain as that. I should have read all the reviews before buying this product, but I bought this in a store not at Amazon. I was curious as to what the reviews would be about this product since I was having so much trouble and low and behold everyone has had the same problem. I thought it was something I was doing wrong I wasn't and neither are you if your here, the product just is not up to par. The only reason for a 1 star is that there are no 0's"
1,Worthless battery guzzling junk!,"Got this just before Christmas because my original Wilton was lost in a move. I was so excited to think of making cookies in less time. Turns out that I spent more time trying to get the thing working and once I did ran out of battery power before getting half way through one batch. Finally ended up getting a cheapy for $15 and that saved the day. Still in the market for something faster, but would never recommend this to anyone! Save your money and go old fashioned."
1,not up to the job at all,"A great disappointment -- awkward to hold, and it's totally unable to push out dough from recipes I've used for years with my old electric cookie press that finally died. I wish I could find another like it. Forget this one - get a manual one if you have to. This is a waste of time and money."
5,shocked at bad reviews!,"I have had this press for 2 years and wanted to buy another one for a family member as a gift so I hopped onto amazon.com. I just read many of the reviews and I am shocked at all the bad reviews. This press is the best press I've ever used! My grandmother had a 'by hand press' and I had the hardest time using it. I have hunted for a good press- one that works the first time, every time and this one is IT! I am not coordinated at all and found it so easy to make great cookies. Don't let the negative reviews deter you- buy this press :)"
1,Almost Worthless,"This little press had no power to push the cookie dough through the templates. At first I figured my batteries were dead, but after 3 changes, clearly the problem is with the product. I will not attempt to use this again, I feel like my mother wasted money in getting it for me as a gift. The only redeeming quality is the fact that I can use the metal templates to press designs into the dough before baking, which I only did because I wanted to get SOME use out of this product. You do get some good recipes, but I'm sure you could find all of them elsewhere. Totally not worth it."
1,Beware,This machine is not strong enough to push the dough through and it stops. I would not recomend this unit to anyone.
1,Wish 0 stars was an option,"Spent two hours trying to get the thing to force out any dough. I got half a batch done and needed a break. My hand hurt from pushing the button! While resting and muttering curses, my wonderful husband tried it. He gave it about two minutes before he took it apart, washed it and took it right back to the store. What a waste. He came back with a much cheaper, manual cookie press. Thirty minutes after he got home, we enjoyed our cookies."
1,Item is a Piece of Junk!,"** DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM ** It's a piece of junk. I bought this cookie press having fond memories as a child making Christmas cookies with my mother. At that time my mother had an electric cookie press. I thought this cookie press would be better since it was battery operated and we wouldn't have to deal with the cord. I even purchased rechargeable batteries thinking I might go through a few batteries making the cookies. Well, the batteries don't give the press enough power as an electric version. I even tried regular batteries to see if they would give it more power. I frosted about 18 cupcakes before the batteries went completely dead. I am returning this item as it is a piece of junk. I don't even know why Wilton would put out this product with their name on it. Now I will think twice before I buy any Wilton product. The item is even difficult to hold. I will now search the web for an electric cookie press."
1,Not worth it!,"I bought this hoping I wouldn't have to fight the cord like on my old one and was completely disappointed! It could not push the dough out of the tube, I even tried thinner doughs and it still had a huge problem. It was strained the whole time, like the batteries weren't enough (they were new batteries)! I thought it was going to cause damage to the mechanics of it! I quickly switched back to my corded one so I could enjoy making cookies instead of regretting it! I would not recommend this to anyone! Good idea, poor product!"
1,Terrible- Died on me,I have struggled with this from day one. It burnt out using a recipe that came with the box. Very disappointed and also mad that all of this dough will go to waste. I would love my money back.
1,Wilton Cookie Master Plus cookie press,"This cookie press could not accommodate the Spritz cookies I have been making for years with another electric press I was using. I thought the dough was too chilled the first attempt, so I waited till the dough was at room temperature and it still wouldn't allow the cookie dough to come out. Maybe the battery power is not strong enough? I returned this item and went back to my 30 year old electric press handed down from my grandmother."
1,Put your earplugs in!,"This thing is the pits! I was so excited because my neighbor found this for me after my regular Wilton cookie press broke after only 2 trays of trees...I must be cursed! Well this made a horrible noise from the start as it slllllloooowwwwlllly wound the plunger up, and then even more of one when I put the dough in and it tried to push the dough through the Christmas tree disk. Then it just died, won't push the dough through. It still worked to wound the plunger up, just not any power to push dough through disk. The batteries were new. The dough wasn't hard. So I wouldn't recommend so far this cookie press or the basic model either. Looks like I'm a quest. Good luck....BTW, not good either if you have carpal tunnel, with how long I was holding the button to get the plunger to even move to the dough I can see that it would take forever to do a tray of cookies...my hand was getting numb from that little bit!"
3,Wilton Cookie Press,I bought this as a Christmas present. The first one I had to send back because it was wired backwards but company immediately rectified it and sent another one overnight. Company was very professional and will buy from again. My dauhter used product once for cookie dough and it was ok. The immpression disks didn't really give a good shape as she thought but I plan on using to see if it just was the consistency of the dough. The motor is strong on this and definately works well in pushing the dough out. Very useful for those who cannot work alot with their hands.
3,Wilton cookies Master Plus Cookie Press,"It ok for small batches, but very slow for large batches of cookies and crackers. Needs a more speedier motor."
2,No power,"Love the cordless idea, but this machine did not have enough power to make one batch of cookies. Not sure if the one that I received was defective or if all a bad make. Read other reviews and some were satisfied with it..."
1,Disappointed,"The first one I bought didn't work at all. The second one didn't make it through my first batch of cookies. I made the recipe in the booklet and used "" the black and copper batteries"", not cheap ones. The motor was grinding before I was 1/2 way done."
1,A Waste of Money,"This is a piece of junk! It does not have the power to push even the softest dough out. I actually tried two, the first one would only go in reverse, so Amazon sent another the next day. It will go forward and reverse, but it stopped as soon as it touched the dough....this is a totally worthless product and I was wrong to not look at these reviews. Hopefully, I can get my money back."
1,ZERO Star Rating for Wilton's Cookie Master Plus Cordless Cookie Press,"This cookie gadget has no power at all. I tried replacing batteries and it still moved like a slug--and based on these reviews, this seems to be the biggest issue with this device. What a disappointment. In addition, it is way overpriced. If you absolutely want one of these, I would stick to their manually operated cookie press contraption.I suggest you research before you run out and assume Wilton is the only one out there--Wilton is definitely spending more on their advertisement then on their products lately.[...][...][...]Hope this review was helpful!"
2,Not As Easy As Promised,"This is the third Wilton cookie press I have bought. A lesser one cracked on me and I lost an important piece from the one I bought to replace it. I bought this one with high hopes, only to be disappointed. I agree with the first two semi-negative reviews - it was not easy to use, and took me much longer to make my first few batches of spritz cookies - the button is hard to push and the entire process was very time-consuming and frustrating, I almost gave up. I finally got it to work, but overall, I was underwhelmed."
1,Spritz cookies,"I received this cookie press a few years ago as a gift but hadn't gotten around to using it until this Christmas. Since it was my first time using it I decided to use the recipe for spritz cookies that comes in the package. I got the thing all cleaned up and put in brand new batteries. Then I made the dough per the directions. Then I attempted to use the thing. I found button was easy enough to press, and the directions were pretty clear, however, the dough would not release from the press onto my pan. I tried releasing it onto waxed paper, that didn't work any better. I tried switching to a different plate, no luck. Finally after playing around for an hour I pitched the dough. I'm not sure if it works for appetizers but I would NOT recommend this press for making spritz cookies."
1,Piece of JUNK,"This is horrible.....as stated by the other reviews!!! Do NOT waste your money or time!!! My husband and I tried for several hours to get this to work, we let the dough come to room temperature, and still it would NOT work!!"
1,Defective Product,"I was very disappointed with the Cookie Maker Plus and I believe I bought a defective product. The picture on the front of the box shows the person's hand on the big button to make cookies, I had to use the small button at the top to get it to work and the big button to retract the plunger. I have used the Cookie Maker Plus 4 times... twice to make twice baked potatoes, once to make candy but the 4th time I used their recipe for Classic Spritz Cookies the machine died after 16 cookies. I switched the batteries and it produced 2 more cookies , then died again. I finished the batch by rolling them out and using a cookie cutter. The Cookie Master Plus could use major inprovement. Don't waste your money."
1,Very disappointing,Had no power and wouldn't push the cookie dough out. I will try it one more time but wish I had saved my money.
1,I wouldn't buy this again.,Purchased this as a gift. It is underpowered. Does not push the dough like it should. It was a waste of money.
5,Copper bracelets really work!,My arthritis has stopped aching now that I am wearing this amazing bracelet. I have since given two away to friends with similar problems with their aching joints.
5,Great,"I'm pregnant and retaining a lot of water. The magnets in this pretty bracelet has helped keep my swelling in my legs and feet down. On the days I forget to put them on, I have a significant increase in the swelling."
3,"Nice score, CD way to short!","I was in Wal-Mart and I saw Pacific Heights DVD for 5 bucks so I bought it, enjoyed the movie, enjoyed the score(love Zimmers work, The Rock, Broken Arrow,). Soon after seeing the movie I bought the soundtrack, First Track: begins with a Broken Arrow type theme then goes in to Micheal Keaton's sax theme, good track. Second Track: the piano is played for about 2 minutes and then this is where it gets good, the Broken Arrow type theme is played again in all its glory, and Keatons theme plays with a few beats and vocals. The other tracks aren't as good lack themes, lack every thing that made the other track great. Now heres the draw back, the CD is 36 minutes long!. If your a Hans Zimmer get it anyway. Nice score, CD way to short."
2,More textbook than instructional aide,This is an interestig history book but does not give any help to a current director who is directing a Jewish oriented play and is not knowledgeable of the ethnic subtleties
2,Not for Journaling,"After using two of the beautiful Book of Kells series as journals, I began the third and was quickly disappointed. The first two were excellent; in the other two, the paper is too hard to take ink. The books are much better suited as a platform for scrap-booking, where items are pasted in. Forget about writing in these unless you check them before hand."
4,Candy molds,"I got these molds to make for my daughters baby shower, they were adorable and made great shower favors.Very reasonable price"
3,Not my cup of tea,"Bought this book recommended by a friend. Got halfway through, found it rather interesting but not captivating. Will donate to local library. Find the cover in bad taste, disturbing. Parcel arrived in excellent condition and on time."
5,Phenomenal Combine,"This Combine is phenomenal! It's my first large scale Technic and I had so much fun putting it together. It's so cool, because you can see how all the parts work together to make the combine operational. I'm from a farming family and even my older friends thought it was awesome! All the engineers who work with my mom wanted to take it home and put it together!Awesome product!! Way to go Lego (from my Mom!) -- Farm Boy"
5,"Treasure, fierce Vikings, and a secret elf civilization","Written for young readers ages 8 to 12, The Adventures Of Young Santa is an action/adventure novel of a young man who becomes a reluctant hero in an age of sword fighting, dank castles, hidden treasure, fierce Vikings, and a secret elf civilization.

4,Worth it,These glasses are worth the money. We have these and the 14 oz. size. Substantial and pretty.
5,supergreat book,This book out of Columbia thinks about electronics and electronics engineering the way one should think. It is very physical but also mathematically imaginative.
5,This Album is Incredible!,"This album rocks. It is such a great combination of raw sausage; slower, smoother tracks; and everything in between that I can't stop loving it! I guarentee you won't be disappointed with this album.....I haven't taken it out of the CD player in my car for months! The songs have great, powerful lyrics that are expertly written by the leader Cosmos, who is a true poet. Check out especially ""Ghetto Mind"" and ""WITTR."" The last track on the album, ""Farewell,"" is an unexpected gem, the way it contrasts with the faster songs on the album. It is intensely beautiful and not to be missed. Great job, too, with covering a song by a very influential group (Black Sabbath, ""Electric Funeral"") and not only making it sound amazing, but also with making it their own.Great Album, trust me, you will love it....."
2,Bad text book for beginners,The book seems to assume you've read ahead and know something about the future topics in the very beginning. I often found myself frustrated and scratching my head at some explanations. Many of the explanations could be worded / phrased better. I ended up using the book and accompanying online lecture notes by Rabaey as a reference all the time.
5,Well made good fit,This product is wonderful.-Has a small adjuster string for those who need a little tighter or looser fit.-Stylish design and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.-Absolutely perfect for fall and early spring. Not so much for summer as it does insulate the head quite well.
2,horrible,"dont buy it. poor quality. uncomfortable, way to small, bad looking-looks nothing like the displayed."
2,small,it did not fit my head. very small. but it seemed to be made well. but i think it is meant for a young girl such as ages like 9-14? idk.
5,"""Buddha"" Series Hits Its Stride In Vol. 5","This volume of legendary Japanese cartoonist Osama Tezuka is a masterpiece, reaching peak drama; the parallel stories all converge fully in a dramatic encounter. His detailed black and white drawings are moving, vivid and cinematic. He narrates with great wisdom, depth and comedy.This volume is the most exciting and fast-paced of them all so far. As Tezuka builds toward the climax of the story with his lesser story threads, he subtly explores Buddhist precepts. He tugs at our emotions; surely the cycle of violence can be stopped - or can it?What is remarkable is he is able to do this while entertaining; as readers, we become spellbound by his picture-perfect drawings. Even if you are not a fan of Japanese manga or Buddhism try this one; Tezuka may win you over."
5,Masterful,"This is my second Therion CD, my first was Secret Of the Runes. Therion is a very unique metal ""band"", and this album really captures the full energy of Therion. It is hard to describe the music on this CD, because some songs are slow, melodic, with a blend of classical and power metal vocals. Some other songs have a very Death Metal feeling to them.The second CD is the best in my opion. Mega Therion starts out with some well composed orchestral music, and then they go into one of the most unique metal songs I've heard. The last song is especially powerful, going all out with power chords and loud and powerful vocals. It sounds like something right out of a Viking war movie. If you are a metal fan, pick up this album, you will not be dissapointed."
1,Arrived broken - twice,We like this set (we have the basic set and it has been durable) but it arrived cracked not just once but twice. Buy it in person.
1,Terrible Vacuum,"We bought this vacuum less than a year ago, and since then, we've had to unclog it almost every time we have a substantial mess to clean up. The attachments constantly fall off the side, and it's very difficult to keep the machine clean for long. It's absolutely terrible, and I don't recommend buying it."
1,Slightly better than a broom,"Even though it has a ""bare floor"" setting, this vacuum is virtually worthless on bare floors. Try vacuuming in bare feet and you can literally feel this thing shoot dirt all over the room.The telescoping duster (a $20 value!) is great for playing with your kid or your cat. Beyond that it pretty much just gets in the way and won't stay in its holder.Finally the height adjustment thingie is held on by a single little spring. If you happen to catch the edge of a rug while vacuuming, it will stretch this spring and render the whole vacuum useless. (This happened to me.)At any rate, I got one warranty replacement within 90 days and then gave it away. I can't see wasting any more time or effort on this poorly made vacuum."
1,Is any vacuum worth it?,"Yuck! I wish I could find a vacuum that lasted longer than a few months at my house. I find I breathe in more dust when I vacuum with this machine. And, I'm totally sick of fixing the roller and ""ever-slipping"", ""smoking"" belt. Stay clear of this one, ladies. Signed, mother of five"
1,"GARBAGE, GARBAGE, GARBAGE","I bought this vacuume thinking it was a great deal. Boy was I wrong!!! It lasted about 2 months and wont suck anything up. I have taken this crap apart and found no clogs. The attachments fall off all the time too!!!! Do yourself a favor and pass on this. I would rather sweep the carpet, it would do a better job!"
3,Disappointed with this vac...,"I've owned this vac for several months now. Although it works fine while vacuuming as an upright, because I have hardwoods and a lot of small areas in my home I use the hose/attachments frequently and find this vacuum to be really awkward for using those. The stretchy part of the hose is too short and also attached at an awkward angle to the vac.I also find that I spend a lot of time sticking the ""telescoping duster"" back into its side-carriage thingy because it's always coming loose. I often will just take it out altogether. Also, as others have mentioned the canister is a bit small.I gave this three stars because it does a pretty good job picking up dirt and dust; it's just the unit is not as comfortable or as easy to use as I'd hoped. Generally, though, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
1,Complete piece of crap and waste of money,"This vacuum never worked. It was on sale at Target and I bought it for the cheap price, and got what I paid for. The ""power paw"" upholstery attachment doesn't work by design. The duster just moves dust around without picking it up. The hose works but is a royal pain to use and has no reach. The brush just throws things back out behind the vacuum cleaner, and it just won't pick anything up. It does a great job of putting a lot of dust in the air and all over itself while it's running, though. Complete crap. Don't even touch it. I'll say ""Eureka!"" when I see a Eureka that picks up debris off the floor."
1,Horrible with hair and sand,"This has been a horrible vacuum and a waste of hard earned money. Hair gets wrapped around the spinning brush and it ceases to spin. It must be taken apart before each usage to get the brush to spin. While vacuuming, I can feel it kicking dirt back at my toes that it won't pick up. I have pets and place high demand on a vacuum, and this one failed me miserably."
1,useless.,I experience the same issues as everyone else. As I vacuum I can feel the dirt getting blown out the back onto my feet. Don't even think about using powder odor eliminator on the carpet. It gets stuck on the foam filter and then everything goes downhill from there. I just spent 20 dollars buying new filters when I should have saved the money and bought a new vac.
1,Piece of Junk,"This is the only vacuum I have ever known to leave a floor dirtier than when I started. I am not joking, and this is no exageration. After the first use, dirt gets sweeped by the brushes and flies strait out the back end onto the floor. The entire front end gets covered with dust, and you can literally see dust flying in the air. I suppose it might work better if you take the time before each use to clean all 3 filters and make sure the ""easy empty cup"" is empty. Don't do this inside your house, or you will have dust flying thoughout the air, that you will have to dust up. The ""power paw"" is a joke, and the ""telescopic self cleaning duster"" is a gimmick. You have been warned. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK"
1,Horrible Vacume DO NOT BUY,"This vacume is rediculouse. I have had it for less than a year and have replaced the belt twice, it is constantly getting clogged and it doesnt clean worth anything. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUME. I hate it and regret buying it and of coarse Eureka's customer service is horrible, so spend the money to get a Dyson"
1,cheap vacuum for cheap price.,i have had this vacuum for two months now...the first time i used it...it was ok.. right after the first time of using it i had to unclog the hose and take the whole vacuum apart...and have been taking it apart since then just to unclog it ...i am really thinking about just getting a dyson since i have heard nothing but good things about them...i guess its true if you want something good you are just going to have to spend more on it...i wouldnt recommend this vacuum to anyone...
2,Waste of money!,"I wish I had done more research before buying this vacuum. It worked great at first, but less than a year after purchasing it, mine is broken. First the hose attachment lost suction, now the whole thing burns, fumes, and spits dirt back out when I try to use it. I thought maybe I just got a lemon, but after seeing the other reviews on here, it appears as though this is just a poorly made vacuum. What's most upsetting is the price tag, as it was definitely *not* worth $100 for only a year's worth of performance."
1,not good,"Had to replace the belt about 2 weeks into owning it and just thought belts wore out easily. Well, I've had the machine three years now and the belt that i put on it to replace the original still works fine. I agree, too many filters. I have replaced the pricey front filter three times already and it is impossible to find at local stores now so I am left having to order one online. I have a small dog with long hair and i have to take the front off and pull discusting hair wads out of the top each time I vacuum. Looking forward to buying a new vacuum cleaner soon... and it won't be a Eureka."
1,"Does Not Suck, It Spits!",This vacuum gave me the same problem it gave a lot of the other reviewers. As I would vacuum an area and move away I would notice the vacuum had spit out dust and dirt on the area I just vacuumed. Who in the Eureka Research and Development signed off on this turd? They had no right releasing this reject on the market. This is my first Eureka product and will be the last. They deserve to lose their market share and should have their entire executive and management structure overhauled for this oversight. If they let this piece of crap out the door then what else have they unleashed on the buying public?
1,"Selling this model should be illegal, Eureka.","Ok, I'll say it: how DARE a company sell a product like this? It's as if I set up a lemonade stand, took money, then gave my hot and sweaty customers empty cups...no, wait. It's more like dumping the cup of lemonade on their head and walking away with their money.Where is the recall on this item? I thought I bought a dud 2 years ago, but after happening upon these reviews and wondering if it's the same model, I cannot believe how each of the reviews mirrors my experience EXACTLY. Sometimes this horrible hunk of garbage would spew objects onto my feet so fast, it left marks!I was about to buy another Eureka. They are now on my boycott list.You should be ashamed of this practice and this tragedy of a product, Eureka. You do not deserve another dollar from me."
2,Lost suction over the course of one year,"At first, we loved this vac. However, it gradually lost suction. The tools are stored in an awkward position on the unit. Some fall off during use. It was a disappointment overall. Ready for a replacement."
1,Makes more of a mess than it cleans!,"Ugh!!! This vacuum sucks...or rather doesn't suck! The first few times I used it, it seemed to work okay, though it was not effective on our hardwood floors. It has only gotten worse...Now, rather than sucking up dirt, it just spits it back out spraying dirt in ALL directions. I am now searching for a new vacuum cleaner after having this one for just a few months!Do not buy this vacuum...unless you enjoy purchasing a new one every few months!"
1,Total waste of money,"This is the worst vacuum I've ever owned. As stated in many other reviews, it spits dirt out everywhere. When I turn it off and move it, there is always dirt where the vacuum was standing. The dirt cup is easy to remove, but once removed the space it occupies has dirt dumped into it from whatever parts are above the area. Also, I ALWAYS have to stick my hand up into the area above the dirt cup and pull out gobs of trash lodged there. The vacuum itself is filthy from the dirt/dust it spews everywhere. The cord is difficult to wrap around the holder - it constantly pops loose. The dust wand is useless and won't even stay in place. A vacuum should be a simple piece of equipment that doesn't require constant maintenance, and this one doesn't even come close."
1,"Too much effort, not enough suction","I have seen the Dyson commercials, and I thought a ""bagless"" vac sounded great: better suction, and no changing a bag.But here's the problem with the Altima. Instead of using the bag as a filter, it has two separate filters, both of which must be cleaned to get any real suction.That makes it a lot more complicated, not simpler as I'd hoped. Instead of opening the front and changing a bag, you're taking the thing apart in two places, emptying the canister (which is simply messier than changing a bag), and cleaning two filters. And you have to do all this outside, even in January, or you're just putting dust back into your house. And unless both filters are cleaned every time you use it, the thing just kicks up more dust than it picks up.So, it's just waaaay more effort than it's worth, to me. I'm not a big Amazon reviewer, but this one is bad enough to merit my time.Oh, and the duster attachment just doesn't work."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I have to admit the first time I used this sweeper it was awesome! I couldn't believe the amount of dirt it picked up (we don't have pets so I don't have that issue). The 2nd time I used it there wasn't nearly the dirt in it but I thought maybe it was because it got so much up the first time. By the 2nd use I had to clean the filter out real good which is kind of a hassle but this is my first bagless sweeper so I figure it comes with having a bagless (still not sure about that). Well today I used it for the 3rd time. I finished sweeping 4 bedrooms, living room and family room and there is no dirt in the canister.....where the heck is it going you ask....it's spitting it all back out. The sweeper is absolutely filthy on the outside from all the dust it's creating. I've checked all the filters and they are all clean. This hunk of junk is going back to the store."
1,Hate it,I wish I could give this less than one star. It stinks. I spend more time cleaning out the clogs and various filters than I actually do cleaning the carpet.
1,Worst vacuum I've ever had,"This vacuum sucks...and not in a good way. No wonder it was on clearance at Target.I have short carpet in my bedrooms, pergo in the hallway and living room, and ceramic tile in the kitchens and bathrooms. On ALL of these surfaces, it just moves the dirt around. The brush seems to be way too powerful, and it just shoots everything out instead of picking it up. I ended up buying a broom for my bare floors. I wish I could take this peice of junk back. Oh and the ""power paw"" is pretty useless as well. And this vacuum is obnoxiously heavy. Not worth the money at all."
1,Yawn!,"I can't believe that this is a BBC product! ""The Miracles of Jesus"" is incredibly repetitious and -- hard to believe given the subject -- BORING! Moreover, through its intellectual dishonesty, this film actually undermines faith."
1,Clever but not convincing,"This docudrama has been designed to attract the non-believer and then slowly convince you of the truth of Jesus' miracles. However, it becomes apparent that this docudrama is not impartial at all but has been created by believers of the miracles. The explanations are pretty flimsy and predictable. There is certainly no verifiable evidence submitted."
1,"Truly, truly I say to you...","Truly, truly I say to you, this dvd stinks. I thought it was movie, but it's all about this magician who downplays the miracles of Jesus. He calls himself a Christian Illusionist and compares his magic to what Jesus was able to do. He trys to make you think that it was possible for Jesus to have used trickery and sets a stage to put doubt in your heart. No Christian would do that. I dislike this dvd so much that I will be throwing it in the trash where it belongs."
4,Good product,I have used this product before and think it is effective in rinsing and sterilizing my dogs mouth. He is a 10 year old Yorke-Maltese mix and their teeth get bad at that age. The shipping was bit expensive for this product.
3,Nothing yet.,"I have been using this for a couple of weeks (not very long) but I haven't seen any results yet. The reason for the three stars is that I am hopeful that it will work and my dog, who has become extremely sensitive to anything regarding his teeth, does not mind this treatment at all."
5,Clone trooper well worth the ca$h,"Reguardless of what I write this figure will end up being one of the hard to find figures of the ROTS line. Overall I like the idea of giving the figures some good articulation. As compared to some others offered in the same line. The ""quick draw action"" leaves a little to be desired but for kids it will be great. In any respect it's well worth the (...)"
2,A step backward,"Except for most of the Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego chapters, which show evidence of capable research and writing, this is a step backward from the previous edition. The coverage of northwestern Argentina is superficial and even naive, and the coverage of Iguazu falls missed the enormous changes that resulted from privatization of national park services over the past few years. It looks as if only one, perhaps two, of the five authors was really up to the job."
4,Roomy and comfortable,"As usual with Coleman it is very thoughtfully constructed. Continuous pole sleeves make inserting and removing the poles easier but the tension of the poles could be tighter, an easy adjustment. The hinged/poled door is fabulous and the fly design allows air circulation even when it is raining. It is heavy to transport. It did take a bit longer to set up the first time. I have now set it up numerous times all by myself and can get it up in about 30-45 minutes. I recently weathered a major storm with wind, rain and even small hail and stayed dry and comfy because I took the time to locate it properly, stake it completely, and fasten all velcro. After seeing my fabulous new tent a number of my friends got one for themselves! We now have a Tucana village at our campouts."
5,Best tent...ever,This tent has been the easiest tent to setup that I have owned. My wife and I set it up in less than 30 minutes. Either one of us could have easily done it on our own. It's spacious enough for our large family. Love the door. Very good overall tent.
4,Its a Tent,It is a decent tent. Not the best nor the worst. Could use some seem sealer at the factory thats for sure.
2,Not all sponges the same,"I used to be able to get a sisal sponge at the local Albertsons/Sav-On for less than $2. It would hold up for 1-2 months before starting to lose its texture as opposed to loofahs that I usually only get 2-3 weeks out of. But they stopped carrying them in the store and I've been trying to find the same thing online.This scrubber looks the same and the sisal fiber weave has the rough texture I like. However the actual sponge inside is sub-par. After only one use, the sponge has lost a quarter of its volume and its shape.I'll try a different manufacture next time."
4,"Before There was Conan, There was Kull...","For Robert E. Howard neophytes, a little background. REH created Kull prior to Conan, but had difficulty seling his stories. What few there are were sometimes far more involved and intricately plotted than the typical Conan tale. Since they didn't sell, REH came up with Conan and a few of Kull's tale actully were transformed into Conan stories.One of those was ""By This Axe I Rule,"" which was loosely adapted to become ""The Phoenix on the Sword,"" as I recall. Some people actually prefer the character of Kull to Conan. Regardless, Kull is a worthwhile and enjoyable read."
3,Can't Say Why I Don't Like It,"There is nothing I can pinpoint that is bad about Frogpond, I just don't like them. They make fairly standard alt chick rock like the Breeders or Throwing Muses. Fans of such like-minded bands will probably like Frogpond as well."
4,For the Japaense archaeologist,"While not all of the articles in this book are of interest to me, most are on topic and well written. You won't find the majority of them or even these topics discussed elsewhere in English. I also highly value the glossary of Japanese archaeological and specialized terms at the end of the book. It's been a very useful book to me as an East Asian archaeologist, though I would hesitate to recommend it to a layman."
1,Very poor quality plus an audible annoying electronic hum,Title not worth the price of a DVD due to a distinct audio hum from start to finish. Replacement had the same problem.
2,Nail Buffer,Was rather disappointed in the quality. I bought this to use for my dogs and am a little unhappy with it. The noise really scares them too. Looks pretty generic.
4,Quality Racing seatbelt,"My girlfriend wouldn't ride in my muscle car unless she felt safe, so I picked up one of these. She feels safe now and it functions well. Plus a harness just looks cool in an old muscle car. Quality product!!"
1,Closer to Fiction than Non-Fiction,"This was the book that launched a thousand other efforts in the ""Japan Hyping"" that marked the Bubble Economy of the 1980s. The very same qualities that Vogel pointed out as key to Japan's success, and thoroughly worthy of emulation, are now attributed as being the cause of the country's post-bubble stagnation, and it is laughable to think that the Japanese edition of this book was an all-time bestseller on the country's non-fiction list. Who still advocates taking lessons from Japan on education, finance or corporate governance today?Ezra Vogel deserves a place of honor alongside Paul Ehrlich and other would-be prophets of the future whose prophecies ended up being egregiously far off the mark. His book shouldbe read, if at all, as a caution against buying into journalistic hype, a problem those susceptible to today's China-boosting would do well to take heed of; the future is rarely a straightforward extrapolation of the past."
4,Good value shoe rack,I thought this was an excellent value. My only problem is flats do not stay on the rack very well but overall I am very pleased. My closet is much neater.
5,it's a tear jerker,"i have all of mcdaniel's books (that aren't out of date) and this is one of my faves. i've read it at least three times and i'm tempted to read it again right now. it doesn't have death by a disease--which somehow makes it even better. i don't know why, but i spose it's because the dying person isn't suffering as long. the setting of the story also intrigues me. it's set on a ranch and they go riding horses across fields and trails and everything and it just sounds so romantic. i definitely recommend reading this book if you haven't already."
3,full house review,"This product was delivered in a timely fashion but had no cover box for the set. I was very disappointed about that. It will be hard to keep the set together without a box holder, I probably would not have bought it if that were disclosed. I hope the cds are o.k. themselves - it is for Christmas so we haven't played them yet. Sheri~"
5,love it!,Season 4 of Full House is one of the best!I love little Michelle...but I love the Rustman too!In season 4 a lot happens like...Becky en Jesse getting married and Michelle is growing up a lot!But she's still daddy's little angel and that's the cute part of it!I'm a BIG Olsen fan and that's way I like Michelle a lot!But D.J and Stephanie are fun and cool too!In season 4 the girls aren't little anymore they are growing up fast!I'm a Full House LOVER! It's a Full House for ever!
4,What A Blast,My girls ages 8 and 14 are enjoying this CD set so much you would think they were children of the eighties. My own enjoyment is even better than it was in the eighties. Full House Season Four is excellent programming that is noticibly absent in today's television market. If you do not like children and family situational comedy this CD set is not for you!
5,full house:the complete fourth season,"i purchased this and other seasons of this show and i thought that it was pretty good.i thought that just like the other seasons of this show i thought that this season included was a very good season of this hit series. so anyone who is a big fan of this show and dose'nt have this season of this show should buy it,it is worth the wait.i gurantee it. chrisfan."
5,best show of all times,why i call it the best show of all times is because i have watched this show since i was five and now i am 17. i love to go and say HOW RUDE! as a joke. i just love full house but if it whent off tv i would not miss it because it is om dvd. but if it whent off tv and they stoped the dvds i weould be upset. so please keep buying the full house dvds. thank you FULL HOUSE FAN FOR EVER
5,Loved it!!,"These guys can rock!! They have such a unique style of music! I thoroughly enjoyed this CD. Ron Perry is one of the most creative songwriters we've heard from in a long time! ""Walk Another Mile"" is my new, favorite, ""thump on the steering wheel"" song!! I can't wait to hear more from this talented group!!"
4,A statistical perspective of Information Theory,"The author largely explores information from the vantagepoint of its relationship with statistics. Early on, the basic properties of information are discussed. Information is then illustrated and contextualized with respect to specific probability distributions."
1,Cannot purchase item,I just spent the last 20 minutes trying to purchase this item with no success so I guess it's not for sale.
4,"Good cheese, sausage could be better","This is a good value for the price. The spreadable cheese is soft and goes well with the sesame crackers, though the beef sausage tastes somewhat like a hot dog. I would stick with a dry Italian sausage of the Boar's Head variety :)I imagined that the golf theme would be a little less cheesy, but some might find it cute."
2,Strange Workout,"Can anyone explain to me how panting with your mouth open can clear out toxins? Seriously, I was all excited about this DVD because I'm interested in cleansing my liver but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. By the third day I was wondering if I was doing more harm than good. It's the parts where you do breath of fire with a curled tongue extended that I have an issue with particularly. I'm no expert but I remember from high school Biology that it was better to breathe through your nose because your nostrils can filter out some impurities from the air. Now, if you are sucking in all this breath through your mouth, aren't you just inhaling loads of dust particles directly into your body?"
3,Not as good as Ravi & Ana other DVDs bt still a good practice,"I loved Dance with the Chakras, Yoga Bliss Hips & Fat Free Yoga, so I felt condifent that Yoga Cleanse would be a nice addition in my collection. However, the quality of the production is quite bad for this one, the image was not always clear, the music not as good than in the other dvds and the poses weren't as challenging and energizing. I would first check some of their other dvds first before opting for this one."
4,Fat Free Yoga Cleanse,"I really like this video. I almost love it, but I don't quite love it because by the end I feel a little sick and like I want to curl up in a ball and sleep. Maybe that is the whole point. I personally like the DVD's that leave me feeling energized and good. This one works my body and I feel like I've really accomplished something, but I don't feel ""healthy"" afterwards. I would still highly recommed it though."
4,So helpful,I've been searching for a replacement iron cover for my over the door iron. I couldnt find one anywhere! I finally found one that was the right size but I don't think it would stay in place without these fasteners. My mom used to have these so I was very happy when I was able to find them online.
3,These are just okay.,"The quality is so-so. The ironing board cover still did not stay taut on the board. Unfortunately, I don't thing there is anything better on the market."
5,"The ultimate chronicle of the ""trial of the century""","This is the best O.J. Simpson trial book out there. It is encyclopedic in its detail, comprehensive and exhaustive enough to satisfy any detail-lover's appetite for ""trial of the century"" tidbits.Schiller and Willworth are slightly biased in favor of the ""guilty"" side, but so am I...those who are sure O.J. is innocent may object to some of the editorializing.But there is no question that if you want the best chronicle of this extraordinary legal and cultural event, this is the place to get it. Well worth the money by page count alone! :)"
3,"Book reenacts the ""real"" saga of Simpson defense trial","I'm not a counter of facts and inconsistencies, but this book caught my eye. Just when you thought that the OJ Period had been laid to rest, another book appears! I decided to read it and see what it was about.There are several interesting points about the tyrannical Robert Shapiro, the ever cunning, out-to-get-a-dollar F. Lee Bailey, and the smooth vernacular of Johnnie Cochran. While the evidence declaring his innocence is supposed to be presented as concrete, the sly attacks thrown at the defense team for covering up key evidence and especially the ""conversion"" of the Simpson house prove to offer another side of the story.As with many books and cases, there is a slight bias in my opinion to the Simpson guilt, but Schiller and Willwerth try dilligently to present a case of equal weight. An interesting read if you have spare time, and you don't mind re-living the 6 months of ""OJ Mania""."
3,Schiller believes O.J.,"I knew the name Larry Schiller was familiar to me, but it wasn't until I read American Tragedy that I realized why: he's the guy who helped O.J. write I Want To Tell You, his book from prison. Shows you how objective Schiller is.American Tragedy is bloated and long and offers fewer ""behind the scenes"" revelations than I expected. (Is it revolutionary to find out that Cochran and Shapiro clashed frequently and jockeyed for who would sit near O.J.?)The book does clearly explain how the defense created reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds. I understand the verdict better, even if I still disagreee. The book interestingly makes a hero out of the vaguely unctuous Barry Scheck as well.I had heard that there was a really great O.J. book out, but I couldn't remember if I had been told it was the Schiller book or the Toobin one. Maybe it was the Toobin one, cause American Tragedy just ain't it..."
5,American Tragedy,"I purchased this book for my child who had a reading assignment.He doesn't like to read, but was able to read through this book pretty quickly."
1,Lawrence Schiller is simply a shill for O.J. Simpson.,"The only tragedy of ""American Tragedy"" is that Schiller probably has made millions from this trite and shallow book"
1,Dum Dum Dum...OJ is not guilty!!,When will America open their eyes. This arthur is so blinded about trial antics that he forgets the main goal of the trial. Lawyers plan their case to win win win ...They do not consider someone might really be not guilty. If you really want to know her killed Nicole.. ..read The Frame of the Century.
3,"Decent mystery, confusing at times.","This was an okay mystery. I have not read Mr. Davis before, so I don't know what he is capable of. This was not a book that could be easily read in one sitting. The set-up of the book where it goes back and forth between the jury and its characters, and the Prime Minister searching for his brother and the real killers, and the kidnappers, does not make for easy, consistent reading. The plot felt like it was broken up, even though I thought the problems with the enviro-terrorists and chemical/pesticide companies were and are very plausible. The book just lacked some cohesiveness to it. I will probably try one of Davis' books again, because he is obviously an intelligent writer. I am hoping the problems with this particular story was just a fluke. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"
3,Certainly not brilliant,"This is the third novel written by the Enlish writer duo I have read. The first two were indeed excellent, but to call this one brilliant, like mrs.Klausner in her review, is in my view highly exaggerated. The writing is good and the pace of the novel OK. Therefore I have finished reading the novel. The storyline is so far-fetched, however, and so improbable at some stages, that it took some effort to continue reading.The kidnapping of an Attorney-General is an event which leads to high attention. To survive street accidents and pursuits in the sewer is quite unbelievable. That the Prime Minister instead of talking to Judge and Jury ( particularly when the life of thousands of people is at stake) awaits the outcome and goes of on his own enquiry is complete bullocks.Also the rigging of the jury process is so complicated that it is hardly believable.The writers better stck to the micro-drama they developed in the first books; they were considerably better!"
5,Clear and Concise - a valuable resource!,"I was pleasantly surprised just how much information was actually packed into this one book. With so much printed today on the subject of subtle energy, this book takes a deeper and somewhat broader look at how the subject of energy work relates to our nature as energy beings, and our individual powers of intent and action. This is a great addition to anyone's library of metaphysical or spiritual growth resources. For me, it has put much in perspective. It describes some of the kundalini rising experiences I have had, in a way that helps put them into greater perspective. I am very glad I found this!"
1,Talking head,"This is a good book for those that have no idea what energy work or energy is. He has taken information from everywhere and put in into one book, great. He has no connection with what it is and how to use it though. Lacking alot. He is just another talking head for the masses. Nothing special here. Just what we needed another book."
1,Mismatch of metaphysical material with the author&#65533;s slant,"After reading books on Bhudism and Toltec wisdom I thought this book would provide precise methods of enhancing my body's energy systems and develop more awareness. In both cases it failed miserably.The first half of the book covered such disparate topics like the Internet and its influence in world communication, quantum mechanics and the Heisenberg principle, world politics, energy vibrations, and even geophysics. Somehow the author connected them all to some central celestial theme. I can see why many skeptics avoid metaphysics. Essentially, the first half was a culmination of many books with the author's slant.The second half spent 221 pages describing so called ""energy axioms."" [...]"
3,Good value but not good enough,"This is a neat little phone, looks good and some well thought out features but:1. The headset is wierd, I have small ears and it keeps falling off. 2. The sound quality is quite poor. 3. The buttons require too much pressure to work. 4. The Plantronics CT-10 is by far a better phone and if you have the money, buy the PlantronicsThe VTECH works better with the Plantronics headset, the OEM headset is it's biggest flaw."
2,"Great concept, not quite a reality","I want to love this phone! It's small enough, it has good range, it is truly hands free/cordless, it's even a pretty blue, but...The buttons are covered with thin plastic that is stuck on with adhesive like a bumper sticker and they are starting to peel. For some reason when I dial, a lot of static is produced as if the buttons are shorting out. I have to have the clip installed to be able to set it in the charger. If I don't set it perfectly in the charger, it won't charge, and it won't let me dial later without pressing the off button. I had to train my friends how to set this in the charger and they would still just hand me the phone. It is not loud enough. The earphone jack has just failed right where it looked like it was going to.I don't recommend this phone. I just ordered the IBM 900Mhz version (with speaker phone) to replace it. Maybe I can ""own"" the IBM, rather than just ""rent"" it, like the VTech."
4,"Scary, Fun, Well Written","I literally jumped when I watched some of the episodes....and its only a TV show. I had more fun watching this set with my mom than going to see the new XF2 movie. The episodes are very well written and classic. There will be something that you will like on here. If you haven't seen any of them, then you will definitely love the set. It is typical of what x-files is supposed to be without the filler. I would describe this DVD set as spooky and fun and well worth the money, especially if you pick it up used."
4,Worth the money,"This video is not supposed to be released until tomorrow but that does not stop the Blockbuster employee from breaking street date. I bought this DVD this weekend on the strength of 2 things: 1) Free movie ticket up to $8.50 and 2) the Comicon panel that Chris Carter, Gillian Anderson, David Duchovny and Frank Spotnitz did at the WonderCon. I own all nine seasons and the movie so the episodes were nothing new. I paid $16 dollars so minus the 8.50 for the movie ticket- I paid 8 dollars to have a concise best of collection. I thought that the episode selection was excellent up to Milagro. I did not think that it fit with the other episodes but it is all supposed to lead to the film. If you buy it make sure that you get the movie money."
4,not made in the USA,"I thought I was buying a product made in the USA but when I got the peel, it said it was not made in the USA. I was sure it was...works great."
2,Could be better,"The peel I received is lop-sided and the finish is not very functional. The shiny finish is not like a professional wooden peel surface. I think maybe a less shiny surface would be a little more forgiving - if the pizza dough is even just a little wet it sticks to this peel like glue. I got the cutter but after trying it a few times it turns out I prefer my roller cutter: this cutter sends crumbs flying.For what I payed after adding the shipping cost I could have picked up the nicer Williams and Sonoma peel that I saw after getting this one, which was the same size but symetrical and with a better surface."
5,Mountain Woods Pizza Peel and Cutter set,This pizza peel is great not only for taking a hot pizza out of the oven but also calzones.You can cut through a whole pizza with the cutter with little effort.
5,Great Pizza Set,This set is great..the wooden cutter works quite well..I use the peel to slip my bread and pizza onto a stone in the oven..it works great for cutting bread items and pizza and serving right on the table. I have a hook at the end of my cupboard and hang it right there for easy access..it also looks neat too..
3,Dont use as much as I thought I would,"I have had this a couple years and truthfully don't use it very much and seem to use my metal version more. I was most interested in the cutter piece and while it cuts fairly well, it is kind of weird to clean since it is wooden. I rarely use the peel but that's mainly because I generally cook pizzas on a stone, not straight on the oven rack. I use the peel more for cutting up bread to serve than pizza. Overall, I don't use it too often."
4,this is okay,these two pieces were bought as a set. they are of a well thought out design. works very well for my home cooked pizza
4,pizza peel,"i bought this pizza peel to replace one i had for 15 years. unfortunately, my original peel split, so i replaced it with this one. this one is much lighter, and the cutter that comes with it makes it easy to cut any pizza. it works well with any pizza up to about 15"". i am very happy with this product!"
5,Good Service,"It was a very good and your prompt service; also, as the vendor described it. I am enjoying my video!!"
5,Great music and interviews,"Aside from the fantastic music, what this video really brought home for me is how the US's totally misguided policies towards Cuba have hurt only the average Cuban and engendered widespread hatred towards the US government. (Doesn't it seem that the US's policies towards ""rogue states"" always wind up hurting only the lower classes?)These musicians put up with hardships that most Americans can't even imagine and still produced incredible music."
5,Samburu,"Beautiful and astonishing photos - gives a real insight in the life of the Samburu people. Excellent and interesting way of telling about daily life of the Samburu. Explains details and makes you part of their life, looking for more information. Go for it - you won't regret!"
5,a very good book in clearifying most .net concepts.,This is a book that I used most often even if I do hope it were written in C#.
1,Poor title,The title of the book is deceiving! There is absolutely nothing on VS.NET in this book. The materials covered in this book are also available in many other non-VS.NET .NET books. What a waste of my time and money!
3,Title is Misleading,"This book has been a good reference. The title, however, is misleading. There is almost nothing in this book that directly relates to VS.Net. It is basically a class by class reference of Visual Basic Net, with code examples etc. There is nothing about the IDE or how to use the GUI in general."
5,Awesome Book,"I have little to no prior experience to vb.net so I didn't want to get a book that didn't go in to any details or did not explain why things work the way they do because the author may assume that you know what's going on. This is by far the best .Net book I've read so far and I'm only on Chapter 4. If you want to learn VB.net, order this book!"
2,Where's the Resolution?,"This book was definitely not as good as the others in the series.The mystery seemed to be almost secondary to Desiree's relationship with Nick. Even Ellen's marriage, which has been built up for so many books, was just a passing chapter with very little detail or information. And while there was a whodunnit, that's all there was -- Desiree figured things out pretty much out of nowhere, but she never confronted the murderer and she never wrapped up the case. She didn't even confirm that this is indeed what happened and that this was actually the person who did it. I was very disappointed in the way things ended -- I actually had to look twice to make sure I hadn't missed a chapter.I hope this author isn't moving this series on to where Desiree's personal life is more prominent than her cases. There are enough of those types of series out there."
3,Not her best book,"I mark my calendar so that I never forget to buy Desiree Shapiro's latest caper. This one was a disappointment.I spotted THE clue (and, therefore, the answer and the killer) immediately. Even so, I enjoyed the travels Desiree (one of my favorite sleuths) must take to figure out what was so obvious to me.The ending was disappointing as well. Not only was there no dramatic confrontation at the end, Eichler left several smaller plot points hanging.Still, I don't regret buying and reading the book. Eichler's dialogue is always realistic with just the right amount of wit and her characters are fleshed out (especially our full-figured lead). It's just, in this book at least, Desiree's real life takes center stage while her professional life is more background material."
2,Very disappointing,"Just the facts: A) the handset has a very uncomfortable feel to it, making a long chat very irrating B) I returned my first under warranty because there would be breaks where I heard nothing, the replacement ended up doing the same thing, sounds like you are using a cell phone, the co. blamed it on interferrance but none of my other cordless models do this and they are much older C) The digital answering machine message sounds awful. The message is often garbled and unclear making it sound like a worn out tape model. D) I'm replacing it!"
3,VTech 2961 is passable,"Two problems. First off the sound quality is low even when the handset is right next to the base. People I was talking to kept asking me to speak up, and I had to say ""excuse me"" all the time to get them to repeat something I couldn't hear. But the real big problem was: whenever my printer would warm up from powersave mode, the phone would reset! I never experienced that problem with any other telephone or electrical device. So this phone was unusable to me."
2,VTech 2961 shortcomings,"I chose the VTech 2961 because I had used the VTech brand before and was pleased with its reception. This particular phone has many features and a great answering machine. Unfortunately, the signal fades during conversation frequently enough to be annoying. I do not recommend this phone."
4,We love this phone,"This is one of the best phones we've had so far. Granted, the voice quality has a little static without the antenna fully extended. But, I haven't found any other cordless phone that doesn't suffer from a problem of this kind.The battery holds the charge well, it lasts a long time away from the base, I can wander over to my neighbors and keep talking, and the physical construction quality is surprisingly good considering the price. I think the Siemens [dollar amount] phone system feels more fragile than this phone.All in all, I think this phone is a good buy; I'm thinking about buying another one."
5,Terrific Guide!!,"I agree with Frank. This book has a great layout of dungeons maps, with step by step on how to get threw it. Unfortune it, it doesn't have a map of the Hero's Cave (Secret area with a ring). The book also includes a checklist of the rings and where to find them. Also, has detailed (overworld, underworld, and past) maps over a two page spread. Includes walkthrough threw both games."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Judge Death is not the most stable or sane of individuals. His thing is that life is a crime, one naturally for which the punishment is his namesake. Dredd must stop this megavillain, of course. Plenty of other excellent satire can be found in this work, as always, including policing the enhancement regulations for the Olympics."
3,Hip Hop?,"Toni Braxton's More Than A Woman to me was a real dissapointment. Still, there was really only one good song that actually made it from that record during promotions, Hit The Freeway. The song was very upbeat and very tough. Unfortunately, there was really a lack of promotion with her album, More Than A Woman, and this was the only single. Still, it was a great song, but I think it could've been better. I prefer just the one song than the More Than A Woman album. I just hope Toni goes back to doing ballads soon."
2,average&that's a Compliment,"if Toni Braxton couldn't sing I would go One Star less but due to Her Range I give Her one extra star.it's ashame She has to come back with a Song that Lightweights like Ashanti,J-Lo,etc... would glady Sing.Toni is better than this."
4,Dig Your Own Hole / Exit Planet Dust,"Wow,I can't belive it. This was before the release of Come With Us, meaning that these two albums were the best that The Chemical Brother had produced. Having two of the best albums from The Chemical Brothers on a double C.D makes this a masterpiece.Signing Off Now,Brad Cummins"
5,Magic School Bus Books,These are a great addition to any home library. Just having them available is a great Science curriculum. The kids don't even know they are learning.
4,How to do it right book,This book is for real world NDS applications. This book wont help for taking the Novell D&I test as this book is how it should be done. Novell's test is not interested in the right way.
3,"Mostly Miami, not much Keys!","This book is probable very good with it's coverage of Miami and South Florida, but coverage of the Keys is bare minimum (47 pages (1 chapter of 13) of over 300 pages in the book)."
3,Good movie - kinda slow...,I did enjoy the movie. I did buy the movie because I saw that one of my favorite wrestlers had a part (Sheamus O'Shaunessy) and it was just a couple tiny scenes. It was a well acted and interesting story. Just a little slow. It is worth watching.
1,The Escapist,"Did not care for this movie at all. It was boring and not to my liking. I do like Joseph Fiennes, that's all I can say about it."
2,The Escapist,"Terrible terrible movie...........if this is the sort of crap Amazon is offering, they will never succeed!! I had really high hopes when I joined today, anyone know how to cancel this, plz let me know. I will give it 10 days however if no improvement happens I am out of here."
4,Beautifully realized jailbreak flick,"4.2 starsRupert Wyatt scored big on this, his first feature film. He nails it as both writer and director; the characters are interesting and believable, the movie looks grimly gorgeous, and his time-shifting script pays off in the end in unexpected ways. He pulls fine performances from the entire cast, with Brian Cox leading the way. The music is also first-rate, always in tune with the director's intentions and often quite moving in its own right. It is in fact a very smart film in most every way; even the title takes on great resonance as the tale plays out.I'm surprised there aren't more reviews of this here; it's a fine film, and maybe the best prison break movie since Shawshank. Give it time and I'm guessing The Escapist will become a true cult favorite, taking its deserved place just below such genre masterpieces as Papillon, Shawshank, and the Alcatraz films."
3,Good But Not Great,"I suspect that if you grew up eating Maine lobster rolls, this would be a taste of your childhood, but for me they were just average. A hot dog bun with some lobster salad which was an average tasting sandwich. The whoopie pies were sweet, but the frosting in between is like the old fashioned lard based white frosting."
2,This books really needs an editor...,... way too many mispellings and grammatical errors for a college-level book. I was disappointed.
5,Great DVD Set,"The X-Files will always be one of my favorite shows and it is awsome that the Mythology volumes only include the main storyline of alien conspiracy and cover up. Purchasing these volumes are much better than buying every season, because they have they best episodes that compile the main plot."
1,I hate Fox!!!!,"It's unfair that die hard X Files fans like myself can spend time and hard earned money collecting all of the X files on DVD, and then those money grubbers at Fox release these sets with new special features that they know people like me will be wanting. Why don't they just release a single dvd with all the x files features on them. I mean, the mythology is what we wanted special featues on in the first place, since that's the most interesting part. But it's not worth handing over this much money for when I've already got the episodes.It's unfair."
4,Action packed,"This set of movies is fulll of action, from the start to the finish, althrough I have all nine seasons on dvd, I like the idea of having the abduction storys all in one dvd, This story could be real."
4,Good listening,I loved this album it takes me back to the good old days when music was real music and not all of the yelling and screaming you hear today. Some of this stuff you can hardly understand.But I love this CD!!!!!!!!!!
5,This is a book I wish I would have read a long time ago,"As I read Something To Believe In, I found myself pausing between chapters to reflect on my life and where it is now. Brian's moving personal story combined with historical quotes and examples made me think in ways I had never considered and arive at conclusions I never thought possible. Any book that can cause such intense positive thought is well worth anybody's time to read. I will not attempt here to summarize exactly what is contained between the pages of this book - I can only say you will not soon forget it. Thank you, Brian Brawdy."
5,top motivation,"I've always been skeptical of so called self-help books, but when I friend tossed this book my way, I said ""what the hay"" and started reading. I was soon drawn in by this book's enthusiasm for life. You can't help reflecting on your own world when reading this. I found his views on what ""religion"" should or could be to people particularly interesting - meaning that your ""something to believe in"" is a very personal thing, and instead of telling you what to do or what to believe, Brian manages to give you a nudge in the right direction, letting you keep your choices personal, giving the reader a chance to customize the book to their own life experiences. In doing so, Brian stands apart from the sea of self-help mumbo jumbo, and helps you get down to what you can do here and now to reach your goals and be happy with your chosen path."
1,NOT RE-MASTERED,This is the second time I bought this album on cd. I've got other albums on the Voiceprint label and they're all mastered well so I bought this disc thinking that since it's on a different label and released in 2009 that it was upgraded from the one on the TRC label. Well it's not. They must have lost the master tapes of this recording because the sound quality really sucks. It sounds like the music was lifted off a poor quality cassette tape. The frequencies are so dull it sounds like I've got pillows in front of my speakers. I guess I'm gonna have to burn my old vinyl to disc because even with all the pops and crackles it sounds a whole lot better than this disc. Too bad 'cause this is a really good album by Leslie.
4,The Great Fatsby Leslie West and other cds purchased from Amazon.com,"(Amazon Verified Purchase)I have been a Leslie West fan since 1970,Mountain, West,Bruce&Laing, and his solo cds.The Great Fatsby has a good remake of Honkey Tonk Women and Mick Jagger playing guitar,also a good version of If I were a carpenter.The House of The Rising Sun is good on this album,but much better on the 2005 Got Blooze cd.I already had the Great Fatsby on Lp when I ordered it.Amazon had a three cd package of Blues To Die For,Got Blooze and Blue Me.This was a good purchase. Leslie West has always had a tinge of blues to his music.These cds are well worth it.Back to good ole rock-n-roll.His latest cd Unusual Suspects is very good. With a great guest list on it.If you are already a Leslie West fan you will not be disappointed,if not this is a good cd to get started on."
4,Great Deal for Cell accesories,"Only used the equipment for about a week. I suppose my review could change if things break soon. Initially I am very pleased.Head set works ok.Car charger works great.Leather case feels akward. But is clearly made for the A850. If you want this kind of case it's perfect. I happen to prefer one you can just clip the phone into. Not one that the case stays wrapped tightly to the phone.Is a great deal overall. If you're getting the phone, get this. ( I got 2, since Verizon has a Buy1 get 1 free deal on the phones.)"
3,Mork and Mindy,"This series is a clasic.I had a major crush on Pam Dawber at the time of this series.This series is funny but, strange.When the studio releases seasons 3 and 4 then, I will buy the complete series. To many shows are released on dvd, that never finish.Examples: Charlies angels, Alias Smith & Jones, The Partridge Family, Here come the brides. Mork and Mindy, Night Gallery. Just to name a few.If the series were released as complete series, People would buy them."
2,I Hate to Disagree,"My children and I loved the first season of M & M. The second season has us trudging through to watch them all. We wish we had gotten it on Netflix. The music store and Mindy's relatives are gone. In their place are the two deli owners from New York. Not a good replacement at all. Mindy's neighbor, Mr. Bixley (played by Tom Poston) is a new character and should be removed. He adds nothing. I have read bad reviews regarding Exidor, but my kids and I got lots of laughs out of that character last season. I would prefer him to the previously mentioned characters!Hopefully, season three will be released in spite of season two."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. It does not contain the full episodes of the series. Scenes and dialogue have been cut. It's easy to tell when someone says something that isn't funny and the audience bursts into laughter. Or, someone is talking, then the scene abruptly ends and cuts to another scene, and so on.In my 'never to be humble' opinion, this is a rip-off to the unsuspecting consumer who buys old TV shows on DVD, thinking they're getting the full episodes. In this case, ""Mork & Mindy, The Second Season,"" is not all there, folks."
2,The final touch,"For those starting out to do woodworking, this book provide some information - provided you have a lathe. However, if you are looking for examples of creative and innovative handles, hinges or knobs in the style of artisan cabinetmakers, to complete that cabinet you just completed, this is not the book for you. The authors fall short in compiling a book dedicated to one of the last item to be installed, but first to be seen in a completed cabinet. There is a world of work available that could have made this a great find."
5,Read it all tonight !,"I really got my money's worth with this book ! I homeschool my children and we were learning about POCAHONTAS. While my husband was raccoon hunting one night, I decided to read the first chapter of "" POCAHONTAS AND THE STRANGERS"" aloud to my children. WOW !!! My children begged me to ""READ ANOTHER CHAPTER"". We finished this book before Daddy got home. If you are HUNTING for a good book about POCAHONTAS, this is it ! Very SAFE FOR FAMILY book. Way to go Mr. Bulla. Thank you."
4,Emphasis on Strategy Communication and Diffusion,"Emphasizes the communications component of BSC implementation and management. In many cases, it is a rehash of the other Kaplan and Norton works. This isn't a bad thing, however. Kaplan & Norton were the inventors of the Balanced Scorecard, and their books are generally easy to read, with an almost ideal mix of case study, practical application and theoretical background.Being somewhat new to BSC, I have spent the last six months trying to absorb everything I can on the methodolgy. Alignment really focuses on how to spread the strategy throughout the organization, as well as to other external stakeholders. The Balanced Scorecard (book) is required reading before picking this one up - and this book is probably a better offering than Strategy Maps by Kaplan & Norton. A good read."
3,Okay,"This is an okay film, one of those movies that really plays out like a short-film that just happens to be full length. A two character indie play in a way. It just made me realize how lucky I am to not be trapped in a cell with a fat vile weirdo. This ought to deter kids from committing crimes, the idea of being trapped in a cell with a scum bag weirdo, who rapes and won't stop talking about his sickening weird sex memories. I'll show this to my teenagers if they are thinking about breaking the law. This is a horror film in some respects."
3,Nice collectible,Star Wars fans will certainly want to add this to their collections but it could have been so much better. It isn't poseable enough and how much trouble would it have been to add Vader's signature hissy breathing? I agree with the critic who said not to pay more than ten bucks for it. Six or seven at most.
3,Works well,Works well as long as your system works well. Pay for the surge protector for $30 it is worth not replacing the system.
3,Works Great but .....,"The collar works great. It keeps our very friendly dog in our yard, but the material of collar is terrible. It is fraying and we had to use some duct tape to keep it from fraying more. We are going to buy a regular dog collar and install the electonic device on it. We already returned a collar for this issue!!"
5,Innotek Extra Receiver For SD-2100 and SD-2200 Systems,Just bought this second receiver for our second Jack Russell Terrier. We've had the first receiver for two years now and it has worked perfectly. Once the second very active JRT had his new receiver he was trained to the boundary in know time.
4,Second collar for a second pet,This is an additional collar for a second dog for my wire in ground pet containment system. It's specific to a particular system so be certain this collar will work with the system you have. It appears identical to the one provided with the complete system. It functions and recharges the same. It can only be recharged from the base station.You may view my review of the Innotek SD-2100 system if you wish to see comments on the complete system
1,Unfortunate experience with this product.,"I saw the other positive reviews and felt confident about the purchase. I installed this in my small 7x7x7 bathroom. It never was capable of warming the bathroom up and performance deteriorated over a month of use. At this point, it hardly works at all. The Amazon seller will not accept return/replacement after 30 days and the manufacturer only has a warranty on replacement parts, so I have to now pay someone to diagnose the problem and determine what part needs replaced. Manufacturer will not reimburse me for the diagnostic."
5,Jerry's Fahrenheat/Marley PLF504 Heater Review,"I purchased this heater to provide additional heat to a small bathroom. It works great, looks good and is very quiet. It was easy to install and appears to be of good quality. It has only been in service for about a month so I can't determine how durable it will be. So far, I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product to anyone who needs one."
1,Ok but stopped working,"I bought this for my small bathroom. At first, it worked ok and heated the 10x10 space nicely. After about a month, it started becoming less effective and now it won't provide any heat at all. Either the heater itself is broken or the thermostat I had to purchase separately is broken(http://www.amazon.com/Fahrenheat-Marley-PT2DS-Thermostat/dp/B000DZDQ58). I guess I will try to replace the thermostat first and hope that is the problem. Stay tuned."
4,Interesting insight,Josh told his truth. He did not block. I felt all his pain and all his love. I grateful he survived.
3,I'm not myself,"Very well written, and kept my interest the while time. Wish it had ended differently, but then again we can't always pick our endings."
4,Liked it,Not what I was expecting at all but was quickly sucked in by the characters and storyline.Would recommend for an easy afternoon read.
4,"a well-written, fun summer read","Kilmer-Purcell is a better writer than Augsten Borroughs. ""I Am Not Myself These Days"" is well-told and endlessly facinating. The book somehow maintains a dichotomous tone that feels light and airy while telling a tale that is anything but. A very different kind of memoir."
4,Drag as a metaphor,"After I bought this book, I read the notes in the back first, and experienced a strong sinking feeling when I found that the author had a connection with James Frey (A Million Little Pieces). On further investigation, I found the author's note in the front of the book, which carries the normal disclaimers on changing names and dates and creating composite characters. The final line: ""This is the truth in drag."" James Frey could learn a thing or two from Josh.At times overblown and greasy like the underworld it describes, at times incredibly touching and sweet, I Am Not Myself These Days is much more than another story about a drunken New Yorker. I feel sorry for those who aren't touched by the ""Old Fashioned Thanksgiving,"" a real homecoming of the heart for Josh. I'm looking forward to more books by this complex and talented author."
4,What's it like being a gay Drag Queen in NYC?,"This book is both a small trip of New York and an intimate and skewed look of a man looking for himself and his place in the world. His somewhat shocking job, his transformation, his partying and his relationships. It is an interesting read, and you will often feel as if you were peeking trough a window and looking at something that you probably weren't meant to see.Overall a good read."
5,A book you remember forever,Oh My Goodness! I read this book when it first came out...read it again and again after and was just laughing and thinking about it the other day when i bought silver sparkles for my teenage daughter to wear with her halloween costume! Great book! You will not regret buying it!
5,Josh is HILARIOUS!,"Josh, I mean... Aqua, is stunningly fabulous! He, I mean... she showcases her chaotic world with such delight that you almost forget it's about drug abuse, addiction, and s&m! Kilmer-Purcell is a very underrated writer, and I could not be more in love with him, I mean... her. :) A MUST-READ!!!!!"
3,Enjoyable Drag Queen Memoir,"A cocktail of drugs and alcohol set in a relationship between an amateur drag queen and a S/M hustler would normally have me not wanting to even read the first page but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this light and amusing memoir. There is an abundance of gay writing about hedonistic lifestyles of young gay men and most of it is very predictable. Too often anything written about drag queens tends to be over camp and resembling the tranvestite world. Set in New York, this memoir stands above most of this genre for the realism and entertaining way the author writes about the excesses of alcohol and his partner's drug habit interspersed with the realities of life: visit of Josh's mother, 'bitching' with work colleague Laura and the juggling of the drag queen nightlife and a daytime job (albeit with a very tolerant employer!). Josh tells his memoir in a well paced manner without ever being too sentimental. Overall a good holiday read."
4,Liked it a lot,Not what I was expecting at all but a great read that kept me interested until the end. RIP Aqua.
3,Witty at times....,"I felt like I was on a bit of a druken, redundant spinning wheel. Although the book was entertaining and witty at times, about halfway through I was getting a little bored with it and felt like the same scenario kept playing over and over. Josh's writing style is entertaining for the most part and I would be interested in reading about his life on the Beekman Farm so it's not that I wouldn't read another one of his books, but I expected more. Overall this was his life at the time and there were some very... interesting incidents that happened, that's for sure! Easy read, but not for anyone that doesn't have an open mind about an alternative lifestyle."
5,great fish tale,"I never knew I had so much in common with a drag queen! The internal dialogue that goes on in this memoir is what I found the most appealing. He's got the courage to say what everyone has thought and the humor to get away with it. The writing is seamless: Even when the author breaks off into internal dialogue or a pensive moment, he brings you right back into the action. You're with him in a penthouse apartment one minute and in Japan in the next, never knowing how you got there, but enjoying the ride just the same. What's most incredible is the degree of normalcy that grounds Josh and Jack while the world around them is one few of us have seen."
5,A Good Read,Impressive first book from a talent we are certain to see more of. His cutting wit veils (thinly) a tender and brave heart which makes this book both wildy entertaining and relevant.
5,OUCH. GETS YOU IN THE HEART.,"Not high heels, not corsets, not orgies or overdoses could stand in the way of what this is for me--a classic love story full of rich, beautiful characters. It struck a very powerful chord that very few books can.It's unforgettable."
4,Great book! Very entertaining.,"This book definitely gives insight into a life few of us will ever lead; therefore a great escape. There are some dark topics which the author touches on but does not go into detail which keeps the book fairly light and really a story about relationships on a level that is relatable to all forms of relationships. I am being a book pimp and pushing it on all my friends and family. It is emotional and entertaining, an easy read. Loved it."
4,Great Read,This was a very compelling story that really made you think about the way that life can take you. It helps make you appreciate the things you have in yhour life as well as those that you love and love you in return.
3,WESTERN ANXIETY AND THE NUCLEAR OPTION,"This is a typical ""Western centric "" view that appears to be appealing to the inherent( racist?) anxieties of Westerners as more weapons of mass destruction proliferate in the non Western world. It is easy to point to carnage and instability in the non Western world but when you examine the record for barbarism in the twentieth century - let us not forget that the only time the 'bomb' was used was by the United States and that the Holocaust occurred in the heart of Europe, and not to forget the Gulags of the Soviet Union, another of the original developers of Nuclear weapons.So , why are we more anxious now?"
1,God Help Me.,"I have never wanted to get rid of a book like I did this one. I do not recommend this book to anyone, and I wish it was never created. I HATE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!"
1,not available,they did not have this item in stock even though their posting said they did. they cancelled my order.
1,Completely innacurate,They should be giving this away. It has never been accurate. I've tested it against other thermometers to see if it was accurate/reliable. It always registers a signficant temperature when the temp. is actually normal. Not great when you're relying on this to determine whether or not to give your child medication.
1,Accuscan thermometer,"The thermometer works fine, unfortunately you will not find replacement covers ANYWHERE! and the thermometer will not function without a cover. I purchased my thermometer from ToysRUs and they don't even carry the covers. I'd recommend buying another brand, for example I've seen the Thermoscan covers almost everywhere I've looked."
1,Very unreliable,"I got this thermometer for my 5 month old son. I am a nurse and have found this type of thermometer to be very reliable at work. When testing it on my son and comparing it to his rectal temperature (several times), I found a great inconsistancy (about 6 points, i.e. it read 92.4 when he was really 98.8). I thought that maybe his ears were two small and that it may work better on some one older. I tested it on myself, comparing it with my oral temperature and found the same problem. Bottom line is, I returned it to the store and have steered all my friends away from this product."
1,WORK MESS,"I USE THIS AT WORK WHERE I HAVE INFANTS UP TO TODDLERS, WE HAVE TO REPEAT THE PROCESS 3 TIMES BEFORE WE EVER GET AN ACCURATE READING. THE UNDER THE ARM, OLD TRADITIONAL THERMOMATERS ARE BETTER."
2,Inconsistent,"We have found that this thermometer often shows different temperatures for each ear. When we go back to the first ear, it isn't even the same as the first reading. We are looking for a different one for our second child. It's fine in a pinch, but I want something more reliable."
3,NOT THE SAME AS THE PICTURE,"The termomether they send you is not the same as the picture, so don't buy the lens covers because the thermometer they send you uses a different kind of covers."
5,some things you love and other hate,"I recived this from the hospital when i had my daughter. At first it was too big for her ears, no biggie i had a digital one for under arms.now that she is bigger)7 mos) we can use it. it is a great product!! instead of having to fight a squriming baby for 2 mins w/ a regular thermomoter in just a few seconds i get a good and accurate reading. I to have heard alot of greif about using an ear thomomoter but that also comes from a mom who thinks you dont worry about a temprature until its 106. over all its a great product for older infants. I would recomend"
2,Frustration!!!,"It's such a relief to see that others have had a difficult time finding covers too. I've searched in every store imaginable, and can't even find them online. The 10 covers lasted about a month, and I haven't been able to use it since...13 months later. I can't imagine a company would sell a product without the means to continue use of it."
1,Not happy,We were very unhappy with this product and returned it. It didn't give anywhere close to an accurate reading and we had the worst time trying to find covers for it. We ended up going with the Vicks probe thermometer. It was more accurate and took only 10 seconds to read.
2,Waste of Money!!!!,"I bought this Thermometer when my second son was born, thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money. My husband and I tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was. We both got 5 different readings. I didn't see what the need of the plastic covers were for, since we ran out of them quickly.(Not to mention, you can't find replacements anywhere.) My biggest complant was that after a month, the product completely stopped working, even after changing the batteries. I would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this item in preparation for my first child. I tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time, from 94.2 - 102.3!! I returned it the next day, don't bother!!"
1,Waste of Money,I bought this thinking that it would be easier to take my squirmy daughter's temp.Not so. It was almost always inaccurate...
4,"Works great, but not on babys!","I think this is a great product for older children like1 and older but not for newborns! I have a 2 1/2 month oldand its to hard to use with her ears, dont want to put itin to far, and she moves to much!"
3,"Accurate, but not recommended for infants","This thermometer does appear to be accurate (when tested on myself), however it is very difficult to use on an infant. My daughter is 3 months old now, and I still find it difficult (and a little scary) to use on her. She wiggles around so much that the scanner is usually out of her ear before it is done. I am also hesitant to use it in fear that she will jerk her head and end up getting poked in the ear or eye. I think it will get plenty of use - just not yet."
2,Not very accurate,"I thought the idea of an ear thermometer was a great idea. I still think it is, but I have had a terrible time getting an accurate reading from this one. Unless it is posistioned in exactly the right spot, you can get some very strange readings. I have taken my son's temperature five times in a row, and gotten five different readings. I now use my digital thermometer only."
1,mom,This thermometer was inacurate. It read a temperature at 96.5 when the braun read it at 102. I immediatley took it back. It is well worth the extra money to buy the braun.
1,not accurate,"i got this for a baby shower gift and i ended up going out and buying a cheap digital one. this thermometer does not give accurate readings. i used it on my daughter and it read 94.3, to me that is pretty bad when i used the other one got a reading of 98. i suggest buying the cheap digital ones instead. i would rate this product at 0 stars but there is no 0 rating. so i had to give it a 1"
2,"Good, but can't find replacement covers","We have not had a problem with this thermometer, except for the past year we've been unable to use it. Why? We cannot find replacement covers - anywhere! Not in stores and when we did finally order from online, the company cancelled the order due to no product. Ours only came with 10 lens covers - hardly enough to keep using after a year. Unless you know where you can get replacement covers, I suggest to NOT buy this item."
2,Disappointed,"We bought this thermometer for our first child b/c we had heard so much about the ease of these types of thermometers vs. traditional rectal thermometers. However, we found it to gave frequent inaccurate readings. Readings would change dramatically from one reading to the next (only a few minutes apart). We never trusted it as a result and always ended up taking rectal temps. Our doctor even said that the most accurate temps are rectal anyway and not to trust these ear thermometers completely. It ended up collecting dust on our changing table & we stick to traditional temps. A waste of money!"
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,THIS PRODUCT IS ONLY GOOD FOR THE TRASH....INACCURATE READINGS & HARD TO FIT COVERS. MAKES NEW PARENTS LIKE US WORRY MORE WHEN IT READS TEMP OF A NON FEVERISH BABY AT 101!DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$!
1,"not reccommended for infants, not accurate","I was ""told"" by doctor that the ear scan thermometers are not very accurate for infants, and found this to be true. You can take the temperature of the baby three times in a row, and get a different reading, each time. We use a standard digital thermomter under the armpit, or recatally, for accuracy. This item is overpriced, and when it comes to the critical neccessity of having an accurate temperature to determine illness in an infant, it is just too much to chance. I have heard these are more consistent in toddlers, so save it for when baby gets older. We are sticking with the tried and true.Don't waste your money or time, in fact, ask your doctor, they never reccommend these to babies under a year."
3,Not for Infants,Being an expecting father I try to ask my doctor about most baby care products before we purchase. This one was recommended by our doctor but NOT until after 6 months of age. The use of this item in the ear causes most infants to squeem which can make it near impossible top get an accurate reading and yet others can get an ear infection if the earscan is not cleaned properly. We have purchased this item and it seems to work very well on both my wife and I and we will review the product again when our son is aget 6 months.
5,Love this thermometer!,"I am surprised by all the negative reviews regarding this thermometer. I have been using it on my daughter for over 3 years and have never had a problem with it. When I have needed to take her in to see the doctor, the readings they get have always coincided with the results I got at home. My only problem was trying to find new disposable covers for it, but thanks to the previous review, I am on my way to CVS to find some."
2,Non consistent readings,Different readings every time we would take our babies temp. (the readings were in seconds of each other.)Probe covers too expensive and hard to find.
2,problem,my saftey first ear thermometer is stuck on celsius and will not change for me and of course with a child you tend to lose things like the manual. other wise the thermometer is ok. if you know how to change it from celsius to fahrenheit. please e-mail me
1,Do Not Buy This Thermometer,"I bought this to take my infant's temperature, since she doesn't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm. I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate, and it never gave the same reading twice. First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc. I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband. Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn't doing it correctly and he had the same results. I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Not impressed,"I have not used this product since I rec'd it because I couldn't get it to give me anywhere close to the same reading two times in a row. When I got it, I tried it on my oldest son. He didn't have a fever, I was just trying to get a baseline of how it read. It read 98.7 the first time, a minute later, it read 99.8, a minute after that, it read 97. Very inconsistant. I tried it on my second son, it was basically the same variance. I tried it on myself, same thing. When baby got here, I didn't trust it so I've not used it at all. It was a waste of 30 bucks!"
1,aggrevated mommy,"I had waited a long time to afford an ear themometer. When I finally could get one it was the Safety 1st Accu Scan. I used up the pack of covers that came with the purchase and now I can't find them anywhere. The only place is here off the internet. However, I have been with out a computer for awhile and needed to use the themometer and couldn't! I had to go buy another inexpensive themometer temporarily. I am very dissapointed in this expense."
1,Don't bother with this thermometer!!,"I bought this only a few months ago and already I have to buy another one. Why? Because you can't find replacement covers. Also, one out of 3 readings were questionable so I wasted a lot of lens covers retaking my child's temperature. I will NOT be buying another Safety 1st thermometer because they don't seem to care about their customers once they've forked over the money for the thermometer. Any decent company would provide them or buy back the ones that are still for sale all over the place!"
1,Not the best way to take the temp!,Taking your child's temp via their ear is not the most reliable way. Talk to your child's doctor about it.
2,Hold On!,"I have not had a problem with errors or the temperature reading of the thermometer. However, what good is a product if you can't use it? I do not recommend buying this product as you will not be able to find the replacement covers. I have searched everywhere only to buy another thermometer. And, when I brought this product in 00' it was 49.99 now it is twenty dollars cheaper but still a headache as you can't find the replacements."
4,easy to use,"i was given this thermometer for a shower gift and boy does it come in handy. The only problem i have had with it so far is finding replacement lens covers. For all those who dont know how to change it from C to F it is really easy. make sure the unit is off press the ""m"" it will show wether it is in ""f"" or ""c"" then turn the unit on and press ""m"" to change. And for all those buying unit it is extremely important to save all the manuals."
1,No good!,Not worth the money! I have never been able to get an accurate reading. It's too big for a child (toddler) ear.
2,covers and accuracy,"I can't find covers, but will try the cvs brand. I noticed some inconsistancey with measurements, but I did not read the instructions that advises 2 minutes in between mesurements. One should make sure that they read the instructions carefully and not throw away the manual. It looks self explanatory, but it isn't."
1,Not accurate,We registered for this thermometer for our first child. We have to go buy a new one now because this one never gives the same reading. You can take your childs temp within a few seconds from one another and the readings change drastically. I highly suggest that you look for another thermometer than buying this one. It is a waste of money.
1,Not a good product,"We just purchased this toy yesterday and we are so disappointed. The structure is very flimsey and fell apart numerous times already. The package came with very small amounts of paint and tools. The worst part is that the canvas does not come clean! We tried a high pressure nozzle, soap, scrubing and even bleach and still you can see chalk and paint lines. This toy is way over priced and not worth the money. Save yourself $50 and buy paint and regular paper!"
3,off the black,movie came on time and was in great condition. not nick noltes best work but an okay story. movie was a little slow and drawn out.
3,not a stretch for nolte,I started watching this move on the cable and i could not change it. I found it to be an exceptional drama with Nolte giving a remarkably beliveable performance. If your a Nolte fan see it. It also has a better than average supporting cast with some little known actors.
2,Arrived damaged,"This item arrived damaged. There was a split in the wood in the corner of the pool table. It was not packaged well. There was NO real protection around the table and the box was not very sturdy. I'm still dealing with the company that mailed it to me. My son who had waited quite a while for it to shipped was disappointed. I believed that I was buying a new product, but this did not look like an unused package and the shipping was EXPENSIVE!"
1,Boring,"I read history books to learn all about world history and I expect this to be an enjoyable experience. I bought this book because the other reviewer gave it 5 stars. I guess I am looking for a Reader's Digest version of this series of wars that explains everything in layman's terms (and it wouldn't hurt if there was a little excitement or inspiration in it). I am next going to read the Seward book on this subject (because it is inexpensive and it has 5 stars ratings) and then I will compare the 2 books. No one should buy this book if it is only your first or second book on the 100 Years War and you are not a history student and dont know that much about French and English history. This book was just very boring. After I read the Seward book, I will re-read this book and see if I can give it more stars or not."
4,Sting of Death - 60s B-movie can be great fun!,"Sting of Death and the scenes from ""Love Goddesses of Blood Island"" are great campy examples of Drive-In B-movies in the 60s! Great fun for the whole family as something radically different and nostalgic. ""Death Curse of Tartu"" is not as good as ""Sting of Death""."
2,"Stupid, monster b-movies.","If you are ten years old, you might like these films. If you want a serious horror film buy ""carnival of souls""."
2,Sting of Death/Death Curse of Tartu,"I bought this DVD because my mother-in-law is one of the dancers in Sting of Death. She is billed as Linda Lee Craves, however, her name was actually Linda Lee Cravey. She is the dancer in the green and black bathing suit. The movie is hilariously bad. We watched it because my mother in law is in it and that is about it. This is one of those that should be watched on Mystery Theater or some show that pokes fun of really bad B horror movies. Some of the reviews on here are a little rough the movie has its moments. If you are a fan of B horror movies this one will make you laugh. Happy viewing."
1,Poorly photographed and noncomprehensive.,"Was very disappointed in this book. A lot of the photographs were out of focus or poorly composed. Several shots of trees with buildings hiding behind them. Also, book doesn't include houses even though its supposed to be about Cincy architecture in general. Not written from an architect's perspective."
5,My Cats Love It,"All three of my cats like the taste of this toothpaste. It's easy to get them used to having their teeth brushed if you use one of the mini-toothbrushes, just take it very slowly and let them get used to having it touch their front teeth at first, then slowly start bringing the brush to their molars and pulling back gently on their mouth to expose the teeth a little. My cats figured out pretty quickly that I wanted them to open their mouth more and usually follow along because they like the taste.I have tried the seafood flavor as well, but my cats definitely prefer poultry flavor."
5,A decent Paul Bearer,I saw this and had to pick it up to go along with my Undertaker as he is dead on. He has the look he had when first coming and his last look (not the Kane look). He comes with the urn which is about the right size when compared to the figures. The only thing I noticed and didn't really notice it till I bought the new Undertaker/Paul Bearer (thier first appearance in WWF) was that Paul is almost as tall as the Undertaker which he shouldn't be. You don't notice until you have them side by side (really noticable in that package). other than that he looks perfect. there is both a long tie and a bow tie version. I've seen both and both look great. a definate must to get for any Undertaker fans.
1,Save your money,"This DVD is old dino material you probably saw in school in the 60s and 70s, Shell Oil Company made the films for schools, and they will put you to sleep just like they did in school. Unless you get them for nostalgic reasons SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,Turrill Teaches in Belding,"If you want engaging and deep, tackle the classics first instead of fattening the wallets of local AP Lit teachers."
2,laptop battery,battery is not even 2 months old and won't hold a charge need to get a hold of seller to do something about it
2,Where did I hear that before?,"As with the 2 previous reviews, I agree that alot of the book was repetitive. The book also lacked flow. There were spots that he should have given more details but didn't. There were some interesting notes as to why players were not taken to task. However, I found myself looking for more....but it just wasn't there."
3,Strange bedfellows,"I bought this CD because I can't get enough of An Evening with The Chieftains. I have no issue with copyright protection and I don't advocate illegal file-sharing, but the protection on this CD went too far. It was gathering dust on my shelf until I found out how to make an exact audio copy of it. Now I'm reacquainting myself with this CD. If you're a Chieftains fan, it's worth the effort."
2,Good CD - Horrible Copy Protection,"I bought this CD while I was at a Chieftans concert last night. I listened to it in my car first, so I didn't notice a problem. I really enjoyed the CD and wanted to listen to it with headphones at my desk with my computer. I stuck the CD in my computer and it starts trying to download and install the copy protection software. Well of course all of the security software on my computer went crazy thinking I had some sort of virus. I had to completely turn off all of my security on my computer to even get the CD to play on my computer. Then after copying the files to my computer to listen in windows media player, I unistalled the software it downloaded. This made my media player crash when I tried to play the files. Great CD, but the copy protection needs to be executed in a better fasion. I'm not really happy with having to turn off all of my security on my computer just to listen to a CD - especially when I'm on a high speed LAN connection."
3,Flames Across the Border,Got tired of reading about one battle after another but it is well written. Learned alot about the War of 1812 that sure wasn't taught in the American History 101 I took in high school or college.
2,"i hate to say this, because I had high hopes ... but","this book is really not good. David Ritz's Gaye bio isn't perfect, but it's way better. The quotes Davis uses from interviews are just plain lame: mostly they are broad and impersonal. This book works better as a history of Motown, but not even so well as that."
3,Too much about his music and not enough about him,"This book became boring at times, it was full of things about his music, and not much about the man himself, I really didn't like this book too much, it bacame somewhat of a chore to read at times."
5,Best volume yet,"This series has really picked up with the last two books. Ananda is the best so far, with a lot of references to the actual history of the Buddha (though some big liberties taken with Ananda's real story). This is a softer book, without a lot of the violence from the first few books. It also continues the trends towards depth that book five started so well.I thought about quiting this series after the first couple of books, now I'm glad I haven't. I just hope the quailty continues through the final two books."
5,My daughter loves being the mommy!,We purchased these for our 2 1/2 year old. She loves the diapers & being able to change her baby as we really change her little sister. She just loves being the mommy. It is so cute to watch her play with these.
4,Excellent performance,"I love the viola da gamba on this dvd. The performance is very good. This is a live performance and one thing i did not like is the quality of sound, it isn't bad but you can tell they could have done a much better job, for example, there is some strong parts of the music that get compressed and the softer parts get lost right after, the mics are simple not the best, but the performers talent makes you forget and forgive this detail. overall is a must have dvd, I watched more than once and i always enjoyed."
5,I have completely fallen in love with kundalini!,These are not like other yoga tapes. There is no logical sequence of static poses like other methods in which I have trained. Here the workout almost feels like playtime with its ballistic vigorous energetic movements. There are times when you can recognize something close to a regular asana but nothings ever static. I love it! I realized that my other practice had been making me more tense. These workouts are a breath of fresh air. Ravi Singh is a very good teacher. Very intelligent with an inspiring flow of talk. Ana Brett is an excellent model and moves like a dancer. It is a joy to have them in my living room! The emphasis is on the breathing. There is a warm-up and stretching on both tapes I have (yoga Cleanse and Total Tune Up). And meditation too. I also like how you can break things up though so far I haven't had to. I recommend these.
5,I love ny new liver!,"My sister gave this to me when I told her I was trying to quit smoking. It was my third time trying to quit and I have to say that this really helped get me through those first rough weeks.After all the breathing I just didn't feel like lighting up - I was already lit up! It really helped calm me down and give me energy at the same time.The first week I did this I felt nauseous and that is a sure sign that the liver is getting rid of toxins. It took awhile but I am definitely feeling better and I am still not smoking.Ravi Singh always seems to say just the right thing at the right time. Ana Brett is a joy to watch not only in for her amazing yoga poses but she looks so healthy and energetic and that has been an inspiration to me.If you are trying to quit smoking or trying to quit anything, or just want to up your level of health radically I would recommend you try this."
4,Pretty good; One flaw,"Great product ... extremely sturdy and was very well packed. It comfortably fits my DVR, Xbox 360, PS2 with room for a stack of game cases on the glass shelves. My 37"" tv fits very nicely on top.Now the problem:The glass is a rectangle, it does not conform to the shape of the bottom and top pieces. Take a close look at the diagram and you'll see what I mean. If I had done that, I might have looked at another piece. For the price, the piece is good and now that I've built it -- it's worth keeping."
2,Yoda head not durable.,"I loved Yoda. I recently purchased this little guy and his foot immediately fell off. My three year old said, ""Dad, I can do it""....and he put it back on. This shows how easily the foot pops on and off. As we walked through a dept. store he then mentioned how the head was gone. It had come off as well. The feet and head are on attached via ball and socket. I found the toy dept. and bought a different Yoda. This one is nice for a collection but not durable for play."
2,Very durable this Yoda action figure is not.,"Much like others here I was excited for my 5 year old to get his first Yoda figure. Though the sculpt and detail look pretty good, the quality is very lacking. My son has lost both the left foot and head at various times. It seems as though the socket for the ball on the left foot is not deep enough. This causes 2 problems: 1) The left leg ends up being longer than the right and 2) As mentioned earlier, the foot just pops off. I got it for $5 at target so it's perfect for your collection (I have all of the figures so far) but not for playing."
1,Worse than 1978,"The entire line of Revenge of the Sith Hasbro figures (I mistakenly purchased 10) is the worse set of figures since 1978. In fact, the figures in 1978 were more durable and more realistic. It is VERY clear that Hasbro sacrificed quality for cost...didn't work."
3,Gimmick doesn't work,Yoda comes with a base and when you wind him up and stick him on it he supposed to spin. He does not.
2,Not a game for math haters,"I don't like math much, & this game is a math game. Not advertised as such, but that's what it is."
4,Sexy and suspenseful,"Much like her Midnight books, the story moved quick, packed with action and gun-toting hotties. Tension, sex, and a compelling story. 'Nough said."
5,Excellent Read!,"Lisa Marie Rice is a fantastic author. I could not stop reading Woman on the Run - reading til after 2am when I had a big meeting the next morning! And it was worth it -- I've also found the rest of LM Rice's work, and am eagerly waiting for the next book!"
1,Torches Extinguished The title says everything to the reader,"Elizabeth must be a very angry women. This is the sad impression I got on reading this book. I hope she experiences Peace before she dies. To the reader I would recommend ""Why Forgive"" by Johann Christoph Arnold"
5,AWESOME!!,"This is the coolest of all of the ROTS Clone Troopers!! He has good articulation. His little blasters I couldn't fit in his hand very well, but his DC-15 Rifle fitted better. It's cool when you have the original Red Clone Commander and then the Green Variant of the Clone Commander!!"
5,BEST ACTION FIGURE EVER!,"The clone commander is a great toy very durable. He is hard to find so if you see him grab him. He comes in green and red. Personally, I like the red better. I've been looking for almost a year and I saw a green one and at that point I didn't care. Right now savons is the best place to look call them every wednesday. He comes with great accessories 2 pistols a rifle and a grappling hook with hooks on both ends which he could slide accross im almost 13 and my cousin is 20 and still plays with them."
1,"""Mom always told me that monsters don't exist... But they do, don't they?""",Glam rock died for a reason. All these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced.- Thus says the Pellington
5,Awesome!!! It Rocks!!,"I saw this cd advertised on tv. I was surprised by the songs it had; my favorites-songs that I wanted to have! I bought this precious cd a few months ago and I still enjoy it. Even though I was born in '86, I'm a big fanatic of 80s rock and this collection is part of what makes Rock N Roll the best. I'm glad this cd is in the 100 top sellers."
2,If you can keep your eyes open this is something unique.,"There are so many factors that this film has that make it a tue b-movie and cult film alike. There is one major drawback; it is sooooo boring. I mean, its got all the bad acting, the wierd plot, and wacky occurances that make b-movies great for those of us who love them; yet it fails to deliver something that you will want to watch again after you see it. That is, if you can even get through it the first time."
1,Ewe'd better watch out. This movie is baaaaad!,"I love cult films and Something Weird usually delivers the goods, but this movie is boring. Aside from the hook of a giant mutant sheep, the film is tedious and depressing. The extras are pretty lame too. One of the shorts features a woman being explicitly raped by a sasquatch, which the cover fails to mention so keep impressionable eyes far away. Avoid this DVD like the plague!"
5,A Primer for New Project Managers,"21st Century Jet is an exciting look at the complexities of modern product development. It is highly illustrative of the very latest concepts of systems engineering, integrated product and process teaming, logistical considerations, and customer satisfaction. The documentary is applicable to virtually any category of complex systems -- from freeway overpasses, to automotive advances, to children's toys. A must-view for today's managers of engineering design efforts."
2,Defective,"While the system was easy to set up, unfortunately, the DVD player did not function perfectly. On several DVD's I tried, problems like the inability to select certain chapters of a movie, or the picture freezing up, occurred. (I tried the DVD's in another player and could not replicate the problem.) I sent it back and did not bother asking for a replacement product. Also, the buttons for DVD functions on the remote are really tiny and the user manual did not explain things as well as it should have."
4,Guitarists are strumthing special,"The fellow on this instruction video (Jon Chappell) lends the beginner guitar player his good attitude toward the lessons ahead. Just like the book by the same name, the sprinkle of good humor is also felt in the video. This helps the student to relax and get ready to practice, practice, practice... at your own pace."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This DVD is a waste of money. It does contain some useful information for a beginner but the cold hard truth is the amount of information provided is not worth anything more than the plastic its made of. So unless you pick this up from a friend for free, I highly advise you not waste your time and money ordering this product. This DVD says it will teach you how to read music. Lmao scrolling music notes across the bottom as the instructor plays is not ""teaching"".***If you're a beginner and want to learn the guitar you can find all kinds of great information on youtube for free. My favorite instructor is Paul Gilbert."
4,like the title says,this product is very recomendable for people who dont have enough time or money for private lessons. very easy to understand and to follow. could be a little longer.only the singing is annoying
1,Smarten Up Dummies - This CD doesn't cut it !!!,"I was very disappointed in this CD program. I have used some of the ""Dummies"" books in the past with great success, and I thought this would measure up the same way.How wrong I was. I need the most basic of basics to play my guitar. I am mechanically proficient in many areas, but not with a 6-string. The video is too fast paced for me. Some may find it useful, but, for me, it was a bomb."
3,"Good, but inconsistent chord fingerings","After watching a borrowed copy of this video, I decided to buy it. Overall, I think this is a good video for beginning guitarists. I like John Chappell's teaching method. However, upon careful scrutiny I noticed that when he plays some of the songs (such as ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore"" and ""Sloop John B."") he uses different fingerings for some chords (like G and Dm) than the fingerings he told the viewer to use. The alternate fingerings (using the pinkie finger, which is difficult for beginners) allow the instructor to make quick chord changes during the song. But a viewer using the recommended fingerings will be struggling to keep up and may become frustrated.In addition to this video, I recommend the eMedia Guitar Method software. It is a very complete teaching system, well paced for the novice guitarist."
3,partial receipt,"Received used as requested. Video is good, however.....video refers to booklet for additional information. Booklet not included. Also, tape cover flap broken off, could be (probably)snail mail handling."
4,Great,I have not finished using this product but so far so good. I am a beginner and the pace of the video is good for me. I would recommend this product for beginners who want to move at a slow speed.
4,Gave it as a gift.,My husband loved this book. Now all he needs to do it find a manager and off he'll go into the world of music. Really though...it is a great start. He learned so much from it. and it was easy to follow for him. Thank you
3,Blurred but ok,"The dvd was full of risks and it was blurred. Also the cover was broken, but that could have happened during the transport."
3,Inconsistent,"I received two of these at my shower. One works great, I can clip my baby's nails in about a minute while he's sleeping. The other one is horrible, not sharp at all! I have to clip and clip at the same nail."
1,Dangerous!!,"These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago. I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type. Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger. His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked. Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage. But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company. They are VERY safe. I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents. I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails."
2,Too awkward,"I purchased these, thinking they looked comfortable to use. They're not. They are a pair of normal, plain baby nail cutting clippers with a plastic bulbous structure attached to it. They are awkward to use, as there is no grip. I think if the handle was made of a rubber like material or had finger contours, then perhaps this would be a much better product. For the price, I can't complain, but I personally didn't find them any easier to use than your ordinary run-of-the-mill clippers. They do cut the nails well though."
1,not sharp enough,"this thing doesn't work well at all - you'd think it's a simple product, but for a fidgety baby with small fingers, you really want something precise and sharp, to cut the nail on the first snip. this clipper doesn't accomplish the job. we ended up using one that a friend passed along, and really noticed the difference (though I don't have the brand name for you). i've also heard great things about the file--less risky."
1,THE WORST!!,"Amazon won't allow NO STARS...I am a mother of 4 and recently purchased these clippers after ours were left at grandmas. Worst purchase EVER!! They are longer than average clippers, but only the bottom handle, top handle is SHORTER!! Not only were they hard to handle, but they hurt ME to use! Shorter top handle has sharp edges which dug into my thumb. Can't believe how ornery I could get over a pair of clippers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!I would recommend...The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier. Magnifier isn't necessary but clippers are quality."
3,Seem Safe,"I have used these clippers just once, they did a good job. I dont love them( not really comfortable to use) but they get the job done."
2,Didn't Work Well for Infant,"I bought this clipper based on the reviews here at Amazon, but was disappointed. I tried using it on my 1-month daughter and it did not perform well. Granted, clipping baby's fingernails at that age is a bit hard anyway, but the clipper lever was very stiff and hard to manage with little fingers. I use it now on my daughter who is now 4 months and it is now only ""OK."""
4,Haven't used but doctor recommended an emery board,"I am sure we will use these in the future, but I wanted to post saying that our doctor recommended an emery board to avoid the risk of cutting the skin of a newborn because their nails are so close to it. Just wanted to let new moms know what I have learned."
2,A Disappointing Read,"Thomas Cleary is an outstanding translator of non-Western books for English-speaking peoples. I have thoroughly enjoyed many of his books. Nevertheless, this work appears to be less worthy.Basing his work on the Qur'an and Sunnah, Cleary merely quotes appropriate verses, but without comment, without depth.The Life of Muhammad is one of the most researched. His character is impeccable, his behaviors pure and remarkable. Yet, the reader misses all of this in Cleary's book.Far better is Karen Armstrong's ""Muhammad A Biography of the Prophet"". It is ideal for non-Muslims. Martin Lings has written ""Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources"". This is ideal for Islamic believers."
1,The Wisdom of the Prophet: The Sayings of Muhammad,"Do not buy this book if you want to know everything that is in the Muslim Holy Book, the Hadith, because it is only a partial version. In small print, on the front cover, the author states ""selections from the Hadith"", and that is what it is, just certain selections. When I want to learn what is in a certain philosophy or religion I want to read the entire text not just selections from it."
4,very nice choice for perfume,"Insurrection By Reyane For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 OuncesDecided to do this review on this scent, i think its a must-have for every woman, from a personal stance the scent is a clean, sexy alluring one so if u dont want comments or to turn heads u should not be wearing, its long lasting (I CAN TELL)a bottle feel and broke in my L/room and everytime some1 new enters they comment on how good the house smells. So in my case i guess its giving Glade serious competition, lol, anyways stop the reading and just click CHECKOUT u wont regret I can assure that!"
4,review,"I was satisfied with the product, the only problem I have is that FEDX only deiver monday through friday. I was supposed to receive it friday, they never came, and I had to wait until monday. I hope amazon will stop using them and use USPS instead. Good perfume though."
2,Pretty Pictures,"For those interested in a comprehensive video providing techniques and tips, this is not the collection for you. However, those interested in some of the finest file footage of offshore fishing, this video collection provides you enough to satisfy your needs. Like all specialty items in a narrow market, the price for this collection is expensive; especially if your unfamiliar with the author or the host. I would suggest if you are looking for tips and techniques, go to Saltwater Magazine and order George Poveromo's collection of videos. If you're looking for just a good collection of footage, take a chance that this video meets your criteria, if it does, you can always buy the rest of the collection."
4,Very Happy,"Everything went well with this purchase. I had hoped there might be a newer Blu-Ray version available...but that is not Amazons fault. I ordered easily, it arrived on time and in perfect condition.Thank,Bobbie"
3,Why bother when you only need Lonesome Dove?,"I own and have watched all 3 miniseries (along with the non-canon Return to Lonesome Dove), and quite frankly, the only one worth rewatching is the original, Lonesome Dove. So skip out on Streets of Laredo (quite dull) and Dead Man's Walk (quite headscratching).The original 4-part Lonesome Dove is the best out of the bunch, so save your money and buy it on its own instead of in this boxset. Unless of course, you wanna pay $35 for Lonesome Dove plus four coasters..."
5,what the 2010 collection contains,From RHI Entertainment:THE MUST HAVE EIGHT DISC LIMITED EDITION SET OF THE WORLD'S FAVORITE WESTERN SAGAincludes * LONESOME DOVE (remastered and restored version) * RETURN TO LONESOME DOVE * LARRY McMURTY'S STREETS OF LAREDO * LARRY McMURTRY'S DEAD MAN'S WALK * A collectable 12 page photo booklet * Exclusive complete deck of Lonesome Dove playing cards
4,The Lonesome Dove Collection,"No clean clothing, nice hair. Lonesome Dove Collection is about as close to the wild west as it gets. Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry it self is a classic, with stars like Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones and much more, plus for the price you get two more story films, You just can't beat it. But I would recomend watching them in order. #1 Dead Mans Walk/ #2 Lonesome Dove/ #3 Streets Of Laredo. Other grate actors like David Arquette, F. Murray Abraham, Keith Carradine, Edward James Olmos, Danny Glover, Diane Lane, Rick Schroder, Anjelica Huston, James Garner, Sissy Spacek, Sam Shapard and George Carlen."
5,Lonesome Dove Awesome Movie,"I am so glad that I purchased this movie. It is one of the best I have seen, and would advise anyone who enjoys a good western that this is the series to have. A must for your collection.Deirdre and Barry Hancox"
1,Hearing Impaired,Those of us who are hearing impaired cannot watch this .. no subtitles or captioning. Please -- whoever produced this should get with the program. This is so unfortunate.
4,Two of the discs skip and won't play on any machine. Can we get them replaced?,"I am not sure what to do about this...but two of the discs won't play without skipping and freezing so many times that the story line is interrupted. Can we return them for a new set? We LOVE Lonesome Dove, but need a set that works please. Thank you. As an addendum...I received an email extremely quickly telling me that the product would be replaced with expedited shipping and how to return the defective product. We are so excited to receive the replacement! Thank you for such fast response time!"
5,Best western ever!,"They don't make them like this anymore...movies or men. Gus and Call are my favorites, although other characters are great, too. I enjoyed the entire collection, but Lonesome Dove is the best. I only wish Tommy Lee Jones had still been Call in Return to Lonesome Dove. And while I like James Garner, he was a little too talkative in The Streets of Laredo."
1,No Subtitles,"I was astonished to find that there were no subtitles on Lonesome Dove disks. So if you are slightly hearing impared, you are out of luck. I have not purchased a DVD from Amazon that did not have subtitles. And nowhere in the product description is it disclosed that there are no subtitles. But alas, apparently I have not read the one-star review that mentioned this. Maybe, if enough of us complain, Amazon might be move careful to give a more accurate description of the product. You should not have to read 89 reviews to find out this information."
2,Quality control a problem,"This is the first tie I have ever had a problem with Amazon and their products. The problem here is the set of 8 DVD's on Lonesone Dove series. In every set I have seen there have been multiple scratches on the disks. The real problem is disk # 1, second part, entitled, ""Return to Lonesome Dove"". This is the third set I now have. This set shouuld be in everyones home- really that good. I would really like Amazon to just send me the one disk to complete the set,but after all this time they may say for me to send it back and they will return my money. I really love the set. The problem is not Amazon, but rather the supplier and their lack of quality control.The single and also double DVD""S have been clean without scratches. Maybe someone has a line on where to order this set of Lonesome Dove without the scratches."
5,damaged disc's,The series is great but we have two damaged disc's that don't play and we don't know who to contact.
3,dead man's walk / lonesome dove/ return to LD,Mr. Mc Murtry sure can write the ultimate western!! I enjoyed Dead Man's Walk. Casting this flick was top notch. It was interesting to see how it all started. Keith Carradine was superb.Eric Schweig totally rocks as Buffalo Hump. I think the native actors need to get more recognition for their roles. Return to LDwas just OK. Some of the actors didn't return to do this flick. That was disappointing. I thought Angelica Houston was excellent and what can you say about Mr. Duvall. Just an awesome actor!
1,Never received the product,"One star was the lowest allowed, but for some reason I never got the product and I've been too ill to figure out what to do so I just ordered from someone else."
4,Lonsome Dove,"I loved the Book, so I wanted to see the T.V. series that I heard was very good, the first 2 cd's were great but thats all there was...return to lonsome Dove was not the same actors (have not watched it yet,) sort of left me searching for the ending.....are they even available or is that all there is of the series???"
4,Become a part of the western feeling,"If you can live with the out-dated visual effects, this is a mini-series really worth the time. A splendid charactirization of the west in all its colors, from comedy to tragedy. The movie is in constant motion with only few slow passages."
4,Lonesome Dove Collection,Great set I wish they had given more information on the contents of the collection.Well worth the price. The cronolgy of the set needs to be explained a little more.
1,Big Disappointment,Six of the disks were of good quality. Two however were impossible to view. The second set I ordered was impossible to view on the same dics. Where is quality control? Second set returned for refund.
1,Spam Mail Marketers,"I've gotten 5 pieces of junk mail this week alone, referring me to the website for this book. Just for that alone, I'll go to my grave before I send these lowlifes one red cent of my money. Spam-holes."
4,Psychedlica Instra-Mental,"Wow - bought this blind as Im a fan of 1960's hammond grooves and what a find. About 50% of the LP is amazing, especially with the Lava Lamps going. A few tunes have been sampled by the usual hip hop plagarists but hey - at least they give these cats a new lease of life. Dark melancholy grooves are interspersed by light dancable numbers. Don't take my word for it people - any discerning Mod\Garage Punker should buy any and all copies of this NOW."
1,"Purchased in October,expired in December","I'm not sure what the life span is of a drip pan, but these only lasted my about 2.5 months as a long estimate. What is worse is I don't cook that often. My main complaint is that they are rusting."
2,"Returned them, coils don't lay flat","The problem with these drip pans is that they need notches for the 3 edges of the coils to lay flat within the pan. Without 3 notches the coils stick up and if you aren't using a heavy pan, the pan doesn't lay flat. Therefore, i returned these pans. Walmart has a set w/ 3 notches that i purchased instead."
2,Don't Fit,"When I saw these I thought it was a terrific deal. I had been looking for replacements for an older Hotpoint stove. I had read other reviews saying there were no problems with them fitting this brand, so I ordered them. Unfortunately, when I was putting them on the stove, only the two small ones fit. The two larger ones were 1/2 inch too large. I will keep them for future use or sell them in a garage sale, because the cost of sending them back isn't worth it."
2,"Ok, but don't fit","I have GE model# J-BS27B-C1WH and although the size 6 and 8 inches should fit, these don't. Can't seem to find a full set anywhere of the correct drip pans. Wish these had worked."
2,didnt fit,"These were almost great. The size was perfect and I love that the drip pan and outer ring were connected, unlike other models. On these though, there is a small clip that makes the pan sit unevenly and not safely on the stove. We threw them out."
2,worth only 50%,"It should be able to replace GE WB31T10010 6"" and WB31T10011 8"".6"" did, 8"" didn't.So it's worth only 50% of it."
5,Perfect fit for my Frigidaire stove,"After reading many reviews, I decided to give these universal pans a try. I figured if they didn't fit well... it wouldn't be a terribly costly mistake. I measured the holes in the top of the Frigidaire stove... they were 5 3/4"" and 7 3/4"". Not quite the 6"" and 8"" that this package is sized for. Whew! They DO fit! In fact they fit perfectly, which is better than the slightly ill-fitted universals my landlord provided to us when we moved in."
2,wrong drip pans,ad said fits jenn-air but didn't fit my jenn-air. although my money was cheerfully refunded the cost of return shipping was more than the purchase price of drip pans.
2,They did not fit.,"These pans did not fit my stove burners.In other brands I've used, the drip pan had three slits along the rim, so that the arms that support the electric coil sit levelly and securely on the stove top. In the picture, you can see that there is one slit immediately opposite the (not quite large enough) electric access hole. There are no others. Without them, there was no way to seat the burners, they just wobbled on top, at an angle.I will say that I had no trouble returning the items, though. UPS came to my door to pick them up and my account was refunded the entire amount quite promptly."
3,Not for GE Ranges!,"I ordered these based on a review by ""Hank"" which said they fit his GE range, which has a similar model number to mine. But they DON'T fit. Trust the product description that says they don't fit GEs."
4,Nice,This item was as described. The smaller one didn't fit my stove because of an air tube that comes up from the oven. Other than that they were great.
5,Perfect fit for my KitchenAid Drop-In Rangetop Stove,Perfect. The ones I have bought in the stores over the years have not been as heavy duty quality and as perfect of a fit for my white KitchenAid Drop-In Rangetop Stove. I just put these on tonight and I am very pleased with them so far. Decent price too. Hope they clean up well and stay as shiny and high quality as they look now.
3,"Small pans fit, large ones don't","I have a very generic GE apartment stove and the large drip pans were an inch too small for my large burners even though they should have fit based on the measurements. The small drip pans fit though so I'm keeping the set, just because the price was low enough."
4,"Good price, get two sets",These fit my stove just fine. They do stain easily. Rather than obsess over them I ordered an extra set for when I want my stove to look impeccable. At this price it's a no brainer.
2,"Only the 6"" fit!","I required GE replacement drip pans with product codes WB31T10011 (8 inch) and WB31T10010 (6"").Only the 6"" fit properly. Although the price is right (likely for even just the 2 that fit), it's a disappointment to not have the whole set work as-is."
2,Doesn't State Not For GE,The product itself is fine -- very nice looking and thick. My main problem here is that no where in the description online does it state that these are not applicable to work with GE cooktops. Needless to say I was immediately disspointed when opening the package. That's rather important to know...
3,Doesn't fit GE stove tops,"Despite the fact that this is listed as ""universal"", it doesn't fit GE stove tops. It may work great on other brands, though..."
5,Finally drip pans that actually fit,"After purchasing drip pans for my 1968 Kenmore store at several locations including the big box stores and none would fit flush with the stove top (they were too deep and would sit up 1/2 off eye opening. I decided to try Amazon. My pans arrived today and actually fit. With a new kitchen remodel but keeping my old faithful 42 wide range, these new drip pans really make the stove look new."
3,nursery care kit,everything works great except the thermometer it takes a long time we just bought a different one but everything else is wonderful!
5,"GREAT PERFORMANCES, INCREDIBLE AUDIO","As the Director of this project, it was our goal to make it as great as possible. When Ringo and I discussed doing a state of the art 5.1 true surround sound soundtrack, based on complete new remixes of all the songs, he agreed immediately! Joel Jaffe of Studio D in Sausalito did great work on the new 5.1 mixes! If you have a surround 5.1 system, you will get more than you monies worth! So, now you can watch these great live tracks, and experience them in true audiophile splendor! We are very proud of this release! Four great versions of Ringo's bands. This is very cool indeed!"
3,It surely don't come easy!,"A futile attempt to shore up a lost cause. Ringo's better at playing drums. All the other guys did better even at singing ""his"" originals. Nostalgia, the only reason for buying this DVD.....and ""A whiter Shade of Pale"" by Gary Brooker!"
3,"good workmanship, but wrong color and missing screws","This is a well made, attractive and functional unit. However, it is not walnut, more like light cherry. Also the screws needed to attach the legs were not included. Although I am disappointed with the color, it is too big to send back. Now I just have to go to the hardware store for the screws."
3,An OK Buy,"I purchased this cabinet several weeks ago and received the wrong item after about two weeks. The correct cabinet came about two weeks later for a total of 4 weeks wait. I was disappointed after Target was not able to expedite shipping for the correct item to be delivered after the first mistake. Overall it is a pretty good looking piece. There are some scuff marks on the sides and drawers so you may want to stay away from the darker cabinet. It is a little pricey but overall, it is an OK product. Assembly is incredibly easy."
5,I'd give it 10,"Just pop the Cd in and get ready for an intense, cocky assault on your ears...I'd recommend turning it up as loud as possible. The vocals and solid drumming make every song worth listening to.The aggression and feeling put into this cd definately passes easily to the listener. It's comparable to the bands Snot and At the Drive In, just twice as intense."
5,"Not Punk, but CERTAINLY not Nu-metal, either","Reading through some of the other reviews of this CD shows exactly why this CD probably didn't sell very well. Too punk for the metal crowd, too metal for the punks - What this is in an extremely intense & angry heavy rock CD, worth buying for the vocal performance alone. Listen to ""Justified"" and hear Casey become absolutely UNHINGED. Unfairly lumped in with Nu-metal (this has NOTHING to do with Limp Bizkit), the best description is new (not nu) metal with punk / rock n' roll attitude. Highly recommended."
4,I love this band!,"The only reason they do not get a five star rating is because I feel their best work is ahead of them. They are an original sounding band, they are both punk and metal without being too much of either. This is much better than their first album which was a great piece of work as well. In response to other reviews which attack their song writing on this album they are right to a minimal degree, the writing is a par lower than their previous effort but the album as a whole is more complete and more pissed off than their first. Which leads me to my next point, buy this album used or new it doesn't matter it's a worthy investment. They are an original and should be heard."
3,"Okay, but not as great as their first CD.","Let me start by saying that i ADORE Amen's first CD. However, while this new one may have more intensity, it lacks the solid songwriting of the first. ""Justified"" is an amazing track with an incredible climax, but most of the songs lack the tight riffs and grooves of their first record. If you don't own any Amen records, get their debut album first."
3,Whale Butchering...Awesome,"Doug Fine's later book, ""Farewell, My Subaru"" is a much more refined and edited text. He is not a Mountain Man. Obviously assembled from numerous essays on heating a drafty cabin, pursuing game with a Remington 870 shotgun, and characterization of the 'locals' operating on ""Homer Time"" it's a bit choppy. I have to admit, though, that the section on traveling to Barrow and freezing through the harvesting of a whale with the native population was worth picking up the book (half price). Read it after ""Farewell, My Subaru""."
3,perfect mask for my costume,"I bought this to complete my catwoman costume for halloween. it was easy to get on and doubly easy to get off seeing as it kept trying to slip off all night. I needed to use a pair of goggles to hold it on my head and keep the eyeholes in place and I still had to pull it down every two minutes.so if you do decide to get this, it looks great, but you'll probably need some duct tape on the underside or something to keep it on your head for more than five minutes."
1,Ridiculously slow!,Ordered a catwoman mask for Halloween. It arrived after Thanksgiving. Really!? Why would I need it now? Company never emailed to say it would be delayed or anything. Unbelievably poor service. Will not order from them again.
3,It looks more like a batwoman than a catwoman,"The ears always tend to fold that way (as the picture shows), die to the simple pattern. Cat's ears faced forward, not sideways. Makes it look very funny, spoils the moment. Also, the eyes cutouts are just cut out, not treated. Well it's very simple one use kind of thing."
3,Looks great!,"Looks great, feels awful, but what can you expect from a vinyl cat suit? Expect to sweat, but also to make everyone sweat around you! Make sure to buy a whip to complete this hot, hot, hot look!"
4,Perfect for my costume,"The Cat Woman mask was the perfect completion of my costume for a recent Halloween party. It was a bit sweaty when I was inside, and my hair looked atrocious when I removed it. However, when I was in the cooler air outside, it was perfect. The size was just right for me, but I have fine hair, and my head is not very big. I'm not sure it would fit someone with big hair."
4,Fun buy,little snug and slides up but its super cute :) it has the sexy shine I wanted and Im happy that the ears aren't as big as shown in their picture worth the buy <3
3,ok mask. didnt want to stay put!,"Bought this for a Halloween costume.-The cap fits snugly over my ears, however I noticed if something were to touch my head it sounded reeeally loud. When I tried it on I was constantly having to pull it down in front, to make it stay put. Overall, my bf said it looked juvenile & cheap.This mask is an alright purchase, I wasn't too pleased, but was able to make use of it~ I got creative by cutting the ears out, stuffing them so they appeared stiff & attached them to a headband I had.Made for some cute cat ears!"
4,Super Sexy! LOVE IT! Makes the outfit!,I was worried this mask would look cheap but I was wrong. It's stunning! It does slide up a bit but it did not bother me too much. A way to fix it is to use a double-sided tape on the bridge of the nose area.
4,Good Writing,"Good writing, but I wish the author would go back to the ""Archer Series"" or something akin to it."
4,"A good thriller, if not the most realistic Wiccan story","I found this book to be a great improvement on the first book.Nam deals with a very real problem in a realistic manner, although some of the book's events, like those of the first book, seem a little farfetched. Nevertheless, if you are simply looking for entertainment, it is written in a fastpaced and very readable style. Sidney is a welcome addition to the cast. The ending is wrapped up in a far more satisfactory manner than the first book.Isobel Bird's CIRCLE OF THREE is a more accurate portrayal of life as a Wiccan teenager. WITCHES CHILLERS focus on being murder-mysteries as much as being Wiccan books for teens. They're pretty good as thrillers go, but like thrillers, require more suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader to overlook some things that tend not to happen to the average person. This is a thriller first, rather than a depiction of life as a typical Wiccan teen. That being said, it's a gripping and entertaining story."
5,Witches' Night Of Fear,"This is a great book. I love the that Silver Ravenwolf wirtes her ficton books. This story deals with the magick from the religion of wicca, not the fairytale stuff you know about. Bethany Salem, a 16 year old girl, along with her friends Tillie and Nam search for new members for their coven WNO(Witches' Night Out). During the book some strange things are happening with Nam. She get a new boyfriend and sunndenly she forgets to do things for the coven that she's supposed to. Also she stops showing up at meetings. Well bethany and tillie with the help of new friends try to figure out what's wrong. What they find out is very disturbing. All tuns out well in the end and the action and the mystery never stop. Another thing I like about this book and her other books in the series is that in the back she's listed hotline numbers for abues and other things. I really enjoyed this book and I hope she writes more for this series."
3,Not as good as the first,I like this series but this book felt pretty lacking.There were some continuity problems. Bethany mentions that her dad was dating a psychologist a month ago but as I recall he was engaged to a lawyer. The book was also pretty violent. Now I know thath it's murder mystery but it got to the point where I couldn't buy that people were willing to accept that much violence and not need therapy. The end is filled with bloodshed and the teens manage to take it all in stride. I thought that the first book handled their reaction sto violence much more realistically.
1,Unrealistic and out of date,"I bought Witches' Night of Fear because after having read her first book. I do like Silver and her books for Wicca have been great. But this foray into non fiction is seriously lacking. For starters this is supposed to be for the teen set but Silver seems so out of touch with her readers for that to happen. Her characters, story line and use of phrases dates her back to a teen novel of maybe the 70's or 80's. ""Mean machine""?? Nam for the name of a character sounds like it's an old Nancy Drew novel from the 50's. She has a great nack for her helpfull wiccan books but not as a novelist."
5,Seger is a American Rock Icon!,"My first taste of Seger was way back with Stranger in Town and I have been a fan ever since.After a long wait , all I can say is the wait is over and I'm glad the Detroit man is back in the swing.With his husky voice , the album rocks out with the first track ,offers up a classic Seger ballad with Wait for Me and surprises with the fun cover , Real Mean Bottle with Kid rock.One of the best tunes is also a duet with Patty Loveless in The Answer is in the Question , where thier voices work excellent together.Truly a great come back and lets hope we won't have to wait for 11 tears again!!"
5,Fantastic!,"I've been waiting a long time for Bob to release another cd, the wait was worth it! Great tunes, every song is good. If your a Seger fan, you've gotta get this!Great job Bob, your getting better with age!"
2,Disappointing,"I am a big Bob Seger fan. I have many of his older albums (yes, vinyl) and CD's and enjoy them frequently. So I wanted to enjoy this one also. Unfortunately this outing is definitely not up to par with most of his other material. The songs are, on the whole, lackluster and forgettable. The melodies are uninteresting and repetitive and the lyrics predictable. As other reviewers have pointed out, Bob's voice sounds tired and strained throughout. There are only one or two songs that rise (slightly) above the level of mediocrity that the rest of the CD is mired in. Sadly, it seems that Bob's best songwriting years are far behind him. I expected better from this rock and roll legend."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"When you have this long a wait between albums you expect years of artistic pile-up to be whittled down to a fantastic come back CD. Instead, Bob took bits a pieces of old stuff, rehashed it into a new song titles and subtracted some of that old time rock and roll. It just leaves nothing to soothe the soul. YAWN."
4,It's Good to have him back,"It is great to have Bob Seger back. Yes, this album is what you expect from Bob, but that's what his fans love.The only thing I noticed while listening was that he sounded a bit restrained on his vocals, not as down and dirty as he usually got. If you know his music, you will know what I mean. I am unsure if this is attributable to the throat cancer he had.All in all a good but not GREAT effort."
3,"OK return, but far from classic bob","The record is only average, the songwriting is nothing special and towards the middle of the disc things really start to bog down. There are few nice mid tempo rockers but nothing outstanding and not even a real pretty ballad just kind of mudane rehash of the kind of stuff that was on his last two forgetable releases. The thing that really made his classic records good was the piano playing and sax which is all but missing on this record. The heavier sounding bass and guitars sound dated and the female singers on just about every track sound tired and out of it. I will give bob kudos for the effort and guts to put out another record at the age of 61 but this is far from his classic work, at home i give all my dics in j river media center 1-10 stars and this one gets a 7, nuff said."
3,so so for an oldie,"a little too laid back for Bod and the band. Not bad, but not real thrilling either. Come on Bob, go back to the great stuff"
3,not the real Bob,I was expecting hard driving rock-n-roll and what a got was a bit washed out and soft coming from Bob Segar and the silver bullet....so if you want a bit of more introspective playing and technical feat then you will enjoy but if your looking to get back to the Hollywood nights or see a dancer in a club downtown go dig out the old stuff cause this one (like uncle joe)is afraid to cut the cake.
5,True Bob Seger,"A true Seger fan will love ""Face the Promise"". It is pure Seger! All the songs are written by Seger and reflect on this stage in his life. His voice is as strong as ever. Seger still rocks!"
5,FACE THE PROMISE BOB SEGER,I HAVE BEEN A SEGER FAN WITH HIS SILVER BULLET BAND FOR A LONG TIMEAND HAVE ENJOYED HOW HE TELLS A STORY WITH MOST OF HIS SONGS.FACE THE PROMISE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HIS WORK.sURE GLAD HE DECIDED TO PUTTHIS ONE TOGETHER AS IT IS TYPICAL BOB SEGERAS ALLWAYS AMAZON'S SERVICE IS EXCEPTIONAL
1,Not Seger of old just old Seger,"I love Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band seeing them multiple times years ago, and I still listen to his albums frequently. I finally got around to listening to this one and I have to say I could not find one good song on the cd. Really disappointing."
3,BOB CAN STILL ROCK!!!!!,Bob Seger face the the promise is a good cd. he older now and still know how to rock. WRECK THIS HEART. AND NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. is the song`s I Like the best. good cd for bob seger fan`s. real mean bottle hay that song whith kid rock is good thy can do it!!. THE ANSWER IN THE QUESTION To me it was ok. but all in all this cd is good. old bob is still the same. thank you.
5,"IF YOU LOVE BOB SEGER, YOU WILL LOVE THIS",TRUE BOB SEGER FANS WILL LOVE THIS CD DVD COMBO. I HAVE WATCHED THE DVD 20 TIMES. THE CD STAYS IN MY CAR.
4,Bob Still Rocks,"I will buy any and all Bob Seger Albums because I am still an Old Time Rock and Roller! This is not my favorite album he has done...It is indeed good enough to buy and own, but I much preferred ""It's a Mystery"", just my personal preference. Hope he tours out here to California soon!"
5,The older you get...,This is the best album ever put out by Bob Seger. I cannot wait for the concert!
5,Bob Seger's Face The Promise,"Saw Seger in concert in January 2007 at the Palace in Auburn Hills! He was amazing! His new cd is definitely reflective of his brilliant abilities as a performer - age has not slowed him down one bit! If anything, he looks like he's having more fun on stage now than he did in his 20's and 30's. I highly recommend ""Face the Promise"" to any Bob Seger fan, you will not be disappointed."
1,You probably will never play it more than once or twice.,"As a BIG Bob Seger fan I hate to say it but this album is not good, not good at all. You would think by this time he would have composed some songs worthy of rememberence but there is not one here. Yes, all the songs have his signature sound/beat/hook but it is too repetitive and the subject matter is similar from song to song. Self examination and reflection and longing and the eagerness to move ahead and the decay of society expressed in a song is not always enjoyable to a listener (in my opinion). I bought this CD right when the store opened on the day it came out; ad you probably will buy it too if your a fan like me. But if I were new to Seger I Would try: Against The Wind, Stranger in Town, Night Moves, and Nine Tonight (live) first. Personally, even as a fan, I would have skipped this one."
2,so sorry...but don't buy this cd,"I have been a Seger fans since way back when and I was really looking forward to this CD. I got it the weekend it went on sale. I'm sorry now to say that I wished I had heard a few songs off the CD before buying it. It is dull, the subject matter is somewhat depressing and it has not even a single song on the CD that seems to stand out and make it play worthy. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had someother people listen to it with me. They had the same reaction. I have sadly put this one in my CD case and probably will not be pulling it out again soon. As much as I like Bob Seger, my advice is to pass this one by."
3,Great songs but his voice is completely gone.,"Unless there's something terribly wrong with my copy of the CD, Bob can barely stay in tune. Off-pitch and flat just about everywhere. I don't know why he didn't use software such as Pro-Tools to correct his voice for the record. So many other people DO! I guess I'll have to wait til warm weather comes back to roll the car windows down while listening, I'm sure I'll enjoy it better. You've been warned!"
5,Eager for Seger!,"Bob Seger has outdone himself again. This is not just a Seger album, it is a Seger course on life. Its not ""forty years ago when I was young"" its forty years later and Seger is a sage and continues to be an awesome songwriter. I don't know what it takes to wear out a CD but I'm trying--you should love this!"
4,Excellent Effort,"Yeah, I agree with some of the reviews, Bob has mellowed and the songs might not have as much firepower as his early music. After my first listen I was not impressed. The good thing is, who reviews a cd after only one time through? C'mon, you need to listen to this at least five times before making any judgements. I have had this on over and over and Bob gets a high-five from me. The more I listen, the better this gets. We all want to recapture the moments from the 70's and early 80's, but that's not going to happen. I am proud of the music on this cd, Bob has done a wonderful job. He's not 30 anymore, give the guy a break. I think Seger is still one of the greatest ROCK N'ROLLERS and I appreciate the effort on Face The Promise."
3,"It's still Seger, and he's still good.","I'm a huge Seger fan, and was thrilled to hear he had a new CD. I was a little disappointed. A bunch of his old songs are still played regularly all over the radio, but I don't see any on this CD jumping out and having a life like that. It's still Seger, and it's still good, just not great, like a lot of his old stuff."
4,A Surprising Solid CD,"After listening to the CD, it is very apparent Bob Segar has lost quite a bit of vocal range compared to years past. But, if you purchase the album knowing that ahead of time, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised to find the songs are solid both in lyrics and melody."
4,Best studio album since Against the Wind,"Having tried and failed repeatedly to like ""It's A Mystery,"" ""The Fire Inside,"" and more than one or two tracks on ""Like A Rock,"" I was not expecting a whole lot from the new album, since it had been years since a Seger album lived up to the potential of the man who brought us ""Night Moves,"" ""Stranger in Town"" and ""Against the Wind.""Imagine my suprise in finding it to be better than ""The Distance"" and almost as good as ""Against the Wind."" Unbelievable.If you're a Seger fan who wants to hear the background singers like we did on ""Fire Lake,"" get this album. It does not disappoint"
4,BOB SEGER FACE THE PROMISE,BOB SEGERS LATEST IS BACK TO HIS ROCKING BEST THE ROCKERS ARE BACK TO HIS HOLLYWOOD NIGHT DAYS.WHILE THE BALLADS ARE THE STRONGEST BUNCH OF SONGS RECORDED IN YEARS BY SEGER
4,Face The Promise is worth the wait,"Yes Bob is back with a vengence.In this album produced by him offers a mix of heart pumping rock with a few slower ones.Wreck this heart,wait for me,face the promise are very good tracks.Real mean bottle with Kid Rock is good even though I'm not a fan of his.It makes me wonder though where are the rest of the Silver Bullet Band? Not like I miss them or anything but its kinda like Sears and Roebuck.Anyway my favorite female singer is helping belting out the tunes.Shaun Murphy from Little Feat.Although this album cruises along it runs out of gas with The Answer in the Question and Between.The Long Goodbye is ok wrapping up this 12 track album.This album could of been called The Stranger returns back in Town.Its a welcome relief! Its a Mystery failed miserably.Welcome Back Bob!"
1,"Sorry to say it, but it's not very good!","I've loved Seger from way back.Saw him in concert in the late 70's. Magnificent talent!After reading the reviews here, went out and bought the new album and listened to it on the drive to the beach.Sad to say it ""never got out of 1st gear"". Songs ALL had a very homogeneous sound to my ear. Very plodding....almost put me to sleep at the wheel.REALLY don't want to say that. I was hoping for much better.Spend your $$$ on the early work if you don't already have it.I just spent $250 on tickets to see him in concert. Hope he can still crank it up with his classics."
2,Bob Seger Face the Promise,I was very disappointed in the new songs compared to his past. Only two did I enjoy.
2,Didn't think this CD lives up to the promise,"As a Bob Seger purist, I just don't think this CD is that great. Good, but not great. That said, I'd probably listen to ""any"" song this guy sings."
4,"Welcome Home, Beautiful Loser","It's great to have Bob back. I have all of his albums dating all the way back to Live Bullet (1975) and it's amazing to me how good his voice still sounds, because his singing style is hard on the voice, not dissimilar to Tom Petty's style. The great thing about this CD is that while he has unquestionably embraced Nashville sensibilities, he still rocks quite solidly. Country is nothing new to Mr. Seger - He had top 10 hits with the primarily country songs ""Fire Lake"" and ""Shame On The Moon"" in the early 1980's. It's just that at this stage in his career, country radio will certainly take him in much more willingly. Top to bottom, the songs are solid and the execution even better. Welcome home my friend...it's been far too long."
4,Useful desk reference for hydrocarbon physical properties,"Excellent basic textbook on the properties of hydrocarbons. Contents include Physical Constants, Characteristics of Petroleum Fractions, Molecular Weight, Fugacity, Critical Properties, Thermal Properties, Density, Viscosity, Combustion, Flow of Fluids, Flow of Heat, Equilibrium Flash Vaporization, and Fractioning Towers. Definitions and discussion are included on most properties and some processes, including a discussion on the function of fractionating towers."
1,You have got to be kidding me...,"""Sexy psychics must stop a terrorist cell from destroying humanity.""No! I don't know what hurts my head worse, the concept behind this book, or that you people are actually buying it. Stop perpetuating this crap by giving them money!"
2,"Movies are good, but a 3 DVD set?","The 2 movies are adaptations of Doctor Who TV episodes from the 1960s - each squashing about 3 hours of TV into 90 minutes of movie. For all that, the movies do a pretty good job. A Lot of slow padded scenes are trimmed of deleted.However, this release is inferior to the Region 4 (Australian release), which not only puts both movies on 1 dual layer DVD, but also incorporates the documentary on these movies, ""Dalekmania"" on the same disc, along with photo galleries & movie posters.Frankly, if you can play region 4 discs, I'd get the Australian version."
1,Rotten Installation and Customer Support - have yet to see if program works (XP user),"After hours upon hours of hair-tearing, teeth-gritting frustration with downloading and re-downloading, uninstalling and reinstalling, WORTHLESS online Norton-provided help tips, failed registrations and 30-minute customer service wait times, transfers and disconnects, only to speak with people who have thick, hard-to-understand accents, I've finally installed and activated NORTON System Works Basic 2007 and Internet Security 2007. Time will tell if these programs actually work and don't end up screwing up all my other programs. I STILL need technical support help with installing Partition Magic - the stupid zip file that they give you to download contains a bunch of files, NONE of which will open for a reason I'll have to wait through another hair-raising 30 minutes of canned music, ""thanks for your patience"" b.s., transfers and disconnects to find out."
1,Avoid this product,"I have used Norton products for more than 20 years. I have never been so frustrated with software!First, I purchased the Norton Internet Security / Norton Systemworks download. Systemworks would not work properly. I went through all the suggested steps advised by Symantec. No improvement.I returned the downloaded software and purchased the DVD bundle of the same products. Installation went smoothly, but Systemworks would not work. Again, ran Symantec's removal tool (as recommended by Support) and reinstall everything.Systemworks Basic 10.0 still refuses to work. I trashed it and replaced it with my old Systemworks 2005 - which works fine."
1,Will not work with VISTA OS,Won't even install if you are using MS Vista. A quick check on the Norton web site confirms this.
4,Nice mug!,"If you like chickens, you'll like this mug! It's even better than the picture. (hen on one side, rooster on the other)"
1,Horribly UNorganized: A difficult read.,"While everything in this book is more or less technically true, and it does contain a few advanced technique tips, it's just not worth it.The book has small print, that is hard to read. Topics are covered briefly, in no detail or real discussion. Topics are sometimes repeated. Diagrams and photos can be nice, but clutter up the space on the pages, making for a layout that is chaotic and difficult to follow. The book manages to miss some of the most important topics for newbies; namely topics like pooping in the woods, and similar considerations for women. The offerings here are no more than what one can find on any number of sites on the internet for free. Generally though, it's useless fluff, even for a beginner. I would recommend Day Hiker's Handbook STRONGLY over this useless waste of trees."
2,"Been there, done that...","If www.Amazon.com allowed half-stars, I'd probably give it an extra half. Right down the middle. Not stellar, not a total dog.The biggest problem this book has is character development. There's only one, Hlynur Bjorn. Everyone else is a prop, and Hlynur isn't much of an improvement. Lazy, cynical, unfeeling, uncaring. You read through page after page hoping he'll have a catharsis and turn into a human being, but it never really happens.As www.Amazon.com's editorial reader mentioned, you get the feeling something is lost in translation. There seem to be some puns and word plays which are probably terribly funny in Icelandic, but fall down flat in English.In all, I just failed to be compelled. There is a window opened to the quirks and culture in Iceland, and some stabs at what makes Icelanders unique as a people. The problem is, the arch attitude displayed by the characters was a turn-off. I can go to any bar and get that with much less effort."
1,MISLEADING,"I bought this tape thinking it was a new Ravi Singh tape...but to my surprise it was an old tape I already ordered 4 yrs.ago with a new wrapping and a woman on the front cover that has nothing to do with the one that does the yoga in the tape. This ought to be forbidden since you can't return the videos once you open them. I felt they stole my money.What kind of ""morality"" does ravi singh have to do something like this?? I'll NEVER buy any of his tapes again."
2,Fireworks 4 FX Design,"This book is a good ""starter"" book.. The one thing that really annoyed me was the abundance of errors in this book. This is my first FX book, bought it with so much anticipation :-(. The bottom line is, if you bought this book and you find yourself asking ""what am I doing wrong?"", here is a news flash for you - ""IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!"". Save yourself the money and buy the quickstart series (a 5 star rating) or the Fireworks 4 Bible (fantastic reference!)."
2,More mistakes than you can count!,"OK... it's kind of a fun book-- nice & colorful. And they have a bonus disk of Comstock photos to play with (lo res)-- but there's practically a mistake on every page! Sometimes more. Files on the example CD are named differently from the book, the author seems to lose track of her line of thought mid-paragraph... the list is endless. I cannot recommend this book."
4,Essential reading for the non designer/artist!,"I found ""Fireworks 4 f/x and Design"" very helpful in teaching the creative possibilities of using different tools and techniques together. I'm not much of an artist when it comes to drawing but Joyce's book also helped me to get some creative juices flowing. It helped me think differently (and yes, I use a Mac!). I can now approach a project and think more in terms of assembling an image or project as opposed to drawing it."
3,"Good Quality, but...","The quality is great, they are an interesting piece of jewelry. They come wonderfully packaged along with a post card from the jewlers designers. The problem is the width of the earring wire! It is too fat for my ears! I could hardly put them on, and when I did, it irritated my ears so much I couldn't wear them. It is a shame because they are lovely."
1,old perfume,This product would've been fine if it wasn't old and stale. To add insult to injury Amazon says i can't return it because it is flammable.
1,You get what you pay for.,"I thought I was receiving a good deal for my favorite perfume. The cost was 7.00 dollars, I thought WOW! what a great deal. I was so disappointed I can not ware the perfume it smells awefull."
5,"Very Cool, very nice","I have worn Very Cool for men for several years. This Christmas, I purchased it for my wife. WOW!!! It smells terrific. We both like this fragrance and highly recommend it."
5,I miss the Nike watches,I love these watches these watches awesome. It's too bad that Nike discontinued these I'm not sure why. I'm pretty sure these were selling like hotcakes. I guarantee if place these watches back on the market. They will sell out in a Matter of days. Great Watch recommended to anyone Very sporty.
3,Flying Death,"Yes, this product does work. Nats sometimes fly right through because of there size, and flies are hard to catch because of how bulky the swatter is. When you actually make contact it kills them dead, and if they are big enough they start to burn as well."
1,don't work,would never buy there stuff. it don't work and they sent me two of theim and none work thats sad.
4,Rosehip Jelly,"Great tasting jelly for someone who wants something different for their toast, waffles or muffins. Worth the price."
3,"Rent, Don't Buy","The best fight on this disc is the one between Matt Hughes and BJ Penn. It is a very exciting, and surprising, fight. The main event between Couture and Vilifort is a dud because Couture's eye gets cut about 30 seconds into the fight. The doctor stops it. If possible, rent this one and save your money for ""Undisputed""."
3,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Expecting the best from this DVD I watched from beginning to end anticipating that the best was saved for last, wrong! If you do rent this event skip to the end watch the Cotour vs. Belfort fight, get it out of the way and enjoy the other fights on the card. I agree, rent DO NOT buy!"
4,A Very Well Done Rune Deck,"This is one of the Best Rune Decks out there only out done by the Power of the Runes deck. It is based upon the Anglo-Saxon Futhork which has long been ignored by most runemasters. The art work is done in a pen and ink style that is based more on the Christian influence upon the old Anglo-Saxon beliefs. For instance the Thorn card has demons and devils prancing on a card that is associated, even by the Anglo-Saxons, with a thunder god. Unfortunately, it includes a blank rune, the invention of Ralph Blum and never existed before him. Still all in all well worth having."
3,Awful Amazon Kindle Quality - Great Book,"This is a great title to read if you are interested in Gay Telese. However, be wary of the kindle edition that Amazon is selling here. It is so loaded with typos that the end of chapter 7 can be unreadable. I found myself having to infer the words the author had originally written. The fact that Amazon is charging $10 for this quality is a total rip off. Do yourself a favor and buy a used paper copy of the book for far cheaper so you can read it as the author intended. Support any used/local book seller over Amazon."
3,works....but very loud!,"I bought this to use in my Dell 1600 at work. It does fit and work, but it makes a loud clicking noise when printing. Otherwise its ok."
3,True Hollywood story--in epic detail!,"I saw this documentary at the 20th anniversary screening of ""The Stunt Man"" at LA's Egyptian Theatre last year. It is a low-budget DV affair consisting of the director, Richard Rush, describing the endless process of getting the film made and released and the various individuals who tried to prevent him along the way. It is shot as an homage to the visually inventive style of ""The Stunt Man"", full of camera tricks and transitions. Being a huge fan of the film, I was fascinated; those who are less interested in this sort of story may find it overlong and overblown.To me, ""The Stunt Man"" is one of the best (if not the best) films made about the film industry; I've seen it many many times and am delighted that a DVD is finally being released. This documentary is a fine companion piece and true to the hall of mirrors theme, it's a film about making a film about making a film...""If God could do the tricks we do, he'd be a happy man"""
2,"Loved the the film The Stunt Man. Was surprised by the amateurish, hokey quality of Rush's documentary about making it.",There is some interesting information on the writing and making of The Stunt Man but it is buried in aludicrously hokey framework.g. mitchell
1,Interminable,"What could have been a fascinating documentary about the making of a brilliant film is sabotaged by amateurish camera work, not-so-special ""effects"" and a script delivered by a director who comes off (though not necessarily is) fascinated more with himself than the film. It is cheesy and unending and makes any information about the film secondary to the ""artistic"" effect they were going for. If you took out all the needless narration, there is probably about ten minutes of interesting info about the film, but you have to wade through so much muck to get to it, it becomes frustrating. The Stunt Man was a brilliant, layered film. This documentary (or is it a mocumentary) is trying so hard to be as edgy and multidimensional as the film that it ultimately comes off as bloated, amateurish and uninteresting. In short, this film is nothing like The Stunt Man and any good will carried over by that brilliant picture is burned away by an overabundance of pretentiousness."
2,So what>,"The Stuntman is a masterpiece, a great vehicle for a great actor. The Making of ... came with the film as a bonus. If you are really interested in the machinations behind the scenes in Hollywood (I am not), then this may be of some interest to you. I will not bother watching it again and would rather have just the movie a couple of dollars cheaper."
1,I hate this thing,My toast is either burnt or untoasted - there is no middle ground.The door doesn't close tightly.The dials don't properly point to the task you select.The top coils burn your baking items before the lower ones heat up - broiling is really all you can do.It takes up a lot of counter space for an appliance that I curse whenever I use it.
1,uneven toasting,As one review put it - this oven toasts remarkably unevenly. One part of the toast or waffle gets burnt while the other half is just right.
2,"How about a newer, updated edition?","my library ordered this book for me and i was excited to learn something new. unfortunately, this edition is from the 90's and mr. garrett hasn't bothered to update or add any new information. what is troubling about an old book (esp. for new, beginning gardeners) is that he recommends adding peat moss to his soil mix. there is enough data out there about peat moss to know that it is a no-no in organic gardening. when i went to his facebook page to ask if he planned on updating, revising the book so we could have a new edition, he did not bother to answer. very sad indeed because as someone that has made a great impact on organic gardening, he doesn't seem interested in advancing the cause."
1,Extension Agent information only,"This book is nothing more than a compilation of information that can be had for free from the county extension agents. I found nothing new in it. Your time would be better spent talking to the county agent and getting specific information for you county, as it would be easier to find that way, than in this book."
4,"At last, Gardening Answers","This book has been really helpful as it details a multitude of crops indicating both botanical and common names, when to plant, sun or shade, uses, common pests and how to handle them organically. The book includes soil ammendments including what not to use. It helps you identify what is wrong with your crop and what to do about it. My garden has been far more successful using this information."
1,Very biased..,"I cannot vouch for the content of the rest of the book, but the content on homosexuality is very appalling. The author attempts to make a netural stance, but as you read into the chapter his bias slowly creeps out.Rather than citing resources that *help* gay teens and parents, he gives names of places where you can *change* your sexuality. I cannot believe that a doctor would be advocating changing sexuality, since that kind of treatment is impossible and may do more harm than good."
4,Classic Childrens storyasd,This is a cute Russian childrens classic. A must for any childs international library of DVDs. The DVD itself has been excelantly converted to dvd format far passing many other conversions that I have seen.
1,If I could make this 0 stars I would ......,"Ok this movie I know is based on a fairytale, but PLEASE!!! This is horrible. Let's see we have a talking bear & the mouth hardly moves. A blind lady who knows where's she's going. The rest of it was all a blur. A really ugly wicked sister & yes this girl is UGLY ! I don't recomend watching this unless you see it on MST3K. If you see it there it's hillarious. This is almost as funny as Hurculese Unchained!"
1,very trippy,"oh my lord, I just saw this movie on Mst3k, there is no explination of it. One question why did the bear cubs take the mushrooms? Hidden message I think so!"
2,Whew!,"Frankly, this movie is the pits. There's a reason it was included in the Mystery Science Theater lineup, and unsurprisingly it's because what you've got here is a bizarrely staged fairy tale that fails on oh-so-many levels. The costumes and sets are hokey, the dubbing is atrocious, the effects are ridiculous, and even as budgetary constraints prevented the film from looking as magical as a fairy tale should, the filmmakers apparently decided that they could make up for it with the sort of slapstick that will appeal only to slow children under the age of ten. Entertaining only as schlock."
1,huge disappointment!,"I purchased this tent for Memorial Day Weekend. I was almost certain it would rain and I thought I had nothing to worry about with a brand new tent and its ""guarantee"" to keep you dry. Of course we had a tarp, we were sure to set up the tent exactly as instructed. The tent totally leaked all around the bottom red panel and created a nice little pool of water on the floor. Luckily, we had an inflatable mattress that kept us dry overnight. I'm returning it tomorrow."
1,A slight wind will knock it down...,Took it camping for a week in Big Bend. Had to stay in a hotel because 20-30 mile hour wind gusts collapse it...Thought I would save a few bucks by getting it. Wish we had packed a sturdier tent. We were the only ones around us who had to pack it in for the night.
2,leaks like a sieve,"Nice tent for fair weather only. In a heavy rain with wind (with the rainfly on), moisture got in around every seam between the red lower body and upper white. Can you say Titanic ? Spend your money on a better tent if you expect rain."
5,Incredible,"I find myself gasping for air as I read this book. My poor wife has to deal with me chasing her around the house referring to passages. It is all so simple to see as Mr. Griffin lays out the truth that people in high places do not want us to see. I can see the powers never allowing this book in schools. However, my son is eight years old and by the time he is 16 he will understand what the world is truly about. I owe it to him. Thanks to the author!"
5,I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.,"I could not put this down once I started it. It gives a wonderful history and explanation of our monetary system. I am normally opposed to anything being ""mandantory"", but this is one book that should be required reading for everyone. If you want to discover what is going on behind the scenes in our world today, read this book."
1,Mr. & Mrs. North Volume 9,I would never have purchased this DVD if I had known what poor quality of acting & story line I was purchasing.The program was extremely poor in presentation!! I couldn't watch 15 minutes of it.!I had good memories ...so I thought...of Mr. & Mrs. North...but this DVD & volume was way belowstandard..it was cheap & artifical in performances!!! How do I get my money back?!! $7.98 wasted.... we should be PAID to watch this!!
4,razor cell phone shell,I am very happy with this phone protector. It is easy to clip onto my phone. I really like that it is leather. I have had many compliments on the way my phone looks now.
2,Not impressed,"The first thing I baked in this was an angel food cake. It baked fine, but definitely didn't come out easily. I had to scrape and pry it out. Then had to soak the pan overnite and still had to really scrub hard to clean it. Maybe I should have baked some other type of cake first, but I won't make angel food in it anymore."
4,"Unpolished, but fine-grained.","Amy Fleury, Beautiful Trouble (Southern Illinois University Press, 2004)I wasn't quite sure what to make of Beautiful Trouble, the 2004 Crab Orchard First Book Award winner, for the first few pages. Once I got into the rhythm of Amy Fleury's poetry, however, it was like a wire tripped in my head, and I devoured the rest of the book in one sitting. Fleury is at her best in the last section of the book, where her triple obsessions of sensuality, rural life, and time all converge:""Once again we stumble outof sheet tangle and the dross of dreams.Daylight comes in little sipsover the lip of the bitter cup.It is enough to sustain us.It is enough to know thatwe will go out againwith all our failings and loose change,dazzled and hopefulin the splendor of the sun.""(""Aubade"")Solid stuff, worth reading, with a real honesty to it: this is unvarnished in the best of ways, like a bare floor capable of giving you splinters, but still attractive enough that you refuse to carpet it. ***"
5,The best marvel novel there was,"This book was action packed. This the best team up since the Time Arrow Trilogy, with the X-Men and Spider Man. A must have for all Marvel readers."
3,"A nice, if anticlimactic, team-up (mild spoilers)","A fairly good novel by Askegren, with the two superteams joining forces amid mutual distrust to fight Barons Zemo and Strucker.Unfortunately, the end goes out with a whimper rather than a bang; that this managed to happen even during a fight in Hydra's secret headquarters is a bit of a surprise."
4,"Action packed , that captures the essence of both groups.","Avengers/Thunderbolts By Pierce Askegren was a pleasnt surprise. The story picks up immediately after this months Avengers-T-Bolts meeting in the pages of Avengers #12. There were a few bad points to the book, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but they were minor inconveniences at best. (Captain America having his real shield, instead of his electronic Photon shield,Wonderman acting like his old WCA Jerk self, instead of the character he matured into, and Vision being taken captive, which tends to be a bit annoying these days, as everyone seems to be able to either harm Vision, or make him thier hostage) The fight scenes were excellent, especially Visions battle with Techno. The Thor battle was exceptional as well. All around a very, very good Marvel Novel. I highly reccomend it."
2,Adhesive issue,"Something is wrong with the adhesive or the adhesive strip on these envelopes. When you go to remove the adhesive strip it actually pulls the adhesive off of the envelope. You have to go VERY slowly and then if it still does it, start from the other side. Half the time I end up using tape because the adhesive is half missing. NOT what I want. The last envelopes I used I could tear the strip off super fast and never had an issue. Will not order these again!"
1,"rotten product, even the adhesive doesn't adhere","These were not 8.5 x 12 in any universe I know. The usable space is less than 8.5 x 11 from Staples. The response of the seller? The size ""includes"" the flap. They also wouldn't take them back without charging additional shipping. Don't do it."
1,Be Careful who you order from.,"I Don't use a whole lot of this size so it took a while to realize i got duped, there is no product consistency in the product amazon represents, Go beyond cost and chose the most respectable seller. I Bought these from Yoyoink and got a brittle kraft mailer, import JUNK!"
5,Economical,Excellent value for the money! I regularly use these mailers and like to be able to buy them in larger quantity then I can get at a store such as WalMart.
5,Great Shipping Supply,I have used about 25 envelopes so far. My customers are pleased with my shipping preference. Thanks for providing supplies at low prices.
4,"Bubble Mailers, work with creases","These are fine, except they have some of them have some creases on the fronts, making it a little difficult to write addresses - have to make sure the crease doesn't affect the info the post office needs!"
4,Good Product,"This is a good product, just what I was looking for. It is as described in the listing. I received in a timely manor, boxed packaging."
2,Not #2 envelopes as advertised but they'll do...,"Bought these from a company called ""YoYoink"" on Amazon trying to save a buck and what I got was a craft bubble mailer that is about 3/4"" narrower than previous #2 mailers I had received from ""Valuemailers"". Not to happy about the size difference but they'll do until I need more."
2,Generic Bubble Mailers?,"I didn't realize bubble mailers could be generic, but I was wrong. I came to these guys because of the price, and I was surprised how fast I received my items. That was the good part.The bad part is they are the thinnest bubble mailers I have ever seen. I think someone went and poked out all the bubbles. The peel off sticker is a low grade too. I send out about 100 pieces a month so I'm praying that nothing gets damaged this coming month because of the mailers. If you have anything fragile, it's a good idea to stay away from these and purchase the Actual Kraft Bubble Mailers. I'm still not sure how they claim these are Kraft Bubble Mailers. The stock picture shown is actually a different item altogether."
4,GREAT deal for the price!,"I've started mailing out a lot of DVDs and books, and the #2 mailers at my local store are over a dollar each. These are very similar in quality and the same size. The glue seal holds well. The mailers are a little more thin than the dollar mailers, but still provide good protection for the DVDs. We've also had some bad weather here recently, and a few of my mailers got some rain sprinkled on them. The water did not go through. Overall, I'm very pleased and will definitely buy these again!"
2,lousy glue,I have to tape up every package because the adhesive doesn't stay sticky for long and the package will open up easily.
3,Mailer,I was a bit disappointed with this product. Bubble wrap lining was not as thick as other mailers that I have purchased.
5,Good response to problem,My initial order had a problem but it was handled quickly and fairly. The envelopes were in good shape on arrival. These are very handy for mailing books.
3,Sturdy envelopes; adhesive not so good.,"A good, sturdy enveloped, but the adhesive tear off strip sticks, making it difficult to use. I end up taping the envelope...not what I bargained for."
2,Poor quality envelopes unsuitable,"I sell books and movies on Amazon. In the past I've used Kraft bubble mailers and Scott bubble mailers with no complaint. They are strong and adequate. I ordered these ""#2 Kraft bubble mailers"" thinking they would be the same as from other sellers I've used. Unfortunately, these are much thinner, lighter weight and fragile. They ahve no markings to indicate they are indeed by Kraft. Almost every one I've used has actually torn at the flap and/or at the corners during packaging. This is not due to trying to cram a tight fitting item into the envelope. The paper is simply inferior and, also, the bubbles appear to be minutely smaller. I have to re-enforce the flaps and corners now and pray that the items reach destination safely. Needless to say, I'll not buy these cheaper envelopes again."
4,Very lush and beautiful electronic music,"During the 1980's Maurice Jarre picked up on a somewhat popular concept (and perhaps inspiration from his son, Jean-Michel) and scored a few films using mostly synthesizers and what he called an ""electronic ensemble"" featuring Nyle Steiner, Michael Boddicker, Ian Underwood and others. Some of the scores worked very well on film (Fatal Attraction) while others did not (Dead Poet's Society).Witness is one of the scores on the positive end. It contains some the most lush and beautiful passages ever heard from electronic instruments, and some nice themes. I would rate the film 5 stars (instead of 4) except that there really isn't that much music to listen to when just putting the CD on the stereo and listening. Though not a single track on here will annoy anyone, and the Main Theme and Building the Barn are both worth the price of admission, and make this album well worth owning."
1,Barn music,"The version of ""(What A) Wonderful World"" in the movie was not by Sam Cooke, it was the Greg Chapman cover. Which defies all reason."
3,NEED HELP,"CAN SOMEONE PLEASEEEEEEE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE SONG IN THE MOVIE, WITNESS.......THE ONE SUNG IN THE BARN, WHERE HARRISON FORD AND KELLY MCGILLIS ARE DANCING?????....IT BEGINS WITH, DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HISTORY, DONT KNOW MUCH GEOGRAPHY, ETC ETC......THANKS"
1,wonderful world,"Thank you thank you thank you to the people who named the Sam Cooke song Wonderful World on their reviews, I've been trying to find that song FOREVER and couldn't figure out who sang it! I hope that helps other people too!"
1,A terrible way for Microprose to end its simulation line.,"I was really desprite to get this game because I wanted ahelicopter Gunship game. I had Commanche Gold but that was good for beginers. I wanted something more advanced. I bought this.Here is my two cents. This game was terrible. DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE SAYING IT IS GOOD. If you really want a good Attack helicopter game get ""Eenemy Engaged: RAH-66 Commanche vs. Ka-52 Hokum B: Aligator"" Long name but good game. Now back to Gunship. As everyone said the waypoont system just plain doesn't work, you have to go through a whole menu system and it only worked for me during the demo. The CP/G is a usless jerk who never does anything you say. And if you play as the CP/G the pilot always gets you killed. Firing a missile at the target YOU want is nearly impossible and for [the price] this is just a real rip off.So in a summary all I can say is don't buy this buy somethiung else..."
2,No Way for WayPoint,"I believe I could have liked this game if I could only have figured out where the heck I was going and where the next (or even the first) target was. The WayPoint ruined this game for me. I'm taking it back tomorrow and trading for something else. Watch out for slick packaging, folks!"
4,One of the BEST!,"MicroProse delivers again! One of the best helicopter sims out there. Rivaled by maybe only Hind. Finally a sim with intelligent enemy AI. The emeny tanks and apcs actually take protective measures! Excellant graphics. The flight characteristics are superb. It actually flies like a real chopper. A full range of options to set the realism to your liking. If you don't want to crash, so be it. If you want to be challenged you can be. It would have gotten 5 stars but the waypoints were difficult to figure out. Better manual would have helped."
1,"The game itself, I could do with out.","The place I bought it from treated me well, and I got fast, efficient service. It's not their fault that the game wasn't compatible w/my newer computer. I was much happier w/my old C64 version."
1,Disappointed,"The Commodore 64 version of gun peeked my interests in Helicopters and I as I got older I couldnt wait to see what Microprose could produce with todays technology. IN fact its probably one of the reasons why I do what I do today(helicopter pilot). HOWEVER, I was and still am very disappointed in Gunship. The graphics are great, equal that of Apache Havoc. The realistic flight mode is a joke. The intent is there, the game play seems to be OK. But the game itself is to complex. Not enough keyboard commands, not enough realistic flight modes. I recommend Longbow 2 still an awesome game, realism is there, and Apache Havoc for gameplay. Hard core sim players PLEASE overlook Gunship. Save your money!"
2,bad mvalue for money spent,"Were it only for the music on these eight discs, my rating would be five stars. Unfortunately, I, like most people, am not rich and cannot throw money away indiscriminately. The average running time for each disc is under 50 minutes. When CDs can hold over 70 minutess, this is unacceptable, especially for analog recordings. And the price here is very high. You can find this set for almost $30 cheaper elsewhere on the internet."
1,Big Disappointment,"I have been awaiting this book, having knit various projects from all of Melville's previous books. But...I pored over the book for an hour, and found nothing that I believed was worth knitting. To me, many of the patterns were ugly, unstylish, and dated. I'm a huge fan of Melville's and the clairty with which she writes patterns and explains techniques. But for those who want to enliven their knitting with using more than one color, I'm afraid this book doesn't deliver."
2,Dissapointment,"I loved Sally's previous books , espesially ""The Purl Stitch"" , and was eager to buy this one. However , I am dissapointed with the garrments/patterns. There is nothing in the book I'd like to knit. I am sorry, but some of the designs are just hideous - I do not know of a woman who would like to wear a top with huge fishes on it.The good thing about the book are Sally's essays and beautiful photography of Santorini."
5,The Knitting Experience: Book 3: Color,"I purchased this book after seeing a lady in the airport, who was wearing the exact sweater on the cover of the book. She was kind enough to give me the book name and I ordered it that day. I must make this sweater!! After receiving the book, there is a lot more knitting information included along with some wonderful ""color"" patterns. Well worth the price!"
2,Fantastic instruction for hideous patterns,"You'll find some of the best instructions for color knitting in this book (3 ways to knit Fair Isle, etc.). Unfortunately, you won't be inspired to knit any of the patterns with your newfound knowledge. Buy the book for the great, clear directions and then go knit something else."
1,Not up to Sally's Standards,"Like many other reviewers, I am a fan of Sally Melville's. I've been knitting for over 25 years, and purchased the Knit Stitch to help me to teach other people to knit. Her illustrations and directions in that book were fabulous. I recommended the book to new and old knitters alike, and every female friend of mine received a Sally scarf one holiday.However, I took a knitting class with Sally at Stitches, and while I loved her, I did not like her sense of color. This book should not have been made. It does not do her justice nor does it showcase her strengths. The designs are very staid and the colors are ugly or boring. Buy her Knit or Purl books - this book is a dud."
1,only get it if you like fair isle---not me,"sorry, but after the first two STELLAR books, I had hoped for more. it's great if you like color work (think fair isle and one yarn color in one hand and a second color in the other). nope, not for me. going to buy a book on aran knitting (one color, ahhh) instead."
5,Pictures don't do these beautiful sweaters justice,"I just took a class on color knitting with Sally Melville, and had a chance to see some of the sweaters from this book up close and personal. They are gorgeous.It caused me to take a second look at book 3 of her series. As usual, Sally's instructions are A+, clear, precise, but also friendly and encouraging. And her meditations on knitting provide any knitter with inspiration about the her craft and process.Ignore the teen-aged models in designer jeans, and take a close look at the knitted pieces in this collection, and you may find the seeds for creating your own colored heirloom."
5,Another Winner,"I own and use all of Sally Melville's knitting books. I have been a knitter since my Grand'mere taught me at age 6. Melville's ""Book 3:Color"" is a stunningly beautiful book just to leaf through, but the best part is that it contains patterns for items that I would actually WEAR. Sally explains not only about working with color in a way that dispels the ""old color wheel"" method, but incorporates new color wheel thinking and shows us with examples. She gives us the tools to change our thinking about color. I especially like the section on varigated yarns; her explanation of the short, medium and long repeats and how they affect the pattern. I also really like the Skills photos--very easy to follow. A terrific addition to any serious knitter's library. Highly recommended."
2,Little inspiration,"As a great fan of Sally Melville's 2 previous books on knit and purl stitches, I was looking forward to this latest offering, only to be disappointed. Guess I never realized that there are very many needleworkers who are intimidated by working with color. If so, I suppose the guidelines spelled out here might be useful. But the projects and patterns are so ordinary and run-of-the-mill as to be entirely uninspiring. I love to add new books to my knitting library but am giving Book3: Color a miss."
4,A Solid New Spongebob,"I own this DVD, and i thought some episodes were hilarious! My favorite being Spy Buddies. There are tons of great jokes. I also liked Rise and Shine, a four-minute short about Patrick's ""daily"" routine. It's really funny too. The downside to this DVD is that it has flaws too. I thought the episode The Original Fry Cook wasn't very good, and it didn't have jokes! Fungus Among Us is an iffy episode at best. It's point isn't very good for the kids who are really into this TV Show. Night Light is another pretty good episode involving Spongebob getting scared by a book before bedtime. It's very funny because he brings many different lights into the house and uses them to wake up all the neighbors (not intended). All in all, a solid DVD buy it!"
4,"This is a great book for basic, useful information","I LOVE this book. I have a business teaching women relaxation and skin care techniques at in-home Spa Parties and found that the information here was basic enough to offer to my clients without being overwhelming. Let's face it; what product out there doesn't tell you it will solve all your aging issues? I like the fact that she doesn't list products to scurry out and buy, but gives you general things to look for.Carolyn's book is divided into chapters that allow you to choose the info you need right now, and then go back later for additional information when you can digest it. I also had the opportunity to hear her speak and then visit with her for a few moments at the Natural Bodycare Convention this summer. She was just as helpful in person as she is on paper.This is a great book and I'm looking forward to the release of her next one."
3,Ok,More of a beginners look at world war 2 in general and the Battle of the Bulge. Does do a good job of explaining troop movements and a very basic overview of the battle...very short.-not bob levy
3,Editing,"Can't believe this author (and Osprey editors) continually misspell the name of W/SS Gruppenfuehrer Hermann Priess, Ritterkreuz holder, it's annoying..."
4,African world,This was a very informative book. A well thought out guide on the vast history of black women. Ivan Van Sertima's arrangement of research is great i recommend to any history seeker.
3,Should have payed more attention,"I bought this as a gift for my friend's baby shower. I didn't notice that it is SMALL until it arrived. It's about the size of a Passport, so please be advised. It still worked for my purposes, but I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I had noticed."
5,So Cute!,"I bought this book for my daughter and I to read to the baby I am expecting. We love Dr. Seuss in my house and this one is perfect. It is the baby's first book, and my daughter is entertained because she knows most of the characters that this book mentions. Yes, the book is rather small, but that is okay. It doesn't really bother me or my daughter. I am glad I found this book and will have it as a keepsake for the new baby. We really wanted to continue my daughter's love of reading with the next baby and I think this is a great way!"
3,Small,The book is so tiny.. about the size of the palm of your hand. Cute but I was expecting a regular size book.
2,Size does maters,"The book itself is one of the best kids books out there, but after opening the box and seeing it is actually a pocket size book, both my daughter and I were a little disappointed, yes mostly me because my daughter at the bookstore loved the book, nut at home when she got it she did not pay attention to it for more than a few minutes, where as when she gets regular size books she would be hunting for people to read it to.It would be very helpful if there was a description specifying the tininess of it."
1,BUYER BEWARE THIS BOOK IS MINIATURE,"I cannot express how disappointed I was when I received this book. It is extremely small. I was looking forward to giving this to my friend for her baby shower, but am too embarrassed to give it to her as it would seem I had ""cheaped out"" on her. Absolutely a let-down."
5,Reading from the beginning...,"While we are both avid readers, my husband and I were definately moved at the idea of reading to our baby while in utero. It was a great way to start reading all those wonderful books again and learning the language that we had let go. Our child has not stopped looking at books and learning from them. Now she is a year and we are thrilled that she picks up books all the time. Thanks Dr. Seuss!"
2,meh,it's a giant commercial for the other Dr Seuss books. Get the originals $ save yourself the cash
2,"By ""Cat in the Hat"" instead","I was disappointed when I received this in the mail.I expected this book to be bigger (it is about 2x4) for one and refer to the baby more. Instead, it refers to characters in Dr. Suess books.Also, this isn't a book I would pick up and read after the baby is born. I would rather read books out loud that I am more likely to continue to read to the baby when it is born, that is benefit to reading in utero anyway.This is a cute ""basket"" gift for a shower, but if you are looking for a book to connect with your baby, I would pass on ""Oh baby.."""
3,ok,"The book is very cute and my daughter and I enjoy reading this story to the baby. I was a little disapointed in the fact that this book is very small and not regular dr. seuss sized. The book doesn't go with my collection due to it's size and it was not in very good condition, which could have happened during shipping but still don't list it in excellent condition if it is not."
3,Oh Baby,Great DR. Seuss book but a very small copy. Arrived quickly and it perfect shape but was dissappointed in the size of book.
2,"Not by Seuss, nice prose, VERY SMALL","While not written by Seuss, the prose is jaunty and fun. However, the book is TINY! It's definitely a ""gift book"" size and not something you'll be able to pick up and read to your vision-impaired newborn. I'll buy Cat in the Hat next time."
1,just an advertisement,"I love Dr. Seuss more than anybody. I have almost all of his books. I was so very disappointed with this book. I searched for it while I was pregnant with my first child but could only find Oh, The Places You'll Go! which I love. When I became pregnant again I finally found this book only for it to basically be an advertisement for all the other books. I guess I had expected it to be meaningful like Oh, The Places You'll Go! So for anybody out there that is expecting it to be similar, it is not. It is probably a good book for most, but for me it was just a disappointment."
3,"Great for a baby in utero, but......","Not too great for a toddler!!! When I first ordered this book, I thought it was the original one, not one that was to be read in utero. I was also suprised at how tiny the book was.I got this book AFTER my daughter was born, so I never actually got the chance to read it to her while she was still in the womb. I recently started to read this book to my daughter a few months ago, she was a little over 1 year.She dosen't seem to enjoy it very much and I think the book is way too long to hold her interest. I also think some of the language and rhyming is a little hard for her to grasp.My recommendation is that if you want to purchase this book, do it while your baby is in utero and read it to him/her until the birth. After the birth, get the original version."
1,Not impressed,"I expected something consistent with Oh, the Places You'll Go. This definitely did not meet my expectations. I did not like it."
3,"Very Small, Very Long","It's a cute book but rather small and seems very long. It's ok, not planning on reading it often though."
3,okay,This is a cute book to introduce dr. seuss characters to your baby. It definitly isn't my favorite dr. seuss book though.
5,Such a sweet little book,"This is a really cute book, my husband loves to read it to our baby in my belly. It is small, but that is clearly written in the description. I love it."
4,Cute book for expecting mothers.,"We read this book to the baby often throughout the pregnancy. It made me cry toward the end of the pregnancy because it is so sweet with the ""I can't wait to meet you!"" line.When our daughter was born, I read it to her in the hospital and she stared intently at me, calm as can be, listening to me read it, face-to-face. It was a great bonding experience and a very cute book.This book reads from cover-to-cover in less than ten minutes and serves as a gateway to the world of Seuss by introducing various Dr. Seuss characters, and it has the same tongue-twisting phrases and made up words traditional to all Seuss classics. Though it was not written by Dr. Seuss himself, they did a nice job."
3,tiny book!,"This isn't a full size book, it's VERY small. It DOES say that the book dimensions are: 5.2 x 0.3 x 5.8 inches I just never thought to check the size when ordering books! Still cute & unborn baby can't see the pictures anyways :)"
3,Great book BUT order another size!,"The book is wonderful, just beware that it is TINY! Pocket size.I didn't realize that when I ordered and was so disappointed when I opened the package."
3,Nice book but VERY small!,"I like the story and the book of the book but be prepared, the book is very small. I was shocked at the size!"
4,Cute book,"Very sweet book for baby's first book. But also very tiny - it's not much bigger than 4 1/2"" - 5"" tall. I was quite surprised at the petite size. I wouldn't give it as a baby shower gift, unless it was accompanying another gift.The story is great and the illustrations are fun. Overall a nice book."
2,"Oh Baby, here's a list of Dr. Suess characters...","While this book starts off cute, it is a far cry from capturing the spirit of the original ""Oh, the Places You'll Go."" While the original is inspirational , the baby version is not much more than a laundry list of Dr. Suess characters the baby will meet when Mom and Dad read to it. There really is nothing inspirational or exceptional about it. When my husband was reading it to the baby, I kept waiting to tear up with the hope it would promise. Instead, I grew impatient waiting for him to finish the long long list of Dr. Suess characters the baby will meet. Definitely not at all what we expected."
2,"Disappointed - not very ""Seuss-ical""","While the book is conceptually a Seuss (hence the two stars v. just one), neither the artwork nor the story really is. It actually seemed a bit more like a mini-advertisement for the other works of Seuss rather than a true Seuss book being that it is more of a list of other characters and complete devoid of any real story.A novelty at best. Stick to the true ""Oh, the Places You'll Go!""."
3,its cute but..,"Its cute. I was using this as a baby shower gift (instead of a card, write a letter in the book) but I guess I didn't pay attention to how SMALL the book is. Its so little you can only write a few sentences I suppose. I guess I was just expecting it to be a regular size dr. seuss book. Oh well, the book itself is still cute..."
4,It's Adorable,"I too really enjoy reading this book to my unborn. It is short, sweet and uplifting. The perfect book to lift up your child."
4,Dr. Seuss never disappoints,This is a small book not regular sized so it is is hard to share with a anyone but still a fun read
3,Dr. Seuss,"Too small, arrived quickly, but it is a pocket size book. I thought that it was going to a regular size book. Really disappointed"
3,DR. SEUSS,"CUTE STORY...BOUGHT AS A BABY SHOWER GIFT. WAS JUST DISAPPOINTED ON THE SIZE, BUT IT WAS MY FAULT FOR NOT READING THE DESCRIPTION."
5,Fantastic as well as emotional!,"I received this book as a gift from a coworker when I was about 4 months pregnant. I have read it almost daily to my unborn child and I love the feeling it gives me to read it and know that my child is listening! I am almost 6 months pregnant, and with the baby kicking me constantly, I am reminded that he wants to hear his favorite book! I love the creativity within this book, the emotions it brings while reading it, and the idea that my child is reading already! It isn't expensive nor does it take all day to read. Highly recommended!"
1,Just an Advertisement for other DS Books,"I was disappointed to discover that this book was so small, and basically just an advertisement for all the other Dr Seuss books. It wasn't even written by DS. I don't feel it was worth the money. You shouldn't have to pay for ads."
2,"Good message, tiny book",Maybe i missed the description but this book is tiny. I assumed it was a full size book but its about the size of an open hand. Good message in book but not what i expected
4,Gift,I ordered this for a friend to give to someone who is having a baby. She said she has this book and really liked it.
2,The book was unexpectedly min-sized!!,"The book was unexpectedly min-sized!!! Had I known, I would have bought another. The words are the same - fabulous Dr. Seuss - but the package matters, too. This was intended as a gift and turned out to be more like the gift card."
4,Cute little book,This book is small; about 5x6 in. I thought it would be bigger like the other Dr. Seuss's books. The story is interesting and entertaining. Young kids will likely enjoy it.
2,"Don't Expect Much - Though There is Joanna Kerns ""Nudity""","The movie is laughable inept so don't expect too much. It offers less special effects than most Godzilla movies but if you're a fan of Joanna Kerns, I believe this is her only ""nudity"" though frankly, it's not much, during a medium shot in an attempt to seduce someone in a lab she pulls open her blouse revealing her see-through bra. Keep in mind that it's a medium shot and the print is not exactly pristine so it's not much but this might qualify as her only nude scene so there's your reason to view this film."
1,let's be honest,"There should be two kinds of reviews. One for movies you like but that are bad, and one for movies that are not bad enough to fall into that category. This movie sucks, so it falls into the former. It sucks so badly, though, you might actually enjoy it. But by any objective criterion, it is truly horrible. And thus one star."
4,"This DVD is a flat version of a 3-D movie, but still fun","A*P*E was filmed and originally released in 3-D, and isn't as interesting when seen in the flattened out version on DVD, but if you like bad, really bad movies, you need to see it! I love the shark, but the best has got to be the guinea pig painted to look like a cow...For maximum fun, track down the 3-D version."
1,Oh gosh!,Not my cup of tea! No doubt the quality is good. But soooooooooooooo strong. Where is the delicate tea?
3,Not what I expected,"Good clean copy for such an old propaganda video. Easy to hear, good soundtrack. BUT was VERY dry. I bought this to augment/enrich my High School curriculum on nuclear power but it is too long and obtuse for that. Fascinating for an interested adult, but excruciating for an uninterested teenagers."
3,It was okay,The product came on time and is a useful guide. I found it helpful in my journey. Anyone can use it.
1,settle that camera down,"I agree that this is the worst fireplace video of them all. The makers just don't seem to understand that if watching a real fireplace is soothing and cozy then they should try to recreate that experience. They don't. Instead they fade shots in and out, most of which are annoyingly close up (as though you are sitting with your nose an inch from the fire). Just as you are adjusting to the shot and starting to relax, the shot switches again. It's like sitting to down to watch a fireplace and having to move to a totally different part of the room every minute or so. That wouldn't be relaxing, and neither is this DVD."
1,Fire hazard,"What is this? I bought the dvd on impulse during a 5-min ""pick-up-something-else-run"" at the videoshop.The dvd consists out of nothing else but ridiculously close shots of a burning fire. 95% of the time the images are taken in angle in which you would have been admitted to the severe burns trauma center if you had filmed it yourself! Nowhere on this dvd do you see an actual full size, normal fire burning... and you may forget seeing the flames dance because they're always shot in close-up or from a weird angle. The dvd does not ""flow"" but is rather a cut-and-paste job of bad images that jumps into many different angles but not a normal-eye view ... not relaxing at all.The only OK thing is the music, but not the christmas version cause that's a mix of butchered european classics! And trust me, I'm from Euope and I know my songs! LOL Unless you have $20.00 regret-money to spend, this will be a very big disappointment..."
4,Perfect ambiance!,"I have to be honest and say I had some reservations when I bought this DVD to add a little more atmosphere to a winter holiday party. I guess I figured it might be a little cheesy. Happily, though, I was dead wrong. This is truly a well put-together production that really takes advantage of the DVD format to offer you not only a choice of screen formats, but also a choice of both classical or baroque-style Christmas music mixed in with the flames, or - if you prefer - nothing but the sound of the crackling fire. Bottom line: a great accompaniment to any winter occasion; whether it's a holiday party or simply something to have on in the background while you chat, cook, read a book, or do whatever. And - unlike a movie - this is something you can enjoy all night long, over and over again. My advice: a definite ""buy""."
4,"Buy it, play it and relax.","Frankly, I'm a little puzzled by the other reviews of Fireplace - Visions of Tranquility. This DVD offers about as realistic a fire as one could expect on a TV screen. I liked the variety of angles and close-up views. No, you never see the entire fireplace, but if you did, the fire would be miniscule on the TV screen. The producers even went to the added expense of shooting the fire on film to better capture the subtleties of colors in the flames. You also get versions, 16:1 widescreen and 4:3 pan & scan. Sure you can play your own music for additional flavor, but the DVD comes with two music tracks. You can choose baroque Christmas music or a relaxing night music track. Both tracks play with or without a crackling fire sound effect, in your choice of 5.1. 2.0 and DTS surround sound. How many more choices do you want? Buy it. Play it. And relax."
3,Add a touch of Christmas music!,"I was, at first, disappointed with this DVD, primarily because it consists totally of close-up shots of a blazing fire in a fireplace. Some in-out panning would have decreased the boredom.However, I combined this DVD along with some very good Christmas music, and lit an aroma candle. Then I leaned back, watched, listened, smelled, and did some very serious, pleasant daydreaming."
4,Relaxing realistic sound and picture,I bought this DVD to put on during our family Christmas and everyone loved it. I mostly wanted it for warm background sound (I used the fireplace sound only option) and to make the TV less of a black hole in the living room. It worked great! It's also very relaxing for those of us who like to go to sleep with the TV on but don't want to be distracted by actual TV shows or movie playing. Nice soothing VERY realistic sound. I found the Christmas music option not very soothing but the night music is okay.
1,Wasted Money,"This was a pathetic excuse for a DVD. From the instant it started to play, I knew I had wasted my money on a piece of crap. After watching the DVD, I went to a friend's house and made a better film on MiniDV. PLEASE DON'T BUY! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Tranquil? More like disturbing.,"This video is divided into segments of a real fire. Why divid it up into segments? I'm guessing they were going for the modern impressionistic surrealism angle. Instead of a pleasant video of a fire place you end up with a bad art school project. A long close up of a burning log? I've never seen anyone stick their face four inches from the fire to view it. A close up of a fire is not tranquil. It's disturbing. Panning across the burning logs??? Not quite as disturbing as the close up. But you tried. The best part of this DVD is the picture on the front of the case.There are several really nice fire scenes. But over all not worth owning. If you can get a seller to give it to you for free and pay shipping it would be worth having. You'd end up with a spare case to put a good DVD in. Oh ya, and the picture on the front."
3,"Great view, inappropriate music","The variety of fireplace views and choices are very nice and peaceful along with the crackling sound. However, the style of Christmas music is a poor choice for relaxation. The music is up beat and fast paced which contradicts the purpose of relaxing in front of a fire. I can only enjoy this fireplace setting by keeping the music off. I like the fireplace video by itself, but I cannot recommend the DVD as a whole due to the mismatch of the music."
1,Unsupported book :(,The accompanying web site is unreachable. Most examples are based on a commercial package (TicleMan)
1,Can't get sample source code,"I failed to get the example source codes listed in the book by following the exact instructions of the book. In addition, I can't contact auther for this."
2,Wow...Who Green Lighted This?,"If you love awful movies that are fun in their awfulness, this one's perfect. The acting is bad, the story is too and the Bobby Vinton soundtrack is one for the ages. There's nothing more ironic than songs about ""Lemon Drops, Lollipops and Sunbeams"" sung by someone who sounds like they're clinically depressed. On the plus side, Goldie Hawn wears next to nothing and bends, lifts or pushes aside her costumes in almost every scene."
1,Unacceptable rip-off,"I chose the provider because of the good reviews, and so far, I have had good experiences with purchase on Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I received a region 1 DVD, whereas neither the description, nor my purchase proof mentioned the region to be region 1. I live in an area within region 2, and the DVD was dispatched from Amsterdam, NL, also in region 2. I contacted the company, who sent me their order copy, which indeed specified the region, but despite mailing them my copy and referring to the missing specifics regrading the region codes in the DVD description, the company will not budge. The best offer I received was to return the DVD at my ow expense for a refund of the cost of the DVD, not including the shipping costs. Also note that the DVD seems suspiciously like a copy, and not an original. I am hugely disappointed and rather angry at the stance the company has taken."
1,big-big desapointing,"Donot trust AMAZON!Whan You open thare side, They will immediatly send yop a bill.And no chans to cansel it.I try it aftore 10 min , call tham . No Way for halp.Be coushan!!They not halp you. They need You money, that all.And no way to communicated ."
3,"Goofy film, I know....I was in the film!","This film was shot in Colorado in 1975 and I was an extra. Shot in Central City and the Oxford Hotel in Denver, I worked in the film for a couple of weeks. It was interesting that a major Hollywood release was being conceived as it was being shot. A mess of a film. The ending is abrupt, the cowboys and principal players speak in contemporary dialogue, and originality was totally missing. George Segal was a pleasureand Goldie was totally unapproachable.Good cinematography and locations, but a real piece of fluff..could have been so much better, but Melvin Frank, the director, was ill during the shoot (respiratory problems)and the A.D.s were doing most of the work."
5,One of Her Best,"This is one of Goldie's best movies. The caste line up is great as well as the acting. Goldie plays a great shmutt of a dutchess (and you can touch me cherries, me bananas or me pears....and all me other wares). George Segal is great as well. They make a great team in a western comedy. One of my all time faves. Too bad it has not been released in blu-ray."
4,An amusing Western Style farse,"Goldie Hawn is a dance hall girl with an extracurricular agenda. George Segal is a cheating gamble that seems to always get caught. Not only does he escape a hanging but walks away with the loot from the gang's bank robbery. Goldie and George both want what the other has and the laughs roll like plums.The film is set in San Fransisco and moves to Utah as Goldie disguises as a duchess to impress a wealthy Mormon, with more wives than he can count. The situation is set, as Goldie and George run from the outlaws whose money she misappropriated from George and toward Utah and the new life.A good Goldie, very laughable and a very entertaining movie."
4,One Funny Lady,Goldy Hawn is at her typical delightfully funny self in this romp. She plays the clever lines to T. and does so with her special style.
4,As much an historical document as a pleasurable experience.,"This classic complete recording (CD re-issue) of Tony Bennett's historical recording is also truly a pleasurable listening experience. Many of the tunes will probably be new, and many may feel dated, but all have the charm and energy that Tony Bennett has yet to lose."
3,the second sun vol 3,I was disappointed when I was reading the third book and it was pushing Mormon beliefs. The book was okay.
5,"This is the BEST in the series. If the other ones got 5 stars, this deserves 6","This is where I feel the story peaked. I was frustrated to not have volume 4 on hand when I finished this one. This book really took me by surprise at the end. The plan of the evil conspirators was genius! I didn't expect such an ending at all! I wish the other ones in the series were this compelling. I rated the others with 3's and 4's except for the first with which I rewarded a 5. If you want to be kept guessing and have a good page turner, this is the one for you."
3,The Second Sun-Chris Stewart,"The book is fine to read but has had water damage. I guess seller had that in the description but I didn't see that before I purchased it. I guess I haven't done this enough to figure out how I missed this info. Anyway, I am busy reading which is what I mostly bought the book for and the price was right! I will pay more attention the next time I order. Thanks"
3,OK,I fell in love with the characters in the first book and couldn't wait to see what happened on Earth. But I was disappointed in the second book and where all the family members ended up. It made the story seem disjointed. The third just got more complicated. Not sure I will read more.
2,Not Highly Recommended,"This book contained a satisfactory review of American History and multiple practice tests. However, the questions on the practice tests were WAY out of line compared to the actual questions on the test. I took one practice tests that had about 1/4 of the questions on farm and labor history, while there were only about 2 questions about farm and labor history on the actual test. I consistently got about half of the questions right on the practice tests, yet I got a 770 on the actual SAT II. This book needlessly panicked me and there must be a better choice."
1,A pathetic compendium of no real use.,"This is also a commentary on the inclusion of Social Studies with American History. The questions given as examples, perhaps representative, force the taker of the test to submit to political correctness: e.g., what is the biggest obstacle to women's rights? By the way, only the most insulting answers need be swallowed (i.e. chosen) and I am by the way, a woman. This test is a not so subtle effort to : 1) reward the student of social engineering; 2) obscure the achievements of the American History scholar with the brainwashed PC product (student) who has memorized and happily accedes to the social engineering questions. American History scholars, take Math II C instead."
5,Great book for C programmers to learn C++,"Even though it is titiled ""Turbo C++"", it is a great reference book for every C++ programmer. Materials are organized nicely. Details are presented in a concise and clear manner. Examples are very instructive. I highly recommend it."
3,Dr. Who - Classic Stuff with an Acceptable DVD Transfer,"A few character changes from the TV series, but still classic stuff if you grew up with the show. The script is tailored for a family audience, so don't expect any sophistication here! But the hairdos and the pure 60s flavor are a nostalgic treat.The anamorphic DVD transfer is quite good for a 60s film, and grain is handled well. It even looks relatively good in home theater projection."
2,Barely adequate entertainment,"Peter Cushing disappoints as a ineffective, grandfatherly Dr. Who. Disastrous attempt at comic relief by bumbling boyfriend fails miserably (think of an English Don Knotts with even less talent). Weak script (borrowing heavily from HG Wells' The Time Machine) features effiminate and campy humans vs. Daleks. On the plus side, the Daleks are amusing in a robotic way (although we learn they are not robots).The sequel, Dalek Invasion, is somewhat better.If you are in the market for low budget British scifi, I'd suggest ""Quartermass and the Pit"" also known as Five Million Years to Earth.Note: I am not a special fan of Dr Who on TV although I have seen it."
1,No redeeming value,"This is based directly on a Doctor Who episode, only with different characters. The beginning is the worst. The not so mysterious Doctor from Earth invented the TARDIS himself!!! My advice to everyone out there, buy the original in black and white with William Hartnell."
2,Talking trash cans will rule the earth!!,"Slo-o-o-o-o-o-owwwww moving, mildly campy feature film adapted from the beloved BBC-TV show. Peter Cushing takes a turn as the semi-dotty Doctor, and the Daleks are appropriately awkward and mechanical. You're better off getting your giggles from the original television episodes."
2,A curiosity piece for Doctor Who fans,"Although I'm a great fan of Peter Cushing, I would have much preferred the original cast of the show in this feature film version of the Doctor's first encounter with The Daleks. My biggest complaint is the way the character of the Doctor has been rewritten for the movie. Instead of a Time Lord from another world, in the movie you get the impression that the Doctor is nothing more than an eccentric inventor. He is not nearly as interesting a character. Cushing plays the Doctor as a lovable, doddering old man. It's a shame because this movie could have been quite good. Instead, it's not much more than a curiousity piece for the die-hard Doctor Who fan."
2,Buy this one only if you are a collector,"As the other reviewers have pointed out, this movie has lots of mistakes in it. Since it was based on a real Dr. Who episode, it has a good story, which is its only redeeming value. The acting is terrible, the intro music wasn't from the show, this one just doesn't seem like Dr. Who. Don't buy it, unless you just want to collect every movie box with ""Dr. Who"" on it."
1,A Sad Recreation,"Overall, this movie was not impressive. The characters seemed to be too stereotypical for my tastes, with the eccentric inventor, the hapless but cute girls, and the clutsy but well-meaning guy.Gone is the mystery of the Doctor and Susan's origins. Gone is the darkness of the script. I know, I know, the original series was a bit lame, but that's because of the budget. The script by itself was suspenseful. This recreation had none of that.In fact, the only thing I find likable about this was the TARDIS' interior. It was an interesting change."
1,Terrible Movie,I am a Dr. Who fan all the way back to the early 70's. I rented this movie from Netflix. All I can say is don't bother with this awful movie. It is only remotely related to the Dr. Who storyline. What a shame. I won't repeat what the other reviewers said other than... exterminate this movie. Exterminate. Exterminaaaaattttte!!!
1,An insult to an excellent Tv series.,"I thought the idea of a re-make was to improve on the original. This film version of what is possibly the most important Dr Who story of all time is no more than a twee, harmless, toy-like embodiment of tedium. It has none of the drama, realism, atmosphere and imagination on the 7-part story it's based on, reduces a thought-provoking tale about a post-nuclear holocaust world to the level of 'goodies' and 'baddies'. The Thals are now uninspiring characters in Julian Clary make-up and the Daleks are now one-dimensional ranting tinpots. True, special effects are improved, but some of the Daleks still have sink-plungers and the characters of the Doctor et al are based on their TV series counterparts in name only. Funny how I used to like this film when I was young. Shows how easily-pleased I was."
4,Leaves defect?,"I own the Bright Leaves disc (standalone) and did not experience any problems. If you're not up on Ross, definitely check out this box. He is one of a kind."
2,"Necomer in Wichita, Ks.","This game is, I think, for the advanced player. In my opinion it's to complex and doesn't offer a variety of optional tables/games. It takes to long to advance levels. Sound effects and music is very good, though. Definitely not for beginners, like me."
3,"Genrally a good text,with some concerns for safety issues.","This book is a good study on how to build a T-bucket by the old ""We used what we had"" school of thought.While this may be able to produce a""car"" for a really low dollar figure,it certainly does'ent build a car that handles well and above all is safe. I mean how much is your life worth! I have to take issue with the use of used tie-rod ends ""welded"" to watter pipe as steering components? come on! This kind of unsafe foolishness is what gave T-buckets a bad name in the 60's."
3,It is for 108 form application not teaching,It was not what I was expecting. I was looking for some wudan tai chi form instruction. This more showed how each form applied to combat situations. It was very enlightening just not what I was expecting.
5,Well done!,"Although I practice Chinese Kung Fu, I'm a beginner in Taiji practice. I got a number of DVD's for Christmas, and this is the one I find I keep coming back to. I was able to take a workshop with Master Zhou in Connecticut last year, and his instruction was great. His humble, friendly and peaceful nature carry over in this DVD -a welcome new addition to the American martial arts scene!"
5,Outstanding DVD!,"I'm so glad that I bought this DVD!I already study Yang style and Chen style Taiji Quan, and I own my share of DVD's but I find that seeing Taiji from a Daoist perspective has greatly added to my personal practice. Master Zhou's presentation of the ancient Wudang form is so graceful! In addition to the form, the other parts of the program are also great. I especially enjoyed Master Zhou's introduction, which talks about Taiji in the greater context of Chinese history and Daoist philosophy. Master Zhou's program also includes a moving version of Zhan Zhuang standing meditation that I'd never seen before. I've added some of the Wudang methods to my daily Taiji practice, and I feel better than ever!"
4,First Rate Production,"This DVD contains a wealth of information which could take much time to digest. The beginning of the DVD puts Tai Chi into historical perspective with visually stunning scenes from China. My favorite part is the sections on Warm-up, Standing and Moving Meditation. Even if I have limited time, I can incorporate these into my routine. My only criticism is that this DVD may be geared to someone who has studied Tai Chi before and wants to delve deeper. For example, the martial applications of the forms are interesting but may not be necessary for a true beginner. Having said this, some beginners may prefer to know the practical application of each form. You should also be aware that while the moves look simple, there are subtleties which should be explored. This is an issue endemic in all instructional DVDs. The viewer could decide to pursue further study through personal instruction. Nevertheless, a solid production."
4,Great products that lasts quite a while,"This is the first Anthony product I bought and I'm really happy with it. The scent is pleasant and you get a real clean feel when using it. Just watch for pricing, because some are slightly more expensive but offer free shipping."
3,Decent Bar,This is a pretty good glycerin bar. Why did I spend $8 on a glycerin bar and not $3 in the drug store? Good question! I got it for free as a gift in a promo bag. Would I buy it again? No. Did I like if for free? YES!
5,Gift for my husband.,I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. It smells very nice and he's very happy with it. Love that its 100% vegetable based.
3,Too expensive...,"I did not find any benefit over cheaper glycerin face bars like this one:Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar Bonus Pack, Original Formula - 6 ea"
5,who would think about soap,"So I just got tired of the safe---- and the irish---- and all the other over the counter soaps made for men. I went online and found this guy who reviews mens products, and tried many of the ones he tested, some he liked some not. I found him to be spot on when it came to this soap. I was buying this from a resource on the west coast but there supply sometimes was light, I would buy ten they would ship six. I now buy it through amazon and have no issues. I turned my dad onto this soap and my cousin, and they both now use it exclusively. When I have company stay over they always comment positively about it. Now it's pricey, has actually doubled in price since I started buying it, but it lasts and I don't need shampoo it does a great job on my reasonably full head of hair. I won't use anything else again."
3,"An OK reference, but not complete.","I purchased this book mainly for the discussion on ASPI and it gives a good introduction on the subject. However, the book contains no complete, comprehensive listing of ASPI structures and SCSI commands in an appendix which would be very helpful as a reference. You will have to locate needed information in the text. The text itself is easy to understand, but the author's attempt at humor is somewhat bland (sorry, if you're reading this...) and at times the text can feel a little childish and over-enthusiastic, sort of like a grandfather describing to his grandson the virtues of Santa Claus. However, language is secondary to material. Put in that appendix and I would recommend this book."
1,Review of Programmer's Guide To SCSI,"Very thin, only 292 pages. Only 14 pages dedicated to Windows programming. Much of the programming information can be found in ASPI kit or DevStudio. This book is more suited to someone who does not know anything or very little about SCSI and wants to get their feet wet with a little programming. Seasoned programmers will find that it lacks beef."
1,Pretty useless compared to other references,"I loaned this book from the library, and was quite happy to have saved money. This book gives you a few definitions of what SCSI is about, but it stops right there. Pretty much useless for a programmer, very little about ASPI or CAM, or whatever, and just a code dump of a Linux tidbits copied from the web. Not too strong. And not much about IOCTL..."
3,A Good Starter For Project Execution,"This planner is good starter for any business executive when appointed to work on a project but do not know from where to start. This book included collection of forms to follow. Included also a booklet to tell you how to use it. Especially for those who have no previous project management experience. For one thing, I would like to see if they are going to publish this book again for next edition,a CD-Rom included with all the form in either spreadsheet and/or word processor format. For if they can develope an interactive accompanying program would be perfect. This book when use together with another title ""The Noah Project"" by the same author is a perfect couple for beginners."
5,A breath of fresh air,"This show is a breath of fresh air. I would sleep in on Saturday's, but not after I saw this. I am 25 and set my alarm for this morning cartoon. Like most of the comments for this show the storytelling is done by experts. Bruce Timm did a fantastic job with Superman and Batman (The animated series) and he is doing it again here. I just finished watching those shows and HIGHLY recommend them to anyone that loves the GL show. Sure they are older, from the 90's, but they read just like the GL show. I laugh and cry during each episode. Can't wait for next Saturday!!! =]"
5,Green Lantern's Light,"i really got into this tv series because it's the 1st of it's kind in DC Comics history to actually get it's own show instead of Justice League or BatMan Brave & The Bold which quite frankly looked stupid unlike The BatMan with Rino Romano anyway, Green Lantern is a one hero branching off from SuperMan & BatMan & Justice League which gave it credibility to do wonderful for kids & not just kids us adults as well. This show gets 5 stars from me & it's message it's story it's lesson to every young & wise person out there is. Don't be afraid of fear, you must Will the power of Will so it can fear you. In Brightest & Blackest Night, No Evil Shall Escape My Sight. Let Those who worship Evil's might..... GREEN LANTERN'S LIGHT"
4,Not too shabby,"First off, I am glad that Bruce Timm & company decided to finally make a series about a DC super hero that is not Superman or Batman. This was a series I was excited for because it is the first DCAU series that is done in CGI. While the animation is a bit rough around the edges I am glad that the story was very rich in detail and character development. I also loved the fact that the story began with out an origin much like Batman and that the whole story revolved around the discovery of other Lantern Corps.I would have like to have seen other Green Lanterns rather than just having Hal & Kilowog in the first 13 episodes, but I am veryexcited for the second season and I feel it is going to be awesome with plenty more Lanterns to see."
3,"Warner Brothers, where is the Blu-Ray?","Yes, ""Green Lantern: The Animated Series"" is definitely family/kid friendly BUT there is plenty here for any GL fan to enjoy. What I'm definitely NOT enjoying is the fact that Warner Brothers is releasing season 1 on DVD only. The striking CGI animation looks only so-so in standard definition which is why I always watched it on Cartoon Network's HD channel, there the animation and colors literally popped off screen. They are missing a real opportunity by not releasing this on Blu-Ray.Warner Brothers, just because it's a cartoon doesn't mean adults don't watch it or that it's not worth releasing in HD (seriously, you guys broadcast it in HD, having to watch it on DVD is a major step DOWN) because adult GL fans like myself want to own the series in the best presentation possible and that's Blu-Ray. I sincerely hope you'll reconsider your decision."
1,corny,"since when does 130 pages constitute a novel? At best this is a poorly thought out short story expanded into a poorly written novella. Reading dreck like this, it is easy to understand why Green Bean Press is going out of business. The writing style is utterly substandard. The author should consider actually reading a book every once in a while. Perhaps then he will have a better understanding of his craft. Steer clear of this book as though it were an ugly brunette with kinker sore lined lips. Thank you. Good night"
3,Okay book,"I think the other reviewers, probably friends of the author, are being a little generous with their five stars. This book is okay at best. It has strong moments, but then there are moments that are highly unbelievable -- so much so that I was taken right out of the book, thinking, ""come on, Crocker, this needs rethinking."" It was published by a very small press. It would have never been published by a bigger one. I even think the representation of bipolar disorder is highly suspect in this book. On the back cover, people make allusions to Raymond Carver and Stephen King when discussing Crocker's writing. Again. Come on. This book has an interesting plot, but it's no great shakes as literature."
1,Pure Poop,"This is crap. You can't just sit down and poop out your little, and I mean ""little"", novel and think that people should want to read it. I'm so sick of MFA programs that produce people that think they can write because they have a degree. They'll work to have their poo poo published anywhere, and there are crappy little presses like Green Bean Press that will publish their work. Then they run around saying, ""I have a novel"" when all they really have is a bad case of gas. This isn't good writing. It's poop. Pure poop."
5,Worth taking a chance,"I took the chance on this band. Honestly, this is the first that I've heard of Limblifter. I wanted to get a ""new"" band for the collection... and take advantage of Amazon's Cloud Player (and additional free 15 GB of storage!!) So, I took the chance based on the previous reviews. Generally i'm a bit leery when it comes to trusting someone's review on Amazon, you never know when you're reading someone's own mother posting how great their kid is.Well, that may be the case with Limblifter, but I can tell you this, I know nothing of the band or even any of the members. I do know that I really enjoyed listening to the 'I/O' release. They have a different sound from the post-grunge rock band era. I can't compare it to much of what I've heard recently, and that's a good thing, as most bands today have the same sound. They are different, extremely talented and one of the best sounds that I've heard in a long time.Regards."
4,Pleasant,"I found this cd to be quite good. Ryan Dahle's style of music and love of melodic and soft beats really brings out emotion or the urge to get up dance when it's one of the ""rock-ier"" songs.Check it out if you're looking for something new and or Canadian."
3,Great album! But a CD-R and not a factory made CD,"I'm happy because I really wanted this album in my collection and after some years of waiting I can hear it again. 2 songs from this album played on a brazilian radio in the 70's...But, in other hand, I have to tell that it's a CD-R and not a factory made cd and it really made me a little unhappy."
3,Great boards but you can get them much cheaper in stores,"Love Wilton boards. They are sturdy and coated so they don't show grease, but in stores they are almost half the price. Shop around."
5,Love these too!,"Like their round boards these are great when taking a birthday cake to work . They are sturdy,attractive and inexpensive."
2,The Kenny Chesney CD to skip,"If you absolutely LOVE Kenny Chesney, pick this CD up. But if you just like many of his songs, don't get this one. The best word to describe this CD is ""DIFFERENT"". This is not the normal Chesney songs. It really does have a Buffet style to it. Even the song with the quickest tempo is slow (Guitars and Tiki Bars). It is the best song on the CD but I wouldn't have paid the full price for just this one song. I am very dissapointed in this CD. If I could trade it for another CD, I would do it in a heartbeat! Do yourself a favor and skip this CD. Try Pat Green's Lucky One's."
5,Chesney does it again,"Its not the same old Kenny Chesney album, but its the same old Kenny Chesney charm and voice! This man amazes me, and never fails to do so, I Love his country music, but I also love this, its was a riskey move but it was the right move, I love seeing a personal side. If he puts a little heart into it, the man could sing anything and I think we all would love it. I'v never been to the Islands, but I feel like I have after listening to this. Just about every song on the album is awesome, there are a few not as, but the ones that are make up for it. I do hope to see a more country type album from him soon, but this will do the trick until then!"
1,What happend Kenny ? I'm a big fan but this cd is bad.,"Get off the beach I think the ocean air has got to your brain and talk about boring.I've been to the ocean and been on a boat and it was alot more exciting than that. I would not pay $12 bucks for this junk. I know you love the ocaen and so do I. Get back to country, leave the ocean to jimmy he's old your not. You got plenty of time before you need to write slow bad beach songs when your ready to retire to the beach. You said"" Your fans are smart"" and if they are they will stay away from this one."
1,COME ON NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS AND IT WENT RIGHT IN THE GARBAGE!!!! THIS IS MUSIC WHEN YOUR ON A CRUISE SHIP BY YOURSELF!!! HE OBVIOUSLY IS RUNNING OUT OF MATERIAL, WHATS NEXT?? RAP??"
2,THANKS KENNY ??,"Of any Kenny Chesney album I have heard this one is by far the worst There are a couple decent tracks here but overall its best to stay away from this c.d I understand Kenny is a island boy and he loves to write and sing about his life there but a whole c.d of these tropical songs? gimme a break i thought this was supposed to be COUNTRY music the fans deserve better and so does kenny chesney i give it two stars only because im a big kenny chesney fan other than that, this album leaves a LOT to be desired"
1,I think all that sun has gone to his head.,"It happens all too often when a country singer becomes a big star. The record company gives them too much rope to record music they like that isn't country or just isn't good. I like all diff't styles of music -- country, rock, rap, pop, oldies, even some opera and (gasp) techno. I like it when Clay Walker does a song or two with a little island flare. If I wanted to hear an entire ablum of steel drums I'd buy, well...nothing, because I don't want to hear an entire album of island music. If you do, then consider this album.When I first bought the album, I listened to song after song waiting for Kenny to sing about something other than sand, sun or colorful drinks with umbrellas in them. It didn't happen. Luckily, I only paid $2 for the CD and I was able to sell it online the next day for about what I paid. Take my advice, if you're a big Kenny Chesney fan and you have to have this album to complete your collection, wait until the price drops to a penny."
3,"Huge Kenny Fan, But Sadly This CD is a No!","Let me first clarify that I'm a huge Kenny Chesney fan and when he comes to Dallas in May, I'll be there! I'm even a member of his fan club. Unfortunately, I can't give this album a great review like the others.I've read everything on this album and why he wanted to do it, but the ""Island"" thing is getting old. Kenny himself explains this as a departure, but only in that the majority of the songs are slow and boring. Not in the fact that he has to constantly stress that the ""Islands"" and ""water are a big part of his life.I hope in the future that Kenny will get away from the whole puka shell, sand, drinking, and island thing and show us what else he's about. Reinvent, be creative.If you want to hear a great island album with a nice mix of country, go with Jimmy Buffet. His latest album is by far, the best he's ever done. It's fabulous. One of my favorites."
1,"I Miss the ""Country"" Singer Kenny Chesney....","I know he's spent all this time in the islands, but come on. This isn't the Kenny Chesney we all fell in love with. These songs are songs no one can relate to except Kenny. The reason he became who he is, is because people could relate to his songs. Not on this album. He has drifted away from his bread and butter to become a novelty. Every song has a ""tropical"" feel, not a ""country"" feel. If you want music to play at a Luau, then this is for you. If your a country kid looking for music to play while driving down an old dirt road, stick in one of his old cds. I'm still a huge fan, just not of this particular album."
5,happy anniversary,got this for my husband on our 5th wedding anniversary. he wore out his old copy. he listens to it all the time. good purchase.
2,WAKE UP KENNY!?!,"This album should have been quarantined for sale only in the island. And the target group would be only tourists heading for a paradise island. Come on, Kenny! Wake up and return to the real world! Where are the great stuff like 'Fall In Love', 'Grandpa Told Me So' or even love ballads like 'Me and You' or 'You Had Me From Hello'. I'm sure a lot of your fans would think it's too much of an island songs. We need decent, solid country songs with thought provoking lyrics. We are not tourists cruising on a boat, drinking and sun bathing. Hopefully, you're not gonna run naked on the beach for the shooting of the next album's cover, ARE YOU?"
3,The Star is rising.,"Why? Because I know one thing...there is ""Old Blue Chair"" in future. Am I Nostradamus or what?"
4,Not As Good as His Recent Efforts,"I like Kenny a lot, especially in an ever weakening country music arena, but this album just wasn't his best. After riding the wave of success that was ""No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem"" and ""When the Sun Goes Down,"" I was expecting more of the same. It was not in this album. If you are looking to add Kenny to your collection I would look to some of his prior albums first and patiently await his new album in the hopes that it will be a return to greatness. This album is good, don't get me wrong, I've just come to expect more from Kenny."
1,Put Down the Beer,"I got into country music because of Kenny Chesney... I liked the stories he told in his songs and they were funt o listen too... I don't know what happened, but the stories about life he told before were about real things things that could happen to people... About Love, Life, and Family... This CD's songs about life are typical of a life long Spring Break... It's all about drinking... Having a drink in this hand, a drink in that hand... Palm trees... Drinking, drinking, drinking... It's almost as if Chesney joined a Fraternity... His old songs were better... He needs to stop hanging out with that I Can't Write a Song of My Own Uncle Kracker and realize that one Jimmy Buffett is enough..."
5,Love Something Sexy About The Rain,I think this album is wonderful! I don't feel he is trying to be anyone else than Kenny Chesney. I think it is nice that he wants to share his intimate thoughts about life with his fans. I applaud him for taking a risk on this album.My favorite song is Something Sexy About The Rain. Also Key Lime Pie is quite the catchy tune.This cd should definately be in your collection!
4,Definitely worth listening to,"First off, Kenny is not trying to be anyone else but himself. The CD is a compliation of songs he has written over the past 5 years or so with no intention of ever recording them on CD. If some of you think he is trying to be Jimmy Buffett, then so be it.No, this CD is not like anything he has done before and it is a departure from the Kenny music that everyone is familiar with. So what? It's a CD that is easy to listen to and if you listen closely to the words of some of the songs, you may get some insight into Kenny. That's what this CD was meant to be...moments of his life put into songs and shared with his fans. My favorites are ""Boston"", ""Somewhere in the Sun"" and ""Old Blue Chair"". If you have listened once and didn't like it, try listening again. You may surprise yourself."
1,Huge disappointed.,Very sad to listen and be extremely disappointed. All it was was him singing about being in paradise. BORING!
5,Kenny shows wide range of artistic talent,Loved this CD- listening to Island songs in northern Indiana in the dead of winter (outside temp -2) made this CD an extremely enjoyable experience. Kenny has really shown his wide range of artistic ability as a singer/song writer. Worth the wait and suspense!
2,BORING.....,"If you are a country music fan..this isn't the CD for you. Come on Kenny, we are tired of your island music. What happened to songs like she thinks my tractor's sexy? Big Star?"
2,Save your money,"Wow, what a let down. I already gave this cd a new home in the trash can. I understand what he's doing and all but come on ! I thought I got the wrong version at first, maybe I accidentally bought the Islands tourist version. If one or two or three songs were about the beach bum lifestyle and such, that would have been good with me but all of them !? damn you Kenny."
3,Easy Listening...Not Country,"I have all of his previous CD's and have seen him in concert. This is a nice CD...very easy to listen to...but it is not the ""She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"" Kenny Chesney. I am an avid country music fan...and this has went from contemporary country to the...well, I don't know what you would call it, category.Don't get me wrong, it is nice island music. Very laid back and easy on the ears. However, it is NOT country.If you love him, buy it. If you like island music (you know, with the stell drums and all), buy it. If you are looking for some good country music...pass. You'll be as disappointed as I am. I think he's been thinking about the Carribean too long....."
4,Captures my vacation,"I recently returned from ten days on a sailboat in the British Virgin Islands. On my last day we went to Foxy's on Jost Van Dyke and this music was playing. It completely captures the serenity, beauty and peacefulness of the islands. I am not a real country fan but this album has some good songs (albeit not perfect) and takes me back (as good music does) to good times."
5,Island Boy,"This isn't your typical counrty music but it still great stuff. If you like to relax and get away listen to this Album. Grab a drink, light some candles and relax. You'll be trasported to the islands listening to this Album. After listening to all the song I plan a vacation to the islands. If the islands are as Kenny describes I should be having the time of my life."
5,A Piece of Himself,"I loved this C.D.!! True Kenny fans will take his words to heart when in the introduction he said he made the album so he could share this special part of his life....a part of who he is....with his friends, family and fans. I am truly happy that Kenny Chesney has found his paradise. He is a gifted song writer and should definately record more of his own songs....mostly country music of course. : )"
4,"Good music, but still disappointed","While I enjoyed most of the songs on Kenny's new CD, there is part of me that is somewhat disappointed..it's like he's letting us all know he's got the greatest life, spends time slumming on his boat and hanging out with booze and chics (sort of a slam in the face) whenever he's not on the road...um - hello - time to grow up -you are 36-37 now!! His music is getting more and more like Jimmy Buffett by the day and while I love Buffett, I also miss the good 'ol Kenny Chesney country songs (especially the love songs)."
4,It's good,"This album is good and yes a lot of the themes are similar but there is nothing wrong with that. I enjoy the songs but I don't think Kenny is the best songwriter in Nashville and didn't expect this album to be full of legendary prose. Take it for what it is, a reflection album and a non-commerical album. At least Kenny didn't use a computer program that a lot of people in Nashville use to write lyrics. These are just his thoughts while he is on his boat relaxing and so it makes it that much better. It's not supposed to be a country album or his best album. This is an artist who has written these songs over a number of years and finally decided to record them because that is what he is feeling at the moment. Each album from No Shoes is sort of a documentary of where he is in his life and Kenny admits the samething. He is both a country boy and an island boy. This is a reflection of his island life and thank you Kenny for taking a chance on this album!"
1,Disappointed,Ok first off I love music from country to heavy metal. I own 800 or so cds and hundreds of records as well. I really like KC but he is no songwriter. He should of stuck with letting others write his songs. I can understand as an artist he wants to branch out and he has earned the right to do that but not with my money. I'm glad I heard this cds before I bought it. I could of stood the Island theme but the songs just are not very good. French kissing life! Key Lime pie! Please spare us. This cd is slow and boring. I only hope he does not play many of these songs on tour since I already have tickets. I'll be waiting for a new cd from him to see if he gains his senses next time. Sorry KC your no Jimmy Buffet. Even Jimmy had to switch to country to actually reach a large audience. Just consider this review a warning folks. KC can do what he wants but I would save my money for a better cd in the future if I was you.
2,Kenny Chesney,I have to be totally honest about this cd even as I state that I have been a fan for many years and I own most of his cds. This is not his best work. Alot of the songs on this new cd are weak compared to his other cds. Not to many hit songs on this one. I have to wonder if he didn't just rush through this recording to have a new cd out to tour on? Artist need to remember that the music will be what stands the test of time not the touring which makes them all the money.
4,different but good,"Kenny really likes the islands, no joke. If you are looking for something like ""she thinks my tractor's sexy"", then don't waste your time. This cd is strictly island beach bum material, which isn't a bad thing. There are some strong songs on here, and Kenny sounds as honest as ever. Overall this one plays a little long, partly due to the fact that the same ideas are recycled over the course of the cd. Still an enjoyale listen."
5,Takes You To The Islands!!,"I absolutely love this cd! I can listen straight through and then all over again. Even though it's not as country as Kenny's other albums i think it is great. You can really tell that most of his songs are about escaping, and his experiences in the islands. This cd is mellow, happy and all around wonderful! Thanks Kenny!"
2,a forecaster's opinion (who is also an economist),"Mr. Ellis really put a lot of work into this book. He coversabout 40 years of data analysis and he contributes some valuableinsights such as 1. Consumer spending drives the economy 2. useyear to year quarters and not previous quarters for comparison3. employment is a lagging indicator 4. Consumer spending alsodrives the stock market.5. The importance of average hourlywages in driving consumer spending.I do have some problems with his book. First of all, he doesnot offer a forecast he offers a model of how the economy is driven. How good would he have forecasted the economy given his mode? another problem I have is that he does not compare hismodel with other models. Did Dri/Chase use his variables andmethodology? if not why not? I am not convinced that he can forcast or his model can any better than what was previouslyused. I do have a number of other problems but as an applicationsoriented practioner I will do delve into theoretical issues."
4,Excellent Book on Consumer Retail Economics,"Very will written book on consumer retail economics.. I would recommend it if you are looking to forecast consumer behavior, as a PM or retail business owner"
5,Truth is stranger than Fiction!,This book reveals that which is not known by many & for good reason otherwise for those of us who keep their mind clear & are not narrow minded & stuck in their differences regarding religions & sects would have lost the chance to read this superb saga where the secrets of within are told so clearly.I would recommend this book to all spiritual seekers not religious but spiritual seekers cause it really clears up lot of doubts & helps in understanding the path.Enjoy this book & may all find the way back home within.
1,Title of the book deceiving....,"I found the title of this book deceiving. I was expecting to see Kabir's ""dohas"" (sayings) and their meaning which was missing. What I did find was a lot of criticism of hinduism amd islam. Very disappointed..........waste of money!"
1,Jack Bauer In Print,"I read with great interest some of the reviews and descriptions of this series of books and truly looked forward to an entertaining novel in The Peacock Angel. What I received instead was a Jack Bauer-esque version of what the author imagines the world of espionage and intrigue to be. The clipped, macho, and totally cliche dialouge is distracting at best, and totally annoying at its worst. The characters are similarly shallow, cliche, and are cut from a fastfood, Jack Bauer 24-type mold, one which is designed for readers who have no imagination or appreciation for the subtlety of intelligence work. When placed next to say John LeCarre, Alan Furst, or Eric Ambler, this book shrinks to dust and blows away with the first breeze. In short, if you like cliche, shallow stories, by all means read away......"
2,Disappointing,"The book falls short speciallly because of the foreword by Syd Field. The author just kept repeating the the same imformation throughout the whole book. On each chapter he tells about the different ideas he came up with, but there is a lack of information on how to get started, and resources that could guide you even further. There isn't even a bibliography of websites and other books. Beyond the idea, you won't know where to go, or how to make it roll. I think that these days a book should include resources specially from the internet since we are living in a digital era."
5,"Fun and no work, equals no food",I think that this book was very good. I really enjoyed reading it. i think it will show kids that they have responsibilities that the have to live by and that they must follow it.
4,Good story and lessons to be learned.,"While my son is not too fond of this story, I think this story has some good lessons to be learned."
5,"Promises little, does it all","Robert J McMahon-The Cold War: A Very Short Introduction (OUP, 2003)My last review was of John Prados-How the Cold War Ended: Debating and Doing History, entered under obus7 Promises too much, concluded: ""Promises a lot, lets expect much. Does not deliver - still sounds like a few random events with a few decided whistle-blowers.""A much shorter opus does it in a bit over half a page, much shorter, but also much clearer. The key sentence is: By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, the Cold War was already history.So the end dates read: 1989 German reunification, 1990 sovereign re-unified Germany in NATO under four Allied Powers treaty, 1991 Soviet collapse. A lot of action in a short time, but understanding the sequence is vital.obus8 - Robert J McMahon-The Cold War: A Very Short Introduction (OUP, 2003) - 20/9/2012"
3,Mediocre,"The hold is good enough, and the color is both pleasant and not terribly unnatural looking. It is easy to mold and maintain. Until you walk about in the cold. The condensation from my breath is enough to turn the otherwise firm holding wax into a black, dripping, soupy mess. While a tissue quickly remedies this, it is rather disheartening to have a morning;s preparation undone by naught but one's own breath. I cannot say if I had it to do again, I would bother with this wax.That said, the styling brush is rather good, The comb is of sufficient depth to reach the underlying skin, but not so long as to be cumbersome, with fine enough tines to sort out unruly facial hair quickly. The brush is notably less useful, though still sufficient to probably handle finer facial hair than my own."
2,Dows the job.. but not without a bit of work,"The was does what it says it will; it helps shape and style facial hair.The only issues I had:The compound is very thick and difficult to manage; I have to jab the end of the provided sharp comb inside to pull out a glob for use.. application is difficult when your starting point is a small chunk the consistency of soft wax. Also the cap broke the first time it was tightened, so the tube is no longer airtight.Perhaps mine dried out, accounting for the thickness not everyone else has experienced.Recommended with a caution; be careful not to over tighten the cap."
2,Mediocre,"I got my package on time and in aparently good conditions, but the hands-free device came defective. From the very first time I noticed you have to keep shaking it around to make it work; which made me lose a couple of calls; I could not hear a thing through it, so I'm lacking the ability to drive and answer incoming calls at the same time. This is critical for me since I get work orders through my cellular."
1,poor,"the case is too small to fit the cell phone.the botton of the headset dosen't work, the sound is bad too."
4,Excellent personal or group study,This is an excellant book on organizing your life God's way! I would highly recommend purchasing the study guide that goes along with it- you are missing out on half of the application/scripture and ideas if you don't! I look forward to seeing it as a Sunday School class or bible study in our church soon. It really prioritizes things and bases all on scripture- I did not find it biased at all- once again you really need the study guide to get the most out of it- it is filled with scripture and application and is all biblical- I highly recommend it and can't wait to do the next chapter each day!
2,Not well thought out for beginners,"I just bought The Wave, and viewed Ride the Wave and the express workout and I don't understand why they didn't make the beginner workouts longer and *slower* and use instructors who were better suited to instructing beginners. The workouts were only ten minutes long. A true beginner needs a longer slower workout to build up strength so they can progress the intermediate workouts. And, instead of using instructors who would explain the moves well and move at a suitable pace, several very young instructors who move very fast were used ( which could make it unsafe for beginners.) Why? I like the Wave but the beginner workouts need some work to be safe and effective."
2,Not for the uncoordinated!!!,"I was really excited when I saw this equipment. I never saw the infomercial before purchasing. I bought it at a retail outlet and thought it looked like a lot of fun.I've been working out at home for over the past year and have gained a lot of strength. But my problem with this workout system is that the DVD's and the instructors just went way too fast to pick up on the routines. There is no slow demonstration of the moves to learn them before they just dive into the workout. I will admit that I have never been the most coordinated person, but it was so frustrating that I just gave up.The instructors need to learn to slow down and show the moves!!!!"
5,"Fun, Light Workout!","I hate exercise and have never bought exercise equipment from infomercials, but this looked like it might be fun and help tone up my body after having a baby three months ago. I think the wave is great. I've only had it two days and I am already feeling and seeing results. My goal is to loose 15 lbs, and I think this is really going to help. I do have to agree with the other reviews, that the dvd's are pretty lame, but if you just jump on it and make up your own moves it is fun. I do it when I'm watching t.v. and also rock on it while I'm holding my baby and she loves it. My three year old also thinks it's fun, so it doubles as a toy for him too!"
3,Okay for those with born with coordination,"This system would be great for those who are quick to pick up movements...not for those of us who are challenged with coordination. The first disk is easy enough, but the second I have tried five times and cannot keep up (there is no build up to this level). So, I become discouraged after my work out with the second disc simply because I am not improving.... to gain full benefit from this you must use both workouts."
3,super fast,"I bought this product because I seen this on an infomercial, good price and free shipping! Wow, but when it arrived, I decided to pull it out of the box and try it.It was nice that it came with cds but oh my gosh, goes way to FAST! I pick up on things pretty easy, but not with this too fast and you can't keep up. I didn't see that on the commercials. If I could do it over again I would not buy the product waste of money."
2,"The ""Wave"" A Bit of a Disappointment","I saw the wave in the store and thought this looked like something I would like. I was disappointed to find that it was alot like my step exerciser that I had put away. I got my step back out and compared and it turned out my step gave me a better work-out. The video actually made up my mind for returning the wave. The instructors moved so fast that I was still turning the wave to the right position and they had already started on the exercise (and I'm not that slow). Since I was new to this ""wave"" I wanted to follow the slower instructor and she was way to the side and the camera didn't show her until the exercise had been going and by then I was all messed up. I felt she should have been more in the center where you could see her as well as the more advanced instrutor. Like I said, I took the ""wave"" back and am now back with my step. With the ""wave"" I didn't feel anything and with my step, I know and feel that I got a good workout..Hope this helped.."
1,Disappointed,"Call it a miss-judgement but if you don't have good balance, even after 3 weeks of using this it left our family less than interested in continuing its use."
5,firm,I exercise daily and I sure like the change with thw work out using the wave. It gives me different challeanges.
5,Wow,This product is amazing it came bfore the date I was told and the price was chapper thant the official web site I am very pleased.
3,Love the Speed Slimming Sculpt Hate the Rock It off express!!,"The speed slimming video was really easy to follow. I did it for the first time yesterday and I woke up with my butt/thighs/abs sore. I could really feel the burn! Which is awesome b/c those areas are my target areas.The Rock It off express was VERY hard to follow. There is no instruction of the moves before she does them which makes it VERY hard to follow.I'll keep it, b/c I'm going to give it 2 weeks to see if by then I can follow her much easier. If not, I think I'll return it. Which is sad b/c I absolutely love the other video!!I gave it a 3 b/c that was a 50/50 score in my book."
3,"Cheap plastic and creaky, wobbly","I bought THE WAVE by The Firm today at Wal-Mart. After watching the first video, I tried the exercises. I've exercised using step aerobics, etc., before and found a step aerobic bench much more effective than this. THE WAVE is an overpriced piece of plastic that is ultimately creaky, wobbly and unstable. You have to use this thin mat under it as it will move around all over the place if you don't. I am returning it as it does not even seem safe. I can't believe they have the nerve to charge $57 for this product. One other caution: if you have balance problems, this is absolutely not for you."
3,Mixed feelings,"I love the concept of this system, but didn't quite get into it. I pre - ordered this when it first came out. I used it for a few weeks and stuck it in the attic for a few years. I have recently taken out to test out my new heart rate monitor and see how many calories I actually burn using this. Rock it Off was the best, burning 455 calories for me in about 40 minutes, but that is really the only workout from this series that I enjoyed. The wave could be replaced w/ a step bench for the most part."
3,Okay...but no Jillian Micheals,"The firm wave workout was OK...but I was not sore afterwards like I am with a Jillian Michaels workout. In addition, the old firm workout with the two boxes stacked on top of each other were better to me. Not saying that you won't get a workout with this b/c you will. But I am not sure if the results would be the same as with the old firm workout or with Jillian. Good deal though if you are looking to purchase this!"
2,All about butt and thighs... very little upper body exercise,"I was really disappointed in this workout system. The main focus is butt and thighs and hardly any of the video is dedicated to core or upper body. I don't think this is a very well rounded workout. Also, the wave board is frustrating. I was constantly have to put the board back on the mat as it does not stay in place. I will stick to Core Secrets."
3,It's okay for days when I'm not at my best...,"I got this product because I am a huge FIRM believer, and this was fun for a little while, but if you're used to doing really hard exercise (like the original FIRMs that were taped in the dance studios), this will begin to bore you very quickly. It got to where I wasn't even breaking a really good sweat with the Wave. Yes, the instability of the Wave makes you work your legs a little more, but it's definitely not what I would call strenuous. If you're just starting out, are sick, or are getting back into the swing of things, this would be great. But if you're in shape and are used to doing some rough exercises, I would personally skip it. I may break this out the next time I have the flu or a cold and still want to exercise..."
5,Fun Workout!,I have many of The Firm workouts and this one is lots of fun! It takes a little bit to get your balance but once you do you can really get a good workout.
2,fun but not revolutionary.,"I was hoping to feel some big difference in my body by doing this workout, but unfortunatly did not. If you are new to the firm or excersise this may be the ticket for you, it does have alot of fun moves and it is short enough to keep you coming back. As a firm believer it comes nowhere near the level of intensity of the transfirmer box, or the more recent DVD's with their high energy cardio I love. The claims about engaging your core on the wave may be true but I personally did not see any big difference.Please don't take this the wrong way because i love the firm just not this new system."
4,The Wave,"I have enjoyed the product. It's a great workout. I have used workouts by The Firm over the last ten years. They are challenging but well worth the effort. The only thing that I didn't like had nothing to do with the product itself. I chose to use the free shipping option, which is great if you want to wait about two weeks to receive your order."
2,sucks for seniors,I ordered this because of their wonderful infomercial. The workouts go so fast and are so hard to follow that I am completely lost. I would not reccommend this for any one over 50. You are not fast or flexible enough if you are a normal person. I have nbeen wakling two miles a day and am very active. Cannot keep up with this DVD program.
5,excelent item,"I think that this item is excelent in all its characteristics: price, delivery, directions, and health help. I recommend it 100% to everybody."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED!,"The cardio segments move too fast without ever reviewing the moves ahead of time. I struggled to figure out what the moves were, and fell so far behind, that I just gave up. The slower moves with weights were pretty easy to follow, but I had to sit out during each cardio interval, so.... that kind of defeats the purpose.I would never recommend this to anyone. If you are a quick study with fast moves, you might like this - everyone else will just be disappointed and frustrated!"
1,"frankly, I don't give a ****","Although I have loved the real Firm, to me this was the ultimate gimmick, sheer garbage and a total waste of money. I see they are no longer advertising it, so apparently it did not catch on. Surprise,surprise! The rocking motion felt very unsafe, unnatural and non-aerobic. Unsafe at any speed."
1,not pleased,I bought the product NEW but when it arrived it was used dvds wouldn't play piece missing and there was cat hair in the dvds when opened and I have to pay to have it shipped back. So I really didn't get the chance to try the product. Not pleased with the product or Amazon.
1,The Wave,"I was very disappointed in my latest purchase. It came wtih DVDs that freeze up, then get all blurry, and then skip to a different section. It is very difficult to follow an exercise program like this. I have ordered many things from Amazon so I trusted that I would have no troubles with my purchase. I am very disappointed."
3,gift,I bought this as a gift. It arrived when promised. It appears to be everything that they wanted
5,Butterfly lamp,"Great little lamp for our daughter's room. It has lots of colors, which makes it versatile if we ever paint her room a different color. It seems to be quite well-made. The shade looks as if it is hand-painted, which gives it more personality and charm than other lamps. It's perfect size for a desk or bedside table. Fast shipping and good packaging from the vendor. Would highly recommend."
2,Stash this tea in the back of the cupboard,"First time trying the Stash brand. Lured into it with the good deal from Amazon. The verdict: eh.I chose this Exotica assortment as the description of the 9 teas included sounded high-end; I thought that this would be a level above regular tea bags with such exotic sounding names as Silver and Golden and Champagne. Sadly, upon opening the individual foil seals, you find paper tea bags with tea dust(CDC) as fine as Lipton, much less full-leaf. Once brewed, the flavors are weak and lifeless. I've tried at least 6 of the 'flavors' and they are practically indistinguishable from each other, despite names that indicate specific geographic and quality provenance.Disappointed, and I will not be buying this brand again."
4,Stash Exotica Tea Sampler,What a delightful taste of teas!! I enjoy taking the foil wrapped tea bags to a restaurant and having an exotic flavor with my meal. The waitresses and other patrons will usually stop by our table and ask what kind of tea I am drinking. The aroma is so tantalizing and wonderful. I have shared several of the flavors with my family and friends. Everyone has his/her own favorite.
4,You don't have to be military to read this,"The main focus of this book is to inform the reader of how U.S. military strategy has remained unchanged in ""the new face of war."" Old military strategy, new different type of war. Can be broken down into two interrelated parts: 1) U.S. military strategy is based on the assumption that there will be foreign ports available from which military operations can be deployed (mainly in Saudi Arabia). 2) New threats to the U.S. and deployed U.S. military personnel have developed (Chemical, Biological, Nuclear, and Radiological weapons). The two are discussed separately and together (how those new weapons can be used to effectively disrupt/delay deployment of troops through their use on Saudi ports used for deployment).Robert Chandler does a good job of convincing the reader that the threats he discusses are both real and credible. Highly recommended by someone with no military background."
1,didnt like it,"i have been practicing yoga for two yrs, all kinds. either this dvd or koundalini does not do it for me. i dont feel the workout"
3,Okay for what it is - but damn full of glitches,"I bought my gold iPod mini about a year ago, and was immediately unhappy with a few things: of the 4 GB of memory, only about 3.5 are available, the ""12 hour battery"" only lasted for about 4, and the earbud headphones didn't work right (they would spurt static randomly during songs). But I figured these were minor things and proceeded to fill it up with music. And I must say it's performed relatively well, except that it tends to ""forget"" things, like the length of a song, and reassign a shorter length that cuts off the song somewhere in the middle. It's also been experiencing frequent hard drive crashes, where I've had to restore it to factory settings and upload all my music again.Overall, I'm happy with it. It's just those little glitches (and Apple's refusal to reimburse me for them) that piss me off."
5,Super fast in my G5,"Added this drive as a second unit in my Power Mac G5. Installation was a snap, about 10 mins. Booted up and formatted it with Mac OS Extended Journaled in a minute or two.Initially I have loaded all my Application Programs and what I call ""Work in Progress"" (client jobs).I quickly saw how much faster programs ran, especially web browsing. Open and saves were faster too, with Photoshop, Quark and Illustrator.There is some slight drive noise (clicking) when it is accessing apps and docs, but not enough to loose a star!."
2,I should have read reviews first...,I ordered this doll for my 18 month old daughter that always has a pacifier in her mouth. I wanted the picture...I got an ugly outfit and no pacifier!! Too late for exchanges before Christmas! I expected more from Amazon and Toysrus!! I will not make this mistake again!
4,"Pretty good, considering","Actually I think some of the criticisms are overdone. Of course it is nearly impossible to cover such a country as Mexico. Ideally, you need a book per region.I have the 1998 version and it has served me very well for four visits (1999, 2001, 2003, 2004).The country will always evolve (especially somewhere such as Chiapas - the mid 1990s LPs would have said don't go, there's a war on! I went in 2003.)And because of us the prices will rise, and you will find ever more Americans (yes gringos, it's a terrible shame to see so many of you - but I salute your taste in this regard.....)My book is pretty dog-eared - but I always take it."
4,There's a vintage version,"All I will say is that there is a vintage version of the Magna Guard atStar Wars 2010 Vintage Collection Action Figure Magna Guard. It's an incredible figure and should easily replace this version as the definitive version. This one isn't bad, but its plastic cape and largely lackluster color tones just pale in comparison to its newer cousin."
1,I don't understand,"I read the book, and I don't understand it. According to this gal, she talks to an alien friend. Well, I also am familiar with other groups that say the same things, and they are known as cult groups. So, how are we supposed to believe this? I read it for free online, but still, I don't know. There were no real pictures, no documents from physicians, so basically just this gal, saying that this is real. I feel bad for anyone that believes it, since there isn't any proof.There could always be some type of proof, however small that would be, but I find this just to be a knock off, from what the other groups say, that are disregarded.She takes real UFO phenomenom, and twists it into something that completely makes all UFO researchers have to work harder, so that we are not losing ground. (With real physical fact) To each his own, but I will stick to what is tangible.Jimmy, WA"
1,Just another hack trying to jump on the UFO and Shadow People Craze,"Sigh. When I first heard of this book, I was somewhat interested and I wanted to find out more about the author and the story she was telling. Well, I read the book and shook my head. Unfortunately, this is just another UFO nut who claims to have spoken with an alien -- a story that we've heard so many times before. It covers familiar territory in the UFO field, but tries to borrow from the Bible to refresh the plot.Most of us call these authors UFO nuts, but this time we can add False Prophet to the description as well.UFOs + Shadow People + random Bible snippets = WRONG!!!Don't waste your time folks. It's just another cult book."
3,Interesting but disappointing,"Heid's writing style reminds me of a hand written note to a close friend. Rambling and sometimes not all that clear. She does have some interesting stuff to say, you just have to put the style aside. Do I subscribe to everything said? I don't know yet, more research is necessary. I am glad I bought the book, and I am considering others by her."
2,Heidi's request for a review,"Hi, Heidi, you wanted some people to give an honest review of your book. It was ok I am going to do this anonomously because I don't want you or other board memebers to get mad at me. I liked the book, but it just wasn't what I though it would be. you had been telling us for a long time to expect it, and I ordered it when it became available, but it was just not what I expected. It was long and it bored me alittle, but please don't be mad, I don't want you to ban me or get mad, I like you alot, it is just that I thought more important stuff would be in it. I am sorry but you ansked for honesty."
2,Interesting,"The book was interesting, it is always fascinating to read true stories of close encounters and paranormal phenomena. The book was mostly about how the author met an alien being. The material from the alien was very vague, and basically mimicking other known new age concepts. There was a biblical catch to the book, similar to that in ""Come Sail Away"". Throughout the story of aliens was a message of ""turn to God"". It is fascinating to see religion and paranormal combined in such a manner, but it lacked any backup data as used by Whitley Strieber and others to help substantiate the claims."
1,Ufo stories,"I actually thought that this was going to be about UFO's, but I found that it was more about religion, and someones' personal religious beliefs. I don't get it. I didn't go away feeling that I had anything new to believe in. Just more of someone's personal saga, that at best is hard to believe. I felt like this was a cult type of book, and even though it has peaceful intentions upfront, all the talk of the end of the world stuff actually made me feel terrible. What the world definately doesn't need now is bogus information and hype that doesn't do anything but instill fear in unsuspecting readers. I thought it was terrible. I could kick myself for buying it. Not a good buy. The picture on the cover was nice though. That seemed more real that the words inside."
1,"Interesting Topic, poorly communicated","I was really looking forward to reading this book. I might have found it interesting had it not been so poorly written. Where were the editors?!?!?! There were so many grammatical errors--run-on sentences, comma splices, sentence fragments, misspelled words, misuse of commas and apostrophes, prepositions at the ends of sentences--and these errors were distracting. This book is a rough draft written by an amateur, albeit one who has studied and perhaps understands the phenomenon about which she writes. Unfortunately, the ideas were so poorly communicated, I disliked the book."
2,"Good for a laugh, I guess","Phew! This one is rough-going. Some people seem to be able to overlook the 'Lost in Space' laughability of the costumes, but I can't. There would be many more cheesy costumes in years to come but these are the worst. Although he was the originator of the character Hartnell would never be as effective again as he was in his first few stories. His ever-increasing cackling and clucking to cover the fumbling of his lines is often painful to watch. This may be Doctor Who sacrilege but I almost prefer the performance of Richard Hurndall as the first Doctor in 'The Five Doctors' since his lines are delivered crisply and you get more of a sense of a formidable intellect than you often got from Hartnell. If you want Hartnell Who at its best go all the way back to An Unearthly Child and The Daleks (Doctor Who - The Beginning Collection)."
1,Never got to watch,I never got to watch this DVD because it was sent damaged and come to think of it I never got a refund for it either.
5,Laugh out loud funny,"Hilarious, and very feel good. The caricatures of various Indian ethnicities are spot on, and yet you always know the filmmaker's heart is in the right place.If you are Indian, you will love this.If you know Indians, you may love this, and you'll definitely understand just a little better where your Indian friends are coming from.If you are not Indian and don't know any Indians ... where the hell do you live, without engineers, doctors, motels?!"
1,Lions of punjab,"Someone told me it was very funny, I did not enjoy this movie at all. Very boring, total waste of money"
2,Old,"The game is a typical real time strategy/tactics. It combines elements from familiar Microprose games (e.g. Masters of Magic) with real time components. The major drawback of the game is that there's really not much to do - the game kind of plays itself. You only contribute by building buildings and telling them to produce units. The mechanism for controlling the units is kind of awkward, even if somewhat different than other games. You set a price on a territory to explore or a bad guy to kill and the units respond based on their character. There's no way to give specific commands to units. The game gets old really fast, the variations in strategy from one scenario to the next are negligible. It's interesting at first but gets boring very quickly. In addition the scenarios are kind of easy. I gave it up after the first two hours. I think you can find tons of better RT strategy games. I am a huge fan of the Microprose titles and this was a big time dissapointment."
2,This game [stinks],"This game [stinks]. ... Buy it if you want to occupy yourself for 1-2 days. It's basically doing the same thing over, trying to achieve new goals that each mission sets. Not much of an RPG, juz plain strategy with a medival theme."
1,Absolutley HORRIBLE!,"Needless to say if you look on the back of the box it states from ages 9 and up. It has pretty much the same quests, and gets quite boring after 2 or three scenarios. Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed. I took mine back after 1 day. Hope this helps...."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I put 1 star because there wasn't a spot for negative 1. if you think you want a game like this try anything else... Age of Empires, CaesarIII, Civilization, Comand and Conquer Just DON'T waste your money on this boring stupid game. Thank you, I hope my advise sways you descision."
5,Majesty Rocks!!!,"Very fun and exiting. Provides hours of entertainment! It kept my brother, cousins, and I occupied for the whole summer! It lets you controll you palace and medieval city, and lets you create Knights, Rouges, and other magical people! Conquer your enemy, or whatever feat you must occomplish, and reap your victory!"
3,"Not bad, but definitely not great","The game is fun, much like Dungeon Keeper in game play and feel, but the graphics and UI are primitive, typical of games from 4-5 years ago. The zoom only allows two zoom levels, one incredibly close and one a little too far away. There's no way to adjust the speed of the game; you have to use the default speed that's sometimes a little too slow and sometimes a little too fast. And the gameplay becomes repetative pretty quickly. The comparison with The Sims is ridiculous. This game has none of the complicated behaviors and AI in The Sims.It's a fun game, but not the breakthrough product. Dungeon Keeper II or Age of Empires II might be a better choice."
4,"Fun, but hope they make a meaningful upgrade","I gotta admit, I have dumped hundreds of hours into this game.It has alot of good fantasy ideas built into it. It isn't buggy. It is fun. It seems hard to beat.But once you figure out the deal, it isn't so much fun and you wish they would have invested more effort into the AI and play balance.The drill to play this game is like so many other games these days: Hunker down and survive the first rush of monsters (the harder the settings the more ridiculously impossible this becomes). Then if you can survive the big rush, the rest of the game is super simple, easy and eventually boring. It is always the same. The AI never mixes it up.This game is better than most, but nowhere near as good as it could be."
3,Not too impressive,"This game is pretty fun if you like being slautered and having very little control over it. Imagine this: you're having a nice little time building your little kingdom when all of the sudden 3 huge minatours come and start hacking away at all you have worked so hard for. You want them killed so you put a reward on their heads, but all of your hero dudes are off chasing giant rats and stuff. In the mean time your pathetically wimpy city gaurds are getting slautered. Well I think you get the picture. I personally had fun until I got hacked to death with nothing to do about it."
3,Good but not Great,"I wouldn't really classify this game as a RTS. Place the buildings, set some rewards, and your troops just do their thing. It's an entertaining game but not involved enough for my liking."
5,Sea Monkey T-Shirt,"It came in a bright color, with the original characters. The design hasn't washed off and it was in a generous size with good fbric. A must for anyone who wants an unusual t shirt!"
1,This Truck isn't built to play with only display in a glass case,This product didn't meet our expectations and I wish we didn't purchase it. It broke within minutes after our grandchild started playing with it.
2,Better left at the library,"This book provides some interesting background information about the countries, but was not organized very well to serve as a reference on-the-fly. While you may be interested in reading about Latvian daina song-poems from your living room before leaving on your trip, you'll find yourself cursing all that information when you're just trying to find some specific tip on bus routes to the ethnographic museum. If your itinerary is going to focus mainly on the capital cities, as mine did, I would highly recommend the book Bradt Baltic Capitals. It was infinitely more useful than the Rough Guide, cheaper, and half the size and weight."
5,Aero Brake Levers,Comfortable grips. Used these to replace some mid-70s vintage hooded brake levers. They clamp tight to the bars and don't slip or twist.
3,"Intriguing, yet Frustrating","Those who enjoy this genre will probably have much less trouble playing this game than I did. I am a complete novice at this type of game(similar to games like Myst), and was about as frustrated as one could possibly be without actually resorting to physical violence against the computer. I finally broke down and downloaded the ""helpful hints"" from a sight on the internet...which made ALL the difference! In general, I would say that the graphics, the design of the game,etc. were beyond excellent...unbelievably good, actually. The frustration comes in knowing that you have obviously missed something (because the computer kills you off), but having no idea just how far back you need to go (when so many of the events are very precisely timed)in order to try to figure out what you've missed. For those who normally enjoy playing this type of game, it would probably grab all 5 stars and maybe more; for me, the frustration factor was just a little too high."
4,I NEED HELP,I AM NOT CLEVER ENOUGH TO KEEP MYSELF FROM BEING KILLED IN TYLER WHITES COMPARTMENT. NO MATTER WHAT I DO OR HOW MUCH I STALL I STILL RUN INTO THE RUSSIAN. AND OF COURSE HE KILLS ME. CAN YOU HELP ME TO AVOID THIS??THANK YOU SHARONE
2,Horrible,"Maybe I am jaded by games like Grim Fandango, and the longest journey. I just want more to a game than jerky graphics and trying to find a plot, by being in the right place at the right time. The plot should be the programmers responsibility and not mine."
5,The Last Express is one of a kind,"This game is truly one of a kind. There is absolutely no other game that can come close to it. I bought this game in 1997 and have played it as recently as today! It's that entertaining. Beautiful visuals aside, the story of The Last Express is breathtaking. Although a sequel had been planned, Smoking Car Productions has sadly disbanded, ending the deal. However, I have exciting news that a movie version is in the works, with both Jordan Mechner and Tomi Pierce supervising. My advice is to buy this game and then go see the movie:) More game developers need to take their cue from this game, if more games came close to this one I'd buy them as fast as they could make them."
4,great game,"Superb voice acting, touching and engrossing story. A little difficult, but most pc games are difficult. This game however, is worth the effort."
3,I like,"I ordered one. i cant wait to get it i got the same one as my friend and i love the way it looks on the ds's so yeah and for all those who buy and then want to take off too bad, the arent the best at that but there is stuff u can buy to help take it off."
1,left sterling in for 5 hours & it didn't work!,"I ordered this for an intricate sterling pin that a cloth wouldn't work for. The item I tried it on was pretty tarnished. It had an amber centerpiece. I left the piece in for 5 hours. The sterling was barely changed, sill very tarnished. The amber, formerly shiny, was now dull and no amount of polishing would restore it. Jewelry now is a throwaway!"
3,"Not bad, but there's better available","This jewelry cleaner works, but it may take a lot of work. You have rub every piece and crevice in order to make it shine. I've used plenty of other cleaners in the past where merely soaking the jewelry will get it clean and sparkling. So if you don't mind the work, then buy it. However, if you expect to soak it and be done this is not the product for you."
2,Not as good,I did not find it to be very good. Bought by reading the good reviews and got fooled I guess. It doesn't do a very good job. I would say it is just an okay product.
3,"WONDERFUL PRODUCT, POOR DESIGN","I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A 5 STAR RATING. JUST PUTTING MY JEWELS IN THE SOLUTION FOR ABOUT AN HOUR MAKES THEM LOOK BRAND NEW!!! INCLUDED IS A LITTLE SCRUBBER THAT IS HARD TO HANG ONTO-SO I NEVER USE IT. THE POOR PACKAGING I SPEAK OF, MAY HAVE BEEN AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. ONCE I TOOK THE TOP OFF IT WOULD NOT SCREW BACK ON. NOW, I CAN'T TAKE IT WITH ME ANYWHERE AS IT LEAKS LIKE CRAZY. BUT OTHER THAN A LEAKY TOPPER...IT'S A SHOW STOPPER."
1,Hagerty Jewelry Cleaner,"It does ""not"" clean - it actually does nothing. I cleaned my rings yesterday and after rinsing them off, they did not shine at all. I do not like it and will not be using it or purchasing it again, what a waste of $."
2,"Works okay, but horrible packaging","This cleaner works just fine. That being said, the bottle leaks like crazy even when closed. It leaked so much that I kept it in a zip lock bag, which began to smell terrible.I ended up throwing it away. Waste of money because of the horrible packaging."
4,"Works great, the packaging not so much...","This cleaner worked great on my diamond wedding rings. I'm with everyone else re: the packaging. The plastic cover does not remove easily, therefore making it very difficult to create a tight seal with the lid. If the company improved the packaging, I would change my review to 5 stars. It's a great value for the price!"
5,Easiest Polish Ever,"This polish works phenomenally! It only takes a quick dip for a few seconds (literally, just seconds!) and your silver looks brand new. It's a great value."
3,Hard on little knees,"Tunnel is durable, well built, sturdy. Steel coil can definitely hurt little knees. My son was bruised on both knees the first time he played. We ultimately put a long excercise mat through it for some protection.. kind of a pain"
3,"Fun, But Lacks Articulation","The Clone Pilot is pretty neat, but I have to disagree with folks who claim he has all the articulation he needs. The elbows on the figure don't actually bend - they're fixed at an angle and they rotate. So if you want to extend the figure's arm, you have to swivel his elbow to the right spot. That makes positioning difficult and I've already had his arm pop off at the elbow a couple of times from this. If you want articulation, check out the Clone Trooper or Clone Commander."
4,"Worth it for the very entertaining 2,000 Women","The films in this excellent set have been processed to look fine despite their age . For my taste the two most enjoyable titles are Unpublished Story , based on the very real attempts of sincere pacifists and fascist sympathizers to keep the Brits from fighting the Nazis and 2,000 Women with Phyllis Calvert and a wonderful female cast as captive English citizens in a hotel prison contolled by Germans .with"
4,Creepy but goes no where,"I really liked this series. I've been into ghost inspired anime like Ghost Hunt and Another right now and this fit the bill perfectly. It was creepy and unique. Unfortunately there's no direction. The Wandering Mushi Master is just that: he wander from one place to the other and never really ends up anywhere. There is no story arcs and no end of the road. It's fun for what it is an each episode is entertaining enough and is a self contained story, but I'd say the series as a whole is plotless."
2,"Great ideas, no organization","This book has some really fun, practical ideas for residents new to New York, but they're organized along random, loose lines, with neighborhoods as subsections. Do the authors list video delivery? If they do, would it be in ""Treats,"" ""Traumas"" or ""Tripping""? If it is listed, is it sublisted in my neighborhood? Oh, and where was that description of a store that has every button imaginable--which category and then in which neighborhood? There's no index. The table of contents doesn't offer a clue. Maddening."
2,"Interesting, but not very helpful","This is a cute little book that would probably be fun for someone who had recently moved to New York City and was trying to find their way to fun things to do and see. We didn't find it very useful for our very brief visit to the city. The references to fun places to have ""girl stuff"" done were intriguing, and, as I said, would probably be fun for someone who lived in the city. Overall, for planning a quick visit -- or a first-time visit -- I don't think people would find this book very helpful."
5,A real lifesaver,I have recently relocated to New York City and could not have made it without this book. I usually pride myself in keeping up with what's happening - but I must admit this book has made my life much much easier with less effort. I am going to Paris in the fall - please tell me they will have one for Paris ssssssoooooonnnnnnnnn? (I have given several away to friends and they love them too.)
5,"very, very savvy","Savvy in the City is truly the first guide book I have actually followed! It is easy to use (divided by needs and locations), funny to read, and most of all true to its words."
4,Pretty Good.,"The book is great for the most part. I loved that it had maps in the first few pages and it had some reccomendations I had not seen in other New York books. However, it did not mention as to whether it was cheap, middle of the road or expensive."
4,Gift for Dad. Loves it.,"Everything went as advertised, and I recommend this vendor. Only drawback was delay between order date and date item was picked up for shipment was a few days longer than I anticipated,"
5,Spartacus/Khachaturian,Portions of this work were used in the BBC Oneden Line in the 1980s. The title had me baffled for years until I checked the reviews. I was surprised and extremely pleased to have the entire version.
5,Ansel Adams 2006 Wall Calendar,What can be said about the beauty of Ansel Adams work that has not already been said? The calendar will highlight any wall and make any room glisten. Great price too!
5,Best Socks in the World!,"I've been wearing these socks for years while I've been running or otherwise not having to be ""dressed up."" They last for years, are comfortable, warm and really cushion my old feet! None better."
2,Thorlo socks,"In the past, this brand of socks has been my absolute favorite and well worth the price. However, this pair was awful. They pilled horribly after the first wash, and looked like they had been worn for years. Don't waste your money."
5,Great Socks,"I didn't care for the blue part coming up back of sock, but these socks are great. They're really thick and well made. I'm buying more."
3,Used to Be a Fan,"I used to love these overpriced but long lasting socks, but am now done with them. They changed the sizing. I have a size 13 foot and these are way too large. It feels weird to complain about a sock being too large, but these socks are enormous."
4,"Great sock for running and high-tops alike, but expensive and with limited colors","Great for basketball too -- with high cushioning. Just wish they didn't cost so much; buy them for a teen at boarding school who loses socks like crazy! Oh, and wish they came in more/better colors as well."
5,Great socks,"Thorlio Thick cushion running socks are my favorite socks. I have walked,run,trainned in them.I find them comfortable and cushionning when I have to do a lot of walking on hard floor surfaces like shopping centers. Since purchesing my first pair over 15 years ago,I do'nt want to wear other socks."
1,Sent the wrong type running sock,"Unfortunately, after I gave these to my husband for Christmas we realized that I had been sent the mini crew instead of what he wanted (which is shown in the photo), a regular crew sock. So I returned them."
4,Seems like a good shoe so far...,"Don't you hate it when someone writes a review after only 1 day of wearing the product? Well... this is another one of those...It's good so far. When I read the reviews, they said the shoe fits large, so get a full size smaller. I usually am between at 10.5 and 11, so i got a 10.5... should have got the 10 as they are just a bit big. But i'm guessing they will form to my feet fine, just like any other all leather shoe. The insole feels good to walk in, the leather is flexible, and overall, for the price, think it will work out well...If this changes, I will let you know sometime in the coming days!"
2,"Good shoe, Crappy sole","I bought these shoes 11 months ago and have worn less than 50 times total. One sole split entirely and the other is starting to pull away from the stitching. They are a very comfortable shoe, which is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1. Incidently, the Sperry Top Siders these replaced were over 10 years old."
5,For Any History Buff,A great book for any history or military buff. I bought two more copies as gifts after I finished reading it. It's formatted for an extremely easy read. You will not be disappointed.
3,"Good, but:","A seeming clone of Ben Schott's books- however some of the origins (""stiff upper lip"", ""hooker"", others) are folk etymology, and some of the 'facts' presented may not be quite as accurate as the author would probably like them to be. The organization of the book is fairly haphazard; American Civil War pieces are next to WWII, WWI, and medieval-period factoids, which is a bit like taking a bite of everything on the plate at one time- which for some like me is fine, but if you like organization, it could drive you batty. This is a good curiosity-book, but I wouldn't want to depend entirely on it for military history."
2,Dissappointing,"Whereas the gestalt of Wabi Sabi is subtle and mysterious, unfortunately the approach of this book is obvious and superficial. Wabi Sabi cannot be relegated to the antique, imperfect and used but permeates our everyday lives. There is wabi sabi in the ordinary. The approach of this book is just too precious and simplistic. Find an alternative that is more contemplative and thoughtful."
2,Inauthenticity?,"As an enthusiastic student of chado and the Japanese arts in general, I bought this book thinking I would learn something new about wabi and/or sabi. Simultaneously I also purchased the Koren book Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers. In an oddly disturbing way, both books have uncanny similarities in their conceptual and pictorial approaches--except that the Koren book is vastly more insightful, more beautiful, and was written nine years earlier! What's going on?"
4,My Wabisabi Review,"I bought the book because I enjoy almost all things Japanese, but didn't know much about this subject. The center of my interest has always been Zen Buddhism and the martial arts. This is an interesting and well-rounded presentation of the subject."
4,ANOTHER EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY BUT ALL THREE VOLUMES SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMBINED!,"This is the second documentary in a series of three. The DVD runs about 50 minutes and is packed with great footage and juicy horror tid bits. 'Bride of Monster Mania' focuses on the women of horror. I actually learned more from this one than the first DVD and found this ""doc"" to be worthy of any horror fans collection. Elvira is back, not only to introduce the program this time, but to narrate. My only gripe is that with the short length of these features they should have been combined on one DVD to save buyer's of this product shelf space and money.....Oh greed is a terrible thing! :-("
5,ITS ABOUT TIME,I first saw this during AMC's Monsterfest a few years ago. And what tookso long for female horror characters to be recognized. I bought this amonth ago when I noticed it was available. This DVD helped as being a guide to discovering other horror movies. And Elvira as host added that touch. The DVD describes how woman shapped horror movies from the silent films to today. I do highly recomend this DVD for all horror fans.
4,Kitty Litter Smells Gone!!,"I've been using this for about 6 months. I originally purchased trying to clear up the cat box smell. No matter how many times you clean there always is a smell. I have tried everything you can think of and nothing has worked like Smells begone. It doesn't have a strong scent by itself, so if you want to smell the flavor; this is not the product for you. I actually didn't even realize it was working the first time I used it, it wasn't until the first container stopped working that I really realized how well it worked. Since the first used, if I question if it is working I'll remove the container from the area for a couple days to see if I can tell a difference.The down side is how expensive this is on Amazon. My local Bed Bath and Beyond sells this 2 for 9.99, unclear if they can be purchased anywhere else."
1,Product Review,"I am SO disappointed with this product. It simply DOES NOT work. Sits in the bathroom and I cannot smell a thing. Does NOT deodorize, does not do anything.Highly unhappy. Think twice."
2,Not great as read in the reviews,I read the reviews and spent so much on this product with a assumption that I would have a really odourless and fresh room. However I don't smell odour but there is no lavender feeling at all. I expected much more than what I got for the price I paid. It does not worth the price.
3,Sent wrong fragrance,"I ordered this in Lavender. They sent Lavender Vanilla. Not worth time or $ to exchange, but there is definitely a difference. Scent is much sweeter, which I'm not crazy about."
5,Excellent!,There's nothing much to say. A Good book is a GOOD BOOK! This is an essential if you want to understand more about vocal pedagogy.I read it over a weekend - and I feel inspired!!! This is defiately one little book i am going to open again and again!
4,Lamperti Wisdom - Vocal Philosophy for Singers,"Lamperti was a famous voice teacher in the ""old school"" of bel canto. The wisdom found in this small book is best suited for the person who already is a singer, and is looking for sage advice about the ""art."" This is provided in small statements and paragraphs - rather like ""info-bytes"" from a great master. The beginner may end up with more questions than answers. The more advanced singer will want to make this a book to ""live with"" over a period of many years. A book for the ""New Age"" from a sage of old."
3,a sad ending,"Although the editorial reviews do a good job of describing the story and beautiful illustrations, I feel they left out a couple of important details. First, the ending is SAD...the bird dies and the prince's heart breaks in half. And second, the last page talks about God and his angels. This seemed out of place to me as the rest of the book did not have a religious tone. I thought a potential buyer might like to know that."
4,Good book to start for PPP-debug-novice,I need to debug PPP a lot on cisco routers and it gave me a good understanding of the subject. cisco web site has enough info on debuggin PPP and this books goes in conjuction with it along with the relevant RFCs. I didnt find any other book addressing the debugging issues addressed in this book. I'm looking forward to a/the sequel!
3,PR? Yes. Informative? Yes. Not the whole story? Yes.,"This book certainly contains a wealth of information concerning what the religion of Scientology is all about. It discusses what an individual scientologist does, as a member of this group, and as a practitioner of the religion. It also explains the benefits of receiving scientology counseling and training, and the activities of (some) of the social groups that the Church acts as an umbrella organization for. It doesn't talk about what is called"
3,Fantastic Data!,"This book helped me to realize that I had no idea what Scientology was about before. I had heard so many different strange ideas from my friends. So, I wanted to find out for myself. What I found is that this stuff is so spot on! It works and it makes total sense! This is totally amazing! I am now reading ""Diantetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health"". I would advise everyone else to read from the source of Scientology also."
5,A great overview of Scientology,"For the person who has heard about Scientology, whether it be good or bad, this book gives a good overview of the basic ideas behind Scientology, as well as an excellent description of its various facets, including how auditing works, what courses are available, and some statistical information on the demographics of Scientologists.It's a good way to get a first-hand look at exactly what Scientology is about for those who have heard about it or are interested to find out more."
5,A book about the Religion and it's happy parishioners.,I had many of my questions answered about the controversyof Scientology. I always wondered why someone would wantto attack something that helped so many people live betterlives. I also had many misunderstandings of what Scientologyreally was about. This book has a compelling introductionand a question answer section that really made sense.I was fascinated by the many different types of people whofound help through the writings of Mr. Hubbard. This bookis a MUST READ.
5,Eye opening,"I read this book and found it quite eye opening as to what Scientology was really about.....it sure is nothing like those people who say they ""know all about it"" say!I then visited one of the Scientology Centers and found it a refreshing change to be allowed to be myself and to know that here was a place that I could work to improve myself and to enhance what was good about me to better myself, my family and my work."
5,This book invites one to decide for oneself,"I picked up this book because I had personalexperience with how well the Hubbard Study Technology works with young adults who have been illegitimately passed through our education system yet did NOT even learn how to read. I witnessed young people being happy to find out that they COULD indeed learn. They also thereafter were increasingly interested in becoming contributing members of their community. The chapter on this Study Technology did not say other than what I personally witnessed.I wasn't fully aware of the other things which can be improved using Scientology principals. If the topics covered in other chapters get even half the results claimed, it would be a good thing for society at large. I plan to look into it personally and decide for myself."
5,An introduction to the fastest growing religion on earth,This book gives an introduction and overview of What is Scientology and answers to the most commonly asked questions of this applied religious philosophy and why it is attracting the most able individuals who want to make this world a better place for everyone to live. I have read this book and found great value in the evolution of man's search for meaning in a hectic world. This book should be followed by the Scientology Handbook which contains many effective methods of using Scientology to improve one's life. The two are invaluable reference texts and contain a wealth of practical information for anyone wanting to improve the game of living life well
5,find out for yourself,"I am one of those that likes to find out for myself. If you have been wondering about Scientology, this answers all the important questions. Much better place to find out than any other place else I have looked. There is a ""common questions"" section that covers all the things anyone might be wondering about or have heard about Scientology. It is always better to get information from the real source in my opinion. Find out what they say, it is pretty cool."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY","This is the worst kids video I've ever seen, the acting is awful, the rapping is criminal & they have no understanding of yoga postures, kids or how to teach to kids."
1,Absolutely dreadful - complete waste of money,"Let there be no misunderstanding - obviously the goal here was ""edutainment"" but the result is one of the most pathetic efforts I have ever witnessed. I have seen high school productions with higher quality, better scripts and far better on-camera personalities. This gave the impression that it was produced in someone's basement by people with no experience working with children. They try WAY too hard to be ""fun & zany"" and the results are disjointed fragments of postures and philosophy. My child loves the YogaKids series but refused to watch more than just a few minutes of this horrible video."
1,Wierd,"My kids love this video. My 4 yr old asks for it and my 2 yr old watches it. I find it bizzare and I frustrated by the wierdness ""become the animals"", ""words of power"", ""if you will it- it will happen"", ""chant Home"". The boys seem to like the girls though so I allow them to watch. Don't buy this for your kids though if you are looking for a exercise video."
5,Great physical activity and captivating for children,"I love this video. I'm not the only one, my son is continually asking for it to be played; not just once, but over and over again. It's a great way for him to get up and move, unlike most every other video you can buy. He is only 2 and has already started to learn Yoga. He anticipates each new part of the video and moves along with the music and the poses. The music is so groovy, I can't seem to get it out of my own head. I'm caught singing at my job all the time. I love that it is up to date and can keep the attention of children of many ages."
2,animal yoga,"This was a waste of time and money. If it had come with a money back guarantee, I would demand it now. This was really bad."
2,my 2-year old likes this; I don't,"This is a poor introduction to yoga. On the plus side, my daughter seems engaged by some of it, and it does encourage movement and teaches some fun poses, but it is way too fast-paced and busy, with constant silly interruptions. The story line is practically non-sensical. I am amazed that it even claims on the package to be appropriate for children with ADH. I am not an ADH expert, but, this video is unfocused. The music is a bit raucous and irritating. I was also hoping for more real footage of African animals, but there is hardly any. Overall, disappointing!"
1,"It should be called ""The No-yoga Video""!","This is neither a yoga video not an excericise video of any kind! What a waste of my money!! This video has no African plains, and no safari (unless you count about 5 cartoon animals that flittered through the screen). And there is practically no yoga. If I wanted a video of a bunch of people doing a bit of hip-hop I would have gotten one! Practically nothing is explained. There are two annoying adult women pretending to be dumbed down ""fun"" little girls. There is a half-naked man. There is lots of loud noise and bright colors, and people pretending to be having fun. But there is zero real content or meaning. Did I mention that if you blink you'll miss the ""yoga""?"
2,The kids don't like it,I have a small home daycare and thought this would be great to get the kids up and moving during the long cold winter. Well they range in age from 4 1/2 to 2 and they all hate it. It's not that long and no children were left even looking at it by the time it ended. There were too many weird interuptions and not enough movement and following along. I would not recommned this at all.
1,Not much yoga here,"This dvd was a dissappointment. There are lots of gimmicks, strange adults trying too hard, kids doing break dance and other non-yoga related moves. Basically there is minimal yoga, the format is all over the place, it's not fun or easy to follow."
1,Title: good. Book: bad,"Narrow, incomplete and pretentious, as are Ms. Muske-Dukes' poems and poetic opinions."
1,Poorly designed,Their previous design used to be a great nail puller but this thing is just a cumbersome lump of metal. Everyone that I know who has ordered this chunk to replace a lost one now just leaves it in the car (or at the dumpster) & has gone back to the other brand.
1,A Poor Patchwork of Video Files,"This DVD (and other similarly titled Madacy offerings) is little more than a boring assemblage of news file footage strung together with narration. If all of the truly interesting parts were placed in a single presentation, there might be perhaps five minutes of worthwhile video.The DVD is poorly and very cheaply produced, an experience I have had with all of Madacy's productions."
1,Defective Audio on 2nd Half of DVD,There is no sound on part 2 (1990-1999). Part 1 (1980-1989) is ok. I exchanged for another disk. Same result.
1,Buyer be warned,"Beware of this product! Fermentation makes soy more digestable for humans - - Braggs Liquid Aminos is not fermented. Additionally, Braggs does not contain less sodium than regular soy sauce, rather, it contains slightly MORE sodium than soy sauce.I used to purchase this product regularly, under the misunderstanding that it was a healthier alternative to soy sauce. This is not accurate.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this product."
2,A another way to make soy sauce,Flavor is good. It is an hydrolized product (acids added to break down the soy). I prefer soy sauce.
3,good not great,I had heard of the health benefits associated with Bragg's Amino Acids but should have done the research first;* is higher in sodium than my Lite Soy Sauce.* this contains MSG.* I prefer the taste of soy sauce to this product.TIP: if you are concerned about your sodium intake but still want to use soy sauce the *LITE* Kikkoman Soy Sauce actually has LESS sodium in it than their Lower Sodium Soy Sauce.For my tastes/purposes this product did not have any appreciable health benefits over my lite soy sauce and therefore I would probably not purchase this again.
1,Too Salty to Eat,"I used to buy this product about twenty years ago. It was a nice alternative to soy sauce. However, the formula seems to have changed drastically over the years. I have always used salt very generously. In fact, family and friends have often warned me of the unhealthy level of salt I use. However, I can't even eat, ""Bragg's Liquid Aminos."" I put a little on my rice. It was so overwhelmingly salty that I had to rinse the rice with water. Even then it was unpalatable. I am in agreement with those who say they are going back to soy sauce. With the amount of sodium that must be contained within this product, it certainly couldn't be healthy. Yuck!"
1,Awful - and useless,"When I ordered this amino mixture, I assumed that it would make my very limited HCG diet food taste better. WRONG!!! This stuff tastes like super salty soy sauce - with an added rancid flavor. I poured it down the sink."
5,Bragg liquid aminos,"This is great. Any recipe calling for soy sauce, I substitue with Bragg Liquid aminos. Thank you."
5,Best salad ingredient,I use this product along with flax seed oil on my salad. You don't need to add salt. Love this item. HIghly recommend you giving it a try.
3,Soy sauce for one and all!,Don't plan to put this in a smoothie or a shake but it is a great replacement for soy sauce.
1,Poor Packaging,When I received this package the bottle had leaked all over the inside. This bottle was placed in an envelope and it should have been in a box. I am very disappointed that this product was not packaged and shipped better as I lost half of liquid due to it leaking so bad.
2,Silly Marketing,"This stuff is unfermented soy sauce. I don't know what fermentation does for soy sauce, but what I know is that my low-sodium tamari soy sauce has about the same nutritional value as Bragg but tastes a whole lot better. Don't be fooled by the small serving size in Liquid Aminos, the sodium content is high; this is not a low sodium food (my tamari sauce contains less sodium per volume, and it's still high). The amino acid profile means nothing in small quantities, it's not like anyone drinks soy sauce for its protein. A half-dime sized piece of tofu contains more amino acids than a serving of this.I recommend you go for a high quality Asian brand of low sodium soy sauce. It'll taste better, and it'll be at least as healthy."
4,Good for you... doesn't taste that great :-),"Buy & use for the benefits of the amino acids but not for a tasty soy sauce replacement. It does, however, mix easily half & half with soy sauce in recipes & no one will notice that they're getting a health jolt. This is a basic product for your pantry.-> Note: I was surprised that the Amazon price was better than my local grocery.Here's from the website:""Bragg Liquid Aminos has a shelf life of 5 years; although due to its nature, Bragg Liquid Aminos can be safely used for many years after expiration."""
1,"Bottles broken, leaking","Both bottles arrived soaked in the product in plastic bags. When I opened the bag of one and picked up the bottle, Amino acids squirted everywhere. Both bottles arrived like this. I'm very unhappy that the packager did not adequately package the bottle, considering that the product is not only a mess but undoubtedly contaminated and unusable. Very disappointed."
5,Yummy and Healthy!,Became familiar with Bragg liquid aminos about 20 years but fully got on board when I witnessed several times the toddler child of a friend refuse to eat his broccoli unless he actually saw Bragg liquid aminos put on it. I have steamed broccoli with Bragg liquid aminos almost every day. Good stuff!
4,Bragg Liquid Aminos is the way to go!,It's healthy & taste good...no brainer!!! It's also a great substitute for seasoning on vegetables and/or for a stir fry.
2,Poorly edited CD; dishonest?,"Very poorly-edited CD; I can't believe that it was ""Released by arrangement with the Gerorge Gershwin Estate"", as the booklet states. Consider the following: Upon playing the CD for the first time, I noticed that Track 4, ""Grievin' For You"" was actually was the same as track 11, ""Make Believe"". Naturally, I was quite surprised that this error wasn't caught pre-release. I was also disappointed, since I was looking forward to hearing ""Grievin' for you"". Also, in the booklet it states that track 14, ""An American in Paris"", was recorded in 1928. I was hoping to hear a historical recording when in fact the track contains a stereo recording of the piece, and is thus in all likelihood a post-1957 recording. I wrote to the publisher of the CD, TKOMagnum, but have not received a response. Let the buyer beware!"
1,Ginuwine should sue whoever tarnished his name,"Giuwine bombed with his respectable yet overlooked and under promoted last album Back II Basics and a little over a year later he's totally disrespected by some wack DJ with this CD release. Truth be told Ginuwine is only on two songs and neither one really show's G's true vocal talent. Avoid this CD at all costs and if I can offer any advice to Ginuwine for your next CD I would hook up with Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, The Underdogs, Polow Da Don and Sean Garret for your next CD."
1,Ginuwine fans DON'T waste YOUR money,"This Is not an official Ginuwine Album...This Junk Is Garbage,except for that ""Like Me"" track with Loon.I was very disapointed after this purchase,I suggest you take my word for it and pass this one up on the shelf...."
5,Great new honest show! 5 stars!!! Awesome show of real issues and women sharing about them.,I love this new show. It is so real and down to earth. Amanda is a great interviewer who is vulnerable herself in the interviews. I will be watching all of the season! Love it.
5,Beautiful introduction to visual diary-keeping,"In my 15 years of keeping a diary, I spent the first 10 keeping a conventional written record of thoughts, ideas, and occurances. But about 5 years ago my diary keeping received a pleasant and unexpected jolt when I encountered Hannah Hinchman's 'A Trail Through Leaves: The Journal as a Path to Place'. This beautifully written and illustrated book on keeping a visual diary completely enlarged my ideas of what a diary could be: a visual record as well as a meditation on the material universe."
5,What a fantastic book! A must for all writers and artists!,This book is a breath of delight. Any writer who is serious about capturing the natural or personal world needs to keep this book at the bedside (and another one in the car!)
1,such potential....such bias,"If you are a biologist or scientist who also does art, this book may be as offensive to you as it was to me. This person presents an approach to 'seeing' which she suggests is the only true way to see. She gives extensive examples of how blind biologists/scientists are to the world. Her pretention only uncovers her own ignorance. I had such high hopes for this book. I had hoped to improve my field sketching skills. The only information I got from this book was an updated list of supplies. No useful technique information. Quite a bit of quirky annoying dogma."
1,MISLEADING DESCRIPTION,Photo and shipping weight imply 4 items. In fact price is for just one - ten times the price of other sellers!
3,A tragedy remains a mystery,It all seems to remain a mystery...a lying old man with too large an ego or a terribly disturbed young woman who may have been 'abused' for years by the older man...has 48 Hours looked into this tragedy?
2,what suspension?,"this offers little, if any, suspension for me. it does not move smoothly very often. it seems to stick and offer very little suspension for me. i am 205 pounds. in my opinion, the up-down motion of this seatpost is not condusive to proper suspension for a bicycle. your seat does not exactly move up and down when going over bumps. it moves more like a front-to-back motion. the tamer pivot DOES operate correctly as designed. it's the design that is the problem. while this suspension seatpost does perform some suspension duties, in my opinion, no suspension seatpost of this design will do much since the up-down motion is not conducive to the natural motion of the seat needed for proper suspension. i hope this makes sense."
3,Average,"This movie was not bad, but not great. I bought it because I'm a fan of the leading man; he is gorgeous. The performances are good, production values are good, but the story is predictable.All in all, it was worth watching, but I doubt I will watch it again."
2,seriously lacking,"Though this movie had a lot of potential, it is pretty much ruined with over-the-top stereotypical characters, very contrived situations, and a predictable plot. Too bad, because I liked the leads, but only Ellen Pompeo's character has any real believability. Perhaps many of the side characters were being portrayed in a tongue in cheek manner, but the comedy here is not smart, and falls flat over and over again. The last quarter of the movie attempts to move towards a more serious dramatic climax, but by this time suffers from such a credibility problem, that it too falls short of any real revelation, insight, or endearment. A disappointment."
5,clymer review,Everyone who has a Honda Odyssey FL250 needs this book. It contains very helpful information on how to service and maintain your Odyssey. I've found the information to be very accurate as well. Bottom line: this should be in the garage of every Odyssey owner.
2,unfortunately l could not appreciate the material,"my dvd was not compatlble to the disc , so l was not able to appreciate the matarial."
5,Read this book if you are curious about reincarnation!,"Jenny Cockell's remarkable story -- of returning to find her family of several children, decades after her death -- is a book I couldn't put down. Read it as fiction (which it is not) and you've got a great story. Read it as fact and start asking yourself questions about life, and death and life-after-life."
1,Don't let 5 star reviews cloud your judgement,"After reading such glowing reviews, I sent for this book. When I saw that the only review on the back cover did not come from a publication I knew I had made a mistake. I did not like the book. The emotion of the author seemed genuine but I didn't get caught up in the story. Maybe if I had seen the T.V. program described by others it might have helped. If I had read the reviews more carefully I might have saved myself some money."
5,Amazing.,"Being born a ""Druze"" ( a religion in the Middle East,basically in Lebanon,Israel,Jordan), I totally understand this story & can relate as I had heard many true stories of previous memories of past lives of people. My parents come from ""Mimes,Hasbaya"" in South Lebanon & over there this belief is predominant since it a central belief in Druze's religion & parents of young children ie less than 5 years old,do encourage their young children to ""Talk"" about any previous memories rather than rediculing them & they do go to check whether these places,events,names etc are real or not & in many cases they are.Actually my grandfather was re-incarnated & told many of his previous life & documented as true. A very good book"
5,Enjoyed this book very much,"I read about this book in People magazine (a few years ago) and rushed out to buy it. It is well written, (a little dry in places) but the overall story is wonderful. I so hope this is an honest account, which I feel it is. It's a keeper and I will read it again!"
5,A little gem! Great ideas and easy application for everyday life!,"Moren's book, Gospel Stories, is an opportunity to connect with your family, church community and those wanting to relate on a deeper level by using daily topics that faciliate meaningful conversation. It takes a special gift to 'connect' with others and Moren demonstrates his skill in this area by giving you tips that allow you to relate with others and especially children, in an inviting, warm and eduational dialogue that transcends a basic topic and invites relationship building.This book, while teaching core concepts of spirituality, also helps explore the development of a child's value system and builds a familial relationship and church experience that cannot be forgotten and continues to add value to one's existence. A treasured tool for those in the clergy and a valuable tool for anyone wanting to invest in their child's development."
3,Nice - but a bit dated,"This video could use some updating, but it does offer some nice documentary-style footage of the Cayman Islands and some nice underwater shots. It's pace is rather slow, though (you'd swear the narrator is the Perry Como of documentaries!)."
2,Charles Dickens Collection Movies,"With the exception of David Copperfield, I found the movies outdated in appearance with black and white color. I was overall disappointed with this product"
2,Not that great.,"I expected the movies in this collection to be the most current. Unfortunately, half of the movies have another version out that is newer and better. A little disappointing. I should have researched this product more thoroughly before buying."
4,The Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships: Decoding Social Mysteries Through Unique Perspectives of Autism,I found this book very helpful in helping me understand why my daughter was unsuccessful in may social situations. It opened my eyes to body language. Through this understanding I was able to break down certain social situations and teach appropriate social skills. Temple Grandin opened many doors. Read about our journey through autism to Functioning Recovery and independent living in Coming Through the Fog.Coming Through the Fog: A mother shares her journey of her daughter's recovery from Autism and Sensory Processing Disorder to Functioning Recovery and ... providing helpful tips for other parents.
3,Autism,"This is an interesting book written by someone who has become extremely successful, while dealing with the challenges of autism. Congratulations to you, Temple."
5,Great Book that helped me to understand my son!,I can't say enough good things about this book it has opened realms about my son that I didn't get before I read it I have shared it with educators and other parents of Aspies! it's great get it!!!!
3,Great for Parents....Not so much for patients,"I have Asperger's Syndrome, so you would think this book would've helped me. And while I could identify with a few aspects of the authors' experiences with Asperger's, I found precious little that could help me cope with life in the non-autistic world. The book goes into great detail about how to raise, teach, and help folks with autism and Asperger's, but it doesn't really offer much for folks who have the syndrome. Then again, I've yet to find a book written as a guide specifically for aspies. Most of the literature out there is geared toward teachers and parents. I guess they figure we can't handle it :P"
2,Very disappointing,"slightly interesting book, but I bought it hoping to learn some basic social rules. Very few specific rules are given, and instead, lots of information on authors' early lives. Some information on how to interact with aspie children, which is fine, but this was not at all evident from the title or cover."
4,Another Dickens classic,"If you like Dickens' books you will certainly appreciate this TV version with its authentic recreation of Victorian times. This 1983 BBC miniseries was created with a limited budget, but it is well worth watching. Will Dombey find an heir to his business after his son tragically dies since the family inheritance is so important? He is a strange fellow locked in his own status, something which the elite valued so highly at that time.The DVD is double sided and includes the entire miniseries of almost five hours in length. It is really a bargain for the amount of material it contains. The only thing these BBC series don't have is the more elaborate sets of the Dickens' big screen movies made over the years. But with the fine characters and actors who played them, the programs had a standard of high quality. And being divided into episodes adding up to longer time in total than the films, they offered much more of the books' original stories."
3,disappointed,i don't feel this adaption was a good representation of the novel and felt it finished before the story finishedI also would have liked to have had the DVD compatable with Australian standards
2,This one was really bad,"I must have given it away, I had to get it out of my house. I love british drama, but this one left me empty"
3,Good but hope to see a remake,"Having not read the book yet, I enjoyed this movie. Dickens is a master. I discovered that it was filmed in the 80's and I hope that it is redone by Andrew Davies. Anyone having seen the early version of Bleak House and then the version done by Andrew Davies, will understand what I mean. Same story, huge difference in production values and acting."
4,Elk Fest,"I'm a big board game nerd, and when I first saw this game, I was very excited to try out something new and simple. The wooden pieces are nice and quality. The box is strong, and it all fits in nicely. It is actually quite difficult to flick the circles just right and get over the water to the other bank, which makes it fun for the kids! But, I suggest keeping the banks pretty close together. :)"
2,Doesn't work as advertised,"This sounds like such a good idea, but in actuality, it doesn't work. The sidwalk chalk and stencils work fine, but the stencils don't work with the ""stomperz."" The chalk dust comes flying out of these things in every direction and lands on everything *except* the stencil you're trying to make. Your child ends up covered in chalk dust (including up their noses!), but the stencil is still un-chalked. We were SO disappointed with this one!"
2,crayola chalk stomperz,"We were also disappointed with the product. My grandaughter is 6 yr. old. both of us tried to get the chalk out of the pad; but most was in the air and on us! The stencils are really nice. Using them with the chalk works, but for a 6 year old it's to slow. I think it would be good with the sidewalk paint instead. We had bought the other sidewalk toy using chalk and were also disappointed in it. It only goes forward and uses a lot of chalk. These look great, but did they try them on kids?"
5,Great comedy for the whole famiy!,"We are so thankful for all the Thou Shalt Laugh series because it is not very often that we can sit down together as a family andwatch comedy together. We all prefer clean but funny, professional humor. Not cheesy stuff where they are really stretching it to get a laugh.If you like funny, but not the trash, I highly recommend any of the TSL series!They make great SAFE gifts too. You won't offend anyone and laughter is the greatest gift you can give I think. Blessings! Kim"
1,The worst customer service computer company!!!!,If you want a computer company with the worst customer service... be my guest.. buy a dell computer!!!!!
5,Interpretative excellence!,"One of the main virtues of Radu Lupu has always been his impeccable fluency, interpretative brio, inexhaustible good taste, crystalline phrasing and expansive sonority.As a matter of fact my first contact with Lupu was precisely with the Grieg Piano Concerto and I must confess, this version engaged me, because of the profound conviction, and admirable lyricism.He has remained as one the most renowned pianists around the world, so you should acquire this legendary album that so many praised comments aroused in that decade.The Schumann's Piano concerto belongs to Ivan Moravec with the Czech Philharmonic; however this is a very solvent and distinguished performance."
5,dramatic concertos,These two romantic concertos are grandly dramatic exemplars of that era. The playing on this CD appropriately communicates that drama in crystal clear sound. I have heard the Schumann in several versions and consider this the best of the lot. Recommended without reservations.
4,Historical Romance,"This Avalon historical romance involves a volunteer soldier from the Mexican War, Luke Jackson, who has been selected to escort Melanie Faraday up to Las Vegas. Little does Luke know that three feisty little boys and a wailing baby will accompany Melanie on this potentially dangerous journey. Her powerful father has promised Melanie's hand in marriage to another but will Luke and Melanie give into their growing affections? Undoubtedly, but it's a charming trip worth taking for the fans of historical romances."
5,A Sure Pleaser in Santa Fe Sunrise,"Luke Jackson is the kind of hero we want our daughters to meet - a gentleman to the core (underneath trail dust and his rugged good looks, of course!) He may not know the first thing about kids when you meet him, but like anyone with a big heart, he's a quick learner in matters pertaining to people. And Melanie Faraday? She sets out on a mission that would make any parent proud - once you get over the shock at her willingness to put herself in danger! One line says it all about Melanie: ""Beneath the prim and proper surface of Melanie Faraday lay something magnetic and untamed. It drew him (Luke) to her, an attraction so heady it was diffcult for him to breathe...""This book is well-researched and flows so smoothly you won't put it down. The characters are motivated and well drawn, and the children will steal your heart. I'm looking forward to seeing more from Kathleen Fuller!"
5,BUY THIS CD!,"After buying another Runrig cd (30 year journey) and absolutely loving it, I decided to give this one a shot. After listening to it once, I was reminded why I love this band....modern instruments and older melodies and songs make an unlikely but winning combination in this cd. If you are a fan of celtic music with a contemporary twist, then stop reading and order this cd!"
4,Great Disc,"Fantastic disc. From the North is simply incredible. The rest of the disc is quite good, especially Heading to Acadia, but doesn't IMHO compare to From the North. Minor audio edit issues, but on the whole a very enjoyable disc. Excellent vocal clarity, lyrics, and instrumental skills. Definitely recommended =)"
4,Rainbows are good investments,"I was skeptical about buying the hemp version because I love the leather sandals so much but the hemp ones are actually more comfortable in my opinion. The narrow strap is cute but only thing I don't like about this sandal is it can look unappealing sometimes. And when it rains, these will also get that really disgusting feeling you get when wearing the leather ones but the plus side is you can wash them well whereas water just ruins leather."
3,Pretty comfortable but too big,"I ordered these in Large because the sizing guide said L is for sizes 7.5-8.5 and I always wear size 8 in shoes, but when I am wearing these, there is almost an inch of extra sandal behind my heel, and the sandals themselves feel really loose on my foot and kind of flop around when I walk, which definitely makes them a little hard to walk in. Aside from that, they are comfortable and I like the look and feel of the narrow strap."
4,Nanny or mom?,"The father of the boy passed away, so his brother became the guardian of the boy. As he was too busy, he employed a nanny to look after the boy. Soon there were sparks flying between the two adults."
3,e-commerce freedom,"I believe quixtar is going to be the first company on the internet to exceed one billion dollars on the internet. because they have the high touch and high tech. Because people are the key to this bussines,we step in to people's lives and serve them and become thier friend. Buiding relationships with people is the key to freedom."
1,don't waste the time (or money),"This is one more example of how the Quixtar (i.e Amway) people have figured out a method of making money from those who need to learn about how to navigate a web site; if the site were that good it wouldn't take detailed instructions to navigate. The Quixtar model is another failed attempt to capitalize on dot.com marketing, using an antiquated (MLM) business system that has no place in current retailing. Shame on the authors (independent IBO's that they are..) and their mentors (Yager, Britt, et al) who have apparently taught them the only real way to make money in the Amway-Quixtar system is by foisting books and materials (at substantial profit) on the unsuspecting masses that hope to capitalize on their ""dream"". Save your money - visit the Quixtar site and realize for yourself that it is poorly designed, appeals ONLY to Amway/Quixtar IBO's, and will not save a cent in terms of shopping dollars."
4,"Funny, funny, funny","The is a painstakingly practical book from a gifted, highly amusing writer. Although I am exactly twice the age of the intended readers, I found it splendid and have recommended it to twentysomethings adrift in this understudied stage of life."
2,"Exciting Premise, Boring Writing","I heard about this book on Dennis Prager's radio show. The plot and subject intrigued me, so I ordered it. The writing is bland and the characters are impossibly dull. This book made me appreciate Dean Koontz more. Koontz is not the greatest writer in the world, but you will do worlds better with him if you want to read X-Files-ish stories about occultish premises like reincarnation."
1,Very Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Joseph Telushkin, so I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book. What a disappointment. The writing is wooden, the characters flat, the plot unbelieveable. I was also surprised that some people still believe in pschoanalysis! Oh well, this is set in California, after all."
4,A Good Read!,"Just when you thought you had this marketing thing down, Mark Earls says it won't do you any good now. Marketing is out of sync with today's consumer-centric world of empowered customers and excess supply. In witty prose, Earls contends that creativity is more than catchy words, and he has plenty to say about the brand-as-experience phenomenon and about freeing yourself from convention. His sensible premise comes across as simplistic and nave. Saying that ideas are the key to success is a bit like saying that love conquers all - a noble sentiment, but vague and not really new. However, this doesn't pretend to be a how-to book; it's an idea book, and you interpret the ideas. An ad veteran, Earls provides ample examples and expert quotes on attitudes and behaviors. And if it isn't news that the market changes constantly, we note, it isn't fully understood either. If you want to understand, welcome to Earls' world."
5,CD very good,Short of Acid Jazz music and this CD is awesome.Came with good packaging and in good condition!Nothing against. I liked the cd very good to hear!
5,Tail gate seal,"I purchased this seal, rated the selling and now am asked to rate the seal again. It is a seal that goes around the tail gate. The seller shipped it quickly and did not rip me off. If I recall correctly, the shipping charges were a bit high, but what the heck, somebody had to pack it and get it mailed."
1,"Nice pics, but little else to offer.","While Trolls, by Jan Lindenberger, has tons of high quality color photos, it has little else to offer to troll collectors. The majority of the book is dedicated to modern trolls by makers other than Dam. The author values these modern trolls way above their actual value, while the vintage Dam trolls that she does include are often undervalued. She mixes modern and vintage Dam trolls on the same page with little or no commentary. Many of the vintage examples are in poor condition, with no explanation of how the condition might affect the value. While she gives the size and brand of most examples, some examples have no size or an incorrect size. She includes many vintage Dam trolls in a section simply labeled unmarked trolls with no indication that they were made by Dam. In this section she prices a clearly modern troll with neon, non-mohair hair, almost three times as much as a 1960's, mohair, dam troll."
1,Save your money,"This book was pretty much a waste of money. It includes pictures of fairly common trolls, not rare ones, and very little information. You can get almost as much information about trolls by simply browsing through E-Bay and you're likely to come across more exotic trolls in the process."
1,troll doll books in general,"the problem with most of the books on this subject, as i see it, is that most of them were written while some trolls were still in production. check the publication date in the front of the book, information amazon should provide to prospective buyers. that makes any of these books pretty much worthless in today's market in my opinion. troll dolls at that time were worth only the market values, not collector's values, such as in today's market, making the books a waste of money to collectors. i know i would not have purchased the two books i bought had i known date of publication. they are of little or no value to me."
5,i really need bookshelves,"just because my friend asked me, so i counted, i swear thats the only reason why i kno and i how i remember. WHATEVER. anyway... they dont have sex in THIS book. they do it twice in the second book. they're both good books. i definately rate this book a 5. anything lower would be an insult. unless your rating it a 4 for lack of sex. yaoi is so addicting."
3,Strickly for kids.,"This was the type of Manga for teenager into yaoi. Adults should probably stick to Kizuna, Fake and West End.I found the side stories more sexually explicit. No, don't think I'll buy the second novel."
4,Eccentric interpretation,"I can almost guarantee you have never heard the Four Seasons like this. There are abrupt changes in speed and dynamics throughout and some interesting trills and flairs. This is not an ""authentic"" performance, although it is clear Marriner put much thought into each phrase. While on the whole this is a fine version, and the remastered sound is excellent, it lacks a little bite in some key passages. Sometimes Marriner brings the orchestra to a hush at just the moment when I expect a climax. Perhaps I have been too conditioned by other versions I own. In any case, I prefer the version by Il Giardino Armonico on the Teldec label as my top choice."
2,I wanted to love this but I don't,I thought this would be an excellent recording of the Four Seasons but I found it lacking in many areas. It is so full of showy individualism and flamboyant virtuosity that it spoils the feel of the music and the cohesion of the picture projected. The tempo seemed wrong in parts and there were moments that were franky painful. I really wanted to like this but I like more traditional interpretations of this work.
4,"AN EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY BUT, THEY COULD HAVE COMBINED ALL THREE VOLUMES ON THIS ONE DISC!","I bought this DVD a while back and I didn't realize I had seen this program on AMC before. I am glad to have it as it is very interesting with good early horror footage and facts. Jack Palance host the program and Elvira introduces and ends the show for added fun. If I have one gripe, it's that the program is an hour long(62 minutes)and there are two more DVD's in the series(Bride of Monster Mania #2 and Attack of the 50 Foot Monster Mania #3). All three programs could have fit on this one DVD to make the set cheaper and take up less space on my ever shrinking DVD shelf! Greedy B a s t a r d s!"
5,Very comprehensive book dealing with all of Prussia,"This book is very good in that it not only goes into great detail about the Prussian army and the myriad battles and wars it fought, but also it explains the political, social, financial, monarchial, and geographic influences on the army itself, all of which were important. Many similar books have come out about the Prussian/German army, but this book excels at integrating the rest of Prussian life and culture into the book, which gives the reader a real feel as to why Prussia developed a paranoia about the rest of Europe and had to raise a huge army for hundreds of years."
2,Nice phone but only for pay-as-you-go,"The description of this phone says ""unlocked"" and I thought that meant it would work with any carrier. In reality, because it requires a SIM card, the major carriers won't touch it. I could not get it activated by any carrier I contacted. They all said the phone is set up for pre-paid service only. When one carrier tried to reset the flash memory for use on their system, they learned that this type of phone is not used in the US yet (it is approved for Canada and will be available soon in the US, but not currently). All in all, more trouble than it was worth. There should be a warning in the description of this item."
1,"Motorola razr v3i, It's still a work in progress","Unfortunately i received not a pristine unlocked phone, but an unlocked phone that had connections to a service provider. My phone is marred by chinese caligraphy. I'm not savvy in chinese and in this lifetime don't expect to be. Had the phone arrived tainted from italy or spain, australia or britain, i could have use it, I'm sure i could have figured it out. I ended up purchasing a razr i could use. I did attempt to contact the seller, after a few days they did respond, but not in a way i felt was useful. I wasn't able to reach them by telephone, so thankfully i could afford to be out of the money i spent on the phone, and it is beautiful to look at. I'm sure i will figure the phone out or how to change it eventually, but i need a phone now, thus my other purchase."
2,big ripoff,has good sound and reception. pictures are not that good. MP3 stinks as well. Don't try to transfer music files from pc or sync from media player like an mp3 player it won't happen. Manual for phone sinks as well. As for support well let's just say THERE IS NONE no help whatsoever. i gave it 2stars and that was generous.
1,SUCKS ASS,i hate it no style bad reception (i think its from sprint im moving to cingular everbody else has y not me) dont buy it not worth price only worth mabey 100- 120 $ not 300$
4,A Great Performance of the Nelson Mass,"This is a very powerful performance of the Nelson Mass, and the soprano does a beautiful job. The acoustics inside the cathedral are good, and the CD booklet has lots of historical information and plenty of photos. If you're not familiar with Haydn's choral music, many of them have a powerful, thunderous tone very different from much of his instrumental pieces. If you like this mass, you will love the opening and finale of Haydn's Seven Last Words of Christ. And, of course, the great oratorio, the Creation.I love Vivaldi's Gloria, but the first movement of this performance of the Gloria, however, goes way too slow and feels so heavy. Buy this CD for the performance of the Nelson Mass and consider buying another performance of Vivaldi's Gloria."
5,"Haydn's ""Lord Nelson Mass""",This CD was recommended to me by other members of the Ft. Myers Symphonic Mastersingers as we prepare to present it march 24th &25th in Ft. Myers and Naples. Both the vocal and symphonic performance on this CD has helped me to take in a near-perfect interpretation and gorgeous musical goal to do my very best to even try to reach their level of perfection on this CD
2,was looking for more,"The info in the book was fine, but I was looking for more. Very few of the techniques were applicable to me."
5,cute mat,"Cute mat..it's true to color on line, and washes great. Goes well with all my Christmas decorations in my bathroom"
5,Cute bath mat,This is one cheers my little girls every time they walk into their bathroom. The quality is also quite good for the price.
3,Not as good as expected,The plug was not as snug as I would like so any movement of the cord causes a little static or drop out.
2,2 Stars For 2 Albums On One CD,"Watch out folks! This is two CD's of early Aussie songs (great ones), but it is not digitally remastered! For a few bucks more you can get ""Brilliant From Birth"", a 63 song collection, remastered and filled with liner notes. A much better bargain available here at Amazon!"
3,Steve Vai - 'Real Illusions: Reflections' (Red Ink),"Steve Vai's most recent effort. I, personally wasn't as impressed as I was with, say his 'Sex And Religon' or 'Fire Garden' titles. So-so guitar virtuoso guitar-rock. Better cuts here include the adventurous ""Glorious"", ""Freak Show Excess"" and the awesome eight-minute rocker ""Under It All"". Notice that fellow guitar virtuoso (?) Tony MacAlpine lends a hand on this record, by providing some guitar, keyboards and vocals. Not sure which tracks he shows up on. Vai apparently had plenty of others helping him to record 'Real Illusions:Reflections'. Die-hards will get more out of this CD than most casual fans."
4,Student\geek\owner\happy,"Excellent price for this fine, notebook. Good Speed, plenty of Ram to start off with 256mb(with one extra empty slot for more)upgradable to 1gb NICE..But I find only two things wrong with this notebook, first the specs on amazon state there's a 1394 firewire port , sorry but there isn't. Second no floppy :-(. This note book is worth the money. Not for power users, but more for students."
5,First and Best Notebook Computer,I received this gem as a gift for Christmas. It will help give lectures and allow me to display pictures at schools with TVconnected by S Video cable. Most portable and easiest use system I have seen. A real pleasant surprise gift.
3,"Great!, But you don't need the book....","Granted, the book is pretty good. But why? All the information is readily available in the Flickr help, Flickr forums, or just performing a google search. Not to mention, by the time the book arrives, there will be newer methods/ techniques. I love Flickr, but the point is having your 'visuals' online- information on Flickr is more dynamic online too."
2,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:","NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH THIS MOVIE. IT IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. IKNOW THAT FULL NOON NIGHTS ARE LIKE. AND THE NIGHTS OF 13 NOONS ARE SUPPOSE TO BE OFF THE WALL. I BOUGHT THIS DVD AS IT HAD JENNIFER BEALS IN IT. THE DIRECTOR/PRODUCER (HER HUSBAND ALEX ROCKWELL) KEPT HER IN JAIL DURINF THE WHIOLE MOVIE. WHAT A DOWNER. IT YOU CAN'T COUNT ON YOUR HUSBAND TO HELP YOUR CARREER, WHO CAN YOU COUNT ON. JM"
3,Colbie Caillat dvd,"The sound quality is good, but the picture is poor. The last song ""Bubbly"" ends abruptly after it's about half way through. I bought the DVD used for 4 bucks. I'm guessing it's some kind of poorly made promo deal...Pete"
3,Not like mom's,Good but not great. Reminded me a little bit like mom's but a stronger citric acid taste. Expensive.
3,GET THE RUBBER BAND,"This toy is ok, once you take the rubber bands off and make him explode when you put him togeather he falls apart. If you throw the rubber band away he will never fight again, or stay togeather, so if you want a good Grivous buy the 4 lightsaber attack one."
2,Not a good grievous figure.,"I got this figure at wal mart,and I thought it would be great. I was wrong.When I took it out, it fell apart instintly.It is impossible to put back together.The exploding body doesn't work well.I'd reccomend this toy for leave in the package types."
3,Collector's Review,"Well, I love General G., and I was hoping to collect everything I could of him, the first thing being this figure. Like all the other reviews, I can say it immediately fall apart, even though I didn't even push the explode button. I simply ket the plastic it came in and was able to fit it together, get tyhe cloak on and fit it into the plastic. I would recomend keeping the plastic container or the little rubber strings to keep it together."
1,THIS IS A TOTAL PEICE OF CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this toy and all it does is fall apart when you put it together!!!!even when you take it out of the box!!!IF YOU GET THIS TOY YOU ARE A TOTAL MORON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Looks cool, plays like crap","My little brother bought this toy after saving up his money for a while. Its pretty dissapointing. He has fun playing with it, but he has to be really careful with it or it breaks. I can't believe they call this a children's toy. It isn't kid friendly at all. Not recommendable."
3,"A Little Tricky, But Still Fun!","I think that even though the General Grievous figure explodes, and that it's hard to put back together, I still think it's fun because if you carry it around the right way to hold it, it might just stay pretty good. I like it especially how it looks. It has a good touch to it. Sometimes, just let it stand for a while and eventually, it will get a little more stable. I think it's fun. Besides, be happy for what you have. I say you should buy this product! I think it's a little cooler because you know, the arms and head can come off too. I thought that was neat. Still, I like it because I have it and even though it's a little tricky, it's still fun!"
4,Grievous BLOWS YOUR MIND!,"General grievous has gotten a few figures with the new revenge of the sith movie. None of them are as fun as this one. Not to say it's the best by any means but this figure is pretty cool. This is #36 General grievous with exploding body. He imcludes a cool removable full obdy cloak and a blaster and lightsaber. Press the button on his butt and he explodes. Totally explodes. His arms,head and legs fly off. At the same time his body explodes and green guts fly out. This is a really fun, if somewhat sickening action feature. I reccommend this to anyone who likes Grievous as a character. Get it now!"
1,Not to be played with,"While many of these ""toys"" are obviously made for collectors not kids, which is disgraceful, this is the worst. My son could not wait to get it and drove me nuts. So we bought it, and literally after 3 minutes the pieces were in a plastic bag in his toy box and has never come out again. Save your money!"
2,"Messy, messy, messy...","Well, on the upside we've got a fine representation of how Grievous looks when kicking back aboard his starship. That's really about the end of the positive. This thing is total junk. The only way to keep it in one piece is to never remove the clear rubber band wrapped around his torso to keep him together in the package. Grievous was one of my favorite characters, and while the sculpt of this toy is nice, the action feature just completely wrecks it. High marks for educational value because it teaches kids that life is full of misery and disappointment!"
2,All The King's Horses and All The King's Men...,"...Couldn't put General Grievous back together again.I liked Star Wars III, and especially liked General Grievous. So When my kids saw the exploding Grievous figure, I thought, Sure, what the heck.The action figure looks very cool, but good luck putting the pieces of General Grievous back together again once you push that tempting little ""explode"" button.You might have some luck assembling him, but after two or three explosions, he'll never be same. The pieces just don't hold the same and tend to fall off at the slightest provocation.So if you like General Grievous, get it, but be aware of how delicate this action figure is. If anything, get it, and save it as a collectible."
1,My son cried!!!,"Please don't buy this for your child. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought one for my son. He was beyond excited when I gave it to him, but 5 minutes after he took it apart (the plastic band), he couldn't get it to stay back together. He was so disappointed he cried. I returned it today."
2,BOOOOOOOO!!!!,this toy sucks! all the falling apart and apart is sooo anoying! if you had 5$ and this was the only toy and the toy cost exactly 5$ DONT i repeat DONT get this toy!
1,If only they had a NO STAR rating,"This toy was great fun for the first explosion. He never went back together. Amazon should bundle this with super glue ""buy together and save."" My six year old hates this toy it is so frustrating. I did finally super glue it and now he can at least hold it without it falling apart."
1,toy terror,"ok, this toy has caused me a lot of trouble. first, when I try to move the lightsaber, his arm falls off, second, his legs don't even bend, and I don't recomend taking off the rubber band that holds him together, or general greivous wont' be the only one exploding!"
1,Dissapointing Toy,"I got this toy late last night and could hardly wait to play with it. The next day when I got home from school to try it out, and it was a very frustrating experience. Grievious has a exploding button on his back, but I don't think it is necessary.He will fall apart if you move him. I spent one hour trying to keep him together using rubberbands, tape, etc. As soon as I get a chance, Grievious is going back to the store. I'll try out the four-armed figure instead."
3,Warning! Don't Buy This Toy!!!!!,"This thing SUCKS! End of discusion. To put it simply it just ""explodedes"" at the slightest touch! Take my word for it and buy the four armed version instead!"
2,Marton disappoints!,"This opera stands or falls by the title role. Unfortunately, Eva Marton is disappointing here, her voice wobbly and hoarse. She's unable to do justice to the requirements of Strauss vocal writing for this complex part. In the role of Chrysothemis, Studer is here caught before her decline. Do expect some good singing, then. Fassbaender is a good Klytemnestra, but she can't rival her more authoritative predecessors in the role. The VPO plays well, but Abbado's conducting is only ordinary."
2,Very Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book. While the author meant well, the book is very poorly written, and its message unclear. It seemed as though the author did not have a firm grasp of the subject. ""A Very Short Introduction"" was hardly an introduction at all. The book took major detours into advanced (advanced for me) subject matter that I wondered if the author himself understood. I'm probably more confused now about architecture than I was before reading the book. I did not complete the book. I got half way through it and simply could not endure any more. Unfortunately for me, I did not heed some of the bad reviews for this book. I will not be so careless next time. Fortunately, there are far better books available."
4,great shower gift,"If you're looking for a book with lots of short, easy stories this is it. I was suprised, however, that there were some stories I had not heard of. I wanted all of the classics and I'm not sure they were all there, but the recipient really loved the book."
4,You need this,"Good monitor for the price... no, it's a GREAT monitor for the price. Don't be fooled by the name, it's sounds more like a hair replacement company for men. This Euro made baby ""will pump up you girly man"" on res and brightness. I'd give it 5 stars if not for the speakers. Budget for external speakers unless you like that AM thing, what that?."
4,Aisics for heavy guys,"These a great shoes if you are over 200 lbs. They give nice cusion and support, and the 4E's are nice if you need them. I ran a marathon in the rain and found out that 4E is too wide for me."
3,Not for me,I'm a 4E heavy runner and an overpronator who just was not happy with the comfort of this shoe. Asics are my absolute favorite running shoe but the Foundation 7 just lacked the comfort I expect from Asics.
5,Being a Doctor is hard,"I almost didn't buy this game since it just sounded weird, but I did buy it. It is weird. It is also very fun to figure out the what to do and keep up the pace so you didn't kill people. The operations are really great, don't worry it doesn't really look like the inside of a body at all. There are two detracting points to this game. One, the art just isn't that good, this may be a blessing as it would be pretty gross otherwise. Two, there is two much talking and down time between operations. The operations are really fun and interesting, but then you have to get back to the story. The story was pretty boring to me as you don't get to make any choices you just read it. Overall, I really like this game, at least the operations, you can speed up the talking so you don't actually have to read. Only the most squimish will have a problem with it."
2,You Have to be Fast,"Speed is more important than precision in Trauma Center: Under the Knife. It's not a game I want my surgeon to play. We thought the game was fun for awhile, then the speed and skill level required became overwhelming. The soap opera story line was more irritating than inspiring. Unless you are a really good gamer, the diagnosis for this one is terminal."
3,What was i thinking!!!!!!!!,ok im the kid who reviewed on the 13 of feb. at that time i loved this game. not saying it is bad just saying that it does get repeditive. i put this down last week and have no rush to play again! the deep story line gets shallow by the 10 operation this is an ok game and will not dissapoint at a low price. all it is you may ask is talking about your physicodic german assistant who thinks that thinks of you as hitler to jews and african americans. but she may love you in the next mission and hate you the next.
1,Extremely frustrating!,"Without a doubt one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, and not in a ""fun and challenging"" way... Just annoying. I played this for about an hour and then gave up entirely."
4,Fun But Impossible!,"This game is fun for the first 10 challenges. Then, it is pretty much impossible. I have had this game for two years, and I am still stuck on the level where you have to rescue 5 patients in 10 minutes. It is impossible! I hope that if they re-make the game that they make it simpler."
4,Under the Knife,So much fun for my 15 year old who wants to be a surgeon. And tons of fun for her friends who have no interest in medicine.It was a great surprise present and she's played it over and over.
2,Too Difficult,"I enjoy a challenge, but this game it way too hard. It's not fun to fail a mission more than tens times. Plus when you fail it offers you a chance to retry but you still have to go through all the talking again.(which is ANNOYING & BORING)This game could have been fun, but it's too hard. The patients vitals drop way too quickly. And there's pretty much only 1 way to do each mission. I had to look at a walk through to get through every other mission. There were a couple of times I wanted to snap the frickin' DS in half. (Of course I didn't)I'm just really glad I didn't buy this game."
2,"Hand cramping, stressful frenzy of a game, not that there's anything wrong with that.","I've played probably 20 different Nintendo DS games to the finish and I have to say this is the most frustrating game I've ever played. I love the early missions and the creativity is awesome, but the controls are kinda blah. Several times you'll find yourself redrawing the zoom, over & over & over as your patient (& patience) dies. Redrawing stitches over & over gets tedious fast. The game has good intentions, but unlike most games that I just couldn't put down, this one I have to put down to release tension both in my hands and in my mind. I am looking forward to seeing the improvements in the upcoming release."
5,"A very HARD game, but a surgeon's life is never easy.","I'll keep this short. Trauma Center is a unique game, and it is indeed really fun. The only caveat is that it is not easy. Even the first few operations will make you tear your hair in frustration. But it is worth it. The rewarding sensation you get when you beat each mission is not to be forgotten."
