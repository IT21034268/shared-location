1,No WAY!!!,"I wish there was some way to rate it LOWER than 1. In reality it is a MINUS 100!!This is a horrendously insulting attempt to, once AGAIN, treat all those love Lord of the Rings like Lemmings marching blindly to the sea. To include ONLY the theatrical version is nothing short of highway robbery. They have ALREADY put both the extended and theatrical versions on several releases including the ones with the Costa Botes extras. To offer us only the theatrical version on the first bluray release with only vague hints about when the extended versions will be made available is totally unacceptable.This is a contemptible attempt on their part to take advantage of the people who have ALREADY shelled out millions of dollars to support this franchise. As much as I love Tolkien's work... I will NOT support this flagrant rip off. Talk about double-dipping... AGAIN! Didn't we already DO this once??Do NOT buy this product!!"
1,90 Bucks for this? Really?,"I am amazed at the cost of this set, I own the 3 extended editions for DVD, I wanted to buy the regular edition and blu-ray seemed like the way to go, I almost buyed this set, but It came to my attention that the theatrical release of these movie were sold as singles for 7 bucks a piece in November of this year (on the black friday week)! this set is a rip-off!"
1,deal with known companies,"I order box set DVD and it did not come in case set, instead single DVDs (3) try to get a refund they do not give refunds back, so will not purchase from them again. Plus took forever to receive!!!!!"
1,Same all over again,"This also reminds me of King Kong on Blu Ray, have we even got the extended versions of them yet on HD ? Although with this movie the loss of that extra hour makes us miss some truly heart felt scenes.Such as the scene in The two towers when Aragorn reveals how old he is while pretending to like that broth.Its like buying a box of choccies and finding you've only got 6 of 12 types in the box. How can you bring yourself to watch a movie that offers you half of what you got before ?Ok in the cinema it was ok because after 4 hours of sitting in a small seat you would be dying for the toilet ! That is unless the UK bring back the interval and stop making cattlesheds to watch movies in.Never been to the cinema for years because half the time the screen looks aweful (yes one time it even had a hole in the screen !!)Anyway to sum up WAIT for the extended versions"
1,"Yes, it's a ripoff",I totally agree with the first anti-review. Another example of studio ripoffs. Give them no business until they release the extended versions (at least) and tell them in your review that you want both versions on one set.
1,AMAZON PLEASE DO NOT SELL THIS !!!,"LOTR FANS AROUND THE WORLD, DO NOT BUY THIS THEATRICAL EDITIONS.Die hard LOTR fans should have been watched both theatrical and extended version already. And you all know which one is better one.SKIP THIS VERSION, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!Check the review rating and 2000 buyers all say no to this version.Believe me, within months after this, WB and New Line Cinema will release the Theatrical Editions with special packaging (Gollum booble head, Minas tirit miniature, etc) to depleted this version stocks.Then after they suck most of our hard earn money, they will release the Extended version in their third wave to totally drop us poorer and make them richer for movie that made them rich already.I will go with the other 2000 users, no Theatrical Editions impulsive buying for me.Sorry WB, New Line Cinema and Peter Jackson,.. you got great product here but don't push us LOTR fans too much in this bad economic."
1,Unscrupulous Marketing Gimmick,"The slated release date for the EXTENDED version is 2010 or 2011 (as cited by studio in 2009). This release therefore is, like the DVD release before it, a total and complete rip off. If you just LOOOOoooove the theatrical release - great. Pay your money and sit down secure in the knowledge you have pressed the feeder button firmly. Enjoy your pellet. For those who admire and are gum-smackingly appreciative of the extended edition, this token release (pun?) is to see if your desire for extra resolution is greater than your desire for a better value (extended release).Choose well."
1,THANKS LET ME KEEP PAYING FOR THIS OVER AND OVER,"Lord of the Rings is a great series of movies, that being said New Line Cinema is one of the worst companies that ever existed in the history of humanity. For pulling this same scam over and over and over and over their upper management should be jailed and beaten daily, their houses should be raised, and their children should be sold into slavery. Then and only then would we all understand the true meaning of Christmas. Thoughts?"
1,Say NO to double dipping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just wanted to add the impressive list of bad reviews. Maybe some day they will start listening to the people who support their products. Double dipping worked with DVD because it was a brand-new, evolving format so at that time, you could get away with selling us ""special edition"" ""super-special edition"" ""directors cut"" ""the definitive special edition"" and so on. Well now people are much more technologically savvy. We know what we want, and we know what you're trying to do. We WILL NOT pay 2, 3, 4 times for the SAME MOVIES ANYMORE!!!!!! BOYCOTT DOUBLE DIPPING!!!!!!"
3,both versions together please...,please new line give us both together or i will be waiting for the extendeds only .... i will not give you money for them twice as i did for the original DVD releases (i too also ended up giving away the first releases.) got me once not happening again!
1,Also waiting for the extended version.,I've already purchased the theatrical version as well as the extended version on DVD. I am not to going to buy both versions on BluRay as well. So I am also going to wait for the extended version to come out on BluRay.
1,Lord of the Rings,"Never received product. I guess the merchant went out of business, but not before they took my money. Thank goodness Amazon made it right, and I received a refund."
2,A lesson on corporate greed...,"I agree with all my fellow reviewers that this is a travesty! It is generally accepted among LOTR fans that the Extended versions are Peter Jackson's COMPLETE vision for this beloved trilogy and are superior to the theatrical versions. By not offering the longer versions on Blu-ray format (that can finally handle the capacity with ease) is just wrong. I would be willing pay more for the extended if it were being offered, but I refuse to purchase the same thing twice. BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE - Let's all wait for Warner Bros/New Line to DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE CONSUMER!"
1,Pure Greed,"Why would they even do this to us? Pure greed. In today's dvd/blu-ray loving society, with ALL of the extras that now come on dvds, there is simply no excuse for not releasing the extended versions at the same time. More to the point, the studios could have EASILY put both versions on the same set if they were worried that such a large sect of the fanbase, for some unknown reason, would NOT WANT the extended versions. I have many movies on dvd that offer a ""theatrical version"" and an ""uncut"" version, and with the legions of fans that support this franchise, it's truly a slap in the face to make us wait. I have not bought this product and will not buy any Lord of the Rings on blu ray until they release the extended versions. Which sucks, because I love these movies and really would like to own a hi-def copy, but I guess in the meantime I'll just watch them on TNT when they do LOTR weekends."
1,Not extended version,We won't be fooled again. Simply wait for the extended version to be released. Don't waste your money on this version.
1,No way!,"Just to join the claim. There's no chance in the world I'll spend money in this edition of the movies. Not even being a huge fan justifies it. If we as consumers don't protest, companies will keep pulling the strings and soaking money out of us. ( wonder what will happen with Star Wars in blu-ray...)"
1,Trying to make us Double Dip again...,"I'm just adding my 2 cents also. I can't believe they are trying to do the same thing so many people complained about with the DVD versions.. Please nobody buy this theatrical edition! Everyone should wait for the extended cut which is confirmed for blu-ray release already also, so it's obvious what they are tryin to do, make everyone waste money on them and in THIS ECONOMY? bad idea New Line.."
1,Wait for Extended!,Do not buy this product. Wait for the Extended Versions. They are so much better(though the originals are great). I can wait.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BLU RAY!,"Another attempt for the studios to make money, and rip off the customer with this ""Theatrical Version"", and then re-releasing the ""Extended Version"" later. Buyer Beware!"
1,"Don't pay, just wait for extended version!","It's incredible, but in the end all comes to money. The extended version is there, they just don't want to release it until everybody has payed for the theatrical regular version and then make them pay again for the extended version. DON'T BUY THIS THING! Wait a little for the extended version on BluRay."
1,Imagine what it COULD HAVE BEEN,"An inferior product carefully designed TO BE inferior. Please don't encourage the release of more inferior products by making this purchase. I want to see these films at 1080p just as much as the next person, but this dubious marketing tactic has got to stop. Holding out for the Extended Editions."
1,l hate being dry.....,"l dont own this and based on the greed pointed out by other reviewers, don't plan to own this. l concur with you fellas, put both versions on one set o blu rays. Snowtrooper out."
1,Listen to the fans,"At the very least, release the extended versions at the same time! Don't insult our intelligence"
1,What the...,"Really? REALLY??? The theatrical versions? and on NINE Disks? Given the size of Blu-Ray disks, WHAT is in these disks??? And, again, the theatrical versions???Yes, I'm a LotR fanatic. Yes I have the books in Greek AND in English, yes I have the animated Fellowship, yes I've bought the extended DVDs, with and without the statues, yes I've bought LotR RISK, yes I've bought LotR Monopoly, yes I've bought LotR miniatures, yes I've bought three different versions of the One ring. But NO, I will not take part in this very bad joke. I'll just wait until the extended version Blu-Rays. And since I hear it will take one or two years for them to come out, I'll expect these Blu-Rays to be SO full of stuff, I'll need two lifetimes to see them all.Cheerio everyoneJohnPS. The theatrical versions??????"
1,Why make us wait?,"Also voting here to boycott this release. LOTR fans are loyal and numerous and we deserve to have the theatrical and extended cuts in the same Blueray package. Why make us wait or waste our money when both should be provided. We flocked to the theaters and purchased theatrical and then extended versions on regular DVD. Where is our reward? This is by far the greatest epic trilogy ever made. I have been wanting to own them in Blueray, but now I guess I will have to wait for the marketing geniuses to decide when it is safe to release the extended cuts in Blueray!!!"
1,"Fool Me Once, You Got Me. Fool Me Twice...",I refuse to waste my money again on a DVD set based on only the theatrical releases. Blu-Rays are expensive enough without New Line screwing over Lord of the Rings fans this way AGAIN. Save your money - wait for the extended version release of Lord of the Rings which you KNOW is coming.
1,Greedy-Greedy-Greedy,"Yeah I know we enjoy the benefits of a free market system, but come on,we're in recession. Not everyone can afford to drop [...]bucks on the theatrical version and then do the same when the EE's come out. I willwait until the extended cuts are out and boycott the theatrical's."
1,TLOTR - Motion Picture Robbery,"O'right, can't wait to buy this Bluray trilogy set to go along with the 3 theatrical and 3 extended DVD's that I purchased before. Heck yeah, you bet I'm also gonna buy the Bluray extended version when it comes out. Hey, you a salesman? Come by my place today and I'll buy two of whatever you're selling. I think I also have 3 of those lying around.New Line's Motto: ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka""."
1,BLUE RAY COMPARISON VERSUS EXTENDED VERSION,"I already bought this movie twice like everyone else and so I did not want to buy the whole trilogy movie the third time. Just to see the quality between the extended and blue ray edition, I bought The Return of the King and found the quality is equally the same. The Blue Ray version is not of the same high quality as other recent new Blue Ray movies lets say like Avatar. MY ADVICE IS DONT BUY THE BLUE RAY TRILOGY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE EXTENDED VERSION. EVEN MY SON WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Great movies... Horrible Blu-Ray Product,"The movies are great, the audio is great, but the PQ isn't that great. I hope the extended editions fix this."
1,Hollywood is milking us again,"I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already. This is just another example of corporate Hollywood trying to take as much of our money as they can by releasing twelve versions of these movies spaced apart as far as possible. If we want this practice to stop, we need to actually do something about it. If you want the extended versions of these movies on Blu Ray, don't buy this to simply ""tide you over"" until the eventual release. Because, let's face it: THE EXTENDED VERSIONS WILL COME, WHETHER OR NOT YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS VERSION!!! Watch your extended versions on DVD until the version that you actually want is released. If everyone buys this version while continuing to complain that it's theatrical, the corporate bigwigs won't learn anything and will continue to feed us this bare-minimum BS and milk us for every dime of our money that they can."
1,How Greedy!,"How greedy can New Line Cinemas be?? They fooled us with the first release on DVD! We loved it when it came out, until they released the Extended version; then we HAD to have it as well! Now they're pulling the same trick on Bluray! Shame on you, New Line Cinemas!! Do not buy this bluray if you're a true fan of Lord of the Rings!!!"
1,Pointless money grab,"Not going with Blu-Ray until it has both the theatrical and extended versions together. Fool me once, shame on you..."
5,CVO,"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)Absolutely Fabulous! If you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings, this is a must have for your collection."
5,Platinum Edition of The Lord of the Rings,"For those of you who are The Lord of the Rings fans, the Platinum Edition gives more details that had been deleted from the original release of these movies. It is worth getting this edition."
5,Great box set.,Unless you already own all three movies and got them when the first came out on Platinum Series then this is a great box set to own. Six of the discs have the movies on them. The other six discs are the extras. And there is a lot of them. So if you already own the Platinum Series or have thought about it think no more. Get the box set and get all three movies.If your not much into the extras and all the added scenes then the next best thing is the normal Motion Picture box set.
1,DISC REGION INCORECT,"This is a real shame!!!NO ONE disc is working, the box I received have 7 scars!I will retourn back to Amazon my order and ask my money back!!"
1,"I've been waiting for LotR on Blu Ray, and they messed this up royally.","I've been waiting for LotR on Blu Ray, and they messed this up royally. No extended editions? Really? I won't fall for it. Sorry, big media execs. I'll be watching LotR through ""alternative measures"", if you catch my drift, since you messed this up so bad."
1,I agree with the others,"I don't even do reviews, but for this I found it necessary. I may not want to sit through the extended versions or I may. I currently own the extended DVD box set. I have been looking forward to the BD release. I was sure with the BD disc size both theatrical and extended would be included. Many say they are waiting for the Extended BD set before buying, personally I will only buy if the BD discs have both versions, unless someone can tell me why both versions cannot be included in one BD set."
1,what BS...,"I will never waste my money on a set that doesn't include the extended versions. This set should already be including them. I really hope this set flops so they realize what a mistake it was to bend over all the clamoring fans who should expect EE on bluray.The worst part is that when they do finally release the EEs on bluray, they're going to be more expensive than this set, no doubt!"
1,Really...?,"While I know I shouldn't be, I'm amazed that NLC is making this move. Rather than just put out the extended edition that they know folks want, they pull this move. It would have made more sense to me to release the extended edition as a package and the theatrical release per movie. This way, they can upcharge on the extended and provide standard BR pricing in the theatrical and everyone's happy. But no, they get greedy and the sad thing is there are tons of people who will buy this release. Well, I won't be among them no matter how much I love these films.Jerks."
1,Wow - Isn't this Getting Old?,"We all know the game by now. First release a basic version then, oh I don't know, by the holidays, release the loaded version. This is really really sad and greedy on their part.Do not buy this. The extended versions are awesome."
1,"Don't buy this rip-off, wait for the Extended Version","Whoa, close one! I almost hit the purchase button, then saw this was the *theatrical releas*. What a bunch of B.S! New Line pulled a big rip-off the first time when they release the theatrical version, then just a few weeks later, after everyone bought it, released the Extended Version. Don't be fooled twice by this greedy ploy by New Line. May they suffer a total loss of profit on printing this fiasco of a BluRay. Like many reviewers above, they could EASILY fit both the theatrical and Extended Editions on one disk, or at most two, just like the DVD version."
1,"Its up to you, but im waiting","Like most people im going to wait for the extended edition, i did buy both versions when they came out on DVD, i ended up giving the theatrical editions to a freind. The excuse then was, i want to see the movies now. I dont need to do that with the Blu-ray's, i have the extended editons on DVD.Hoping that some poor (wife,husband,mother, father) purchases this edition thinking they are getting the best blu-ray LOTR is pretty sleazy!!!"
1,Lord of the Rings Blue Ray,Very dissapointed that this is not the extended version. I almost pulled the trigger. DONT GET SCREWED BY WARNER BROTHERS again.
1,Waiting for the extended edition,"LOTR is a great movie, but I see no point in buying this short edition of it while I already own the extended edition on DVD. Only the release of the extended edition on Blu-ray will make me spend money once more."
1,Wait for the Extended Version,"I have the DVD version Extended Edition. Bought both the version since nobody knew about the Extended. Now they only choose to release the Theatrical and of course, everyone will wait for the Extended. Only rich people will buy both but regular people such as most of the reviewers here will wait and the Production company will have us wait so that they sell these to suckers."
1,Upscale to 1080P and wait for the extended version,"Like most others, I suggest _waiting for the Blu-Ray extended version_ and forget this feeble attempt to grab a ""few dollars more"" with the standard version on Blu-Ray. The extended version is far better as most who presently own it can attest - and if you use an HDMI interface and a proper DVD player / amp combo you can ""upscale"" the current standard DVD format extended version to 1080P in the interim -- or (like they hope) buy it again when the extended comes out - your choice:("
1,New Line is saying BOHICA. Bend over here it comes again!!!,"as everyone has said, this is a bad attemt to get even more money out of us. I would pay a little more if both versions were in there. Do not buy this version!!!!!!Wait for extended cut."
1,Outrageous!,I agree completely with others here: with the capacity of BluRay there is NO EXCUSE not to offer both the theatrical and extended versions. I will NOT buy until this is done.
1,This isn't worth the money,"I agree with the other reviews. Films that come out in blu-ray that we've already bought on dvd should have something extra or special about them. Otherwise there's no point in spending extra money, cause you're buying the same thing. After knowing that the extended cuts exist, why would we want to buy the theatrical versions?I also heard they're making The Hobbit. Will they release 2 dvd and 2 blu ray versions of that one too? Then another version that's packaged with the LOTR movies?Don't buy this...watch your dvd's that are upscanned on your blu ray player for now. When something worth it comes out, we'll buy!"
2,Not what I expected,"To be quite honest...I was disappointed. I ordered what was to be: The Lord of the Rings-The Motion Picture Triogy. (widescreen edition) As pictured in the ad for purchase, the movies were to be a box set. That is NOT what I recieved. Instead I recieved 3 separate movies. Since this was a specific gift request, imagine my surprise when the recipient informed me it was not the box set. Yes he kept the movies, because he did not have them, but the disappointment was still there.Since I now know that this particular supplier does not properly fill orders, I will be very hesitant about ordering in the future. I truly feel that the supplier falsely advertised the goods."
1,Lord Of The Rings-Blu Ray Rip Off,"I Agree With Everyone Here. I Bought The Standard And Special Extended Editions Of All Three Movies And Will Not Be Duped Into Buying These Blu Ray Versions.Its A Case Of The Studios ""Double Dipping"" And True Fans Of The Trilogy Will Not Take This Crap Anymore.Does Peter Jackson Not Have A Say In The Production Of The Blu Ray Versions Of His Beloved Films Or Are The Studios Taking Us For A Bunch Of Saps?Come On New Line Cinema,Give The Fans What They Deserve.The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]"
1,"Not worth it, do not buy it!","What is the mean buy a blu-ray with Theatrical Editions, I mean, who wanna a Theatrical one if already have the extended edition in the market before, wait the extended one show up on blu-ray, this one is crap!"
1,Not gonna bother buying this,"""As the title reads, I am not going to waist my money on this rip off. I am a huge lover of Tolkien's amazing trilogy: The Lord Of The Rings, and I think that the movies were also amazing; the best movies out there (though, of course, nothing can come close to those books. Nothing, not even feature films and spectacular special effects can beat the Human imagination). But I agree with all the other reviews saying ""Give us the extended editions on Blu-ray!"". My family does have the extended versions, and the theatrical versions: and, frankly, the extended versions are way better. These movies deserve Blu-ray versions more than any other movie! So I end this review, saying: COME ON, NEW LINE! HURRY UP!!"""
4,No problems and good service,The Lord of the Rings came within the time specified. The product was intact and in the condition advertised. I am satisfied with the service and would use them again.
1,Blu-Ray Schmoo-Ray,"I agree with all of the above. We all know that BluRay has the storage capacity to carry the extended versions of these films. Why not make them like the Blade Runner and Close Encounters discs and make them so you can compare the differing versions? Why make us wait? The fans of LOTR want the extended, because those are the only TRUE versions.Join the cause!Fight for the release we want.One star or nothing!"
1,"I take that back, no stars for you.","Boo! Shame on you Blu-ray and New Line Cinema. Shame, shame. Fool me not again."
3,Ojo!,"Ojo si compran esta versión, solo viene con subtitulos en frances e ingles. No en castellano como dice el aviso. Igualmente si mas o menos entienden inglés se ven perfectamente."
1,No on the Theatrical Editions,I'm not even going to consider renting the theatrical edition. Bring out the extended versions and quit cheating the consumer.
1,Waiting for the Theatrical AND Extended versions,"I absolutely agree with so many who have reviewed here. The movies are a 5+ for sure. However, I'll not buy anything on Blu-Ray until the extended versions are available along with the theatrical versions. And yes, they will fit on the disc. As soon as they are produced, I'll be one of the first to purchase all 3 films on BR."
1,"Not being fooled again. no extended version, no want.","This is the same garbage they did with the DVD. Of course, like a fool I purchased both the standard DVD and then the Extended DVD.I will not be committing the same mistake twice. Although I can't wait to see this film on BluRay, I will hold back and wait for the extended edition. The studios are aiming to double dip once again with this movie. Not gonna happen.Stay away from purchasing this edition and wait for the Extended Blu-Ray."
1,Vote no so we can get the extended edition,Just echoing the call to get Warner to stop trying to rip us off with multiple releases. Just give us a theatrical/extended special edition.
1,My one ring is feeling a little tore up,"After making us wait for years they are gonna pull the two version trick on us again. Are these guys really that stupid? This is a very brazen move after independants are seeing the hole growing between LOTR and the Hobbit. Who needs the big guys anymore. Like the music companies, they will soon go the way of the DoDo.I will never buy another Warner Bros, New Line, or LOTR product again. I am tired of being treated like an idiot by idiots."
1,Why?,What is the point of Theatrical only without even a release date for Extended if not to try to get people to buy twice?I won't do it. I've waited this long for Extended on Blu-ray. I can wait a little longer.
1,Not falling for this,"I'm not falling for this. I want the extended and the extended editions only. It's insulting to try and make fans double dip after 3 separate DVD releases of each film. This should have been a box set with seamless branching between extended and theatrical plus all of the special features from all 3 previous DVD editions.Anything less is an insult, and I won't support it."
1,Big Disappointment,"Blu-Ray... Yay!Theatrical release without the Extended version? Stupid.I highly recommend every customer simply enjoy their extended-cut DVDs for another year, then buy JUST the extended blu-ray edition when it is released.Wish I could choose LESS than one star, for this release certainly deserves it."
1,Wait for it....,Ditto's to all above. Wait for BD Extended sets; tell New Line (with your wallet) to stop screwing the fans over!
1,I agree!,No more money wasted on theatrical cuts! Like many others I have already purchased both cuts on DVD. How much more money are we supposed to shell out on LOTR? I'm waiting for the extended cut to come out this time around.
5,At least they're upfront this time!,"At least we're getting the skinny upfront this time. Still remember buying the first LOTR only to see the preview of ""COMING SOON: EXTENDED EDITION"". Clever marketing but what a bugger!Still it's odd that King Kong came out in the double (theatrical and extended) but Peter doesn't want to offer the same option for LOTR trilogy!! Odd!"
1,Disappointed,"I`m a big Lord of The Rings fan,i was waiting for the Lord Of The Rings Blu Ray realese, but i was very disappointed when i started to watch the movie...first of all, when you watching a Blue Ray you expect 1080p resolution,but this one is not much better then a DVD quality, the sound is ok,but the picture quality is rubbish, we spend a fortune to buy 1080p tellys, ps3 or blu ray players,and you pay for the trilogy wich is not even blu ray quality and is not even the extended version,i heard that in june 28 this year the extended version is comming out,but only the Fellowship of the Ring will be restoreted,so every year they gonna realese one restoreted part??????????is gonna cost us a fortune,this is not fair,shame on them is such a fantastic movie, and they ruin everything with the Blu Ray realese..."
1,"Again, release extended version!","As many other reviewers said, buying the theatrical release after owning the extended version in DVD is not worth it..."
1,Bummed beyond words,"I couldn't have been more excited to hear that LOTR was being re-re-re-released...this time on Blu-Ray. That was, of course, until I learned that it was the theatrical version, and not the extended editions. I've already purchased The Fellowship of the Ring 3 times. Once when it first came out on DVD (theatrical version) then when the extended edition came out. Then yet again when the Special Edition set came out with all 3 movies.I hope no one buys this set and that if you already have, that you return it, demand a refund and hold out for the Extended Edition Blu-Ray set which is sure to come out later.Shame on you [insert responsible party here]!"
1,Won't Get Fooled Again!,"I am a huge fan of the LOTR having read the trilogy five times. My wife and I watch the extended cuts of the movies at least twice a year. Do not fall victim to yet another exercise in corporate greed and purchase a blue-ray of the theatrical release. You will be sorry! Men of the West, today we fight!"
1,don't be jerks,"pull this release and put away your piggy little fantasies of milking the public for every last cent.Most fans who will buy this have already bought the dvd releases, respect them (me) and release a product that we want. Based on these reviews it looks like you can only count on the impulse buyers walking past the display to buy this one. Boo!"
1,Why no Extended Version?,"Why isn't there an Extended Blu Ray version? Silly that there is a Standard definition DVD version of both releases, but only one for Blu Ray. Think the publishers are trying to get people to buy the same movie 4 times? Hm...Do not buy."
1,Extended misery,Title says it all. Don't buy the theatrical version and wait for the extended edition! If you're going to pay the extra bucks to watch it on blu ray watch the real deal.
1,Release the EE version with the normal,"This is just another attempt at studios trying to get us to double dip.Seamless branching is available and has been used on previous Blu-ray movies, why should this be any different?Include the EE with the TE!"
1,I think I have to go with the majority on this one...,"What are they thinking? Oh, that's right: they're thinking they want to continue to fleece their customers. Thanks, but I'll wait for the extended versions."
1,Price gouging! :- (,As an NZer I am ashamed that PJ and New Line are not including the extending cuts on this release. I absolutely loved these films but there is no way I will buy this set!
1,Where is the extended versions?,I agree with the majority of those giving reviews. Don't buy this version and wait for the extended versions. New Line should have put both in the same package. They are just trying to make more money off the fans.
1,Newline Ripoff Technique!,"Just as they did with the DVD, they release the Theatrical Edition a few months before announcing the Extended Edition to rip off unsuspecting customers into purchasing both. Just like over 95% of all other reviewers on this product said, do NOT buy and get ripped off! Wait for the Extended edition, and make sure you don't get ripped off in the price either."
1,WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!,"Do not throw good money into this inferior product.Wait for the extended version.The fewer people who buy this, the sooner they will release the extended version."
1,"Don't buy this version, wait until they release the real version.","There is no reason to buy the ""non-extended"" version presented here. They've already done the work, they can just give us the extended version. There's no reason to cave and buy this version when they're just going to release the extended version months later, asking you to rebuy the movies possibly a fourth time. Just, don't throw your money away for goodness sakes."
1,Just adding my voice to the disgruntled list of fans,I just want to help lower the rating. There's no justifiable reason to not have the extended versions released at the same time as the theatrical versions.
1,Won't purchase until extended is released!,Don't waste your money wait for the extended version. The movies are a 5 the release is a 1!
1,I waited on DVD and I'll wait again for the Extended Blu-Rays!,"When LOTR theatrical DVDs were released I read an article online about the extended Book editions coming 3-5 months later and I waited for those AND I told people at Best Buy etc. in line to reconsider their purchases.It is simply a JOKE they are doing this again, with ""the power of Blu-Ray"" how hard is it to put out ONE version and allow the viewer to decide between theatrical & extended cuts???IF ANYBODY BUYS THIS YOU ARE TELLING THEM YOU ARE A[...].This should sell ZERO copies :-(Noah"
1,Adding my vote to boycott this edition,"I would actually be fine with New Line releasing this theatrical version of the trilogy. However, the fact they're purposely holding back on the extended edition is why I'm casting a 1/5 rating here.While they may get some people who don't know what they're buying get this edition, they will sure not repurchase it again once extended cuts come out because they don't care which edition is which in the first place. As for the fans, we'll rather watch extended editions on DVD rather than watching theatrical cuts on Blu-ray."
1,Is New Line run by George Lucas?,This seems like a Lucas type move. Did I miss the news where he bought New Line?
1,Shame on You,"Greed. Why publish a blu ray with threatrical versions only? Greed. Because they should be either the extended only, or of course, BOTH on a blu ray. You didn't make enough yet? Shame on you. We will wait for the extended."
1,Evil Corporations,"Trying to shaft you out of $80 for the DVDs, $80 for the extended DVDs, $80 for the blu rays and then what is it, $80 for the extended blu rays?After all, you only wanted the extended editions and you clearly want blu ray over DVD. Why should it cost you some $400 just to get 3 movies?Blame corporate america. Biggest recession we've had in many of our lives and they're trying to squeeze every last drop of blood out of you. Just vile and pathetic.You know what, Evil Inc.? I'm not buying any of your products. Not this. Not the extended. I can wait until you go out of business and the license is taken over by some other company. Yes, they'll be evil as well as it seems to be some sort of parastitic infestation amongst you money grubbers, but atleast it won't be YOU that sees my money.Good luck asshats."
1,Wait for the Extended release,"I'll wait for the Extended version, and you should too. Don't pay for the same films twice."
1,Straight from Mordor,"How can a man who made a epic movie triumph about good vs. evil, be so evil? Is Peter Jackson Sauron?I am thrilled to see the level of rebellion on here. What is really obnoxious is that they could release a version that played either the Theater version or the extended version.Won't get fooled again. In fact, until Mr. Jackson apologizes for the original rip-off and this attempted robbery, then lowers the price on the Blu-Ray version to $20, I won't buy it."
1,Won't get duped again,Just doing my part. Won't buy the blu ray until the extended version is included. PASS THE WORD!!!!!
1,please offer the extended!,I was dupped with the original DVDs. I would like to buy the blu-ray but wont because its not the extended version. while it is still a good movie. please offer the extended.
1,Bad Business in a Bad Economy is still Bad Business,"Although Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth is nothing short of astounding I'm forced to agree that it's simply a bad idea for the studio to release the theatrical versions when both versions could have been released on roughly 3 Blu Ray disks. I sincerely hope that the Extended Editions will be packed with a plethora of features, which I'm sure will be. It's a no brainer that the fans..WONT BE FOOLED AGAIN! Give it til Christmas, the Extended Editions will be available in Blu Ray...DROOL... til then, rent it on Netflix.Movie: 5 stars doesn't cover itGetting ripped off: definitely 1 star..too bad there's no 0."
1,They must think we are in Prision...,"Cause they are trying to bend us over with this release.. its not the extended edition. They already have plans to re-release the extended edition on blu ray in roughly 4-5 months after regular blu ray sales drop. They claim the guy cant work on it atm but.. as others have said before me.. they already have it. All they have to do is simply load the images at the factory and start production....but someone out there is trying to milk us like prized cows...or old heifers. well you can tug at my lower extremities all you want studio ex's ... Its not milk money your gonna get blown over your face. Already have teh dvd extended editions here..will wait for it on blu ray around...November.. or December..whichever one you guys chose to be the ""Christmas rush"" release... then i'll wait till mid January when you slash $15 of the price .... .gotta love knowing marketing strats..makes the kool stuff so much cheaper to get :Pthis time its YOUR turn to bend over."
1,Dont Buy until both editions are released.,Like everyone else's opinion. This movie should be released at the same time as the extended edition and they should not make us wait any longer. Please dont purchase until both versions are released.
1,What a RIPOFF,"This is just a ripoff. Why not put the extended version out right away?I love the movies, I even like the theatrical version better (though I admit the extended one has it's advantages), but why not give me the choice? It worked with the DVD's for those who didn't know that an extended version was comming, but we won't let it happen again!"
1,Waiting For Extended Version!!!!!,I absolutely will not pay for the theatrical version!!!!! The extended version should be packaged with the theater version. This is such a MONEY GRAB and INSULT by the studio!!!!
1,Wait for the extended,We all waited too long for blu-ray of this. I'm waiting on the extended version.
1,Give me the extended Version,"We the fans, especially the original JRR Tolkien fans, are responsible for the huge success of these movies. Throw us a friggin' bone and give us the extended edition. I won't buy the theatrical version. I have the money, but I don't need 4 versions of these movies."
1,Why are you making us wait for extended version on blu ray? Rip-off!!,"New Line is ripping us off by withholding the extended version, and for no apparent reason other than to sell us the same movie again. I own and love the extended version for all 3 movies on DVD. The movies are awesome, but this sales practice from New Line is despicable."
1,They think we are cash cows?,"What a blatant ripoff! The movies do indeed deserve 5 stars, but the Product does NOT. I have bought all the DVD versions, but I wont be fooled twice!I would not be suprised if they pulled this crap with the upcoming Hobbit as well.Capitalism at it's best:("
1,What a scam!,I'm so irritated that they are releasing the two version separately. Now they are considering holding out with the extended edition until 2012.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !,"Dont throw your money away for this meaningles-bluray-version-for-such-a-great-movie thing....Why dont you release extended version ?? Thanks to internet, you can find this now freely !!!"
1,While you are waiting,"While you are waiting until the 2011 or 2012 for this distributor to come to their senses, it's very simple. This would be worth a NetFlix membership if you don't already have one. If you have the Blu-Ray feature, watch all three of these movies on NetFlix. They are the original theatrical vesions, check it out. The extended versions can also be watched in standard DVD format. So, that's my suggestion for while you are waiting.I am also waiting for Star Wars to be out on Blu-Ray, but am not holding my breath on that series either."
1,You thieves! You thieves,"New Line *Gollum*. We'll be nice to them, if they'll be nice to us. Take it off us."
1,"Good Movie, terrible product","This is NOT the extended edition of the trilogy, which is currently unavailable.I could not recommend this to anyone over the full movies. For those of us who already have the DVD version and wish to upgrade, we have to wait until they release the full movies on blu-ray."
1,Just...,...another rip-off. Let's be smart and not buy this one. I'm pleased to see the low rating on this one! Everything has been said about this movie so I won't repeat any of it. I did want to show my frustration with this release though.
2,Extended Cuts,"While I am happy to finaly see the movies on Blu-ray, I am very disapointed that they decided to not release the extended versions of the movie. Blu-ray has already proven that it works beautifly to have multiple versions of a movie on a singe disc. They really missed an oporunity to make everyone very happy with this release... I know that I am going to be stuck waiting."
1,Not Extended - Stop being greedy,Plain and simple... this is not the extended version. I wouldn't even pay 15 dollars for this. There is no excuse.
1,Not Extended Editions,"After watching the extended editions I can't go back to the theatrical versions. I really want to add this to my Bluray collection but I refuse to buy it unless it's the extended editions. The fact that they didn't just release both versions on Bluray at the same time and let people choose which one to buy is ridiculous and greedy. I'll wait, thanks, but in the meantime I'll give this product 1 star because New Line is trying to screw so many people out of money. It's only fair to return the favor."
3,sign......,When will they come out with the extended editions???? theatrical versions can suck it! >:)
1,Hold off already!,"As a consumer who already bought various copies of three different versions of this, many as gifts, over the years, I heartily concur with the view that one should wait. Enjoy your DVD versions in the meantime- at least you'll get some value out of what you purchased previously. If you want a great extended edition Blu-Ray disc, buy The New World, a highly underrated film of tremendous accomplishment. Then, be patient on LOTR."
2,Could Be a Lot Better,"I didn't mind that it was the theatrical version at all but I expected better video and, especially, audio. The picture was a tiny bit better than the regular DVD release upscaled. The audio was a real letdown. Normally, the Blu-Ray's offer Dolby Digital 5.1 as a fallback to folks who don't have 6.1 or 7.1, but this release only offers Dolby Pro-Logic in English. The last two movies do offer 5.1 in Spanish with English subtitles but I pass on that. I know my receiver is okay because when New Line flashed across the screen, I got DD 5.1 but it went away as soon as the movie started. So I have LOTR with video cassette sound."
1,Boo! We want extended edition,Don't be fooled! This is the theatrical edition - why not the extended addition? could it be the distributor is hoping everyone will buy both extended and theaterical release? Why the wait?
1,Wait for the extended version,Just echoing what the majority of the other reviewers have written. Why spend $$$ on the Theatrical release when the extended version is inevitable.
1,I am also waiting for the Extended Edition on bluray.,There is absolutely no (good) reason for delaying the extended edition. I will not purchase this twice... even if it means waiting a year or two.
1,rip-off,"this is such a terrible excuse for a blu-ray release of lord of the rings. blu-ray has the space for the extended versions, the extended versions are already available on dvd, they've waited years after blu-ray won the hd battle to finally put together a release, and now we don't even get the extended versions. please don't buy this release."
1,I'll be renting this version and buying the extended version when...,"Ah, the greed of mankind is not to be underestimated! I do so agree that this little dwarf's purse strings will not be unwound till the extended blu ray edition is released.... thanks to all the others who protest this mean mean move by the studio."
1,Not gonna happen..,"What needs to be said that hasn't already been said?LotR is my favorite movie series ever. Loved the books long before the movies.This is a 5 star MOVIE all the way.New Line Cinema is a 1/2 star studio all the way.There is no reason to not release the extended versions alongside the theatrical release. Well, unless of course you are greedy to the point you don't care about pissing off your customers.I wish Peter Jackson had something to say about this decision. Maybe I'm naive and he doesn't care either, but I would like to think not.New Line won't get a penny more than I absolutely can stand to spend on their products from now on."
1,No cash from me till the real trilogy is released!,Will not be duped by greedy execs at New Line again. There is no reason besides pure greed to not release both versions at once on blu-ray. This goes to show you how much they care about the fans of this great movie. I will make sure everyone I know does not buy this movie for themselves or as a gift.
1,Not another cow to be milked,Releasing the theatrical movies separately from the extended versions on DVD was simply low. Doing it a second time on blu ray is insulting.
1,LOR Stinks,"Agreed. Many of us have bought both the theatrical versions as well as the extended DVD (excellent). I for one, will wait for the extended version Blu-ray. The excellent extended version DVD will do for now, and for years (if it takes that long) for the proper blu-ray to be released."
1,WALLET GOUGING!,Wallet gouging in the worst sense. It would be insulting if it weren't so blatant. New Line must have taken a hint from George Lucas' exploits! Don't buy this. Wait until the extended editions have come out in one Blu-ray package.
1,Release the Extended Version,"Release the extended versions of the movies on Blu Ray, not the shorter theatrical ones..."
1,Don't be fooled again!,"I bought the DVD way back when they released the theatrical version, only they didn't state it as a theatrical version because it would have alerted buyers that another version was coming out: an Extended Version. So I had to spend money to buy the Extended Version too.Now they're coming out with a ""Theatrical Version"" on Blu-Ray, only no one should bother buying it! Just wait until the Extended cut comes out on Blu-Ray."
1,I Will Only Buy the Extended Trilogy!,"They want us to buy the Theatrical Editions now, and then buy the Extended Editions later? No way, Blu-Ray movies are too expensive to double-dip like this. Don't waste your money on the Theatrical Editions, make them release the Extended Edition!"
1,Not the Extended Edtion??,"I hate to give anything related to LOTR 1 star! But, this is ridiculous! By now, most fans who would shell-out money for the Blue-Ray version of these films has seen the extended edition and would agree that they're much better than the theatrical versions, so it's obvious that this is nothing more than a way to milk more money out of the LOTR market and fanbase.I will wait for the extended versions, because I have both versions already, and won't be utterly dying to pay $70 for something I already have, unless it's BOTH versions (or the Extended only) and it better meet the expectations of brilliance that has been Peter Jackson's LOTR."
1,I too will wait.....,I will wait for the extended edition. Why not just include both versions on the same Blu-ray set????????? All about the money I guess. Oh well.
1,Both editions should be released simultaeneously,The attempt to get uneducated consumers to double dip on these films is off-putting. It would be one thing if this was the first time these films were released on home video. It is not. Staggering the release dates to get people to purchase this inferior version leaves a bad taste in peoples mouths as seen in the 1000 negative reviews for this item.
1,DO NOT BUY! WAIT FOR OTHER VERSION!,"DO NOT BUY THIS TRILOGY, WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED BLU-RAY VERSION! THIS IS A RIP OFF!"
1,I disapprove,"Dear New Line,You treat fans of LOTR like dirt. I'm NOT buying this edition. If you release the theatrical versions with the extended versions and not seperately, then i might forgive you....maybe.Sincerely,An annoyed fan."
1,One less sucker here....Only the extendned version will pry my cash from me...,The credit card will not come out until you release the version you know we all want....so why jack us around. Just release it...
1,Rabid Fan Won't Be Buying This Release,"The title pretty much says it all. I'm completely sick of the blatant greed demonstrated by this release. I will admit that I purchased the theatrical releases only to purchase the extended box release when released but this subtle ""shakedown"" attempt only makes me more steadfast to hold out until the bitter end and only buy what is a fair value for a good product. The fans have spoken and demonstrated what the market desires only to be ignored. This epitomizes shameful business practice. I've come to expect no less from Time Warner."
1,Don't Appease the Studios By Wasting Your Money on the Theatrical Versions,The extended versions of these films are what all trilogy lovers are waiting for. This is just a ploy on the part of the studios to cash in on the theatrical versions before releasing the extended versions some time in the future. I have both versions on regular DVD's and can well wait until I get what I want before investing any more money on this trilogy.
1,"Thanks New Line, you just saved me $70","I looked so forward to being able to experience LOTR on blu-ray, so much so that i have not yet purchased any of the other extended editions. I was holding out for the ultimate blu-ray. However, I come to find that I'm stiffed and only the theatrical version is available. Does New Line realize that there is a ton of space to fill on a single blu-ray disc?"
1,"Extended Only, Please","I got screwed when I bought the theatrical release on DVD, and THEN they released the extended versions. That won't happen again.Extended version only, please."
1,Awesome Movie. But wait for the extended version!!!! This is not it!!!,This is the best movie of all time but wait for the extended version to come out on blu-ray. No sense in buying it twice.
1,BRING ON THE EXTENDED VERSIONS!,"I'll be waiting for the EE's. God, I hope Warner re-thinks this.One box set to rule them all!!!!!!!!Please?"
1,Joining the choir,"Don't mind me, I'm just doing my part for the greater good.--------DO NOT BUY THIS COLLECTION.----------Warner is attempting another double dip like they did with the DVD releases.WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED CUTS INSTEAD!That is unless you were one of those strange people who preferred the theatrical cuts over the extended cuts, maybe because you thought it was too long.If you prefer the extended cut, you'll be paying for it later when you realize you're not getting it here."
1,Why even bother....,Why even bother with this when you know there gonna wait a year to sell you the actual version everyone really wants.It's a shame they want to gouge as much money as they can from people to stuff there pockets.I love these movies but i am waiting out for the extended versions.
1,Wait for extended version,"Going to hop on the bandwagon and not approve of this purchase due to the lack of extended editions.With all the space BR discs have, the lack of extended versions is absolutely ridiculous."
1,Extended ONLY!!!,"Do not buy this. I will never buy the movie version of this after owning the extended. SOOOOO much better for the Tolkien fan. Don't get screwed, wait for the extended."
1,Please don't waste our time with this version,"Dear New Line, Why are you doing this? Just by looking at the percentage of people who have posted on Amazon that want the extended version of LOTR should tell you something. I join the others in saying I will not buy the theatrical version again. I bought them when they were first released and gave them away when I bought the extended box set knowing I would not watch them again. For once listen to the trilogy's enormous fan base. Give us the extended set. Thank you."
1,Insulting,It is a great diservice to the fans of this trilogy to take advantage of them all over again.
1,Review of planned theatrical only version release,"This is not a review of the films. The films are great, but the fact that a Blu-ray Disc, which can hold up to 50 GB of data and New Line is pulling this stunt? This is not the extended version with the extras, this is just the theatrical version and I am highly disappointed. You think that that Blu-Ray and LOTR would be a perfect marriage and yet all we get is the theater version. I say thanks but no thanks. I will save my dollars for the extended version. I think thats why the price is set at only $69.00. Give us what we want and we will pay the price for it. Don't give us what we want and YOU will pay the price for it."
1,Seriously?,The theatrical cuts and no extended editions? Is there any reason they can't provide both?
2,Waiting for the Extended Version,Every year we pick a blustery winter weekend day and watch the entire extended versions of all three movies. I was hoping this year we could watch them in HD. Couldn't wait for the Blu-ray edition. But I guess I'll have to. Maybe next year.
1,Boycot Theatrical version,"I've already got the theatrical and Extended versions on dvd. I will boycot the blu until they comeout with the extended versions... Greedy bastards. Thanks for screwing your fans. Makes me want to download ""stuff"" off the internet instead of buying all my stuff legally."
1,Huge Mistake,"Unbelievable that in this day and time of history, with our economy in the toilet and with money so tight, THIS company has decided to release these wonderful films on blu ray in this fashion. All of that space on these discs and there is no room for extended versions? What kind of foolishness is this? Shame on you. Do not be fooled again, people. Do not buy this set TWICE. They must learn and only we can teach them.Cheers."
1,Stop double-dipping,"What, they didn't make enough $$ from these movies - they now want us to keep paying to see it?Bring us the extended edition already!"
1,No thanks Warner/New Line,"Greed...plain & simple on Warners part. Hopefully people don't buy the theatrical Blu's, stick to their guns & wait for the EE's. If this happens maybe that will force Warner to release the EE's earlier........one can only hope."
1,You got to be kidding!,"Theatrical Edition on Blu-ray. What happen to the extended edition or at the very least offer both. I guess if you have money to waste you will buy this version. I so wanted to see LOTR trilogy on my 1080P 70 inch TV. I won't watch this version out of spite. I can't believe Peter Jackson would do this to us or was it a studio decision? In any case I will pass as most die hard fans. I agree with another fan, that is why people buy bootleg copies of movies. Bring us the extended version on Blu-ray with a discount for owners of the original DVD. That is the reason I purchased Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray. I got $10 back for the upgrade."
1,What the Frak??,It sounds like Peter Jackson and New Line are suffering from 'Lucasism' with this money grubbing non extended version release. BRING OUT THE EXTENDED VERSIONS TOO!!!
1,GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY!!!!,"Everyone here is right, they are coming out with the extended cut on blu-ray soon right after this release. They could so easily put the theatrical and extended in one package but I guess theres more money to be made if ""sold seperately"" and for that I will buy neither. If you're gonna be greedy, atleast try not to make it so obvious."
2,I know someone's going to shoot me over this...,"Am I the only person in America who does NOT like the Lord of the Rings movies? I fell asleep 4 times during the second one, and just couldn't bring myself to part with even cheap matinee dollars to go see part III. I don't find hobbits cute or endearing or entertaining. Slow, slow, slow...that's all I have to say."
1,Bad New Line!,DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!!!
1,Put LOTR on Full Screen on Bluray,"I have a 47"" Full HD TV and when i watched LOTR on HD on TV it was broadcasted in FULLSCREEN showing all its glory. Why cant Hollywood produce more movies that will fill up every square inch of our TV.Some of the best Blurays are displayed in all their glory on Full Screen like the Planet Earth series. Watching the same series with the blackbars would ruin the whole experience.We pay anything from $4k t $10k for a full HD 47"" and larger TV. That works out to more then $90 per square inch. So it is reasonable for us to expect epic movies to be short in a native aspect ratio that will fill the entire screen.Get rid of the Blackbars please. They are a drag."
5,Impressed!,"The package was in amazing condition...brand new! I would have had to pay tripple the amount for the same thing bought at a store.I've made a lot of purchases though amazon, but never one so securely wrapped. Excellent packaging and arrived in great time too!"
2,Poor quality,"Excellent response time/shipping from vendor. Poor quality of DVD's though. Right out of the box, Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers both have places where the DVD's skip, or act like there are scratches on them when there are none. I've tried in three different DVD players with the same result."
1,I can't believe this!,"I finally get an HD TV and blu ray player. I'm excited to see one of my favorite movies in HD...then I find out they don't have the extended edition out! *sigh* I will not be buying the theatrical edition, so I guess I will just have to wait."
1,Another Money Grab!,Don't buy this product!Wait for the extended editions to be released to Bluray before you spend.
1,Unleash the Extended Editions on Blu-ray!,"Please release the extended editions at a higher price point and let us, the consumers, choose if they want to purchase the theatrical editions or spend some extra money and purchase the extended editions.It is not fair to us, the consumer, to buy these theatrical editions in June and then have to purchase the extended editions when they are released by next holiday season.Obviously, the extended content is there as it was created for the DVD's, just come our with another extended edition box set in Blu-ray and everyone will be happy. I see this box set being boycotted by us, the consumers, and you guys losing $. Do the right thing and everyone wins."
1,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...","Boycott any theatrical release of this movie. Yes some only want to see the original theatrical version on Blue-ray but that is not the point. The point is greed, the ability and willingness to screw over faithful fans and customers for the sake of making a ludicrous amount of money instead of an insane amount of money. Stand firm and do not bend, it is time to take a stand and make them pay."
1,Blatant attempt at milking the consumer,"I excitedly purchased the trilogy on DVD, only to have the extended edition come out a few months later. The fact that they're doing the same thing with the Blu-Ray editions is an insult. Do not buy."
1,Avoid This Poor Cash Grab,"Like hundreds other here, I hope people take notice that this is not the extended edition, but the theatrical release; a clear attempt to confuse consumers and have them re-buy the extended versions down the road."
1,Twice fooled? Shame on you!,"Most of us were tricked into buying both the original & extended. Granted, the extended came on 4 DVD's each. But there is no excuse for releasing both versions seperatly. If you are fooled again, shame on you. ""A fool and his money are separated quickly""."
1,I'll join in the boycott,I have to agree with everyone here. Double dipping on the DVD was a tasteless move but double dipping on the blu rays is even worse. We have wanted the extended edition of Lord of the Rings ever since the format was first released 3 years ago. I am happy to see people taking a vocal stand against this practice. Hitting the bank account is the only true way to communicate to these companies.
1,Double Dipping,"I already was suckered with the DVD's, I'm not buying this series 4 times I'll wait for Blu-Ray Extended version and sell the others!"
1,Just to show my support for the boycott,"I will not buy this one, folks. All those who are boycotting this Blu-Ray, I am with you."
2,Just the Theatrical version?,"Just the theatrical edition? Sorry New Line; the extended version is far, far better and more true to the book. I am afraid my desire for the Blu-Ray edition of the trilogy has been dampened to the level of ""do not purchase"" without the Extended Edition."
1,Wow...,"Absolutely pathetic that New Line would pull this with one of the most anticipated blu-ray releases. Ironically, many of us wish that Lucas will release the original theatrical movies of Star Wars (rather than his 'revamps' from the re-release).Hopefully consumers show New Line where to stick this awful attempted at extorting money from their fan base."
1,"What they said... LETS GET To 1,000 PROTESTERS!!!!!!!!!!","Wait until New Line offers an extended/theatrical version with premium special edition and behind the scenes material. We've been sharked way too often and cant afford to have this happen again (1st when it came to dvd, especially in this economic climate when money is tighter than usual."
1,Tolkien is rolling over in his grave with this.,"Bad form New Line. JRR Tolkien himself is rolling over in his grave at the amount of Greed you display with this fiasco.As others have stated, both editions could have easily fit in one release.If you feel you must release both editions in separate products at least have the DECENCY of giving us the GOOD(Extended) set first.I will NOT being paying for this double dip again. I will wait as long as I must to get the Extended Version. Period."
1,Not going to get me four times.....,"I've been there and done that with LOTR already. When they originally came out I purchased the theatrical versions day one, and picked up the Extended sets when they were released. I have no intention to spend another 80.00 for these and then go out and spend another 80-100.00 for the extended."
1,Extended or nothing!,Ditto for me.....I'm not about to rebuy LOTR on Bluray unless it's the Extended edition.
1,"Nice try, New Line","I've been watching the EXTENDED cut on standard DVD, upscaled to my HD monitor, and it looks FANTASTIC. I can wait as long as it takes for you to release THE WHOLE THING."
1,Do not buy this,"we have to send a message,this is nothing but greed, I have been waiting for these films on Blu-ray since day one. I want the extended versions of coarse I will wait for them. I can not afford to buy both. I WILL WAIT FOR EXTENDED VERSIONS."
1,Rip-off,Don't buy the theatrical version. New Line is just trying to squeeze every possible penny out of our pockets.
2,the lord of the rings trilogy on blu-ray,"this movie alone is great and it finnally should come to blu ray, but i agree the extended cuts of the films should be relased asell. there is plenty of room and people are going to want to see them. Im not buying this version untill the extended cut version is definetlly out first. Still a great movie to watch on blu-ray."
1,One Blu-Ray To Rule Them All......FAIL!!!,"I'm not going to rehash what the other 3000+ reviewers have already said. The extended editions didn't just add 5 minutes of or an extra scene.....it was a substantial addition. I have enjoyed my extended edition DVDs for years now, and couldn't imagine going back to the theatrical editions....even for Blu-ray. Hopefully they will realize their blunder and produce the extended edition Blu-rays because that is what we, the fans, want."
1,My goodness!!!!,"I have to agree, I've brought this collection twice. Enough is enough! I know they have made their money over and over twice. I will buy the blu-ray extended edition when ever they put it out. But If I knew what I know now about the greedy film industry, I would have just waited for the blu-ray extended edition in the first place."
1,I'll be waiting for the Extended Versions,"Love all three movies. Arguably, the best films of all time, and I'm sure they will look great on Blu-Ray. However, I LOATH the fact that the studio is trying to milk us for every dollar they can. Refuse to buy this product! The disks do not contain the far superior Extended Editions, but the weak theatrical versions which by comparison now seem hollow. Obviously the plan is to force us all to buy these first, and then a few years from now have to buy the Extended Versions. (Same as was done with the original release on DVD) I played the game with the endless litany of Star Wars releases. I don't want to play anymore with LOTR.Save your money for the Extended Versions, and boycott this money grab!"
1,Rip-off without extended editions,I will not buy these movies on Blu-Ray until they include the extended editions. It is a big con. I got tricked into buying the original DVDs only to have the extended DVDs released shortly after. I won't be tricked a second time. Shame on New Line!
1,IXNAY,"The trilogy is a true milestone in fantasy films. However, I will not give another penny to those misers, whose attempt to squeeze blood from a turnip rivals that of George Lucas."
1,lotr...5-stars...studio 1-star....,"might be a different story if the extended version had never been released on dvd. this is a shame and another slap-in-the-face to those loyal fans of lotr and bd. the trilogy was on tv this past weekend and my daughter and i watched them all.....again. when rotk ended, i didn't feel ""less fulfilled"" because of the reduction in quality. i am also on the list of those that will wait; and will be first in line for the extended version release."
1,"Extended version, please!","I also am waiting for the extended BluRay version. As soon as it is available, I will buy, but until then, no sale!"
1,water from a stone,"how much money needs to be made on the fan of these fantastic movies? this product is a disrespectful, cynical installment in the continuing rip-off of the fan--shameful. the director's cuts will be the next release--that should have been this release--do not buy."
5,Great experience product arrived early if not on time.,I bought this item used and surprisingly there wasn't a scratch on any of the discs. I would definitely do business with these guys again. Been a pleasure.
5,Excellent Movies,The extended Editions really capture the essence of the novels and create a much better and entertaining experience.
1,What a Shame....,"Releasing this Blu-ray without the extended versions is a sad commentary on how New Line and Jackson seem to have put dollars before artistic integrity. I won't buy this version. As for the extended versions that I once considered ""an obvious purchase""? I will think twice before owning them when they become available."
5,The Lord of the Rings Trilogy,The product was just as advertised. It arrived in a very timely manner. I gave it as a Christmas gift and the recipient was very pleased with the gitft.
1,No EE and lackluster picture quality reviews,I am in the same camp as most. I absolutely adore the series and the effort by Peter Jackson but in this economy vote with your wallet. Demand the Extended Edition and for god's sake clean up the picture. They can do it but greed is apparent here. I read the reviews on multiple Blu-ray review sites while the sound is stellar with DTS-HD MA.and the picture quality and sharpness is all over the place. This is not 30 year old movie.
1,Long wait and not worth it.,"Again as many have said the movies are 5 stars, but this edition in terms of quality and transfer is sub-par. Guys we waited so long for these films in top notch blu-ray quality to do the films justice and you release them half assed, with an AVERAGE picture? Are you serious? My suggestion is to just wait until they can make the transfer look better and get the extended editions."
1,Quadruple dip,Read the other views to see how preposterous it is to only release the theatrical versions without seemless branching. Send a message & don't buy this from the Warner Bros. money grubbers.
1,I won't buy it twice,I won't buy this twice! The extended version on DVD that I have now will do me just fine thank you very much. The billions raked in by these movies isn't enough? You have to insult the fans by releasing a sub-par blue ray edition? Shame on you!
1,Way to create consumer waste.,"I wanted the movie so bad, but when I picked it up and read it was not the full version I laughed. I love collecting movies to support the artists, but I am in no way into screwing up the earth more than it already is just becuase some company wants to earn a quick buck. Seeing them doing this with one of my favorite movies has almost made me switch from hard copies just to downloading the files. I feel like calling up the company to yell, but I am sure they could care less about the consumer and even less about an enviromental issue.Great movie, cheap and selfish move from the studio."
1,RIP OFF!,"Another rip off from New Line! There is no reason why they should not have released both the Extended and Theatrical at the same time. Even if they wanted to rake us, at least release both versions as seperate products!"
1,"Another New Line Theatrical version only tactic, DONT BUY","New Line Cinema has once again tride the almighty arm bending tactic to wrench profit from the public, without the extended version included on the Blu Ray disc set they wont get a ""NICKLE"" from me. I am tired of getting stuck by the Industry that i frequent with my hard earned money. Its the right thing to do for the public when you create the product for all the masses as it should be without having to stick your hand back in thier wallets to make them buy it again for the extended versions of the film. ATTENTION NEW LINE EXECS, i hope one of your lackey coffee service people get you to see these reviews and how much your viewers (THE ONES WHO SUPPORT YOUR LIVING) are tired of taking a financial knife in the back."
1,Extended Editions or Nothing!,Not going to buy every version ever just like the studio wants; give us the Extended Edition or nothing!
1,Add me to the Extended Versions list.,"The only way ill be buying this is if they releases the extended versions...Just a tip for the next reviewer if you guys want the extended versions don't rate this a 5 star, give it a 1 star instead to show how we feel."
1,I'm saving up for the EXTENDED VERSIONS!!!,"I have to agree with everybody else... I love these movies but why would I spend my money on the regular versions when I can hold out for the extended versions?!? The industry is just trying to squeeze every last penny from the consumers, even with Blu-Ray when you can fit so much more data on one disc! It's bad enough I they sell some multi-set movies individually when they can easily have the entire set for a little less than the price you'd pay for each movie when trying to complete the set. Enough is enough!!!"
1,Stealing our money,As this is NOT the extended version OR that all 3 movies are included.....what is the incentive? You already own the product. This is just to take more money from you. (Just because they can is an insult. Finally getting a Blu-ray version and this is what they are able to put out? Don't waste your money!)I am disappointed that Peter Jackson has agreed with this packaging.
1,Do not buy this!!! RIP OFF ALERT!!!,i will not purchase this...... what a rip off!!! the extended versions are the best and all they want to do is give us the versions few people want. do not buy this garbage!!!!
1,Not worth the money,"Blu-ray of the Extended Versions would be worth the price. As it is, the standard DVD's of the Extended Versions look pretty good upscaled and viewed from my sofa 12 feet away."
1,"Yep, Yet again New Line doesn't get it.","First to the person that said, I wish you would stop crying all I need is the theatrical version, well good for you, You are getting what You want. but the vast majority of us love the EXTENDED VERSION and should not have to settle for less, AGAIN. Shame on you New Line for doing this, all over yet again. But thankfully I have blockbuster, I'll just rent them until the extended versions come out, AGAIN,, seeing a common theme here?????????????????????????? New Line, We want to love you HELP US, HELP YOU"
1,I'll wait,"My favorite movies of all-time, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, managed to surprise and anger me with the two-phase release of first theatrical and then extended versions. We have become accustomed to this marketing tactic by now, and few of us are likely to be taken in again. We'll wait more-or-less patiently for the real thing, the extended edition."
1,Don't buy another rippoff.,"If we refuse to purchase this non-extended version, the extendted Blu Ray version will be released earlier. Be patient, and wait. why would you even consider buying and inferior product. Don't be ripped off again."
1,A complete waste of time,"Who is this Blu-ray marketed for? Other than fans no one is interested in things ""Lord of the Rings"". A fan of the movies would not waste their money on theatrical versions of these film but instead would wait for the release of the extended version on Blu-ray. Again, Hollywood gets it wrong."
1,New Line GREED! (Blu-ray version),NO WAY I would buy this version that only has the regular theatrical releases instead of the Extended Versions. What a GREEDY RIP OFF!But maybe that's shouldn't be a surprise. Remember the big brouhaha a while back about New Line failing/refusing to pay Mr. Jackson and company all that was due to them after completing this fantastic trilogy?
1,SAME THING WILL HAPPEN WITH STAR WARS,"I've been on the war path when it comes to these damn studios and their shameless manipulation. First, they pass off CAST AWAY and T2 as blu-ray movies (when they are really not), then they pull this nonsense with LOTR. And when it comes time for Fox to put the STAR WARS series out, they will repeat the same BS and the same suckers will line up to buy STAR WARS."
1,"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice ...","Please wait, this behaviour needs to be discouraged. At a minimum, please buy it used (same message, and you help a brother out). Thanks, M"
1,Why get ripped off a third and fourth time?,"I agree with all the above statements why it is irritating forcing people to wait years later to actually get the movie they wanted only as a ploy to get people to pay for several releases at premium cost.Instead of buying the blu ray theatrical version, and then the following year buy all three movies again in the extended version (for... How much Money?) Rent these movies,if you really need to see these same movies again in HD on blu ray, or watch on streaming video, or Comcast, etc.Then when the actual movie we all want to collect, the blu ray version of the extended release version comes out, buy only that series.Anyway, that's what I'm going to do."
1,Failtastic!,"This is blatant and downright theft. They could with seamless branching have both in one package. Especially with the economy now they are just taking money from the people who don't realize its not extended or the people who simply can't wait. You have already waited this long, you mine as well wait until the extended version comes out anyways."
1,Stop the double-dipping!,"Peter Jackson's movie is worth 500 stars. This packaging is worth 0 stars, (so it gets a 1).Blu-ray has WAY more than enough space to pack the union of ALL the special features anyone could ever want on a companion blu-ray with the Extended Editions, so the argument for distinct special features between this set and the someday-will-be-released extended set is moot.Also, the technology to do a seamless runtime edit of a movie during playback has been around since the dawn of DVD (take a look at the Terminator 2 DVDs... Many of them have 4 different cuts of the movie, all seamlessly accessible from the menu and all on a single disc, with no duplication of content! New Line, you can ship one set, the EXTENDED set we all want, and give us the option to view the movie with or without the extended sequences... all from the same discs.This packaging attempt is blatant double-dipping and we will not have it!-jer"
1,seriously?,"they haven't made ENOUGH money already off of these (admittedly) masterpiece movies? not that I support piracy, but i know plenty of people that see this kind of greed and use it to justify downloading the movies..."
1,rip off!,wow. i think i'll just download the 1080p extended versions instead of paying anything after this greedy rip-off! For f*** sake already.
1,Another Rip Off,I concur with the hundreds of other reviewers in giving this effort 1 star. Of course the item really deserves no stars and when and if they put out the extended versions in Blu Ray I'll be there. Until then I won't spend a cent.
1,Etended release or no release,"We've already bought the non blue ray, the only reason to buy again is to get the extended release. Really."
1,Money Grubbing Terrorists...,We're not going to buy this version of the movie. We're all going to wait for the extended version on Blu-ray. Your bid to double-dip your fan base has failed.
1,Ditto!,"Same here. My knees got weak when I learned the BluRay had finally come out. Then I see it is the Theatrical version. My first thought was ""rip off!"" The only way to let the studios know is to let these copies rot on the shelves so that they actually lose money on the version and stores will have to bargain bin it for $19.99 just to get them off the shelves. I will gladly buy the extended version once they come out. Of course, then they will probably only release them one at a time. When we have all bought our extended Bluray, they will release a ""Collectors Edition"" Blu-Ray to !@@$@$ us one more time."
1,New Line won't suck money out of me twice,"The rumor on the blu-ray geek sites is that the extended editions will be released on blu-ray in 2012, just before ""The Hobbit"" goes to theaters. As long as that is away, I will wait. If I want to see the theatrical versions on blu-ray between now and then, I can always rent."
1,I agree with the majority of you,"I was contemplating that exact thing the other day. I had no clue that many reviews had come up in regards to this exact topic. I love Lord of the Rings and I have just now converted to blu-ray, which is not a cheap thing to do. They released the theatrical versions first, then the extended ones, then the package that had both the theatrical and extended versions. I hope they will get smart and QUICK and release the trilogy in a theatrical and extended version format in one package."
1,Gandalf would be ashamed...,"at your pitiful attempts to rip-off consumers. I for one am not going to be among those to buy this product. I totally and absolutely love LOTR, but this is just utterly ridiculous. Either you give us the extended versions or you won't be seeing a penny from me."
1,Croooooks!,"Favorite movie of all time. I bought all three original releases on dvd, then i bought all extended versions on dvd, and now im willing to upgrade to a blu version. Ive waited a looooong time for a high def release, and sadly it is the original cuts, how disapointing! you guys (studio) already got a ton of money off me from the dvd's, now you think i must have my lotr hd fix, so ill buy your first release, then again once the extended release comes out, i dont think so. im keeping my money for now and waiting. why couldnt you guys just give us true fans what we wanted? havnt we waited long enough?"
1,How much longer must we wait!?,"Sorry Gandalf, you are going to have to wait until your masters decide to release the extended versions of the movie trilogy. I agree with the majority on Amazon in saying this delay is rude to the consumer. Where is your ethic?"
1,LOTR cash grab!,"Why is Time Warner releasing separate versions of the Lord of the Rings in the Blu-Ray format? Answer, it's a cash grab. Wait for the extended version if you must have the LOTR Trilogy in the Blu-Ray format. Would have given this item 0 stars for the greedy corporate marketing."
1,Give us both versions in the same package,"Well I am an avid fan of Lord of the rings and I have both versions on dvd. I love the extended version and I was very happy when I heard that they would eventually publish it in blue ray format.I believe, as others have said, that they could have included the theatrical and extended version in the same package. It would be nicer, practical and they would show that they truly appreciate the movie and the fans.This is a rip off and they have no excuse for it. Wait for the extended."
1,One star --with a challenge,"I am joining the vast crowd of fans of the Lord of the Rings who want the extended version in Blu Ray. I, however, have a challenge for all the other one star reviewers--I read the books every year in September for Bilbo's birthday. Have you ever read the trilogy? Do you know what is left out of even the extended versions?? I challenge all one star reviewers to buy and read the books. I don't care if you read them in hardcover, paperback, on an e book, on your I Phone, etc., but give some money to the Tolkien Trust by actually reading the books!"
1,Lord Of The Rings (Theatrical Editions),"Yes I must agree with everybody else. I just watched Lord of the Rings Extended Edition last night. And the added content fills in so much more on the story. Good thing the ol blu-ray player makes regular dvd's look better! I can definately wait for the extended versions to come out. Too bad studios, you could have gotten some coin from me right now but instead, you'll be waiting just like me. :) Whats really sad is they could actually put both versions on a single release and satisfy all. Thanks to all for letting us know ahead of time before we made a bad purchase. Bottom line the extended is way better than the theatrical especially if you haven't sat down and read the books like me."
1,screwing us over... again!,i can see the movie industry dying within my lifetime if they keep this up.
1,Total RIP-OFF,"I honestly can't believe how the producers of this Bluray edition of The Lord of the Rings are making a fool of us, the customers.And we wonder why we are in the middle of an economic crisis..."
1,Bullcrap,"Wow, just wow. I already paid for this movie twice (DVD Theatrical, then Extended when that came out). I never watch the theatrical anymore, and my fiance points out how we already own two copies of this. I'd love to see it in bluray, but I'm NOT going to buy this twice too. I'm having a hard time even convincing her it's a good idea to get the extended version in blueray because of this shady crap. A greedy-self serving release. The movie gets 5 stars. New Line's business practices get 0 stars. Stop holding the extended version hostage and just release it already. It's been long enough!"
5,written,the movies were great i love them and so does my husband they were a birthday present for him we were very satisfied thank you
1,I Agree With The Mob,"I think it was expected that New Line would do the sleazy thing and release only the theatrical versions first. They're hoping overeager fans will purchase this to tide them over and then they want people to repurchase the extended versions. Hopefully people won't give in, although both versions are great, the extended versions are far superior to the theatrical versions. I wasn't expecting both in one package. But it would be nice to have the option of purchasing either version."
1,Obviously a RIP OFF!!!,"This trilogy should be released one of two ways.1. As a deluxe boxed set featuring BOTH theatrical and extended editions.OR2. Simultaneously released as two boxed sets. The first theatrical, the second extended.The ONLY reason for the release being done in this order is to try and grab our money twice. Personally, there are hundreds of other movies I'd rather buy on Blu-Ray than the theatrical editions of LOTR.FAIL"
1,A Waist of Packaging- Extended Edition or Nothing!,This is another pathetic attempt at forcing the public to purchase these movies. Stop trying to follow the puerile marketing system of George Lucas. The only thing that will make us buy these movies YET AGAIN is the full HD Extended Edition. No one should fall for this. They can defiantly fit both versions of the film on ONE DISC with current Blu-ray technology. This is a scam- don't buy into it.
1,Why 5-star reviews,I don't understand all these people giving this crap a 5 star review and then saying they aren't going to buy it and that they are going to wait for the extended. Give this garbage the review it deserves!
1,Don't buy unless you know what you are getting,"As many customers have already expressed, this seems like a pretty unfair scam from our ""friends"" at Newline. I sincerely hope there is a better explanation, and that the extended versions will become available soon. This movie is just to good to get the wrong edition."
2,Another blatant rip-off,"So the hype was that with blu ray we'd have extra features blah blah blah BUT one of these was that we'd have multiple versions of the same film ie original theatrical release and the directors cut etc. So what happens with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy ? They do the same rip-off they did with the DVD's.. release the ""bare bones"" version first to be ultimately followed by bigger,better, more versions (how many dvd versions are there now ? I lost count).It's bad enough we get stung paying more for discs pressed using the same methods as dvds (why is that anyway...oh right exploitationism), now we face another interminable string of ""new release"" versions.I for one WON'T be rushing out to buy ANY version of this series until I see the ""last,best"" version come out.Fool me once ..shame on you...."
1,What a waste,"Purchased the original Theatrical Editions on DVD. Studio later releases Extended Editions on DVD (I purchased them again.)Not planning on wasting any money this time. Come on, release these the correct way and offer them as Extended Edition."
1,You will be disappointed with this theatrical version!!,If you have the LOTR DVDs(either extended or the shorter theatrical version) you will be disappointed with this release!! Wait for the extended blu ray version. Don't waste your money unless you have excess money to waste.
1,Bought this twice already!!!,I'm sick and tired of buying movies in different formats and in different editions. I've already bought this twice on dvd & I know an extended cut is coming so why waste more of my money on a movie I already own!
1,I will not buy this version of the films,"One star for a five star film series only because it is the theatrical version.The extended versions are the versions worth owning. After releasing the extended versions, re releasing the theatrical version is an insult to the fans. I am waiting for the extended version to be released on Bluray. I will not buy LoTR on BD until the extended version is released."
1,Movies not money!,"At the risk of repeating what has already been offered, I must say I am disappointed at the decision to release the Theatrical version in 'BluRay instead of the later extended version. What possible motive other than $ ? I will join the movement not to purchase the BluRay LOTR discs until they are released in Extended version.In the mean time, my BluRay player does an excellent job up converting the extended version DVDs to 1080p. The quality is excellent on my 70 in XSRD Sony HD via my 7 channel surround sound AV processor. That will serve me just fine until the genius MBA who made this destructive decision changes his mind or gets fired and they bring out the extended version in BluRay."
1,Oh no they didn't!!!,"tst tst tst. I'm extremely disappointed in you New Line. You have all of these adoring fans that have made this trilogy one of the most successful movie franchise of all time, and you go and do something like this. You got us to buy both the theatrical and extended versions of the film on dvd, and yet you dare attempt to manipulate us into doing the same thing on a new format. I'm insulted and disgusted. Your greed is going to cost you. It sounds like most of us our onto your little scheme, and we're not buying. You know what the fans want. Give us the one blu-ray release to rule them all."
1,I won't buy it!!!,"Why should I buy this movie when I know they will release de ext. version in six months?!? I'm not a fool Warner, I won't buy it!!!"
1,WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED VERSION,Just wait for the extended edition of the greatest trilogy since the original Star Wars Saga!
1,Need the EXTENDED edition on Bluray!!!,I need to watch 12+ hours of high-def material on bluray or else my head will explode. Really.
1,You can't be serious!!,"Once you've seen the extended versions, how could you ever buy the theatricals... even if they are in BluRay. Don't be fooled, hold out for the EXTENDED BluRay version."
1,No extended edition - NO THANKS.,I hope this is a dismal failure on the sales charts. You're not getting 1 cent of my money until the extended edition is released.
1,Outrageous,The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]Blu-ray has the space for all editions of the movies. Give Me A Break
1,They think we be slow.,Just a few weeks ago a friend and I were having a beer before we headed in to a ball game. For what ever reason we brought up how great this trilogy was...and that most likely they will release the crappy theatrical version first on blue-ray so they can double dip with the extended version. I'll be watching my DVD version until you stop trying to screw us.
1,Where's the extended version?,"While I'm sure this theatrical release bluray would look great sitting on the shelf next to the regular edition DVD and the extended DVD set, enough is enough. No excuse for not having both versions of the movie on the same disc. You can get a Blade Runner set with FIVE different versions of the movie for the price of a regular bluray. Disney included dual versions with extended songs and scenes on the same disc for the Lion King and Beauty and the Beast DVDs, and nobody is better at milking video sales like those guys.Rent this version if you can't wait, then eventually buy a set that allows you to watch either version of the movie."
1,Two Words,"Extended Version. I bought the first three when they came out as regular clam shell theatrical edition dvd's, and then ended up re-buying the extended editions at full price when they were released. I'm not making that mistake again.This is ridiculously shady."
1,I was soooooo mad!,I watched all three movies in the theater in one day to see the director's cut of both Fellowship and Two Towers and then watch the premier of Return. I own both the orginal DVD's and the Box set director's cuts editions. Give me a break. I will buy a Blu-ray of the extended versions but never a theatrical. RipppppOfffff!!!!!
1,"Both Versions Please, and Tame the DNR!!",'Nuff already said about including the extended versions. Now HighDefDigest reports that the video quality is all over the map with Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) being applied heavy handedly. Too bad there isn't a real life Gandalf or Frodo to put these wrongs to right!!!! I'll just rent from NetFlix until the real deal comes along.
1,Theatrical Edition Sucks,"Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS RELEASE OR RENT IT.New Line should be ashamed of themselves for releasing the theatrical edition. With Blu-ray, they had a responsibility to release the Extended Edition of this film series. They should have just included both versions in this release, instead, we get the usual Hollywood crap of forcing fans to double buy this title and you know they're going to release the extended edition later this year.When will these studios learn that consumers are tired of movie studios are kicking consumers in the gut.The Lord of the Rings movies represent some of the best movies out there but this review is for New Line Cinema and their decision to release the Theatrical version of the movies on Blu-ray instead of releasing the Extended Edition ..."
1,Do you have too much money?,"Then this item is for you! For the rest of us, just wait until the extended editions are released, which honestly is the true complete vision of these films (unless they come out with the re-extended verisons)."
1,TIme Warner Trying to Get You To Pay 4 Times,"Like Others, I am a huge fan of the movies - would give them 6 stars - but having bought the theatrical edition as well as the extended edition, I find it insulting that the company is trying to hold out the extended edition on blue ray - and get you to essentially pay for 4 $75 box sets. Very disappointing."
1,Waiting for extended edition,"Movie studios (like the music industry) never learn. They treat customers with disrespect. As others have mentioned, the extended version is already done, why does it take 2 years to get it on blu ray?"
1,"Bad marketing move, where is the Long Play Platinum Version","The first DVD's I wanted to replace with Blu-ray was this trilogy. The fact that they released this version at all to blu-ray is insulting and just ticks me off. Unformtunately, I will be buying the long play versions as I love the movies too much to make a point by not buying either version. If you are unfamilar with the difference, you definitely do not want to buy this version!!!!! You will be disappointed when the long play platinum version comes out and you wasted your money on this version."
1,Not falling for it,I love LOTR but I'm not triple-dipping. I'm waiting for the extended set insteadThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Editions) [Blu-ray]
1,Great movie but its just wrong,Its a five star movie with a one star marketing scheme. I have both the original theatrical releases and the extended version. Trust me when I say I havent cracked open the originals since I bought the extended ones. Its not like they need the money. What happened to the first billion they made. Im waiting patiently.
1,Give us the PROPER BluRay set,"New Line your greed is showing - haven't you heard greed is out? There is no excuse for doing a separate standard release BluRay set. The BluRay set should have both the theatrical and extended releases on the same set. At the very least, if you must release separate versions, you should release them both together.Fool me once: shame on you, fool me twice: shame on me. I suspect this will be a slow selling BluRay set."
1,Why bother?,"Very disappointing that they are trying to draw this out again. I was ok paying for moth versions the first time, but not this time around. I'll wait for the full version on Blu-Ray."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Wait for Extended version. No way I'll be spending my money on this. I already have the extended version on DVD.
1,theatrical? Are u Kidding me? NO WAY!,Shame on you!I have longed to see the extended version in Fully High Definition. Why wasting 70 dollars for this edition?This is an abuse! Believing consumers are fools and pushing them of a non-sense release when everyone expects the EXTENDED editions.DON'T BUY THIS VERSION. AND WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED LOTR RELEASE.PERIOD.
1,"Great Movie, Ripoff Release",I don't need to repeat what hundreds of others have stated in their reviews. Wait for the extended versions instead.
1,NO LotR on Blu-ray unless Extended Edition,"I agree wholeheartedly with those demanding the extended version of this title.There is absolutely NO reason, other than greed and manipulation, that the extended editions should be held back while the theatrical versions are released.I join my fellow brethren in calling for the release of the extended versions on blu-ray disc along with the theatrical version. As those who have said before me, I too decree that you will NOT see any of my hard earned money for this release until the extended versions are released on Blu-ray!"
1,Enough manipulation,I love this movie but I will not be manipulated by the company. I will buy the blue ray version ONLY when the extended edition is put on Blue Ray. The company's greed just back fired big time!
1,can we at least get a release date on any of the editions?,"its terrible enough that they are bleeding money from people by releasing editions at separate times,but the part thats even worse is they wont release any dates on when there coming out. would someone throw them a clue as to how to treat potential customers. if this is really coming out then so be it,itll be nice to rent them to get my blu ray lotr fix til the real ones come out. just make up your mind what your doing and do it! postponing things will just irritate fans even more!"
1,No extended verision?,Again they are not releasing extended version at the time of releasing theatrical version. Shame on them.
1,Wait for the Extended Edition,"...rather than buying the theatrical edition. Supposing you love the theatrical editions, you'll agree that the extended editions should be available simultaneously, right? What other possible motivation could there be to not release them simultaneously other than a Sauron-esque desire to squeeze every last ounce of profit by appealing to the uber-die hards that can't wait to get something, anything, to play on their new Blu-ray player.For Shame. I will wait and buy the Extended Edition on Blu-ray."
1,Another blatant RIPOFF by this company,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! They are out to milk the fans for every dime they can get. Wait for the extended versions!!!! This version is a RIPOFF!!!!
2,LORD OF THE RINGS,"was pleased but one of the discs was severely scratched to where I missed quite a bit of the movie, one out of four not bad."
5,On time and as advertised,I received product in time frame I was told it would arrived and it was in the condition that was specified (like new). Good experience.
3,no way,"Sorry New Line/WB, I'll wait for the extended Directors cut, after buying both ways on DVD, not going to do that with Blu-Ray, the Theatrical editions don't make as much sense as the Trilogy, the story line is much more compelling on the extended edition"
4,Is it rushed?,"Absolutely brilliant and epochal as this trilogy is, you have to wonder why they're planning to release a box set already when they could just save for a future release as a money-maker. This box set is obviously bad news (or just indifference) for the millions of people who already have the theatrical DVD's.Nevertheless, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a truly fantastic movie-making achievement, and one that deserves to be owned by everyone as a cornerstone in their movie collection. For people like me, who only own the deluxe versions of the movie, this box set will be beneficial. It's just a shame we have no new movie to look forward to anymore, December is going to seem so cold now. Lord of the Rings forever! I can't wait for the special edition re-release in 20 years!"
4,Waiting for the Extended Edition Trilogy.,"I made the mistake of buying the theatrical DVD for Fellowship of the Ring, and then the extended edition came out later. For The Two Towers, I waited and only bought the extended edition. Will do the same for The Return of the King. I do find it anoying that they release the theatrical version so many months before the version they know we really want, hoping we will go ahead and buy it while we are waiting."
1,Ripoff,I'm not spending money on a ripoff. You should have given us both versions right from the start and stop trying to rip off your customers.
1,this is an eye opener...,"First i was surprised to see barely 2 stars for this movie by over 2000 reviewers. But then it made me curious to see why has it been such low profiled by the reviewers, because this is one my all time favorites movies.What an eye opener all these reviews are!!! its not about the movie but about the DVD edition, i agree with all the reviewers, after all this long wait its not worth paying of blu ray DVD which is not ""extended version"" of the movie... this is really a rip off.I will better wait for extended version of the blu ray, rather than paying for this version. All these reviews are good eye opener. Thanks everyone. Its worth rating 1 star for Blu-Ray edition of the movie but my 5 stars to these great movies..."
1,Wait for the Extended Version,For Shame! The EXTENDED Version BluRay should be offered along side the theatrical release. GIVE ME THE REAL ONE RING! The studio will not get another dime from me until then. I would not even rent it.
1,"again, trying to rip the consumer off.",Theatrical editions... if you're a casual fan sure go ahead and buy it. If you're a big fan of these and own the extended editions this is simply weak and a kick in the pants. I can wait as blu rays are ridiculously expensive and I'm sure there they will get you as the extra content is going to up the price of the extended versions. I've got plenty of other movies to watch until this is done the right way with the extended versions made available.
1,Lord of the Rings wating for the Extended Editions,"I am in agreement; we will all go out and buy the regular edition, and a few months later Bam! Here the extended edition. I waited out the war between Blu Ray and HD Dvds, and will do the same here. Stop milking us."
1,Theatrical release on a film buff format?,"What were these people thinking? I bought a BluRay player when they were still $600. My entire collection is built around my love of film and my desire for special features. I actually supported HDDVD when the format wars started because, on average, they had way better special features. BluRay is a collector format currently. So why release the theatrical version? I agree with those crying foul saying that this is just a plan to squeeze another purchase out of confused customers."
1,Are You Guys Crazy???????????????,On what planet do you think people are going to purchase these and then 5 years later purchase the Extended blu ray editions?The differential in formats between bluray and dvd is not the same as VHS and DVD.I am more than happy watching my Lord Of the Rings on DVD extended edition.After all I paid 150.00 for them.I guarantee after seeing all the negative backlash about this blatant attempt at a screw job they will be announcing by February that it will include the extended edition.
1,Don't Waste your money,"Just another product for taking us money, why not the extended edition blue ray for this movie? Why they have to make us buy this Theatrical Editions again? Don't waste your money and wait for the exteded edition."
1,"Well, this looks like a nice big RIP OFF.","Can't believe New Line would stoop to pulling this. Why would I pay for anything but the extended editions? As a matter of fact, I wouldn't pay for anything else and I won't pay for anything else.This is absolutely heinous and not only won't I support it, I'll make sure to spread the word that you're out to gouge wallets in an ugly way."
1,Greedy studio scum,"Greedy studio scum. If the 1000+ 1 star reviews above aren't enough to clue you in then let me assist. The people do not want this theatrical only release. A theatrical/extended combined release would be great or releasing both at the same time. However, by just releasing the theatrical version is only showing off your incredible greed and ticking off your customers at the same time."
1,No More Double Dipping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The movies themselves are great and I have no problem with them releasing the theatrical versions on blu-ray. My problem is releasing the theatrical versions on blu-ray and then waiting to release the extended cut!!!!!!!!!! I say hold back the theatrical edition until the extended editions are done, or at the very least anounce the date and start running adds for the extended editions before the theatrical editions come out. I (like most people I think) am tired of getting suckered into buying 2 different editions of the same movie!!!!! That's our beef!!!!!!!!"
1,NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!,"I noticed Lord of The Rings was coming out on BluRay on April 6, 2010. ""Wow"", I thought, ""that's next week - pretty cool"". And for [...], it's not exactly a bank-breaker, either. Then, just as I was about to pre-order it, I noticed the single star rating. Huh? So I read some of the reviews and now I know why. I'm going to save my [...] and wait for the extended version to come out. This is just the existing version in BluRay format. Nothing to write home about. Even if the extended version comes out at something like $100, I'd still buy it. But not this version."
1,Do the movie execs think we're idiots???,"I am a HUGE LOTR fan, and like many bought the standard edition on DVD, then the extended. I AM NOT made of money, and WILL NOT do it again! Bring on the Extended Version, and I will pay my hard earned money for it. But NOT THIS!!!"
1,Rip Jip Joke,Like all the others I agree that this is a money making ploy. I will wait for the extended and not fall into the game they want to play. The extended versions are worth the wait.
1,Greedy Studios,"If you cannot wait, rent this one. Then buy the extended versions sure to follow. I went through this drill with DVD and won't do it again (studio execs, you listening?)"
5,Great Movies!,"These are my all time favorite movies! I do wish they wouldn't jerk the fans around and release the extended editions on Blu Ray first and stop making us have to buy 3 different sets, but I was dying to see it on Blu Ray and was willing to pay for an early look =)"
1,SHAMEFUL,This is shameful an inexcusable that the studio is not including the extended cut versions.
1,Buy the Extended Edition in November,Don't bother wasting your money on this. Just watch your upscaled DVD copies of the extended editions until the Bluray version is released in November. What a ripoff.
1,SICK OF YOUR GREED,"i am NOT going to buy this edition of LOTR. i am fed up with the way the studios continue to milk and bilk their customers. bring out the blu-ray extended version with the theatrical version and i may become a customer again. until then, FORGET IT. i suggest everyone boycott this release of the theatrical edition."
1,Fool Me No More; End Double-Dipping,"Read the other reviewers too! I am a collector and a fan, but I've lost count how many times I've rebought a title when variations are released. I for one will be happy when the cycle perpetrated by the studios is broken. This is my one-star review."
1,I refuse to buy 20 discs worth LOTR,"First off, I really do want the LOTR movies on Blu ray.But I'd really prefer if I didn't have to pay for the Digital copies and extra discs also. Every Blu Ray these days seems to be packaged with every frickin format just so your buying the same movie like three times. Like the movie Up, comes with a Blu Ray, and a special features disc, and DVD format, and Digital format, and VHS and 8mm is probably in there somewhere as well. This product will be coming with about 12 discs for three movies.And a year from now, they'll decide to release the Extended edition on Blu ray with another 15 discs so its kind of ridiculous. Seriously, they couldn't add the extended scenes? Of course they could, they just want to release the same movie in 20 different ways."
1,this is definately a rip off,"I am glad i read the other reviews b4 i made this mistake because I did not pay attention to the ""(Theatrical Editions + Digital Copy)"" part of the title."
1,Fool me twice...,I got suckered into buying the Theatrical release on DVD only to get find out that later they released the extended cut editions.. don't bother buying this until we have the extended cut out in blu-ray... until then enjoy the extended cut DVD upscaled on your blu-ray player.
3,"Great series, not so great condition","I bought this for my husband who loves these movies. He's a huge collector of this kind of stuff and he said he'd never own the movies unless he had the special extended edition. I bought these NEW and when I received them, the paper on the spine of the dvds was ripped in many locations. The corners were also stubbed up as well. The movies were perfect and he loves them, but he was very dissappointed by the condition of the set."
1,studio rip-off,"don't buy it. If you have to see it in HD, then rent it. Don't let the studio get you to buy it 4 times (if you bought both dvd's too)."
1,NEGATORY!! Bring out the Directors Cut!!,"I really hope that the powers that be are listening to all of us who have been anticipating the Blu release of the LOTR trilogy. WE WONT BE WAISTING OUR CASH ON THIS RELEASE!!We expect more than this release offers. Reward the fans with what they deserve - what they have already paid for in DVD format (twice for me). Quicken your pace, and get the EXTENDED EDITION to press ASAP. Its the edition that you're the most proud of, and that the tru fan-base loves. Thats why its referred to as the ""Director's Cut"", and thats why we demand it. So the only excuse for releasing something in Blu other that the best, is because you are greedy. Thats it. We know it. You know it. The Amazon Community is drumming it. Get it done.I hope the fan-base has the restraint to echo this same message. Don't spend twice again people :)"
1,There is no reason for them to be released like this...,I agree with everyone here that there is no reason for them to not release both the theatrical and extended versions in one package at the same time. It is absolutely a money grab by the studios. Bad form.
1,this shall not pass,"It's the director's cut or nothing. I can't wait to upgrade to blu ray, but not this version. I love the campaign."
1,I'll wait!,"I'm in total agreement with the other reviewers... don't waste your money on the theatrical versions, the extended versions are worth the wait."
1,Wait for Extended Release,Completely agree with the other reviewers! Wait for the extended release and save your money until then. If you are a LOTR fan the extended release is definitely worth the wait.
1,We want the Extended Version!,I most definitely agree with the others. True LOTR fans won't settle for less than the extended version. A couple of monthe is worth the wait.
1,DO NOT BUY...BUY EXTENDED,No LOTR fan would buy this...total milkage.Haven't you made enough New Line?
1,"5 Stars for LOTR, 1 Star for Blu-Ray Release","We want both versions of the films, but if not possible then at least make the extended cut of the film available. With this economy, is it necessary to milk fans double times in order to get both versions of the film?The movie itself I give 5 stars but seeing the kinds of decisions being made on both the release of the picture is disappointing"
2,"""Stop complaining...""","All of you who that are complaining about this blu-ray are the one's who purchased this set, come on admit it. Blu-ray 50GB has the room to fit both versions- absolutely right, no argument there. But the fans will never be satisfied. We all knew that this set would be the theatrical editions many months in advance. I had a chance to see this set, and The Fellowship... is a really inferior transfer, but I borrowed the set from a friend who received this for from WB for an advanced review. I will not by this until both versions are available together. The Two..., and The Return... do look promising. A nice step up from the DVD versions. Just remember that blu-ray is still a new format, and we almost certain will not get what we want all the time. Just think in a few short years everything from CD, DVD, Blu-ray, and 3D Blu-ray will make way for digital downloads. It's coming sooner than you think."
1,Lord of the Rings Trilogy Blu Ray,I hate how they put our the theatrical version first. We have waited long enough for this to come out on blu ray. Release the extended and theatrical version together. Haven't you guys made enough money of of these movies!
1,Hold off for the Extended Versions,"Like the other reviewers said, why throw your $$ away? The extended versions are so much better. Wait until the extended version release."
1,"Very bad business move, New Line!","Along with many others, I am sick of the tactics of New Line. I was hoping to see the extended version in Blu before I wound up in a retirement home with no hearing and poor eyesight. At this rate, I doubt I'll even be alive! Fans would be much more loyal if New Line wasn't so unethical in their business practices. I'm not even sure I'll go see The Hobbit now; I'm just too angry. Maybe I'll cool off by the time it comes out. Shame on you New Line; hope the economy eats you alive!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Lord of the rings Platinum Special extended edition,"I loved it, it was everything I had hoped that I would see in the theater release. I didn't even go see Return of the King, because I was so disappointed with what I saw in the first two. I only became interested when I saw all the videos on YouTube, and realized New Line must have filmed and released them. The extra appendices were great too!"
5,Good Buy,"Awesome collection of this masterpiece, lord of the rings set as all available behind the scenes and extra we want, and the movie with extended version, what more can you want?"
5,Pretty slick,So far we've watched the first movie. The extra footage is great and holds true to the books. I would recommend this for any fan of LOTR.
1,Waiting until Extended Edition is released,"No point in releasing (or buying) the theatrical, heavily edited editions of an incredible trilogy. Waiting until the extended versions are released on Bluray."
1,Was it really too difficult to include 'both' versions..?,"Buyer beware! For all of the boasting about how much a single Blu-ray disc can store, here we are with 'only' the (Theatrical Editions) of ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. The (Extended Editions) are without a doubt the best versions to own, and by not including them here confirms that this is nothing more than just a blatant cash grab. Safe your money for the eventual release of the (Extended Editions) in 2011."
1,Extended Version Required,I will be first on the block to buy the extended version. TAKE MY MONEY !!!
1,Studio Greed Strikes Again,Just adding my two cents worth of this Bluray release. While I dearly love the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy I refuse to buy this release. It is shameful the way the studios try to bleed customers dry with multiple releases of the same movie. Everyone knows about the extended versions and that is what most people want. Why not release a complete set that has both versions? I would be willing to pay slightly more for that than be screwed into buying two different sets. Then the studios whine and complain about rampant piracy. Is it any wonder? Piracy is a two way street you hypocrites.
1,"Agreed... if you're gonna do Blu-Ray, do it right!","If there is going to be a Blu-Ray release, let's get it right the first time and release the full-length version. Money-grubbing studios!!!!"
1,Will Wait For Extended,"Already have extended on DVD. Why waste money on theatrical version Blu-ray. While I'm at it, how 'bout hurrying up with the ""Harry Potter"" ultimate extended editions."
4,The movie is still great but why keep buying new ones,"Man you gotta be kindin' me! Another one. Don't get me wrong I'm not complaining except for the fact I've bought the extended already. My brother bought both versions of each films. This has got to be one of the best marketing schemes in history. In my option they are pumping more money out of fans and that ain't right. If you don't have either version, get them, if you spent the money buying the ones that came last year, keep your money in your pocket, but I guess most of you probably knew that. For those of you looking for a review of the films, you ain't gettin' here, this is just a comment and opinion on the new releases, so I know you'll mark it down that this wasn't helpful to you. For a review I would say that all three of these films are some of the best films in history and I'm going to go watch them right now."
1,Why even bother with this?,How disappointing to see it only has the theatrical versions. The extended versions were much better and really the only ones worth owning. And you KNOW the studio will eventually release the extended versions on BD. Buying the theatrical versions is just a waste of money. Skip this version and wait for the extended version.
1,"Not Extended, No Thanks","There's really no excuse for not having the extended editions on Blu Ray. As others have noted, this product is largely a waste of money for you the consumer."
1,Lets see the extended versions already!,This wait is obnoxious. There is no way I am going to buy the theatrical release.
1,Another Angry LOTR Fan!!!!,"I like many others who love this movie paid to go see it in the theater. We paid again when it came out on DVD. We paid AGAIN when it came out on DVD extended version. It's bad enough we had to wait this long to finally see the movie in Blu-Ray, but I WILL NOT BUY IT TWO MORE TIMES!!!!!"
3,grrrr,"I can't give it an accurate review because I just bought it from Amazon as a gift for my daughter, so needless to say I haven't seen it yet. But, I just came across the same set for $10.00 less on tower.com. So, I'm alittle disappointed already...=/"
1,Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"I like the trilogy but I am waiting for a replacement set as the second DVD (The Two Towers) is defective. Any chance of getting the new set soon? If not for that problem, I would rate the trilogy 5 stars."
4,quit whining.....,"It really doesn't bother me that the initial Blu-ray release is going to be the theatrical cuts only.I own the standard DVD versions of the extended cuts and they are great. But sometimes I wish I also had the theatrical versions also, they are less of a time commitment. Now I will have them on Blu-ray.If you don't want these versions, don't buy them. Wait awhile longer for the inevitable release of the longer cuts...."
2,Nothing special,"The first movie was great, the second was ok, and the third one was awful. So, the series sucks."
1,"I'm waiting, I've already spent enough on this series",I'm in total agreement with all the other reviews I've read so far. This is just total greed from the studio. If they are that interested in making extra money charge twice the price and do them by pre-order only. I'm sure they would still sell more copies that way. I have both Theatrical and Extended editions of the trilogy as well as the later extended edition they released on one disk so you didn't have to change it out in the middle of the movie. Enough of these editions no one really wants. I'll just watch my DVD's up-converted till they put the extended blu-ray out. If you have to see it on blu-ray rent don't buy so the studio gets the message.
1,I will not be buying this.,"As badly as I have wanted to get these movies on Blu-ray, I will absolutely not give a penny for this. I can't believe they are trying to milk a faithful audience for every dime they can. Maybe when the Extended version comes out they will get my money. This is shameless. I guess they caught whatever greed disease George Lucas is running around with."
1,"Like everyone else, it's too bad this is how Warners treats its fans.",Dupe dupe dupe. Wish this was a New Line release and not something Big Daddy was working on instead. Just wait everyone. It's time to halt practices like this.
1,Why??,It's a Blu-ray disc! Aren't blu-ray discs supposed to have the ability to have more information on one disc than a normal dvd? Why not just put both versions of the movie on one disc? One disc for each movie of course. But to release them separately once again is just stupid.
1,No way,"I've purchased this three times on DVD, for various versions of the movie and exclusive to each edition bonus materials, and not about to buy the theatrical again, without the extended available.You all know they will, sooner or later, release the extended edition as well, and are just trying to scrape more money off gullible people. If you're not a moron, don't buy it, take a stand against money grabbing corporation."
1,The choice should be ours,"Someone was aruging that they favored the theatrical version vs. the extended. That's fine. That's their choice. But for those who prefer the extended version, they should be able to get what they want as well. The choice should be ours and not the movie studios! Where is the extended version?!?!? The option should be ours now."
1,One edition to fool them all..,"One edition to fool them all, one edition to fine them. Extended edition to sting them all and in the greediness mine them."
2,I'll be waiting for the extended,"Love the movies and I'm excited to get these on bluray, however there's no reason this shouldn't have the extended versions, so I will wait until they come out to buy."
1,No Extended Version - zero stars,I would have voted zero stars. but one is the lowest I can go. I will forego the theatrical and buy the extended and vote with my billfold.
1,Release the Exteneded Version on Blu-Ray ASAP!,Please release the Extended Versions. Like many others I have been waiting for the Blu-Ray release for some time. I already own the Extended DVD's and would buy the Extended Blu-Ray right now. I will not settle for this version.
1,6 coaster set,"So here's the disc breakdown:- 3 discs blu-ray (one for each film)- 3 discs old dvd extras- 3 discs of digital copies (one for each film)By my count, that's 6 useless and unnecessary discs that would go in the trash. Sure, I'd rather have the extended versions, although there is some worth in the theatrical editions so wouldn't necessarily turn them away. But charging MSRP of $100 for 3 blu-ray discs is highway robbery - just ridiculous. Even with a discount it's still a rip off, considering there's no real value added content. Whoever greenlit this release plan for the LOTR blu-rays is an idiot that doesn't know their job. Skip this pathetic cash-grab and enjoy your LOTR dvds for now instead."
1,poor business practice,This is without a doubt just a way to milk us for us every penny we have. I will not be supporting this blu-ray edition. You should not either.
1,Fool Me Once,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. No thanks. I'll wait for the blu-ray Extended Edition (EE). Forever, if need be.I have the DVD EE of [what I consider to be] the greatest movie ever made. And it upconverts nicely to a very good picture.Do I blame the studios? No. They are doing what corporate mentality is suppose to do. Take as much of your money as is possible and let the buyer beware.In this instance however, I would like to see a planet-wide boycott of this ""rip"" release.Even if you don't care about the money, care about the cause.Can we all pull together on this one? We shall see?Don't buy this standard edition release. If you do, shame on you!"
1,We demand the extened edition!,I think that this is a rip-off deal. I love the movie but I will not buy this version. I want the Extended Edition! They have had plenty of time to produce both and release at the same time. They should give the people the choice to which they want to purchase.
1,It is time to say NO MORE.,Lets call this exactly what it is; PURE GREED. I cannot believe the greed of the movie studios to release only the Theater version of the Lord of the Rings in Blu-Ray at this time. This great movie deserves the Gone With The Wind treatment and the full extended versions to be released NOW. Do not be duped into buying the Theater version; you will regret it later. It is time to raise your DVD Players high and say NO MORE.
1,Not happy,I waited about 5 weeks and never received the DVD's I ordered. I did get my money back with no hassel but wasted a lot of time going to my mail box and checking everyday.
1,"Do NOT buy this version, wait for the Extended Version","Yes, LOTR is an AWESOME movie, but not releasing the Extended Version and instead releasing the crippled theatrical version is just plain greedy from the studios.Send the message to the studios, we are not dumb, the Internet allows us to communicate and know about these things so that other people don't make the same mistake."
1,I'll wait too,"Nothing more to say, they can keep their Theatrical version only, I'm just sad that they will sell many anway..."
1,Up to their old dirty tricks,"Theatrical Editions? As long as we've been waiting for the Blu-ray, you'd think they'd skip their silly games and include the Extended versions. I know the economy is bad, but if they hope to make money with this, they could do a lot better by giving what everybody wants--Most of us awaiting the Blu-ray are not buying anything less than the Extended version. Surely they're are aware of that! Why waste everybody's time and even more of their OWN money? People nowdays are just too well informed for these dirty old tricks to work any more."
1,Add another to the list,"Make room on the party wagon for yet another person who fell for the double dip with the DVD editions. Why would anyone in their right mind buy the Theatrical editions on Blu-Ray when we all only want the Extended Editions. I will hold out as long as it takes but trust me, once the Extended Edition on Blu-Ray comes out, I am ordering that thing in 1 second...yes..really..1 second.. :) Here's hoping they realize their mistake and we don't have to wait too too long.Oh and for the record...I'm not big on the whole 1-star review to complain about something like this but this time I really felt it had to be done."
1,Extended Edition,I'll toss my hat in as yet another person whom bought both the normal and extended editions on DVD. I won't be making that mistake again.
1,I'll buy multiple copies of the LOTR trilogy,"once they release it in the fullness of their extended cuts. I have no qualms with the studio trying to make as much money as possible. This is a country that embraces free enterprise. I post this review to make it painfully clear to the very same studio that there is strong demand, and therefore a vested economic interest for WB, to release the extended edition blu-ray trilogy asap."
1,Studio Greed!,"No Shame. Corporate Greed at its best. For Details See Review posted by C. BURNS ""The Dude"""
1,Lucaslike greed,"Unfortunately Jackson has done this ""whatever the market will bear"" philosophy with LOTR and King Kong. Hard to fault the films he makes though. He is a master. (I am sorry that my one star might be interpreted as pertaining to the quality of the films. The films are five star. And btw: you can now purchase each individual film on Blu ray for anywhere from $5 to $10. And the Extended version trilogy set is great, although it does Not have the theatrical versions included."
1,Theater ? Am I reading this right?,To me this is a ripoff since the sale of the extended version (on DVD) surpassed the theatrical version. Why not publishing the extended edition with the 'theatrical version' in the same package? May other company did before. I would not recommend you people wasting money on this version.. wait for the extended edition! This will worth the wait!
1,LOTR BluRay,"Absolutely no way I am buying the Theatrical Versions on Blu Ray. I hope they rot on the shelves, I'm waiting for the Extended Editions, I will watch my exisiting DVD Extended Editions until then."
1,35 dollars more than buying the individual Blu-Rays? Fail!,"I won't talk about the merits of this vs the extended version, but I dont get why Amazon is pricing it 35 dollars more than buying the individual Blu-Rays? That's nearly double for exactly the same thing. Fail!"
1,"Lord of the Rings, Bend over and take it deep edition","I've seen the movies at least 20 times each in theaters, bought both versions of the dvd's and bought all of the video games. So Newline repays the loyal fans by expecting us to buy the blurays twice? No thanks."
1,Lost Sale Again,Now they have missed christmas 2010 sales for Blu Ray Extended. Economy is doing bad would have been a good boost for their profits and secondly gives the consumer 12+ hours of entertainment. Idiots.
1,The worst buying in Amazon,"I pre ordered this item, and was previously announced wihtin portuguese subtitles.I receiced the package last week, and form my surprise the BDs doesn't have the portuguese subtitles.And another bad surprise when I checked the item back at Amazon, to see these details, the product description announced was changed.Now here, in Brazil, is not possible to return the item, or to sell it aorund. The thing is stucked in my hands.Shame on Amazon, never saw this happening before."
1,"Wow, you can actually feel the anger...",Way to go Warner Brothers! Set the community on fire and watch it burn. One can only hope the studio produced a crap load of these and gets stuck with a marginal profit line. Its unfortunate that a loss is truly wishfull thinking. Because thats just about the only thing that will teach you a lesson.I will vote with my wallet and wait for the extended edition. Its too bad your mostly hurting the middle men involved in wholesale and retail. I hope they can get their money back for any unsold product. Because you can see this release tanking in price real quick as stock piles up.In a month you will be able to pick this turd of a release up for 20 bucks or less.
1,BOOOO on them,They should take the Theatrical Versions and bury them in the desert next to those ET Atari games.
1,+1 DO NOT Buy until Extended,"Come on NewLine, you already made your money with the DVD and theatre sales - now you want to milk us (again) for the blu-ray theatrical AND extended sets SEPARATELY? Correct me if I'm wrong, but blu-ray should hold ALL these, extra features and with room to spare!!"
1,I call shenanigans on New Line (now part of Warner Bros),"Those monkeys are going to lose money on this one. Only true fans would buy this on BluRay, and no true fan would buy anything but the extended editions. So those idiots will incur all the costs of production, packaging, and shipping, but nobody will purchase save for grandparents mistakenly buying this for their progeny. Great move in a shaky economy. Ain't nobody buying this one fools."
1,Just Wait a little longer,As everyone says don't take the bait. The extended editions will be out shortly for the same price.
1,pathetic greed,dont let the studio execs buy another boat with your money- wait for the extended version
1,"No, no and no !!!",Like many others I'm in love with this trilogy. But without the extended versions I refuse to buy this product.
1,Such greed!,"I too love the LOTR movies, but don't love what the studio is doing trying to get us to buy this movie over and over again. Extended Version Bluray is what should ethically be released at this point. Seriously just HOW MUCH money must you make from these films?"
1,I am boycotting this realease,I think Lord of thr rings is my all time favorite movie and I cannot wait to see it on blu ray. However the extended version is much better and captures much more of the story from the books. I am boycotting this release and wating for the extended version.Save your money.
1,"Come on New Line, Don't play this game.","Fool me once with the standard def DVDs, but not again with Blu-Rays. We all know the Extended Editions will be out less than a year after this standard set. The extended editions are the most popular ones, so why release the standard editions only. Just make both editions available on the same 2 disc set for each movie and price accordingly. This is pure money grabbing at its finest. Peter Jackson is turning into George Lucas. What's next, a special extended-extended edition with new effects?"
1,Hold out for the extended versions...,"This is a fantastic trilogy for sure but come on... No extended versions??? If anything, put the extended and theatrical in the same release. This is a 100% attempt to soak the consumer twice. Shame on you New Line. Don't play this game with the studio; just wait for the extended versions to come out on Blu-Ray. This release gets a huge raspberry!"
1,Not Falling For It....,"I am just like any other Joe that loves these movies. So with that being said, why it the h*ll am I going to pay for it on blue ray if I am not going to get the extended cut...Don't bother me also with crummy transfers...I WILL pay for the extended cut, when they release it. So yes I am trying to send a message with the rest of the people on here rating... DON'T BE GREEDY!"
1,Stop milking the fans,"The movies rule, but this corporate way to take away the money from the fans isn't fair, I saw that happen with the theatrical versions on DVD, wich by the the way I didn't buy. They just want to squeeze the movies to get every possible penny from us. We just have to wait 'till the extended versions, meanwhile there are lots of movies worth our money."
1,Shameful,Just contributing to the low star rating that should help ward customers away from this swindle.
3,"visually awesome but thats about it, this isn't tolkein's lord of the rings","great visual effects, but the movie is nothing like the book. they changed huge portions, skipped others and even changed the personalities of the characters....very hard to watch i guess if you are a fan of the book, the movie by itself i guess is ok, nothing special to me."
1,Less than 1?,"I agree with the majority of the other 2,600 comments (I did not read all of them) that this is a rip off. Ever since I first heard that they were going to be releasing LOTR on Blu-Ray (about 1 year now) I have that it was ridiculous that they planned on releasing the theatrical version first and then holding out for the extended. I am a huge fan of the series, both movie & book, and could quote the movie to you in my sleep, I own several editions of this already and while I am eager to own it in high def-I refuse to purchase this. It is nothing but a gimmick and I am disappointed that they are repeating themselves."
1,"Greedy, Greedy, Greedy","Of course they assume we can't wait for the extended version, so they'll try to double dip --- I won't be buying the theatrical and don't want to encourage their greed."
1,Of course this was released first!,"Anyone who's seen the Extended Versions and then has gone back to watch the Theatrical Versions realizes that the story seems full of holes. The only reason this is being released is, as others have said, to squeeze every dollar out of the fans of this movie series that they can. Like others, I own all three movies, both Extended and Theatrical. This time, though, the only one I'll own on BluRay is the Extended Version."
2,Waiting for extended edition!,"I have been waiting for LOTR and Star Wars to come out on blu-ray for a long time! I have the extended edition of the LOTR DVD's and I still watch them quite frequently. I play them on my PS3, so the picture quality is quite good even though it's not 1080p. I think I can wait a little longer. As tempting as it is to buy this, I think I will only get frustrated because I am used to watching the extended versions - so I'll feel like something has been cut out."
1,DON'T BUY THIS VERSION !!!!!!!!,Please wait for the extended version to be released. This version is totally incomplete!!!!!
1,Say no to the studio greed!!!,adding my voice to the others here. I WILL NOT BE DUPED INTO BUYING THE THEATRICAL VERSION WHILE I KNOW THE EXTENDED VERSION IS AROUND THE CORNER. Stop playing with us WB. We are not dumb. We know you can fit both versions on 1 bluray disk.
3,"I wont buy this, I want the EXTENDED editions",please new line. give us the extended versions. I will pay more for those. I will not buy this.
3,Another Vote For Extendeds,I Also Agree I want the Extended Versions...I LOVE the movies but I think I'll Wait for the Extendeds...so I give em a 3.....but the movies themselves a 5!!
3,Lord or the Rings,"The theatric releases are good,but the extended ones are great! Come on New Line release both versions, because i'll only buy the extended ones!"
5,The difinitive trilogy since Star Wars.,"Not since the Star Wars trilogy has there been such a monumental film series. While much critisism has been focused on the theatricle versions of the film (the ones presented in this box set), it is my personal belief that extended versions are in no way supperior to their edited counterparts. There is a legitimate reason why the films were trimmed down (could The Return of the King get any longer?). If you watch the films (both theatrical and extended eddition) you will realize that the latter are indeed paced better. The release of this set is all too convienent; in fact it comes out the day I get out of school (wink wink, mom, if you reading this). It sure would make a supurb ""out-of-school"" gift (wink, wink)"
1,No more,as you can tell.. i agree.. stop being so greedy. i want this in blu-ray.. but the good copy and both in dvd.. willing to pay
1,Do not be fooled!,This product is an ugly way to steal money from consumers. Wait until the full version of these films are out on Blu-Ray and show New Line Cinema that you are not a fool.
1,not again!!!,I CANNOT believe the studios pulled this stunt. Again. Somebody on Amazon predicted the owners of LOTR would do this being the greedy sneaks that they are. Cut it out and put both versions on one Blu-Ray! You guys will complain when people simply go out and get bootleg copies and wonder why. There are many loyal fans and honest people but don't be surprised when it happens.
1,"One star review for the product, not the movie","Like many others here, I'm fed up with movie studios ripping off customers. 99% of us support them thru attending theatres and buying the movies legally (Blu-Ray, DVD, digital, online, etc.). Granted, 1% are guilty of pirating and it costs the studios $$. But that is NO excuse to take advantage of legitimate consumers.If a movie has been or is expected to have additional footage incorporated into an ""Extended Version"" or ""Director's Cut"", the studios should include both the original theatrical version AND the extended/director's version on Blu-Ray.Only by choosing NOT to buy until the studio releases discs with BOTH versions available can we stop this ongoing rip-off."
1,Movie studios screwing us over again,"I bought 1 each of the original theatrical versions of the films on DVD. EACH time, I thought ""There's no way that the studios are releasing an extended version of this one since they are releasing the 'theatrical' version now"". Guess what!? They did! So they got double the money from me (and countless others)!! What a rip-off. I got rid of the original version and only kept the extended versions. WHY would anyone other than some collector want both? Why would the studios NOT release both at the same time so that those who want the theatrical version can buy it and those that want the extended version can buy that one? MONEY, GREED, and DECEIT. That's all.This is a bad product. I'll wait until they release the extended versions on Blu-Ray. If they don't--then at least they aren't suckering me in for more money."
1,Bored of the Sting!,"Of course a business like New Line is going to try to make money. That's what businesses do. They do this to employ people. They do this to feed their kids. They do this so that little Jimmy (age 5) can have no less than 3 platinum toothbrush holders, and 4 diamond encrusted lunch boxes. Do you want to be responsible for Ashley's haveing to to use Coach suitcases instead of LV when she goes to her gold plated summer camp this year? I don't. I'm buying both copies. God Bless America! Now that's Sarcasm!!"
1,An Embarrassment,"No extended edition? What are they thinking? Oh, yeah. Money. That's all they care about."
1,Hey NEW LINE ... ever heard of branching?? I know you have ...,"I will also join the movement not to purchase the BluRay LOTR discs until they are released in Extended version, but wish they had just made a branching version -- it is NOT AT ALL difficult. I *might* rent this with a FREE rental to check out the quality, but I'm betting I'll enjoy the Extended Edition DVD unconverted better despite the lack of pixels. It was a stunning transfer (probably the best ever for DVD) ... even blown up on my 120"" screen. So I can remain happy about that ... but, it is typical of the money-grubbing studios these days. Look at this farce they're pulling with the new hidef rentals stripped of ALL (not even chapter selection on some) features. We need a campaign there too. But I digress ..."
1,"Agree with 2,500+ others",Come on New Line.. You know what you are doing. Your trying to sell everyone 2 different versions of these great movies to make even more money off us. I'm not buying these movies 4 times. I have patience. I will wait you out!!!DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Wait for the good stuff (extended edition Blu-Ray.
1,"Not extended edition version. Will wait, crooks.","How much money do these people need? I waited the first time for the extended edition DVD's. This bluray is not extended, and they will not get any of my hard earned money!"
1,Hold out for the EXTENDED Trilogy Blu-ray,Let this edition collect dust on the store shelves people. Don't buy this. Hold out for the Extended Edition.
1,Save your money and wait!,"Sure, WB would love for you to be impatient and buy this now, then buy again when they release the full versions.Don't fall for their tricks, and just wait!"
1,Double-dipping again!,The movie studio is doing it again by releasing the theatrical editions now thinking that avid fans will flock to purchase this product and then capitalize on that impulsivity by releasing the extended editions a year later. It seems that New Line is taking advice from Lucasfilm these days.
1,A Shameless Ploy To Get Extra Money From Fans,"Releasing only the theatrical edition first is just a shameless ploy to get extra money from fans. They're betting on the fact that people want to see this so much on Blu-ray that we'll buy it twice. Well, I DO want to see it on Blu-ray, but out of principle I will NOT buy this until the extended edition is released."
1,Just another Ploy,"I have to admit, I was excited to find out that there was a Blu-ray version coming out until i found out that it's not the extended version. I have the extended version on dvd and i'm hoping that the extended comes out soon on bluray, i'm not going to purchase until then."
1,Wait for Extended or Dual editions,"Like everyone else here, wait for the extended edition unless you the fan that wants both versions."
1,Money Money Money,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I bought the original DVD theatrical editions only to later hear the extended editions were coming. So they got me twice back then. Now I have a new purchasing philosophy, wait at least six months if not a year after a new release before buying. Usually the extended or ultimate or unrated or enhanced version will appear in the rumor mills by then if it is coming."
1,"Yeah....I Don't Think So, New Line","I'm throwing my vote in as well. They should have known better than try to push this theatrical-only version on us when we've already tasted the majesty of the extended versions. This is one of those moments when I wish I was a fly on the wall when these people were making these decisions, just so I could determine if there was even a hint of intelligence in the conversations. Fail."
1,What a rip off!!! Get a clue studios!,"Hey guys don't fall for this crap!Not only did they release these great movies about 99 times on DVD but now they want to milk blu ray owners. Ugh, avoid and wait for the extended editions.I hate greedy studios!"
1,"Big fan, but I too will not support this..","Yes I am a huge LotR fan but I will not be suckered into buying 2 versions again. As with the original dvd's I jumped on every theatrical dvd release and then repurchased the extended editions. I felt cheated and the theatrical release DVD's became absolutely worthless (I just gave them to friends).Well, no more. I will wait for 10 years if need be but I will not spend a penny on this version of LotR on BluRay.My DVD ext ed's will serve me just fine until the BluRay version is released.... even if it's 2011"
1,Not a chance!,"I do not own a blue-ray disc or machine. That said...if there was one movie I would want in blue-ray its ""The Lord of the Rings"" but, don't think i would for a second buy this without it being the extended edition, I really like Lord of the Rings and when it comes out in the extended cut I am thinking of getting a machine and the blue-ray version. Till then I'll wait why end up spending the money, when they really should have put the two versions together........To bad I think they made a big mistake here."
1,Not sure I want to wait for the extendeds,I really want the extendeds but am not sure I will be willing to pay what they will end up charging for them. Something tells me the reason they are releasing the theatricals is because the extended version will be in some super deluxe box that they will charge well over $100 for. As much as I like these movies I am not paying that much for an hour of extra footage at best.
1,"Ok, fine, milk money, but just release the extended editions soon, ok? I'm not paying for this.","Nice one, Warner.. you know many fans don't have an option, they will curse your greediness and still buy this, out of fear that it may take years to get the Extended Editions out on blu-ray. Just get this over with and release the EE:s soon. Too bad in the meanwhile thousands will be buying this ""crippled"" set and get disappointed."
1,Guess I'll Keep waiting,"So let me get this straight, we've waited all this time for this amazing box set to be announced and available for order, and we don't even get the full versions of the movies?! Whats the point of using Blu-Ray if they're not going to utilize all the space on the disk. No thank you!!Please keep voicing your opinions on this by voting 1 star and writing a demand for the REAL versions. Amazons reviews can be a powerful thing, so keep them coming."
1,Greed at its' worst...,"Maybe now that the buying public is finally on to the stupid studio ploys to trick customers into ""multi-buys"", when this thing doesn't sell, we can get a ""real"" package. Heck we've waited this long, what's another few months until they release the extended versions, anyways?DON'T DO IT! CORPORATE FILM COMPANIES TRYING TO TAKE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY THROUGH TRICKERY...!"
1,why dont you listen to us?,"I dont get it... Seriously... even after a release date delay they are still going through with making the theartical versions available 1st. What happened to giving legendary films like this the 5 star treatment like Wizard of OZ got? Common guys I think the voices of the consumer have spoken and spoken quite loudly ""Extended cut or no go""... Stop being greedy and give the fans who put food on your tables what we really want and thats the extended cuts!! I seriously hope the greed of this company backfires on them and they loses money on production cost since these items wont sell."
1,wait for the extended versions,"If the movie studio wasn't so greedy, they'd release the extended version at the same time and let people choose.Originally, the extended version came later-- but now both versions exist, and the buyer should get to choose.my2"
1,"I agree, give us the extended version now because you will not sell this standard set!",I agree with everyone else in that it is ridiculous to release this awesome movie in the theatrical version and not the extended. They think we will be so gullible to buy this one now and then the extended one in two years? I think not. Save your money on this and force them to release the extended one now!
1,Release both versions now. Don't buy this release!!!,I'm in complete agreement with the other one star reviews. Blu Ray has the capacity to give us both versions on one disk so the only reason to release the theatrical versions without extended directors cut is just to gouge us out of a few bucks.Don't buy this release!!!
1,Add my voice...,"I'm adding my voice to those expressing their disappointment with the projected release of the Blu-Ray DVD without the extended editions. I, like so many others, will wait until the extended edition is released on Blu-Ray before shelling out the money. If no extended edition Blu-Ray is released, then too bad, you won't get my money."
1,Was going to buy it... then saw 1 star rating...,"I did not even know there was extended version, but I guess I should wait for it then... Thanks guys for heads up!"
1,I will wait for extended,"I really want the LOTR series on blu-ray but I will wait for the extended version. The words ""milking it"" comes to mind.On another note - why does Amazon let people review a product that hasn't been released yet?"
1,REALLY????,"If there was an option for ""no star"" I would have chosen that over the most generous ""1 star""...REALLY??? I would not waste my hard earned money on the theatrical, and neither should anyone else..I will be happy with my extended dvd's until they are released on BluRay. Shame on you for taking advantage of all of us Ringers.."
5,Read the books first,"This trilogy is the greatest set of movies ever based on the greatest set of books ever. As many people said, before and after the movies were released, it would be impossible to bring every facet of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece to life in a movie but this rendition is the best anyone could ever do in my opinion. Yes, events from the books are left out even in the extended versions and some events and characters are even changed because of the reality of trying to turn a thousand page book into 9 or 10 hours of movie. I mean, how many people could read all three books in even twice the time it takes to watch all 3 of the extended films? Everything from the books simply could not be put into any kind of feasible movie-and the purists should simply get over it and find something better to complain about."
3,"Great movie/Bad scam,","I own theatrical/extended, both are great, but the extended makes this movie. I did not rate this 1 star because the movie is too good for that :) I'm still getting this though, as it comes out on my birthday.EDIT: I think EVERYONE should stop rating it 1 star. You think a bunch of reviews on an online retailer is going to stop the producers from being greedy?"
1,What's the point? I already have these.,"Really! They've already been released. Better if you get the regular extended edition.However, It's nice that the extended editions are on one disc. But it's already been done!The picture is sooooo dark, And the sound at times is muffled. Plus, the subbies are hideous (like when Gollum says ""My... precious... ah....."" in the beginning of TTT it says ""My...Precious...RING !"" and I never watch ti with captions anyway but I just wanted to see what it was like.)Don't waste your money."
3,Why Not Both?,"The other night I watched part of The Two Towers broadcast in HD on my brothers 52"" XBR -- WOW! it looked great. So this announcement is good news in and of itself, but I agree with the chorus of fans who think we should have both the Theatrical & the Extended versions in this release.Actually I like the opening of the theatrical version of Fellowship more than than the extended one (I find the editing more interesting) HOWEVER...The extended versions of Two Towers and Return of the King are markedly superior to the theatrical releases as to be different movies.I am tempted...but I will wait for the extended."
1,rip off,Once again an attempt is being made to make money off unsuspecting people to buy two versions of the movie. Don't do it; wait for the extended release.
1,I would buy ... but not both versions,"I have to agree with all 2,000+ fellows who voted with one star. I will buy the HD version only when the extended versions are published. Before that they won't get my money!"
1,Why why why??,"If they think that people will fall for the same trick twice they are wrong. Why not release the extended version rightaway ? This is just profit-making at its worst.First they released the theatrical versions on DVD, then much later the extended ones (just for Christmas every year if I remember correctly). And now the same with the blu-ray?You can excuse the DVD-release in order that Jackson had not finished the extended versions yet, but this time it's all there - so why do this ????I am really thinking about not buying any of the blu-ray editions!!!"
2,poor,There's a major part to the movie cut out. The movie cuts out before they light the beacons that Gondor calls for aid straight through until the ghost army comes out of the mountain to assist Aragorn.
1,Don't buy this Blu-ray.,Don't Buy standard Edition. Waite for Extended edition.Don't Buy standard Edition. Waite for Extended edition.Don't Buy standard Edition. Waite for Extended edition.Don't Buy standard Edition. Waite for Extended edition.Don't Buy standard Edition. Waite for Extended edition.Don't Buy standard Edition.

Waite for Extended edition.Don't Buy standard Edition. Waite for Extended edition.Don't Buy standard Edition. Waite for Extended edition.
1,Let this also serve as a warning to George Lucas,"Great movie, short-sighted business practices.I am content to view my existing DVD (theatrical & extended versions) until New Line Cinema decides to produce & distribute the extended versions on blu-ray. I'd prefer this packaged with the theatrical version, but my purchasing $$ will wait for extended version at minimum.As a side note, I won't be conned into buying multiple blu-ray versions from other franchises famous for multiple versions either. Hopefully the Star Wars/Star Trek studios take note.C Burns ""The Dude""... my hat is off to you."
1,Theatrical editions equal no purchase for me,"DONT BUY THIS!When we get both theatrical and extended versions in the collection, I will purchase. Until then, this is a rip off. Trying to make money by making us buy this set and then a year later another set with the extended versions as well.No cash for you! I said, NO CASH!"
1,What The Deuce?,It was my understanding that one of the beauties of Blu-ray was the amount of info you can fit on a disc...Come on people you can put both the theatrical and extended versions in one nice package. This is just another case of greed.
1,Give us the choice with a concurrent release date!,"The Lord of the Rings is a wonderfully done movie, in both theatrical release length, and extended versions. Since both versions have been released previously, why can't the studio allow us to choose which version we wish to buy in the Blu-ray format by releasing both versions in separate editions at the same time? I can understand a separate release in the initial progression of marketing the movie, with the 'director's cut' or 'extended version' being developed at a later time. But, now that they both are in the can and the public already has a preference for the version they like, let us purchase the version we want without a studio dictated waiting period for one version or the other!"
1,Waiting for extended version.,"I am also holding out until the extended blu ray version is released. If they never release it, that's ok, as I already have the extended dvd, but I will not buy another 2 blu ray sets. The studio must think we're all idiots!!!"
1,EXTENDED VERSION is the BEST VERSION. This 'Theatrical' version is USELESS!!,"Once you have the EXTENDED VERSIONS of the LOTR trilogy, you realise that the theatrical versions are not as good and missing too many good scenes. To come out with a theatrical version on Blu Ray is a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. As owner of the EXTENDED EDITIONS on DVD, I will not buy any LOTR movie on BLU RAY until in the EXTENDED EDITION.HOW STUPID!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not buy this product. They will release the extended versions later, they just want your money (the studio, not amazon). BOOOOOO! Two thumbs waaay down for releasing this slap in the face product."
1,LOTR Theatrical version,I will NOT spend $70 on the theatrical version--I hope this was not Peter Jacksons decision.Just give us the extended--NOW!
1,"Sorry, New Line. I hope this release bombs!","Big mistake, boys.BIG mistake!Other than sheer corporate greed, or a need to validate P.T. Barnum's claim that a sucker is born every minute, there is no excuse for not releasing the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings on Blue-ray.I have eagerly awaited the release of these films on Blue-ray. But NOT the theatrical editions. Now I will have to settle for the pleasure in knowing that I am one among countless fans who will not spend a penny on these versions. In fact, I will prbobably not even RENT these discs until New Line does the right thing, by releasing the EXTENDED editions on Blue-ray.I urge everyone else to do the same. Someone will feed these corporate weasels. But it won't be me!"
2,Why should anyone buy these?,"I cannot give this one star because the movies are so great, but why should anyone buy this set when the majority of us want the theatrical AND extended versions? The same thing was done on the Kill Bill movies when we all know that the director's cut will be available sometime in the future.This reminds me all too well of the numerous editions of the Star Wars original trilogy that were released. Do not waste your money on this. Wait for the Extended Editions. I'm sure Peter Jackson and New Line will release them when The Hobbit comes out. Until then, I will just enjoy my regular DVD Extended Editions."
5,Lord of Rings Trilogy is SENSATIONAL,I ordered this for my son's 16th birthday and he absolutely LOVED IT! He's thrilled with the extended version sequences. The only thing he'd add is a sleeve to house all three videos.
1,Release Extended Editions,We have already bought both extended and theatrical releases on dvd. Now they are trying to make us do it on blu-ray. This is ridiculous.
1,This is just sad.,"Loved the books, loved the movies, LOVED the extended editions. What a waste this release is. Hopefully poor sales will send a message to the transparently greedy and arrogantly moronic executive who greenlit this release, or perhaps to his/her boss, so he/she can join the 10%+ of us unemployed who don't have money to waste on duplicate purchases."
1,TYPICAL ISN'T IT?,"These guys never learn. I believe there is something even more diabolical brewing. Get people like us more anxious, introduce the extended version at a MUCH HIGHER PRICE!"
1,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...",LOTR's are my all-time favorite films. Unfortunately I can't keep coming up with more money to buy each release that comes out. Thankfully I was warned of an extended version about the time of the release of the 1st movie on DVD. I did buy the first theatrical copy of the first movie just to get me by before I purchased the whole extended edition in DVD. I have my Blu-ray player and I know they'll have the extended editions later so I'll wait and just keep enjoying my regular DVD copies.I'm looking forward to the Hobbit. Last time I heard it will be shot in three parts. That's a lot of story to cover.Lord of the Rings Rulz!!.... but this theatrical release is just about greed.
1,Will save my money for a good Blu Ray transfer of the EE's!!!,"As with others who are dedicated fans of this trilogy, I am disgusted with this poor quality theatrical release blu ray and the studio's attempt at milking us fans for more money.I will patiently wait for the release of the EE's (please do not DNR them to death!). My old EE DVDs will just have to get me by until that day comes."
1,Blu-Ray version video is weak,"The Blu-Ray version video quality is severely lacking. It isn't as bad as the Criterion ""Last Emperor,"" but it is pretty weak. There is digital artifacting and the image isn't sharp at all. The quality makes the the Blu-Ray look more like a DVD than a Blu-Ray. This is unfortunate considering the movie isn't that old, and while some people have used the excuse that it may be to make the movie look dreamy, it ends up looking cheap and badly made instead.I hope they plan to come out with a copy that is better mastered for Blu-Ray. If I were Peter Jackson, I would be ashamed to have my name on the Blu-Ray version of this film masterpiece.Please fix the awful digital mastering and make a crisp and clean transfer for the extended edition...."
1,Don't let them get away with it!!!,"Please, don't buy this item and show them that fans are not stupid. To release only the theatrical version first is just another rip-off. I don't usually write reviews but this is just one enough."
1,EXTENDED ONLY -- MY MIDDLE EARTH COMRADES,We've been loyal now it's your turn New Line. Include the extended version too!
1,Another studio rip off,"Yet another case of the studios ripping off the public by holding up on the version that everyone would want to own - it costs enough extra already for the blu ray editions of movies without doing something like this. I urge every one to wait on their purchase until the real (i.e., extended) edition is released."
1,Boycott,"Really? Come on and give us what we REALLY want! As a matter of fact both versions of the film should be in one damn Blu-Ray, not 2 different releases. Extended should be the only version on the way or at least both versions at the same time, not make us wait."
1,I'm with you!!!,"Release both versions...some people don't care to watch the extended version, that's fine. But don't make those of us who want the full experience wait 10 more years just to bleed us for more dough...from what I've read, you've made quite enough money off of this franchise already."
1,"Boo, New Line Cinema.","So ridiculous. If the extended edition doesn't have some fantastic NEW features, or the aforementioned option of watching the theatrical or extended release, I may not bother to even buy the extended editions on Bluray, either. My bluray player upconverts rather nicely, and I'm not sure the difference is worth lining the pockets of these greedy b@stards!"
1,I agree,"I own the extended version on dvd. It's a big box set and that is plenty for me. I'm sure not buying it again. I just bought a Blu-Ray player but only for the Netflix capability. Blu-ray is nice, but not worth an extra $10-15 to see the pores on someones face. I am going to keep buying DVDs. Besides I watched LOTR after seeing Avatar recently and LOTR is laughably lame in comparison (effectswise). Avatar has raised the bar now and even Helms Deep (which blew me away years ago when I saw it) now looks like a lame video game. I agree that the LOTR guys are being greedy. Maybe they have the ring."
1,Ripoff,"I love LOTR as much as anyone... and bought the extended DVD edition. I'd buy the extended blu ray edition in a heartbeat. But why not release them both at the same time. As other reviewers said, it's a blatant ripoff and double dip."
1,Same old pattern to steal my$$$,I would hazard a guess that the extended version will come out as sales of this have peaked and then slumped like on DVD to maximize profit - hahaha - just like last time I did not purchase - I waited them out with my hard earned money. The studio needs to learn that jerking around their profits is playing with fire!!!
1,"Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false!","Someone gave me these as a gift ages ago and I foolishly gave away my extended DVD's thinking that SURELY the blu ray edition could be nothing less than the full extended version with all those remarkable extended features (which I love every bit as much as the films themselves). I was shocked to discover when hosting a LOTR marathon last night that these are merely the theatrical versions of the films. What? Why?I just re-purchased the Platinum Edition DVD's...because anything less seems wicked and tricksy, my precious!"
1,This is one thing that isn't Precious,I'm getting tired of getting ripped off. New Line will not be seeing a dime from me on this one. I can't wait till next year so we can get ripped off by Lucas again. These are some greedy monsters that can't get enough. It saddens me =(
1,S.O.S.,"S.O.S. over again. Rip off the public, bilk them out of their last, red cent. Let me suggest to the studio marketing geniuses that they can digest these disks & packaging, accompanied with a cheap bottle white wine."
1,"Will not buy the TE, more corp screwing...","We know what the studios are doing. They are releasing the TE knowing good and well that they have pushed the release date for the EE out far enough to make fans feel like if they want to see the movie on blu that they will have to get the TE and then will want the EE when they come out two years later. Not getting my money like that.All this is going to do is prompt people to rent and burn the TE or download them from the torrent sites. But that seems fair right? You steal from us, seems only right to return the favor.Do the right thing here, either offer both versions on a single set of disks or release both versions at the same time and let the consumer decide which one to purchase."
1,I will not get fooled,"I will not support that ridiculous rip off - they do have the high def extended versions already on their hard drives/avid nitris ! The only thing they'll have to do is to encode it a new - okay they probably want to do some adjustments to polish some material so that it looks good in high def but that's not so big a deal - it's all about fooling us - selling the same thing more or less twice - I'll wait for the extended version, `nuff said !"
2,WOW,Boycott such a greedy move. Extended and theatrical should have been together. What a tragic choice.
1,"IMPOSTER, Do not buy this product!","WANTED: Extended editions on blu-ray only. These movies themselves, 5 stars, but this is not a movie review. I am an avid blu-ray collector as well as a Lord of the Rings fan. This is a studio attempt to cash in twice on one product, AGAIN. If this item sells, the studio will milk it until it's dry and the release of the extended editions will be even further off and more expensive. If we all decide to band together a fellowship and not buy this product, the studio will be forced to release the extended. They need to hear us!"
1,"Resist any urges, and spread the word...","We do not want to go through this again. Do not buy this version just to see it banished to the back of the case when the extended cut is released. Tell everyone. Stand by the dispaly at your local stores and steer shoppers away from this orcish crap. Let's make New Line squirm a bit as this version sits on shelves and gets ugly price cuts.This is the key element:By purchasing this version YOU feed the cycle. YOU empower the studios to sell multiple inferior versions of the same movie.Future prediction:You know as well as I, after the Hobbit is released, this cycle will start all over. We will see new boxed sets with new features."
1,Shameful,I loved LOTR - but there is no way in Hell that I am going to line the pockets of greedy film company execs by shelling out for theatrical releases when I (and everyone else posting here) know full well that those 'directors cut' versions with all the extras WILL come out sooner rather than later.Avoid like the plague and teach the leeches a lesson!
1,"Fool me once, shame on you! Fool me twice, shame on me!","New Line should show some class and release a Blu-Ray collection of all versions as was done with all the cuts of Bladerunner. Especially in this economy I don't think people will throw away money on the theatrical version just to have them a few months before the extended cuts, which by now have become the true versions of the films to fans!"
1,Sorry but I have to wait,It makes no sense to buy the theatrical release when there will be an extended release.
1,Don't Buy It,"I will not buy two different versions of this movie again. You should do the same! Save your money and maybe New Line will get the hint. Come on Amazon, pass your reviews on!"
1,DON'T DO IT!!,"Don't do it; don't buy into this nonsense. They've cheated us out of lot's of money with standard dvd's, and now they're doing it again in hi-def. It's not good enough that we've replaced dvd's with extended, ""special edition"" dvd's. It's not good enough that we've replaced our standard dvd's with blu-ray. Now we're going to have to replace our blu-ray dvd's with extended, ""special edition"" blu-rays. WTF!Don't do it! Not this time! WAIT; HAVE PATIENCE; SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Just don't buy it...,"As just about EVERYONE else has said, the best way to stop companies from the double dip, is don't buy the release that is bare bones....don't buy the release that isn't the directors/extended cut. Companies have been doing this for YEARS...and, you know why?? Because as fans of movies, we'll buy it just for the movie first time, but the SECOND time, they will add, more scenes, a commentary, a great big making of doco. etc. And THEY PLANNED THAT ALL ALONG! Why? becuase that way, they get you to buy a movie TWICE! And of course that doubles profits...and that's what it's all about, PROFITS. So, if they DON""T make a profit off of the bare-bones release....they'll stop doing them. And the only way they won't make a profit...is if we don't buy it. So, let's all draw a line in the sand, and say ""We won't take 2nd class releases of movies anymore, give us the best you have first time...or we won't buy!""."
1,This is why there is Piracy...,But which came first...Piracy or studios trying to squeeze every drop possible out of the consumer...?
1,A contemporary classic in a cheap edition,"For what we know, New Line have been in deep financial trouble lately and this seems to have been the title that saved them from bankrupcy. I guess that is partly the reason why they are trying to manipulate it so much. Releasing the movies in their theatrical versions is one of the cheapest tricks they could have pulled. Let's hope the extended versions come soon. As many have mentioned before: why buying an intermediate product when most of us have it already on DVD?"
1,Ridiculous,We've waited years to get the trilogy in high def blu-ray and now the studio wants to pull a fast one and only release the theatrical version on blu-ray! This is ridiculous. Why can't they release the directors cut extended trilogy as well? I'm waiting to buy until they do.
1,"Sadly, not the extended version, and so I can't recommend buying this.","It looks like New Line/WB are trying to get to fans to purchase this trilogy in Blu-ray twice: once for the shorter theatrical releases, and then again, in a few months or years, for the extended versions that we all wanted in the first place. I refuse.To quote Jason Kottke ""in a way that Gandalf would understand [...] New Line/WB need to learn a lesson from the movies themselves and realize that evil never prevails. Greed has a grip on them stronger than the Ring itself."""
1,Do Not Want.,I won't purchase this product. I'll gladly continue to watch the Extended DVD versions until this is released as a Extended Blu-Ray.
2,Another vote for extended only!!!!!!!,"I buy only blu-ray and have been waiting for years for the LOTR to come in that format... and now I have to keep waiting!? Yes, I WILL be waiting still for the extended version. Ridiculous."
3,Extended editions will come...later,"Movieweb is reporting that the extended editions will be coming later toward 2010 or 2011.""Sources close to director Peter Jackson have informed me that he's holding back the extended editions for an elaborate ""ultimate"" box set release closer to the debut of the new Hobbit films - that's why these are set to be theatrical only. Obviously, not everyone is going to want them as such, but they're designed to satisfy fans who want something in the meantime. So simply be aware that if you want to wait for the more elaborate release, you'll get one eventually. Just FYI.""So you may want to wait...or not"
2,Theatrical Version,"Thank you to the previous reviewers for pointing out the Theatrical Edition release of this blue-ray box set.... In my excitement, I preordered this box set. I just cancelled the order. I can't believe it's just the theatrical version! It absolutely should be both. I protest by not purchasing. I'll wait... It's not like I don't have the DVD extended versions, as do most of us fans."
1,"George Lucas, Meet New Line...","I would never give this series 1 star, not even the theatrical versions. As is being stated by the masses here, the 1 star is for the well bellow par release of the series on Blu-Ray. I don't even mind New Line releasing a Theatrical Version separate from the extended cuts. It's the fact that they are putting this out first, with no mention of when the extended cuts will be released.Why they can't release them at the same time baffles me. Other than the ploy to confuse the average consumer into buying this version, cleverly packaged like the extended cuts on DVD. I, like everyone here, will be waiting for the extended cuts to be released on Blu before letting the studio pull a George Lucas on me."
3,Peter Jackson wants your money!,"That's about all I can say about this ""new"" set. If you don't own any of them yet, I can see getting this set, but other than that???"
1,"Wow, shameless","I didn't understand why there were so many 1 star ratings, but it didn't take long to figure it out..Yup, this is just wrong.. put out the extended AND theatrical in one set.. not two separate releases.. We aren't stupid.."
1,Don't buy this,They should be releasing the extended version not the theatrical version don't buy this or you will just end up buying the movie twice once on this version and once when the extended version comes out.
1,No more,Typical corporate price gouging. It probably costs them $0.73 to produce each set. Give the people what they want and they will come. Treat them like dirt and they will get FED UP. I've reduced my disposable spending 90% and am better off for it. I will not be buying any LOTR editions until I can get them for $5 in the extended versions in mint condition and used which will probably be about 6 months after the extended editions come out. Well-done Warner - now you get nothing from me.
1,"Trying to sell what we don't want, hoping we'll be desperate enough to buy it","The advent of Blu-ray means we can finally watch extended cuts of movies, including LOTR, on a single disc, yet before we can enjoy these amazing films on this great technology, we have to wait through garbage like this.The studios are counting on our desperation for LOTR, banking that we're big enough suckers to buy these short editions and then, in a few months, buy AGAIN the full-length versions.Don't be a sucker. Skip this garbarge and wait for the real thing."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,Wait until the extended edition comes out! Or not and own every edition of every volume ever released! Lame.
1,Rip off - repackaging and leaving out the good stuff,"After all of these years we are only getting theatrical versions on Blu-ray? Is this a joke? No, its an insult."
5,Perfection in a box!,"The Lord of the Rings is so beautiful! Wonderfully directed, great music, spectacular action, great dialogue! J.R.R. Tolkein would be pleased. If you are a fan of the books like me, this is a must have. I love it so much and even though they are long, I still hang on every word. I used to be prejudice towards it but then I was the first 2 movies and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I read the books and now I basically know all their is to know about Lord of the Rings. And no I am not a now life geek, I am a good-looking 18 year old jock who is also pursuing a great education. Take my advice, get it!"
5,Finally,"Barring all the naysayers giving it 1 star, this is a movie that I have been waiting for a loooong time. Such an epic movie should be one of the defining moments of blu-ray. Forget all the negative cry baby's and buy it when it releases. Not everyone wants the extended editions."
3,Was hoping for something different,"While I LOVE these movies and practically know them all from memory, I was really hoping that the final version to be released would merge all the films together into ""The Lord of the Rings"". I realize there would still be several discs invovled, but it would be great to go from the end of each film to the beginning of the next seamlessly. Then all the extras could be put on additional discs - Fellowship of the Ring extras, Two Towers Extras, and Return of the King extras. I'd pay just to have the Lord of the Rings and not the extras, even though I'm sure they are worth it.Because I was holding out hope, I haven't purchased any of the previous releases. Well, I can't wait any longer. If they do release another version in the future, I'll just have to buy that one too.The Dec. 14th release is great. Sort of diminishes the pain of realizing that there isn't another of the films being released that day like the past three years. Maybe I'll get my wish next Dec."
3,WE WANT A FULL SCREEN VERSION!!!,"BIG BOO!!! to Amazon for letting all these ""experts"" rate something that was not released yet, bad form, what are you thimking? How are people supposed to know if it's good? What is the point in a rating system if people who haven't seen it are rating it? Duh, this is a no brainer!!! The first reviews here are POINTLESS!!!I watched mine yesterday and found that, the movie is great, of course, but if you don't have a wide screen, it is annoying.I really wouldn't have posted but I'm SO annoyed at Amazon for allowing this, I won't buy movies here again."
1,Will Wait for Extended Edition,"I won't consider buying anything other than the complete extended edition of The Lord of the Rings on blu-ray. I hope everyone boycotts this theatrical edition release. Do they think we're all so anxious to get our hands on this film in high def that everyone will run out and buy this, then run out again for the extended edition when this company deems it time to make it available on blu-ray? We already have our copies of the extended edition on DVD, so every one of us can afford to wait for the release of the (so much better) extended version.In today's economy it's shameful for any company to be so blatantly trying to milk us for every penny.Boycott this edition!!"
1,**GREED**GREED**GREED**,5 Stars is possible if the Extended edition makes it to the marked.:::GIVE US WHAT WE WANT:::
1,EXTENDED or NOTHING,I agree with most reviews. The choice is very simple: extended or nothing. Cristal clear. Period.
1,Let's stand together and NOT buy this!,"All right people, let's all teach New Line a lesson. I hope to see the price on this drop like a rock as they fail to move. Anyone serious enough about this series to drop the money for the Blu-Ray knows to wait for the Extended version. Let's make New-Line hurt so bad they have to give these out as coasters to get rid of them!"
1,very dissapointed!!,"i ordered the lord of the rings BOX SET WIDESCREEN, i got 3 individual dvds, not the box set, and 2 widescreen and 1 fullscreen. how is that the box set, this is not what i paid for!! they just throw things together and dont give you what you pay for"
1,Er .... what about the extended edition?,"I can't believe they went against the wishes of the fan base and ignored the countless pleas for the extended edition.Yet again, Corporate ""choice control"" tactics in a pitiful and moronic attempt to get more money from consumers. Do they think we are all ignorant, just because we are not powerful and rich like them?"
1,Waiting a little longer ...,They can have my money when they release the extended version. The rating should be 0 stars!
1,stop screwing the customer,"studio greed never ends, people are willing to pay money for the movie again on bluray, all they ask is you give them what they want, a choice between extended or theatrical! dont hold what they want hostage!"
1,Not interested in being double dipped,"This is another attempt at double dipping by hoping fans do not have the patience to wait for the Extended Editions.I, personally, would boycott this entire collection if I didn't love this series so much. The Theatrical Release will not be sitting on my shelf.I'm not worried if I have to wait 2 years for the EE. I've paid enough for these movies over the years and if the studio really wants people's admiration or, at least, their appreciation, they can include both versions on the BR. In this day and age that is most certainly possible and would flout the advantages of Bluray to those unsure whether the format is worth investing in."
1,"Skip this, wait for the extended version",I can't imagine why the original theatrical versions of these films even matter at this point. It's the extended versions that everybody wants and its the extended versions that this particular Blu-ray zealot will wait for.
1,Screw You New Line!!!,"I'll wait till the extended editions come out. As the title says, screw you New Line."
1,Shame,"It's a shame not having the extended versions released at the same time or even in the same product!Blu-rays have HUGE space. Both versions could be in one product, so giving people the right of choice about which version (theatrical or extended) they'd like to watch. I'm sure some real fans would even watch both to compare missing scenes, modified lines and so on. Well, it's seens that by the release date, people will be very busy not buying this, but looking for it on the ""bay"". The P.....Bay, if you know what I mean."
1,*headdesk*,"Oh for crying out loud. I already purchased both the regular DVD edition and the extended editions. All I can say is I'm glad my dad liked the regular editions because it made a convenient excuse to spend all that money (when the extended cuts came out, I gave him the regular ones). As much as I'd like to see this in blu-ray, I refuse to buy this if its not the extended editions. At this point, there is no reason not to release them as well. There wouldn't be such uproar if there was a set with the extended movies as well as the regular ones, then everyone would have their choice of what they really wanted. But to release this, wait to sell a fair amount of them to unsuspecting people, then go ""oh look! it's the extended versions of the movies in a whole new set for you to buy!"" is pathetic. All of us seeing this won't fall for it. I just hope those random people in Best Buy and other stores don't either."
1,I'm not falling for it any more,"5 stars for the movies. 1 star for your lousy buisness tactics. And it's not just this release, it's done for most cult movies all across the board and I'm not falling for it again. I'll wait and wait and wait.Let's make an example out of this movie."
1,F U Hollywood for this BS.,"These F..ing weasels....I'd pay $100 for a set of the extended versions but not a penny for the theatrical vesion....wont even rent it. I've got a 125"" cinemascope screen and can't wait to throw the 2.40:1 image on that baby....but not the theatrical version."
1,Extremely blatant attempt to squeeze more money out of fans,"People were angry enough when they did this with the DVDs, did they really think we wouldn't notice when they did it with the much more expensive Bluray editions? Seriously, who wants to buy the theatrical editions when the extended editions are vastly superior? This is really shameless."
1,ill keep my money thanks,"Yeah I agree, I love LOTR but I refuse to shell out that many clams for something I will be replacing with something (probably even more clams to get) bigger and better. Stop messing around and release the extended editions thanks."
1,Agree... i hope New Line wil listen to its (potential) customers.,"i agree with everyone else. It's a blatant effort to make more off of us ""suckers""... Well, i can't blame a company for trying to make more money... but if they ignore this feedback from their customers, then that says a lot about the company! The movies are worth a 5 star review... even the theatrical version. Why not offer both of the sets, with a discounted price on the theatrical version. Many people would opt for the cheaper option (and possibly upgrade later), and you wouldn't have the backlash that this marketing ploy is creating."
1,Greedy New Line,"I've already bought this movie twice. The theatrical version, one at a time and the extended trilogy DVD. I refuse to coerced into buying the theatrical version on blu-ray, just to satisfy the studio's greed. The extended version was far superior to the theatrical version and should have been the version released in theaters if it weren't for theater owners caring solely on how many screenings they could do per day.As a matter of principle, I will not buy anything but the extended version on blu-ray."
1,Enough with the quadruple-dipping,"Just wanted to add my ""amen"" to the cries of ""foul"" for unnecessarily releasing separate theatrical and extended editions and/or for delaying the release of the extended cuts. I'm beginning to have more sympathy for Jackson's enmity toward New Line."
1,Not Going to Buy TWICE,Anyone who cares enough about this set to but it again when they probably have the DVD version on their shelf already won't buy the theatrical version. C'mon Pete!
1,Won't be fooled again,"I admit, I bought the theatrical DVDs and then re-bought the Extended DVDs, but I'm not going to do it again. I encourage everyone to also boycott this shameless double-dip and just wait for the inevitable Extended Edition Blu-ray release."
1,Would never buy it!!!,"As other reviewers had said, New Line should be ashamed, but hopefully we now know their way of doing business. :DI'm not adding anything that hasn't said, but I had to make bulk on the negative reviews!"
1,Wait for the Extended,"This is a joke. Do not buy this set, wait for the extended edition box set. This is a cheap moneymaking scheme."
1,Do Not Buy This SHORTENED Version of LOTR Trilogy,"This is the theatrical release, and does not contain the extended version of LOTR. Don't let the greed of the movie studios propagate, or you too will be left without ""My preciouss...."""
1,Wait,I think that it's ridiculous that the extended scenes are not being issued. With all of the features available with blu ray they could easily have the option to play the theatrical or extended version. It's an obvious ploy to double dip. No fault to Amazon of course because they're always awesome. I will wait until the full versions come out in a year.
1,BOYCOTT THE MOVIE UNTIL THE BEAN-COUNTERS CAVE,"This is ludicrous and millions of fans know it. Peter Jackson, tell the studio to release to the EXTENDED VERSION and stop taking advantage of your loyal following!"
1,Shameful by New Line!,"This is a serious case of greedy double dipping. Give the consumers what they want! In this day and age of internet piracy, this move by New Line is baffling. They are almost encouraging pirate downloads of the films by offering an INCOMPLETE package on blu-ray.Discontinue this item and give us the real versions with the real extra materials. This is pathetic!"
1,I feel like this has happened before...,"No thanks, we'll wait for the Extended Edition Release this time... Nice try.You have my permission to cry.Should have just released Extended Editions right off the bat, now you're gonna pay for it... dearly. You would think you'd have learned your lesson with the whole DVD release controversy, but I guess not.Look on the bright side, at least you'll be able to build a fort with the millions of copies you WON'T be selling. LOL OWNED."
1,One star for reasons others have said...,"The greatest movie epic of my generation certainly deserves fiver stars. However, as many others have stated this release deserves one star. Like most, I'll wait for the proper versions to be released before purchasing. As a huge home theater buff I have purchased more than my fair share of ""bare-bones editions"" to only see a better edition come out months later. Well, I'm done playing that game."
1,DON'T BUY SEE ABOVE,"I to am a huge fan, and did buy both versions of the dvd for each movie. There is no reason except to take advantage of people, that they are not releasing the extended version. Agree with the above reviews."
1,Capitalism at its best or worst.,"The trilogy is great, this marketing ploy is deplorable. I hope the buying public will wise up and not tolerate it. Very similar to those dvd's that come out as 1.0 and 1.5 splitting up a season to garner more profit. Example the tv series Eureka Season 3."
1,Extended and Theatrical should be in one set of discs - NOT TWO,Adding one more vote for the studio not providing this in both extended and theatrical release in the same package.I'll be waiting until they actually release a proper dual version package.
1,More BS to try to take our money,"Again they show us they don't care about their customers. They want to milk us for every penny. Why can't they just put both versions on the same disks. I won't be buying this, thats for sure."
1,These are the reasons Peter Jackson had such a falling out with the studio.,"Complete Fraud! Do not buy if you're looking for the extended cuts. This studio has made over a billion dollars on this series; and that is after recouping all spent cost. They are nearly one billion in the black with this series and they're trying to push it farther during these harsh economic times. You will not get my money for this nor perhaps for the extended bluray when you finally get around to releasing it.As for the Peter Jackson mention in my title; the studio has been tight-fisted with releasing any of the money they've made on this thing; going so far as to not pay the director (Jackson)contract money owed him when he took initial pay delay cuts in case the movies flopped at the box office. As we all know, they sold through the roof! And the company tried screwing Jackson out of the money he let them hold onto. What d-bags! Good day!"
1,SHENANIGANS! Don't buy! Wait for the Extended Editions!,"Shenanigans!!! I call shenanigans on New Line Cinemas!New Line 1st released the theatrical version on DVD, then the extended version on DVD and instead of just releasing the extended edition on Blu-Ray they decide to first release the theatrical version and then the extended edition on Blu-Ray at a much later date in order to milk as much money from customers as possible. Heck, they could probably fit both the theatrical and extended versions on the same Blu-Ray.Do not buy the theatrical release if you plan on buying the extended version. I wish Amazon and other retailers would take a stand on this practice of milking customers with both theatrical and extended editions and announce they won't sell the theatrical release unless its released at the same time as the extended edition. Yea, the retailers would lose out on some money, but by standing on the side of the customers they would build customer loyalty."
1,How many times can you milk a DRY cash cow?,"Apparently, quite a bit. I feel sorry for the people who don't do their research and will purchase this edition only to see the extended version released on blu ray shortly thereafter. As other posters have noted, they did this on the DVD version and they are going to do it AGAIN on blu ray?! I'm with the original poster, vote this review as being ""helpful"" and provide your own 1 star review for this con game. The movie is 5 stars, the grab for our hard earned money deserves a negative star but we'll have to do with a 1 star."
1,I'm waiting for the extended version...,"I already have the theatrical releases on DVD. Why would I buy the Blu-ray theatrical release? No thanks, I'll wait for the extended edition to come out on Blu-ray."
1,"Forget This Edition,... It's not what you want!","I'm sick of getting ripped off & this is where I make my stand.I want the ""EXTENDED VERSION, OR NOTHING"" ......!!!!!"
1,Great movie in extended,What a waste not releasing it in extended edition. I would have already purchased it.
1,Extended Editions or Nothing,"I would rather watch the extended edition in SD than a beautiful HD version of the theatrical release.To be clear, there is nothing wrong with the theatrical edition from a film making standpoint. If I'm going to invest the time to watch all three movies, I want to see the whole thing. I want the whole experience.As to the motivations of the studio, well of course its extracting as much money as possible from each property. That's their job. They just won't get mine until they release the extended edition."
1,disgrace,I along with many others are giving a great series 1 star to give our opinion on the theatrical version
1,Yes this is annoying,"Yes New Line, who really isn't doing that well these days, is trying to squeeze every last penny out of you by releasing only the theatrical versions. To those of you claiming you're going to wait however, you should know that the extended cuts are reportedly not coming out until 2011 to coincide with the release of the Hobbit. I don't know about you but I really don't think I can wait that long."
1,"Bad move, Newline","This drops my opinion of Newline a notch. This is exactly what they did with regular format. They released the regular editions first, and when everyone bought them, THEN they released the extended edition. Don't be suckered into it, wait for the extended edition, which will likely be a while.I was excited for a split second before I saw they'd done it again. I couldn't believe it. If you're thinking of buying this, don't. Wait. Don't want to take my word for it? Seems hundreds of others think the same thing."
1,We are not as stupid...,"Simple logic applies here: people who buy the Blu-ray of the LOTR is because they are fans of the trilogy, therefore they will prefer, ANY DAY OF THE WEEK, the extended edition. Besides, they are also aware how things work regarding the timing of these releases.We are not stupid. However, we are patient. We will not buy this 'malodorous' edition. We will wait for the extended edition."
1,Not buying until the EXTENDED versions are released. Plain and simple,Give us a break! This is BLU RAY. It can hold ALL the versions. Stop unnecessarily leaving content out thats already on the crappy DVD's! Blu Ray is a top tier format. GIVE US OUR TOP TIER CONTENT! We demand it!
1,I Won't buy this twice,"Even if out of pride they decide they will not release the extended versions, I WON'T BUY THE THEATRICAL VERSIONS.I already bought the two editions of DVD, now the Two editions of Blu Ray?No way, that is an insult.I think the producers are coveting the money the way Golum does the Ring.THE MOVIE GETS 5 STARS, THE PRODUCT ONE.PLEASE DON'T BUY IT.AMAZON DON'T STOCK IT.Side with us, it is a very JUSTIFIED complain, from the Fans."
1,I love LOTR!,I love LOTR. I have spent plenty of money at the movie theaters watching each one multiple times. I have spent plenty of money on both versions on DVD for myself and as gifts! I'm not getting this blu-ray version until the extended release comes out and even then I may wait and get it used just to be ornery! It is a disappointment for sure. We've waited a long time for a HD version.
1,No reason this shouldn't include ALL versions.,"To release a box set that only includes HD theatrical versions is shameless. New Line, ideally, this would have both theatrical and extended releases---but an extended boxed set should at the very least be made available at the same time as this."
1,no comprar este articulo,"Compre este artículo, donde las especificaciones decía que tenía sub títulos en español e ingles y cuando lo recibí era una versión en francés."
1,Pathetic attempt at money grabbing,The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Editions) [Blu-ray]The only copy I'm going to buy. This reviewed set is nothing but an attempt to double dip from the pockets of un-informed consumers. There's no reason that NLM couldn't have set the Extended Editions up on blu-ray and had an option to skip over the additional cuts to see the theatrical release.I never fell for the theatrical release on DVD and I'm not goning fall for it on blu either.
1,I refuse to buy this version.,New Line needs to release the extended version on Blu-ray. They could easily include both the the theatrical and extended versions on one disk via seamless branching. I won't be buying these on Blu-ray until they release a disk with both versions. I am tired of buying the same movie multiple times to get the best version.
1,Greed in operation!,I am not going to be taken twice for this DVD set! I am waiting for the Extended version too! Just say NO to studio greed!
1,Boycott Is the Only Appropriate Response,I'm fine with greed. Piggishness is another matter.New Line and Peter Jackson show continuing disrespect for the audience that made them rich. That disrespect should be returned.
1,Taking advantage of fans,"When my sister asked if this new release included the extended version, I was responding with near certainty that it would until I checked out the pre-order page here on Amazon. There is only one reason for the studio to keep the extended version out of this blu-ray release and it's go force the fans to buy it twice. Unless we simply refuse to purchase this first inferior release."
1,Yeah not extended just makes me angry,i dont think i need to say anything else....why in the world would they not put both versions in?
1,One more voice,"I saw a feedback comment that not everyone wants the extended version - that is just plain silly! Unlike a lot of extended versions (or director's cuts or whatever you want to call them), the LOTR extended versions were very well edited and added depth to the stories. I practically can't stand to watch the theatrical version, it feels like something's missing. Just release a BD version of the extended versions and get it over with!"
1,Just going to wait,"I want to watch this in blu-ray just like everyone else, but am more than willing to wait until the special extended editions are available. Don't pay for the same move on the same format twice. Paying for this is a rip-off!"
1,"it deserves less, but i have to give it at least 1 star","are you kidding me?!i never bought the original, theatrical versions on dvd as i waited on the extended editions. sure am glad i did.when i found out that these were coming out on blu ray i thought, ""no way they'll do two different versions again.""now...WTF?!are they serious?! do they really expect fans to buy them twice?!they can hope we're all that stupid (and some will be, unfortunately), but they won't get that from me.i'm a patient person.....i can wait until the extended editions are released before i purchase these movies on blu ray.and i, like the others on here, am wondering what the crap is taking so long for the extended editions to be released.seriously, get on with it!"
5,BETTER THAN STAR WARS!!!!,"Finally, after waiting 20 years, a trilogy that not only rivals but blows Star Wars out of the water!! For sheer emotion, excitment, romance, courgage, this trilogy will never be beaten.I would advise you wait for the extended edition box set though, each of the extended versions have added so much to these already brilliant films, the extra scenes are paramount to the story. Peter Jackson wanted to release the full version but the studio had it's wait. Buy them to honour Peter Jackson and Christopher Lee, who's Saruman charecter had to be cut from Return of the King.Thanks for reading."
5,BEST MOVIES EVER!,"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is perhaps the best trilogy I have ever seen. The similarities from the books are inspiring. It appeared as though Peter Jackson spoke to Tolkien and brought the characters to live. The cast, the scenery, make this a must have for everyone. You can watch the movies over and over again and never tire of it. It is a story that speaks to the human condition and how it is not always the powers of evil that are at work."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!! WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED VERSION!,"I am shocked they are releasing this without the extended version!I have the DVD's at home that have both theatrical and extended right on the same disk! Why can't they do that here with blu-ray? Damn money hogs! They are just trying to squeeze every cent they can.Well, please don't buy this set. It's not worth it, at all!!You are literally flushing your money down the toilet.Shame, shame, shame on this release.Now I understand why Peter Jackson hates dealing New Line Cinema.I have lost all respect to them. Forget the loyalty to the fans...let's squeeze them for every penny instead.'Nuff said."
1,Why bother with the theatrical release?,The extended version is so much more satisfying and the only one I will purchase on BluRay
1,"Great movies, wrong edition","Don't make the mistake I did with the DVD versions of buying the theatrical release, then buying the extended release.The extended versions of all the movies are much better than their theatrical releases. There's no reason to buy this edition unless your money is burning a hole in your pocket. Just wait for the extended version."
1,Don't be fooled again,"I remember the facts which took place in late 90s when Lord of the Rings became available for DVD, everyone run to buy this product to have these fantastic movies at home (I did it too). But after some months... The Extended version of the movies came out and many people run to the shops again to buy this new pack. And then, the Collector version which were presented on a very fancy box and everything.This Blu-Ray version of this collection is the same. They will launch the very basic version first, then the extended version and then the ultimate collector's edition. DON'T BE FOOLED AGAIN. Let's do common force and avoid buying this first very poor box set and push these guys to release the complete pack for the customers. Let's make them know that we are not idiots."
1,BS,"What a rip-off! What ignorant sheep are we taken for? If the truth is told by the other reviews of this product then let my voice be heard as well! I will not buy a product produced to be a waste of money when it damn well could have been produced and sold for a lot less money!I would have loved to have bought this LOTR trilogy had it been made budget-savvy, but it stinks too much of greed to even touch."
1,They have the technology but lack the will,"Both the theatrical and extended editions have their place. I consider myself a fan of both (I don't always want all those extra scenes) and wasn't all that upset about the two versions of the DVD.With that being said, now that both have been produced and they have the technology to put them both in one release they have no excuse."
1,Wait for the Extended Version!,I agree. Why can't they simply produce both versions on one Blu-Ray Version letting the consumer decide which to view? It's simply a money-making scheme and I'll also wait until the Extended Version is released and watch the DVD's on a DVD player that up converts them to 1080. Thanks but no thanks on this.
1,"Disgusted, will wait for EXT ED","Again, disgusted,violated, but no more !! If you encourage the producers, or whom ever is in charge of this marketing farce, do not be surprised when they continue to do the same thing with future movies! They will most certainly live down to your expectations. Watch how they market the Hobbit! I'm from WI. I know what being ""Milked"" means!"
1,Wait until both versions are packaged together...,"Yeah, fool us once shame on you, fool us twice, shame on us. I fell for this tactic the first round of DVD releases. Not gonna happen again. Don't buy this trilogy until they release both theatrical and extended versions in one package on one set of blu-ray discs each."
1,GOOD LORD OF THE RIP-OFFS - THE STUDIOS ARE AT IT AGAIN,Do yourself a favor and read the first Amazon review for this blu-ray.Vote helpful on it and write your own 1 star review to get the message across.We aren't going to take it anymore! Double dipping is for suckers.Our extended editions of the LOTR trilogy on plain old DVD will do just fine untilthe studios wise up and learn to release BOTH versions at the same time on blu-ray.
1,Shame!,I can't believe they are doing this to Lord of the Rings fans. Do not buy!!! wait for extended version.I hate big companies trying to squeeze every penny from consumers!
1,I will be waiting for the extended addition.,I will not be buying this version I will wait for the extended version to be released.
1,"No, no, and no! Wait for the extended version trilogy, people!","Folks, wait for the extended version trilogy release. This is a waste of your money as there is a whole lot more content (and film!) with the extended versions of all three films. You've waited long enough for the blu ray release of these epic films, but trust me on this one-- just wait a little longer. It will be totally worth your money and your patience, especially if you are into extras like myself.--Christina of ""Chris"""
1,Can you say leech?,"Leeches are trying to suck out the profit for each of these, they filmed it digitally and are still stretching out the releases..."
1,Really? Come on!!!!!!!!,Why the heck would anyone waste their money on this halfass collection?Stop wasting our time and just give us the real thing. Some of us fell for it once so you guys figure you should take us for fools again?DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,New Line is Being Tricksy!,"Well isn't this just plain tricksy! I too will wait for the extended release to come out on Blu. Pretty silly of them to wait, would have been a great Holiday gift."
2,IT WAS NOT WHAT HOPED,I LOVE THIS PICTURE. AND WHEN IT BUY THIS I REWIEWS AFTER THE SPECIFICATIONS AT GREAT LENGUAGES AND TO CONFIRM THE SUBTITLES IN SPANISH THING THAT IS NOT THUE IN THE CASE OF THE LORD OF THE RING THE FELLOPSHIP OF THE RINGS. AND IT WOULD WANT TO KNOW THEY CAN SOLVE IF IT
5,STOP COMPLANING ABOUT RELEASE,"I think yo all need to stop whining and complaning about something that doesnt even have a release date. If they are smart they will include both versions. It says it has 7 discs, there is no reason to have 7 unless you are going to include both. so dont start complaning until there is an official complete listing of what is on them, at this time there isni reasoning to yell. Just look at the release for DONNIE DARKO, it said it would be the theatrical cut only and it ended up being both.so stop crying until you know the truth, g r o w u p !!!"
1,Doesn't even work,"I was to excited to care about the extended version so when I finally received it, it shows a trailer of lotr (what for?!?!) and it goes black. nothing shows up even when you select different scenes! very disappointed. ive never had a blu ray mess up . get it together!!"
1,Send a message. This has to stop.,Corporate greed in this country is completely out of control. The mess we are in with the economy is a direct result. We need to send a message to these companies that this type of business practice is not acceptable. Your money is your voice. Use your voice and do not buy these discs. The release of the theatrical versions is yet another attempt to extract as much money from the public as possible. They fooled us once. Never again. Don't let them get away with this. Take a stand. DO NOT BUY!
1,I refuse to be Lucas'ed,money grabbing poor decision - rip-off - will be waiting for the Extended Edition
3,I'll wait as well......,"In all fairness, I haven't purchased LOTR BD. It being blueray, I'm sure the product is spectacular. My God, it's bd for crying out loud. It's like a rebirth. But having bought the the first extended versions in box set, I'll wait for the same in BD. I agree to an extent of the wallet gouging by the powers that be, but I won't dwell on it. I'll be patient. Think I'll watch again what I have tonight. Ready the popcorn!"
1,Doesn't Work,"First of all, the discs are basically invisible. I have the hardest time finding them. Then when I finally do, I put them in my HD-DVD player and it just sits there. Doesn't even play. It's as if there is no disc in the drive. This is absolutely unacceptable.Sorry. I just had to throw another completely useless review into the mix of 800+ other useless reviews.On a more serious note, I've read that the extended cuts won't be released until the Hobbit movie comes out, so it will be a while."
1,New Line is just GREEDY,"Studios wonder why Blu Rays have not taken off. The pricing is just ridiculous, with retail prices in the $30-$40 range.In this economy, consumers won't buy the initial versions, if they don't have the extended or unrated versions!Serious film fans want to support the studios, but feel TAKEN (Big company Gotcha!), when so many versions of a film are released.I no longer buy the initial version, when originally released as I know, that a later, more updated version is coming at a lower price!PS I own several hundred SD DVDs, with another 200 Blu & HD DVDs."
1,I am no dip!,The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]You will NOT be double dipping me this time (nice try). I will wait for the extended version to come out on Blu-Ray.
1,this is a ridiculous slap in the face for fans,"so New Line decides to release this, charging a pretty penny, and on purpose does not give us the complete movies. WE KNOW THE EXTENDED CUTS EXISTS!!! what they are doing is asking for money now, and again in a couple years when the extended cut hits. disgusting. this is no way to treat fans."
1,Still Waiting,"one star because its not the extended version. These damn people trying to milk ever penny they can from the series. But I will not fall for the same ploy that I did with the regular dvd. First they made the theatrical dvd then the extended multi-disk. then the single extended dvd disk without DTS. I bought all, but not this time. It's the extended blu-ray or NOTHING"
1,Increase The Price If You Have To!,But don't hold back on the Extended Version for Blu Ray. You are doing everyone a disservice!
1,Extended version pls,we want the extended version on BR. Buyers aren't stupid...... I rented on Netflix and the movie looks spectacular but there's no way I'm paying for the theatrical version when the extended format will be released later.
1,Extended please,I'm just adding my voice to the thousands of others who want the extended editions released.
1,No more double-dipping on LotR !,"New Line deserves to lose money on this release for trying to force the fans of their movies to buy several different versions. The BluRay format has so many amazing features, one of which is Seamless Branching (and the storage space to fit it) which allows them to put all the scenes from both cuts (extended and theatrical) of the movie on a single disk, and the movie will play the scenes in the order of the cut you select at the beginning. For New Line to force us to buy two sets of disks, and NOT provide a Branched version of the film is just flat out greed. Do NOT buy this version. If New Line realizes we are sick of double-dipping, they will develop the Extended cut disks with branching for both versions of the films !"
1,Just release the Extended Edition,"Movie is amazing of course, but don't be forced into buying it twice for the extended edition."
1,"Thanks, but no thanks","Like everyone else, I'm holding out until the extended edition is released. Way too much is missing from the theatrical release to make it of any interest for any decent LOTR fan, and there's no way in hell I'm paying for the same film twice.Try again, NewLine."
1,"Great movie, but I'll wait for the extended edition.","In this economy, I can't afford to buy this movie twice. I'll stick with my dvd's for now."
1,Only want extended edition,Its a shame that they are going to do this again and try to get people to buy both editions again.
1,NOT buying theatrical blu-ray edition trilogy,"As everyone has already stated since the pre-order came out for the blu-ray theatrical edition of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I too will pass it in favor of the extended versions. It's very disappointing that the distributer would pull this stunt. They don't understand that there are two distinct fans of this amazing movie trilogy. There are those movie fans that want the theatrical edition, and then there are the Tolkien fans who want the superior extended versions of the films. Both theatrical and extended should have been released at the same time to satisfy both parties. As a fan of the movies and Tolkien I wont waste a cent on the theatrical version."
2,I am in agreement and will boycott,Great work everyone was going to buy theatrical version being inexperienced with blu ray termanology and lack of experience i appreciate the advice and will boycott all movies until they come out with the best version possible.
1,Hopefully New Line end up with a whole lot of LOTR coffee coasters,The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]I think this is the type of GREED...!!!That lead us into to a recession. Hopefully every one out there will leave New Lines theatrical version of LOTR on the shelf. Then they can recall them and distribute to employes as coffee coasters...I will wait for the extended version..!!
3,My feelings on The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Theatrical and Extended Lilited Edition.),"I love the idea that you can choose which version you want to see. The down side is that Peter Jackson should have combined the old stuff with the new, insted of just doing the new stuff. Oh well, it was his choice to make, but overall it was pretty good."
3,Help the Economy,"This is what makes the world turn people.Money needs to be floating around.,$60.00 is nothing a for lots of entertainment.Now because the quality is so-so (haven't seen it yet myself) i could understand, but do it for your country man !Now get sucked back in !"
2,It's a slap in the face!!!!,"How's it possible that I buy this set brand new, and I watch the third movie (the return of the king) and its full of scratches? who should I blame? who? what can I do?"
1,Let this show we won't be duped into buying an inferior version!,"Like the thousands of people are saying in these reviews, DO NOT BUY THIS INFERIOR VERSION OF THE TRILOGY!! Yes, it is arguably the greatest trilogy of movies ever made, but you really need to watch/have the extended versions of these 3 movies to understand and appreciate everything that went into the execution of such a epic masterpiece. If you buy this version on the movies on Blu-Ray, then you will be tempted to buy the extended versions when they come out later. Why waste your money? Just watch the DVD copies of the extended version you probably already have until the Blu-Ray version comes out. Blu-Ray is the perfect medium to put all four DVD disks onto one disk for each movie. Not sure why they did this for any reason other than greed. Don't fall for it."
1,Already own 2 versions on DVD - not falling for this con job,"Blatant money grab going on here with this set. What a total insult to fans of the films, most of which already own 2 sets on DVD. Looks like they are trying the same thing with the Blu-ray. Do they really think that we are that stupid that we want to own 4 sets of the same film? I don't think I'll even bother buying the extended Blu-ray when they bother to release it."
1,BS,I will not buy this as I already screwed up and bought the theatrical version of the dvd a long time ago and got mad when I realized it but it was too late. They can act like they can't put both on the blue ray........but wait Harry Potter did in there ultimate editions maybe the people at Harry Potter are just that much better.
1,We All Want Extended Edition Blu-ray (Not Theatrical ONLY),"As if there aren't enough 1 star reviews stating the exact same thing...Here's my version of this well deserved gripe: NO ONE wants only the theatrical versions of these films. They are epic and are meant to be viewed in the most EPIC way possible, the extended cuts. Either release only the Extended cuts or include both versions. Blu-ray discs can hold 50 gigabytes. Give us a break New Line. Hell, give yourselves a break. You stand to lose money releasing the films on blu-ray in this fashion. Use your freakin' common sense."
1,New Line Cinema shame on you!!!,New Line Cinema will lose a lot of money of releasing the theatrical version only. Movie companies think that they are smart to release there theatrical version first before the directors cut on dvd/blue-ray. Believe me they will continue with this kind of marketing untill the costumers arent to be fooled anymore... just let them know!
1,Extended version is what I'll wait for,Agree this is a rip-off.Publish the extended version AND the theatrical version in one release and I'll buy the whole pack AND pay more gladly.But not like this.
1,Willing to wait a year,"I have read The Hobbit and The Trilogy >15 times. I waited in line for hours and hours for the midnight dvd release for every single one of these movies on dvd as well as the extended versions. I saw all 3 movies one the first available showing and still have the tickets to prove it. Honestly, I wasn't willing to wait an hour to get these releases on DVD. But this ""Theatrical version"" is ridiculous. I am going to wait a whole year for the extended version and not buy this one. I guess they don't want the true fans money. What true fan even watched the theatrical version any more?"
1,Thanks for the one star review,"I honestly would've pre ordered this if I didn't notice the one star rating. I really didn't think they'd double dip this time and would include the extended/theatrical in one package. As a show of gratitude for saving me my money, I figured I'd throw my own one star review in the mix."
1,Will stay with an upconverted extended version,I will keep watching my standard extended version on my Bluray machine and wait for the extended version before adding to the studio's coffers.
1,"BLATANT ""DOUBLE DIPPING""","It is so retarded to just milk the consumer for cash, when Warner Brothers can easily release the entire extended edition trilogy on BluRay instead of the crappy theatrical edition. I know I am not going to buy this (so long as it is the theatrical edition). I hope that none of the consumers buy it as well. Hopefully we can make Warner Brothers reconsider their little scheme. It worked on Spore(EA), we can do the same. Keep rating this product 1 star until they change their minds!"
2,Theatrical only on BD? Please...,"I'm not a believer in reviewing something I don't own, but unfortunately the Amazon review system is the only outlet for expressing an opinion. So here it is: I already have the extended version on DVD. I love this trilogy; the theatrical versions are great, the extended versions even better. I've been eagerly awaiting the release of LOTR on blu-ray... and just assumed that New Line would have the common sense to release the extended version on BD. Apparently I'm wrong. That or (as seems to have been with the DVD versions) they are delaying release of the extended versions until they can milk as much money out of the theatrical release. Let's hope for the lesser of two evils... or that they surprise us come to their senses.When the extended version is released on blu-ray, I'm there. Until then, no thanks."
2,"Great movies, but true fans won't buy this version",Ture fans won't buy this version since they will be waiting for the extended edtion of these Blu-rays. Use your head Newline!!
1,DON'T FALL FOR THIS. NO SALES WILL FORCE THEM TO RELEASE THE EXTENDED VERSIONS!!!,This is absolutely ludicrous! The message needs to get out that they're just selling the theatrical versions and not the extended editions. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Let them regret their decision to market this and teach a lesson to the whole industry.
1,"is double dipping good for business? if you think making your customers angry is, so yes it is!",There is no way i will buy the theatrical versions in blu-ray.Warner should know that millions of fan will wait for the EE.
1,Will wait for Extended Edition - Thank you,If enough of us consumers would boycott this product the studio will be forced to release the extended cut on Blu-ray sooner than later. I will definitely not buy this version.
1,PLEASE WAIT UNTIL THEY REALESE THE EXTENDED VERSIONS,"I love LOTR but the studios are messing with people to make double the money, i will wait until they realese the extended version of this great movie, i love it, i really do, BUT I WILL WAIT, PLEASE DO THE SAME !!!!!!!!"
1,Give me the extended version already....,"Count me as yet another LOTR fan who's not shelling out a dime for the theatrical release Blu Ray, and will wait for the extended version."
1,Terrible attempt at milking fans' money,"Yet another reason the movie industry is so messed up. Do not release Theatrical Editions of films after you have already released the extended versions. If you have just done this in the first place, you would have sold millions of copies of these. So instead, all your fans are holding out for the extended versions, thus leaving you with no sales at all. And if you never release the extended version, fans still will not buy this version. Looks like a lose, lose situation for you in this case.If you have the ability to provide the Theatrical versions, then obviously can produce the extended versions. So no excuses about time and money when you have already made millions worldwide on this trilogy. SHAME ON YOU FOR STOOPING SO LOW!If I could rate this my way, it would get a negative rating for a lame attempt at stealing from customers."
1,Stop screwing the fans please.,"We all have already been screwed once with the release of the theatrical versions followed later by the extended versions on DVD. Now they are trying to do the same thing with the Blu-Rays? There is no reason for doing this whatsoever, other than milking the consumer for everything they have. DO NOT BUY! YOU ARE BEING RIPPED OFF!! AGAIN!!!"
5,Lord of the Rings Trilogy Blu Ray,"This was better than I could have hoped for. I was very impressed. Quality product, as promised in a very short time, straight to my front door! fabulous I highly recommend the process and would do it again!"
1,Two Releases - Again - Total waste of money,I voice my outrage with the rest of the community.I didn't buy avatar for the same reason I won't buy this.I'm not going to spend twice the money for the same movie.I can wait. My DVD editions are just fine for now.
1,Shame on New Line !!!!!!!!!!,Not buying this either. I agree with everyone else here. The extended edition as well as the theatrical verisions should be included in this box set. I give one star only due to the fact that at least New Line is releasing the trilogy and not making us wait years more as each individual film is realeased on Blueray. Hope all these negative reviews will change New Lines mind about this release (whatever that date is?).
1,Why buy it if it's not EXTENDED???!!!,"No Extended version, no money. End of story. Blu-ray is top of the line and Blu-ray owners expect just that. If the soon to be obsolete DVD has the Extended version then the only logical choice for a Blu-ray owner is to purchase an Extended Blu-Ray version. I have money patiently waiting in my pocket for an immidiate purchase as soon as an Extended Blu-Ray version hits the floors. Untill then fellas, enjoy the recession."
2,This does not include the Extended Edition!,"I love the series, but I'm frustrated that they haven't released the Extended Edition on Blu Ray yet. The only reason for releasing the Theatrical version and not including the Extended Edition is that they're looking forward to selling you 4 different sets & taking more of your money. Next will be the Extended Edition Blu Ray set, then the Theatrical + Extended set, and then they'll probably release another collector's edition set with extra deleted scenes & commentary... it never ends. They should just sell what people want & stop playing games."
1,Boooooo!,This is complete and total BS. I'm not buying it until the extended versions are available.
1,Fool me thrice... only a fool would order this.,The extended editions are being released in November for the Xmas rush. This is a mid-year rip-off that should not be entertained. And they wonder why their products are pirated.....
1,SHAM,"I simply cannot believe they aren't releasing the Extended Edition and the Theatrical on BluRay at the same time. That is downright stupid and insulting, and it's just plain greediness from the studio. Too bad its one of the greatest movies of all time --- guess I'll just keep watching my Theatrical or Extended of the DVD cut, since I already bought it twice the first go around!"
3,Blu-Ray Transfer Less Than Optimal,"Before you buy this blu-ray release of the theatrical versions of these films, you'd best read some of the online reviews that are coming out, which are not entirely favorable, especially in terms of the sub-par treatment Fellowship of the Ring has received from Warner Brothers. Even the transfers for the other two films, while better, are not optimal. Think I'll wait to see what Warner does with the extended edition..."
1,"If there were a ZERO STAR option, I'd use that rating","Seriously, why release only the Theatrical Version on Blue Ray when we know the Extended is already out? They are only going to release the Extended Version later, hoping that we'll buy that too? I've already bought this Trilogy Twice. I won't be fooled again..."
2,No Extended LOTR Blows for Blu Ray!,"It sucks. I wont buy the theatrical versions on blu ray, only to buy the extended version blu ray later! Already did that the first time around. I gave away the theatrical versions of the standard dvds to friends. A nice loss of $45.00. Only to pay like 60.00 for the extended dvds! You have to learn from your mistakes. The extended editions are all thats worth viewing. New Line is blatantly not utilizing blu ray for its tremendous storage capacity! Rather they purposely keep out the extended content, for the sole hope of focing you to buy it again! Many will fall for it, I will enjoy my extended dvds unitl the extended blus come out."
1,Are You Kidding!!?,Even the most movie crazed simpleton would realize that this is just an attempt to milk every $ they can by offering a 'theatrical' version here. Don't waste your money. Wait for the extended version and show the money grubbers we can't be fooled.
1,Rip-Off,"Preying on ignorance is not a good business model. If you want this movie in hi-def, do yourself a favor and wait for the extended versionsYou will have to wait longer, but will save money and hopefully help the studios realize they can't get away with this shysty business practice.The studios will say: 'we're releasing it for those who don't want the extended versions...' What they won't say is: 'we won't bother warning people better editions of the movie are on the way, so if you buy it - /shrug'Caveat Emptor"
1,"Forget Theatrical, Give me Extended!!","Dear movie execs. Please don't take your audience for idiots. Especially this audience. I agree with the 1-star reviews. The theatrical is not worth it. I want extended in Blu Ray Goodness. No one's going to buy theatrical anyway, unless they've got money to waste. I think what you'll see are lackluster sales of this product and learn your lesson - listen to what your customers want instead of trying to tell them what they want."
1,I won't buy the theatrical version!! I want the extended!!,"I love LOTR, I have toys, a lot of stuff, including the special extended edition DVD. I care for my money and I won't buy the ordinary version. I want it all. DON'T BUY IT."
1,It's a trap.,"If they didn't want to double dip, they'd release the two versions of each film at the same time instead of trying to release the extended versions closer to the Hobbit while hoping some dupes will be tricked into buying both versions.They had the option to release the two versions at the same time and let people choose one or the other. They also had the option to release special editions with both versions in the same set. They chose to release this version as bait and then try and mop up with the second. Sure, some people are really that un-market saavy, but for the rest of us it's obviously skeevy."
1,Wait for the extended versions,I agree with everyone here who are outraged that New Line is refusing to release the extended versions in favor of these theatrical ones only. I refuse to buy these and will wait until they release the versions I want.
1,that is not fair,"I agree 100% with all the people who review this disrespect of theatrical editions for these greats movies,come on blu ray is better than this so stop to take our money like we are stupids,what we have to do is nobody buy this edition so maybe they can give them for free,I`m one more guy who is going to wait for the right edition."
1,Not going to happen,"I absolutely love the LTOR trilogy.I saw them all at the theater,then bought them when they came out on DVD....and bought them again when they came out with the extended versions.The extended versions are so much better that the theatrical versions.I await the Blu-ray versions,but if New Line thinks I am going to purchase the original versions on Blu-ray,they need to back away from the illegal substances.It's not going to happen.I will wait for the extended versions,or not purchase at all.The movies have made enough to more than cover the production costs...all I see now is gouging.Perhaps it is time I rethink if I should ever waste any money on a New Line flick..theater or home viewing...no matter how good it appears.Now that it is about to be released,I think I'll order 16 copies*G*...NOT!New Line refuses to listen to us and will release the theatrical versions instead of the extended versions.I wish new line well.Edited from my original post"
1,Add me to the list,i already bought the trilogy twice. this time I'll wait until the extended version comes out.
1,Rip off,"Why would anyone waste their money on theatrical releases when the extended versions were so much better. This product should be Extended with the option to play the theatrical. The studios need to stop screwing the uninformed customers into buying multiple copies of the same movies. I understand its business, but its not like they didn't already make ridiculous heaps of money off the movies while they were in theaters. Save your money for the extended version!"
5,Historic Achievement,"How many films can you say will still be watched 10 years from now? In 20 years? 30? I can assure you, this will be one of them. Peter Jackson has exceeded himself to produce a bona fide historic achievement of truly epic proportions. This is cinema at its absolute best. Everyone involved deserves limitless praise. Thanks!"
1,Why so greedy?!,"I saw the LOTR trilogy on sale in Blu-Ray and almost got duped into buying it thinking it was the extended edition. What a rip-off! When are they gonna quit being such stingy hogs, and give fans what they want; Lord of the Rings Trilogy in Blu-Ray extended version. I kinda figured New Line had enough of our hard earned cash already. The extended versions are awesome, but put it out on Blu-Ray for crying out loud!The books are better anyway."
2,Wait for the extended movies on Blu-ray!!!,"After seeing the original movies in theaters, then watching the first two extended editions at the theater and the third movie (extended) at home, there is no way I will watch or buy the theatrical versions again. Not to mention that I too think this is just a money-grabbing ploy."
2,Waste of money,"In my opinion this is a total waste of hard earned cash. I thought I was buying the extended version. It is not. I played the extended edition of the movies in my Blue Ray player and was every bit as impressed with it as the Blue ray, especially for the money. the movies are great, probably the best movies ever produced but the Blue ray package is a waste. at least to me."
2,"theatrical versions only? no thanks,ill just wait!","well,well....as much i love these movies i will not buy untill the extented versions box set arrives,wich could be untill 2012,so be it...i just can't stand the companies ""milking"" us like this,as a excuse Jackson said to have ""no time...to get the extented + extra's box set out in time"",seriously?to make matters worse,the transfers are not spot on,check out reviews on the digital bits etc...a rushed job to get them asap on the streets?annyways,New Line isn't alone to blame for the ""milking"" issue...for now ill stick to my extented dvd editions,i can live with that,cheers."
1,"Yea, i agree with you guys",I won't get this blu-ray version until they come out with the Extended Version. What is the point of having this crippled version if we know there is the full version just around the corner?... wait just a few months to get the better version and let New Line know what their consumers wants by not buying this version.
1,Waiting,"As many of the other LOTR fans out there I will not be buying the Theatrical release. I will wait as long as I have to, to buy the Extended versions.I've seen people ask why not just buy both? Well first off, I don't have 70 dollars to completely waste on something that I really won't use. I could use that for so many other things. Second, it really is the principle behind it! They charge 70 for the first and say 120 for the Extended. Most true fans, if they bought the first, will buy the second! So basically they're charging us 190 for these DVD's. It's nothing but corporate greed. That's all this is. I'm not gonna fall into the trap"
1,Not extended versions,"Save your money!! The extended versions are sure to come out in just a few more months. The studio and/or the powers-that-be are trying to screw the people who really want these films on blu-ray by offering us the basic theatrical cuts of each film. I, and so many others, will ONLY shell out money for the extended versions. I have no reason whatsoever to pay even a dime for the theatrical, non-extended cuts. While still good in and of themselves, they in no way compare to the extended (full) versions of the films. If you buy this, you're getting gypped big time."
1,Hey Newline / Warner Brothers! HOW DO YOU SPELL EPIC FAIL!!!,"If I could I would give this ZERO stars. I WILL NOT BUY THE THEATRICAL VERSIONS!! You can pay me to have them, but I will not pay you to have them! Give us the extended cuts!!!!!"
1,I will wait for the EXTENDED VERSION of the BluRay,"Love the movie - but I will NOT BUY IT AGAIN until the BluRay EXTENDED VERSION IS RELEASED (AT A REASONABLE PRICE)! The one star is for the product - not for the movie, which is 5 stars. I urge all potential customers to WAIT WAIT WAIT! Remember, the manufacturer needs us - we don't need them to screw us again. United WE stand, divided THEY fall! There is no group in the world more powerful than the consumer - IF we stand together - be strong - they will give in sooner than we will!Edward ErlerThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]"
1,Gonna be strong and wait,"I'm glad that people are taking the time to post reviews even though the product isn't out yet. I'm banking on the extended editions coming out in BluRay so I'm going to pass on this, even though it's exciting. (And I loved the theatrical versions, too, until I got to see the extended ones.) I can't change the way New Line wants to handle the release of LOTR, but if enough fans wait on the EE, it at least sends a message."
1,Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do it,"Here's another example of the kind of corporate greed that has gotten our country in the trouble it's in today. Other reviewers have pointed out that there are already three different versions of these films available (theatrical, extended, and limited edition), with two more blu-ray releases on the way. It's too much, especially when blu-ray allows for both versions on one disc, as is already the case in the regular dvd 'limited edition'. Blu-ray will obviously be the ultimate viewing experience for these incredible films but I, for one, will wait for the extended edition blu-ray and I'll probably wait for them to become available on the secondary market as I did for the 'limited edition'. I'm very glad to see that so many others are voicing similar opinions and I hope our message gets through."
1,WAIT FOR EXTENDED EDITION!!,"Dear New Line Cinema,Please release the Extended Edition, I won't buy the Theatrical Edition.Regards,Customer who won't be duped into buying both the TE and EE."
1,"Burn me once, shame on you. Burn me twice, shame on me! NO WAY THIS TIME!","I fell for the bait and switch the first time around and purchased the original trilogy on DVD - only to find out shortly thereafter that they were holding the full, extended versions in the bag so they could sell the trilogy to us twice. I'm NOT falling for the same trick again! Please rate this product (short version of the Blu Ray, not the movie itself) one star if you are going to write your own review. Also, PLEASE rate my review as being helpful. We must band together to send a message loud and clear to the greedy corporate movie executives that believe we're all just a bunch of fools waiting to part with our hard-earned money twice, yet again. Don't let them hold out for another two years to release the extended versions when they could easily release them simultaneously with the theatrical (heavily edited for brevity) versions. Thank you."
1,I hope they lose money on this release,"I completely agree with the consensus on this product; the movie's great, but it's a complete ripoff that they're releasing the movie in HD without including the extended edition. They'll wait a few months and then hope to get everyone to re-buy the movie.I hope that this release totally flops and that the movie companies learn to stop treating consumers like idiots."
1,year's biggest rip off,"this is a fraud, they could include both versions, bluray has the capability for it, but no, they only care about money (their money, not yours), I'm sick and tired of the studios trying to screw the consumer with this kind of politics, not anymore, I'm gonna wait for the extended editions."
1,Take a Stand,"I totally agree with the above reviews, let's all take a stand against this Theatrical Version and Demand the release of Extended Version. We are the Customers, we make Offers and Demands happen in the Business World without us there is no Sell. Be smart and shop wise, wait for the extended version you won't regret it! Take a Stand!"
1,Shameful!,"This is double dipping at it's worst. And to those who give 5stars and claim that the extended edition is not critical in their scheme of things, I just have one question - What reason (other than double dipping!) prevents Newline from releasing both the theatrical and extended versions at the same time?"
1,Nothing that needed to be said hasn't already been said.,"Release the extended edition.Make tons of money.Move on to make other great projects.Stop hanging on to a great film and try to milk it as much as you can. The consumers HATE that.Oh and remember to include the digital copy in the extended edition, thanks. As for this one, I'll buy one of the top 250 worst movies listed on imdb before I touch this."
1,Do whatever these other people are wanting!!!! now!!!,There seems to be some random cult following this product who wants something done! I demand that whatever this is be done now!This is a horrible product!!!This is another sentence soley for more exclamation points!!!!1!!!!1!!!eleven1112!!!!!
1,Do your part and refuse to purchase this!,"Make yourself heard by these large companies. Don't rip us off and don't treat your customers like cattle! I am refusing to purchase this until the extended cut is release, even if I have to wait till 2013 when The Hobbit is out."
1,Please DO NOT BUY this rip-off version! Demand extended editions!,"Like so many others here, please vote with your wallets and refuse to buy this shoddy release! The corporate d*cks are trying to screw you over. Don't let them!"
1,double dipping,Wait for the extended edition blu-ray. This release does not include extended editions. It is a total rip off. The studio is just trying to make a buck. I bet that they wait until The Hobbit is about to be released and then release the extended editions with a discounted movie ticket or something. But lets hope they don't wait that long. Don't give them your money for this p.o.s!
1,Fool me once shame on me...,I was burned by George Lucas more times than I want to remember as an impressionable teenager with these exact shenanigans. I know enough now to throw this back in Peter Jackson/New Line's face.I can't believe their marketing department is this stupid!Waiting for the extended release.
1,"Boooo, I'm going to wat","I think this is a scam! The extended versions should be released as well! I'll be the first to admit that I was sucked into the excitement of the trilogy and unfortunately own both editions on DVD. Being the fan that I am though, I NEVER watch the theatrical edition. I WILL NOT settle for the sake of high def, therefore I WILL NOT being buying this product."
1,Another objection to having to wait for extended,"Basically, the same as everyone else, this is a pointless release. I will buy only when the extended editions come out to blu-ray."
1,how difficult is it to just release the extended versions?,"new line,we are boycotting this copy because we know that for whatever reason, you are withholding the extended cut blu-ray from us.treat your customers right and release the extended versions. don't underestimate the power of your customers."
2,All that $$ and no extended version... I can wait...,Why go through all the waste of time to present this movie on blueray without an extended version as well as a digital copy.I'll wait or stick with my older DVD copy....
1,One Greed to Rule Them All,"I offer nothing original, but agree with those many before who have said (1) Peter Jackson's LOTR is one of the greatest achievements in movie making; (2) the studio's voracious appetites for money and more money attain new heights (or depths, depending upon your perspective) and merit a boycott. It's not that their marketing is that clever. Rather, they rely upon us to be so stupid as to simply buy, buy, buy, and buy. Enough is really enough. The Blu-ray formats of both extended and theatrical versions can, and should, be released together."
1,"Thanks, but no thanks.","First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of the movies. They are fantastic, and I give them all high scores. Cinematically. As for the marketing of the Blu-Rays, I would give this ZERO stars if I could. New Line already double dipped with the DVD releases. No need to do it again with the Blu-Rays. I can understand Avatar doing this, as this is the FIRST RELEASE to home video. LOTR is most definitely not. And New Line will most definitely NOT be getting my money. Well, at least not until the extended versions come out. I won't even rent these Blu-Rays as a matter of principle."
1,Don't purchase this set... Wait for the extended editions,Plain and simple. I'm casting my vote to wait for the extended editions before I purchase. Why waste money on the theatrical set? One star for the marketing team who thought they could squeeze some more money out of the fans.
1,Will wait for Extended,I will wait for the extended editions as well although I might be willing to buy a super deluxe set that had both theatrical and extended editions; especially if it also included the Light of Galadriel limited edition LED flashlight.
1,not again?,"I myself prefer the theatrical versions of the LOTR trilogy. However, the other discs on this planned release are superfluous to say the least, not to mention out of date. These are the same ""bonus"" materials that came with the dvd's more than five years ago. Why are they still being included in the blu-ray release when nobody cared for them in the first place? We could save a lot of money and shelf space with only three discs."
1,Take notice of title - Not Extended Version,"I almost purchased this without closely looking at the title and noticing Theatrical Editions. I should've paid closer attention, but the negative reviews made me look more closely, and I was grateful I didn't order it. I'm not saying that the theatrical version is a bad or inferior movie at all, only that it's bad business to bleed fans dry. I understand the business reasoning, but that doesn't mean I have to like it (or give it five stars)."
1,MONEY GRUBBER'S,WERE IN THE WORST RECESSION EVER! I GUESS MAKING 25+ TIMES THE INVESTORS MONEY ISN'T ENOUGH!!EVERYBODY IS RIGHT!! THIS IS BS-WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY ARE HOPING - WE DROP $$ ON THIS BLU RAY & DROP MORE ON THE EXTENDED VERISION-NO THANKS.I AGREE VERY DIS-TASTEFUL INDEED!
1,doing my part,"I'm also not one to believe that they could not have fit both versions on blu-ray, especially if one takes into account the lack of special features on each blu-ray. The fact that the seperate special feature discs are just standard def DVDs also irritates me.It seems like the consumers have spoken."
1,Shameful,Shame to ruin the integrity of such an excellent movie with this rubbish double-dip. Shame on you.
1,Bargin Bin by Winter Holidays!,"While the movies were amazing, I already have two versions! A third and fourth would be crazy!! I'll get the movie on blu-ray, just not the theatrical version. My prediction, $39.95 by Christmas. Or, if they were smart, (And I doubt they are!) they could release them BOTH for $100.00. I would buy it!"
1,No reason to buy the theatrical versions.,There is no reason to buy the theatrical editions for home viewing. Be smart wait for the extended versions.
1,"New Line, greedy liars",This is bull the blu-ray could hold both versions and new line just wants both sales. well i guess it's bit torrent for me. Thanks newline>
1,corporate trickery,"It's no secret that the DVD boom is over...DVD sales are plummeting and studios are scrambling to replace that lost income. Thus, the Blu-Ray version of the THEATRICAL release of Lord of the Rings. In time for Christmas (no doubt, given the fan uproar), we'll see the extended editions. This is borderline disgusting. Don't let them get away with it. BOYCOTT."
1,"Will buy a copy when they drop price to $9.99. Otherwise, NO THANKS !!!","I will buy a copy when they drop price to $9.99. Otherwise, NO THANKS !!!"
1,Stop the Studio's Greed,"No way will I pay for anything other than the Extended Editions. This is nothing more that a money grab by the studio. Send a message, don't buy this version of the film's release."
1,Extended edition not included,Was going to buy this for a good price but noticed the reviews. This is not the blu-ray extended edition. I won't buy this on blu-ray until the extended edition is made available.
1,Extended Version Held Hostage,"I believe that the studios are trying the same old tricks. First sell the theatrical version and milk it for all it is worth, then release the extended version and create new ferver to vacuum out the rest. I fell for it once and bought the extended version 6 months later. Never again. If they want my money, I will only give it to them once. My money has become very precious to me and I will make sure I spend it more wisely. Many Blu Ray players will take the DVD and up-convert the content to give it a better quality. I can live with that until the extended version is released. Put companies on notice. You want our business, then give us what we want, and not a poor substitute. I made sure to read which version was being released. I will not allow you to trick me again."
1,screwed once again,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT/DVD. This product is being created FOR NO OTHER REASON than to dupe people into buying this movie twice...again. Those of us who were huge fans bought the original DVDs of the theatrical releases. THEN the studio FINALLY released the extended editions, even though they could have released both at the same time. Now that Blu Ray has won the High Def battle, the studios are salivating at screwing us all again the same way!i stole this from another post"
1,Shame on the studio,"I am all for capitalism, but New Line needs to know their audience and understand they are smarter than the average bear !!! NFW are we going to fall for the same gimmick twice. Just wait, this thing will be on torrent sites so fast your head will spin, because of a bad business decision by New Line. Wait for the extended version to come out and then invest in one of the greatest movie series ever produced."
4,Wonderful Presentation of a Classic,"Look, if you're reading this you already, or most likely, like the story and the books. Is it the books, NO, is is a great movie interpretation, DEFINITELY!!! The only criticism I have is that the wide screen presentation destroys the personal impact of the action since even on a wide screen TV its too small but Hollywood doesn't care because its all about their concerns not ours."
3,Waiting for the EXTENDED CUT,"Okay, so I actually understand why they are releasing the theatrical cuts only. PJ wants to include value with the Blu-Ray version of the extended cuts, but in the meantime, LOTR fans are screaming for these films in high definition. So New Line is giving those rabid fans a bone. This is the strip-down version for people who can't wait. If you can wait . . . then don't buy this version. It's as simple as that.This has nothing to do with New Line's greed. We all know they're going to eventually release the extended cut, and we know it's in the works. New Line isn't hiding anything from us. They're simply meeting a demand in the marketplace for an early release in any form.Cheers to New Line for releasing this for those who don't want to wait, and please hurry with the Extended Edition, PJ!"
1,Please Relase it properly...,"Don't buy this version, wait until the extended versions are release it... don't waste good earned money..."
1,RIP-OFF!!!!!!!!,"I agree with the previous reviewers. I was pretty excited to see the release, until I noticed it was the theatrical version. I have the extended releases on all three films on SD. For the studios not to release both versions - theatrical and extended - is just shameful.I'm saving my dollars until the real thing comes out."
1,Greed . . . one of the seven deadly sins.,"If you are smart, you will not buy this junk. The extended editions are what fans want. New line knows only greed and the money that lines their pockets. I was suckered into it once, but not agian. Will wait until they make a giftset with ALL the versions. Come on, were are in a recession for pete's sake."
1,Not being sucked again!,"As others have said... let me know when the ""extended"" editions in Blu-Ray are available.If you don't care about the extended editions then the DVD versions you already own are fine!Those of us who care enough about the movies want the extended versions in Blu-Ray.What were they thinking?"
1,Dont Do It!,"Total rip, not buying it Mr. Frodo. Seems the studio has been influenced by the dark powers of the ring. Wait for the extended editions."
1,"Suck it, New Line!","Not buying the Theatrical versions so you can slap me in the face (like I'm an idiot) with the Extended Blu-ray version later on. Once the Extended version for Blu-ray releases, I'm going to wait until it drops low in price. I may even buy it used at a MovieStop so you get NONE of my money!"
1,Wait for the Extended Version,"LOTR fans deserve to see the extended versions in Blu-Ray, without having to shell out twice, in April for the Theatrical, and then who knows when for the finally-released Extended Versions.Five stars for LOTR; one star for a blu-ray that doesn't include the Extended versions of the films."
1,This is a Travesty!,I am waiting for the Blu Ray Extended release.Shame on the greedy studio execs for trying to bleed extra dollars out of LOTR fans!I will not buy this!!!
1,Not this time,"Bought both versions on DVD and was excited about the Blu Ray release...until I found out it was just the theatrical versions. I MIGHT buy the extended version when it eventually comes out, but would much rather have both in one set. Disappointing."
1,disappointed,Some of the previous reviewers are right. The extended edition of LOTR ought to be included with the theatrical on the same discs. There is no reason why the Blu-Ray can't hold both.
1,"Thanks, but no thanks","I've been waiting for the LOTR Trilogy to show up on Blu Ray since I got my PS3. When I saw a commercial for this, I almost pulled the trigger until I noticed all of the 1 star reviews. I read a few of them until I realized that this collection was not the Extended Editions. Other than sheer greed, I see no reason that this was done.Why not release both sets at the same time? Let the customer decide which edition to buy. Why punish us big LOTR fans and force us to either wait months for the Extended Editions or double dip for 60 - 70 bucks a pop?No thanks. These movies made enough money that this cheap tactic didn't need to be done."
1,I agree,Why would they do this?? Blu-ray has plenty of room for both versions. This is just wrong. I won't be buying (must resist temptation).
1,Enough Already!,"I'm not gonna buy it. Period! There have been SEVEN different releases of this movie, and I, being the LOTR fanatic that I am, have bought all seven. It's not gonna happen with the eighth. I'm tired of being gouged by the greedy New Line people and Peter Jackson, especially since blu-ray is more expensive. Guess I'll just have to wait for the ninth iteration.Hmmm...nine...Do you suppose they planned it that way?"
1,Why.... Why Not give us the extended cuts?,WHY IN THE WORLD ARE THEY NOT OFFERING THE EXTENDED CUT?! FOR CHRIST'S SAKE DOESN'T A BLU-RAY DISC HAVE ENOUGH SPACE?! WHAT WAS ALL THAT 50GB TALK!!! I NEVER UNDERSTOOD DOUBLE DIPPING ON DVD AND I'M SURE AS HELL AIN'T DOUBLE DIPPING ON BLU-RAY!!! FOR THE LOVE OF WHAT'S RIGHT IN THIS WORLD PLEASE DON'T SCREW THE LOYAL LOTR FANBASE!!!
1,Blu-Ray or Bust,"All the 1-star reviewers are spot on, the movies themselves are amazing, but teasing us with this instead of the Blu-Ray releases is shameful."
1,Just piling on,"I just feel obligated to add another 1 star rating because I'm so annoyed. Hopefully New Line sees how unhappy fans of the trilogy are about this. Shamelessly trying to bait people into buying the blu-ray set TWICE. The initial release on DVD is one thing, but to do the same thing to us again?!?! I'll be waiting for the extended versions.The most plausible rumor I've heard is that they are going to wait until the theatrical release of The Hobbit and then start selling the extended versions on blu-ray. All obviously in the name of cashing in as much as possible."
1,"Not just no but HELL NO, were not falling for it this time.","I can wait for the Extended Edition, I wont ever buy the incomplete theatrical edition EVER."
1,Wait until the Extended Edition!,"For most Lord of the Rings fans, the extended edition will be the only way to go! Why not wait and give the studio the middle finger for trying to trick us out of our money by releasing a theatrical version separately! There's no reason that they can't release an extended version with a theatrical version option on the same disks!http://www.amazon.com/Rings-Trilogy-Extended-Editions-Blu-ray/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1239958479&sr;=1-6"
1,"Blu-Ray buyers will not buy ""theatrical"" release","What an utter joke.People who have adopted Blu-Ray are not the kind of people who would buy a ""theatrical"" release when the extended cuts are looming. What a sham. I hope they choke on all the extra copies of this that don't sell.Wait for the extended cuts release or become a sucker."
1,when are you going to learn from your past mistakes dear industry?,"See that's exactly the reason why you will keep on struggling with unsatisfying blu-ray sales dear film industry executives:As long as you obviously don't take customers seriously and apparently underestimate their intelligence as well as their patienceyou will never receive the necessairy support for ""new"" products like blu-ray format. People will stick to their DVD collection andwill further on refuse investing their money in the blu-ray format just because of ""bluff packages"" like the LOTR blu-ray edition."
1,"I've been waiting YEARS, I can wait a couple more...","I even returned an unopened SD trilogy set a few years back awaiting the HD version of LOTR... I now have gained the discipline to keep waiting and waiting...WAIT FOR IT.. WAIT FOR IT...I just hope BR doesn't die on the vine before 2012! Then if the extended version never comes, we might all be scrambling to buy our theatrical editions on BR from the Amazon ""used"" bin...but I'm willing to take that low risk. It's be released. No doubt the master disc has already been made and sitting, waiting for it's time to be marketed.Cheers,Doc RingsSenor de la Anillos"
1,Waiting for extended versions,Stop jerking us customers around & give us the choice of either this or the extended version.
1,Utterly Pointless Edition,"I agree with the 504 other people so far who are basically disgusted that this box set will contain no extended editions. The Lord of the Rings is without any competition whatsoever my all-time favorite movie event, but I will force myself to wait for the extended editions set, and I hope you will, too. It`s about time studios learned that they can`t just strip-mine true fans for cash in every possible underhanded way."
1,do not waste your money,"This is the theatrical cut, you're missing out on tons of quality content buying this version. They're going to 'double dip' the release so that they can try to sell you the Extended Edition (true version) at a later date. all for $$$$$$$$buyer beware!"
1,greedy greedy greedy,like everyone has been saying.....Could of easily realeased BR with BOTH theatrical AND Extended versions on it. I WON'T be buying it!
1,30% off,I see this movie is listed at 30% off. Is that because we only get 70% of this trilogy? I'll wait for the whole thing or be happy with my extended DVDs.
1,Wait for Director's Cut,"I agree with the thousands of reviewers here. Wait for the extended cut. This is what you call movie studio trying to get everyone to buy the movies four times. Yes four times. They release this as theatrical version on dvd then the extended was released shortly. For all of us fans, we bought both and now they are trying to do the same with the blu-ray. Boycott this version."
1,You're all right... this is pretty super lame.,Extended editions in 2011-2012??? That's just lame. The only valid excuse I'd accept is if the blu-ray extended editions are even MORE extended and its taking them that long to film the new scenes!
1,Bawahahahahahahahaha,"Yeah, like I'm gonna waste my money on this set when I know the extended versions will be out not too long after. Sorry New Line, but I ain't falling for it. And shame on you for such a shameless and greedy marketing tactic."
1,Don't waste your money and time.,"I was very excited to buy the LOTR but it's an absurd what New Lineis doing with us giving now only the Theatrical version. Wait forthe extended one. Save your money, don't buy this one!"
1,NEW LINE RIPPING FANS OFF BY NOT RELEASING EE FIRST,THIS is silly. New line is milking you and making us wait a whole year and a half for the real full LOTR Editions. THE EXTENDED EDITIONS!!
1,I hate double dipping....,"Don't buy this, wait for the extended, which is coming out along with the hobbit films. I'm glad to see there's such a backlash, and that it looks like no one is buying this...good movies though."
1,LOTR Theatrical edition step back from Extended version,LOTR is a vastly superior dvd in the extended version. Hope it will get a BLU-ray edition as LOTR is outstandingin the extended version.
4,"Great collection, will keep you entertained for a long time.","Great collection lots of commentaries and extra stuff, will take a long time to go through. The movies were great and long, the extended versions of each movie makes them longer but not necessarily entertaining."
2,Not a complete rip-off,"Well I actually prefer the theatrical release of Return of the King. But I sure like the extended version of Fellowship and Towers a lot better than the theatrical versions. So when this is delivered to my house today I'll get something that has long term value for me.So I can't give it one star, which in Amazon's system is really EPIC FAIL.But I sure would have preferred to buy an all-in-one package that had both the theatrical and extended versions, or a package of the extended editions with just the Return of The King theatrical version sold separately.This stuff about ""you get what you want after 7 other lesser versions have been released"" is really disgusting.So it gets two stars. Almost but not quite completely EPIC FAIL."
5,A must have for Lord of the Rings fans!,Enough said really! The extra footage is well worth the purchase. Great delivery and packaging!
1,Stop exploiting loyal movie fans!!!,"I'm not paying for yet another incomplete set! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!! It's become a trend for the studios to keep releasing multiple versions, formats, deluxe editions, etc. just so that fans will pay again and again. They are cashing in on our loyalty and it's not fair!The writing is on the wall Hollywood! The fans are rioting and you had better be paying attention! We're tired of being exploited!I refuse to purchase until you put both the theatrical and extended versions in one complete Blu-ray set."
1,Lord of the Rip Offs,"Theatrical Versions only for that much money? It is totally feasible to include both versions in this set! And can we please have an extended edition on one disc? When the DVD was release with both theatrical and extended editions, I had assumed the logic would be to have the entirety of each movie dedicated to their own side, not half and half! Stop ripping us off...They wouldn't let me put 1/8 star but i would if I could!"
5,Not another release,"While the LOTR movie and DVD experience is unsurpassed in my opinion, it is being diminished by these constant re-releases.It is bad enough to take years to release extended edition DVDs, and then more years for the HD release, let's see if speculative greed sees a repeat of the Full screen, Platinum, Theatrical and Extended and Limited editions yet again only in HD format.At least this time there doesn't seem to be anything new so I can keep my money safely locked away for the HD version or ""dream on "" a new movie.Rather than doing a little editing and commentary, then creaming more profits, what fans of Tolkein and Peter Jackson want is the Hobbit and most of the short tales in the Silmarillion.Do this and the money will roll in.Until this happens I encourage everyone to STOP purchasing these ""special"" editions."
1,Waiting for extended blu ray,I agree with everyone on the one star review list. I own both theatrical and extended versions on regular DVD. I will wait for extended version on blu ray.
1,We are not fools!!!,"We knew this would happen. The studios are too greedy and they think we are stupid. I am still angry over buying these films twice the first time! I will wait however long it takes. They will not get my money for this insult of a Blu-ray. Judging from the 2,000+ negative reviews I am not alone!"
1,Fool me once...,"Sorry, New Line. I already played the buy the Theatrical's then buy the Extended's game with the original DVD release. Not doing it a second time with the Blu Ray. I can wait for the Extended Versions. And if they never come out them, then no Blu Ray for me at all."
1,Extended or Nothing!!!,"Thanks, but no thanks. I'll wait for the extended edition if it ever comes. If not, forget it. I'll stick with the old dvd extended edition. You'll never get my money for the theatrical version.David"
1,Unprofessional seller,"Totally disappointed! Doesn't have subs/audio in Spanish. French only. I dont want this version in French, because I'm not French or at least don't understand French."
1,Don't waste your money,The movies are great but the picture quality is not very good for Blu Ray. For a newer movie I was surprised. I know a lot of people are not happy that this is not the extended version but I can live without the extra footage. I'm just disappointed in the picture quality. For a hi def movie I was expecting more.
1,It is not ok,"for people to download movies illegally, but it is ok for Warner Bros and other studios to rip us off. It is ok for them not to pay the artist (Tolkien Foundation) the royalties as they had promised cause lawyers are cheaper. It is ok to have the extended editions (and perhaps the 3D versions) in different releases. Well as George W said full me once shame, shame on you!"
1,Why bother releasing this? Nobody should buy it!,Don't buy this. Wait for the extended editions to be released. It's a cash grab.
1,Editions,The only release of this films should be a box set containing BOTH the Theatrical & Extended Editions.I got ripped off the first time around with the DVD release - I won't be fooled again.
1,We want extended editions on blu-ray!!!,one of my fav movies of all time. movie itself is 5 stars. extended editions are sooooo much better than theatrical editions.
1,no extended then no BUY,I have LOTR twice in DVD and IT WONT HAPPEN AGAIN ON BLURAY. DONT BUY THIS MOVIE UNTIL AN EXTENDED COMES OUT
1,Extended Edition Please!!!,Im not spending money on a bray for a movie if it costs so much and you don't get the Extended Edition if I bought it on DVD.
5,lotr extended version review,"After seeing the theater version sometime ago and being dissatisfied with too much action and too little story and character development, I was very pleasantly surprised to find the extended version be much truer to the book. Here you get the original prelude to the story of the ring as well as many of the secondary story lines developed in detail. If you are a true Tolkien fan, this edition is well worth it."
5,Wonderful box set!,"This box set is amazing. I expect nothing less for the price, but I certaintly think your getting what you pay for with this box set. It's got so many extra features I will probably never watch them all. The extended editions are great and are seamless. I even watched some of the commentaries after I watched all three extended editions of the movies. I recommend this to any friends who like Lord of the Rings!"
1,It's because of the Hobbit......,"The Hobbit is going to be released theatrically in late 2011 (at least part 1 is...it will be in two parts). They are holding back on the extended versions until then (I have this from an insider source). This really is a sucky double-dip and while LOTR is my all time favorite movie trilogy, I will NOT buy this version. After watching the extended versions multiple times, these films would seem completely chopped up. I strongly urge anyone who wants the extended versions not to get sucked into this double dip, which only rewards the bad behavior we all hate. There are tons of good films on Blu-ray now. We can wait."
1,Quit Yanking Our Chains,"I have to agree with the other reviews posted here. It's insulting that New Line is once again yanking our chains by offering the standard movie releases and stringing along those of us who want the extended versions. I already have bought the extended versions in standard definition so it's not like they didn't already get money from me. Is it their intent to dupe people and, effectively, make them wary about buying future products from the company?This is a very unwise move. As can be seen from the backlash here, it will also earn them a lot of ill-will from the fans."
1,DO NOT BUY THE THEATRICAL VERSION,"I will not be purchasing this set, as much as I'm dying to have the movies on BluRay. The fact that they aren't going for a single ultimate extended box set insults me as a fan of the movies.I already bought the theatrical AND extended DVDs. I'm not buying the theatrical movies again on bluray and as far as I am concerned, they no longer exist.Stop screwing with us, new line."
1,Boo...Hiss...Double Dip...Boo...,Lame. Why not give us both extended and theatrical in one set? I'd pay $100 for that. But there is no way I'm paying $70 now and however much they choose to charge us three months from now when the extended editions drop.Very disappointed with this announcement.
4,It was excellent!,"I was on a tight budget and really wanted to purchase a set with alot of extra material. I recieved alot for such a little amount and the person to whom I gave it loved them, and wacthes them constantly."
1,Double Dip,This version is only the theatrical version of the movies. They're simply trying to double their income by holding out on releasing the extended edition... just like last time when they came out on DVD...
1,I want the extend editions and the theatrical releases in one collection,"I want the extend editions and the theatrical releases in one collection on blu-ray! Why do we have wait 1-2 more years?! Booooooooooooooooooo.I will not buy this, no I won't; you can not try to shove it down my throat."
1,Why Does the Studio not give me what I want?!,"I own over 300 DVDs and my Blu Ray Collection is growing at almost 50 now. I'm all too familiar with quickly buying my favorite new movie on DVD, only to have a ""Special"" edition come out 3 months later with extended scenes and much more goodies.LOTR is one of my most sought after Blu-Ray movies, but I'm not going to shell out for this cheap copy. I want the Extended version! Why not just put out both the Theatrical and Extended versions at the same time? That way true fans can get their coveted copy and casual fans can get their theatrical version.I don't understand why you must hold that copy hostage!"
1,RIP OFF,"like the others, i am dissapointed that they did not release the extended versions of the movies on Blue Ray. DONT buy this set until they release the sure to come extended versions."
1,Fire the bean counter,"Further to someone elses comment about the bean counter trying to make extra $'s for the Studio by delaying the extended edition's release; they should now be thinking seriously about firing some people. All the lost Christmas spend and associated profit, rapidly headed elsewhere!Great movie, unacceptable delay in release of the Extended version."
1,"LOTR Trilogy ""THEATRICAL EDITIONS""!","Simply put, these are my 3 favorite movies. I feel like I've already been cheated, buying the theatrical release box set, only to have the(much better) extended release versions come out a short time later. Of course, I bought them too. I'm not going to fall for the same money making gimmick again when upgrading to Blu-Ray disk! I'll wait for the release of the extended versions, and with luck, the theatrical versions will be included as they should be. For now, my Blu-Ray player upconverts my extended version DVD's just fine."
1,movies are great - DVD is a rip-off,"The movies are greatness and the distribution company that puts out the Blu-ray is certainly entitled to try and make as much money as possible by selling it to you twice. You, as a consumer are also perfectly entitled to let them know via your business, or lack there of, that you don't like getting ripped off. This Blu-ray edition is a rip-off."
1,Don't waste your money,"Notice I am reviewing the LOTR BLU RAY Trilogy set. this is the theatrical cut. WAIT for the set which includes the longer versions. It's much better. Also, they are releasing these separate, to try and get you to buy them AGAIN. DO NOT BUY THIS SET!WAIT until the REAL set is made."
1,No Way,Releasing the theatrical version in blu-ray is unacceptable. I hope these reviews keep this product on the shelf.
1,Lame.,"You know the drill. The big movie companies, in an effort to make as much money as possible, will re-release their movie on as many different formats, in as many different editions as possible. Of course, they delay the good stuff hoping some pay twice, or maybe they don't realize the good stuff it still to come. Either way, the consumer gets screwed. Well, here is a good ol ""screw you"" right back."
1,Oh boy here we go again....,"Just like everyone here, I LOVE LOTR! But this douple dip scheme is not fooling me again. Why they need to screw the fans is beyond me. Ok you want the Theatrical editions fine but don't release them first wanting to score a quick buck and then the Extended editions. I HATE THIS please give us the EE!!"
1,Lord of the RIP-OFF!,All the complaints are TRUE!! DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY DVD!! Wait until the Lord of the Rings EXTENDED VERSION Blu-Ray for your hard earned dollars!! Don't give the sellers the satisfaction of knowing they're fooling the general public!
1,"DO NOT BUY, wait for EXT Edition","I'm a big fan of LOTR but this release is a scam. I have both sets on DVD and I see no reason to buy the Theatrical edition on Blu-Ray. The Extended Editions will be out shortly after this release and will have the option to play Extended or Theatrical editions. It's just a big cash grab, don't get suckered."
1,"Do Not Buy, New Lines, Lord of The Rings, Theatrical version.","New Line, SHAME ON YOU.I will NOT buy a single product from you again until you stop robbing and steeling from people.All you care about is making a buck. Can you say, Boycott!Wait for the REAL version to come out!"
1,Not extended edition? Meh.,"I never bothered to buy the theatrical editions of the DVD's because I felt they were lacking, even Fellowship of the Ring. I waited a year to buy the Extended Cut for each film. No way if I did that would I ever even considdery buying blu-rays of the theatrical editions. Too bad I'll probably have to wait a year again. Only get this if you didn't like the Extended Editions."
1,Waiting for extended versions,"I was looking to buy these versions on blu ray but after reading the reviews and understanding what the distributors are trying to do, I wont be buying this until it is in the final extended version. Recommend that you do the same."
1,Will not buy!!!,I will echo the sentiment of others and say that this is a blatant attempt by New Line to get you to double dip when the extended cuts are released on Blu Ray.Send a message to the studio and boycott this release!
5,Some of us PREFER the Theatrical Release,The theatrical release has a better tempo and pace. I also don't like having to change discs mid-movie. I am PERFECTLY HAPPY purchasing only the theatrical release.
5,Stuborn and greedy executive @$$holes! Just give the EXTENDED version the first time.,We demand the EXTENDED edition the first time and we will vote with our dollars. Your greed will only hinder future sales if an extended edition is sold later.
1,Don't waste your money,"Folks this isn't the extended version ,so it is a waste of your money. Don't buy it."
1,MONEY GRAB,This is disheartening. Hopefully they won't drag out the second release because there is no way I'd buy this.
1,Another poor release.....,"I have to agree with everyone else; Why can't they just give us both versions all at once. People are tired of the games these companies play. Release the titles with all the versions/extras and just charge more for the whole package. Blu-ray may have one the hd battle, which by all means is fine with me; I don't see why companies want to ruin a good thing by thinking consumers will fall for this same line of garbage. It's not just the LOTR movie pack doing this, its several blu-ray packs trying to jip us. These companies can suck a fart out of the part of me where the sun don't shine =)"
1,Not the extended version!!!,This is not fair.They did the same with the DVD version and many of us bought the Theatical version first only to realize that a new extende version is on the way.VOTE FOR THE EXTENDED VERSION AND SIGH UP TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN THE EXTENDED VERSION BECOMES AVAILABLE.
1,Ridiculous Rip-off,This is ridiculous..~!!! I will NOT buy this version .. this blatant rip off almost makes me think twice if I will buy the extended version when it does come out. I am very disappointed.. Shame on you Newline!!
5,"Agreed with others here, will not purchase - waiting for Extended Version","I love these movies, they are some of my all time favorites. But most of us who love them already have them, and won't likely be forking out more money for a version that does not include the extended release. To most, they are the complete versions of the films. I encourage those of you considering this purchase to hold back your money and wait - buying this will only reinforce the idea that they can release multiple versions over time to increase their profits."
1,+1 Disgusted at this attempt to exploit the fans,Add me to the list of fans who bought both sets of dvd editions and is now expected to do the same for blu-ray.There is no way in hell I am touching this even if the price drops. Not willing to reward this attempt at exploiting a market.Since getting the extended edition dvd's have watched them many times over. I have no desire to watch theatrical release at all.
1,Oh Really!?,"Not the extended edition!? I was soooooooooo ready to pull the trigger on this. Thanks for the other reviewers pointing out that this is JUST the original theatrical release and not the extended version as well. Nice try NEWLINE, nice try."
1,Not worth the money,"This release is in no way worth the money. They short changed the movie, and is not worth buying. Save your money for the extended release."
1,Read before you buy!,"First of all... Yes, I was one of the impatient people that bought this non-extended edition version. The audio and video quality are so superb, this is ALMOST what I was waiting for. I foolishly thought that I could stand watching the Theatrical Cut, even though I watched them only once in Theaters and waited for the Extended Edition on DVD. I've watched it so many times on the EE, that going back to the Theatrical Cut seems like a bad TV edit... Very rushed. You'd be suprised how many small momements or lines that are cool are removed or worse: CHOPPED DOWN!!Also, the price of this movie set is jacked up by the inclusion of 3 DVDs for that Digital Copy GARBAGE. Will somebody please give us the option of not wasting money on Digital Copy disks that we never use??I know that local retailers that buy back movies will be flooded with these sets if you do want one. I know I'm dumping this one as soon as the EE has a hard sale date to pre-order."
1,Epic Fail,Money hungry studio producers think we are dumb enough to buy both sets again? We all have the extended versions and can wait until the extended versions come out on blu-ray. cancel this release and just release the extended versions.
1,Thanks for nothing New Line Cinema!,"Well, here we go again. Another movie studio company trying to profit as much as they possibly can from a franchise that made serious dollars at the box office and home video sales. Why would I want to purchase the theatrical versions on blu-ray when the extended versions are guaranteed to be released? I guess I (along with the thousands of other LOTR fans who posted comments)have to wait until that happens."
1,Hold Out for special edition,"I disagree with previous post, after fellowship they did release extended versions at the same time. Still there is only one true LOTR trilogy and it is the extended editions."
1,Release Date?,"Don't support studio double dipping techniques!!! Either way, WHEN IS THE RLEASE DATE FOR THIS?"
3,Cha-Ching! Cha-Ching!,"You talk about milking it!I'll spend my money more wisely now. I'll wait for the extended cut this time. I bought both the theatrical and then the extended cut last time and I was disappointed how they ripped me off the first time around. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."
1,Who is interested in just the Theatrical Edition?,"Not me! Another vote for the extended edition and this one gets 1 star, not because of the quality of movie (5 star), but just to bring down the user ratings of this marketing attempt by New Line to fleece the fans and line their pockets. Shame on you!"
1,tease,"Like almost everyone else here, I want the extended versions on Blu.New Line: ""Here, buy this version first. You know you want it. Oh, whatever man, it's only money. You can buy the extended versions later. Common, give us your money. Twice. It's no big deal.""Me: ""No. You greedy tease. If you had an appreciation for the fans, you know, the ones who gave you all that money in the first place, you would release the extended versions at the same time as the theatrical ones. So I will wait, thank you very much."""
4,Awesome but with some comments,"I really enjoyed all of the movies, good presentation, and very good additional material.I only have to complaint about the subtitles, the technical information said that all of them have spanish subtitles...In my case only 2 of them had it."
1,Im unhappy,"Im in the United States and thus unintelligent when it comes to the differences in technology from other countries, I had no idea what ""Region"" meant, so happily I ordered this set, picturing my dad's face as he unwrapped the coolest present ever. Much to my dismay we found out that Region 2 DVD's cannot be played on our Blue Ray. We didnt open it til christmas so I had no idea I was giving him a gift he couldnt watch. GRRRRR. What do I do now? I wish that there was some way that Region was a little better clarified in the description of the product, Please put in big bold letters where this movie can be watched instead of putting it in small print."
1,Boycott this limited edition and let Peter Jackson know we won't stand for exploitation.,"Just adding my vote to send a message to Peter Jackson we recognize this for what it is: exploitation. Boycott it. The sooner it bombs, the sooner we will get the real deal."
1,Wait for the Extended Edition,Rereleasing the theatrical version is simply the studios ripping off the public to make even more money off a film that broke records. Wait for the ext. edition.
1,What a joke,"This is unbelievable that they are releasing the Theatrical Versions and not the Extended Versions. I will not fall for it and I suggest you shouldn't either.The sad part is, they'll still make a killing off of this release."
1,boo! hiss!,"May as well join in the chorus. It is long past time that we folks who have made the blu-ray format a success be rewarded for the effort. There is no excuse for any blu-ray issue to be anything other than widescreen and fullscreen, theatrical version and extended version, and with all the bells and whistles available. JUST DON""T BUY THIS VERSION. Perhaps when the studios see it sitting in the 2-for-$10 bins at Wal-Mart a year from now they'll get the message."
1,"Crummy, crummy business decision","This is obviously some kind of business decision by New Line in order to get the desperate to double-dip. In return, I have to wait another 2 years to get the high-quality version of a movie that I have already paid for. That's garbage. I can't help but think that the bad-will this decision is creating will eclipse any financial gain the studio will make.I am not buying Lord of the Rings again. I already bought the extended editions on DVD. I will buy the extended editions again on Blu-Ray in a couple of years. I will also do my best not to buy additional New Line products or see New Line movies during that period of time. I would encourage anyone reading this to do the same."
1,Attention Marketing Geniuses,"Yes Marketing Gurus, with the last set of dvds for this trilogy - releasing the originals then the extended worked well for pete's wallet - however this time there is only a certain amount of people out their with blu players - most of which are film enthusiasts - most of which will not buy this version and will wait the second - Just release the extended we dont want these and we dont like your tricks. New line has enough cash and so does pete - now give us what we want."
1,"DON'T BUY THEATRICAL EDITION ON BLU RAY, WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED EDITION","There is no reason why New Line/Peter jackson not release the EE at the same time as the theatrical except for GREED. Truth is, 90% would buy the EE and never buy the theatrical. By releasing the theatrical first and holding out the ""precious"" EE, many will buy the theatrical BR only to buy the EE BR years later-DOUBLE DIP!!BOYCOTT THEATRICAL LOTR ON BLU RAY FOR EXTENDED EDITION ON BLU RAY!!!!"
1,Join the One Star Revolution,"I know that the ""Biz"" is a for-profit venture. However, there is a limit. The voice of the customer is what any business should be about, and folks, this is not it. We all know how great the extended versions of these classics are, and they insult our intelligence as consumers by pushing this tripe on us.Are they right? Don't you let them believe it for one second. Show them that the customer is STILL always right!"
3,"Not buying, waiting for Extended Release","Ok gang, come on. You REALLY wonder why New Line does this??? You people (for all your rampant complaining) STILL BUY IT!!! If you want to change the studio's business habits, then do NOT buy this release! No one can force you to buy it, so quit acting like New Line is at fault for you making a purchase.Awesome movie. Anxiously await the Extended version releases."
1,Dissapointing sale politics,"I've been waiting for the news on LOTR BD release for a loooong time. And now that I get the message about this release I can only say it's terrible that the studios have decided to fool the fans the same way they did with DVD - tricking into buying this stuff twice for no reason. I say ""nay"" and I hope they get a new idea out of it."
1,Waste of money,Wait for the extended.....why do studios feel it is okay to do this to consumers? The double dip must work well becuase they just keep doing it.
1,"Fool me once, shame on you. Twice? Shame on ME!!!",Let's show the world capitalism as work! Speak with your wallets and do not purchase this version! Make the release a disaster and they will want to move up the release of the extended versions sooner!
1,Wait For Extended Edition,*sigh*This is pretty disgusting stuff New Line is doing with this franchise. It says the Extended Edition is expected to release in 2011-2012... seriously? Very pathetic. Then to top it off they are re-releasing this. What a sad joke... >_>
1,Where are the extended cuts?,"There is no reason given the size of a bluray disc for these movies not to be the extended cuts. I don't care about the extra bonus features, I just want the extended cut of the movies in 1080p. I will be waiting for the real versions."
1,LOTR Blu-Ray Theatrical Release is a Rip-Off,"I bought both editions of LOTR - theatrical and extended - before....I'm not going to do it again...you should have just released the extended versions alone or both theatrical and extended versions together on Blu-Ray... You won't get my money until you start respecting your customers...and you, the motion picture industry, always crying about the public buying bootlegged DVDs ripping you and the artists off.......and I never have bought a bootlegged copy of anything...but you don't seem to have any problem with ripping us off as many times as possible...you have gotten your profit & the artists have gotten their royalties from me twice over now........but not again........I'll use Netflix until you come out with a product that has both versions in Blu-Ray....Shame on you!!!!!"
1,Save your money,Please do not give in. Do NOT buy this edition. Wait for the extended versions. It's time to fight against double-dipping.
1,"The movie is great, the product is not!!!","Delaying the Extended Edition, so they can make money on both versions is Complete BS! Do not buy the standard edition. If you must have it, there are other ways of acquiring it ;) Until then, we should all be on strike!We want the extended edition, we want the extended edition, we want the extended edition, LOL!"
1,No sale.,"I know they are telling us up front these are the theatrical editions only, so I don't feel we are being ripped off. No one is making us buy them. However, with blu ray technology there is no reason we couldn't have both versions on these discs, so for that reason I will wait."
1,Oh no you don't,"To all studio execs at NewLine: It is pretty clear from the overwhelming amount of posts here that we are not going to fall for this double-dipping attempt, especially when economic times are tough. When it came to buying the boxed editions on DVD, I chose the extended version. And now when it comes to buying the blu-ray, I will buy the extended version. Save yourself alot of wasted blu-ray discs and put out the EXTENDED VERSION ON BLU-RAY!! We have fallen for this before with George Lucas and the twenty different versions of the original Star Wars trilogy, and the experience has made us wiser.Thank you.LOTR fans"
1,I absolutely agree,"I guess people is tired of bs. Blue ray is got capability, it can hold both versions, theatrical and extended. Do it. Both versions together NOW. Other wise keep this versions for yourselves I'll wait with the rest til you published the darn thing right."
1,EXTENDED EDITION...,No price gouging: offer the option of the extended edition Blu-Ray at the same time!
1,Waiting for Extended Blu-Ray Version ..,"They can keep dropping the price down, but it doesn't matter to us since we already have the same in DVD format. We just won't buy it in blu-ray until the extended version is released. And even then, we won't buy if the price is too high.This product gets the lowest rating I can give, since not releasing the extended version in Blu-Ray so that they can double-dip is an insult to the movie's fans."
1,Thanks for helping me save money.,"I always check the reviews before purchasing any product. I am very happy that so many negatively reviewed the method of release of this video, not the movies themselves, before I purchased them. Maybe I would have noticed that it wasn't, but I assumed when I saw LOTR in Blu-ray advertised that it would be both theatrical and extended versions. I too will wait until the extended version is released in Blu-ray."
1,COMPLETE BULL,"This is purely a money grab by the studios. Give fans of the films the OPTION to watch either the Extended Edition or the Theatrical cut. Don't make us pay TWICE, and also, please don't make us wait yet ANOTHER year for the Extended Editions to be released!"
1,Awesome trilogy!!! Ripoff packaging !!! DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!,"This version of the movies do not have the extended versions of the movies. You will buy this version and then 2 months later the studio will release the extended, ultra super, directors cut version!! Don't be fooled or you will be selling your ""old"" BluRay Theatrical Edition for pennies on EBAY or Amazon marketplace....You've been warned...."
1,"WTF, where are the extended editions","Movie is the best I've ever seen. I will not buy this though. I will watch my extendted edition (the actual complete movie) dvds until they get their heads out of their buts, and give me the extended editons. Click this was helpful if you agree with me."
1,Do not allow them to double dip our hard earned cash,"Of course, this is not a review of Peter Jackson's amazing work of art, which deserves a 5 out of 5, but merely a 1 out of 5 for a product that wants our cash but robs us of the extended scenes.Tell them we won't buy it, and will wait for the extended editions on blu-ray."
1,What a joke,"I was about to buy this item but luckily I read the reviews and noticed that this isn't the extended edition. It is just another ploy to get more money out of you when in a year from now they come out with the extended edition on blue ray. Forget that, they just lost my money. I will stick with the old version and wont likely buy the new one even when it comes out. I cant reward this greedy behavior from the studio."
1,The Lord of the Rings:the motion picture trilogy,While I have not seem LOTR on blue ray i agree with my fellow fans of this release its a money ploy. I to have brought both verisons orginal and exended on reg dvd i thought both would be on this release in blue ray i'm very disappointed in this release an will not buy it the fans are no fools.
1,I'm with the pack,"I'm with the pack on this one. I can't believe that they won't release both in one awesome package. I absolutely will NOT buy this even though I'm drooling for LOTR in HD. I will, however, Netflix them to pacify myself until they eventually do release the extended cuts."
1,Give the people what they want.,I'm in the same boat. I will not purchase this product. LOTR have several loyal fans who own the extended version of all 3 films. Why would I pay $60 plus dollars for the original release AKA Star Trek. Stop taking advantage of us. The people have spoken.
1,Don't bother with this version,The trilogy is amazing but there is no point in purchasing this theatrical version on Blu-ray if you have the extended versions on DVD. The extended (Director's Cut) version of the 3 films are what Peter Jackson originally intended. Save your money for the HD version of the extended cut.
1,Don't play games,"Boycott this. There is no reason (other than for the studio to make more money) to hold up release of the extended version. New Line, you have a loyal following for these films. Stop playing games."
1,For Deans By Deans (FDBD),"This is for deans. LOTR is the greatest thing that ever happened to the world.Releasing the movies like this again is really not cool and is totally for deans.I like many of you, bought every DVD when they released it. Then they released the extended edition, and I bought all of those. We all know that for the huge LOTR fans, we just want the extended editions in Blu-Ray.Obviously, they are waiting until 2011 or 2012 to do that so everyone buys the movie twice on Blu-Ray... so when it is all over there will be plenty of people who have 4 different copies of this film.For Deans By Deans."
1,Fool Me Once Shame on You...Fool Me Twice Shame on Me,"Like the classic song from the Who proclaimed ""We won't get fooled again!""Wait for the extended version."
1,"Wrong, wrong WRONG! Release the Blu-ray extendeds!!","These may be beautifully done, but I will NOT spend $$$ for this, only to have to spend even more $$$ to get the extended versions when they are released on Blu-ray."
1,Don't Buy,This is another studio double dip. I don't recommend buying it if you want the extended edition. Write to New Line and tell them to release the Extended at the same time.
1,Pointless and Insulting,"I am a HUGE fan of The Lord of the Rings, books and Movies. I have the DVD and Love it... Well the truth is I have BOTH DVD's. Why because they screwed people like me. They knew I couldn't resist buying the Theatrical version of the film only to find out on the dvd itself that they plan to release and extended cut of the movie for twice the price, which they also knew I could not resist.I KNOW they intend to release the extended versions on Blu-Ray, I will not be duped again into spending money I don't need to spend. When the Blu-Ray Extended Version comes out they can have my money freely, until then, its mine."
5,Awesome Purchase,I have always wanted to buy this DVD set since it became available. I am so glad that I finally did. I love these movies. It is an awesome purchase. WORTH YOUR DOUGH!!!
3,"Oh puh-leeze, if you haven't read the book...",".. you probably won't get the movie. It just can't and doesn't cover all the ground it needs to. Expect to get confused. And if you have read the book, you'll notice the errors they stick out like a sore thumb (for example, ANY scene with Liv Tyler's character... anyone seen Glorfindel?).Either way the story is nothing to write home about, but the effects are amazing. If you're a Tolkien junkie, this is an essential. The battle scenes - especially the Minas Tirith battle - probably makes it worth it, even if some of sequences (especially with Legolas) do get a bit cheesy.Also, there's no reason to get the box set if you already have the first two discs, there's no extra content in here."
2,bad service,"the DVDs were supposed to have Spanish subtitles, however the fellowship of the ring (box # 1) has just English subtitles... I even called AMAZON.COM before ordering to make sure about the product description on the amazon web page and I was told that indeed the DVDs will have spanish subtitles. but they don't. so I am not very happy with this order. I feel AMAZON.COM lied to me."
1,Not extended? C'mon. Seriously.,"Bringing out the Blu ray LOTR in theatrical version, not extended? Why? This movie deserves five stars, but the genius behind the plain version blu ray, you deserve to be fired."
1,Greed - Pure and simple,"Peter Jackson's involvement was not necessary to include a branching version of the Extended Edition cut on this same Blu-Ray. A technician fresh out of college with the ability to tell where to branch away could do it, while Jackson toils away at the Hobbit. There is no reason to release the BD set in this format but for a hope at quadruple dip instead of a triple dip. Stay away, if only for the sake of principle."
1,Theatrical?,"I purchased the Theatrical DVD's as they were all released, and then the Extended Editions when they were released. I will not do this for Blu-Ray. I won't get fooled again."
1,Blu-Ray discs can hold A LOT of data.,"Dual layer Blu-Ray discs can hold anywhere from 50 to 100GB of data. This set includes 9 discs. That means that up to 900GB worth of data could be included in this set. Enough to, at the very least, hold the Extended Editions and then use the branching technology that even previous DVD versions have used? No, this set exists for the sole purpose of making a quick buck because they know that it is inevitable that people will buy it for the sake of having LOTR in high-def. Even with us fighting against this release. I personally will wait for the Extended Trilogy."
1,wait for the next one,like star wars movies the LOTR trilogy is endlessly released and re-released on home video. obviously there will be an extended blu-ray soon so please do yourself and everyone else a favor and don't buy this. not buying it is the only way to send the message that fans and all consumers do not like to be cheated.
1,Extended please!!!,"I vastly prefer the Extended Versions. I am a big fan and it will be hard for me to wait, but buying this really only encourages the studios to continue to rip us off this way."
1,Come on New Line,You should be ashamed of yourselves but obviously are not. This is typical corporate nonsense!
5,A Must Have!,"This 12 disc set is amazing. 2 discs each for the 3 movies, and 2 discs each for preproduction/production/post production information.I used to think buying movies with special features (i.e., movie in the making peeks) was just a waste of money, but being a LOR fan I just had to have the extended edition set, and, Lo and Behold! ..I had as much fun watching the special features and it made me appreciate the movie more. My husband wasn't much into LOR (he isn't a 'reader'), but now he's a fan as well. We found everything else on TV boring after watching it when we got it for Christmas.Plus, you can watch the movie 4 times more with different audio commentaries from cast and crew. It was worth it!"
1,Rip-Off!,"I agree with all the rest: the extended versions have already been put together by Peter Jackson; it should NOT be a problem to produce the Blu-Ray version without his direct involvement. This is a cash-grab, plain and simple. DON'T fall for it! Wait for the extended versions!"
1,Don't get fooled - Shame on you Peter,There is not reason why the extended editions are not being made available now. This is a rip-off and all concerned should be ashamed.Do not buy! Wait for the extended version.
1,When is enough enough?,Release both. I think you have made enough money on the movies and previous DVDs!!
1,Pathetic,"Unacceptable abuse of your customers New Line.The shear demand for Blu-Ray or HD-DVD when the DVD Extended came out, and then this is the way you treat us.I wish you bankruptcy!"
1,Waiting for Extended Editions,"No way I am letting the studios double dip again. I already did it once for the DVD versions, but not again. It's a real shame because so many people have been waiting for this Trilogy on BluRay. I really hope they reconsider and release the EE at the same time, or even better yet add it to these disks and release it bundled together. This theatrical only release and a possible 2 year wait for the Extended versions is a monumental disappointment."
1,Corporate Greed At It's Best,Instead of buying this product take the money and donate it to the USO. They make life better for the people that protect all of us regardless of political persuasion. Then when they release the extended versions on blu ray then buy that product...
1,Supporting the cause...!,I actually just want to buy the theatrical version (blue ray) of this freakin awesome movie! But I refuse to buy it until the extended edition is released. I totally support this cause and think that not releasing the extended edition with the theatrical ed AGAIN! Is an insult to us (the public)and encourage everybody who feels the same way to NOT BUY THIS BLU RAY VERSION until the extended edition is released.
1,Are you kidding me!!!,"Well, I am not the biggest fans, but I have to agree with the majority here. You released the DVD versions separately and than the extended. Why do that with the blu-ray versions in the first place. In my opinion, the company is just going to be losing money over this. Why not give us what we want??? I plead with everyone to wait till they come out with the extended versions on blu-ray and not to waste your money on the theatrical version. Again this review is based on the product and not the actual movie itself. The technology is there, so please give us want we want!!!"
5,"Sorry, I could not wait! Got Blu-ray! Love it!","I have been waiting for LOTR in high def since I saw the Fellowship at the theaters. I started watching Fellowship last night and had to stop in the middle,because my eyes dried out from not blinking. Too much to see with all the detailpopping out all over the place! I purposely have not watched my extended version DVDs in months in anticipation of this release and as I watch the theatrical version, I do not notice or miss any ""additional scenes"". I apologige for notcriticizing the movie makers for wanting double and triple dip profits, but I feellike I got what I wanted. Do you really want to wait another year or so to view the trilogy in blu-ray? And no, I do not work for Warner Bros."
2,Format is bad for this much money,HiI anxiously open my 'Lord Of The Rings' package and played the Fellowship of the rings just to find out that this supposity 1080P version produced Black fill-in lines on the top and bottom of the screen!! This really sucks for this expensive a movie. I have the best 1080P LED TV and the best Sony Blue-Ray player and the last thing I wanted to see are the Fill-in lines on the top and bottom. These are usually associated with standard formats played on 16x9 format TV's!ps. My new Avatar fills the WHOLE screen.I believe I got ripped off on The 'Lord of Bad Formats'!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Wait for Extended Edition,"We are all pissed that New Line is offering only the theatrical edition on Blu-Ray. It's a huge money grab. They know we all want the Extended Edition, but they are trying to squeeze more money out of us by only offering the theatrical version first. Let's tell them where to shove it!Don't buy this product, and give it poor reviews. Instead, give high reviews to the Extended Edition, sign up to be notified when it ships ... and then wait."
1,"Greedy movie studios, dont ya love em'??!!","The one star is for New Line, not the movie.They could very easily have put both cuts on one set with the extras.Instead, they want to milk the cow for all it's worth.They think the fans will buy it, then double dip for the extended cut.Well, I have bad news for New Line, lots of folks will boycot."
1,Boo!,How can you expect fans to watch this movie in the short version after having it in the long. Shameless! Especially when the only reason it is being done is to sell it twice!
1,Yes we won't get fooled again,"Yes I agree with most of the other reviews. The definitive version to watch is obviously the extended version( which I just finished watching over 3 days). It was a joy to behold again. Sad to see that they got it wrong by releasing only the theatrical version. I'm prettty happy with the quality of the extended version DVD and it looks great on my new 52 inch flat, so I can't say for sure I would buy the extended play on Blu - ray , but I know I will not buy the theatrical release."
1,Same Old Line from New Line,"Hello, New Line. For your efforts here's a single star. You'll earn a few more when you do what's right for the consumers: release the Extended Version. The economy being the way it is, don't expect too many being duped into wasting their hard earned money."
1,Give me the extended version!,"Film companies should cherish us, the first-release buyers! Not trying to cheat us of our money again with a better later version."
5,I loved it.,"This is my first time buying it. I rented one video several years ago. and wasn't overly impressed. But when I saw the extended version coming out on DVD, I ordered it. It's packaged beautifully. The DVD is terrific. The art and scenery beyond the imagination. I read the books several times years ago, but had forgotten many of the names and the meanings in Elvish, but I still had plenty of books around to refresh my memory, such as The Complete Guide to Middle Earth, and a few Elvish dictionaries which were very helpful..It's great. What more can I say? Everybody knows the story line, no need to explain. I especially enjoyed all the commentaries and most of all how they made Gollum. one of my favorite characters."
1,Extended Versions,"another vote for the extended versions. I fell for this the first time and it's not happening again, stop nickel and dimeing us New Line!!!!"
1,Not Extended. Not Interested,"I personally have no issue with this version of the trilogy. My issue is that thye are delaying the extended version so this one will sell more. Screw you!the fans want the full exteneded cut, and you make us wait to pad out your wallets. I will not uy this set, and I hope no one else does.Poor form, and typical money grubbing from the bean counter brigade."
1,Disgrace to double dip,Hollywood deserves to crash and burn. It's hard to believe all the libs there point their fingers to the right when talking about greed.
1,No Extended -- No Buy,"Even though I think that the last movie is better in the theatrical version, the first two are miles better. I will wait until these jerks are done double dipping and get the version with seamless branching to allow me to watch the version I want. I will NOT buy these and if YOU don't as well, MAYBE they will get the message."
1,A waste of time and money,Stay far away from this release and show them that we will not be taken for fools. The release of this edition with not option for an extended edition is a slap in the face to anyone that loves these movies.
1,Looks like i'm not alone,"By the looks of the number of 1 star reviews, i am not alone in thinking the extended editions should have been released with seamless branching so that one has a choose in watching the theatrical or the extended editions of these awesome movies. Why not just release the extended editions??? Charge a bit more if you have to but this is a really bad move on Warner/Peter Jacksons part."
1,Great movies bad product.,Like the others I would recommend saving your money and waiting on the extended edition.
1,not extended - dont waste your money!,"OK so dont waste your money on this - its not the extended edition so that means that they will be coming out later and charging more for itI hope that they get the message seeing as near 1000 people have said the same thing hereI will just pirate these off bittorrent when someone rips them if I want to see the non-extended edition in HD, but there is no way I will pay for something 2 times let alone 5 - there are at least 3 dvd releases that I know of and now there will be at least 2 bluray releases and maybe even a 3rd one unless we get the message across to New LineNew Line, eat $h!t and die! - or live, that would be better since we can say ""hey thats the company that ate $h!t"""
1,No Thank You,"Fool me once, shame on you. Try to fool me twice... that's just glaring corporate greed. The movies have been out for years. There is no excuse not to release both versions at the same time, except to exploit the ignorant. New Line is crapping in our hands and calling it a Sundae. Not this time. Prepare for for an Epic Fail."
1,Complete nonsense (aside from the obvious $$$ for the studio),"I understand that double dipping is a great way for studios to make money on the DVD/Blu-ray releases. However, when a superior version of the LOTR trilogy already exists on the LOTR Limited Edition DVDs, why would anyone buy an inferior product on Blu-Ray? If you own a Blu-Ray player and a HDTV, then you can watch the extended editions of the movie in 1080p anyway with a good enough HDMI cable. It is complete nonsense not to release the extended editions of LOTR on Blu-Ray as the definitive version to own."
1,What a Joke!,Oh yea....im really going to buy this release instead of waiting for the extended release. BAH!
1,Join the boycott,"This is pretty brazen for New Line to try to rip off the fans like this. Maybe they thought nobody would notice? I'm sure they'll sell some copies, especially to the Walmart crowds. But what good does it do them if their core fan base is pissed off?"
1,Lord of the rings,"We were not happy with the product. On everything it said that it was dvd's but when we opened it everything was blue ray. So we did not have a very happy 11 year old on his birthday. I am very glad we bought it thru amazon (they were selling it for someone else) and not just anyone, because amazon paid for our shipping back to them and credited us back our full amount."
5,Lord of The Rings Trilogy (Extended),"I absolutely loved the extended version, it's like watching the movie for the first time. Even more I loved the service, the package arrived earlier than expected and in impeccable quality.Thank you."
1,This is an insult,"We were scammed with the theatrical vs. extended releases on DVD and now they are trying it again on BluRay. I'll buy the extended editions on BluRay, I loved the movies and love having more to watch, but there is no excuse for releasing the theatrical edition on BluRay except to try to sneak in some sales of people that are buying it for a gift or people who don't realize the difference until it's too late.Also it has been reported that Warner Bros. had employed an aggressive high frequency noise filter on the recording and the fine detail that should be present is smoothed to an air brushed look. Search the web for screencaps.This is a poor attempt at a money grab."
1,An Obvious Majority,"I share the sentiments of just about everyone here, in that this is just another play for money. I was willing to yield for the standard and extended editions on regular DVD, because for the most part, extended editions usually require extra work to complete even after the movie is sent to theatres. This, however, is truly nothing more than a handful of corporate blowhards thinking that the general public is dumb enough to say 'Hey, we already own both versions of LOTR, but we don't have it on BluRay, so let's buy it and then buy it again when they release the extended versions!"". I have my doubts on most people, but I imagine not everyone in the world is dense enough to fall for this kind of crap.I'll be sitting on an extended edition BluRay release (which in reality, the regular DVDs scale quite well in a BluRay player, so it really doesn't even matter), whenever that may be."
1,Insulting Double-Dip,"DON'T BUY THIS! WARNER BROS WANTS YOU TO PAY TWICE. ONCE FOR THESE, AND AGAIN FOR THE EXTENDED EDITIONS. LETS TEACH THEM A LESSON.VOTE THIS DOWN!"
1,No Thanks . . .,"Not me . . . I've been ""double-tapped"" before. Not for nothing, but the standard DVD's look pretty darn good - so there is no rush. I'll wait for the extended editions."
1,why?,just adding another voice. i do not support this release this is bs. Release the extended edition!
1,"No extended, no sale...","There is absolutely no reason this Blu-Ray release shouldn't include BOTH versions of the film. This is yet another attempt by a studio to rob the public ... luckily a good number of people have finally caught on to this ploy.The extended versions of all three films are, without a doubt, superior to the theatrical ""cuts"" ... as some content doesn't even make sense in the theatrical cuts of the film. So, why should I buy this version when the extended version is better and complete? The short answer is, I shouldn't, and neither should you."
1,"Yeah, count me in",It's shameful not to release the extended versions in Blu Ray and fooling people into purchasing an incomplete product again.Shameful!
1,Really? Doesn't everyone know better?,We all know the extended editions are coming. Who is going to bother with this set?Blu-Ray FAIL.
1,How gullible do they think we are?,"I prefer the extended versions. But, even if I didn't, I wouldn't understand why they can't release both simultaneously. I mean, just how stupid do they think we are? Then again, I did fall for this swindle with the DVD releases. But never again!When you treat honest customers who actually WANT to pay you money for one of your products so shabbily, and you keep a product hostage until an inferior version has sold ""enough,"" you build a culture of animosity and disrespect between your industry and the populace at large. This happened with the recording industry, and look where that got them."
1,Completely Ridiculous,"I think that its completely ridiculous for them not to release the Blu-RAY extended version when the DVD version has been out for years.Unless there is a strong rationale behind this, which I'm sure they don't (apart from profits and timing the extended version with the 'hobbit'), this is a complete exploitation of fan loyalty.If indeed they were thinking for the fans by providing the option of the 'theaterical version'; then both versions should be released the same time.By releasing the extended version at a much later date (1-2 years from now), many fans will be tempted/teased into buying a product they are not completely satisfied with, just so that they get can the blu-ray experience they have been craving for so long..Such abuse should not be tolerated and I urge all fans to boycott this product, only then will they understand that ultimately, corporations are standing on the shoulders of giants (the FANS)...."
1,Quadruple Dipping.,"The movies themselves will always remain a masterpiece, but for the Studio to release this version on Blu-ray and not the extended version is just ridiculous. I hope the consumers ignore this version, because you know the extended version will be released on Blu-ray, probably around the time ""The Hobbit"" hits theatres."
1,Lord of the Rings,"Does not pay on my Blue Ray TV player. Found out once I bought it that it plays only on a computer. My computer is a Mac, which does not play Blue Ray discs. So this is useless."
1,rent it and buy the ext.edition later,yes just like all the fans who enyoyed the dvd release i look forward to watch it in hd...but i just rent it
1,Two Thumbs Down for the Marketing Wizards,Guess I'll be watching my extended version DVD's on my blu-ray player for a couple more years. That's OK -- I'm a patient fellow.
1,Fooled Again?,"I'm sorry but I will not be fooled again like I was on the DVD's. I totally agree with those who are tired of getting raped by the movie industry. This is a fine movie and even though I don't buy many movies for the home, this is one I am willing to purchase ONCE when it is produced in the extended edition. This one can stay on the shelf and collect dust for all I care. Stop treating us like fools. We are tired of it!"
1,Agree with all other 1 star reviews,Should include extended versions of the films. I already own 2 versions on DVD. I don't want 2 more on bluray. Stop double dipping greedy movie studios. I will not buy this version nor will I let friends and family buy it either.
1,If i die before the long version is released on Blu -> It YOUR fault.,"Is there any reason to not release the long version now. Yes, greed... Thats pathetic!"
1,Wait for the extended version,GREED GREED GREED. Don't buy this. The extended versions are coming soon and that's what we all really want.
1,Fool me once...,"Shame on me - for purchasing both the theatrical as well as the Directors cut. I did just that for the regular DVD version. There is such a great and beautiful difference between the two - there is no doubt I can wait for the Directors cut. Actually, I can't wait - PLEASE abondon this madness and get the Dirctors cut out ASAP."
1,Wait,Wait for the Extended Version to be released in Blu-Ray. This is ridiculous that they would release the theatrical instead of the extended version. No wonder so many people are ticked off.
1,Milkin' it again?,"How many times are they going to try to sell this movie? I'm surprised that they're not releasing it as 3 separate movies still, in both versions"
1,Don't do it.,"When LOTR originally came out on DVD, I was extremely excited and jumped at the opportunity to buy it for home viewing. A while later, the extended edition came out and of course I had to purchase that too. It was rather annoying, but I learned my lesson. I waited for the extended editions of the others to come out before purchasing them. All these years later, it's pretty frustrating finding out that the studio is trying to pull the same stunt to milk fans once again. It's not going to fly, and I'm happy to contribute to the large number of 1-star reviews.Also, I heard the DNR is bad in this BR release."
1,This is insane,I totally agree with all the other reviewers that this is a ripoff by the producers. Furthermore I have never really appreciated the theatrical versions. Today when I watch them I always watch the extended versions and those are the ones I will by on BD.
1,What a rip off,I am also one of the people here who ended up buying the theatrical version and extended version on DVD. I will not get cheated again this time. Shame on the studio for coming up with the same scheme for the blu ray version.
1,Outrageous!,"Why do film companies think they can exploit the public!!Save your money and wait for the real mccoy, the extended versions!"
1,No double dipping here.,I agree with the other 1000+ reviewers. I have my extended cut boxes. I will not upgrade to Blu-ray unless it is worth my spending the money. Theatrical versions? Really?
1,You know this is still going to sell like crazy...,...but it will sell at least one copy less because I will not be buying it without the extended editions.
1,Add the Extended to my Wish List! Guaranteed Sale when Extended version comes.,"They almost got me again. I bought each DVD when it released, the deluxe addition box set, the Extended DVD box set. Now we are going around this cycle again? How sad. If you want more money out of this series why not make a few more movies? You got one more sale out of me when the Extended Blu Ray version comes out."
1,Here's how to get them back,"To best way to show the dismay of this release is when the extended versions are released DO NOT buy them right away. Just wait a few weeks after that release and it might send a message, albeit for a short time, that the consumer will not put up with this anymore. Let them get the first and second week reports and see their title coming in 10th place for one of the biggest franchises of all time.I watched my extended editions over the weekend and they still look pretty damn good and sound pretty damn good for DVD. I can wait"
1,Shake Down???,"C'mon, this is almost as bad as the Star Wars series.I have purchased enough copies of this trilogy already, I'm going to wait for the extended edition to be released."
1,DONT FALL FOR IT!,"Dont purchase this non-extended set on blu-ray! The extended edition will be coming out shortly and they just want you to purchase the regular, then extended AGAIN! Don't fall for the trap. Wait for the extended to come out. Let the movie industry know we don't want this to be the trend. -we wont purchase"
1,Greed... just Greed,Well I guess with all this 1-star review. It costs Peter Jackson as much as it costs me (my mistake) of buying 2 versions (theatrical and extended). I will not by this theatrical version (aka. short version). Hope Mr. Jackson's greed drove this release into a financial fiasco (as he did to general public few years ago).
1,Don't Buy! Not extended version.,"Hopefully, the more people that speak out the sooner Hollywood execs & markerters start listening. What a rip off! If they want to sell this, release it in the extended version. Nuff said."
1,Terrible waste of my time,"I gave this one star because it doesn't have the extended versions. The source material is already available and they shouldn't make us wait. I'll stick to the EXTENDED DVD versions of this movie. If you agree with this review, click I AGREE and write your own one star review to stick it to the studios."
1,Great movie - poor release,"Where's the extended version? This is a ploy to get people to buy the theatrical release, then want the extended release when it comes out."
1,news as to extended,"director Peter Jackson gave some insight into the upcoming Blu-ray releases of 'The Lord of the Rings'. He was able to not only confirm what we already knew, that the upcoming Blu-ray release of 'The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy' would present the theatrical versions of the films, but also that the Extended Editions of the films would be available on Blu-ray next year.According to Jackson, the studio has already spoken to him about developing additional extra content for the 'The Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition Trilogy' Blu-ray release. This new content would presumably be added to the content available on the existing 12-disc DVD box set for the Blu-ray releaseUntil then not a chance on this one!"
1,DON'T BUY LET THIS PRODUCT DIE,"This is getting ridiculous. First the theatrical version... then the extended. Now the same thing over again on Blu-Ray? Seriously, we don't need to spend all our money on this many different versions! Just release something that has EVERYTHING on it. Those Blu-Ray discs can hold 25-50 gigs, don't try to fool me into thinking they can't. It is insulting."
1,Don't be fooled! They are delaying release of Extended Version just to get more money!,"It's so obvious what they are doing - They already have the extended version on DVD, so it would be easy to release on Blu-ray along with the theatrical version. The fact that this does not include the extended version is a total rip-off and makes me very angry that this is how they treat their loyal fans, of which they know they have many. It is completely disrespectful of the fans and I am disgusted with them for releasing the movies this way. I hope fans will be smart and wait for the extended version and show them they made a grave mistake, but I have a feeling that many idiots (not the true fans) will buy it without even thinking or caring about sending a message to the Hollywood rich. This is all about the money... as if they don't have enough already. It's truly pathetic and a poor showing for this incredible movie trilogy."
1,Wait for Extended Release,"I would give these films very high marks, but the extended editions are superior. There is no reason the studio hasn't released the extended editions at the same time so that we have a choice, other than a misguided attempt to maximize profit which is in fact alienating the consumer."
1,Lord does it sting,"Are you kidding me, no extended edition. We had to wait this long for rehashing the same theatrical trailer trash. I think we can all agree Peter Jackson must be in need of another throne made of hundred dollar stacks to complete his dining room set. But he won't get another inch from me until the release of the extended editions on 25gb of blu ray paradise."
1,this edition must be under 40$,this its not the definitive edition of these films in blue ray format. at least give a cheap price!!
1,Enough is Enough,"I've got to agree with everyone else. No doubt this will be immediately followed the full extended Director's Cut version and in Blu-Ray. The ""GAME"" of tricking people into buying these films twice needs to end. WE as consumers are the best entity to force a change in Hollywood from this greedy and shameful practice. Boycott not only this attempt to tap us twice but any and all other attempts from other studios. Unless, they can release the full extended Director's Cut of ALL films right out of the gate (and they definitely can) then we shouldn't cave in to their request to first purchase the shorter abbreviated versions of these films. The practice of just a few months later suddenly dangling the superior version needs to end.PS: Where the heck is STAR WARS?"
5,Love these movies and the extras,The movies are excellent--it's a great story with real depth and very good characters. The special effects were exceptional and did not overshadow the story. I'll enjoy watching these again and again.
1,Not Paying Twice For One Product,"It's already been released on multiple DVD releases, asking us to pay for a Theatrical version is a bit much for me. I won't do it despite my love for LOTR, you won't get a penny from me for this version."
1,Don't buy. This is an outrage! Where's Extended Cuts?,This is only the theatrical release. New Line is tricking you into buying this release and then re-buying extended when it releases probably a year or more from now. Original trilogy was available 5 years ago and were just now getting blu-ray. RUBBISH!
1,No way! I'm with the others willing to wait!,"I will wait for the extended version! I almost ordered this, until i saw the reviews! I have all of them on DVD (Theatrical Ver) and i don't know that there's an extended version on DVD in which I don't think I would buy anyways because I don't want to get It in the same format (DVD). But now it's out on Blu-ray, I do agree with the others that I might as well wait for the extended version."
1,Trilogy Tragedy,"As we all know these Films are fantastic!! But the studios need to give the customers a break. Just use the Blue Ray for what it was meant to be used for. Just release the Bloody Extended Versions in one Trilogy and be done with it. Like others have stated in previous reviews, why overkill the release when most of us already have these films on regular DVD. This behavior is one of the reasons why there is such a Piracy issue in the industry."
1,I won't buy until the extended edition is released on Blu Ray.,"My family absolutely loves The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I like the idea of buying all three movies and the extra features on Blu-Ray, but I won't buy until I can buy the extended versions. We have both versions on DVD, we don't need them on Blu-Ray. We never watch the theatrical versions, so there is no point to it. I hope the studio doesn't hold out forever. I think it is a dis-service to the fans who made these movies block busters."
3,Not gonna be sucked in by the Theatrical Release,I see industry shills are trying to counter the bad reviews. I gave this 3 stars before I found out that it was only going to be the Theratical Release!!!I'm not going to be sucked in and buy this version knowing the Extended version will come later.I hope New Line isn't so arrogant and 'past minded' that they think the internet won't have an affect on their sales.Wal-Mart won't sell enough to make up for the deficit caused by the bad reviews on the internt.
1,LOTR Extended or Nothing,Like others have already said I too hope for the extended release on blu-ray. I will not repurchase this series on blu-ray until it is available as the extended release version. The extended version is superior to the theatrical release which I gave away ages ago. Epic fail if this is released as a theatrical release only. Furthermore I hope it comes in a nice boxed set with new ceramic figurines to add to the collection from the first extended release.
5,Couldn't be better,One of the best movies EVER!!! Every minmute that was added to the original screen version is an improvement.
5,Absolutly Amazing!,"After watching these DVDs I'll never watch the ones I had bought when the movies came out on DVD. The added scenes give you more insight into the world of LOTR thats why If you've read the books you'll especially love these movies. It was well worth the money I paid, plus the DVDs are packaged very nicely."
1,Extended editions or no sale,"Sorry.. not going to fall for this. Release the extended editions and let everyone have a choice. Dont play your fans, its bad karma!"
1,Not what i was hoping for,I thought that they would realese the extended versions but i was wrong. I cant even watch the theatrical versions anymore because im so used to the extended versions.
1,No Extended Edition = NO SALE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sorry Mr. Studio Exec, but there is NO reason on this planet why you couldn't release the Extended Editions of these movies now, instead of years down the road. Even though I'm a fan of these movies, I will NOT be buying this set.Let's just hope that George Lucas doesn't try to do the same--releasing an initial, bare-bones version of ""Star Wars"" on Blu-Ray first, then a ""Deluxe Box Set"" a year after, then ""Super Deluxe Box Set"" the year after that."
1,If it were only possible to rate stars to the nearest .00000001,"Seriously, how stupid do the people at New Line (or whoever is in charge of products) think people are? No wait, bad question... Rather, how stupid ARE the people at New Line (or whoever is in charge)? I can't wait to see poor sales reports for this product. There are no excuses for releasing half-baked products. Blu-rays can easily hold both extended and theatrical versions. And seriously, it's taken New Line this long to have blu-ray editions made? Come on, keep the 1 star parade going. Give us the complete package!"
1,Way to be Dbags with this Non Extended cut waste of time & money.,"Went to the George Lucas Dbag school of wasting fans time & money & not actually giving them what they want. Trying to bleed them dry when there is no reason you cannot relaes both versions now. The theatrical was made with the cuts so the theaters would play it, otherwise from the length, they wouldn't. There was & is no reason to wait & release only the nuetered versions only."
1,Just adding to the fire,"I've been waiting several months for the Notification when it was going to be available on Blu-Ray. Here i am getting all excited when i finally get that notice in my email. so I log into amazon, and find that its the Theatrical version only. WHAT-A-SHAME. Like most others that have posted responses, i bought both versions on DVD as well. I'm giving it a 1 star because this is a Pimp Slap in the face of fans - ""where's My money Bi$%h"". wont have no part of it."
1,Give us the Extended,Dumb... they need to release the full version. This is a complete waste of time and money... we ARE WAITING!!
1,Also waiting for the Extended Cuts version,"The Extended Cuts were so much more entertaining and complete. I will, as will so many others, wait for those versions before I buy."
1,Waiting for the xtended version release,"I will not be buying both versions again, I'll wait for the extended version release"
1,Another NAY vote...join the movement...cast your dissatisfication,"To be clear...LOTR, the movie is 10 stars in a 5 star system. LOTR BR, theatrical release package is -10 stars in a positive 5 star system. I will not buy this. I will immediately buy the extended release package. I encourage all that read these Amazon reviews to cast your vote as well. Amazon has clout, if they can't sell their theatrical BD inventories, NewLine will hear about it from someone they can't ignore, like they do us individually."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"Do NOT buy this version of LOTR on Blu-Ray. Wait for the extended Edition to come out. I heard a rumor that the extended edition isn't coming out on Blu-Ray until 2011. But that is just a rumor. Anyways, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
1,Don't Trick Us Again,"New Line, You Already Tricked Us The First Time, Please Launch The Extended Edition Already Instead Of Theatrical Release, So People Do Not Buy This Unless Extended, Have You Noticed That Warner Is Doing The Same With Harry Potter?"
1,Nope.,"Sorry, won't be buying this. Like anyone else that has seen the extended versions (and yes, they are better then the regular versions by leaps and bounds) i'll wait until they release them on blu-ray. I find it interesting that with the storage capacity of Blu-Ray disc that New line refuses to make use of the space the first time around. Very curious..."
1,A transparent maketing move,"Give me one logical reason why the ""non-extended"" version of the Lord of the Rings should be released on Blu-Ray, and then (inevitably) followed up with the extended editions. I can only think of one. Money. I whole heartedly dislike this move by the studio. I love the movies, but hate this tactic."
1,I'll wait for the extended cut,Why buy this when the extended cut will be released on blu at some point down the road?
2,Tolkeins masterwork finally on film,"And it has to be the most unemotional, least gripping and universally badly acted movies I have seen in a long time. Certainly the most overrated. Not a single actor is cast right, the direction is oriented towards showcasing CGI (wow, look what I can do!) and has no narrative momentum built up from scene to scene. What a wasted opportunity. Everything was available to make it right and they could not have screwed it worse if they tried.Stick to the books. They are brilliant and unforgettable."
1,Price Mistake,It is almost ten dollars cheaper to buy the three movies individually.That kinda makes this a bad deal.For those of us who enjoy money.
1,DVD without the language options advertised - watch out!,"In the product description its said the dvd is region 1 and has 3 languages: english, spanish and portugueseWhen I received the product the only subtitle or language option is english. Not even spanish was available in the menu...Don't let yourself be misleaded by this false product description!!"
1,Both versions...,"The theatrical versions will likely make the cut into the extended edition release as well.Buying this now is a waste. Though rumor has it we'll be waiting until around the time The Hobbit hits theaters.Go sign up for notification on the extended release...Those stills they have posted are very pretty...makes me excited, but the ps3 up scales my EE DVD's just fine...I can bare the wait..."
1,It's been long enough,The technology is there. Bleeding money from the fans does no good for us. They should just release the extended editions in combination with or as an alternative to the theatrical versions.
1,Rip-Off,What is this??? No extended version in BD. I'll be patient and wait for them to release the ex version
1,Why would anyone buy this? Release the extended version!,How much longer will they make people wait for the extended version? Do they really think that I will spend a dime on this?
1,not worth it,"we should wait til the extended version coming out. the extend version includes way more add-on scenes than this theatrical edition. i agree with other reviews. the more of us not buying the theatrical version, the sooner the extend version on blu-ray will be released."
1,Give both in one set you can do it,"I believe in you New Line. I love your BD releases, but hate you trying to torcher my wallet."
5,This is/will be a classic.,This is a must for any Tolkien fan. It will be counted among the epic classics.
1,I will wait!,"I will wait for the extended editions to come out. I don't need a fourth set of LOR at home, so I'll pass this one."
1,Here we go again,"Didn't double dip the first time around and I don't intend to start now...Time to send a msg, find another way to pick pockets."
1,Preposterous,"I nearly jumped out of my seat when I got the Amazon email announcing the LOTR trilogy would soon come to Blu-Ray.Click the link? What's this? Almost 2,000 1-star reviews of a product that hasn't shipped yet? Curious.I don't know if this crowd can truly move the studio to reconsider, but it's sure worth a try. Keep the 1-stars coming.And I'll close with the word in my subject line... most advanced, high-volume memory media available for home cinema? NOT including the option to enjoy the extended cuts on said uber-media? PREPOSTEROUS!"
1,Five star movie; one star theatrical release,Five star movie to be sure. Loved the extended editions on DVD. I agree with the other reviewers that releasing theatrical editions like this is shameful.
1,such a disappointment,considering how long I've waited for the blue ray versions only to find out that they are not the extended editions is disheartening. It's sad to me the blatant ripoff happening here. I agree with the the thousands of other fans here and I'm not buying this BS product and will continue to wait and wait and wait.
1,Also boycotting GREED,I will also be boycotting the theatrical edition. The technology is perfectly capable of allowing for both editions on the same disc.
1,i'm with you!,this is total b.s. - Peter Jackson should know that his fans are smarter than this! (maybe New Line went behind his back?). Anyway - I'll be waiting patiently until the REAL version comes out!
3,EXTENDED ONLY ON BLU-RAY,"We are all broke WB's! (now owns New Line) We don't have extra money to spend for every edtion, we already gave money for standard DVDs and sets etc. Not interested in the theatrical Box Set. I would buy each film as a sep film edition."
3,LOTR,I prefer the extended edition and will not be buying this. I would rather spend more money and receive both editions than to buy them seperately.
1,H*LL NO!,"For the love of God! I guess this can occupy the space next to my VHS set, DVD theatrical set, and DVD extended set.Why don't they just put out a LaserDisc edition to make my collection complete.I want the BR edition more than anything, but I refuse to buy a fourth, and then fifth edition of this trilogy.Stupid jerks! I'm going to go buy ten copies of the Ralph Bakshi LOTR animation just to spite you!"
1,I'll pass,"Like most of the folks here, I'm not even giving this set a look, much less a purchase. I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan, but I feel this is a slap to the face of consumers given the content capability of Blu-ray; both the theatrical AND extended edition of each film could EASILY fit onto one side of a single Blu-ray disc. Hopefully sooner than later the studios and manufacturers will understand that this economy will no longer support marketing schemes geared toward milking consumers chunk by chunk with products that should have been given more effort and quality to begin with. Give the consumers what they want (the best quality and value for the money), and they will be rewarded; if not our dollars will go elsewhere. I'm hoping that voting with our wallets now will create a precedent that will ensure future releases (the Star Wars series, Indiana Jones, etc) are done RIGHT from the get-go."
1,Help Us Peter Jackson!!!,"Every year around this time I get sentimental about the Lord of the Rings movies. Even though it's been 6 years since the Return of the King was released in theatres, I still feel anticipation and excitement, as if by some wondrous power a new installment of this eternal saga will be released this third week of December (as in times of yore).Alas, that chapter has ended, and the only joy I have left is for the inevitable release of this series in the extended (Platinum) Blu-ray edition. But where is it? It's been 5 years since the standard Platinum edition has been released! Blu-ray isn't a new technology. As many people have commented, we already have the standard editions - why buy them in Blu-ray? We want, dare I say ""need"", the Platinum (extended) Blu-ray!!! If NewLine is unwilling to forego their greed to support their fans, I have no choice but to appeal to Peter Jackson to take up our cause. Help us Peter Jackson!!!"
1,Big rip off,Don't buy this version. Watch your DVD's for now and wait until they release the extended versions. Don't let them get you twice.
1,Recommend to wait for extended versions,Why would anyone buy bluray version of a movie with no extras in it is beyond me. The extended version of the movie is not included in this version.Extended versions had the best scenes. I wouldn't pay for cost of high definition if I am not going to get extras.
1,NO,I'm sick and tired of companies thinking the general audience is stupid. This is just another way for them to get money go out party and celebrate that stupid people have been fooled into buying the same DVD twice. This will not be tolerated
1,Hollywood being Hollywood!!!!,It never seems to amaze me how Hollywood sometimes works. I'm so glad that finally people are opening their eyes to some of the hollywood con ways. Not buying this Blu-ray waiting for extended LAME Excuses to double dip on our pockets as usual.
1,Waiting for extended version,"I'll just keep watching the trilogy in HD from my DVR until they decide to release the extended version on BluRay. This is just silly, people aren't quite as stupid as they used to be."
1,Don't screw your customers,I've purchased this trilogy twice already. I'd love to have it on blu-ray but I certainly won't buy the theatrical release only to have the extended release hit when the movie studio decides they want another quick and easy revenue stream. Forget it. I hope nobody buys it. I'm so happy that so many people have taken the time to let the corporate stooges know their consumers aren't as stupid as they think they are.
1,Waiting for the Extended Version,"There is not much to say other than my recommendation is to just wait for the Extended Version. The movies are solid 5 in quality, but this theatrical version has to be rated the lowest because this is an unnecessary purchase. We fell the first time with the DVD and had to buy both versions, but not this time... lesson learned!"
1,Don't buy into their marketing scheme - wait for the EXTENDED version on Blu-Ray!,"This is a review of the product as listed (LOTR trilogy, THEATRICAL version) - NOT the movies themselves. The title of my review says it all: this is purely a marketing scheme to get people to buy multiple iterations of the movie separately. I'm holding out for the EXTENDED version."
1,Theatrical vs. Extended versions.,"Don't waste your time or money buying theatrical versions of this trilogy. If you're going to invest almost 10 hours for the theatrical versions, you might as well add 2 hours to that for the extended versions. Which, in my opinion, is well worth it. Skip this release, and look for the extended versions of the DVD. Or wait for the extended versions of the Blu-ray."
1,Thanks for the warnings everyone,"Thanks for the getting my attention with everyone's 1 star review. I will wait for the Blu-ray Extended edition to be released before buying the trilogy. Releasing something other than the extended editions, when we all have seen this content already on DVD, and pretty much expect it on Blu-ray, is purely shameful."
1,No Excuse,"There is no reason beyond a simple, greedy attempt to squeeze a bit more money out of the impatient or ill-informed consumer for not releasing the extended editions on Bluray. If Newline were to release both at the same time that would be acceptable but rather unnecessary given the that the majority seems clearly interested only, or at least primarily, in the extended versions. I, and many others who enjoyed the trilogy I expect, will be perfectly willing to purchase the movies again in high definition just as soon as the films are being presented in their entirety. As soon as such a release becomes a reality I will personally be changing this review to the five stars which it warrants in my judgment. Unless of course by that time Amazon has reworked the review system such that this review will not appear among those for the so far merely hypothetical true release. In such a case this review will remain at one star but will be edited to acknowledge the mending of Newline's ways."
1,And so it begins. AGAIN!,"Anyone has to admit that the double dipping that studios do on movies is outrageous. For a movie that made this much money it is twice as outrageous to double dip consumers to death! For those who complain about folks griping about the double dip, I say you can throw your disposable income my way or just throw 60 bucks in the street. I absolutely hate how Capitalism has caused the consumers who are actually getting screwed to stick up for the people screwing them! Since when did multi-million dollar film productions become the little guy? Come on people, the sooner consumers speak up in their own interests the sooner companies produce the highest quality and most economical products for the consumer. It's a simple case of supply and demand."
1,Insult to the fans,"It is a grave insult to the fans to try and pull off this stunt, my family already double dipped on the DVDs. Buying first the original version and then the extended version when it was eventually released. No way in hell are they going to dup me into wasting money on an inferior version when I know they will release better eventually and that this is just a shameless attempt to milk money out of their customers."
1,What they said...,Like everyone else has already said hundreds of times.The films = 5 stars.The greedy corporate Blu-Ray release of the theatrical versions only = 1 star.
1,Weak.,I'm disappointed that the Extended Cuts are pushed back to 2011 or 2012. That is truly weak on New Line's part. I will absolutely NOT be purchasing this trilogy on Blu-Ray in its present form.
1,Why One At a Time?,"You know we want both, and if I had the choice I would wanted extended only. I will not buy the theatrical release as I own the DVD's of the extended versions. If you release BluRay versions of the extended versions I will buy day one. It is on my short list."
1,Too bad there is no way to vote zero stars,"I had originally pre-purchased this item not realizing that it was the theatrical versions. As soon as I realized that, I immediately cancelled the order. I've waited this long, I guess I can wait another couple of years. Shame on them!"
1,Waste of money...,"Better wait for the Extended Version... If you got the Extended DVD version, stick with it..."
1,"Release the Extended Cut ONLY or better yet, include one set which contains both Theatrical and Extended Cut.","Release the Extended Cut ONLY or better yet, include one set which contains both Theatrical and Extended Cut. Don't waste your money on this version, wait for the extended cut."
1,Do not give the studio one cent of your money. Demand the Extended Versions.,"They take full advantage of people when the movie first hits release on the home market by offering the standard editions only, to make die hard fans buy both. Now that BluRay is around, do not give them the ability to do this all over again. Demand the Extended versions that have been available for years. We could have had this a year ago, had they not been transferring anything but the definitive version. Don't waste your money with the extended version coming right around the corner."
1,Don't waste your money,"This boxset will include Theatrical version, and you know the reason right? That's right, simply the greedy studios are planning to release later the extended editions so they can make more money out of you.So it's up to you people, destroy this release by not buying it! If their sales are low the studio is gonna realize they can fool you. If you buy it anyway, the studio will know they can do anything they want and you're gonna still buying their movies anyway.Don't buy this collection! and tell others to do the same!"
1,"Blow me, New Line","Not only will I not buy this, I'm not going buy the extended versions when they inevitably come out on Blu-Ray. Not if you're going to pull this same garbage on us again. I will not allow you to sodomize my wallet this time around and I will urge others to do the same. I hope nobody buys this and you get stuck with a warehouse full of them."
1,Wait for the extended version,"I don't think I need to say any more, it really sucks they make people wait so long for the bluray version that's not even complete."
1,GREED THATS ALL IT IS,How is this happening? If anything make it like 30 bucks cause this is a complete ripoff since later on your going to release the extended editions anyway
1,Money grubbing people,It's such a shame they're making us wait for the director's cut. I bought the whole director's cut twice on regular. Didn't they make enough the first time around?
1,"New Line, please stop being dishonest with your fanbase",I agree...the first time around selling DVD's and then releasing the extended version on DVD was enough. I am not going to buy Blueray LoTR twice.
1,Say NO to the Theatrical Edition,"You fool me once, shame on you! You fool me twice, shame on me! LOLThey are not getting me again to spend money on bothe editions, especially since there is sooo much more material on the Extended one."
1,Not Extended Edition = No Sale,"Just wanted to add my opinion that this set is a complete waste of money and that you should wait for the extended edition.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION: The fewer who buy this, the faster we'll get the edition everybody really wants."
1,"Give us a break, please.","I'm just chipping in to lower the rating of this product. Why bother with the theatrical versions? Everyone knows that the extended ones are better, which is evidenced by the crazy number of negative reviews this product is getting. Only people who don't fully appreciate these films care about the theatrical versions, and very few people that watch them don't fully appreciate them.Give us a break, New Line. There's no reason you can't release both versions at the same time."
1,Double-dip money eater,"When you have the technology to put both theatrical and extended version on 1 disc. What do you do? Make 2 products to double your profits! What a great way to milk a cash cow Warner!What's even more mystifying is to include DVDs for ""extra features."" Whats the freaking point! We already have those!"
1,I'll keep waiting,"I absolutely love the LOTR trilogy, and resent the heck out of the studo releasing only the basic, theatrical edition on Blu-Ray. With great sadness and not a little anger, I will pass this by and keep waiting..."
1,good but want extended version,"This set is good, but if u love it the way I do u cant get enough, so Ill wait for the extended version before I buy"
1,Release d extended version of the movie.,I agree with most of the users who have given a 1 star rating to the product and are absolutely right that the movie is 5 stars but not the product as everyone wants the extended versions instead of the theatrical versions. The producers of the movie want to double their profits but i wont give my money until they give me the extended version of the movie.
1,Waiting for the extended Blu-Ray Version,"Fooled me once, I won't be fooled twice. Will wait for the Blu-Ray extended edition."
1,Wait for the real thing,Well... One more for the crowd. No point in buying this one when eventualy they release the extended editions. The way it should have been.What... Pay some money now to get a 66% of a trilogy? No thanks. I'll wait.
1,Who bought this?,"Lord of the Rings is an excellent trilogy. I must say that Return of the King had to be my faviorte of the lot. Why do I rate this one star? Whats the point of having a two sided dvd? Put the regular movie on one side and the extended movie on the other side. Was that so hard to think of? They probably just needed some extra cash and didnt think of that idea. I bought the Extended editions to look cool for my dvd collection, but I lent the movies to a friend and left with just the cases. I realized that watching a movie and flipping over the dvd halfway thru the movie was stupid. I bought the regular versions instead of these sets. I'll put them in the extended cases so it looks better. Why would anyone want to watch a movie and get up half way thru it to flip it over anyways?"
1,epic fail,I want the extended editions. This insult makes me want to just keep my dvd set even after they eventually release the blu-ray ext. editions.
1,"The movie is great, the product is marginal","This is something you might grab off Netflix or another rental counter if you want to see it in High Definition, as in about a year, a extended edition full of goodies will appear for sale, and it is not worth buying this only to turn around in a year and buy a extended edition that will be a keepsake.The movies themselves are excellent modern day classic."
1,EXTENDED???,Hopefully someone was FIRED over the decision NOT to make these Blu ray versions EXTENDED! If not after poor sales hopefully they will be!!!
1,A blatant slap in the face of LoTR fans,"*continues to watch LoTR Extended editions on crummy DVDNEW LINE CINEMA APPARANTLY HATES US FOR LOYALLY BUYING THE OTHER EXTENDED VERSIONS OF THE FILM.So lets hate them back, whadya say? :)"
1,Another Attempt to Pull the Wool Over Fans' eyes,"We all know that these movies are really good, and worth the price or admission to own in Blu-Ray. The reason this set is not getting good reviews has nothing to do with quality, but rather it has to do with the quantity.This set is not the extended version (which is the new standard for these movies due to all the extra film) which means that over 3 hours of the three movies will be omitted. The worst part is that the extended versions will release soon enough, but presumably not until this set has made a mint."
1,DVD quality,"My friend bought these and brought them to my house since I have the 1080p television and Playstation 3 to unlock all the HD goodness...or so we thought. The ""HD"" version looks no better than the upscaled original version my PS3 is capable of rendering. In fact we found the HD version to be anything but HD. Some scenes look fuzzy and blury while others look fake (granted I know none of it is real). I was expecting these to blow me away with their overwhelming geeky-goodness but alas it was not meant to be. I have both the original DVD and extended DVD and think I will just keep my money. Maybe...just maybe I will rent the HD extended versions when they arive to see if they have improved the HD experience. Otherwise..."
1,Rediculous,Can not say any more than has already been said. I just wanted to add my general distaste for the cash grab.
1,Vote with your wallets!,"I have waited years for a proper HD treatment of the trilogy. If the studios think I am going to be fleeced again and buy 2 copies of the series they have another thing coming. There is no excuse whatsoever for not releasing the extended editions. I will not not be buying the Theatrical set and I would advise anyone else to simply wait. Judging by the other reviews on here, there are at least 3,000+ copies that will not be sold because of these stupid games."
1,Great movies - But.. Fool me twice.. No,"Ok, yes like everyone else I must agree.. Most of us fell for the double hit on DVDs and frankly I didn't mind it. The movies are good enough to warrant it. But again??? No that is just plain greedy."
1,I'll wait for the extended version,"While I'm pleased that the Blu-Ray version of Lord of the Rings is finally out after all these years, I can wait for the complete (extended) version of the movies, which I'm sure will be released right before Christmas. In the meantime, I'll sate my appetite for high-def Tolkien by renting these discs on Netflix, or by watching them on pay-per-view. ="
1,Just wait for the Extended Version on Blu-Ray,"Not sure why they would not put both the extended and theatrical editions on the same set. Easily done with blu-ray. Perhaps to get people to buy this twice. Disappointing. The Extended editions are the ones to get, don't waste you're time and money with this. You'll regret it when the extended editions are released on blu-ray."
1,Review = Petition,I just thought I'd add my 1-star to this review. Its becoming more like a petition for the Extended versions than reviews.
1,Blatant double-dip attempt,"I bought the theatrical and extended editions on DVD, and it was understandable, because it took extra time to produce the extra content for the extended versions, and so it was acceptable to have two different editions seperated by a year.This theatrical-only blu-ray version, however, is UNACCEPTABLE. There is no excuse not to have the extended versions out from the beginning because the extended content is ALREADY DONE. This is a terribly thinly-veiled money grab, and it is NOT going to work on me. I'm waiting until the extended editions come out on blu-ray, and that is the last penny they'll get from me."
1,I've Waited This Long,"Yes I was one of the dolts who purchased both the theatrical versions and extended versions of these great movies when they were released on DVD. Guess how many times I viewed the theatrical versions after I got the extended cuts, that's right a big fat goose egg. I won't be duped this time. I waited years for these movies to come out in hi-def, I can wait a little longer for the extended cuts."
