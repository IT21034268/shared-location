1,Confused,"Was really Confused by this book, Muslim Know who Jesus is they believe in Him & believe that he is coming back. And it didn't mention anything about what happens to the Christians who become Muslim? This book is very unfair & it gives the world the wrong impression of Muslims. Very sad when I read this book."
4,"Experiential, Not Theological","This book isn't for the person who wants to explore the way to evangelize, or even just understand, Muslims. Rather, it is the account of the subjective experiences of Muslims who were led to abandon their Islamic faith for faith in Jesus Christ. As some of the other reviewers note, one of the effects of the stories is to remind Western Christians how easy our faith lives are, and how flabby our faith is. Would we turn to Christ if faced with a little difficulty in life? How much less with imprisonment, abandonment, banishment, torture, or even execution!"
5,Captures the beauty of the sagebrush desert,"Finally, a book that captures the unique beauty and solitude of the Great Basin. This is the ultimate book for any naturalist who wants to know more about this large and little visited corner of the world."
1,Poor review,"Very disatisfied, product was incomplete and all torn up, from a very poor instalation. basically trashed and I was unable to use it."
3,adjustable periscope dryer vent,Had a little trouble getting it into the wall as it was the same diameter as the wall pipe. Put a slit in both at different spots and got it to work.
5,Such a beautiful sound,This air intake may add some horsepower (especially compared to the 100k mile filter it replaced) but the best thing about this kit is the sound your car will make with it installed. It makes my 06 Civic sound like a Lamborghini. The notes this thing allows you to hear is simply wonderful. I highly recommend!- Easy to install.- Butt dyno was pretty happy.- Beautiful sound.- No negatives at all!
4,Okay,"Pros:easy installation.good instructions.good quality.car feels smoother.Cons:doesnt sound as great as i heard on youtube videos. sounds stock with a little tone to it, hard to explain.instructions were good but couldve been better, had a few problems as a beginner.Other notes:Be very careful with the bolts. one got stuck and couldnt get it until i moved the car. be careful with the coolant as well. if necessary, ask someone for assistance with that part. i like the product but i wished it wouldve had that deep growl like ive heard on youtube videos. It is pretty much quiet until about 3k then it just gets a slight tone like i said above. its a good replacement for the stock only reason im giving 4/5 is for the growl that i am not getting that i hoped for. Take your time and dont rush. save old parts. and remember to have you car idle for at least 10 mins after you first start it."
5,One of the best 80's slashers you'll find,"Classic 80's horror... if you like films like April Fool's Day, My Bloody Valentine, Halloween II and Terror Train, this DVD should be sitting right next to all of them in your entertainment center. There are a few well-crafted scares, the plot is interesting, and the ""entertaining"" performances by Lee Grant and William Shatner are worth the low sticker price alone."
4,visiting hours,"love to see the closet sceen,with the pictures of the dead he has on the wall in his closet."
1,This movie should have been canned!!!,"Words cannot describe this intolerable movie!!! Grant is stalked by a sadistic killer in a hospital. If hospital horrors are your thing, stick to Halloween 2 and X-ray ( a.k.a. Hospital massacre)!"
1,tepid revenge flick,"If you crossed ""Halloween II"" with ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and subtracted the sex & nudity of the latter, you'd get ""Visiting Hours,"" a would-be horror movie that pits an outspoken TV personality (Lee Grant, in an awful performance) against a hulking, muscular freak who has a personal vendetta against her (although it's not made clear exactly WHAT that vendetta is). He attacks her in her home once, and when she's transferred to a hospital, there's even more chances for his deadly intent. Unfortunately, this is less a horror film and more a portrait of Humans Behaving Badly, with Michael Ironside doing a good job of being imposing and threating, but also unrelentingly unpleasant as a result. Jean-Claude Lord's direction sucks the suspense out of scenes, and in the end, ""Visiting Hours"" is just one big 'kill-or-be-killed' festival with the typical undercurrents of misogyny. Avoid it."
3,I bought it because I had a coupon,"Its ok, it comes with the 1/4"" launch rod only but will accomadate the 3/16"" maxi rod, I wish it would hold the 1/8"" so you wouldn't need to bring two launch pads to launch both kinds of rockets. The Aerotech launch pad is a much better pad, if you have the $$ get it."
2,Not the best launch pad on the market,"A friend of mine and I used one of these for a few years and it is not the most durable launch pad on the market today.The rod holder assembly is very weak. If you plan on flying some of the lighter weight Estes rockets such as the Eliminator and Executioner, it'll most likely work fine but if you want to fly Estes kits with the more powerful APCP (composite) rocket motors or larger mid power rockets like the Aerotech kits off this pad, forget about it!!!I personally would recommend the Aerotech Mantis pad over this one. Yes, the Mantis is considerably more expensive, the quality is much better and it will allow you to fly larger rockets off it.By the way, I finished off this Estes E pad by flying a saucer on an Aerotech G339N Warp-9 motor from the pad, sheared the legs right off. Good riddance."
2,"Melts really easy, and pointed towards the truck...","To much plastic.... I didn't have it too long and then a rocket got stuck on it and it began to melt. As it melted it pointed right towards the truck, causing some definite concerns! Burned a big hole in the metal plate too. About all that survived the desaster was the rod."
1,Launch delayed due to technical difficulties,The picture of the launch pad shows the rod going all the way thru the rocket. The rocket we purchased does not have a hole in the nose to go thru. And no instructions to snip it.Theres a plastic socket that you insert in the middle of hte pad and the rod is to be screwed into it and tightened for launch - we cannot get it tight. Rod keeps falling over.That and the frustration between the disconnect of instructions for pad and for rocket caused the launch to be scrubbed. Our NASA space project is cancelled due to lack of funding I refuse to put more money into these products.
1,"Nothing new. You can get it all at investopedia, etc","This course is nothing more than a sales pitch. The information is very, very basic. There isn't anything on these CD's that can't be found on the internet for free. This course is six hours of the most basic charts--ascending/descending triangles, channels, support/resistance, etc. Worse yet, the pro's know how to run the stops and limits on average investors who use these techniques. This is nothing more than a course on how to become frustrated as you lose your money."
1,Wonder Women Season one - Disk 1,One disc? $12.99 - How silly. What a surprise when I opened the package and realized I'd paid this much money for 1 disk. Who sells things this way?
1,Who sells one disk of 5 episodes for a TV series,I went from HAPPY it arrived to complete sadness when I saw it was 1 disc from season 1 with the pilot and 4 episodes. I can't give this a 1 star. $15 come on now... Take this product off of Amazon.
1,Wonder Woman first season,Warning do not buy! This must be a joke. Why say the first season when it clearly wrong I cant understand how you are still selling this garbage. It dose not say 1-4 on the flyer...........
1,NOT COMPLETE SEASON,"This product is grossly mislabeled. It is only 1 disc from the first season. While it is in fact labeled Disc 1, that is inadequate. They need to remove COMPLETE FIRST SEASON from the description.Other than that, Linda Carter as WonderWoman is great."
4,A good movie!,This movie i highly reccomend very entertainingthe guy Richard Thomas played was a real nut!
2,"Good movie, DVD quality very bad",Have been hunting for this movie for a long time and was happy to see it in stock. The DVD quality was terrible. It looked like the DVD was made off someone filming the movie off of TV. Some places were so dark in color you could not hardly see the picture. Wondering how to send this infor to the seller of these DVDs.
5,TV Movie from long ago,"Ah yes, one of the Waltons' kids gone bad....very bad. When VHS tapes were all the rage, I taped this show titled ""I CAN MAKE YOU LOVE ME."" The tape is starting to go bad, and thanks to the network gods who released this program on DVD, I bought it to replace the worn out tape. I'm not a fan of Brooke Shields...but Richard Thomas is worth the price of the DVD. And it is based on a true story. Thank you"
5,Very Entertaining,This movie delivers all of the suspense and thrills of a true tale of obsession. The cast was selected with perfection. I would highly recommend the movie.
4,The sound of agony,"There is only one way to describe Deinonychus: Pure agony.I don't mean that their music CAUSES pain. It's great stuff. It's just pure emotion, and that emotion is pain. If you like deep, dark, depressing music, you can't get much better than this. Incredibly heavy, and amazingly emotional. The screams, wails, and weeping is straight from a horror movie, with thick, heavy guitars and some crazy drumming holding it together. I don't recommend listening to this while you're happy, or it'll completely ruin your mood...and the effects could last quite a long time. And if you're generally a happy person, this music is dark enough to change your life."
1,Don't be fooled by this Cheap BAIT and SWITCH,"Buyer beware: The picture and the two positive reviews are for a great Tramontina machete from Brazil, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE BUYING HERE. I made the mistake of trusting the reviews and the picture (I used to have a Tramontina just like the one pictured, and thought that is what I was buying).The machetes you will receive are CHEAP Chinese JUNK. They are not sharp, will not hold and edge, and are just plain atrocious. The only yard tool I use regularly is a machete, and I know a good one. This one is not. Seymour has obviously decided to cut costs and switch to a Chinese manufacturer of inferior quality instead of the great Tramontinas they used to sell. Look elsewhere if you care about quality (and about time and effort wasted with dull edged-tools)."
1,False Advertisement,"If you look at the picture of the item above, you will find an 18"" wooden handled machete made by Tramontina in Brazil. I own several Tramontinas and love them. I decided that I would order 2 more from this company. After waiting more than a week to receive the machetes, I opened the box to find 2 junk Chinese made plastic handled machetes. To say that I was disappointed, is an understatement. The funny part is that one machete arrived in a plastic Seymour sleeve and the other in a cardboard sleeve. Keeping in mind they are identical machetes. The one in the cardboard sleeve even has a Tramontina clearly pictured on the cover. I have learned my lesson with this company and inthe future I will not order from them and will order from eknifeworks.com as I typically do."
5,Tasty flavored decaf,"This is by far the best flavored decaf I've ever drank. The smell and flavor are delicious without the chemical or burnt taste some decafs have. Now I just gotta get Perfect Potful to make k-cups, because I recently switched to that type of coffee maker. But I suppose they'd have to re-name them 'Perfect Cupful' then, wouldn't they!"
1,Do not buy this disc!,"I thought I was getting a good value with this CD. Although there are only 10 tracks, the price was reasonable and there were three songs I really wanted to add to my oldies collection on this disc. I bought the CD and within seconds of starting to play it, I realized THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL SONGS!! I was very disappointed. There is fine print on the back of the CD case which admits this fact, but I had no way of knowing it. The only reason the CD is not going immediately into the trash is that I want to remember the name of the label so I don't buy anything else from them.If you want the original songs, DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!"
4,Tale of Tails,"Tale of Tails is a clever play on words. It is a fun story about a fox who uses his tail to catch much desired fish. His friend, Bear wants some, but fox is too greedy to share and told Bear about his fishing method--to use his tale. Well, the fun of the story is what happens next. It is well written, and cleverly illustrated."
1,It's a $20 card - DO NOT PAY MORE,Don't get ripped off - It's $20 direct thru the Wii or at any retail store.
1,Waste of Money!!!,"The description says Nintendo Wii system required. Nowhere does it say that the internet is required as well!!! So imagine my suprise when I opened the package, went to the Wii Shop Channel and was told that I need to connect to the Internet to use this card. And I purchased 2 cards!!! I'm sure the cards are great but full details should be mentioned when selling items, especially when something like Internet is required!"
1,Don't buy it from here,"It makes no sense to buy this piece of plastic inscribed with a code, accreting an unnecessary shipping charge. Buy it in a store, or buy Wii Shop points through your Wii itself. Why isn't the code itself downloadable, like digital music? Why pay a shipping charge for a piece of plastic on which this code is printed? You could spend that $5 on 500 more Wii Shop points if you did it online! It makes absolutely no sense to buy this through Amazon.com!"
2,Scam except from amazon,"As long as you get this with free shipping and handling then it is fine, not a deal but not paying more. However do not buy from any other company claiming on selling it cheaper they simply over do it on shipping and you pay more. I f you don't like using your cards online go to your local Toys R Us store you can buy Wii points there. Wii points 100 points equals $1.00 U.S. Dollar. They come in 2000 point cards only so a max total price should never exceed $20.00 U.S. Dollars"
1,You can't keep the games you buy!,"We called Nintendo trying to switch our games onto a new system.We have spent a bit of money on these cards over the past few years. Our Wii quit reading games and so the only thing we played was the downloaded games. We finally got another Wii box and found out you CANNOT take the games you purchase with Wii points with you! I have heard other systems allow you to. You can take your Miis, your unused points but you lose every game.Anyway, thought you should be aware. It is money you will eventually lose.[...]Here is a link that states you cannot take games from one console to another. Straight from Nintendo's website. Click on SD Cards and Can I transfer from SD Cards to another console?"
1,RIP OFF!!,"For $20.00 you can get 200 points right on your Wii... What a price gouge, I would NEVER buy this item from Amazon at that price!! There normally priced at $19.99, even Wal-Mart has a better deal than amazon!Your not stealing my pocketbook sorry!"
1,wii points card,if ok to use if you don't have a debit/credit card but is really time consuming to have to input all the numbers every single time.
3,"In the end works, BUT.....","Despite some other comments about this item being kind of expensive on Amazon (At least mine was), be aware that compared to other scratch type cards (ie: calling cards, lotto tickets, etc)this card is kind of difficult to scratch without risking to damage the written numbers underneath the protective coating.I started scratching with a coin as I normally do on this kind of cards and for my surprise it was almost not peeling off at all, so when I increased the strenght and speed I ended up rendering the code unreadable on some characters. I started trying to guess the missing numbers until I was able to redeem my points on the Wii shopping channel, but I was too close to ruining it completely and loose my money. I was lucky this time.Shouldn't be that difficult and complicated to scratch and peel it off."
1,This is not a bargain,"At $24.99, Amazon is over charging by $4.99. At $19.99, you are saving a penny on the actual value of the card. The only reason I could see for not buying direct from Nintendo on the the WII shopping channel is not having a credit card. There it's sold value for value."
5,Wii Points GREAT !!!!!,Hard to find Wii points card at Christmas time but I found it here. And at a Great price. Love it !!!!
2,Is buying a card on amazon worth it?,"These Wii cards can be hard to find I'll admit. But those selling the cards charging them over $20 when the card itself is worth approx $20. (Every 100 points is equivalent to $1 for those who are unaware of this.) You can buy these points on the Wii shop channel if you have a credit card without shipping and handling or wait until you can get them in your local store.If you REALLY REALLY REALLY need a Wii card and none are available to you and you do not have a credit card(Or bank card), try looking somewhere that will charge more around $20 so you aren't literally wasting money."
4,Great Bag,"I got this bag for a 3 inch Celestron Refractor I bought years ago. I was very happy with it, its well put together and fits most of the scope. Its not designed for my scope but there is ample space in the bag to fit most items. Very happy with my purchase as I can travel to better viewing locations now."
5,Perfect,"This case is just what I was looking for.It is adaptable to any kind of small telescopes and, so, very useful. I keep my telescope in it all the time.Gerenal characteristics are: low weight (it is a very light case) and waterproof."
3,Could be better,The behind the scene interviews are great but the concert sound leaves a lot to be desired. Total Abandon is a petter purchase.
2,Not the powerfull Deep purple,"THis was not the power I knew of DP, Not abad set but Lacking something,"
1,Deep Purple without RITCHIE is not Deep Purple,How could anyone say this is Deep Purple. Without Ritchie Deep Purple does not exist.............. sorry to all the morse fans.
2,Casca Returns (but not as good as before),"I was very happy to see a new Casca book in the bookstore. I had greatly enjoyed the previous series and hoped that someone would pick up where Barry Sadler had left off. The setting was OK, but not very well developed and the history of the tribes was lacking. Way too many pages were spent on the sexual goings on of Casca and his three nurses. Some attention was paid to the tactics and strategy used by the tribes but overall it was dismissed as a madman's creation. I hope that the next author who makes a creative stab at writing more on this series can do a more credible job."
1,Will the real Casca please stand-Up!,"Synopsis: Casca gets aboard ship, drowns, visits Sub-Saharan Africa and saves city from a madman and the evil European Slavers (did I mention Africa?).Way too long of a book. Not a thing like Sadler's Casca. Lack of action, lack of feeling. Way to much description of dull, uninspiring trivia. The one good thing, it makes some of Sadler's worst prose feel inspired. In short, skip the book unless you have to have everything that has Casca's name on it."
2,Nice try but no continuity. Disappointing.,"I really enjoyed the Casca series and was excited when I first heard someone was trying to continue it. As I read the book, I became dissapointed especially with the first part of the book where Casca is trapped under a sunken boat at the bottom of the ocean. In other books with similar situations, Casca would have gone into a catatonic state of sorts. For example, I believe it was Casca: The Warlord where he was buiried alive and went into a sort of deep sleep. Another book where he got trapped in an underground river and was only 'awake' when his body surfaced in areas with 'air' pockets. So, while the parts about him waiting for a fish to swim close enough for him to catch and eat were mildly interesting, it really has no continuity with other events in the overall story line. That added to the slowing of pace in the middle of the story led to my overall disappointment."
1,A complete waste of money,"This was the worst 6 bucks I have ever spent. I had to force myself to finish this, thinking ""it has to get better"". After waiting ten years for a new book, this is an incredible disappointment. The author cannot write or tell a story. There's only filler. The author gives complete details about the bathtub, but leaves out little things like when and where the story is taking place or what happens to the Oba at the end of the book, but then again, maybe he did, but I was too bored to notice or care. This series used to contain nonstop action, not this constant introspection. He made Casca sensitive.To the Publisher:1)Pay some real money for an author who can write!2)Hire some editors. Not only were there inconsistancies on the same page, but spelling errors as well."
2,A good try but just not Sadler type storytelling!,"I was thrilled to see a new Casca Book after all these years, but getting halfway thru this book I found myself speedreading thru it just to get it done! Now this guy's writing is good and he captures Casca's mood and his very being greatly, its just a very slow-going storyline. The beginning was real good but as soon as he got a couple of broads - it was dullsville! There just wasn't enough movement, action/adventure like Sadler would give you. This writer ought to write another one but keep it flowing and write the action scenes better. The action seqences were too broad and not personal enough like sadler made them. Casca himself though was well written and was the ever soulful-soldier and you felt sorry for the guy but there was just too much lovestory for me. Sadler's love storylines were some of his best writings but he didn't bog it down. I want to see more Casca but I just dont want to wait for something to happen!"
5,Unexpectedly well written and entertaining,"The original Casca was exciting, but a bit boiler-plate, a Conan without steroids. This new author has one-upped Sadler with two new facets -- a strong sexual undertone, and a keen attention to historical detail. Overall a very good read."
5,Casca the Eternal Mercenary books,"This series, written largely by the former Nam Green Beret, Barry Sadler, are surprisingly good. They are more than the usual slash and fornicate stories; the historical detail behind them is well researched."
1,An insult to Sadler's memory,"I really wanted to like this book as I have read all Sadler's Casca books and enjoyed most of them. I never actually finished reading the book, it was so bad.The writer needs a lot more editorial control regarding pace and structure. The whole middle section of the book (where I gave up) has no action - Casca sits around, eats his meals, and that's it. In the first few chapters the author spends a lot of time describing the other people on the boat and I thought these guys would be with Casca throughout the story, but they get killed off by the pirates - what a waste of time.I am surprised that Dengelegi was invited back to do a second book."
2,The Return of the Eternal Mercenary,"I was extremely excited to find a new Casca novel after so many years. Like most Casca fans, I was saddened and disappointed to hear about the death of Barry Sadler. Mr. Sadler's Casca novels were always welcome reading. He had a wonderful ability to mix history, fiction, and plain old fashioned soldiering that produced many unforgettable stories. I was disappointed, however, with this new story. The author gets bogged down with inane diversions such as the endless baths, and feasting on lizards. And who ever heard of Casca getting fat!! In addition, there is none of the usual Casca language, or dialogue. The author has relegated Casca to a mere spectator for most of the story. I applaud the effort of trying to resurrect the undying soldier, but sincerely hope that the author will study more of Barry Sadler's style and use this to keep the original flavor of the series intact. I hope another story is in the offing, and will see if the old Casca flair is back."
1,Casca: The Defiant,"Unlike most casca books, casca seems to be a supporting character in this book. The brotherhood normally could only mean the brotherhood of the lamb....now a different one shows up....whenever the doc has anything to do with experiencing casca's past, usually they meet....and at the end the good doctor finishes by giving the impresion he will write it all down and forward a copy to his old co...dr (col) landries)...was his tie in here out of context or just a way to show the readers that you had read one or two of his books (sadler) and know some of his characters names, but not their motives or how they fit in the grand scheme of the book....please reread the series to get a better feel for casca, how he deals with those of his past, his ways of communicating those stories, and how casca lived....no just a byline headed to an end...but actually what casca does and experiences..."
2,"Oh, well.","I've read (and re-read many times) the entire Cascaseries. Mr. Dengali made a valiant effort to continue the series, butfailed to grasp the character. The book was verbose to the extreme, filled with grammatical errors and errors of usage. The editor is at fault for this failing. ""Taught"" instead of ""taut?"" Please.Perhaps had the editor been familiar with the storyline of the series, Casca would have drowned after the pirate episode. Which not only would have let us bypass several pages, but would have been true to the character.A hard read, a story drawn beyond a viable length, and an indistinct setting, combined to make this book less than I had hoped for.But Paul, don't give up! Re-read the originals, cut down on the flowery prose and take another crack at it! I'd love to see another one.I seem to rememeber a mention of Machiavelli..."
3,Haunting and imaginative,"A book I would normally not have picked up to read as a female, but inspired by a very good friend to give it a try. I was impressed by the power of the words which left me in pain, gasping for air, searching for strength, and tasting the ageless saltwater till the bitter end. Not having read any Barry Sadler books before, I found that this imaginative character will always have a lesson for us all; that life is difficult, never dull, and always rewarding, if you look in the right places.Thank you to the author for sharing his vision of a never ending life that continues to fight knowing that there is no end in sight."
4,Liberator,"I comend Dengelegi for taking on such a task. Casca is a tough man to capture. There were several times in the book that I felt something was missing. But he is very close. I will continue to read his books about Casca, I feel in another book or two he will fully capture the essince of Casca."
1,Casca The Liberator,"The author failed to catch the soul of Casca as developed by Barry Sadler. Get a Sadler series Casca, they're exellent, this one is not worth the money. It's hard to figure where in time and place the book occurs, I had to force myself to read it, and I couldn't remain focused."
5,Fine portable table,"This table is well made, quite comfortable and light weight. A great table for the price.Robert Turner, RMT"
1,I only received 4 brake pads,"I only received 4 brake pads, that would put them at $12.50 each. I'm on the phone with amazon now to sort out the mistake. I'll update this review if I get the correct product. I haven't installed them yet just in case I need to return so I don't have an opinion on their quality. They look like they do in the picture there are just 46 less of them than I expected/ordered."
4,A Very Japanese Cartoon,"I love this video. It has two Pochacco cartoons on it and two Keroppi cartoons. If you've ever wondered what Pochacco and Keroppi's voices sound like, here's your chance. As the previous reviewer mentioned, this video is very soothing. I often watch it to fall asleep at night and it NEVER fails. One funny thing about this video is all the silly mistakes in it. There's one scene where, in the space of two minutes, the same body of water is referred to as a lake, a pond, and a river. Also, there's a part where Pochacco is sitting on a swing, and the thickness of the branch keeps changing, as well as the number of swings! Pochacco's voice couldn't be cuter, though, and his laugh will crack you up. The humor is quite Japanese, as is one of the stories, in which Pokopon, a bear who plays drums on his stomach, has his belly button stolen by the Cloud People! I found this obscure, but overall the video is really VERY charming."
4,Visceral,"If you are used to her, buy it. If not. Do not. Her madness and pain is in every word and every tone. Visceral in every sense."
5,First effort a noble one...,"First time independent filmmakers Matt Brooks and Phil Thomas put forth a noble effort on Shadow Brook. The writing and directing pair make do with the very small budget they have and produce a very watchable, entertaining, spooky, and sometimes humorous tale of supernatural occurences and the trail of murder that preceded them. If anything is worth the view it would have to be the black and white flashback scenes that illustrate the bloody history of the serial killer known as, Robert Baker. I highly reccommend this film for the indy movie lover and casual movie fan alike."
3,I remember the whole theatre screaming...,"...during this movie's infamous 3-D dream sequence. What made the matter worse is that the theatre was unnecessarily freezing: they could have turned on the heat, but I guess they were going for that William Castle thing... You were supposed to slap on your glasses as the hero was putting on the mask. I recall skulls with melting eyeballs, druids rowing down the river Styx, murderous looking events in these dream sequences...I must've been 7 or 8 at the time so I was indelibly marked. What also made matters worse is that my olders brothers were laughing about me being scared spitless...nowadays since every kid of 7 or 8 has been treated to the likes of Freddy and Jason, it wouldn't even cause a shiver to youngsters. I believe, however, it would be still fun, to kids nonetheless."
2,Seemed cool when I was ten years old,"This film is fun if you like movies that are silly and cheaply made. I do. A man sees a wierd world of leaping fire, demons et. al. when he puts on the ceremonial mask as directed by his therapist. There is more to it, not much, but it gives you about 80 minutes of time away from the real world. I saw this first run with my mother, who made us leave the movie early. The ""terror"" wasn't creeping up her spine, a patron accosted her in the theater's balcony. Has nothing to do with this cinematic treasure, just a story I think of when I see this film."
4,The Mask,"The Mask is a good film from way back when and is also in 3D in some sections when it says 'put the mask on' (meaning put your glasses on'. I thought it was clever, scary and all around a good production. As far as the 3D goes, it works very well actually there are some moments in there that reflect it's goal and it just adds another element to the film. So all around, as in these movies go , keep an open mind, follow the instructions on viewing 3D, and just try to relax and enjoy yourself."
3,Glasses? I didn't get no stinking glasses!,"I don't know what's up with this release...the DVD I got says nothing about included 3D glasses, and indeed there are NONE. I went to the manufacturer's website, and the same basic DVD cover is displayed, except theirs says, ""3d glasses included"" right on the front (mine doesn't)...weird. I see another reviewer here claims their copy came with one pair...who knows? Video quality is a little hazy, but overall probably an improvement over VHS. Best 3D is achieved when viewed on a computer monitor."
1,Be careful,"I really liked my P-2000. However, in the last 2 weeks I have had to change my mind. I got the blue screen of death with the icon that said press reset. No luck. So, I tried to get it fixed and found out to put in a new drive and download the software it would cost $435.00. I looked around on the internet and ended up at Epson and was gob smacked. One should know that any of the ""photo viewers"" from Epson can not be reformated, defraged, have the software downloaded again or have the drive replaced. It takes a ""special drive"". My point is this company is selling a computer device that cost several hundred dollars and is is a THROW AWAY product. If you like to waste your money go ahead but if your want value for your dollar run, run like the wind."
3,don't buy this to save storage costs,"Reviews to save pictures on trips is on the wrong tract. Buy this device to display pictures. You can buy Compact Flash 32 GB for $80. You can buy Secure Digital High Capacity 32 GB for $35. The top reviewer bought this ""storage device"" to continue using his 512 MB compact Flash! For $80 he could have multiplied his storage by 64x and never needed this ""storage device"". I take all of my pictures in raw & jpeg with a Canon 5D full frame camera, 12.8 mpxl. Using a 32 GB CF, I get 1,400 pictures. I carry 2-32 GB CF cards for a total of 4,200 pictures on very long back pack trips. The total cost for these cards is $240. So - don't buy this ""storage device"" to save money - buy it so you can show pictures to friends w/o taking your laptop with you."
1,Extremely unreliable,I have had 2 of these LaCie drives and have lost data on BOTH of them. I can't warn you away from these drives strongly enough.
1,I cant get LaCie to tell me,"Where to send the drive for repair under warranty... I could not see any address or number to call in their site, nor in the warranty papers attached to the drive...And a return number is needed...My warranty espires soon, and there is a risk of losing it if I cant ship it on time..Can any one help me please?Thanksyuval@mivzak.com"
2,"Great Price, Lots of Storage, and High Failure Rate","I own 12 of the Lacie 500 gb firewire drives, purchased over the period of 18 months. (I needed firewire compatability and the large amount of storage.) During that time, I've had to return two for repair. Another recently failed, but since it was out of warranty, LaCie would not accept it for repair - even though I was willing to pay for the repair. I have lost data on 2 other drives and have to reformat those drives to get them to work again. I've asked LaCie to comment on the high failure rate, but they have not responded. Because of this, I will no longer purchase LaCie external drives. My latest purchase was a 400 gb drive from OWC (Other World Computing). They were recommended by a graphic design firm that uses Macs and stores a lot of data. The drives are both PC and Mac compatable. So far, I am very pleased with my OWC drives."
1,Just when you thought it was safe to buy Lacie!,"Think again. I would purchase this drive now, only if I were then sending to my worst enemy so that he could load 30 hours of select documentary footage and then have the drive die 3 months after purchase with no data recovery available from Lacie. This is 3'rd drive to die on me out of 4 drives in just the last 12 months. All three drives having complete power failure. THE COST SAVINGS IS DEFINATELY NOT WORTH THE COMPLETE UNRELIABILITY OF THIS DRIVE!"
1,WHAT A RIP-OFF!,$35 for a 28 minute video that is basically a cheesy slide show from some guy's collection of fantasy paintings downloaded from the net! His musical choices are the ultimate in boring 'corporate video' stock music! This is something ANY of us could make with even the most rudimentary slideshow programs. I can't believe this is being sold here!
2,Below Average Bouncer,"I bought this bouncer because it seemed like a good value at the time. I was disappointed to find out the fabric is very rough nylon and so I always have to line it with a blanket if the baby isn't wearing pants.The concept of the chair is good but it's bulky and no matter how I position the baby, he always ends up sliding down to the point where his whole body is only on the bottom half of the bouncer.Save your money and buy a bouncer with good reviews, I know I'll have to buy a different one and donate this one to goodwill - it wasn't worth the shipping fee to return it."
3,Adequate tool but inferior to old ones,"I use a grub hoe for heavy garden work and especially for trail building. The one I prefer to use is my father's, and it is at least 50 years old. It has a made in USA stamp but no other markings. Comparing that old tool with the Seymour is like comparing a 1986 Chevy to a 2010 BMW. The Seymour is made of thicker stock so it is considerably heavier. The steel is much too soft for digging, so it loses its edge immediately. The angle of the blade relative to the socket is too shallow, so it does not have very good cutting action.If you have no other grub hoe, this one will do the job. It won't make you a fan of grub hoes, however, as it is rather clunky and crude. Instead, keep your eyes open at junk shops and garage sales for an old-timey made in USA tool (you can always buy the replacement handle for it)."
4,Dandy gardening tool,"I got this grub hoe to replace an azadon I broke rasslin' with a root. This grub hoe is much smaller than the broken tool, but still quite useful and seemingly well-made. I will not be subjecting it to unnecessary stress, however."
4,Seymour 2E-G60 Grub Hoe Head,"It works as expected. The foundry work is elementary and very crude. Not a prideful tool. You are not paying for workmanship, just function."
2,Authentic Turkish Gypsy sound ..,"It's impossible for Tekbilek to do bad music, but unfortunately the vocalist on this recording is a little too authentic for western ears. All the pieces which are strictly instrumental are good. Otherwise, save your money for one of his other recordings."
4,Hearing the old tunes with new ears,"If you're involved in belly dancing -- whether as a performer or just an appreciative audience -- many of these tunes will be familiar to the point of banality: they're the old staples, like ""Rompi Rompi,"" that dancers have been undulating to for the past half-century. But on this album they're transformed and refreshed by an outstanding group of musicians from various Middle Eastern countries (mostly Turkish and Armenian). The musicians' skill, energy, and heartfelt appreciation of the music result in an album that's listenable and danceable all the way through.I'm a belly dance student, and had heard selections from this album numerous times in class and at performances before I finally purchased it. I put it on the CD player and sat down to read ... but after the first few tracks I quit reading, and by the last three I was improvising dances all over my living room. It really IS that good."
5,Exquisite,"I'm a professor of middle eastern history in New York. whomever has ever readanything about Alexander the Great, The Crusades or even Marco Polo, these beautifultunes will transport if not your body, your spirit back in time.Just relax, close your eyes and let go.... You'll find yourself meandering through the street markets,smell of spices, wet dirt and flowers, drowned in a sea of vendors, merchants andfellow strollers in the heart of this blessed land.... so, as I said before,lose your eyes and let go...enjoy!!"
3,Disappointing,"Surprise ending but I didn't care for it. Left unanswered questions regarding forest noises, where did they get their clothes and supplies etc. Good acting though."
1,one star. barely.,"Ethereal journey into lame nudity and strange cinematography. Not worth the money. The models look best on the DVD packaging, once you open it and hit play it all goes downhill from there."
3,Good but not the best...,"This album is good enough but definitely not the best NEKROMANTIX CD. I'd recommend starting off with ""Curse of the Coffin"" or ""Brought Back to Life"". The flaws in this album lie with it's exceptionally slower tempos and drum machine-sounding drums. Don't get me wrong, there are some great tracks on here (""Demons are a Girl's...."", ""Sea of Red"", and ""Alive"", among others), but it's definitely not the epitome of NEKROMANTIX. Like I said, if you're not familiar with them, start somewhere else!"
4,Fun Fun Fun!,"My title pretty much sums it up. Who hasn't dreamed of saying, "" Lieutenant, set a course for the xi entrades system..........MAximum Warp. You can do this in this game- if you have voice activated command system. Its pretty fun to fight cardassians, and damage is really realistic. You can even saw off warp nacelles with phaser fire! Giving orders is fun, but steering the ship yourself is even moreso. If you so much as think of ramming starbase 12( tons of fun) your first officer seizes command from you. The kessok, a new race are a little over powered, but a sovereign can take care of one with good tactics. this brings me to ships. in single player you get galaxy and sovereign. in skirmish, you get those two, ambassador class, akira class, nebula class,a shuttle craft(yes you heard me right) vorcha, bird of prey, warbird, kessok light, kessok heavy, and a ferengi marauder. so if your going to buy one game this summer, make this it!"
4,Pretty Good actually...,"I enjoy the game. There are some frustrating points, but overall, it is good. Make sure that you have a fast computer, otherwise the game might freeze on you, unless you have it set on low detail. And when it says ""letest technology voice-automated system"" it is true, but they don't tell you you need to buy an additional... program to get this to work. The lip syncing is BAD...and the characters have no facial emotion whatsoever, but the gameplay is really good, and is JUST like a movie. Once you get the basics down, the game gets good."
4,Make it so....,"I played the demo for the past few days and it was very enjoyable. This is the only game of the franchise where you can act like a true Captain and sit back barking orders to your crew. The interface looks good and functions very well. The graphics are crisp and the voices are very well done. I'll have to reserve final judgment until I get the full version (it better not have a lot of bugs!).After your Captain is killed you (the first officer) is promoted to Captain. It's your job to discover why your beloved captain was killed and solve mysteries along the way. There are plenty of battles included to keep your chief engineer busy, you tactical officer stressed and your new first officer wondering if its not to late for her to transfer off your ship.The game plays out like a good episode from The Next Generation series.Note, I'm giving the DEMO 4 Stars."
2,Sad sad sad,"This game puts you in the captains chair only to be the puppet of your officers. New meaning to the term, on rails. I give this game 2 stars only because combat did raise my blood pressure.Download the demo, avoid the game."
1,Dumb,"I own a couple of Star Trek themed games from the Starfleet command line and this game doesn't even come close. The bad lip synching is probably the most entertaining aspect of this game. The main problem is that the game is very linear: you have to end up doing what the script tells you. There is no ""character development"" (rank advancement, choosing your crew/ship) and the crew that you do get is very annoying. As ""captain"" you are pretty much just a figurehead (my dog could probably run this game) as the other characters run the show. The graphics themselves aren't bad -- if you don't mind looking at people that resemble bobble-heads. Overall there is no grit and throw down action that you would get from the Starfleet command games: which admittedly, is very much in character with the actual ST:TNG (i.e. very watered down, bland... and dumb)."
2,"Might be good, but beware!","Somthing they do not -ever- state in the manual or the box (read both, cover - to - cover, is that you MUST have Microsoft Game Voice in order to use this. Which requires an ADDITIONAL [$$] purchase. If you have it to spare, go ahead for the thrill of commanding a starship with your voice. Otherwise, I most heartily reccomend Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War."
1,Way to many bugs. . .,"I was exited about the game, but could not get it to run long enough to enjoy it.Activision was unwilling to assist in troubleshooting, but Best Buy was nice enough to take the bug ridden game back.To bad because it started out good till it kept crashing."
2,"Ok, but lacking","This is a not the type of command game i would expect from activison. Although i am a hardcore treky i dont like it. The lip movement is of and i wish you could assum a more room the ship type game with command. An Elite Force/Command game would be good in my opinion. You should also be able to go to systems you want to. Hey, overall its worth the buy, but its not the best"
2,Star Trek Bridge Commander.,I've been playing Star Trek Bridge Commander for a while now after I purchased the game just a few years ago. The computer graphics are great if you like to take the Captain's Chair. This game requires some stragety and it's often difficult to play. I have to play this game a number of times before I can get through the next level. But if you are a extremely better gamer and love Star Trek this game is for you. If not don't buy this game if you are not satisified.
1,DO NOT waste your money,"Although I am trekkie and purchased this game with high hopes, I was immensely disappointed. The only positive thing I can say about the game is that most of the graphics are impressive. (One notable exception: when characters' lips move when they are talking, it looks ridiculous and unrealistic.) Every other aspect of the game is horrendous. Gameplay is very slow, and you spend a lot of time just watching events unfold, in sickeningly slow speed, on the screen. The game even manages to make battles boring--you just instruct your tactician, with a series of mouse clicks, to attack, and he fires at the enemy ship for a good five minutes until it blows up. This relegates you to the role of observer rather than participant, which makes for a boring experience. Also, you do not have the ability to save during a mission, so if you make a mistake and fail a mission, you are doomed to repeat the entire boring experience. I strongly recommend against this game."
3,Fun But Limited,"Although better than most Star Trek games, this one still has some problems. Chief amoung these are the linear nature (there is only one right way to complete missions), the lack of flexibility (I can only remember being asked to make 3 decisions though the whole game), no way of skipping the (interminable) dialogue and not being able save other than between missions.On the plus side, the graphics (especially the lighting effects) are beautiful, the storyline is good and you do get the feeling of being in a large ship.Just to address a couple of points raised by other reviewers;1. I had no problem with the speed of the game at all. There were fairly frequent crashes though.2. I was able to complete all the missions with the ships provided. there is some strategy needed!Anyway, now looking forward to the expansion pack."
4,First class simulator,"While not perfect it is a good simulator with lots of things to do in battle. Admittedly, sometimes I feel there is too many things to play with in the game, and in the midst of battle there is so much to think about. Makes one wonder how Kirk or Picard did it.Anyway if you like Trek this is one game you should get."
4,Great game for all ST:TNG fans,"Star Trek Bridge Commander is a great game and its unique ""on the bridge"" feeling makes it a great game for all trekers, but the fun dosen't last too long. It's a great game to come back to after not playing it for 5 months but that does not mean that I regret buying it. Graphically Bridge Commander is great, the ships practically flew out of the show and the phasers ant torpedoes look fantastic, however ""For every good, there is evil"" (see Star Trek: Nemesis). The lip syncing is the worst in history. There mouths move in a set pattern no matter what there saying making it look like a horribly badly dubbed Godzilla movie, but if you dont care about lip syncing, then GET THIS GAME!"
1,Too Bad,"It is a great Idea and a good try. However, the problem is Activision tried to do it and screwed it all up. Yea it starts out ok. The Demo seems good. But once you try and get into the game, you will find that you will get nowhere, unless you can play for 3-5 hours strait. You are unable to save your game as you go along. The only saving is done when you complete a mission, and most take hours to go through. Now it's not because they are hard just lost of useless stuff to wait through. They try to bridge the Movie-Action game scenario, but end up making mud. I suggest you wait for it to hit the discount bin for $5.00 in about a month."
2,very disappointing,"I had very high hopes for this game, as someone who enjoys the strategy and captain-level decisions, and the Star Trek universe. And at first blush this game got it exactly right - you are the captain, and you decide the strategy and then delegate (""science officer, send a probe. Navigator, lay in a course for Starbase 12. Engineer, divert max power to shields"" - that sort of thing). And the graphics are very nice, and the story is interesting.BUT, each scenario I played (and I did about the first, oh, 6) has a VERY narrow and constrained success tree - you have to do a precise sequence of actions, in a precise order, to win. I felt like a puppet. There was no room to explore various options, no multiple paths to success - you do A, then B, then C, typically as quickly as possible, and any deviation results in failure :-(. I got bored of the game very quickly."
2,Powerful and wonderful strategic space simulator: S.T.B.C.,""" Star Trek Bridge Commander ""by Activision, is the most important, powerful and wonderful strategic space simulator of history (2003)."
3,"Good History, weak characters","When I first came upon this book, I was excited to read it, I have read several other books by this author, each of them interesting and hard to put down. ""You Are My Sunshine"" was written in an interesting time, Ms. Saxton does a good job of detailing what life was like during the war, especially for women. Her description of working the ballons and life during war time seems very authentic. However, her characters are boring, and have no real depth, I found it hard to really like any of them. She never really gets behind what makes them tick. The plot was very weak, and somewhat typical.If you are interested in World War II fiction, I would recommend you read ""This Royal Breed"", by Judith Saxton, this book was much better written, with great characters, suspense, and good historical content."
4,Great Story! A must read for any Historical Romance Fan!!,"""You Are My Sunshine"" tell of the story of four young Birtish women who served in the WAAF working with the air ballons. Ms. Saxton gives the reader a real feeling of what the men and women face during one of England darkest hours. The Anglo slang also give the book a good feel. Overall, ""You Are My Sunshine"" is a great Historical novel!"
4,I attended this actual show!,"I was actually at this Dave Mason concert which was recorded live at the Sunrise Musical Theatre in Sunrise, Florida (Fort Lauderdale). I have read the other reviews here at this site and many complain that the show was short. There is a reason Dave Mason did not play for very long. It is because he was not the headliner for the event. Dave Mason was the opening act. The headliner was Deep Purple. They also recorded their show and you can buy their DVD...which they called Perihelion. The audience was aware that the shows were being taped so the audience was extra boisterous. On a side note...the Sunrise Musical Theatre no longer hosts concerts. It was bought out a few years ago and is now a Church."
5,An Incredible Live Show!,"I actually had the pleasure of seeing this tour live in Atlanta. The DVD is one of the few live performances that you'll see that is just as good as being there at the show. Dave is playing at his prime and Richard Campbell on Bass is simply incredible. I own over 200 concert DVDs and this one is in my top 5. I especially like the stretch of songs beginning with 40,000 Headmen through All Along the Watchtower. ""Look at You Look at Me"" is breathtaking with the changes in rhythm and the guitar solos. All in all a must have for any classic rock fan. Highly Recommended. Great recording in both DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1."
3,was the show that short?,"Dave Mason was the first act I ever saw live in 1974. He can still play with the best of them. What he's lost in hair, he's picked up in girth, but haven't we all? My only complaint is the length of this DVD. Unless something's changed, Dave probably played a longer set than this. His playing is excellent, and his band, while not as tight as the group on his double live album of the mid-70's, is more than adequate. Live at Perkins Palace is probably the more interesting of his 2 recent releases, it being recorded in the 80's in a purely acoustic setting. Still, I bought both, and I'd urge you to do the same."
3,let down,"Dave Mason's music is of course great. But you would think that after all these years he would want to present it more professionaly. As he say's ""rock-n-roll is an attitude not an age"". I am older now and my entertainment criteria has changed. Maybe I'm spoiled by Elton John's outstanding DVD or Peter Gabriel's interesting show's. Dave Mason is a legend and will alway's remain so but he could have done better."
2,Just Ok,"Non inspired - He seemed to be out of gas, or just hung over from the previous gig. Dave Mason is one of my all time favorite guitaists and song writers, so I am still looking for a DVD with him in his prime."
4,Dave Mason goes electric,"The other DVD I have of Dave Mason is the acoustic one where he plays mostly with just one other guitar player. This DVD shows Dave off with a band. Between the two DVD's you have Dave, with hair, on acoustic guitar and then Dave, like you would see him now, with a complete band. If you like Dave, you will love the DVD."
2,buy the cd instead,"The music is wonderful but the direction is awful. On this 92 minute DVD more time is spent looking up Jarrett's nostrils that at the keyboard.An improv concert is not significant because of the particular sequence of Jarrett's facial contortions. It's the music, man. The music! So why all the face shots?Now I'm familiar with Jarret's antics, and the verbailizations hardly interfere with my appreciation of the music, but I won't buy another Jarrett solo DVD without some assurance that I'll actually get to watch him play the piano.(Actually there are a couple nice shots, but I wouldn't buy this one again)."
4,Chicken Soup for the Surviving Soul,"Very good book! Having been diagnosed with Cervical cancer, I found it encouraging to know that there are many cancer survivors out there."
4,Uplifting,"Cancer patients can find inspiration from short stories filled with hope and courage, written by survivors. Great for family members too."
2,Couldn't finish it.,I got this book out of the library. I just couldn't finish it. It just made me feel scared. I esp couldn't handle the stories about the children who had cancer. I have a 6 month old granddaughter and she is healthy and I just couldn't read about the children who had c. So I skimmed over it and going to return it to the library tomorrow.
3,Helpful Book?,"Purchased for my friend with leukemia. I thought it would help but, made her very upset and sad. Never finished it and have lost a dear friend. Perhaps others will be helped by this book."
5,A Timely Help,"Chicken Soup for the Cancer Surviving Soul is an inspiring collection of true stories from people with tough cancer diagnoses.I was given it as a gift when I was struggling with cancer. The stories were a huge encouragement and helped me find a path to survival.As a twelve year cancer survivor now, I have and continue to give a copy to anyone I know who is finding themself in a struggle with cancer."
1,A Little Disappointed,"I like the book but it's not in as good of condition as I'd like it to be , but it's ok"
3,Jungle Soap,"For a good two-thirds of ""Elephant Walk"" the film is bogged down by uninteresting melodramatics, namely a love triangle involving the film's principal actors(Elizabeth Taylor, Peter Finch, Dana Andrews). The last third of the film is redeemed by a compelling cholera epidemic and a well staged elephant stampede in the film's setting, a tea plantation in Ceylon. The main actors acquit themselves well despite the fact that they are participating in an opulently staged soap opera. Other pluses here are the stunning interior designs and gorgeous Edith Head creations. Of course, young Liz is stunning to look at. That said, if you want to check out a better plantation melodrama ""The Naked Jungle"" with Charlton Heston and Eleanor Parker would be well worth your while."
4,Journey back in time,"I saw this movie back when it first came out back then. It's a little quaint by today's standards. However, Elephant Walk, The Naked Jungle, Foxes of Harrow, Blood on the Moon, etc., etc. where post-WWII films made back in the days of innocense and great filming and action. The days of big bands and great films are gone, and pretty soon I will follow. Thanks. George W. Barclay Jr."
4,Elephant Walk,I enjoy this movie very much. The quality of the picture and sound was also very good.
3,Elephant Walk,"I am not crazy enough to pay $69.99 for this movie. Sorry but no movie is worth this much money. I have bought hundreds of movies from Best Buy, Walmart and Amazon. I will not waste my money."
3,Elephant Walk,It's hard anymore to find good decent movies and this is a winner on all accounts.Elizabeth Taylor is beautiful in this movie.A young girl in London meets the man of her dreams and he takes her back to live with him in India.Her young prince charming and her beautiful Camala turns into nightmare when she discoverers that her dead father in law is dictating her life from beyond the grave.One of her husbands business partners tries to take her away from her husband just as Cholera forces them into Quarantine.This really is a good movie for anyone who likes old movies with suspense and romance.I enjoyed it when I saw it and went to amazon to purchase it so it would be in our family collection.
3,Good movie,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and loved it, then!It just didn't do for me now what it did back then. Still, I'm glad I bought it. It's nice to watch them good ol' classics when you don't have cable:) Besides, they don't make them like they use to!"
3,Elizabeth at her most beautiful,"OK, it's not a great movie. But if you're fan of Ms. Taylor, your collection needs this movie. She's never look lovelier. The sets, costumes, music and sets are marvelous. I want that house! The story is a little bit of a rehash of ""Rebecca."""
2,Forgery????,"The copy I received has the look of a bootleg CD...The disk does not even play on my CD player! I was however able to read it on my DVD player.The artwork seems to have been printed on an inkjet printer. The last straw is that there are no program notes.What can I say, I am shocked!Rare repertory, very well interpreted by McAslan and Blakely, it's an INSULT that the medium is not up to par."
5,Exemplary treatment of a difficult subject,"This is by far the easiest-to-read and -understand book I have read on PowerBuilder. It is very well edited also, with no grammatical or spelling errors that I could discern. This is a far better book on PowerBuilder than I have read by any other author. Bravo!"
5,"Steiner quality binos, at fraction of the price.",These binoculars rival higher priced models from Leupold and Steiner. Clear crisp optics with features outdoorsmen need...Highly recommended.
3,works but too expensive.,"These are the same that come with your new E2 head set, but boy are they expensive. you get 5 pairs, (not 10 as the wording might mislead on to think), and they are all the same ones that come with a new unit. nothing exciting. but it does work. cancels out noise, and makes your music sound great. What you see is what you get."
2,Overpriced,"These work well with the iPod, but they're ridiculously overpriced. You should order them directly from Shure."
5,Everyone should have a copy,"Everyone should have a copy of this book in their library. It is easy to read and is a great reference book for any civics minded person, student or teacher."
5,had to buy more,Originally purchased as gift for husband as accompaniment to B&N hardcover Constitution & Bill of Rights. He thought it was such a great gift that he had me buy another set to give to his dad...and I bought another one for my grandfather. They all loved it.
3,Useful for kids and internet newbies,"I would recommend this book to two types of folks:1) If you have kids in junior high or high school. This would be an excellent resource for them in their civics classes in regards to providing an excellent, though shallow, perspective on the Constitution.2) If you haven't yet required the skills to search the Internet for specific topics or don't possess readibly available access to the Internet.Ms. Monk does an excellent job with the perspective she provides. My quibble is how thin this volume is, quite frankly I was hoping for more perspective. I do admit I occasionally use it, thus three stars, but I find myself mostly using the Internet or my other books on the Constitution as reference sources rather than Ms. Monk's publication."
2,Dishonest,"The authors understanding of the Second Amendment is not sincere to historical fact. The national guard (a government force) was formed by an act of congress in 1913. Well over a century after the bill of rights and Second Amendment were ratified in 1779.The ""militia"" as clearly stated within the amendment is ""the people"". The entire premise of the bill of rights was to protect civilian authority by having the means to protest and wage war if necessary having just won a revolution! By what logic does this author gain the view of a government force needing a ""right"" to bear arms? Which amounts to nothing less than an intellectually dishonest effort to read the Second Amendment out of existence. Something that the enemies of the first amendment might apply one day.I would suggest reading ""The Bill of Rights"" by Akhil Reed Amar"" for an accurate understanding of this ""doomsday provision"".""The framers recognized that self-government required bullets as well as ballots""- A.R. Amar"
3,"Starts out great, then fizzles","The first 4 or 5 songs are wonderful- upbeat with clever lyrics. Many of these songs remind me a bit of Elvis Costello. My kids especially cannot get enough of ""My Feet"" and ""My Green Kite"".Near the end of the CD, though, the songs are slower and not nearly as catchy as the ones in the beginning.I appreciate Peter's ability to mix up tempco and style, but some just didn't hit the mark."
4,Narcissism Unveiled,"If you want to learn more about pathological narcissism, borderline conditions and other low-organization personalities - this book is for you. Essentially a textbook, it is a surprisingly interesting read (case studies intersdpersed). Some professional jargon and the book's bias in favour of psychodynamic theories may make best as a second read about narcissism. Sam Vaknin, author of 'Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited'."
2,"brand new and cheap, but doesn't last","came brand new in plastic (shipping was kind of slow), fits perfectly in phone, looks ok but charge only lasts a day at best AND the label on battery is not the one shown- does not say lenmar anywhere on it. i guess it might be worth the 3.99"
4,Seymour Mfg. DG-AEH Eye Hoe Handle,Happy with purchase. A little rough on the final finish. Will want to sand these a little or wear gloves. In all fairness these are as good or better than most of the wood replacement handles I see in the stores.
5,Hoe Handle,Perfect handle I probably couldn't have picked a better one myself I was truly surprised the first page I looked on the handle was right there.
3,Be forewarned,"Be forewarned! The Ninth Symphony here has poor sound quality due to the noisy surfaces it must have been drawn from. The performance, by the Berlin Philharmonic in Queen's Hall, London one May 1937 may have been electric, but listening to this is a chore.The September 1953 Vienna Philharmonic ""EROICA"" and February 1944 Berlin Philharmonic 5th Symphony are much better in sound quality. Here Furtwangler's special magic shines through, and these are a much finer listening experience than the 1937 Ninth.If you decide to purchase, ask yourself if you want these particular recordings of Furtwangler's Beethoven 3 and 5. I'd recommend those wanting a Furtwangler Beethoven 9 to get the August, 1954 Philharmonia live performance at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, on a Tahra CD. This has much better sound than the Ninth in this compilation."
5,Love,"I bought this pair of earrings for the game a week before, it was a fast delivery I got them a say before the game! I really like the details in it."
3,Love the NINERS!!!,"I purchased these earrings because I love the San Francisco 49ers!!! The earrings are ok, the silver on the right earring is darker than the silver on the left earring. Otherwise, I like them. I plan on purchasing a few more unique 49er items for my collection ;-)"
2,Viet Nam Commemorative Sword,"Nice keepsake.Steel was nice,but sheath is made of plastic.Not authentic for Viet Nam era.Iwo Jima was not in Viet Nam,(main design on the sword)"
5,Killer heat and heart from Brazil,"Lins--a human music box and worthy successor to Jobim and Nasimento--leads a hot sextette of Rio musicians thru his tunes in this live concert. It's awesome: Lins laughs, aches, howls, soars--and you will too. Quite simply, the best Brazilian jazz in years. The craft and pop finish on the arrangements disguises the solid musicianship required to pull this off, live. To hear Lins do Aparecida--cut 8--is as close as you'll ever get to orgasm on a cd. The good news: the miking and sound by the Pittsburg musicians who staged the 1997 concert is first class. The better news: you will soon be singing Portugese in your car and dreaming of Rio. A knock out. Order it."
3,TOO LOUD,the power difference was noticeable but so was the noise increase. Went back to stock filter system. Just to noisy for the gain
3,Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,"Maybe it was just the seller I chose through Amazon but the Game came without its original case. It was packaged inside a regular clear CD case. The game was in good condition but I was expecting a case. Well it was a great deal anyway and I like the game but next time I will know better what ""Very Good Condition"" really means. Just curious though, I wonder what kind of condition a game has to be in to come in an original case?"
3,ok,i bought it used... i didnt expect a new cd... but there was scratch on the cd... the game didnt start many times.. i gave up playing it
5,i love it ! no regrets !!!,"it just came in today , i was kinda worried about it not working due to the other reviews on here, but mine works just fine !!! and im very much pleased :D !!! thanks !"
1,Sucks,"The disk had scratch after scratch. It was just torn up, and also had an internal warp where it had been sitting out in the sun."
3,Disappointed,"I got this as a Christmas gift and was very excited about playing it. It took a while to get used to the controls but soon I was off and running, riding bikes, driving cars, and swimming around. However, stealing cars and running over people got old pretty quick. There is nothing much to do if you don't follow the linear storyline EXACTLY. It's like a storybook were you have to complete each chapter before anything happens. I just wanted to cruise around in this Grand Theft Auto world and do my own thang, but no, you can't rob stores, you can't pick anything up, you can't break windows or open random doors, unless these things are part of the single storyline. You have to follow the plot or nothing happens. Uhg. These people need to buy a clue from Dragon Age.Oh well, it was fun driving around and I did follow the basic storyline for a while. It may grow on me over time."
5,BEST OF THE BEST,"THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED, IN THIS GAME YOU CAN DO ANY THING YOU CAN'T DO IN REAL LIFE"
1,Does NOt Work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"really wish there was a zero star because it did not work for me it said ""unble to read disc"" ugh!!!! ...its karma because this is a bad game hahahaha. ...dont buy from this seller though."
5,Excelent game.,The game is very entertaining. The package arrived on time and in perfect condition. I will definitely shop again with Amazon and with this merchant.
5,SUPERB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just passed this game last weekend. THe only disappointment I have is that when I stopped playing it after passing the last mission ""END OF THE LINE"" and went to bed, the next day when I uploaded it to play all the other extra-curricular missions I haven't done yet, it wouldn't upload and I had to start from the beginning but oh well. At least if I play it again and I do have the game guide for it, I have a big overview what to do. But over all this was a good game."
3,It did not come complete.Grand Theft AutoSan Andreas,This game did not come with the booklet or the Map. I was to understand that it was to have been complete. It was not. I will rethink before I buy from here again.
1,A Kids Review 3,I wrote 5 star reviews for GTA 3 and vice cityThis game (from the start) Was INSTANTLY awful.1.The language is awful because in the first mission these guys in a gang (i think)Well they cuss at you (the f bomb about 3 times in 1 mission) Then worse then that I have only played this like 2 times. I also messed up I had this on PC. But it all the same nothing. i hope GTA games like this would be better because GTA 3 and Vice city were just perfect.I might buy this on PS2 but not very soon also this game really means MATURE because the themes are awful like there is a hot coffee mini-game on PC thank gosh they removed it even though I didn't have it.Age Group: I think 17 and up would be good. I am very surprised because i would put ages 10 11 or 12 and up for GTA 3 and Vice City so beware this game is not for kids.
1,"sucks, sucks sucks",one of the worst gta games ever made!I mean come on grown men riding around on bicycles?
1,BIG waste of money.,"This was horrible. I could not play the game for more than five minutes without it freezing or getting a black screen telling me there was an error with the disk. On a good day I could only fly, if I got into a car, automatic freeze. I was not happy."
2,Not so great,"I love the watch and my boyfriend loves the watch. I had heard good things about Invicta and always thought they were a good company. But had read some negative comments on amazon. I took a risk that I wish I hadn't. The pin that holds the band to the face kept coming out and one day it came out while he was walkin which caused the watch to fall off, which broke the second hand and another in the face. Now I have to deal with a warranty and Invicta to see how their customer service is. I'll have to get back to ya on that one. But would rather have my money back. Kinda pisses me off."
4,Looks better in real than photos,"I had this watch for a while. I think photos don't look so good as the watch in real. It's also bigger than it looks. Solid, stainless steel, not heavy. The embossed numbers in the dial look strong.Some friends found it very nice. Would like to see it with saphire crystal for a complete 5 star ranking. Price is great, very cheap for what you get."
5,Perfect mess-free fun!,"Let this be a generic review for all of the Aquadoodle toys. What a brilliant concept - writing with water on the designated mats, and if you wait a little bit, your canvas is clean again! It took my daughter a little while to understand the way the Aquadoodle works, but now she really looks forward to coming back to her mat after she's drawn on it, and have her scribbles disappear.Simple to use. Just add water to included pen and stamper set. Additional pens and stampers can be bought separately. Just doodle away, that's it. Folds up nicely. Pen and stamp set clip onto the mat. We hang our mat from a hanger for easy storage.This makes a nice birthday gift for any child."
5,Great product and seller service,This is a great product. Easy to assemble and use and great USA made quality. Arrived without the tranny drain pan. One call to National Tool Warehouse and it arrived the same day.
1,if you want what you didnt buy this is the place to go!!,"i paid for these 4 1/2 foot BLACK oars and after almost a month of waiting i finally got them...IN YELLOW, and customer service..ha good luck..i emailed them the problem and got nothing back..if you want something you didnt buy this is the place to go!!"
1,Leaks Like A Sieve At the Base,Rowenta DX8900 Professional Iron with No Auto Shut-OffWe have owned this Rowenta DX8900 for three years. I just started ironing in retirement and found my wife had stopped using it 6 months after we bought it. The water reservoir leaks badly through the base of the iron. She used a 50/50 mix of tap water and distilled as it instructs but it still developed a leak. Save your money and frustration...avoid this iron.
1,Do Not Purchase,"When you read the reviews that say this iron leaks water, believe them. Honestly! the thing leaks water every time I turn it on. And despite what the Rowenta website says about leakage, water is NOT coming from the soleplate... it leaks from every other conceivable place. Never again will I purchase a Rowenta product."
1,great for the first few months,"I thought I was upgrading from my late 80s hand-me-down Black & Decker iron. Wrong.This unit was very nice when I first started using it - steamed nicer than my old B&D.; Did everything I'd want an iron to do.Then I noticed it would burn a lot of fabrics even if I had it on a low setting. This would cause ""gunk"" to build up on the soleplate - leading me to spend around $15 on the Rowenta cleaning kit... which kind of works.And then the leaking started. I would fill the iron with water and start ironing a few minutes later - and find a puddle on the ironing board where the iron had been sitting... leaving barely any water left in the iron for steam.I don't know why everyone gives Rowentas such high reviews - I am not impressed. I tried a friend's Rowenta after this one started leaking and his gave me the same results after a couple months - burning fabrics and leaking all over the place.I'll stick with my late 80s B&D;, thank you very much."
1,Do not buy this iron!,"Iron leaks badly from the heelplate after one use. Rowenta's phone line was also disappointing, they apparently know they are selling junk and are unapologetic. All they will say is ""send it back at your expense and we'll take care of it in 30 days."" After reading Nancy Long's comment here (her replacement iron leaked as badly as the first one) I am hesitant to go through the hassle and expense of shipping this piece of junk back to the service center."
2,it's okay,"this drive is okay. I have made many coasters with it. You need to make sure you purchase the disks that they say that they support - I was told by their tech support this - we suggest you use tdk, ridata, imation, verbatims, sony, philips, ritek. Also was told this - we do not recommend our customers use memorex, maxell, any generic brands or store named brands e.g. officemax or staples.I found a firmware upgrade that seems to make it work at 8x with the Verbatims. It still fails with the Officemax and Memorex discs that I have.I have not burned any dual layers discs so I don't know about them."
5,Lite On Is Right On,"The best burner out there. Can handle any sort of disc with aplomb and no coasters. Lite On is so much better than other better known brands, but they're getting more famous by the moment."
5,Robot City book 1 & 2,What can I say 4 of the best stories I have ever read I am a long time asomov fan and thought after his death nothing would be as good but I have been proved wrong these stories could have come right out of asimovs own pen GREAT FABBY FANTASTIC if you havn't read them then I sugest you do you won't be dissapointed...
3,Could be better.,"This video is more about the climbers and less about the climb itself. The main reason this video is popular is due to the tragedy of all Rob Hall and Scott Fishers teams being caught in a storm and eventually dying during the filming, and if your buying this video for that reason only, dont, there isnt that much information on it. If you want to learn more about it read ""INTO THIN AIR"". Also if you want real everest info check out ""DEATH ZONE"" by nova its awsome."
5,Impressive,"Having seen the IMAX film several times, I did not believe that a small screen format could be all that good. I was wrong.Sure, the DVD lacks the stunning visual impact of the giant IMAX screen. But the quality of the video is much better than average. After viewing this DVD (on a computer monitor) my other DVDs seem to be flat and fuzzy.The story is riviting, the scenery stunning. Regardless of whether you have or haven't seen the IMAX version, this DVD is excellent on it's own. Very well done!"
4,Realistic climbing and visuals,"From a survivor that seriously affected his life, this video has fantastic visual appeal and emotional dialogue that gives you the realistic side of climbing Everest."
4,Not enough shoots on the mountains...,"Beautiful cinematography. However I felt they elaborated too much on the stories and off-mountain scenes, that the actual ""climb"" part too short. I would like to see more of their technical skills of mastering the highest mountain of the world."
3,OK-Spoiled by Reenactments & Blah Summit Shots,"The IMAX photography was breathtaking. However, some of the shots were reenactments. The summit shots were a disappointment. They looked as if they were taken with a 35mm camera, rather than IMAX."
4,'Everest' climbs to new levels of film making.,"""Everest"" has a great score, great narration by Academy Award winner Liam Neeson, and is an over all great concept. It is just unfortunate that anyone reading this will probably be seeing it on a television for the first time. ""Everest was made for the IMAX and has to be seen there to fully appreciate this level of film making. It is an eye-opening, enriching look at this great mountain, finally captured in its true essence for the first time for those who can only dream of climbing it."
1,"Big Mountain, Big Format, Small Film","Imax is a stunning film format, and climbing Everest is an awe-inspiring subject - so how come this film leaves you so cold and conveys so little of the human struggle. The script has all the depth of an exercise bike commercial, and while the climbers rise to 28000ft their insights never rise above the ""I love to climb, thats why I do it"" level. The huge irony was that the film was made the year of the biggest tradgedy in the mountains history and you still ended up thinking that you could easily get up to the top on a nice sunday afternoon stroll and be down for supper."
3,Could be better.,"This video is more about the climbers and less about the climb itself. The main reason this video is popular is due to the tragedy of all Rob Hall and Gary Fishers teams being caught in a storm and eventually dying during the filming, and if your buying this video for that reason only, dont, there isnt that much information on it. If you want to learn more about it read ""INTO THIN AIR"". Also if you want real everest info check out ""DEATH ZONE"" by nova its awsome."
2,Well presented but nothing great!,Forget about owning this DVD. It is not something you will love watching the second time as I didn't find the video or audio so great to enjoy it. It's just a plain simple regular type of documentary that happened to be a true story. I recommend it for viewing it once!
2,The Book is Better,"I ordered this DVD thinking that it would overpower me, and make me feel as if I was there. The movie was much too short, and lacked character. I found myself getting bored quickly, and this was coming from someone who read ""Into Thin Air,"" in a matter of days. I would advise everyone not to get this DVD, it is very disappointing. The tragedy on the mountain was covered very poorly, and the dialog was rather dull."
3,this is a documentary with exceptional beauty,Nature is seen in this documentary at its best and its worst. This will almost take you there.A true and tragic story.
3,Just Ok,"I thought that ""Everest"" was an OK documentry on climbing MT. Everest. Because it didn't tell about how you had to co up to the different camps many times before going to the summit as documented in a NOVA special I saw."
5,A testimony to human endurance,"Having seen this film in it's IMAX format was almost a spiritual experience. My recommendation for first time viewers wuold be to read either Into Thin Air, or The Climb then veiw the film to truly apppreciate the enormity of such a task as climbing the tallest mountain on Earth. It is truly a testimony to human endurance.earth"
2,Bafflingly dull -- how was this possible?,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" and ""The Climb"" and a dozen or more online articles, I remember having watched this film -- Brashears comes across as nothing short of a hero in ""Into Thin Air"" -- how, then, is it possible that this film is so dull? The score is intrusive, nearly comically so -- is there a plot?I don't understand how this film could be as... dull as it is. Was it bad editing? I just don't comprehend how this film could be anything less than stellar, yet it is.""Hey, guys, we hauled a big camera up Everest. Neat, huh?"" And that's about it. Something of a disappointment."
2,They could have done a better job,You should watch this movie before reading 'Into Thin Air'. Though the photography is nice (and I would imagine it must have taken a lot of effort and hardship to carry the photography equipments up there) the DVD lacks the details!!They spent a lot of time talking about preparations and focusing on the lower camps and missed out the high camp and the summit.(...)
1,Some good shots of the valley leading to base camp,"If you want to get a sense of what it is like to climb Everest, listen to (or read) Into Thin Air. If you want to see what Everest looks like, check out the web sites with photos. Even the third grade class site. The shots over the crevasses are clearly thought to be the money shots, but I wasn't taken by them. The areas I wanted to get a better sense of (the balcony, the rocky steps, the Hillary Step. the summit even), I didn't. Most of these shots were movies without much movement, and I didn't get an understanding of where they fit on the mountain. The voice over was vaguely trite, with nothing memorable. The helicopter shots up the approaching valley however, I have not seen anywhere else. I also saw this in an IMAX theatre a year ago, but it did not get my interest in Everest as Into Thin Air has."
1,It's not even good enough to be a commercial for the real...,"Pretty pictures... but not even enough of those can cover up my displeasure of the portrayal of Everest. For one, this film is inaccurate in a few instances (like when Beck is taken by helicopter), and totally portrays Everest as your basic summer vacation. This is what lyes farthest from the truth, and the portrayal of the actual dangers and accomplishments there of are very very very thin. I would give this at most 1/2 stars, but the system doesn't let me. I'm very disapponted."
3,Expectations & Complaints,"After reading all of the drivel concerning this DVD I have an opinion I'd like to share. Upon hearing of Everest I immediately built some expectations, namely I wanted to see compelling, dramatic footage of the mountain that's killed so many. What I got was much different than I had expected, to say the least. After I had recovered from the damage of my expectations I realized that the footage the crew captured was truly breathtaking, not so much because of great cinemaphotography but more over because they had gotten any footage at all. I loved this DVD because I was shown a part of the world I'll likely never see and I am grateful a crew risked their lives to bring this to film.If you want drama, read Krakauer's book, if you want a view of the top of the world with an interesting story, buy the DVD."
3,Watch the bonus material especially,"The extended interview with Beck Weathers was riveting! Very intelligent, heartful man.The Weathers interview really shows how someone just telling a story - no music, just a human recounting an experience - can mesmerize & trump the most spectacular scenery.The documentary itself had wonderful, impressive Everest shots; but as someone else here observed, there was a ""Disney-esque"" feel about it - swelling theatrical music & not a real sense of the tragedy of what happened on Everest in May 1996.The ""making of"" bonus material was much more interesting, esp. since it didn't have that ""you must be awed!"" IMAX music & had fewer of those somewhat condescending religious-ritual re-enactments.I'm still woozy from that ""climber's eye view"" shot of crossing a ladder over a deep crevasse in the Icefall.And the IMAX view of the climb of the Spanish lady up that rock-cliff in the sea was great!"
3,"Famous Film, Bad Quality Media","Short (45min.), quasi-plot-driven, and too brief for character development, it could have been better. That being said, it's IMAX film, so the fact they got one of those hulking cameras up to the summit *makes* this film.Unfortunately, this DVD-quality 4:3 version doesn't do the cinematography and film quality justice. Wait for the blu-ray version."
3,"Nice cinematography, but that's about it","This movie is not about the 1996 Everest disaster. It's a documentary about Everest that was being filmed at the same time the 96 disaster happened. And filming wasn't stopped to aid in stranded climbers, filming had stopped 2 days prior when the IMAX's first summit attempt was put on hold because of bad weather. Overall, the movie is good with some great shots of Everest and the local scenery. Liam Neeson's voice drop is a great touch. Keep in mind that this movie was made for an IMAX big screen theater so it's more based on seeing the beauty of Everest, not the facts of climbing her. If you want good accounts of climbing Mt. Everest, try ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston DeWalt. peace...."
3,Free Fall,"This is a good film overall, and has quality DVD images, photography and sound. What lacks though is any length or suspense to the film. I think more editing at the tables could have made this film more of a feature. The photography is just that, snap shots. The narrative is scripted, and much of the climb in the film recreated not at Everest, but instead in the United States. Special features of the DVD fall short of what to be expected for the purchase price, such as a trailer not even for this film, but for another. The extended Beck Weathers interview is better than the film. For Everest documentaries, look for National Geographic specials. I recommend this film as a rental, and not an expensive purchase for your collection."
2,"Yet another Everest film, but routine","Filmed depictions of the ascent of Mt. Everest are beginning to pile up like firewood. This one's claim to fame is that it is in the IMAX format. However, I watched it at home on a regular screen, and that renders it very routine compared to some others I've seen. Moreover, this climb coincided with a far more fateful one in which several climbers perished. The people in this film seem to make it to the top like rabbits and then hurry back down with no drama whatsoever. Left unaddressed in this film, and in many Everest films, is the question is why these people risk their lives when this climb has become almost routine? It seems to be a personal goal for most, but the chances of dying are so high as to create questions of sanity."
3,"Not bad, but the actual movie called Everest ""starring"" William Shatner is better.","This documentary gives you a taste of what the other Everest movie delivers in abundance and with an actual storyline, the 1982 Canadian Everest expedition. It seems that this documentary unfortunately is well known for the tragic deaths in the other expedition that occurred at the same time. Still, great cinematography. IMAX is obviously it's other draw.But again, see the little known movie Everest with Shatner and Jason Priestly. It's excellent. Good story and acting, amazing cinematography, and it chronicles actual events."
3,TOO SHORT,"After reading into thin air.. needless to say, I was expecting perhaps too much. Their is only about 14-20 minutes of footage of the actual everest climb. I understand this was a difficult shoot.. but I was frustrated the whole time waiting to see the climb.This is only ok."
1,Sir Edmund Would Not Be Happy,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" I decided to give the IMAX version a peek since The IMAX folks were depicted as good citizens. However, the DVD was simply horrible. The only good part was the Beck Weathers extended interview. After being very excited to watch Everest, I was left completely underwhelmed.It was plain bad."
1,Don't expect much... seriously!,"I heard alot about ""Into Thin Air"" and this IMAX film, so when it was released on DVD, I had to get it. Unfortunately, this film is amazingly bland and artificial. The movie is ""peppered"" with video-game-like graphics. I've honestly seen better ornamentation in corporate PowerPoint presentations. The viewer gets no sense of the drama of what actually occurred (at least 7 people died on Everest while the film was shot). Liam Neeson's narration only heightens the artificial feel of this film. There has been much talk of the frozen bodies still on Everest. You will not find them in this Disney-esque feature. If you're thinking ""K2"" or ""Vertical Limit,"" you are way off base. Heidi's climb to Grandpapa's chalet in the 1968 classic was more action-packed and realistically staged."
3,Everest,"If you've read ""Into Thin Air"", you'll be disappointed in the film's inability to capture the human drama and hardships of the climbers. It is interesting, however, to see the scenery that you read about in the book.The film is only 45 minutes long - not a real good price-performer. The additional material is very good though - the interview with Beck Weathers is by far the most impactful piece of this disk."
3,"unforgettable images, but . . .","I'm interested in Mt. Everest as an unstable environment. On Everest, especially in the Death Zone, one's assumptions regarding reality and knowledge are swept away. This film gave me an unforgettable series of pictures of this environment: hurricane force winds, infinitely deep crevasses, and looming cliffs, seracs, and ridges. I saw the forces that make Mt. Everest a metaphor for temperamental and demanding gods. My disappoinment in the film was in the narration, interviews, and music soundtrack. I didn't find the climbers very interesting, George Harrison's music too often seemed insipid and out of place, and Liam Neeson's narration was predictable, even banal. I'll keep watching this video. I love the images. But, I'll often mute the sound and fast forward through the interviews."
2,A Good Documentary,"If you expect tense action and suspense, you will be disappointed. This is a documentary with fabulous photography and loads of DVD features. I was expecting more, but I don't think the IMAX feature can be captured in a ""home cinema"" (I have a 41"" tv). I wouldn't recommend this film unless you are a mountain climber (an interest alone is not enough) or have a special interest in Everest. In any case, check the film run time before giving up the $$."
3,Discovery Channel Series was better,"I became interested in Everest from watching the Discovery Channel's series about reaching the summit. I was really excited to get this DVD especially because I'd heard it was filmed the same year as the 1996 disaster on Everest. I have to admit I was disappointed. It was very short and didn't get as much into the ""science"" of climbing Everest as much as it just showed the scenery. I would rent this, but wouldn't buy again."
2,Was this a movie about BASE CAMP?,"I bought this expecting to see many wonderous things. What I got was a dull narrative, a bunch of scenes that do not belong on 70mm (packing / unpacking / talking on a telephone / assembly-line lunch) and very little footage of the mountain or climbing. Why would I want to see this on DVD or VHS without the benefit of WideScreen footage anyway? I am pretty disappointed with the whole package. I would guess that the camera crew go gun-shy after the tradgedy that claimed 8 lives. As a result, we see the rear of the climbers, mostly, and shots from conservative angles. They said that helicopters had a hard time getting up that high due to the lack of air. What about aeroplane shots? I think this project, derailed by tragedy, should have stayed that way. The result is piecemeal, at best. Some nice deleted scenes, though.I sure sound bitter, don't I? It's not that bad, I just expected more from IMAX."
1,how not to photograph climbing mt. everest,"this is a MUST NOT buy. the commentary sounds as if it were written by a teenager. the story -too short- spends too little time on the climb and too much on extraneous matters. climbing mt. everest is a horrendously difficult task but this movie makes it appear not too hard. there are a few scenes of climbing and though i accept the photos taken at the summit are real, all the others could have been taken anywhere there was snow and ice. if this is the best these movie makers could do, they should look for another day job.unfortunately my copy, new, was bothered by a sound track with bad hum and noise, so loud that at times the commentary, thankfully, could not be heard.this is not recommended for adding to anyone's collection."
2,Don't waste your money...,"A hugely overrated film. I bought it because I'd read Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"" and knew that this film purported to cover, in part, the tragedy of the expedition described in Krakauer's book. Well, the film shows basically nothing of that expedition, and mentions it only very lightly. The whole depiction is without drama or suspense of any kind -- very unlike Krakauer's book, it utterly fails to capture the tension of Everest climbing. The photography is nice, but the lack of substance is a real show-stopper."
2,Be careful what you read,"This book is a discussion, at times long-winded, that is centered around a free speech court case pitting former employees against their employer. It wasn't long before I realized that the overall viewpoint of this tome was slanted towards the former employees, due to the ""victim"" theme that permeates from chapter to chapter.It's a shame their efforts fell short, because this is a unique case that deserves to be heard. However, in the end I felt I only heard one side of the story, and was left wanting to hear the other. Had the authors presented a more balanced reporting of the situation, I might have considered a higher recommendation. That was not the case, so I could only give it two stars for effort, and nothing more."
3,"Good album, but not as good as I expected.","First of all, my biggest and only problem with this album is the backing vocals. eh, this guy's voice is so damn annoying. Other than that, it's a good album. Probably my least favorite out of all the Nekromantix albums. I would freaking love if the Nekromantix would redo this album with todays line up. Now that would rock! The sandorff brothers are awesome!"
3,One of the good 80s slasher flicks,"Girls Nite Out is a whodunit slasher flick, just as many horror flicks of that time were,and it has the typical stalk and kill scenes and has great murder sequences. Has a huge twist at the end as to who the killer is and many suspensful moments in between. There are better slasher films (such as Prom Night and The Burning) and yet there are much much worse( THe Majorettes, and the Forest) so Girls Nite Out is not that bad compared to many and stands among some of the above average as being well made, well directed, ( for it has great atmosphere and lighting) and cool death scenes, some even pre-date nightmare on elm street with the four bladed claw!!! Overall a very entertaining and standard slasher flick and is a must buy for slasher fans!"
1,Its not good,"This CD says :""by Celine Dion"" However, the one I received says ""these songs are recreations and are not performed by the original artist."" Look at other CD's."
3,Pages missing from book,I realize this item was used so I was prepared for some wear and tear but the last ten or so pages of the book are missing! Very disappointing. I purchase used books frequently and have never received one that had pages missing. The seller should inspect their books a little closer before listing them or at least mention the missing pages in the listing. Now I'll have to by another copy of this book to know how it ends :(
5,Maximum Impact,"This biography beats any other book on Divine by a long shot. ""NOT SIMPLY DIVINE"" is nothing compaired to this title. Who else could write a better book that Glens own mother. Even if shes not a author and has chopy sentences and bad grammer, she still and will always know Glen better than anybody. Sad, funny, serious, angry, and confusing are all the emotions that this book holds. The short life of Divine is very well told in this book along with great never before seen picture of Divine. Frances Vukovich Milstead did a excelent job on this project; and lets not forget the co author Steve Yeager who has been following John Waters and Divine scence Pink Flamingos."
3,AVERAGE,"not a bad price.but its not a heavy as a regular corn knife, thus it takes more effort and a harderchop..Now i know why the tapered ones work better..its because of the extra weight at theend.."
4,The last days of the Luftwaffe,"Jahannes Steinhoff was one of the top fighter pilots for the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. In this book he recounts how late in the war, he and his fellow pilots became increasingly disillusioned with their leadership (in particular that of Goring) and how they set about trying to restore the Luftwaffe to its former glory in a last ditch effort to defend the Reich. It makes for very interesting reading for anyone with an interest in this time period, but I for one try to remain a little sceptical when it comes to such memoirs. The book has been reissued with the title The Final Hours."
2,save your money for the upcoming album.,"I'm a huge fan, but this dvd was a huge dissapointment. The accoustic performance are sloppy and the sound is weak. The electric cuts are also rough, but I'd blame this on the tiny crowd they are playing for. So, save your money for their new cd and watch pbs for scenic shot of Hwaii."
1,I expected better....,"Man, this dvd is absolutely terrible. I bought it like 10 years ago and turned around and sold it on amazon. Like the other review said, abe's the only ON in Hawaii and I never thought Chino could sound so bad. I want to see dEFTONES performing their high energy concerts, not watching boring acoustic stuff played sloppy. I'm not sure what they were thinking when they released this! Check out Area 4 Live or Deftones Pinkpop 2003 on youtube to see a genuine dEFTONES show. I expect much better from them. I have dEFTONES concerts on dvd(thankfully) so i can live without this!"
4,"Happy, well adjusted women sharing their stories.","What a concept! So often these days it seems that we only hear from those people who are unhappy and seem to want to make everyone else feel unhappy, too. And these women share something deep and meaningful about what is really important in their lives. And to be able to say that what is so meaningful is God! I am truly amazed. I enjoyed the book very, very much."
5,Anyone who has ever wondered about nuns should read this.,"I wish this book had been around when I was a young girl being taught by Catholic nuns. Ms. Losada succeeds in unravelling the mysteries surrounding,and sometimes the stigma attached to, these incredibly dedicated, happy and well-adjusted women. I give 5 stars to each of the nuns for their candor and their willingness to share themselves with us,and 5 stars to the author for giving them the venue to do so. I only wish the author had had more to say because her writing style was insightful, humorous, and refreshing. I hope there is more to come from her."
2,Insightful but with a sad undertone,"Surely, it will fascinate those unfamiliar with religious Sisters to read of the personal vocations of those interviewed. Many myths about convent life and those who choose it undoubtedly will be dispelled. Yet there was a certain disappointment in the presentation, where the trendy need to be ""relevant"" if not ""cool"" pointed out deficiencies which have arisen in a solid understanding of the consecrated life.What lady with dignity would speak of past ""relationships""? And for a nun to do so shows, sadly, that even many who are vowed to celibacy do not consider past fornication or concubinage to be wrong. This is not to say that the past keeps God from calling one later, but to refer to it so casually seems to indicate it was ""no big deal"" in the first place."
2,"Don't count on the repeater part, but it's a fine female-female adapter.","I purchased this item because the Bluray player/15ft hdmi/projector combo wasn't linking up right. It was cheap and might work for shorter runs, but I had to get a powered one instead."
1,Does not work,Setup is: PC - 6ft hdmi - repeater - 30ft hdmi - Lcdtv. In this setup this thing does not work at all.
1,Not quite there,"Setup: Sony PS3 connected to a Harman Kardon AVR254 with a 1M Monster 1000 cable. Harman Kardon receiver to Samsung A550 TV via 35' Monster 800 cable.Put the extender in on both sides using a piece of monster 1000 1m cable, while there was less snow, it was still there...Will be purchasing another unit and hoping for better luck!"
2,"Basically useless, just a pretty booklet","We had purchased this book for our 11-year-old son, and quickly found it insufficient. So it went to our 9-year-old. We tried to use it for fourth grade homework this week, and it has so little information it's not even funny. It wasn't helpful at all.It's a pretty book though. It would be a nice thing for a preschooler through maybe first grade, for an aspiring scholar who craved the excitement of maps and world words, but didn't really need any hard information out of it."
4,Ayn Rand could have written this book.,"But she didn't. Someone else did, nearly a century before anyone had ever heard of Ayn Rand. Yet somehow Ayn Rand got the credit for ""originating"" the philosophy in this book.Perhaps Stirner's mistake was becoming an essayist instead of a novelist."
5,Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit,"It was at a good price. It arrived in good condition, and it works good with my boyfriend's Original Xbox."
3,"Doubles your xbox as a DVD Player, but lots of cons","PROS- works fine. No IR connection problems.- great for people that don't already have a DVD player.CONS- doesn't play DVDs in progressive scan. Why not? They can make games in 480p (old HD) for the xbox.- takes up a controller port slot. Not a big deal, but if you often have 4 friends playing, you won't be able to leave it in all the time.- no backlit or glow- no eject button- no power button. What? Never seen a remote without a power button. Thus you CANNOT turn your xbox on/off with this remote.- cannot learn- not universal. If you have lots of remotes, you're better off learning this one into a universal remote.- many people already own a DVD player, many with progressive scan."
2,For XBOX Original NOT 360 - leaving this review so you don't make the same mistake we did,This only works with the original Xbox (we believe). We bought this to work with our Xbox 360 and can't seem to figure out where you plug it in to the console. Returning it.
4,As good as I remembered.,"Saw this made for tv movie in 1971, when I was in 13. My daughter and I heard the Jefferson Airplane song and she mentioned that she had read the book several times and loved it. She was suprised when I told her about the movie. So began our search to find if it was available. Within minutes found in on Amazon. Not up to the current movie techinical standards that she is used to but we enjoyed it just the same. She said it was better then she thought it would be. Good lesson on how drugs can destroy a life."
3,Good tool for teaching of the drug culture,"O.K. The film is dated, but the allusion to Grace Slick's lyrics in White Rabbit say it all. This movie is relatively short, but still packs a punch in dealing with the modern drug culture. Today it's pain pills. Then it was speed, LSD and heroin. The message remains the same--stay away from drugs or pay the consequences. Good for all young people to view."
5,Excellent Book!,I thought that this book was really great! If you are an EMT or looking to become an EMT or just have a general interest in Emergency Medicine I highly recommend this book. I have already read this book as well as EMT race for life and I am currently reading Rescue Alert. All of them I think are great!
3,Needs a fresher angle,"Now I know a series must try to follow from one story to another, but The Demon King seems to have a lot of rehashing of the first book with the main character, Damastes, losing happiness, gaining happiness, and then losing it again. It would have been a lot more refreshing to find a new story or any signs of intricate plot twists, but how many times can you use a maddened peasant mob running amuck? Overall, it was a very good story on it's own, but as a follow up to his previous work, Chris Bunch leaves this reader hoping that the sequel will finally not have another riot of peasants killing everything in sight and a give us a better understanding of more of the characters than just the gloomy atmosphere of Damastes."
5,FLCL Fabric Poster,I bought this for my son and he loved it. It was much nicer than I thought it would be...great buy and good quality.
4,Intruder in the Dust,"The movie ""Intruder in the Dust"" takes some liberties in changing the details, but the storyline remains consistent with the book. Faulkner (and the movie) included some over-the-top social-statement lines -- an unheard of thing for the times, but effective. Movie is very good on several levels."
2,DVD would not play in my DVD player,"I know this is a great movie. However, it would not play on my DVD player. Could it be a bootleg copy?"
1,Weak content - just a money grab!,"STOP Don't buy it ! It's awful and poorly written. Nothing you can't get on the internet. Just Google ""How to Start a Seminar Business"" , or get the book by Alan Weiss's book Money Talks. Much more credible and workable."
2,How to Develop and Promote Successful Seminars and Workshops,IMHO the book by Shenson is much better. If I had thumbed through this book at the bookstore it would still be on the shelf.
1,Don't bother,Another self published book from a self promoting author. Outdated to say the least. There is nothing more than common sense in this book.
2,Feel a little ripped off,"I was encouraged to read this since I've been on Fred Gleek's mailing list for a while now, but the book was like a running ad for his products and his pals' products with a little bit of wisdom thrown in. For me, it was a waste of time. I much prefer Speak and Grow Rich by Dottie and Lilly Walters."
5,Write Said Fred,Fred Gleeck is cutting edge. I've read many of the other seminar/publishing authors and Fred eclipses them all. His background in psychology and marketing is the ideal combination for insightful advice. His more the 15 years actual experience in doing what he preaches is more then anyone can rightfully ask for in a guru. I am saving thousands of dollars from just one tip I got from this program. I will save thousands more from consultation work with him compared with what is being offered by other experts. You can expect to save thousands of dollars and make tens of thousands of dollars more as a result of reading and following his advice. Buy everything he offers. I did!
4,Great art...totally worthless text,"HCB was a master of the type of photography he practiced. The photographs speak for themselves. They are beautiful, they are classic and they will always transcend any words people speak about them. So, what's the point in weighing down the impact of these photographs with a text that is so pretentious and unreadable it turns off everyone but the pretentious reader?Buy this book. It is one of my favorites on Cartier-Bresson. Look at the photographs first and you will gain respect and appreciation for the photographer. But only skim the text."
4,The best published collection of HCB's pictures?,"The best published collection I've seen of Henri Cartier-Bresson's pictures, from some of the famous shots of the 30s and 40s (God how I hate that smirking brat with the wine bottles. Put me off appreciating HC-B for a long time) to some of the wonderfully impressionistic later landscapes.The text ... well, buy the book for the pictures and look at them. Typically pretentious and impenetrable academic French art crticism, translated in the English edition in a way that still manages to read like pretentious and impenetrable academic French.But did I mention the pictures?"
5,Great examples from the book for subfile programmers,A great resource for subfile programming! The authors had done their homework on subfiles. This book is a must...for your library and for work.
3,Some nice techniques...,"This book showed some very nice subfile techniques, although I have to wonder if some of them would ever be worth the extra coding involved (e.g. multiple views vs. multiple line subfiles). I had problems executing the files on the diskette that came with it and, therefore, couldn't get the code to upload to my AS/400."
4,excellent read about the everyday life of a seaman,as an ex merchant mariner the book brings back memories of how it was on an everyday basis for three buddies going to sea-details of which you dont hear about normally.Humorous reality.
5,Tales of Woody Guthrie & Cisco Houston as told by Jim Longhi,"When people look back at the life and times of Woody Guthrie, it's often with a dry, highfalootin' academic tilt. Indeed, such a perspective seems out of place when confronted with the reality of Guthrie's life. Jim Longhi provides a firsthand account of who Woody Guthrie and Cisco Houston really were. The result is a document that is poignant, and uproariously funny at the same time."
5,"so much common sense, it's uncommon","I had seen this book before, but never bought it. Figured it was too simplistic for me (a golfer who can hit some nice, powerful individual shots but just can't string them together over the course of a round). Figured I'd break 100 soon enough, just a matter of time away (along with that one good, elusive golf tip).Couple years later. I still haven't broken 100 on a par-72 yet, but I do have 20 or so golf books at home to keep me company. Decided this was not working (duh), so took a look at this book.I like this book for several reasons. It is very clearly organized...you can find what you're looking for. IMHO, there is enough quality info to get a golfer past 100 and beyond, but not so much information as to overwhelm the golfer. After you read through the sections on equipment, short game, full swing, course mgmt, etc., the book takes you through a week-by-week plan to reaching your goal."
5,Great comprehensive introduction to ancient Chinese history.,Volume is in English but has excellent Chinese characters (Hanzi) along with Hanyu Pinyin for Chinese terms. Very comprehensive summary (with photographs) of ancient Chinese History. Only thing missing is a .pdf version because this volume is heavy and difficult to travel with.
3,works sometimes,"I bough a few of these to have in various places.They are cheap but do the job.The one in the car though.... my iPhone 4 occasionally says the unit cannot be used to charge this devise. It may be the combination with the Griffin USB converter because this is the only one doing it. I will switch them around and try to rule this out.For the money they are worth having a few. One in each car, at the office and one in the bag."
4,"Good product, but I prefer the non-mint version.",I have used this floss for some time now and feel that it does a good job of eliminating plaques around the gum line. This is the first time I ordered the mint version of this product and do not like it as well. It is not as soft and pliable as the non-min version.
3,About 1/10th of the floss is usable,"Why doesn't every review say this? This floss is about 9/10ths uncoated cotton string or whatever, unusable in your mouth. About every foot or so is like 3 inches of blue/mint coated floss. So you're paying for a TON of filler and a little bit of floss.It mandates how much room you have to give to grip it; sorry, I don't need to wrap it around both hands twice. I'd prefer the blue part to either be the entire floss, or to be on-and-off every 6 inches or so, not every foot.As for how it is, it's pretty good; glides well, dispenses easily, and tastes fine. But I'm just sayin', I felt a little ripped off when I saw how the product was designed."
4,"Great floss, unsure about getting 6 units","Best floss I've ever used, but not the cheapest. I think better than Glide and various other flosses. Like other reviewers, I can't find the large size so I ordered it from Amazon around August 2005 but only got a *single* unit and not the *six* that was advertised. I didn't look at the reviews from at least as far back as January 2004 that said other customers also had this problem :-(. Amazon eventually fixed it, but there was the hassle factor involved. I am trying it again after reading a recent review that Amazon has fixed this problem."
2,Breaks and shreds,"I generally find Oral B products to be excellent. For example, their Satin Floss does a good job and holds up well. I have had a much different experience with this Ultra Floss, though. If you want a floss that shreds easily and then breaks, this is the one to get. I can generally get half or more of my flossing done and then the Ultra starts to shred, eventually often breaking. While it's whole, it works pretty well, but I will use up the one I have and then return to the Satin floss."
1,Did not work,I made a mistake when I decided to try a different hoodia product. This product had zero effect on me except to drain my bank account because they would not accept a refund. I dont think this is real hoodia. I will not make this mistake again.
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"This product is not all it's cracked up to be. I used it religiously for a couple of months, and really didn't notice any difference. No difference in appetite, in weight, in energy. Don't know if it was just me, or the product."
2,"fading, fading, gone","This movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books. Ethan Hawke leans to heavily on Kris Kristofferson's performances not to mention Jeff Tweedy's music. As a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music. It is written interestingly enough, but the visuals look like there wasn't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on. The best way to watch this movie is in the background. You don't need the visuals, and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away."
3,A poetic start,"Although it might seem a bit pretentious at start, the movie has great dialogues filled with poetry. It's also beatifully cut and the subtle connection between characters feels like a rough trip into people's desire to love and the lonelyness of urban human beings."
3,NOBLE EFFORT,"While an interesting effort, the most noteworthy scene is with the luminous TUESDAY WELD! I had almost fogotten what a terrifically talented and gorgeous actress she is. Acting students take note and watch her in action for she is the real thing. Why doesn't she work more? I didn't even realize she was in the movie and when I saw her scene, I was riveted. A true pro in every sense of the word. Only complaint was her role was too small. MORE TUESDAY!!"
1,La Stupidité absolue!,"Heureusement je n'ai pas acheté ce DVD: Je l'ai loué au videoclub de mon quartier. Et ils faut dire que j'ai passé presque deux heures d'ennui total!!! Tout est sombre dans ce film. Je parle pas de l'histoire mais de la qualité de l'image. On essaie de distinguer les personnages, mais en vain. De temps en temps on voit une partie du mur bien illuminé et c'est tout. Les acteurs il faut les chercher dans d'autres films. Remarquez, c'est beaucoup mieux pour eux. Car jouer dans un film pareil, c'est vraiment une honte. Ethan Hawke??? Je ne crois pas. Probablement il a preté son nom à un ami qui veut rester anonyme!!! On m'a dit que son second film est aussi insignifiant que celui-là!! Je me demande ou il trouve les producteurs111"
4,The Talented Ms. Highsmith.,"The Black House is a collection of eleven short stories written by highly acclaimed novelist Patricia Highsmith. All of the stories are good and a number of them are very good. Each story has a skillfully written narrative that unfolds smoothly as well as believable characters notable for their easily recognizable personality types.Many of the stories contain shocking plot twists designed to demonstrate the darkest aspects of human nature. In some cases these unexpected events are rather disturbing.Recommended to readers who appreciate ""slice of life"" stories and are not put off by the prospect of experiencing some viscerally uncomfortable moments along the way."
3,A collection of short stories by Patricia Highsmith.,"The Black House is a very unique book. You may think it sounds like a horror book. But it is really only scary in the way that people are in this book. It takes a while to become used to the author's style of writing, so you have to be patient. Some of these stories are very strange, be prepared. I found this book to be frusturating because it was so different.The author did a good job leaving you with a question at the end of each story."
4,Better than expected,"For a very inexpensive faux fur, this is not a bad product. I purchased it for weekends, as a trendy item, and it is definitely better quality than similarly priced items. However, do not expect a high-end faux fur, because this is definitely not it. Looks great with jeans, would not look great with an evening gown.I got the ombre and it has different fur textures and heights, giving it more dimension than expected. Also, it is long enough to actually play with, unlike some smaller pull-through fur scarves. There is a small pull through tab in the back of the scarf. However, it is not well sewn and there are loose threads that I keep having to cut off.Finally, it smelled odd coming out of the package, but that has dissipated after leaving it out for a day."
5,Beautiful Music,"The Cambridge Singers are the best when it comes to the music of John Rutter. Their sound is unmistakable and unable to be surpassed by any other group. Their Latin pronunciation is perfect and a lot more elaborate than others. The sound is very modern and captures the delicacy and the grandeur of this magical piece by Rutter.The Magnificat, is, in my opinion, the greatest work of John Rutter, much better than the Requiem. The Requiem is soft and dull, while the Magnificat is jocund and full of exsquisite and sentimental tones that can only be found in Rutter music.The Falcon is an interesting piece, one of Rutter's earliest. It features mediaeval texts. It may not have the melodies of the Magnificat, but it is still interesting. The Two Festival Anthems are an excellent addition as well and evoke the power of religious music."
3,"Not as ""Prime"" as hoped.","We sent these to Idaho for Christmas, and my obnoxious sister-in-law, barely remembering to say thankyou, tells me they are no better than can be bought in the local store. Not having tasted them, I can only take her word for it, so I apologize if she's full of it. I CAN say I won't be sending them to her again(or much of anything else)."
1,How does one justify the cost?,"OK... USDA Prime is the good stuff, rarely available in neighborhood grocery stores. But some stores (like mine) do carry Prime at the meat counter, at $16 - $24 a .lb depending on your cut.How does anyone justify dropping $30 + a pound (plus shipping!) for a piece of meat that is MAYBE, NOMINALLY better than Choice if your pallette can even differentiate?!?At these prices go to a high end steak joint and saveur the whole experience."
1,Way too slippery!,"I found this floss very frustrating to use. It kept slipping out of my fingers and it was impossible to get a good grip on it. We normally use Crest Glide but for some reason my husband just bought Oral-b Satin instead. It is much harder to use than Glide and I did not feel like it cleaned as well either, even though it took twice as long! I'll stick with Crest Glide."
2,"Terrible product, I'll stick to Crest Glide.","I'm a big proponent of the new ""strip"" based tape dental flosses, and am primarily a user of Crest's Glide floss. I saw Oral-B's alternative in the store one day, and decided to give it a try.I am not impressed at all. First, the dispensing mechanism seems to prevent more than an inch of tape from being taken at any one time; the spindle that it's located on somehow gets stuck easily. Second, the dental floss tape itself has a terrible feeling of hard plastic, and it not only is incapable of cleaning your teeth well, but is also uncomfortable to use. Crest Glide by comparison is soft and pliable yet strong enough to clean your teeth. Third, the minty aftertaste was very mild and almost non-existent.If I wanted to clean my teeth with plastic strings, I could just go to my local party store and buy some of the ribbons for cheaper."
3,My favorite floss,"I was happy to see this after I ran out of my last pack.This is my favorite floss. It gets into those reallytight spots.I was sad to see that my $25 purchase of a 12-pack was shippedto me as just one pack. Seems this is a recurring problem.They say they have shipped a new one (12-pack, I hope), whichis pretty fast. But I have to ship back the one package or they willcharge my credit card for it. I can't find a price for one, and don'tknow if they get me for shipping, so maybe I'll send it back ascheaply as I can. Sigh.Update 1. They sent me another one. Another 1!So then they said forget it, we can do it. So I sent bothback.Eventually I asked. They said they didn't have it.Then, they said they'd send maybe another, but eventuallydid credit me.So, it worked out, but they obviously have some problems withthis problem, which is too bad."
1,Horrible floss,It is too slippery and you can't get a grip on the floss. It doesn't get the plaque off either. It simply doesn't work. I would never buy this floss again.
4,NY History,"This is a good book to add to one's library as part of NY History! It is a must for ""aware"" Hispanic New Yorkers!"
1,Banal Regurgitations,"Let's keep in mind that Hall wrote back in the 1930s and 1940s, when there was far less in print on esoterica than today. Still, Hall's book on gnosticism is overly complicated and terribly pedantic. One has the sense, too, that Hall is regurgitating received ideas. There is no hint of real scholarship, or of an individual approach to the material. I'm biased, however, by the fact that Hall fancied himself as a master of all esoterica, given the breadth of his writings. If I knew as much about anything as Hall knows about everything . . . Add to this Hall's fervent championing of freemasonry as a repository of real wisdom, and one has to wonder who Hall was, and where he got the ego to appoint himself as an authority on sacred teachings. There are far better books on gnosticism."
1,Not in a class with the Oral B 60's of yesteryear,"The current generation of Oral B 60 manual toothbrush is not of the quality and effectiveness of those designed and manufactured during the late 1960's and 1970's. The Oral B 60 medium of the past was rectangular, larger in surface area and longer lasting. They were more effective at cleaning and gum massage than the current generation. The new product is not unsafe, just relatively ineffective. It would be such a great pleasure to locate a source of the old-style manual toothbrush. The search goes on ..."
1,misleadiing photo,what was delivered to me WAS NOT THE TOOTHBRUSH LIKE THE ONE SHOWN IN THE PHOTO!i am absolutely unhappy with the toothbrushes they delivered. it was NOT AT ALL what i wanted and thought i was paying for.
1,Wrong Item,I ordered a 6 pack basing my selection on the picture and got a different toothbrush. The picture needs to be changed as it is VERY misleading.
4,Very smooth coffee,I bought this coffee for trying a new coffee and was pleasantly surprised with the smooth taste of this coffee. Highly recommended.
3,It's adorable!,"I bought this set, and my daughter loves it , she's going to be 2 in a month and she loves it!"
1,Beware: Purple is not available!,"I really like this product, but when i ordered it on Amazon, the picture of the product is clearly purple and white. I ordered this specific product from Kaplan becuase i was looking for something purple. When the product arrived, it was pink and white. When i called customer service, i was informed that the product does not come in purple...just pink, and that the photo online must be a discoloration of some kind. That is ridiculous. As of 12/21/07, the picutre online is purple and white with no possible way that it could be a pink color image that somehow looks purple. I am dissapointed with the order discription and image Kaplan has online at Amazon, and their customer service response."
3,Item size is small,"I had purchased this as a gift for a child who is 8 yrs old. The item is described as fitting ages 5,6,7,8, but it fit more for a 3 yr old. Although the neck & waist may be adjustable, the apron itself was too small to properly cover her without it making her look like she's wearing a toddler's outfit. She immediately gave it away."
3,"Cute, but not as pictured!","This item is very cute and nicely made. However, as one reviewer mentioned before about the purple color pictured and the pink color arriving, the photo is NOT accurate. I purchased this set thinking it was white and PASTEL pink as shown, to match my daughter's new kitchen set. It arrived cream and hot pink. It is the same items, but the color is way off. In terms of size, it is a bit small. I would say this would best fit a child no older than an average 4 year old, although it's stated as a 3+ toy. It fits my 2.5 year old well. Great items if you aren't as picky with the color and are shopping for a toddler instead of a little girl."
4,Great for your little helper,My daughter loves this! She wants to help in the kitchen all the time and now she has her own items. My daughter is 4 but actually the size of a 6-7 year old. The oven mit and pot holder could be a little bigger. The apron adjusts so she should be able to wear it for a while. The towel is the perfect size for her to dry dishes. We love it and look forward to preparing many meals together.
3,KItchen accessories--toddler,"This chef set is very cute and our 2 year old loves playing with it in her kitchen. The oven mitt is a little big for her hand, but she will be able to use it for as long as she plays with the kitchen. Also, the apron size is adjustable with velcro, but I need to add more velcro to it so that I can make it smaller around her neck--it hangs down too long even on the shortest setting. That's an easy fix, but I wish they had put more velcro on to start with so that it could be made even smaller. It would also be nice if the set came in a more unisex color."
2,okay for the money but the chef hat was too small,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter whose daddy is a chef. She likes to emulate her father so I ordered this set, and he wanted her to wear it when he needed to take her along on a catering job.She looked really cute, but the oven mitt was way too big for her little hand and the chef's hat was much too small. Her mom had to snip the seam on the back of the hat just to get it to partially sit on top of her head. An adjustable velco band for the hat would have been better: one size hat definitely does not fit all."
3,A Mixed Bag,"One key thing to remember about the O'Reilly Developer Notebook series ... be prepared to supplement your learning with other material. I knew this going into the new book on Spring, so I wasn't surprised that much of the information was brief. I did find that the book contained useful information and got me up to speed with Spring fairly quickly. I like the example driven nature of the Developer Notebook series.Unfortunately, there's a downside. This book is littered with errors and typos and the examples presented are largely incomplete. (I'm compiling a list at the moment to submit to the errata page for the book at O'Reilly.) Also, do not go to the O'Reilly web site looking for the samples to download, they are available only on author Justin Gehtland's web site.Ultimately, the book provides a good and very brief introduction to many elements of the Spring framework ... but prepare yourself for frustration after frustration when trying to get the examples working yourself."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"I read 14 pages and more than half of codes have errors or typos.I doubt if author understand th contents. He keeps in describing the feeling about programming. he does not explain about what it means, or how it works. Do not buy this book, it is waste of your money and time."
1,Oops! Mr Tate did it again,"I heard that Spring was the next big thing in Java Web programming, so I purchased this book by O'Reilly. Most of the time I'm pleased with O'Reilly's books. Not this time.This 200page books is virtually useless, full of Mr Tate's personal kayaking experience and little Spring. I instantly remembered ""Bitter Java"" from the same author, which was also more like a Sports Illustrated than a computing title. I don't understand why people keep buying Mr Tate's computer books, even though there is more telling about his muscular sport encounters than Java code.It could be just me, who cannot find useful technical tips between kayaking stories, but for sure I'll need another Spring book."
2,"Title should be, ""Austin Extreme Sports Notebook""","There's practically more content in this book about Mr. Tate's extreme sports exploits and Austin civic boosterism than there is about Spring. Ended up taking this book back.It's a shame -- Mr. Tate is a good, clear, concise writer. But enough already. The kayaking and mountain biking anectodes serve NO instructive purpose, offer no entertainment value, and are especially out of place in a supposedly brief ""developer's notebook."" Stop trying to find some way to inject into your books that: 1) you're such a total extreme sports stud; and 2) that you think Austin is the best city in the world (even though it hardly is)."
4,Fun to sing along,"I bought this for listening practice several years ago as the choir I joined was singing some songs in this CD. It's still fun to sing along when I play this CD today. Wonderful songs, simple lyrics."
4,Motorcraft DY1004 Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor,"I bought this item for a 2003 Ford Explorer XLT and I received it in perfect condition, original packaging and just in time. Thank you!"
4,"Informative, inclusive, well documented research....","I found Lipman-Blumen's model to be fascinating and informative. Her central contention is that people lead in situational and contextual ways and hence, there should not be one model for leadership. I believe that Lipman-Blumen's model is more inclusive of a variety of leadership styles and tells leaders in industry and higher education that they need to be well-versed in the various leadership styles to be effective. I also found her chapter dealing with women informative in that she explains how judging women leaders based on masculine values of competition, domination, etc. is oxymoronic and how her model is more inclusive of their values/styles as well. I would have liked to have seen more inclusion of leaders of color and how her model impacts those leaders included in the discussion but nice job overall."
4,Expansion Pack Rocks!!!,"This expansion pack is ""beyond words."" It has a whole new age, which is the Space Epoch. Plus, it comes with three new campaigns. This is definetely worth the money."
5,THE BEST STRATEGY GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you like Red Alert 2, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology... you will love this. In the Art Of Contest there is a bunch of new things! A new age:space age with a bunch of ships, 18 new campaigns In multiplayer mode new places like the Moon,Mars and In senario editor and campaign editor you can invent people."
5,Chi Rocket Blow Dryer,"This is an amazing blow dryer. When my old one finally died, I was immediately on a mission to replace it with the ""EXACT"" same one. Once again, I am a very satisfied customer with this Chi Rocket product. Works great and dries you hair in lightning speed, all without damaging or drying out your hair."
4,Chi Rocket Rocks,"expensive, but this is a great blow dryer. extremely fast drying and quiet. its heavy - but love the low emf. i don't have one, but my hairdresser and another friend swear by the chi straightner."
1,FAKE,"This was a horrible product - a complete fake. It looked extremely cheap, and when i plugged it in and turned it on, and it would not even get hot. Amazon charged me for returning it too. I would NOT recommend this purchase - its better to spend the extra money on a real one from a reputable retail store."
2,Chi Rocket,"Amazon was fantastic about my returning this product!!! However, it has a burning smell for a few seconds every time I turned it on and then had a high pitch squeal. When I did return it, Amazon made the process easy and refunded my money quickly!"
1,Sparks fly catches Fire!,This is a horrible company. They are producing dryers they know spark and catch on FIRE! Their dryers are a fire hazard & they know it! They make it difficult to return. Charge for shipping and replacements and you pay to ship FIRE HAZARD back! Then the new one does the same thing that is why you see them at marshalls and TJ maxx! Be vary careful! This is a horrible company and they need to protect consumers against Chi!
1,Don't buy it for the low EMF claim,"Update: We bought the Bion IPX4 wall-mounted dryer with the motor on the wall, so one can keep the distance and reduce EMF exposure. Unfortunately, it's likely discontinued.Most if not all ""low EMF"" claim for dryers is a marketing gimmick. How they do it? ""Low EMF hair dryers use an elongated tube to route hot air to your hair without placing the motor/heater assembly close to your head.""Farouk doesn't even know what EMF is. In its presss release for the launch of its Valentines Day Limited Edition, Farouk spells out EMF as ""electro-magnetic force"". Well, that EMF is Einstein's concern, whereas ours is ""electro-magnetic field"".It's also utter nonsense that ""moist heat that dries hair quicker"". Moisture in the air always slows down water evaporation, that's why we take wet towel out of shower enclosure to dry.So buy a long tube with lower wattage from Target or Walmart, save money, save energy while also saving yourself from EMF exposure."
5,Better than I hoped.,Dries my hair in half the time. Best one I have ever had. Even has rubber grips that keep it from slipping off the counter. Who could ask for more? ;)
2,Great dryer ... for a while,"My husband bought me a Chi Rocket dryer in August 2007 for $135, which to me was a fortune for a dryer. It was absolutely wonderful for a little over two years, when it just up and quit on me. When I called Farouk about getting it fixed, I was told they would only fix them for two years after the purchase, and I was about 90 days over that. I can't see ever spending that much for a dryer again, I definitely didn't get $135 use out of it. I guess it's back to Walmart dryers again. The one my husband's using is about four years old and cost $40!"
5,Girlfriend loves it.,Everything she wanted and more. Bought it here for less than half of the cost of a beauty supply store. Heats up fast and the cool button works in an instant. Has a lot of velocity and on high temp. it gets very hot. Most people can get by on the low heat setting.
5,Great hairdryer!,"A little noisier than my last Chi, but definitely is a great dryer. I have thick, course hair and when I am done, it is smooth and dry! Also dries faster than my other dryer, which is important because I have longer, fuller hair!"
5,Great Hair Dryer,Best hair dryer I have ever owned. Does not dry out or damage your hair. Quieter than most. Dries much quicker.
3,Professional Quality,"I have Three Chi Rocket dryers at my Salon, they are good in performance but short in life of use by electrical problem at switches and power cord. The first one bought at Amstrong McCall were exchanged two times with the same problem at the power cord. The second and third bought through Amazone.com had problem at the ON/OFF switch and sent back for exchange. Overall, they are good in performance but bad in life of use.Good: Fast drying hair, Good price, Sleek-look designBad: Hot and burn at ON/OFF Switch"
1,"Poor Quality, Basic functions, High price","I purchased this dryer to replace a Fhi dryer that had lasted me a good while and was hoping for a good replacement. This was not to be, I was at first disapointed with the minimal control over the heat and blower settings but it did not really end up mattering as the thing totally died within two weeks, thank God Amazon took it back and I did not have to deal with the horrible warrenty. What a waste."
4,Great fast and quiet blow dryer,"It's fabulous. I use it everyday and everyday I am pleasantly surprised at the speed, gentleness, and quietly way this dryer is. I get so many compliments on my hair. I also use the Chi curling iron."
1,Didn't work,"It arrived, I plugged it in....there was a flash, spark...dead. I had already thrown the box away, my mistake. I will say this is my second CHI dryer from Folica...so odds are 50/50 in my scenario about getting a bad one."
1,Broken within a year,"i took a chance and bought a CHI dryer in july 2008 and it's broken just a little over 8 months later. for a $120+ hair dryer to break within a year, that's poor quality workmanship. it was never dropped, exposed to water, or mistreated in any way. for what it's worth, i wouldn't recommend buying any CHI product to anyone- my CHI flat iron also broke within a year from the date of purchase. what's funny-- if you read the warning labels on the CHI products, the english is very broken. for example, the warning on my dryer read ""push reset button if not turn on."" it begs the question of where are these made and with what quality of products?"
4,WARNING RE: One (1) Year Guarantee/Warranty,"I purchased this hair dryer as a Christmas present for my wife. So far, she is happy with it and says that it works good. But I noticed some language in the Owner's Manual that I wanted to warn everyone about. On the last page at the end of the ""Service"" section (which is separate from the ""Guarantee"" section), the following language appears:""The appliance is only under warranty if purchased from a professional salon. The purchase of the appliance will not be guaranteed if purchased through any other outlet including the internet.""So be forewarned that if you purchase this product via the internet, the one year warranty will not apply."
3,High EMF,"I purchased this dryer solely because it was touted as being low EMF. It maxes out the TriField meter (which measures EMF) at the plug as well as at the appliance itself. It dries hair very nicely - so does the dryer I bought at Walmart, which by the way has a lower EMF reading on the meter.I bought =the TriField Meter to test the EMF in our home and found it where I didn't expect it!! Clock Radio, cordless satellite phone, hair dryer, dimmer switch for light over kitchen table - all off the charts.BEWARE if you are purchasing this primarily for LOW EMF - it doesn't deliver."
5,Love this Chi Rocket,"This is the best blowdryer I have ever purchased. Usually I research items online before I go buy an item like this, but I was in desperate need - I went to the closest salon to see what dryers they were selling and they had this one only. She said all her customers love it, I can see why. It is easy to operate, so much quieter than my old dryer, and dries my hair quickly w/o it getting too dry and overblown. I am now going to check out the other Chi products, too."
4,Very Hands-On,"Writing for TV- or film, for that matter- is a challenge. ""Gardner's Guide to Television Scriptwriting-The Writer's Road Map"" will help you get that TV episode, even that pilot episode written. And you don't have to have connections in the (entertainment) business to write a pilot (but if it does get accepted, you DO have to move to LA). Very interactive, and informative.I would have preferred that the author updated this edition, every 2-3 years or so would be fine. As always, TV series come and go, given the volatile nature of (both broadcast and cable/satelite) network TV. But all in all, this is a very good read, and a very good aid to writing for series TV."
2,Strains at the roadmap analogy,"I'm sure there is a great deal of useful information in this book but honestly, it strains so hard to force that information into the roadmap analogy that after a couple of chapters I lost heart. The content is chopped into cute little categories of blocks and streets and signs and rocks and . . . it just gets ridiculous. Personally, I don't want to be amused by the author/editor's cutesy cleverness; I just want to know how to write a television script. There are other books out there that give you the info without making you wade through such a bunch of BS."
4,Ernest Hardy is the the real Notorious F.A.G,"That is to say, Free-thinking, Artistic & Gifted with the ability to see nuances that escape most of us. There are few pop culture scribes with bigger nuts. A real Negro with unapologetically low-hanging cojones. Here's to EH's especially funky macadamndamias, almonds, cashews AND pistachios, all of which have much flavor."
4,Keepin' It Real,"Mr. Hardy has the ability of constantly enrolling you in his perspective with a ""yeah, I see what you mean"" type of response. He is constantly opening new doors of insight without making you feel stupid or less than. I have found some great wit and sarcasm as he keeps it real. Never loosing his ""street cred"", he writes with a great familiarity for any audience. i gained an appreciation for some of the people he interviewed although I didn't like them before. I see them in a different light now."
1,The scratches and pops and skips before Christmas.,"The condition of the master must have been truly pitiful, if they even had the original recording available when they recorded this CD. The quality of this recording is disgraceful. There isn't a selection on this CD that isn't compromised by skips, popping, wobbles, and scratches (on a CD?). Worst $15-bucks I have ever spent. What a waste of wonderful music."
1,Cold Advice,"I actually threw this book out after reading it, which is rare for me. I just thought a lot of the advice, such as how to handle old friends and family, seemed a bit cold-hearted. I understand that a person has to look out for herself, but a lot of the advice in this book seemed quite selfish. I would not recommend wasting your time with this book and figure out what's best for you on your own."
4,Sandy Vong,"I really like this book. I read this book more than 3 times and each time I read it, I get something different out of it. My first time reading this book, I thought there is just a lot of common senses. Then I read it again when I moved out and discover more to this book, whenever I get lost, this book reminds me that it is all about life's ups and downs. I can't wait for her next book to come out."
4,"Fun, but not what I expected","I liked this book... There is insightful information on finding a job. It made me feel better when I had a hard time finding a job. But some of it got a little blah. I found myself skipping pages out of boredom, which is never a good sign. Sadly, Bourland spends a majority of the book on dating. This is what I ended up skipping a lot of. That said, there are definitely parts that I am sure I will go back and re-read whenever I'm down.Recommended for those who are recent graduates without a job and/or boyfriend!"
4,Thought Provoking!,"This book has inspired a great many conversations with friends and with my husband. Although I did skip the chapters on dating I found the rest of the book to be quite informative. The section on careers is really great, it gives you the sense that your feelings are not unjustified but also lets you know that everyone goes through this stage. I found the section on relationships with friends, parents, and sibilings to be especially helpful in identifying some of the issues that we are currently dealing with. And the chapter on Body Image is an absolute must to read for everyone!"
2,"Helpful info,but...","This book had some great tips in it on jobs, health, and finances. But it was really written for a single woman, who lives in a large city some distance from their parents. There was little to no mention of marriage. The financial suggestions are good for someone in the city, but not a smaller town. Plus, not everyone travels a great distance to see their old friends or parents. I didn't think she had any really info for dealing in that situation. I think she wrote this baseing it on her experience. She could have made it more universal - informative to women who are living in other situations."
2,Merely ok,"I thought this book could have been much better. The chapters on dating and jobs are helpful. However, I just can't seem to get past the chapters on body image...To me it felt like the author was trying to say, ""your gonna get fatter as you get older so you can better accept it now. You'll be even more fatter if you have children, so the sooner you accept this the better"" Excuse me, but this is supposed to make me feel better about my body?Maybe it would come across better if she said something along the lines of ""You may find your metabolism slowing down, but thats nothing a little exercise and eating right can't fix"".I am almost willing to put money on the fact that the author is overweight cause this comes through very much in her writing.That alone just made the book a rotten deal for me.Some parts of the book rang true for me, like examples of how your mind changes as you age. But i really don't think there is much advice worth paying for."
4,The title is not a great one...,"If I was the author of this book, I would change the title. It is boring and a little cliche. But, the book itself is a great tool if you have questions about your life in the twenties. I gave the book to two of my friends and they love to read it on the beach and especially if they just got into a fight with their boyfriends and need a little reassurance. Good book, dumb title!"
1,Dangerous advice puts young women's health at risk,"This book missed a great opportunity to educate young women about the health risks involved in being sexually active. The author advises living together before marriage but devotes only a few woefully inadequate paragraphs to educating young women about protection from sexually transmitted diseases. Worse yet, the information provided is dangerously incomplete and incorrect, putting the health of young women readers at risk. This book fails to give young women the tools they need to be proactive in protecting their health above all else. Surviving your twenties SAFELY is more critical than surviving your twenties with style."
3,Fun reading from a real 20-something gril!,"I readily enjoyed the authors personal life in her 20's timeline. The book is broken down into chapters that are all important for the 20-something girl. I felt that she included all the goods and tapped on all the issues, but I felt a little unfufilled in the end. Maybe the author wants us to seek out the answers to all of our questions and troubles further; I thought buying this book was doing that. Maybe it helped the everyday, normal life 20-something. But I just felt like I didn't get all the help and answers I was hoping for. Still, it's not a complete waste. It's light therapy without the doctors bill."
4,Keep Highligher Handy!,"After reading the introduction, I decided that I'd better keep a highlighter handy. The book is chock full of advice on how to handle your twenties healthily and with a sense of humor. I LOVE IT and I'm not even done!"
4,You're not alone,"This is a great book for women in their 20s--as we go through life changes, hormonal changes, and the like, it's comforting to read a book like this, which explains all these changes and reminds us that we're not alone in experiencing it all. It is full of great advice in all areas of your life and is a candid, refreshing read. My only problem is the design--it is extremely text heavy with very few graphics or artistic elements to break it up. I guess there was just too much information to fit in the page count!"
3,A bleak Mid-winter,"This CD contains the usual Rutter mix of gorgeous traditional treatments with a few incredibly schlocky arrangements. Fortunately, I can just leave the schlock off my iPod playlist (otherwise I'd return the CD).The real letdown is my own fault: I didn't notice that ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" is the Darke version, not Holst. Ugh. If only the RealAudio samples had stretched one song further down the song list."
4,"Great music, fine performance","Recommended for everyone to have since secularized ""popular"" Christmas music is repeated endlessly from mid November to 25 December with dreary lyrics and superficial performance. Carols of the Nativity is immensely better."
5,What Christmas should sound like,This is my favorite Christmas album. It is soft and exquisitely beautiful.It evokes all of the peace one feels on a cold Christmas Eve night with the stars shining and the noise and bustle all quieted. The songs are timeless and exquisitely sung. Particulary if you prefer Christmas to be a religious holiday with traditions you should enjoy this CD. My family do not think it is Christmas without hearing as we travel to/from church on Christmas Eve.
4,New Zealand's greatest composer,"Though he studied with Vaughan Williams at the Royal College of Music in 1939, Lilburn's greatest influence is the music of Sibelius. His greatest piece is his Symphony No. 2. The first selection on the disc ""Festive Overture,"" has echoes of his second symphony. His music is joyous in atmosphere, and his gestures can be very dramatic. His ""Suite for Orchestra"" is in the same vein as the string music of Vaughan Williams, Ireland and Howells. Excellent Performances and sonics this is one composer that you should'nt miss. He's one of my favorites."
3,Great book but old,"Stock Car Encyclopedia from 1996: I thought it was a great NASCAR book about statistics and results but it's the same of NASCAR Encyclopedia from 2002, already brough by me...the only difference? obviusly just less updated."
3,Very limited manual,"In this day and age, most aircooled vee dubs need more than a coat of wax, an oil change, and a brake job. This book covers the very limited number of details regarding the issues with the early transporter, non-the-less its got some specs and other details that may come in handy when you need them."
3,Great for 10 years ago,"This is adequate for a beginners setup. Can't help but feel that this would have been a better fit if my home theater were 10 years old. It does help for the general settings, but not really for newer HDTV's."
4,What you would expect,"Good toothbrush. The same thing that a lot of dentists give out. I am a grad student that bikes everywhere, so it was convenient for me to order this online. Getting 6 was nice so that I could replace my old one at home, leave one at school, and leave another at work. Now I have 3 extra when I need them. As unimportant as it is, the only drawback is that I didn't know what colors I would get. It's a 5 star product, but a 4 star process through Amazon I suppose. I mean seriously, what guy isn't dying to have three pink toothbrushes?"
3,Correct Item?,"I don't think this item title and item pictured are the right match. ...same with another Oral B toothbrush here on Amazon.Advantage Plus and Advantage Complete, I think, are different."
5,Great for Manual Toothbrush,"For a manual toothbrush, you can't beat Oral-B Complete Advantage. It just feels like it does a great cleaning job and ""feels"" good on teeth and gums. I use it as a supplement to my electric--which can't be beat. But if you are in a rush or traveling, I hightly recommend this brush."
2,toothbrush,"It was not the one I requested. But I kept them anyway. Appearently Oral B has discontinued its crossaction brushes. I cannot locate them anywhere. The tooth brushes are not the ones pictured. The retailer needs to change its picture, since that is what I went by to to purchase this item."
3,Oral-B Complete Advantage Toothbrush,Purchased for the value pack. Good for a tight budget. The brush head is a bit small or maybe I just have a big mouth.
3,Had a mix up,"I received the wrong product, and I am not sure who goofed. The best part of the transaction was that the vendor took the wrong brushes back and gave me a credit."
4,Can't find it my stores anymore :(,"Well, I LOVE the scent. It's very similar to an Oscar De La Renta powder puff my mom use to have and I don't find it over-powering. It IS very moisturizing, too. Looks like none of my local stores are carrying it anymore, so God bless the digital age."
3,"Like the Product, Hate the Scent","I tried the Cashmere Luxury scent of Caress body wash on a whim. I found the scent to be quite grandmotherly. It is definately old-fashioned and I much prefer the other scents. Still, I love Caress body wash. It is moisturizing and yields impressive, silky lather."
3,"Loud, effective, but pass.","As the description from Amazon says, this unit is rated at 21 db--a nice whisper. That may have been true when new, but after two years and multiple cleanings an airplane flight seems more tolerable. It's now so loud that my built-in Harmon Kardon laptop speakers can't even drown it out. The small fans do an excellent job at keeping the laptop cool, but their small size means they must spin faster to match the airflow of newer units with larger and lower RPM fans. As a bonus, other units include a USB hub for the same price or slightly more."
3,Dented,"I don't know if this effects the performance, but I one of the filters I received was dented on the side. It's not actually a pack of two, there were two individual filters sent. The box that the filters and motor oil was sent it was flimsy, which is not usually the case with Amazon, so maybe this will be an isolated incident."
5,viva Panasonic!,"I used Braun Flex Integra for about 5 years, until the capacity of the battery started decreasing, and I decided that its time to get a new shaver. I followed positive recommmendations on Amazon and bought Panasonic 8066. I must say that I was greatly impressed - no, wrong word - shocked by the difference! Not only it shaves much faster, the closeness of the shave is amazing. Panasonic feels in comparison with my old Braun like a state-of-the-art technology against a stone age device. With Braun, I was always slightly undershaved, it could not get even close to the performance of a traditional razor. A one minute shave with the Panasonic brought my face to the state which I could only dream about in the last five years. Most amazingly, 9 hours after the shave I was still shaved cleaner than what I got used to end up after a shave with Braun! What can I say - viva Panasonic, and thanks to those Amazon reviewers who suggested that this shaver is the best you can get!"
1,How Sad Can Your Life Be?,"Let's get right to the point with this insipid example of cinema sewage - is it worth having your intelligence insulted every few seconds just to get to see a few naked breasts??? If the answer is 'yes', then go for it - you have my deepest sympathies for being so challenged. If the answer is 'no', then cease reading now and find something worthy of your time and cash. If 'American Pie' is the watermark used by the other reviewers to give this swill glowing praise, say no more - it's time to tape the windows and doors, turn the gas on and inhale deeply, hoping your luck is much better in the afterlife than it was here..."
5,Rutter and the Cambridge Singers at their best.,I discovered John Rutter and the Cambridge Singers ten years ago and can't imagine the holidays without them. Christmas Day in the Morning is my favorite. The variety of literature and the flow of the listing makes it perfect for repeat listening. Enjoy!
5,Top 10 Christmas Album,"Any true lover and connoisseur of Christmas music would put this in their ""Top 10"" of Christmas recordings. Why? Few modern Christmas recordings genuinely revere the Birth Of Christ. John Rutter literally worships at the feet of the Christ Child. Rutter offers 23 choral selections, most his compositions, others of European tradition, that imbue the rootedness and wonderous awe that is the spirit and 'magic' of Christmas.Noteworthy are 'Mary's Lullaby,' a Rutter original and 'Fantasia on Christmas carols,' the 1912 compilation by R. Vaughan Williams that balances a baritone soloist against the choral discipline of the Cambridge Singers to invoke several spine-tingling and misty-eyed moments.A Masterwork among Chrismas recordings."
2,Corners break,Well I love the cover !! Love the snapless !! BUT..................I bought this last year and already two of the corners have broke that hold the rail together. I have contacted support will see if they replace them. I will follow up on here when I get an answer
1,Wrong Size,"According to this site, this should fit my 5 1/2ft truck bed. But, when the product got to me and i start installing it, I realize that it's too long. I emailed Lund and they informed me that for my truck bed I need part number 99072. I'm highly upset by this and I won't order anything for my truck from here again so I won't get burned like this again."
1,Unreasonable Shipping Cost,"I have not bought this exact product but needed a new one for my 30-year old blender. I figured amazon.com could come to the rescue but since they don't sell it themselves and bundle shipping costs, this 3rd party supplier seems to charge about $6 shipping / handling per gasket which doesn't make much sense and so I wanted to post this review as a warning. I almost had bought the washers with a bundle of other things before I noticed the extra shipping and handling fees and stopped myself short."
2,Did not fit my Waring blender,"If it does not fit all Waring blenders, please make it clear which it does/does not. I have a popular model but the ring was too large for it.It seems pretty sturdy, which would have been nice if it had fit."
1,Bad Description Wrong Size,"They listed dozens of Waring blender models, but mine was not listed among them, so I took the next closest one. But the gasket I received is completely the wrong size. Perhaps I share some of the blame, but this is not my business. What am I going to do now? Mail it back? It's a $4 part."
2,O ring gasket seal for Waring blender,The O ring was too large....No way to cut down to fit.Darn.... I wish I had a choice of sizes . Any ideas ?
2,Mediocre episode . . .,"When this TV series keeps the action where it should be, i.e. on the Destiny, and in space it is a 4 or 5 star showUnfortunately, this episode spent half the time on earth showing the domestic issues that a couple people had."
1,Disappointment,Terrible show. There is a reason they were not allowed to wear any official USAF insignias. Everyone on the ship was whiny and had teenage angst. Should have never been made.
1,DON'T BUY THIS TITLE UNTIL FIXED!,"Rated 1 star because of screw-up with file NOT as critique of series or episode see below:Bought the last episode to watch and - guess what - no dialog audio, just music and sound effects. The actors can be seen speaking but no dialog can be heard. All other episodes play normally. Nice way to end 2 seasons worth of story. Amazon-Don't you CRC the the files you sell as a QC measure??Amazon - what's with you lately anyway..."
5,It's the story,With SG-1 and SG Atlantis seasons over we can't wait for the next release of each SGU Season 2 episode. The characters are not my favorite but the story keeps us coming back for more as the crew discovers Destiny's secrets. One of our favorite shows.
5,Great SciFi I thoroughly enjoyed.,Loved the entire season so far. Have watched it twice and can't wait for part 2! Hope it gets a third and more seasons to tell all these awesome stories. Favourite episodes of Season 2 have been; Awakening; The Greater Good; Malice; and Resurgence.
4,The story arc develops,"Too sad they cancelled the series after this season. In season 2, the characters had developed pretty well and I had started liking Wray unlike her previous attempts of taking over the ship forcefully. The ending was sad, really sad! This series should be given more time to develop just like Atlantis. Atlantis first season was YAWN!. Season two of SGA was better, but it took them 5 seasons to become really interesting."
5,Great Series but Amazon lousy with a timely download,As much as I love this series the buyer should be aware that Amazon is slow in downloading the videos where you buy a season pass. If you want it fast you should choose ITunes. They are quicker.
4,Wonderful Story but to What End???,"This book is an entertaining ""mystery novel"" that had me riveted to the story until towards the end when all of the sudden it left me a bit adrift. As with any good mystery---I want answers! But I am not going to get them because one must remember this story is a very personal account from someone's real life experience, and in that vein, it is the author's prerogative to figure out what the experience is all about and come up with only the answers she wants. That is why I give the book 4 stars. Her fundamentalist Christian background got in the way of what she gained out of the experience. For instance, why not want to know how Francine died? I'll leave it at that. It is a good read and the facts are well documented but to what end???"
5,Sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction,"Angela's story of her ventures into the realm of reincarnation is not uncommon from those of many people in the present day World. What is different is that she put her story in book form for everyone to see. The book is very well written and I admire her bravery in telling her story. I love her sense of humor, her honesty and integrity. Plus, she is a southern girl that can whip up a batch of biscuits from scratch at the drop of a hat. I must admit, by then end of the book I had a bit of a crush on her."
5,Great Gift,"My grandson is fascinated by polar bears, and wears this shirt whenever it is clean! The colors are vibrant, and the shirt is well made to survive repeat washings."
5,THE source for minimal pairs,This book is THE source for the minimal pairs which can make for effective ESL or EFL pronunciation practice. A CLASSIC in the field.
3,Charles Dickens,"I paid $20.00 for this nutcracker and was very happy with it at this price, I am not sure that I would be willing to pay much more than that though. Collectors may feel differently."
3,Cheese Please,"If you are looking for pure cheese, look no further. I bought this film a number of years ago on VHS when it came out. Dull plot lines and bad acting pervade this story about a father driving his family around on vacation when they encounter teenagers driving around in their fancy hot rods. One of them was a 1962 Corvette, I think. The old man was such a fuddy duddy that he even blurted out that driving ""55 mph"" was ""fast enough."" This was 7 years before the 55 mph speed limit. As for the rest of the film, I liked the drunk old man who drove a little recklessly exclaiming ""those 30 mile zones are muuuurder."" I'm not sure if this DVD is worth buying, although it is in my cart. We'll see"
2,Hot Rods to Hell,"If your a car nut you will enjoy, I remember watching this tv movie when I was a kid. I thought it was scary but a good movie back in the early 60's. It is corny now, but I hadn't seen it in about 44 years."
3,Hotrods to hell,"Kind of a corny old movie, but fun. All kinds of hotrods and I like hotrods. Ive got two tbuckets , myself!"
1,Hard to believe Dana Andrews sank this low...,"Dana Andrews made his mark in 1940s classics like ""Laura"" and ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Two decades later, he was struggling to keep his career alive in low-end ""B"" movies like ""Hot Rods to Hell."" Frankly, this movie gives the ""B"" label a bad name, because ""Hot Rods to Hell"" just plain old-fashioned sucks. The plot is thin, the acting is wooden and the direction and pacing are rock-bottom. At 100 minutes, the movie is at least 10-15 minutes too long. Even worse, it's almost like watching an MGM-produced social engineering movie about youth gone bad and the dangers of driving recklessly.If you're into camp, you'll probably enjoy ""Hot Rods to Hell"" on some level. For every other movie viewer, it's a 100-minute sentence in hell."
1,Adults acting childish,"Here is Dana Andrews in probably the worst role of his career. In ""Hot Rods to Hell"", he plays a moron who gets all huffy about some kids who got a little carried away while having fun. He then proceeds to do his best to annoy them until the confrontation escalates to tragic consequences. Yet somehow the director apparently doesn't think it is his fault.Excuse me. What part of ""ignore them and they'll get bored and go away"" did he not understand? This movie makes adults look like idiots. No wonder the 60's turned out the way they did. <Sardonic grin>This film barely managed four stars out of ten at IMDB - just slightly better than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". I guess I'm not the only one who disliked it.Why did they waste resources and the plastic to put this tripe out on DVD when there are so many other excellent films they still haven't released? How about a Dana Andrews classic like ""While the City Sleeps""? Oh well."
3,Not Bad!,"Nice looking Hot Rods! The movie had a good plot. Not a great movie, but worth adding to the collection."
4,Hot Rods To Hell (DVD),"The first time I saw this movie was on the TNT channel back in the early1990's. I'm happy that it's now on DVD. I like these ""old school"" teenager flicks!"
3,Sanitized Version Not Wanted!,"I saw this movie on TV in the mid/late 60's and can't believe that they edited out the single greatest line of the entire movie! Inside the Arena Duke finally has another shot at Tina on the dance floor. The band is playing a slow, steamy number and the two of them are getting into it! Duke, in his sexiest voice possible, slowly begs Tina to ""Turn on, Baby!"" My friends and I went wild laughing till it absolutely hurt! Funniest line ever, never to be forgotten. Imagine my utter disappointment when this movie finally gets released on DVD and they edit the line out! Just like TNT did when they aired it a few years ago. Can't believe they need to protect our ears from the horrible druggie language of the time. Very disappointing! All of you should be able to hear it. It was GREAT! Does anyone else remember hearing those three immortal words, or are my friends who were there with me the only ones to remember the line of a lifetime?"
5,Amazing Product!,"My boyfriend purchased this item under my account a few weeks ago. He loves these boots to say the least! He had his other boots for years and he's really picky about what boots he buys. These boots offer everything he wanted, durability and sharp appearance. He says they are very comfortable too. I think i can speak for him when i say he would most definitely recommend this product!"
3,interesting price tag,"I just got the beach towel and it seems pretty good, just a lil thin. However, I noticed the price tag says retail 14.99, but the amazon list price is 30... very interesting"
3,Great product,This word great when you have a lit of spindles and hand rails to stain. The only con is it leaves quite a bit of fuzz behind. Helps cut time in 1/2 though!
1,Malfunctioning Product,"This was potentially a really neat buy. Unfortunately, when I first tried the product, it began to smoke and a very unattractive smell (burning plastic) wafted out of the straightener. I have written Revlon and asked for a replacement, however they have not sent a new product or replied at all. Now that I've been waiting a month, I hope they get to my letter and send me a replacement or I'll have to call and request one. I think that this straightener would have been great if it had actually worked...but it unfortunately malfunctioned."
2,Atrocious!,"As a person with social anxiety, I watched this movie because I could possibly relate to it and enjoy it. However, the social anxiety portrayed here in ""Nerve"" is completely unrealistic and unremarkable. The main character's anxiety levels fluctuate between psycho and barely anxious. His ""treatment"" for social anxiety is also a little unbelievable and makes it seem as though getting through this mental disorder is a cake walk for anyone. The editing in this movie is not so good as well. The film keeps jumping around and leaves the viewer disoriented and confused as to when, where, and what events are happening. However, on a positive note, the actors did a very well job considering the poor writing. The actor that plays as Josh felt alive, vivid, and generally played his part pretty well. Overall, a great idea for a film done rather poorly. Would not recommend."
1,Junk!,"Never worked properly, poor documentation, unreliable.Wish it had, it would have helped greatly in my project."
2,Reading with Tequila,"The Year of the Intern reads like a non-fiction memoir-like account of a medical intern. It focuses on the dull, day to day life of an intern that we've all seen countless times on medical television shows like ER. Robin Cook fans are used to his fast-paced thrillers and this early book is nothing like his more recent novels.The Year of the Intern looks at the stressful and exhausting job a surgical intern has. The book focuses on Dr. Peters' fear and his grief at the loss of patients. It's disconcerting reading about a doctor unsure of himself as we usually like to believe that doctors are strong and have all the answers.The bottom line is the book just wasn't that interesting. It kind of got under my skin, making me fear being left in the hands of an intern at the hospital, but the actual story in the book left me wanting more. If you're looking for suspenseful, medical thrillers, skip this one and stick with Robin Cooks later books."
2,YEAR OF THE INTERN,This was obviously one of his first books and did not have the finesse and intrigue of his later books.
4,Robin Cook Book,"Another great book by Robin Cook!Yes,it was written several years ago, but Robin Cook had written just as awesome back then as he does now! I highly recomend this read.Ordered through Amazon and was extremely happy with the prompt delivery as usual."
2,Difficult to read at times.,"The Year of the Intern is not a good book. If your wanting a good medical thriller to read, this is not the Robin Cook book for you. Though fiction, it reads as non-fiction as Cook takes us into the life of a medical student's internship in Hawaii. I struggled, at times, to understand the medical jargon which took away from any enjoyment I might have been getting from reading the book."
4,IT'S GOOD FOR STUDENTS,"This book is excellent for students who are looking to become doctors. I don't feel that this book is like a thriller. It is in some ways, but it really dosen't have a story.It's good to read to find out what is going on behind the scenes."
4,Intriguing and disturbing. . .,"The Year Of The Intern chronicles the year a young doctor spends as an intern. Along with lots of fascinating medical detail, the book takes a searingly honest look at the physical and psychological cost to the intern. These include: the near-indescribable exhaustion, the expectation of carrying out complicated and risky procedures the intern does not have the experience for, the life-or-death decisions to be made daily, dealing with anxious, angry and distraught relatives and, worst of all, the gradual ebbing of empathy eg Dr Peters starts thinking of each patient by their disease rather than their name.What really disturbed me was the fact that this was written in 1972 and so little has really changed. This should be compulsory reading for anyone thinking of entering the medical or nursing professions. If it doesn't put you off, you've found your calling!"
5,Insight into the mind of an Intern,"This is a great book. Whether you like Robin Cook or not you should give this book a read. His first novel and very different to his thrillers, this book follows the journey of an intern's mind through his year placement. It will certainly give people a different perspective of the medical world. The book was written in the 70's but somehow (sadly) I don't think the life of a fledging doctor has changed to this day..."
5,One of the Best Educational Software made for HS!!!!!,"Wow, after using the Math CD's including in this product, I enjoy using it so much. I like the interactive math lectures and quizzes. They also have online links. I found so much useful information that will help me with my High School work. I totally recommend this product to all students and teachers. I give it 5 out of 5 stars."
2,HS Advantage 2002 lacks cohesive planning,"The individual products are generally good and learner friendly. However, each title appears to be programmed by a different ""team"" who thought their computer settings should be yours as well. This means: I had to change screen color characteristics (16 colors, 256 colors, etc.) using Win 98SE and even load an alternate driver for the video card before one program would run.This was an incredible hassle to set up before it could be used and then reset to do anything else or run another title from the same publisher. It would be nice if those who bundle this software actually sat down with an entire set of disks and tried to use each one--it could lead to consistency of performance. Imagine that!If you don't mind ""adjusting"" your computer, these programs are generally well thought out and progress the student appropriately. Myself, I'll look for a more considerate package that allows kids to pop a disk in and learn."
2,High School advantage- disappointing,"We homeschool our children and have enjoyed past 'Advantage' titles, and so were disappointed with this one. The three math programs; Algerbra, Geometry and Trigonometry were good, but duplicated ""Math Advantage"". The others were old, poor, and dry as dust."
4,Very Satisfactory...But I Want More Inserts!,Durable plastic. I dont see it breaking anytime soon. I use it for locksmithing parts and I am pleased with the sizes of compartments I can make and the ease of sliding them out on the rounded partitions. I have a lot of weight so one draw back is the lack of comfort of the handle but atleast it is solid. My other complaint is the lack of enough inserts to do the job. I have many small parts and they do not include enough inserts to make sufficient number of compartments.+++Durable++Clear View of Parts+Solid clasps. Better than most.---Not enough inserts for me--Handle uncomfortable when weighted downHighly recommend.
4,good product,This is a replacement for one we had previously. We have had this for work for many years. it has lots of drawers and fits most things compact enough to take with you out of the office.
2,Not What I expected,"I purchased this album on the thought the songs were all original recordings. These were recorded later in her life and have a different tone and speed. The music that accompanied her singing is as another reviewed stated 'like elevator music'. I probably would not have purchased this recording. The songs simply do not have the feel that I remembered from my early days. It is almost modern in style. Still a great voice, though."
2,pastiche,"A great artist of the folk music era of the '60s and '70s has re-issued her greatest songs with lame orchestrations. I bought this CD thinking these were the original versions on CD - they are not. I will have to listen to my old vinyl or buy CDs that are re-issues on the original vinyl.Great artists should care more for their legacy. She obviously did this recording for the money, I hope she was paid."
1,Wrong Item,"I ordered an Oklahoma State University divot tool. I was sent a University of Oklahoma divot tool. One of my school's biggest rivalry's. Obviously I am not pleased. The tool itself is awesome, but sadly the ball marker is officially useless to me when it says OU on it."
4,Awesome,"I love this band and this album is no disappointment. The music is powerful and the lyrics are striking. Ohne Dich is by far my favorite. It is beautiful and emotional. The lead singer's voice is deep and melodic. I love their first album, Eisbrecher, and Antikoper is even better."
4,more metal,"Another great album from Eisbrecher, this one contains alot more guitar work than the last. The heavy industrial feel is still present, although minimal electronics can be heard."
4,Fanfrickentastic!,"I invite anyone who likes Rammstein, or any kind of German Industrial Metal, to check this band out! They're fricken awesome! :) Very raw sound! Something to bang your head to!"
4,Good C.D.,"I really like this cd. It is certainly better than the first, and the first is very good. I would certainly recommend it to fans of Rammstein, industrial, or techno. It is slightly lighter than Rammstein, with a more electronic techno sound. Some songs have a classic rock ballad feel (Ohne dich), while others are raw aggression (Antikorper). The lead singer (Alexx Voxx) was formally of Megaherz, so you might find a similarity there in the sound of the band. But in my opinion Eisbrecher has its own original sound. You can listen to a few full songs at the Eisbrecher my space profile for free. [...]"
5,YAY!,"I've been eagerly awaiting this album since I discovered the last one about two years back.I have never been a megaherz fan, I tend to lean more towards Rammstein, Tanzwut, and KMFDM. This album is harder than the last, which I find delightful. I love my music crunch with milk.I've spun it 4 times in the last 3 days, and I find I simply like it more and more. If you love German industrial, this is a must-have."
3,Good product,"I got this product for a friend and he loved it! The scarf is long, I would have preferred it to be thicker however for the price it was good. The stitching is good in detail but the edges are more frayed than I would have liked. Overall it was worth the buy."
4,Great for tummy time,My daughter could only do a little more than a minute on her tummy before she would start crying. Now she can do about five minutes. She really enjoys the faces! My only complaint is that it is not machine washable and my daughter tends to spit up when she's on her belly.
1,Unable to see mirror,Baby is unable to see mirror when on tummy propped by own arms or using pillow. The product would be better if the mirror was higher or if the mirror was at a better angle.
2,Poor binding,Though the content is good and easy to use and refer to. The binding of this book broke quite fast and the insides are nearly out of the book. We buy many books and handle them fairly well. It is very possible this was just a bad copy?
1,It's is really bad.,"It happen to me too. I order it and I thought that it will come with six oral-b ultra floss, but it only comes with one. Buyer beaware. ..."
1,Misleading,"I assumed that the prefix 6 meant that you were getting 6 55-yard spools. Wrong, I got one at $17.S. Robinson"
1,Still trying to get my 6 packs of floss,"I returned my one package of floss ages ago requesting all six. The package came last night (5/9/06). One package of floss, not six. I'm returning again and requesting a refund. I will purchase in the future from someone who can count."
4,Blackwater Swamp,"BLACK WATER SWAMPBY: BILL WALLACEThis book is about a young boy named Ted. He recently moved to Louisiana. He lives with his Mother, Father, and baby sister Christine. He always thought that the witch of Black water swamp was a legend, but soon he'll find out its not. There have been a series of robberies in the small town in which Ted lives.I liked this book because it is a good mystery. The way the writer writes makes this book hard to put down. The author uses good descriptive details. This book is for younger audiences, maybe fourth through six grade.By: John Kennedy"
4,The Way of the West,This movie is slow moving but the performances from the actors are all standouts. The storyline is easy to follw..those who enjoy Westerns will like this one.
4,Nice Relaxing Accoustic Latin music,"If you enjoy Ottmar Liebert, Jesse Cook, and similar Latin guitarists you will enjoy this CD. Technically excellent and artistically beautiful arrangements of an excellent variety of songs including Samba Pa Ti (Santana), To The Night (Liebert), and Take 5. Very nice background music for dinner or a cocktail party as well as general listening."
5,Great Camera,This camera is perfect and exactly what we need for our office. Easy to use and no messy software.
3,"Nice, Average Camera","I bought this camera for my boyfriend for Christmas because it was affordable and it was a Canon! It takes great pics and videos (though I still can't figure out how to add sound). It has a defect though I'm afraid. It won't turn on until we flip the batteries. I'm sure its a minor thing and it really doesn't affect anything. It runs batteries down pretty quickly, but it's small, compact, and takes amazing pics!"
4,nice camera,"Nice camera for the price, although within one week of buying it Circuit City had it cheaper. Anyway, easy to use and fits nicely into a purse. A larger SD card is a must."
1,Ugh!,"I just got this today as a replacement for a kodak I had for several years. This camera is not user friendly. Instead of words for a menu, Canon has decided to put little meaningless pictures on the camera and in the menu. If you just want to take a few pictures and upload it to a few friends without the technobabble or without having to learn an alien picture language - this isn't the camera for you."
3,"Bought this here at Amazon, and returned it after a week","Believe it or not the Canon A430 4MP superfine mode is worse than my old Nikon Coolpix 2500 2MP...Wait at least 5 seconds for the flash between shot, and you know the little ones don't sit still. Kodak moments are gone before the camera cooperated.Color is not quite accurate either...Other than that, has lots of extra features...but that is not the reason I buy a camera.I'm going to give Canon another try with the SD600 model..."
2,Good While it Lasted,Bought this little gem last August for my son's birthday. 13 months later the LED screen is frozen with god knows what on it's screen. Will cost $50 just to open it up. Won't buy Canon again.
4,Great little camera,"I bought this camera for my daughter to travel to Australia with, she had no problems, took great pictures and movie videos. She thought the sound didn't work on the videos, however when you play them back on the camera there is no sound, but once they are downloaded then the sound has great clarity. The menus are very easy to navigate through, great startup time, and buttons on the back are easy to navigate. This will be a great camera to pack anywhere because of its size, and it take great pictures too !!"
3,Good camera for the price,"Good camera for the price I got it for.Pros:-High resolution and quality for its price-Good picture quality even at lower resolutions and extensive other features (flash-type, picture fineness, decent zoom, short video clip feature)-Cheap-Works with Windows, Linux and Mac (then again most USB cameras these days do, but I've known others which have been nightmares)Cons-You have to buy rechargeable batteries or you're not going to go too far with this camera-The included memory card doesn't save too many pictures at higher resolutions-Slow shutter speedI got this about a year ago and it's still in excellent condition. I'm not sure how much the price has gone down but if you want to get a good yet cheap camera, Canon's a good bet."
1,Buyer beware: you get what you pay for,"I got this camera in September 2006, and it died around June 2007 (a useful life of approx. 9 months). Out of the blue one day it said ""low battery"", and would shut off when I tried to take pictures. It was no help to change the batteries. I sent it in for warranty repair, but the factory found a dent in the lense ring (which to my knowledge has no relation to the batteries) and because I had ""damaged"" the camera, they were going to charge me $94.29 to repair the whole thing. After I told them lense repair was not wanted or necessary, they told me any damage anywhere voids the entire warranty. I have heard of similar battery issues from at least one other person. You are better off buying a more expense and better quality camera, rather than buying one of these every nine months."
4,Good book,"This has a good plot line. The main character has my son's name, so we bought the book because of that."
4,Long-lasting,"These replacement foam earpieces are identical to the product included with the earphones themselves. Good noise isolation, although I would not recommend them for ear protection per se."
5,Outstanding,"Ari Brown is an incredibly powerful, soulful player from the rich Chicago tradition of tenor greats. The band is top-notch, the energy is electric. Highly recommended!"
5,ode to joy,"i have a completely new level of understanding regarding this tremendous work of music. i appreciate that the author not only works through the musical elements of the work, but also different music appreciation elements as well; he analyses different critical judgements given about the work. furthermore, the complete poem is translated into english (which i should have expected, but didnt). my favorite line of the book is: ""Only the most cynical of listeners can walk away from a performance of the ninth symphony without sensing that all could be well with the world, if only the world wished it so"" (pp. 8)"
2,disapointed,"I do not like this book because it is written for those that can read music and have at least some understanding of compositional theroy. Mr. Levy's disection of the four movements are very technical, very dry, and not meant for the layman. My 2 stars then are given as a layman. The biggest problem is just over half of the books 226 pages are simply a measure by measure breakdown of each movement. To me it seems like stating the obvious, espically if one can read music. The later chapters do however provide accounts of the first performance and the symphony's legacy. If I had known of the technical aspect of the book I would have passed. I guess the insight into the composer I seek might better be found in a biography."
4,Remastered sound is superb!!!!!!!,"If you're already a Raspberries fan, you know about these four albums, this being the first. The reason to get these new imports is for the beautiful digipak and the vastly improved sound over any of the domestic releases. I have this and 'Fresh' and i'm counting the days til 'Side 3' and 'Starting Over' are available."
2,"Not well written, and limited in research","This book contains what seems like an accurate, detailed fictional portrayal of escape attempts from Libby Prison in Richmond during the Civil War. But the book isn't well written and the main culprit is the dialogue. Every character speaks in ridiculously thick, phonetically spelled dialect. All the Southerners talk in the most stereotypical way imaginable. The author's presentation of the horrors of Libby Prison, while eschewing any discussion of the equally awful conditions faced by Southerners in the North, gives a feeling of unreliability to the novel's status as well-researched historical fiction. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this."
2,Fancy digressions but no core,"The book promises to be right up my alley. It's about lost love, it's set among New York artsy Yuppies, and its narrative is a formal experiment. A broken couple's story, beginning the morning of the new millenium, moves freely in time and point of view, broken by a true almanac of famous dates, to chart as well a parallel love of the man's grandfather regained after decades. Only we never get any clearer sense of what drove any of them together in the first place, apart, or back together. The prose is blandly elegaic, and the digressions, which could have been copied verbatim from an encyclopedia, never convinced me that the events are somehow paradigmatic of history or, conversely, that the historical anecdotes and Y2K shed any light on the couple. So ambitious but forced and numbing."
3,don't expect depth,"The first section start with a quick intro to data modeling and general SQL/Oracle syntax. Mid section's focus is on Java data conduits to Oracle (JDBC, SQLJ, etc.). The last part of the book covers a broad range of technologies from IDEs to enterprise components. If you're a Oracle beginner with some java background this book may be of use. The authors cover the material in short succinct snippets. This also benefits middle tier developers - between beginners and experts. For them, this book can be a very useful reference for frequent lookups."
1,Where is the e-Commerce?,This book spends a lot of time and pages (1200+ pages of nothing) on basic SQL and Java commands. It tries to focus on two types of audience (those with Oracle background and those with Java background) but fails to satisfy either.There is no clear path on e-Commerce development using the discussed techniques and how to really apply the information in a practical manner.I am not sure what the authors were trying to really achieve in all these pages......obviously they were working in isolation (each trying to write for different audience)
2,Only gets 2 stars because of Fahey's mug,"Sigh....I keep hoping, only to be disappointed.Fahey's pants were too baggy. Very un-Fahey.Pretty unrealistic stunts. Unless you like that sort of thing. When a limo hits a semi, it generally comes to a standstill, however the one in this movie took flight. I find that unusual.Once more poorly built characters, not so hot acting, lots of obscenities. All in all, not a plot you can find believable. Since when are former Disco Dudes accomplished blackmailers and bad guys?Come on, Fahey, give me something to work with here!"
4,Pretty good brush,I have sensitive teeth and gums. I am 50 and didn't always take perfect care of my teeth. Luckily they are healthy now but I still need a sensitive brush that will massage and brush my teeth and gums but be gentle. This brush is a soft brush which all people should use but I really do need to be aware of the pressure I am using when brushing with it. My gums don't bleed or anything but sometimes it just feels like the bristles were working a little too hard. I am definitely brushing correctly. I have found that the GUM soft Super Tip brush works better for me but this is my second choice. I believe that if you have taken proper care of your teeth and gums from the get go this brush should be perfect. But if you have sensitive gums it may be a little too harsh. Sadly even though I have corrected the way I care for my teeth and gums the sensitivity caused by years of not cannot be reversed. I do find Oral-B to be a reliable brand and received the 6 brushes as ordered.
5,The best toothbrush ever,"This is the best manual toothbrush I've ever used. I've used Colgate and Crest toothbrushes for ever. Someone gave me one of these on a trip when I forgot my own.Why it's good: Compared to my old toothbrushes this one just has more bristles and covers more space. I checked my last toothbrush (Crest) and this one and this one is about 20% bigger so when I brush it covers more teeth. The grip is OK. I don't really care about the indentations and stripes on the grip, those don't really do anything and could possibly be a space for mold to form, though you should definitely be throwing it away before that happens.Overall, I just like it a lot better. This is the toothbrush I'll get in the future."
1,Amazon can't get it right,"Amazon kept sending me 1 toothbrush instead of 1 pack of 6 toothbrushes. I had placed a few separate orders and they were all wrong. Ending up sending them back for refunds. Satisfied with everything else I've ordered from Amazon, but they can't seem to get a simple toothbrush order correct."
1,Toothbrush Too Small,"I am pretty good at reading descriptions and buying product sight unseen. I made a mistake with this toothbrush. The head of the toothbrush, the bristle, is way too small for me and for my husband. Probably a good toothbrush for kids, young adults and women with small mouths (not many of those in the US but thought I should mention it)."
2,"Bad packaging, bent book",The book arrived completely bent on one of the sides. A real shame as it is a hard copy and very hard to put back into shape.
3,decent,"they are ok. They do the job, but they are a little big and dont allow the neck to fully go back enough for a wash without water getting everywhere."
4,He makes my sun shine...,"Flipping through the channels on TV one afternoon, I came across the video for ""U Make My Sun Shine"" on BET. It was one of those moments when nothing in the world matters except for getting your hands on the song. After a scavenger hunt of trying to find this CD, and hearing various release dates, I found it and was at peace. How can you not love UMMSS? If you like ""Untitled (How does it feel?)"" by D'Angelo, you will like this. It has put me to sleep ever since I've gotten it. Flip side...I am not a big fan of ""When Will We Be Paid?"" Although it may grow on you if you listen to UMMSS as many times as I do, and being that it follows, you may occasionally find yourself humming along, but the lullabye quality that UMMSS has is definitely not present in this funk tune. Overall, the CD brings intrigue and more anticipation for ""The Rainbow Children."""
5,Great listening!,"I love these songs! U Make My Sun Shine is a great R&B song and would definitely have been a huge hit for Prince if he were in his heyday of popularity. It's great hearing Angie Stong on the song. When Will B Paid is the perfect B-Side - raw, emotional with piercing guitars and lyrics. He does wonders with a classic from The Staples Singers."
4,"not WOW, but good","While this single failed to really amaze me, it still was a relaxing experience. It starts off with the balled ""U make my Sunshine"", which is a good song that will hopefully get sufficient airplay. The next song is ""When will we b paid"", which is also a good song and has some nice guitar playing on it. While Prince could have done better, he's getting there."
2,Fairly Average,"nothing really stands to me here.typical Prince over the past Decade Overly Arranged&Performed.also Sunshine reminds me way too much of D'angelo's ""Untitled"" which was a Prince tribute but a throwaway cut nevertheless.""When Will we be paid"" was better done by The Staple Singers.Prince&Cover Songs don't go hand&hand.both songs have moments but nothing here is at His Peak Best.Angie Stone is Neutral neither Adding or Subtracting from Sunshine."
5,Music for Everyone,"I love this CD! So what if they are occasionally a little off-pitch. These two guys know how to sing a love song. The music is fun, the lyrics are funny, and the love songs are obviously from the heart of two guys who - after all these years - are tbig softies when it comes to their ladies. They say it the way it is, through the screaming kids, to the longaberger baskets blues, to buddies hauling off to Vega - a absolute joy and hoot to listen too. What fun!"
4,Easy Install,"About five minutes went by from packaged to installed and running. Installation is super easy and I am experiencing no leaks. The hinge that holds the shower head is not cheap plastic like several popular brands have and it is sturdy. I have yet to change the filter, but from what I have read it is also a simple task.The only downside to this shower head is the relatively thin stream. If they could manufacture one with a wider shower stream, I believe this product would be perfect. Overall, it is definitely worth the purchase."
5,Great Handheld Filtered Showerhead,"We purchased this unit after our original was dropped on the floor and cracked. This unit is much better with a larger head and more settings allowing for almost the rain forest type of shower head. Since the connector the pipehead is flexible it allows you to position the head in any direction. If you are looking for a filtered shower head because of hard water, I strongly suggest researching this unit. It is easy to install and the filters last a long time again dependent on how hard your water is. Good luck."
3,Good product but would be better if point were more tapered,"This product works but can work better.The tip of the product is blunt. I understand why they do it - so you and your kids can't use it like a butcher's hook, slaughter dozens of people, and then sue the manufacturer. I get it.However, it's difficult to get under the lace sometimes. Just taper it a little. It doesn't need to be sharp like a fishing hook, but it doesn't need to be blunt like an infant's toy."
3,Not as Good as Using Hands,"It's hard to rate these things. I've never used boot hooks before and these seen do what they supposed to do well and as expected. However, I found pulling the boots on by hand worked better than using these boot hooks. I have low top harness boots. When I use these hooks to pull on the boot's pull loops the force is too far toward the front of the boot and my heels crush into the back of the boot top rather than sliding into the boot. It's MUCH easier to pull them on by hand. Perhaps if they are used on high top boots they work better."
4,"great work, a small criticism","excellent documentation and sources, footnotes exceptional. A serious scholar, but he could not keep his Christian slant from his interputations, it shows in spots. He also used !!! several times, Very unacceptable for a scholarly work. though they could have been added by editiors.He could have stressed more heavily that the ARK was not a ship or boat, rather a flatbottom, box or barge. Thus down playing the several reports of sighting a prow or deepwater hull.This persistent Christian representation of a huge sea-going vessels aptly illustrates the problems cause by lack of concern of basic accuracy.(not on the author's part however)BUT WORTH READING."
2,"Please buy it, but...","This purchase was for me a gesture of support: whoever you might be, I would urge you as well to buy from out people.That mentioned, I listened to the CD only once and doubt I will again. Why? It's flat out boring. There are no memorable songs; the playing is sloppier than the music demands; the vocals are uninteresting; and the theme of gayness is overworked (just as would be a collection of songs about being straight). The worst aspect is the lyric content: admirable though the sentiments might be, the lyrics are horribly inept, as if the composer were simply counting syllables rather than bothering to make the words actually scan and _be_ lyrics, rather than metered speech.It's a shame, really, that a band that one would _like_ to be worthy is not: buy it and show off the cover, but don't bother opening it."
3,Not a perfect case,I own a Powershot 800. I like the material and the fit. The only thing that irks me is that the small pouch that fits an extra battery or media card doesn't have a zipper or velcro closure. Things slip out pretty easily and you can lose a card or drop a battery (which I did and dented it).
2,Not for the Canon S100,"I bought the case based on the reviews believing it would be ideal for carrying my Canon S100. However, while it's reasonably well padded, it's too small for the camera. Getting the camera in and out takes two hands, one to hold the camera, the other to hold the case. And the cover flap's velcro pad just meets case pad when the accessory pocket is empty. I do not recommend this case for the S100 camera."
5,case for Fuji f31fd camera,"Perfect. Just what I wanted. I use it all the time. Fits the f31fd perfectly. Carries an extra memory card. Protects the camera well. Shoulder strap carry is what I like, but also has a belt carry loop. My quest for the correct case for the f31fd stops here. It's the one."
3,semi OK product,"Product arrived on time. I have been using it for 3 months so far and seems to be OK. Workmanship is poor and had to put silicon all around it since I was worried about moisture getting inside the lens.Buy at your own risk and if you do, make sure to add silicon all around it."
4,Denise Austin Anti-Aging,"The tape does work, but the sound fades in and out.Our other tapes do not have the same problem."
2,idiot,There is alot of usefull info in here but that is over shadowed by the ego trip he's on. He insults your intelligence way to much. He should have hired a writer to make the book less abrasive and should spend less time advertising his products.
2,Too much ego and infomercials,"I got this book based on the lots of good reviews but after some time reading it I was really annoyed by all the ego demonstration and by the informercials.If you could take out the book his ""catalog"" of products and his ""I did this"", ""I created that"" and ""look how brilliant I'm"" things, this book would be less than a half of its size, besides cheaper."
5,A MUST TO ALL ARCHERS,"I AM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE BOOK AND I AM TOTALLY AMAZED AT ON HOW WRONG I HAVE BEEN TAUGHT IN THE PAST ABOUT FORM, SIGHT PICTURE, POINT WEIGHT,. BERNIE EXPLAINES IT ALL SO ALL CAN UNDERSTAND. IT WAS HARD TO FIND THE TIME TO READ THE BOOK BUT ONCE I STARTED IT IS HARD TO PUT IT DOWN. I HAVE WATCHED SO CALLED EXPERTS SHOW AND DEMENSTRATE POOR FORM, WRONG DRAW WIEGHT, SELL WRONG EQUIPEMENT. I NOW HOLD MY BOW LIKE IT IS SECOND NATURE AND IT MAKES THE SPORT SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE. I HAVE HAD A NEW BOW FOR 3 MONTHS AND VOWED NOT TO FIRE IT UNTIL I HAVE READ HIS BOOK. GET THE BOOK THEN BUY YOUR EQUIPMENT. OTHER WISE IT IS LIKE GETTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. GREAT JOB BERNIE, KEEP UP THE FIGHT TO TEACH ARCHERY THE RIGHT WAY"
4,Lots of Songs !,I love this book because it gives lots of good songs and includes a picture of the required chords needed to play the song. I think it is a book every guitar person needs. I am a beginner and it has a variation of songs from easy to difficult.
2,Not what it seems,"I bought this book after looking at the ""look inside"" feature. When it arrived it was lacking many songs from the table of contents I saw from the ""look inside"" feature. The book that Amazon has and the book that is shown are different books with different songs. I would like to hope that someone would correct that."
2,Interesting Song Selection,"First of all, before I say anything about the songs contained within this book, note that 98% of all the songs are in standard notation. I realize that most experienced guitar players this is not an issue but for beginners or those that have been taught to read tablature only this will not do anything for you.Now, as for the selection of music, I have to say that it is an interesting collection and not quite what I thought it would be. It has the Addams Family and Munsters theme songs, Auld Lang Sine, the theme to Mission Impossible, etc... If I wanted to play theme songs, I would download the music off the internet for free (sorry, I have an issue with playing theme songs)."
3,Good song selection.,"Need some expierence to use this book, not desigined for new beginers. Good song selection and fun to work with. Easy to follow and understand."
4,Nice look at champions,"As a fan of stock car racing, I found the inside look at what happens to those winning championships to be interesting and a learning experience. I'd recommend this for fans of any level of stock car racing."
2,slightly disappointed,"I don't usually have to sit and continously inspire my daughter to watch ""learning software"". In fact, she stays up late and I have to tear her away from some programs. Not this one. ADVANTAGE is overly stuffy for some reason, low tech, and dull. Its appropriate for elementary level study, I guess. But my kid is on 'roller-blades', and this thing is on 'skates'."
1,misleading subjects,"Elementary Advantage purports to teach spelling, typing, and grammer. However, these subjects were merely ""see how fast you can complete these answers"" and do not teach a thing. The other ""subjects"" were other company's software (knowledge adventure, etc) that they must have trashed.Not recommended!"
2,dissapointing...,"I have bought Math Advantage 2002 and that was an excellent software package by Encore Education. But the Elementary Advantage 2002 is the biggest disappointment. The grammar, spelling, reading sections teach nothing but are annoying games that do nothing to explain wrong/right answers. I wanted my niece to learn about grammar, spelling, etc., but there are no tutoring sessions or explanations. Very disappointing... considering the price."
2,"Rizen, You're Not Up Yet","Saints and Friends, if you enjoyed their blow-out first album, you're not going to like this CD. This is a dis-jointed, percussion driven, mangled album. Gone are the quartet-like songs only to be replaced but screaming lead vocals competing w/the drums of Sheila E! Who wants to hear that mess? This sophomore try by these ladies leaves a lot to be desired, especially the $16 bucks I used to buy the CD."
3,Gore Feast,"I saw this film in the theater in 1973. It was advertised banned in 36 countries. They handed you a barf bag when you walked in. If the film didnt make you vomit the smell inside the theater would. Watch if if you like this thing. Campy,gross and sexy all at the same time."
3,Re-review of a Good Horror,"I saw this movie back in the 70's and I was around ten years old (not trying to tell my age) I remember oh-so well when I walked in they gave me a barf bag...thinking what did I need this for. Saw alot of torturing scenes, can't wait to view them again as an adult. I will love to Re-review after seeing this movie again. Stand by horror movie lovers."
3,It's okay,I remember this as a kid at the drive-in movie theater but not all the specific content. The audio is substandard but would be fine if you heard it from the one speaker you hang on your side window.
1,Poor excuse of a film,"This is probably one of the most if not the most graphic films I have ever seen. I suppose it was written to shock people into understanding the horror of ignorance and the suffering of all during the middle ages, but it passes the point of being shocking in its portrayals of torture and death. One of the great aspects of the film genre is that we DON'T have to see everything. ""Mark of the Devil"" gives the viewer absolutely no release. The gore and carnage are SO graphic that they make the movie unwatchable. I stopped watching half way through, and I'm one of those people who NEVER stops a movie, no matter how bad. Don't make the same mistake I did by even starting it in the first place!"
2,IT'S NOT LIKE I REMEMBER IT,WAY BACK WHEN THIS MOVIE WAS THE ONE YOU WENT TO WITH YOUR FRIENDS JUST TO SEE IF ANYONE WOULD PUKE. NOW THIS IS THE MOVIE YOU WOULD SEE TO IF IT'S JUST AS YOU REMEMBER IT. IT'S NOT! NOW IT'S A GOOD LAUGH . STICK TO YOUR MEMOREY IT'S BETTER. AND IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT DON'T WORRY YOUR NOT MISSING ANYTHING. I ONLY WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK.
1,chaosprincess,"GET THEM BARF BAGS READY. This is the mother of all gore movies and it will hard to beat in the catogory of GORE.. Night of the Living Dead is a Disney movie compared to this. This is strictly Euro TRASH don't waste time or money not worth the cost of the barf bag either you will need when you see the brutal torture scenes and don't even go there with that tongue being pulled out,,,GROSS"
4,Just as shocking now as it was in the early 70's!,"I saw this movie as a child at the drive-in with some relatives. We were suppose to be seeing a Disney film I can't remember. This film gave me nightmares for years. The torture scenes are shocking to this day, and Reggie Nalder plays as evil a person that has ever been on film. The plot is shallow, but nevertheless, it is horrific. Also, at the drive in, they handed out vomit bags to people when you paid to get in."
3,Love story AND gruesome goosome,"Interesting seeing Udo Kier (Nazi Captain in Raiders of the Lost Ark) in his early days. Rather boring plot that drags among beautiful scenery. Surprising that this film is not rated as there is nudity, torture, and violence; this one's not for the kiddies! It will make you squirm in your seat during some of the torture scenes, especially the tongue scene. I first saw this movie when I was a teenager (35 years ago) and something about it stuck in my mind; I think it may have been the ending."
4,Prepare to be disturbed!,"With it's Heidi type music, and frequent European overacting and bad dubbing, this interesting little flick will cause you to do a little soul searching. Not, ""is God real?"", but ""what on earth posessed me to watch this?"". Austria 1770, so thought do gooders would go about, (under the authority of the Church) and hunt witches. That's the plot. Not so bad....until the credits finish running. There are very realistic tourture scenes, burning humans at the stake, the rack, ripping outtoungues, one nasty jab to the eye, and other squeemish moments. Nothing is predictable! Anything you expect to happen doesn't. And don't pay too much attention to lovely couple, they are just a weak subplot to tie the whole sickening mess together. Don't miss this rare treat! Oh, and don't eat anything before and during that reminds you of body parts or fluids."
2,origionally rated v for violent or vomit,"i saw this movie when it aired in the 70's when i was a pre teen it really shocked me now i want to se i again to see if it lives up to my gory memory!- first minute preview:a man gets tared feathered shortly after having his hand axed off at mid palm if my memory serves me right""lefty's fingers were a flyin."
2,"HAD TO BE 1, NOT 2","I should've given it 1 instead of 2 stars. What positive can I mention about this film? Maybe just young Udo Kier who's wonderful, his eyes are just mesmerizing. What else? Of course beautiful and seductive Olivera Vuco. Apart from this there's nothing particular about this movie to be fond of. Well, maybe in 1970 it really seemed ""the most horrifying one ever made"". But, you know, ""Nosferatu"" which had been made about 50 years before looks by far more scary.Here acting is so-so, special effects... well, there are practically none. If you think you'll be terrified by a shocking sight of brutal tortures don't indulge in illusions. Everything that ought to be scary, violent, shocking, gross and disgusting is not that at all. Don't waste your time and money unless you are a hardcore horror fan for whom this flick is a must to watch and have. What a paradox, isn't it?"
4,Good reference,I like having this book around to study from on occasion. A lot of books don't include any Chinese language aspects so I chose this one for that purpose. Confucius is definitely open to interpretation so taking the time to study the principles is a must if you are interested in it.
4,A Good Read,"Roger Ames and Henry Rosemont offer a new translation of this Chinese classic of Confucius. While I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy or integrity of the translation, Ames and Rosemont have explained and offered justifications for their translations quite thoroughly. The result is an informative version of this classic text attributed to Confucius. Heavily discussing the ethics of ritual propriety and the need to be a ""junzi"" or ""exemplary person"", Confucius believed in wisdom and the law of reciprocity (the ""silver rule""). Clearly he was concerned with preserving a moral tradition extracted from the collective understanding of the past. While parts of Ames and Rosemont's introduction are tedious and could be better written, overall they have made a valuable contribution to the understanding of Confucian thought."
3,"Interesting, but contains contradictions.","I purchased this book for my wife who is studying Shakespeare as part of her English degree. This review is a quick summary of her comments on the book, while and after reading it.It was an interesting read that contained several useful comparison and reference charts that provided a wealth of information regarding the authorship question. The author contradicted herself more than once which detracted from her credibility. The book was written in a style that was apparently designed for short reads, included a lot of repetition and hindered smooth reading form cover to cover. The Countess of Pembroke is clearly a fascinating figure, however a different book would be more appropriate for her life story as this one is written focusing on the authorship question.Overall my wife is happy to have read the book and own it for future reference, however she is not 100% confident in all the information presented as facts."
5,Transporting,"I ordered this CD on the recommendation of a friend, and was instantly addicted! I agree with the first reviewer, that the variety in the collection is wonderfully satisfying. Listeners familiar with the Cambridge Singers will not be surprised, perhaps, by the quality of the performance. But I found it an unusually uplifting listening experience, and had to force myself to remove it from the CD in my commute car, so it wouldn't go stale. I've already given away a half dozen to friends and family. Stunning!"
4,A Fine Song! Great Production!,"""Good is Good"" is the long awaited new single from Sheryl Crow. It is, like the majority of Crow's singles, a great catchy tune without being too ""poppy"". Great production with the acoustic guitar and Sheryl's vocals in the forefront. The lead guitar intro-line sounds ,like ""The Light in Your Eyes"", greatly inspired by the sound of George Harrison. I love Sheryl's voice a lot, but I think she does not really show her powers on this song - only towards the end, with the repetition of the chorus where her voice almost cracks.There is only one more track on my version of the single; an acoustic version of ""Good is Good"". This is in fact exactly the same recording without the final overdubs ( guitars etc. )"
2,Broke almost immediately,Dont buy this product. It is of poor quality. The tip of the charger that goes into the pda broke off within a week.
3,"The ""Non-Rapid"" Car Charger","I did receive it in a timely fashion. It was packaged real nice. The problem is that it is not a ""RAPID"" car charger. It takes a long time to charge. It's not like the charger I had from the tmobile store. Also when you plug it up and use the phone at the same time it doesn't charge at all. It just keeps the phone going when you talk. As soon as you unplug it (that is if you were talking on the phone while it was supposed to be charging) it dies."
4,A Classic of the Genre,"This is an early classic in the genre. Not about the usual blood sucking vampire you find in today's books - although blood is part of it - but rather about a vampire, love, and the psychology of having something desired. Don't be fooled by the beginning either, it is the ending that contains the twist and surprise. A must read if you are a fan of the dark, mysterious, and forbidden."
2,Boring,Set too far in the past to hold my interest. Unable to understand the language or references. Too Confusing for me
1,Avoid the Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition is dreadful, not even worth .99. Nobody bothered to format it correctly and it's laid out like poetry."
4,To Do or Not To Do,"To Do Or Not to Do is a concise ""how to"" on what types of decisions there are for a manager and a team to use in the decision-making process. The book goes the extra step and describes how to get a team on board to make the various types of decisions. It provides a grid work for the leader to use in decision-making. My team and I enjoyed the freedom it gave everyone to participate when they knew what kind of decision I wanted."
4,Smelly!,"This is a great mat...thick and comfortable, BUT whew! it has a very heavy rubbery smell that permeates the room. I hope it airs out over time."
4,The Harbinger Mat is great!,I purchased this mat after reviewing many different ones on different sites. I ordered this one because of the thickness and size. I wanted something that would be comfortable on a hard floor and long enough so that my legs rest on the mat. It rolls up nicely and I can carry it to my gym when I need to. I am very satisfied with it.
5,"Agree with Harry Kruz-Make 3x8, 4x8, or even 6x6 sizes!","I am neutral on the rating; I don't have this product, but I have to chime in with Harry Kruz... If the manufacturer is listening-there's a HUGE market for bigger sizes and more color choices. Many exercises require more than one plane of motion, even on the floor; and stretching, abs, and many other workouts would benefit from a 3x8, 4x8, and even 6x6 and 8x8 mat for partner exercises. All this should be available in various thicknesses. I'm a fitness professional, and my clients have a wide range of needs in this area. I'd like to be able to better meet those needs. Let's take it into the new century!"
5,Exercise Mat,"This is a great mat, the thickest I've ever seen. It allows me to comfortably lie on the floor during my Yoga class without the discomfort that I experienced before buying it. I use the rolled up end of the very long mat as a neck support. This was a good buy."
4,comfy and warm,"This exercise mat is very nice. It's thick so when I do sit ups my back doesn't hurt. It's easy to warm up, great for winter. The rib creates good contraction. The only thing is that it might not be as steady as a think mat, the nice and bouncy foam can throw you off balance a little bit."
4,nice matt,this matt works well for me its soft and comfortable and long enough iam 6ft. 2in. 205 lbs. and shorter thinner matts just was was a bit uncomfortable very satisfied buyer.
2,Smelly,"A year later, many washes and after leaving it outside to breathe for days, it still smells a little too rubbery for me."
5,Great,"The Item arrived quickly. Great product, I am very pleased with the stick and padding for a comfortable yoga experience."
4,My first mat,"I loved this mat very much, I searched a lot for one that has almost everything, reasonable price, good thickness, easy to carry, appropriate dimensions, and an extra selling point (like the Antimicrobial treatment), I recommend this to anyone who is unsatisfied with his/her mat."
4,Knee Saving Mat,"I needed a mat that would be thick enough and dense enough to provide adequate cushioning for my knees when doing floor exercises on concrete. This mat does the trick. I have been very happy with it. I do wish it were wider, and it does have a tendency to stretch, but there do not appear to be any mats of the necessary thickness and density that have any different properties."
4,Love the extra cushioning!,I ordered this mat because I had started doing yoga at home. The extra thickness of this mat is just what I was looking for.That extra little bit makes a big difference. As others have noted there is an odor to the mat when first opened but that has dissapated as it has been used and exposed to the air. I don't even notice it now. Because I now have this comfortable mat I find myself more consistent with my at home regimen.
3,if this does not smell so much...,"This is cushy, thick, comfortable mat that I can use for Pilates exercise. I like the feel of the mat but wish it does not smell this bad. I leave it in my living room and it stinks up the whole living room! The smell is too strong I feel it is not healthy to inhale...Update: after a couple months of use, the mat does not smell much. However, I noticed the mat stretches too much when I and doing some standing up exercises. It reduces my body stability and limits my movement. Next time when I buy an exercise mat, I would choose something thinner and harder than this item.Thus I took one star from 4. Now it is 3."
4,Comfortable for stretching,I'm glad I finally found an affordable mat that's super thick and comfortable. I'd give it five stars if it were wider. That's just a dream of mine - a wider exercise mat. Still haven't found one.
4,"Good Mat, But It's Not Red","I needed a thicker mat for working out on my hardwood floors, and this mat certainly fits the bill. But just be warned that it is not actually a red mat. It is reddish-orange; I'd even say more orange than red."
4,Perfect thickness for exercise mat,"It took me awhile to find a 5/8"" thick foam mat, and it was worth it. It is the perfect thickness on my hardwood floor, it protects my back and still gives me stability. The only negative thing I can say is that it has a strong chemical smell. It fades over time, just air it out and use Febreze :)"
1,Toxic Smell,"Finding a thick mat to do sit ups on a wooden floor has been really hard due to the limited choices. However, this mat is the worse thing ever. It arrived in an almost opened box (poor packaging) but the best was yet to come. When I unwrapped it, I couldn't help notice but one thing only, this disturbing and very strong odor. After leaving it in my living room overnight, this strange odor had taken over the entire room. I wondered where are these items exactly kept, right next to household hazards??? I'm very surprise only one other review mentioned anything about this terrible odor. The one star is just for the correct thickness."
4,good but need to vent for a few weeks,it's very nice and thick but smelled pretty bad when i first got it. i laid it out for a few weeks to let the smell out and now it's perfect.
4,Great mat - strong chemical smell,"This item had a VERY distinct chemical and nearly over powering smell. I had to leave this item hanging outside and then in my garage for nearly 2 weeks for the smell to subside sufficiently to be able to use the product. FYI - no cleaning product had any effect.After smell subsided it meet my needs for a thicker pilates mat.Just be prepared to ""air"" the mat out before you use it"
2,Not good for yoga,I got this mat for yoga and it's way too thick for the standing postures. Balancing on the mat is very difficult. It also curls up at the ends.
4,Width not large enough,"The length is just wonderful. . . But I was a little disapointed at the width. This exercise mat is however perfect for sit-ups, crunches, but not for exercises that may require extending your hands and legs apart since you will pretty much touch the floor or carpet. Anyways I'm glad I have an exercise mat which is very comfortable."
3,Got it quick....but,"The mat is as described ... I was disappointed a little with the fact that it had three small ""holes"" in the foam. Doesn't affect the usage of the mat, but when I buy something new, I like it to look ""new"". It almost looked as though it had been perhaps returned by a previous customer. It is comfortable to exercise on and very portable as the straps secure it rolled."
3,"Good cushioning, but won't stay flat","I love the thickness of this mat, it provides plenty of cushioning for ab workouts and stretching. However, the darned thing doesn't stay flat when rolled out. I tried storing it upside down and flat for a week to smooth it out, but when you turn it over the end just rolled up again. I either had a little ""pillow"" that's curled up under my head after a situp, or my ankles would hit the ""pillow"" and my feet would hit the hardwood when I brought my legs back down. It's quite frustrating since there are two different sides to this mat (the top is smoother) and I have to set a chair on one end of it to hold the end down.And just a note, this mat is horrible for yoga. It's far too thick. The thickness is great for cushioning but awful for balance. But my 3 stars is based only on the fact that it doesn't stay flat."
1,Smells horrible.,"Please pay attention to some of the reviews below, not so sure about the positive one's here. I agree with E. Stapgen below, will smell up a whole room, even after airing outside. I do not recommend this product unless you enjoy toxic fumes.This is the second product I've tossed in recent days due to smell. Need to be more careful internet shopping."
4,Good & cushy,"While I wouldn't recommend this mat for standing poses since the cushiness makes stability in standing poses an issue,(if balance is at all an issue) if you're going to be lying on it or kneeling on it, it's nice to have some padding. Love the that it has its own straps attached and rolls right up to be carried away at the end of the class or exercise."
3,"great for pilates, not so much for yoga","I've used this mat for about 6 months. The thickness is great for pilates & floor exercises, especially on the knees. However, in various yoga poses, such as downward dog & plank, the soft, pliant, foamy material stretches WAY out (a lot like a rubber band) while I'm in the pose, so that my hands & feet keep getting further & further apart & I have to keep moving them in to keep the pose. The stretchy problem has gotten worse over time. It's also too thick (at my level) for the balance exercises, so I do the standing ones on the hard floor."
1,"Smells so terrible, it's unusable.","This mat provides perfect cushioning, but unfortunately, the smell is so terrible that it can't be used. I tried letting it air out for a week, and it still smells terrible. I tried to use it anyways, and the smell transferred to my clothes. If it is a simple matter of airing it out, Harbinger should have the sense to do so before shipping these out. Or perhaps a little quality control, Harbinger."
1,Garbage,"Over a month later, still has a toxic smell that's crippling to the senses. It'd be a fine product if one could use it, but if I bring it into a room I could practically incapacitate someone with the noxious fumes. This is totally unacceptable. Do not buy this product."
1,Be warned overwhelming noxious odor,"I could not use the product because the smell was so bad that I could not stay on mat long enough to do exercises. I got a bad headache, was light headed and woozy. Even after I let it air out it was terrible. I couldn't keep it anywhere indoors, because it made my whole apartment smell. I sent it back right away. I do appreciate that the seller took it back and refunded the money."
3,"Nice quality, smell VERY strong at first","I got this specifically because I am doing a Bikram yoga class, so I though anti-microbial might be a good idea in a room of hot sweaty people. Received it and the quality is really nice, but the smell was so strong at first. Assuming it has to do with the anti-microbial treatment as well as it being plastic. However, I left it out unrolled for 2 weeks, the smell has definitely subsided. Thank goodness because I was ready to return it. So my recommendation is to let it air out for a little if anti-microbial is important to you."
5,A good product,Good quality. But as a rookie yoga/exercise gal...ya can't use a mat on a carpet....don't bother.
3,antibiotic coating?,"There was nothing on the mat or the packaging about the antibiotic coating described on the amazon page. I have strong doubts that this mat has any such coating.Otherwise a nice mat. Bulky, but if it were any thinner you would feel the floor."
4,Harbinger Exercise Mat,"The mat was delivered promptly - always a plus - and is perfect for what I need it for. I found that thinner mats were uncomfortable for me when doing pilates and this mat is really nice and thick. I've tried every exercise on this mat that was uncomfortable for me before and now have no discomfort at all. It does have that 'new mat' smell, but it's not at all overpowering - I keep it in my bedroom and have never noticed the odour."
4,Great comfortable mat,This is a very comfortable mat and has changed my rolling exercises in Pilates. It feels luxurious in its length and thickness. I only worry that it will never uncurl if I curl it too tight!
3,exercise mat,"I bought this mat for my yoga class. Unfortunately the class is taught in a basement with a very hard linoleum floor. My regular yoga mat was not thick enough and my knees would hurt in certain postures. I bought this mat thinking that it would make it easier on my knees to do yoga. I used it once and I feel bad about returning it b/c I used it. The mat is squeaky and my barefeet stick to it. I cannot glide and flow in my postures because the mat is so sticky and people look at me when I move my feet b/c it makes so much noise. I know this is not meant to be a yoga mat. Maybe when I exercise indoors I will use it for its intended purpose. In the meantime, I bought two area rugs as my yoga mat and I cannot move them as much as I like but I do not get the sounds effects and my feet do not stick. They slide, but very slightly."
4,Great but kinda stinky,"I love this mat, but I've yet to figure out how to get the chemical smell out of it.Update:After a few years the smell finally left. This is a great mat for basic exercises, DO NOT use for yoga it stretches and you can injure yourself. I'm waiting for my new yoga mat to come in. Yay!"
2,disappointed,"The quality may be there, but my first one was damaged and now the replacement is more a bright pumkin orange than red, so it needs to go back again.I have to give up on this one I guess and try to find another in a true red."
2,Farscape Book Fails to Impress,"I bought this book with the impression that it would be a well-thought-out, incisive and detailed book about Farscape - the underrated science fiction series from USA Networks' Sci-Fi Channel. I was disappointed.The book is hastily written, rife with typos, and looks as if it were printed at Kinko's. It's copied onto heavy paper and cardstock, has no photos, and is essentially 18 episode synopses, reviews by the author, and the same for a variety of websites - most of which have more involved, intricate and entertaining information than this.The author obviously likes the show, and has substantial knowledge of what makes it tick, but does very little to express that in this book. There is nothing to hold your interest for more than a page or two, and it looks little better than a fanzine. I expected a LOT more than this.Sorry, but I can't recommend it. Even Rygel would spit on this."
1,It's a FAKE bag!,"Please don't buy the bag, it's fake.I ordered it last week, pricing 899.99, now it's 799.99The smell of the leather is strange and handle is made of some cheap rope.I returned it immediately and warned Amazon not to post it any more.To my disappointment, it even lower the price, trying to get rid of the stock.Amazon, so shamed of you!"
3,Antique White Desk,"Nice looking desk. Somewhat odd color. It took a couple of evenings to put together. The worst part is that the drawers never work without dragging and sticking,no matter how many ajustments. We took our time putting the desk together, and the sticking drawers were from the manufacturing of it. Too heavey to send back, so we live with sticking drawers."
5,"""We Love You"" - Pizzicato Five","I love this CD. Good compilation of previously released material, much of which I'd not heard before. One of my better music purchases this year."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A couple of storylines here, and they are only average. Wonder Woman has to cope with a philosophical paradox when she is caught in a sticky situation with her lasso.Plastic Man goes back to family, when he looks into what his occasionally seen son is up to, along with a bit of help from his friends."
5,Great portrayal of Wonder Woman,"The writer and artist both gave a superb representation of the Amazon Princess and this story did a great job presenting her as the focal point. Also, the Batman/Plastic Man team-up (harkening back to the Brave and the Bold days) gave me a new appreciation for a character I was determined to hate."
5,another perfect team,"joe kelly and dough mahnke makes a perfect combination,just like morrison and quitely,or ennis and dillon,or loeb and sale,mills and bisley,jodorowsky&moebius.;and while i think morrison is very good,i prefer the way kelly writes jla.morrison is better suited for x-men.the story is fun,the characters well described and used.there's an exchange between bats and ww that are fantastic.or plastic man trying to get a peek at ww in her chambers.but the best of it is mahnke's artwork.superior to any of the artist who accompanied morrison on the jla.he's just getting better and better,since his days drawing the mask,and the classic mask versus lobo.he draws plastic man quite a bit like mask sometimes,the wildest i've seen him.at the end there's a separate short story about bats and plastic man that is just pure poetry.really excellent.after having read this,i'm certainly getting ""the obsidian age"" too!"
5,Thought Provoking and Touching,"Having never read Mr. Girzone prior to this book,I would have to say he is my favorite author to date. Anyone with a child and a belief in God will have a hard time not being able to relate to it's content.A book I found impossible to put down."
3,Joey is not indicative of other Girzone books,"Joseph Girzone, who is most commonly known for his Joshua books, did not write Joey with the same flair. While I enjoyed Joey....it was not with the same relish and can't put down zeal that I felt with the Joshua books."
5,Cool Shirt,Got it as a gift for my brother- he really likes it. A good mixture of adorable and completely hideous.
5,Booster shot for moms,"In everything we do in life we need ""booster shots"". If you're a teacher, real estate agent, etc. you're required to take more classes to keep your certification. If you're a mom, it's important to stay focused on the joys of motherhood instead of the ""to do's"" of motherhood. Tammy Bundy does an amazing job of retelling stories from our own lives. But here's the value, she reminds us of the beauty in each mommy situation from trying to squeeze in some exercise to cleaning sock drawers to McDonald's drive throughs to Poke Mon t-shirts. Ms. Bundy reminds us what we already know -- children are an amazing blessing from God!"
3,Help at Hand Dialer,Seemed nicely put together and instructions were good but I returned solely on the basis of pendant with it's ring that you actually pull out being 1) too difficult for my Mom to pull out and 2) concern that the ring would get lost
1,Warning to Iowa customers,If you live in Iowa and program this device to dial 911 you are violating Iowa State law. I do not know if it is legal in other states.
5,Saw it had to have it,My son has been a huge Abbott and Costello fan since he was 6. At 8 he recited the Who's on First bit at a family dinner he watches all their movies. He's a major fan. I saw this at my fiancé's father's house and knew I had to find one. My son and I love baseball and I just could see him treasuring the poster for years. The dialogue was different almost every time the guys did the bit. We listened to many radio programs of Abbott and Costello. So the wording on the poster may be slightly different then you remember. But beneath a picture of them - I assume the photo is from the 'Naughty Ninties' there is the dialogue of the infamous Who's on First that Abbott and Costello immortalized.
2,My review,"This CD is not a 5 star work. The songs all sound the same. I have nothing against it, I bought it, but it's something other than one of my top 20 CD's I have."
5,"Beautiful, spiritually uplifting music!","John Rutter brings us another beautiful Christmas CD! I purchased two Christmas recordings of the Clare College choir (also conducted by John Rutter) and they were so beautiful I ordered this about a week later. I was not disappointed, and if you love beautiful, heavenly Christmas music, you won't be either! Some of my favorites were ""Angels' Carol"", ""O holy night"", and ""What sweeter music"", but there isn't a bad song on this album. I plan on playing this music year-round. I've gotten to the point that I am able to recognize John Rutter's sound on the radio (and I'm not a music expert). The gentle yet vibrant voices are very unique and frequently bring tears to my eyes."
4,Angels' Carol,I've sung this song with my choir and found it incredible. I keep looking for the recording of this song until I find it in this CD in Amazon.com. It's a great pleasure for me.
1,condescending & silly,"I found the general tone of this book both condescending and silly. The information is basic and obvious. Zebala & Jones's ""Medical School Admissions"" is better, as are others."
3,Encouraging,"For the non-traditional applicant, Dr. Brown's book is insightful and encouraging. While lacking a bit in the school-review section (no juicy details here), it takes on the process of applying to Medical School as a personal carpe-diem search rather than a run in the rat race often depicted by books geared toward nervous 20-year-old grade-thirsty premeds. Worth a 2nd read."
1,Cult Camp Classics,Land of the Pharaohs was excellent but the others in the set were notworth the price of the postage which was ZERO.
3,Decent,"Land of the Pharaohs was by far the best film in this collection. The Prodigal had some nice moments. The less said about ""Colossus"", the better."
5,Truly one of the best books I have ever read!,"I am not much on book reviews, but I feel moved to tell everyone willing to listen how marvelous and seductively compelling this novel is. Every moment in the narrative is captured perfectly by Grossman's mixture of the esthetic and literary with the painful reality of the Holocaust. Please read it! I have no idea why this novel is not more widely known and more lavishly praised."
2,Not suitable for recent BMW cars,"The tool is well built, but not very easy to operate with just 2 hands since positioning of hooks on spring can be an exercise in frustration.The bad news - forget to use this on recent BMW models like E60 platform: front springs even non-sport version are to short and to strong for this tool to handle, I reached maximum 30 ft/lb torque on the forcing screw but still was short about 1.5 inch so was unable to assemble the strut.More bad news - on thick springs like BMW hooks are not seating securely during compression due to hook design - potentially serious health hazard."
5,OTC is outstanding!!!1,"I own a 2000 Hyundai Sonata and needed to have the struts replaced. I refused to pay $1200 dollars to replace the struts, mounts, baffles, and bushings. So I decided to do it myself. I had the parts but was scarfed to death to use the widow maker 2 piece clamp and jaw set from the auto store. I researched and reviewed all the affordable and well designed tools and OTC was my final choice.I have to say this tool was perfect for the job. It is well engineered and built. The welds are master quality and the steel is high grade. There was no time during the compression or release that I ever felt nervous or feared for my life. I even left the spring compressed over 24hours due to a mix up at the auto store. They gave me the wrong struts for my vehicle. The easiest part of the process was the OTC clam shell spring compressor. I used my bare hands and a ratchet to compress the spring, no air tools, with ease.I have never purchased OTC before, but I will in the future."
5,Great Tool,The first few strut jobs I did I payed he local muffler shop $150 a pair to swap over the springs. The I tried the two threaded rod kits. But after purchasing this tool I was amazed at how grea this tool is. One of the best tools I own. Easy to use and as good as a larger more expensive unit.
3,I Agree With Fluffy,"I agree with the fluffy review in that this book contains little more than a course in Real Estate 101. Bronchick does, however, provide some good advice on the legal aspects of real estate but barely touches the flipping subject. I also read Berges' book on flipping properties and once again have to agree with Fluffy that his book is much more thorough than this one. Berges really nails the financial analysis of properties, too, more so than any of the other 20+ books on real estate I've read.My advice is to buy Bronchick's book if you want to learn about the legalities of real estate and buy Berges' book if you want to learn about real estate finance."
1,Weak,"Just a gloss over. Offers some weak advice. Look for the worst house in the best neighborhood - ????? Everybody and their dog does that, and how many ratty houses are there in good neighborhoods? For a book like this to be worth anything it needs to offer advice you cant get elsewhere. Try ""Fast Cash"" by LeGrand for better."
4,best out of 3,"I ordered 3 books relating to investing in real estate. Out of the 3, this was the best one. It's easy to understand.Only downside is it doesn't go into enough detail in specific topics, i.e. taxes. I had to purchase additional books to assist in that area. He frequently refers you to other books/resources. If he would've covered those topics himself and went into more details on other topics, it would've been close to a complete guide."
2,Cheaper then the Infomercials,"If you're the type of person that thinks they can get rich quick, then by all means buy this book. It's much cheaper then any of the infomercials about flipping properties on TV. However, it's not a good resource for the investor who wants to learn how to acquire real estate for the long term.After reading the first chapter I realized this isn't the way I want to buy and acquire properties. It seemed like a way to prey upon the misfortunes of others. A much better and more thorough book on property acquisitions is 'Investing in Real Estate.' Investing also tells you how to 'flip' properties, but doesn't advise it. For all the people that are making money off of flipping, many more are losing their shirts."
2,Disappointing Guide to Flipping Properties,"I bought this book expecting a guide to flipping properties, but it ended up being a terrible disappointment.First of all the length of the book is deceptive as they use large font, wide margins, and frequent subheadings. In standard format it would fill around 75 pages at best.More importantly the content is unoriginal and of no help. There is no definition of what the author considers ""flipping"" a property. There are no concrete guidelines to use--only vague generalities found in any real estate book.I think the best comparison of this book would be to a stock picking book with the premise of ""buy low, sell high"" but with no real information on how to value stocks, how long to hold, how to buy on margin, etc.Honestly, this is the first negative book review that I've written. Save your money and read the book in the bookstore to see for yourself...then put it back and move on."
2,No meat!!!,"I tried to read this book, tried, then I made myself read it. But soon enough I had to quit. It has nothing to offer as far as ""Hey, this is a good technique."" or ""Hey, try this."" Not even a story to examplify. It's more like: ""Yeah, you need financing and a cheap house that you can fix, and there's a bunch of ways to do that. The End.""I could never get halfway through it. It's still brand new. Maybe there's something good in it somewhere in there. But I have no time to look for a golden needle in a stack of hay.There's way too many other books out there that can be more profitable."
2,Not a very good book,The book has basis ideas and principals maybe good for a beginner. No real good outline and is a lot of fluff. If you're looking a book on real estate investing try reading The Millionaire Real Estate Investor
3,Not very practical,Not a very practical book in a hot real estate market like california. It may have applied in the late 80's or early 90's but not now. None the less you may get some new ideas from it.
1,Too Simple,This is a very basic book that does not seem to contain any really new information unless you are totally new to the concept.
3,Inconsistent,"This book is helpful in some ways, but confusing in others. Many of their creative financing suggestions are laughable - if the sellers were receptive to that sort of thing, they wouldn't be facing foreclosure.I personally preferred Michael Corbett's ""Find it, Fix it, Flip it"" for a better discussion of the basics."
3,same old same old,this book was long on promise short on delivery. It gives good base information without going into a lot of detail. It would make a good starting point for someone with no experience but should probably be passed by if you are looking for advanced knowledge.
1,"Don't buy, there are much better products","My dad had picked up a pack of these old ""plastic bubble balloons"" at some market in china town and it took me back to my childhood so i decided to look online and would buy tons of different brands to see which is besti got 4 kinds and this is clearly the worstit is the most toxic smelling of the ""plastic bubble balloons"" they of course all smell like acetone (they have acetate in it)this brand is also the least easy to make bubbles withthere are quite a few other brands on amazon alone that are truly better than this oneCAUTION: with any ""plastic bubble balloons"" use in a well ventilated room or outside there are alot of toxic fumes that come off of the material the product is made from ... this is not by any means a kids toy (in this day and age)"
1,Disappointed,"I've seen Tim Conway for years and think he is the funniest person alive, but the scenes on this DVD were terrible."
2,Too trite,"I thought it was more of the funny stuff he did with Carol Burnett, but unfortunately it was not that funny."
1,zero,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. THERE ARE GREAT TV INTERPLAY SEQUENCES SOMEWHERE AVAILABLE, BUT THESE SCENES ARE WORSE THAN PEDESTRIAN. AND--- VERY FEW IN NUMBER. WHICH I REGARD AS LIFESAVING IF PROLONGED! I WAS SUCKED IN BY A TV AD WHICH DID FALSELY REPRESENT THIS DUD."
2,Tim Conway dvd,I have watch a fair amount of tim conway and these were not the highlights of his career I would have chosen....You are better off going to youtube.
2,Tim Conway,We were disappointed with this dvd. We had not seen Tim Conway in anything other than the Carol Burnett Show and he iwas hilarious in their skits. Not so in this dvd.
4,Bonus Review?,"Hailing from St. Louis, Timmy Co Co speaks the truth. At times, you wish he would just STFU, but, you later realize, HE CAN'T STOP TALKING CUZ HE KNOWS EVRAYTHANG!!! Take a look at the BONUS TRACKS because raiiir see, they're really great here, see. Not buying this would be bad news.....FERRRR YOUUUUUU!!!! A can't miss for anyone who wants a severe pain in the arse."
3,Tim Conway: Timeless Comeday,The DVD is funny. Although I thought there was going to be more on there and they weren't as funny as his skits on the Carol Burnette Show. I still enjoyed the DVD and am glad I bought it.
4,Enjoyable Book,"I liked this book. The book is made up of 2 stories. I thought that the first story (A Little Bit Country) was more fun to read than the second story (Country Bride). In the second story, Kate just couldn't believe she was in love with Clay and this seemed a little far fetched to me. Over all it was still a good book."
5,Country Brides,I love all of Debbie's books. Country Brides has a cute story line. I could not put it down. Debbie write's so you feel as if you were there in the small town she is writing about.
2,Filth for filth's sake,"Julian Clary's biog I found disgusting!! I am as broad minded as the next person, & more so than many, but this book was filth for filth's sake. His descriptions of what he gets up to were graphic to say the least & went far beyond just trying to shock. I can't believe that anyone could admit to being that irresponsible!If/when he dies of AIDS he will have infected 100's of men ( & a few women) YUK!"
3,Great collectible,"As a controller this one is kind of lame, it is a lot smaller than the standard 1st party GC controllers and the right analog (or ""C"") stick is too tight. Like many other Nubytech products, it feels kind of cheap.It comes in a real nice plastic dome, the top clear-blue part screws in and feels very secure but there are 2 clear stickers that were obviously not designed to stick on top of a curved surfaced and have small creasesI would only recommend this to either hardcore Megaman X fans or GameCube collectors and only if you can find it for a decent price.A rare/uncommon display piece, only worth having as a collectible."
4,Good but with some limitations,"The book is very good and very complete. I only see 2 problems! First, all the pictures are in black & white. Even the paintings wich takes off a bit of the magic of the camera work. The second thing, is that the information doesn't seam to be very well organized. I'm talking about the subtitles. We're presented with all the images in a row (from each 2 pages) and then, at the end of the second page, we have all the subtitles together.In the end, it is very good for the money that's asked for it but not too good..."
5,Where fancy is bred,"I am surprised there are not more reviews here yet of this marvelous CD. I heartily concur with the other reviewer; it is a magnificent and fun trip. If the reader knows Rutter's music at all, he will probably know that he has a rare melodic gift; the settings and songs on this CD will linger long in your mind after it has stopped playing. I tell you truly: if you enjoy choral music in any form, you should buy this collection immediately. It has in it the pure delight of childhood, viewed with the wisdom of age. And if you enjoy Rutter's style, try also the more brooding and powerful Requiem. A treasure."
5,Pure Electronic Bliss,"A mixture of Romantic lyrics and breathtaking eclectronic music, Color Theorys first cd, Sketches In Grey, is a groundbreaking new sound that will take synthpop to a new level."
4,Holocaust History for Middle Schoolers,"This books is a good historical treatment for middle school students. The first half of the book tells about Hitler and the German extermination of the Jews and the second half tell the Jews' side of the story. Black and white pictures are plentiful with one every few pages. Kids will understand how prevalent anti-Semitism was when they see the picture of a game board for ""Jews Get Out,"" a board game sold in Germany in 1939 and 1940. The one thing I did not like was on a map which shows the destruction of the Jews in Europe by country (showing the number of Jews killed over the prewar Jewish population), you cannot read the numbers for Poland because they are stuck in a crack. Also the map of Europe under the German Rule is hard to read because of its black and white color scheme. But all in all, the book is an easy to read and informative history of this time."
2,Get the original folks!,"Yes its true, this a reprint of a much more impressive book....and without reservation get that one, not this foggy weak shadow of the original.When I opened the package containing this book I was excited about a supposed new and improved Bacon book , minutes later the book was back in the package and returned. This reprint is NOT AS GOOD AS ITS ORIGINAL, I would say the print job is quite muddy compared to the 1983 version...so buy that one, it is still available...this is solid advice from a serious Bacon enthusiast, heed it ."
4,very well done,"Good overview of bacons working career. color is good,images clear and explanations of work and time frame very well organized"
3,A different slant,"John Russell wrote this ""biography"" while Francis Bacon was very much alive and tends to emphasize the influences on Bacon's work more from an environmental standpoint than an art historian view. But to jump into Bacon's raucous life ""in medias res"" is a gift that now can be savoured, like picking the grapes off the vines that in years to come will become a fine vintage wine. A diversion, and only in black and white reproductions, but a rather important comment in retrospect."
5,francis bacon,"Well i really think that Francis Bacon is a great artist. I just stratid reading about his art work and he has so many goos drawings like Henrretta Moraes, and his selft portrait. They are veri nice drawings.So i really think his greatt."
5,Wealth of Knowledge,"In a way this is sort of the 'Code Complete' of game programming books. The LaMothe books are pretty decent, but he doesn't always distill the content very well. You end up with 25 pages describing what you could in about 5. On the other hand, McShaffry really shows his experience by PACKING this book with tons of useful info. Even if you just randomly picked one page a day to read and digest, your bag of tricks would grow exponentially. This is quite good - not necessarily a beginning programming book, but if you have a couple years of experience, you'll get a lot out of it. I highly recommend it."
5,A good start,"It doesn't tell you everything that you need (it doesn't explicitly talk about game engine architecture, for example), but it is a good place to start. Recommended for those that just finished their first OOP class, and beyond."
2,"Fresh and entertaining, but flawed","The book is a nice, refreshing read with many intersting and helpful examples from the trenches, providing a good general overview. As such, it would deserve 5 stars.Unluckily, the C++ code snippets show a profound lack of basic C++ understanding. To give a few examples, replicating std::pair functionality as ""useful template"", checking pointers returned by operator against null for validity and eror checking, and ""safe deleting"" pointers (checking for zero before calling operator delete and setting the pointer to null thereafter) or talking of constructors that cannot fail when objects are allocated via the normal, throwing operator new are things that do not precisely enhance the reader's confidence in the overall quality of a book's third edition published in 2009 (neither does startup code which will not run under a non-privilegued user on any recent version of Windows)."
2,One big gripe...,"Although the author, in his comment below, points out that correctly-running code is available at his web site, he neglects to note that this code will only work with Visual Studio .NET, the latest-greatest-and-most-expensive release from Microsoft. I would guess that most people who would be interested in this book would be more likely to own Visual Studio 6.0, but the source code won't compile under that product. The web site offers little more than a suggestion that the user without the megabucks to get the new Visual Studio should simply rewrite the source code to get it to run under 6.0...but I would suspect that, if you have the programming skills to do that, you probably don't need this book! To my mind, it borders on the unconscionable to release a book with code that only a few well-heeled readers will be able to afford to use, then shrug off that barrier by suggesting that the rest of us should simply ""roll your own."""
3,Dry read,"A very dry read, even for a programmer. It eventually gets interesting but its annoying when it constantly wants to remind you that game programming is hard and taxing."
3,Pretty good but.....,"This was a good story and filled in some holes in the life of Selaney and Alberich. The editing really needed work though. At one point, she couldnt decide what character was a bard or a trainee. Another point, the timeline regarding the death of the King of Rethwellen doesnt match with the one in ""By the Sword"" (by quite a bit).Otherwise, I really enjoyed it and I look forward to more Valdemar books!"
3,"An OK story, but not the best","I like the characters in this story. I don't even mind Myste, although I agree it is a bit ""Mary Sue"". What bugged me about this book, and has bothered me about ML's books for some time, is the fact that she appears to be forgetting that something needs to happen for there to be a plot. Yes, it is nice to have an understanding of some of the training the Heralds undergo, and to understand what it is like to be a teacher, but it doesn't take 400 pages of day-to-day life in the school to do that.I sometimes wonder if she is getting paid by the word, because it seems that the books could be half the size there are and still have every bit as much plot and action.All that being said, I still enjoyed the book and will buy her future books as well. I love the world and the characters she has created."
1,A waste,"I generally enjoy Mercedes Lackey's books.i have tried to write this review several times, but I seem to be at a loss trying to find the words describing exactly how bad this book is. Characters, writing, [lack of] storyline... frankly, it is trash.I strongly advise skipping this book. The only thing you will miss is wasting part of your life."
4,appreciation ;),I thought that Exile's Valor was as always...a wonderful book. I have been reading Mercedes Lackey for about 2 years now..and I am just a teenager. She's awesome! She's up there with J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K. Rowling for me! I discovered her one day because I started reading Raymond E. Feist's collection of stories. Then i seriously got hooked on Science Fiction. Now I am hoping to go into the author's business. Anyways back to the book ^.^.The only thing i really really hope that Ms. Lackey is gonna do is write another novel about Alberich...i wanna know what happens between him and Myste. If she is gonna write another one..then i give this one 5 stars instead! Alberich is a wonderful character. He is starting to get accepted in the Valdemaran society and is learning to become tough and supportive and everything. It's awesome.
4,more male roles,"I notice this author tends to prefer female stars. the exile's valor books blend a male hero with strong female charactures. a very nice blend I enjoyed reading. however, I have not taken to most of the heroan rolls in her other works. Thus I dont read most of her writtings. I am simply me take my comments for that alone."
1,Publishing error - it might not be the book you think....,"If you ordered this book, start reading it immediately to make sure you got the correct book. When I got mine, the cover looked OK, but the story inside was Omega by Jack McDevitt.Apparently, the publisher put the wrong binding on some of the books."
2,"Re-read your own books, Mercedes...","For those of you that don't know, Misty is Mercedes Lackey's nickname (her married last name is Dixon... Miss D, Misty...).You may have noticed a character in this book and Exile's Honor named Myste. Particularly in this book she seems to have a solution for a lot of things, plus has a nice romantic relationship with the main character. Of course, this character makes no appearence that I recall in the previously written books that come after this, the Arrows of the Queen books.Ah-hem, anyway... one of the things that nagged me throughout the books was that Prince Karathanelan was referred to as Prince Karath.In all previous references to him, including by his own brother in By the Sword, he was Prince Thanel. Heck, in all other descriptions of the story, he died, and THEN his father died, but no, not here.Misty, read your own books again before you write another AND stop making yourself a character, huh?"
4,books,"if you are thinking about doing this, don't. the book points out all the reasons we have affairs and why they are harmful."
4,This book was the best I found on this subject.,"In my late twenties, I found my marriage falling apart and shortly thereafter I found myself in an intimate relationship with my best friend. My best friend was married and he decided to stay with his wife. I was hurt and devastated and was deeply searching for some help understanding what I had felt and how to comprehend everything that was going on. This book helped greatly. I recently recommended the book to a mother of a friend who's daughter is in a similiar position. I am now actively dating, with a better understanding of who I am and the confusing elements of relationships. Someday, when I do find Mr. Right, I'll be much better prepared to establish a relationship, using many of the tools I was able to develop by reading this book."
1,Make sure it is what you want.,I had a problem ordering these items twice. Both times I recieved a the model number 818c2 instead of these. The funny thing was someone had the audacity to place computer printed labels over the model numbers on the buble pack with the 812c2. (as if you wouldn't notice.) So i returned them twice and gave up.
3,Good looking watch but very thick,I bought this watch but I had to return it as the watch is very thick not suitable for my hand
2,NOT Swiss - movement made in Japan! CHEAP QUALITY!,"NOT Swiss - movement, made in Japan! CHEAP QUALITY!. . .This watch - while looking good - was misadvertised by Amazon. The descriptor said ""Swiss-made watch"" but the watch I received definitely has a Japanese movement - NOT a Swiss-made movement. The watch I received was NOT worth as much as the ""$395.00 List Price"" Amazon represented. If it had truly been ""Swiss-made"" with a Swiss movement, the price would have been right. The watch I received only has a retail value of about $199.00 - CHECKED AT A LOCAL MALL WATCH STORE!. . .This watch gains about 30 seconds per day, which is terrible for what was supposed to be a ""quality"" instrument. But I evidently have no recourse to actually receive the quality of watch I expected as advertised from Amazon.. . .I feel that I was totally ripped-off by Amazon with false and/or misleading information. I won't make that mistake again!. . ."
3,k&n cold intake,"I AM PLEASED WITH THE EXTRA PERFORMANCE,THE SOUND WHEN YOU STEP ON IT AND THE WAY IT LOOKS.I INSTALLED THIS ON MY 2007 LEXUS IS250, WITH A FEW PROBLEMS. 1. THE INSTRUCTIONS WHERE FOR A 2005 IS250 AND A 2006 IS350.THE AIR BOX ON MY CAR DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE ON THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE INSTRUCTIONS STATED TO CUT 6in OFF THE RUBBER THAT GOES AROUND THE BOX.ON MY BOX YOU DO NOT REMOVE ANY RUBBER I AM GLAD I TRIED EVERY THING BEFORE CUTTING THE RUBBER STRIP.THE AIR FILTER CAME WITH TO MUCH OIL AND THE POLISHED CHROME RAM WHERE THE FILTER ATTACHES TO SHOULD BE SANDED TO REMOVE THE SMOOTH SURFACE BECAUSE I DIN'TAND THE FILTER SLID OFF CAUSING THE COMPUTER TO MALFUNCTION SO I HAD TO GO TO MY LEXUS DEALER TO DX THE PROBLEM."
4,Lexus IS350,"The claim was direct fit. Not so on my car, close enough to not send it back.... but not close enough I didnt have to make adjustments to it and my car. Made my car hum and louder, with new exhaust afterward it really hums a tune."
1,Your Money or Your Life - Not the OTHER book!,"Wow! I bought this book because I thought it was the other book with the same title that actually contains valid information about improving your financial well-being. I few quaint stories about the fact that relationships are worth more than any money...I agree, but I wouldn't have paid the money to listen to what my wife reads to me in People magazine every week. It made for a short audio book and I was left waiting for the punchline."
1,What a piece of junk,"There was no ""there"" there. This book is just a bunch of pseudo-facts strung together to create a book that would sell before the empty suits on Faux News lose what little popularity they have right now. I can't believe I wasted time and money reading this."
1,I expected this from a Fox News anchor,"So let me guess this right, the Surplus we has under Clinton was a bad thing, but the huge deficit we now have under Geogre W Bush is great.Cavuto is the type of Business Person who relies on Cheney economics, make cuts to workers, send the Factory to Mexico, so it looks like the company is making profit, where the truth is normally the reverse.This book just tries to spin all the Good things about this country into bad during the 90's, and all the bad things about this country in the 21st Century to good.Its a waste of paper."
5,Snug as a bug in a rug!,"I go camping in the mountains, and it gets pretty cold at night, but you couldn't tell unless you got out of this sleeping bag. The draw string that cinches up around your face is awesome. It may not be good for someone who likes room in their sleeping bag, or someone who is claustrophobic, but I love it!"
1,"I'm very dissapointed in this COLEMAN so called ""SLEEPING BAG""","I have known Coleman camping products for years and was very pleased and satisfied. Among other similar products description of it sounded like a decent sleeping bag.It is far from truth , for it's very narrow one can't turn in it with OUTER Zipper onlythat snaps open at the BOTTOM of the bag.I have tried sleeping in it ONE time only. Next day i stuffed it back in it's bag and placed in on shelve in storage room.On top, it arrived in ugly brown color."
4,Great bag.,"I've had this thing for a while now and used it in the winter, and it hasn't let me down. It's a little billowy, but I guess that's the compromise you make for getting lighter materials. Overall, I'd say it's a bag you want to store in your main pack compartment, rolled out a little to fill space and maintain your stability; compression bag works great as a food/incidentals bag if you do this. I recommend it."
4,Comfortable but not compact,"We needed a compact sleeping bag that could fit inside a carry-on bag for air travel. This one is not quite small enough, though we were able to make it work. At it's smallest, it is about the size of a basketball, though oval. It definitely does not squish smaller than the 10 x 14"". It is also difficult to squeeze back into the bag because there are no strings or straps and the slick material fights you. I recommend long shoelaces, because there is not room for the buckle on a compression strap.The bag is comfortable, roomy enough through the hips and feet for a tall teen, pretty much as described. As others noted, the color has changed to a nice blue with charcoal.This will be a nice bag for vacations. I would not recommend it for backpacking, and air travel is iffy if you are trying not to check bags. However, we could not find a smaller one for the price, especially with a 15 degree rating. Overall this is a good bag for the price."
5,ONJ Fan,"As a Olivia Newton John Fan since seeing Grease at 7 years old I think this movie was great. I will watch and buy anything that she is involved with. She is such an inspiration to us all. The first time I saw Chloe was on ""A Christmas Romance."" She has grown into a beautiful, talented girl who I hope to hear music from someday. I liked the chemistry they had on screen. I guess it is not a stretch to play mother and daughter when you do it every day. I recommend this movie to anyone. It is a great story with some good messages."
4,"Good movie, Great Olivia","This was a good movie, although I think Olivia Newton-John needs to quit making Dale Shores movies. Jasmine Wilde (ONJ) is a one hit wonder who is now working in an animal shelter. Her daughter Issy (Chloe Rose Lattinzi, who is her real life daughter) wants to become a singer and go to Hollywood to record. She does not know about her mother's success, but finds out after she finds some magazines in her mothers's closet with Jasmine on the cover.Olivia and Chloe are both great in this movie, (Although Chloe didn't inherrit talents as great as Olivia's) and any Olivia Newton-John should see this one. The movie was filmed ""on location"" in Australia, even though it was supposed to be in Georgia and Hollywood. Good movie, Great Olivia. She alson sings the song, Trust Yourself, which she wrote, and playes it on the guitar."
5,The best book of tumoral histopathology in this time!!!!,"well, my english is not so good, but I'll try to explain my opinions about this extraordinary book: I'm a proffesor of Pathology in Maracaibo, Venezuela, especifically in Veterinary Pathology and mi field of studied is the comparative pathology of tumours. This book represented the most advanced updated that I have been read. The ilustrations and the text are of high quality, very concise and clear. I recommended this excellent book both veterinary pathologist and human pathologist"
3,LIKED THE BOOK,Liked the book. The movie kinda left me cold. Though I can watch Ernest Borgnine in any part even Gato Gorde.
4,A better Movie than the critics said!,"Certainly looks a bit dated and the lead was a little wooden to say the least but not a bad ""Big Picture"" from Lewis Gilbert....well worth watching!"
1,Atrocious soap opera set in a lamebrained fictional country,"Moth-balled, laughably atrocious soap opera set in a lamebrained fictional country in South America, with revolutions, protests, chemistry-less romantic triangles, and embarrassing performances thrown in for equal measure. Tries to be a serious political drama, but fails to conjure up any emotion or offer anything new."
3,Great late 60's fashion and style,"This movie was a bomb when it first came out and I can see why. BUT, for those who love late 60's retro-style you get almost three hours of it. The cool fashions, cars and beautiful people kept me interested. I mean it's no Gone With The Wind but for those of us who would have loved to be trust fund babies lounging around our daddy's villas hip deep in the 60's party scene, this movie is for you."
4,"harold robbins' ""adventurers"" is 70's cheesey look at jet set and politics","this THREE HOUR MOVIE,REPEAT THREE HOUR MOVIE, is based on the harold robbins novel of the same name and is one of those all star cast soap movies that along with disater movies ruled the box office in the 70's. as for the review that questioned the rating,well in the 70's this was rated MA or the same as an R today, but really this trash movie isn't as bad as people make it out to be. for one the running time isn't that bad as the movie moves at a quick pace and is always engageing and fun. much like all of mr. robbins novels this is high class junk food and if taken as such this tale of vengeance,greed,sex,power,love,hate,and great 70's sex scenes is quite a good time. just don't expect ""gone with the wind""! just sit back eat some popcorn and enjoy!"
5,A GOOD BOOK ABOUT A GREAT PITCHER,"THIS IS ABOUT WARREN SPAHN FORMER BASEBALL PITCHER FOR THE BRAVES. THIS BOOK IS BOTH AN EASY AND INTERESTING READ. IT DEALS MOSTLY WITH WARREN'S CAREER AND TOUCHES A BIT ON HIS PRIVATE LIFE. HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST WHO REALLY NEVER GOT THE FULL CREDIT HE DESERVED. AMONG HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE, WINNING 20 GAMES AN AMAZING 13 TIMES AND HIS LIFETIME TOTAL WINS OF 363 WHICH CAME WHEN HE REACHED THE MAJOR LEAGUES AT THE AGE OF 25. EVEN THOUGH THIS BOOK IS ONLY 158 PAGES IT CONTAINS ALOT OF INFO. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS."
4,"Performs well, but shave could be closer.",Shaver works well and charges fast. I am a little disappointed in the closeness of the shave and that it is not adjustable. Cleaninf is very convenient. Just open it up and rinse the blades and foil under running water. But beware. You have to leave the head open for drying. The 2nd time I used it the head had an odor like stinky feet. That was because I closed the top. I looked to the instructions and found that they recommend leaving it open until it dries. The stand is a little bulky for travel but all-in-all this is a very nice shaver.
3,Misleading Advertising,"I think that democracy might come to Iraq before this reconditioned Panasonic razor is shipped. The advertisement states that this item is shipped in one or two weeks. My order was placed on March 12 or nine weeks ago. Panasonic razors are usually excellent, but you might look like a mullah before this item arrives."
3,"Disjointed at times, but affecting","There seemed to be several different novels within this one book, which I suppose is expected, given the structure of the story. I found the beginning, about Grey's childhood, wonderful; the middle sections I thought were uneven. Details about 14th century life were interesting and eye-opening, but the seemingly endless chapters set in the Monastery became tedious to me. Once Grey became a mother, the story took off again.SPOILER-- the final sections were probably the most visceral and powerful reading I've done on what it must feel like to lose a child. In contrast to (in my opinion) rambling sections earlier in the book, the last part of the novel was tight, heartbreaking and beautiful."
4,A marvellous representation in music of the love of God.,Christian theology has misrepresented the concept of God for close to 2000 years now. We have a God that has rules; requires obedience; and takes vengeance on people who fail to observe the rules. This is rubbish. This album is inspiring primarily because it is not garish; nor loud; nor obnoxious. It conveys to the listener a quite strength. It says that God is there; holding your hand and will never abandon you. It is too bad that the Church does not do the same.
5,Outstanding!!!,"This album is outstanding, especially considering this is John's solo debut. To give this album anything less than five stars is insane. I realize that this review is not going to be helpful to anyone, but I've run out of clever and interesting things to say. 0 out 5 people found this review helpful. Just go buy this album. IT ROCKS!!! Great instrumental guitar album for musicians and non-musicians alike. Petrucci RULES!!!"
3,Doing what you know best too often,"Anything by Petrucci or his band is assuredly a full-packaged affair, crammed to the brim with tricky compositional maneuvers and creative soloing that is near-unrelenting, so it is with some hesitation that I must categorize this work yet again into the ambitiously bland department."
2,Super Guitarist under achieves,"JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored 'shred' albums of the eighties.The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!Both Joe Satch and Steve Vai are referenced heavily in JP's playing, (no bad thing, every guitar player is influenced by somebody), but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow.As far as I am concerned, it is unimportant if a guitar player of JP's calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes, so long as a)he has something to say and b)he says it with his own voice. JP fails to achieve this here.In summary: JP is awesome but fallible, he's only human after all."
3,Informative,"Just finished this book. I'm not a huge Dexys fan, but have a couple of their CDs. Their music takes me back to high school. Very nice book."
5,A really nice sampling of music...,"I've had this album for over ten years, when I bought it in college. The Cambridge Singers are a remarkable group. I bought the album for the madrigals, but have really enjoyed all the songs at one time or another, though I don't always listen to the album straight through. One song I had never heard before listening to this cd was ""To Be Sung Of A Summer Night On The Water I"". It is a beautiful,lush piece of music with a bit of a surprise ending.This album is especially good listening if you aren't in the mood to concentrate on just one type of choral music for an hour. However, I find myself wanting to purchase other Cambridge Singers albums because this is a bit of a ""teaser."""
2,Wondering if actually an EX,"I read the mixed reviews here on Amazon and figured why not try it. Alot of EX lenses produce great pictures. I took a few hundred pics and as said in other reviews the results were dissappointing. Some pictures turned out sharp and in focus however the majority of them were soft and unuable. I downloaded a calibration sheet and tested all of my lenses. All of my nikon lenses focus point were dead on, however the sigma always focused 3mm short leaving the focus point soft and unsharp. Yes you could crank up the f-stop to eliminate the softness, like a f/ 5.6 but whats the point. I have a cheap nikon D that will shoot @ that range easily and very well. The whole point of buying a f/ 2.8 is so you can shoot @ 2.8 in low lighting and when wanting a shallow depth of field."
1,Super soft focus. Blurry on edges even with smaller f-stops,"I returned this lens after one week. This lens had a very soft focus on my D80. The more pictures I took, the less I liked this lens. I tried this to take in door and outside pictures, both with poor results. The center sometimes would be almost sharp, but the edges showed distortion. I tried everything from shooting in a smaller aperture, manually focusing, and shooting on a tripod, I just couldn't get this lens to take a tack sharp picture. I think this lens may work for portaits because the bokeh is very soft, but I would worry that the image would not be sharp."
4,good product at the right price,"All of these adapters worked, and i got the bundle for far cheeper than individual prices."
1,Just Say No to SF Planet,"I have ordered products from SF Planet. The original didn't work and they sent a replacement that failed. They then would do nothing because the ""original order"" was over 6 weeks old. Amazing. I guess that's how they ""get you"" ... on a technicality or worst ... they have a stock of bad products that only last a few WEEKS and when the first fails, they send another dud. I highly recommend not ordering ANYTHING from SF Planet."
5,FINALLY on DVD!!!!,"""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"" has been one of my favorite horror movies for as long as I can remember. It's almost as if you're not watching a movie, but your inside the head of someone who isn't sure of what is real and what isn't. Early '70's horror doesn't get any better than this. An added touch for me is that this was filmed in my home state, and I often visit many of the filming locations, including driving by the ""old Bishop place"", as it is on a main route going to the shoreline in Connecticut. I long to creep up those stairs......"
2,"Oh, Good. When are you going to start?","More haunted house fun as a group of people are haunted by the eerie presence of Ingmar Bergman. 'Hour of the Wolf' had been released something like three years before and I suspect the director was a fan. British viewers of a certain age may also be minded of those BBC 'Ghost Story For Christmas' adaptions of MR James's stories. Unfortunately, the director has neither the budget or sureness with actors to pull of his warped premise. Despite some risible moments and the unnecessary early flyposting of the plot at an antique dealers, any film that pokes fun at the vulnerability of the hippy philosophy can't be all bad.(Undead, and can't cross running water? Grab a snorkel! Okay, so it's cheating but why should you care, oh deceased one?)"
5,A REAL HORROR MOVIE,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Wonderfully atmospheric horror flick from 1971 features a great setting, great oddball characters, and an altogether eerie mood to it. It may appear somewhat strange to the younger generation who are so used to the overblown special effects in today's horror films, but it is definitely worth a look...especially in a large, dark house all by yourself."
4,marie clare costello rocks....,"this creeped me out when i was a kid and thats the reason i fell in love with this film. sure its not the scariest or the darkest but it has the ""IT"" factor, and that it factor was the performance of ""emily bishop"" by marie clare costello. journeyman actress usually appearing in various bit roles in film and tv. BUT i feel that this was her magnum opus. she played the part perfectly, she was the very reason this film was as creepy as it was. the rest of the cast was great as well, i mean there was a little cheese here and there but it was 1971. cant make a movie from that era without some cheese....overall i highly recommend this movie for two main reasons.....first is the performance of emily by marie clare costello and number two the sound of this movie is by far the creepiest you will ever experience...."
3,What's it All About Jessie,OK mild horror worth watching if you 'collect' this type of movie. I'm glad I have seen it. But would never consider watching it again. The photography is excelllent as is the dvd's quality.
1,bad in this time or before,A cheaply made and very poorly acted movie.Forget finding a lost gem here..The movie is not scary nor interesting .
1,ugh.....,I decided to try this movie based on all the good reviews and I was sorely disappointed. The acting was horrible and seemed like it lacked any sort of emotion and because of this; I never cared if Jessica was going crazy or if the vampires existed. I don't mind 70's movies and I don't mind movies that are a bit slow; but this one seemed to move at a snail's pace.
2,disappointing movie,"If you are a horror film lover this movie is not for you, it was so boring, I kept waiting for it to be over, there are other greats on the market don't let the title fool you."
2,Seriously Stupid,"I love 70's horror movies like the exorcist and The Changeling. This movie is so stupid, I turned it off half way through. It's poorly acted and not in the charming way that so many older movies are either. I would suggest renting it before you buy. I just don't know what other reviewers saw in this."
3,"Dated, Atmospheric Mystery","A dated, but atmospheric horror film that draws you in primarily due to the protagonist Jessica, played by Zohra Lampert. Ghosts, graveyards, vampires, manipulation, and murder are all here in this small northeastern town and leave you rooting for the heroine in this pre-feminist era film."
2,Disappointment,"I was expecting it to be scary, richly textured and ambient. However, the low budget quality of the film creates many boundaries. Something as simple as the lack of makeup on any of the actors is...distracting. This movie is not compelling and is not scary. The story is predictable. This is not a movie you ""think"" about after you watch it. I would recommend this only to those who love the genre."
2,Girls Going Nowhere,"I had high hopes for this because the four protagonists are all lively and intelligent creatures. The plot proceeds to see them abused emotionally, sexually and intellectually. Abortion, typhus, murder, rape, thwarted ambition, its all here. Plus it is difficult to tell two of them apart and to keep their exploitive families straight. War is hell."
4,LOTNA vintage story,"Romance, adventure, history, and a sharing of Polands bravery comes to life in this film. Lotna, the star horse, gives a small view of the importance of the Polish Cavalry, and a special horse that fights the noise, shell fire, etc. while carrying his master. You will be angered at the cheated love between a young soldier and his new bride, as war is the terminator and the spectre of death follows even the bravest of men and women. I found the film provocative in the sense that it adds another dimension of how Polish life was affected during WWII. A film with few words, but moving scenes, some pastoral and some war maddened. Lotna will appeal to those who love horses, and will perhaps chuckle as to how this horse is part of the Polish Estate."
2,"How fast can we play Freight Train, boys?","This album is tiresomely the same very fast tempo, track after track, so much so that the music gets lost. I'll be putting this one directly into a donation box -- it gives me no peace but rather irritates me, and that's not what I'm looking for in this kind of music. All flashy technique -- no musicality. If you're interested in hearing flat-picking beautifully done, try Wayne Henderson's Made and Played album instead."
5,Good job!,"Spinning Through the Universe is a great book. It shows readers that not everyone has a perfect life. It shows different personalities from different points of view. We are 5th graders. We know what 5th graders are like. We think this is a great book for us to read. It is interesting, and it is beautiful. We like the poetry directions in the back."
5,Extremely Beautiful Music,"Stillness And Sweet HarmonyIt's like Gregorian Chants with added harmony. Very impressive, and a joy to listen to over and over again."
2,Excessive Volume,"The first two-thirds of the book is an extended, strident, rant on all the vile evils of all forms of investment other than index funds. While the information on the drawbacks and imperfections is mostly accurate (and mostly well known), the authors are unwilling to just present it clearly - they insist on beating you over the head with it.The authors are pure deciples of the strongest version of Modern Portfolio Theory. Untroubled by the reality of frequent, serious mispricings in the market, they insist that is is impossible to make money buying individual stocks.They also ignore what I feel is the major drawback of index investing: it effectively forces you to take large positions in very large cap companies in whose future you may have serious doubts. Think about what's happened to the prices of GE, IBM, Intel, Microsoft and the money-center banks.There are many better, far less strident books that provide the same information."
5,"Escape High Broker Fees, Low Returns!","An eye-opening critique of the mutual fund industry's grip on the average American's investments. If we knew in the late 1990's what Mr. Baer and Mr. Gensler reveal in this book, most of us would have been far better insulated from the stock market meltdown that has battered so many portfolios. This book will appeal to anyone regardless of his or her level of interest in the stock market. It wades through all the Wall Streetspeak and misleading advertising that is meant to fool and dazzle us. A must read for anyone who wants to escape the world of high broker fees and commissions and low returns."
1,There are better books. Avoid this one.,Try Ben Graham's book Security Analysis or Brandes book on Value Investing.
4,Bias is showing,"I liked the book and generally agree with the index fund arguments.The chapter on social security privatization was completely one-sided and biased. It made me wonder what was missing from the rest of the book.A couple of questions were completely ignored in the social security analysis:1. What return are we getting on our current investment of tax dollars (ours and our employers)2. What can we reasonably expect given the reality of the demographics?3. How does this compare with what we could expect with our SS dollars invested in index funds?4. How have privatized systems in other countries worked?All of these questions were ignored in favor of a diatribe about keeping the fees out of the hands of wall street. I'd much rather have seen an analysis of the effect on my retirement. Reading this one-sided, biased chapter made me question their analysis in the rest of the book."
5,The PRODIGAL,A very well done '50's bibical movie.Ms.Turner...never looked better.The Scope of this movie was very well photograph.
3,The Prodigal,"Who did not like Lana? Robert Osborne seems to get weak at the knees when he mentions her name; I do too. Lana was unforgetable in 'Ziegfield Girl' especially when she walked down those stairs at the end. What can one say about 'The Prodigal'? I rushed to see it as a kid and thought it was great. With time, I appreciate that it is not one of her best, but no matter about the dreadful dialogue or the wooden performances, Lana lights up the screeen - be it small or large - just as well as she did in her heyday. Don't analyse it, just enjoy it.The Prodigal"
1,MGM reaches the nadir of tastelesness,"I rented this DVD from Netflix. I hadn't seen this film for many years. I guess I was a teenager when I first saw it back in the 1950's. The film is badly miscast: Louis Calhern as a high priest of Baal wearing a replica of the papal tiara, Edmund Purdom (where is he now?) as the prodigal son should have won a raspberry for his performance. And Lana Turner was much, MUCH too old to play a ""virginal"" high priestess of Astarte. After watching this film I came to realize how much more sophisticated films have become over the past fifty years. The film storyline was set seventy years before the time of Christ. Where were the Roman legions that dominated the middle east at this time? TThere are much better Biblical films to wile away one's time."
5,THE MARRIAGE MAKER-Ethan and Cleo-SPOILERS,Favorite scene with Cleo-Realizing the baby is sick and in the hospitalFavorite scene with Ethan-With the baby in the hospitalTogether-With the baby in the hospital
4,Very Useful,"I found this book very handy to have. I have two problems with it. I can't find listings in the book for table sugar and half and half. If it's there, I can't find it. ."
2,Just one major flaw...,"This book would rate a good solid four except for one BIG flaw. It has no index which makes it VERY annoying to find anything in it. Otherwise it covers a lot of ground and has calorie, carb, fat, sat. fat, sodium, and exchange listings for all the foods. Very nice. But had I known there was no index I would not have bought it. It's already collecting dust :-("
3,Old edition!,"I bought this from Amazon without realizing it was old--the third edition was already out and for sale on Amazon, too, but I missed that. Do not buy the second edition!! As soon as my shipment arrived I ordered the third edition and suppose I'll be sending this one back--as hassle. Wish they had made this more obvious!"
5,Excellent educational resource!,"An excellent, thorough, comprehensive guide to altar guild training and education. Well-organized and easy to use."
1,Junk...don't buy!,This product is total junk! We got one shelf up and it took a half an hour to do and even then it leaned toward the floor. These shelves were not meant to hold items with any weight to them. The PLASTIC shelves are poorly made and after putting one up we threw the other three away then decided to go to a home improvement store to by some real shelves. I thought that the $40 price tag meant that they would be more sturdy but I was wrong and won't make that mistake again.
4,does the job,"so these ledges do the job. they aren't made by wood, they are kind of plastic-like. BUT they do look like wood, and they are great for the visual aspect. they were easy to install and nice for small budget-high quality look."
4,Impressive Look,"I have had these shelves for a couple months now, and I do enjoy the look and feel of them. These are deffinately not plastic as was stated in someone elses review, they feel like a polished aluminum or some other metal. They were not difficult to mount, but the hardware for mounting built into the shelves is very thin, which is what truly limits the ammount of weight these shelves can handle. Mine did bend slightly away from the wall since I mounted to a non smooth plastered wall. I assume if you were able to mount it flush to the wall and tight enough the shelf edge itself would be able to counter the bending I experianced better.I would probably not expect to be able to go much over the weight limit set by the manufacturer, as the previously reviewer overlooked the clearly labeled weight limits of this item on amazon.All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with the product, though I have yet to find an actual use for the 2 smaller shelves."
2,"Look horrible, won't stay on the wall well","The plastic anchors that came with it kept breaking in half before I could even get them into the wall. Once I got the shelves on the wall, the wouldn't sit flush with the wall. They weren't even close to flush. 1 was hanging approximately 2 inches from the wall.I guess I also didn't realize exactly how small the actual ledges were. When I purchased the items, they didn't have the width of the ledge and how much weight each could hold under the Product Description portion of the page. But 4 inches really is 4 inches. But I could over-look that. And once I received it I found out the weight of each shelf. but because the shelf wouldn't even sit up against the wall properly, it couldn't even come close to holding half the weight recommending. Overall, I was very disappointed, and would not recommend, unless you can get them to look exactly like the picture, in which case you're better than I, and probably used items that didn't come with the shelves."
2,Not a perfect solution,"I bought a medium-sized AmeriBag bag because i've hurt my back a couple times recently with my traditional backpack. The bag was great for my back since it put almost no weight there.However, all of the weight was placed on one shoulder, and it was just too much. I don't think I carry all that much stuff around with me (a book, PDA, cell phone, wallet, mini umbrella, a couple pens, sunglasses, some ibuprofen, and the like). The heaviest individual item i have at any given time is usually my book.Unfortunately, the AmeriBag wasn't quite up to the task. I'm going to have to go back to a traditional two-shouldered backpack and will hopefully be able to find an ergonomic one. My shoulders just can't handle the AmeriBag!If you carry very little around, the AmeriBag will probably work out well for you."
3,Ok,"I bought this bag for when i go to San Francisco or on day trips. It is ok, It is larger than i thought. Lots of pockets and roomy inside, not too comfortable when you have a coat on and it is heavy when you have all your items inside purse. I have only used it once and i actually prefer to use my coach bag instead!!"
4,Nice light-hearted feel good chick flick,"Not something to be taken seriously ever...and her wardrobe is truly fabulous. BM had come a long way from her days as an actress in ""Clueless."""
2,Meh,"The movie was pretty dull and predictable. It seemed to take a long time to set up the plot and then rushed through it. There were some cute parts, it wasn't awful for free, but I don't think it is worth the 90 minutes of your time."
3,Enjoyable Offbeat Comedy,"An offbeat comedy treat that will entertain some viewers and annoy others. There are some enjoyable humorous scenes and some touching romantic moments but this movie is not for everyone.Brittany Murphy's performance is pretty good, but Matthew Rhys seems to shine more brightly in this talented but quirky ensemble cast. The chemistry between Brittany and Santiago Cabrera, while leading to a predictable outcome, is endearing and at times downright funny.Give this one a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised."
4,"Definitely more ""Love"" than ""Disaster""...","In a genre littered with hundreds of samey quickly-forgotten offerings of mediocre quality, this one differentiates itself surprisingly well. The story is older than Shakespeare: girl meets boy, boy likes girl, but the inevitable misunderstandings contrive to keep them apart until the end. Nothing new, but what raises ""Love"" from the crowd is both its shameless tongue-in-cheek manner and its distinctly British sensibility - as present in some scathingly hilarious dialogue. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, certainly, but if you're a fan of British (or just plan snarky) humour, and you enjoy movies that don't take themselves seriously, I can't recommend this one to you enough."
4,good movie,"Good movie..Its cute,funny and a good chick flick...I like Brittany Murphy so thats why I wanted to buy this movie and was happy that I did...Its a all around nice movie..."
4,Slow for the first 2/5ths or so and around there it picks up.,"This movie was great. Like the title says it totally takes a while to get moving, but once it does it gets hectic and you really start feeling for the characters. Acting-wise, things weren't bad, but I wasn't blown away either. Brittany stole the show as my favorite because she was quite charming a lot of the time with her dialogue but could be serious when called for too (R.I.P.). However, I could actually relate to Matthew Rhys' character's withdrawn-from-reality state of mind. His view and approach to relationships hit too close to home. I was rooting for him the whole time since he was the main underdog.All in all, I'm totally glad I used up an hour and a half of my life to watch this crazy movie. It was kinda dark, but not completely. I won't really give anything away because I want you to form your own opinions. I think it's worth watching though!4.2 stars."
2,super trite,This movie is terrible and at the end you will want an hour and a half of your life returned to you. Quite possibly with interest.
1,"Dull, and Brittany Murphy's British accent is so bad","I don't understand why it's set in London when the actress playing the leading lady can't even pull off a convincing British accent. And it's just so dull and boring. Not worth it, even though it's free with Prime."
1,Bloody Boring,"Everything is too forced! It would be difficult to TRY to be worse. I love Brittany Murphy (RIP), but this movie was tragic. The plot itself is boring and dull, the perspective of the movie changes several times, Brittanys character does not fit well into the mix (not even her not so wonderful faux ""accent"" or random Jackie O throwback waredrobe)... basically it's a big snoozer"
1,Garbage,Ignore all 4 star reviews. This movie goes nowhere. Seriously< i did not like it. Spending any more time on the review is throwing away useful time after wasted time.
1,Love and other disasters,"P. U. I couldn't get through the first 2 minutes of this. B Murphy used to be cute/sexy,,, now seems kinda anorexic...What a shame...."
1,Puke .. in .. my mouth,Wow um what else to say but the first four minutes made me disgusted enough to feel slightly ill. I guess the review has to be 20 words long and so I suppose I'll also add that this was horrible.
1,"Wow, Just Bad!","This movie does not contain the degree of wit and irony to pull off the whole ""we're talking about a movie within a movie"" concept.The American/British accent Murphy displays is covered up by the excuse ""she grew up in America,"" how opaque.Don't even bother."
5,Can't help that love/hate relationship with romantic comedies?,This movie is perfect! Wonderfully witty romantic comedy that constantly picks on the ridiculousness of the romantic comedy. Both a chick flick and a great guy comedy. And not what you'd expect from Brittany Murphy; a very welcome surprise.
3,Cute movie,"It's an okay movie. Very light. Not remarkable or memorable, just cute. If you're looking for a fluff piece, try this one."
4,Surprisingly Good,"It got panned when it first came out, don't listen to those reviews though. THis movie is really good and Brittany Murphy is stunning in it."
1,Really Bad,"Horrible movie; made myself sit through fifteen minutes, waste of time. Why this movie got almost 4 stars is beyond me. This movie should have just been called Disaster."
1,Dumb Movie,"What a dumb movie, horrible story line and pathetic acting . If you got 2 hours you would like to waste and you got nothing better to do in your life, then this is movie for you."
2,The DVD Cover is More Interesting than the Movie,"There's really no other way to sum it up, Red Hook is easily one of the least interesting horror movies I've seen in years. It's a scavenger hunt gone wrong, with a predictable ending. The writers attempt to misdirect the audience halfway through the movie to lead up to a twist ending, but they try a little too hard, making the conclusion obvious.The film's production quality is poor, and the directing is below average. The cast does a decent job, as most were relatively experienced television actors. I have no idea why the word ""unrated"" was thrown on the cover, as the kill scenes will only make the average horror fan yawn. The only reason I gave the film two stars instead of one was because I enjoyed the movie's score.I thought it was painfully boring, and not paying for to watch online."
3,"Good, but nothing I haven't seen before","Red Hook is, at best, a watchable Scream, I know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, type slasher movie, with a few flaws. I was surprised Red Hook was only 120 mins. in length, because I felt like it was 2 hours at the most. I was already thinking that they should've edited out the prolonged character/victim intros and just cut to the start of the scavenger hunt. It just dragged out even more when you already knew who the killer was (Yeah, I figured it out before the killing started, just like the rest of you). But the acting is good, the kill scenes are effective, though lacking any real ""guts"" for any respectable gore hound and has nice little pop soundtrack. Not really a bad effort, but just watchable, nothing memorable. The makers of Red Hook should really use this film as something to look back on, note the flaws, and if they're filming any more slasher films, improve on it if they desire to be successful in this already overstretched genre."
4,"Good, but not very academic","Episodes as the Tulip Mania, The South See Bubble, the Crash of 1929 are going to leave a permanent trace in financial science. So they deserve close investigation. The Author has achieved to make really a very interesting and vivid one. His ideas are very controversial, but exactly they make the book amusing. However, I haven't seen anywhere in the book a formula, integral, etc. Perhaps the purpose was to give more informal treatment of the bubbles phenomena, but it will be very interesting a formal one to be made in future by fitting concrete rational expectations models in the historical data.Vilimir Yordanov, Bulgaria"
2,"Good Topic, Poorly Written","I picked up this book with high expectations as the topic is very timely, the author has a good reputaiton, and given the size of the volume thought it would efficientyl get to the point.While the arguements made are important they are lost in a difficult ot read academic writing style. Hence while I did get the point, I didn't enjoy the process. The three events discussed, ""Tulipmania"", the ""Missiissippi"" and ""South Sea Companies"" are well know within financial circles. Each carries a lore and mythology which is what perpetuates them today. Humanizing the narrative would have been a more effective way to make the points that each had logical explnations other than manias that distorted asset prices.Finally, particularly as the author is works in contemporary finance, the book really should have a chapter on the lessons applied to today."
2,shattered bubble book,I did not finish this book entirely but I do not like it much. It is written as if it is a scietific study with al ot of references to books that may not be available anymore. It has no scientific value because it reworks the data of others and no new insights are gained.As an inforative book it misses anything that you can call a storyline. Only the part about the Mississipi bubble is readeable.
3,An adequate rendition-Buy it for City of London,"Belshazzar's feast is far more electric in the Previn RPO recording, but this is worth considering for the fine reading of the little recorded In Honour for the City of London. This work, much in the vein of the excellent Te Deum, has many moments of real invention, and is worth hearing more often."
4,Short and sweet. Nice buy for these pieces,"This is one of those CD's I search out off the beaten path, as it is 20th century (uncommon for biblical subjects), choral by a native British composer (an uncommon commodity in any century), and it includes material commissioned for a special purpose, in the 'In Honour of the City of London'. This CD is available for substantially less than other releases of the same works, and to my amateur ear, this performance is quite good, thank you. My only reservation, relieved quite a bit by the low price, is that it has less musical performance time than the average Classical CD these days. If you like 'old fashioned' rousing choral stuff in the tradition of Mozart's Requium, this is good listening."
3,"A little mistake, but it's settled; a good deal in general","I purchased this a week ago, and I guess it's because of an oversight of the seller, instead of getting six tubes, I just got one. After I emailed and contacted the seller, they sent me the rest five few days later. I thought I got cheated, but now I am happy with this resolution. Of course it could be better if they have sent me the right package from the very beginning, but it was settled well enough. $12 for six is indeed a very good deal.Something I don't like about the product, though, was that the tube did not fit in to my lamp very well. It frequently got loosen and so I have to use an adhesive tape to hold it in order for it to light. I don't know if it's the problem of the tube or my lamp, but other models don't seem to have similar problems.Besides all these, I think I am okay with this product."
4,The beginners choice.,Practice sections at the end of each chapter will really help the beginner to understand the Tarot. Nice layout also.
2,"""The average reader will find this novel tedious and insufferable""...","... says the defensive reviewer for Publishers Weekly, quoted here on Amazon. I like to suppose that I'm a more-than-average reader, at least in terms of grit and perseverance, but I tossed this tedious exercise in self-referential obscurantism after some twenty pages. It reeks of the kind of literary pomposity that saturates the Journal of the Modern Language Association. It's a title to flash at English department cocktail parties at universities in state capitals. And just for a point of reference, I've read Pale Fire, Ulysses, Nobodaddy's Children, A Personal Matter, and other 'difficult' novels. Nobel Prize or not, Claude Simon is no Nabokov."
4,Shin Guards,"These are great shin guards. The only trouble you may have is the size. There was no information on what size to buy included in the product posting. I guessed medium and lucked out that it was the right size for me. I am 5' 5"" and weigh 135 and these fit me perfect. They would be 5 stars if I had not had to guess the size."
4,Again get the 3 track + video version,"Much like the good people single, the EU version provides an extra song and a video compared to what is offered here on amazon.Breakdown is a perfectly good sing along song, very chilled and relaxed.Constellations is a lovely acoustic version of the album version with some nice guitar work from Jack.Girl I wanna lay you down is typical of Jacks arrangements with Zach Gill, a bit of keyboard and shared vocals, nice song.And again you get a video.Overall terrific single if you get the correct version."
2,If You Are New To The Business World,"If you are new to the business world this book might be helpful, but for someone like myself that has been in business for years, this is just basic business knowledge.This book was recommended to me to help me move up in my career, however, there is nothing new that Ms. Ruffino wrote that I already didn't know.She also seems to be lost in years of the male dominated business field because she concentrates on how to beat the males in many ways.If you know nothing about being a business woman, buy this book, but if you have been in the business world as long as I have, save your money.It is very dry and you will learn nothing new."
1,Nasty after-taste! This cocoa is truly bad.,"Ghiradelli has developed a name as producing high-quality chocolate products. But SORRY, in the case of this cocoa, the emperor has no clothes!I went to my local grocery, and since Ghiradelli hot-chocolate is one of the most expensive brands... I figured it was also going to be the best-tasting. Boy, was I wrong!This cocoa has a nasty after-taste. There is no smooth, chocolate flavor whatsoever. I threw out the entire container because I found it to be undrinkable.I would recommend just about any brand before Ghiradelli. I just don't understand the hype.Here are the hot-chocolate and cocoa brands I WOULD recommend: Marie Belle, GODIVA, and even ""Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf"" all make great-tasting hot chocolate/cocoas. Take it from a true CHOCO-HOLIC like me!"
4,Yum!,"This is my 2nd favorite flavor of Ghiradelli's hot cocoa mix! Tastes like a nice Mocha without too much caffeine for when I don't want actual coffee to keep me up all hours of the night. It does have coffee as an actual ingredient, but it's not enough to bother me at night."
3,Disappointed,"Maybe its me, this is the first Ghiradelli oocoa I purchased anywhere that tastes almost chalky, lacks sweetness and is an all around disappointment. Again this is within its selling deadline albeit on sale, taste is unpleasant and not suggested."
2,Not worth buying,It is a small can. It takes 4 tablespoons in milk to make an 8 oz. glass and it has an unpleasant aftertaste.
1,Not very much information in this tape.,"This tape also is sold under many different titles. Same tape just a different name.Too short, not worth buying."
4,Good remote,"I have used many universal remotes over the years (including most of the first universal remotes on the market many years ago), and I really like this remote. Screen resolution is OK, but otherwise no complaints. I had a problem with the remote, and Monster replaced it. I have since purchased a second remote."
4,Solid Unit That Cleans Up Remote Clutter,"I had to toss my Harmony 550 into the trash after numerous programming events that ended in frustration. I researched and was ready to order the Sony RM-AX4000 when I happend upon the Monster.This unit is nicely weighted and balanced. It is MUCH easier to read than the Harmony.Programming took less than 15 minutes once the online account was set up. My nine year-old has already figured out how the Monster records/watches shows on the PVR, and this from a kid who is limited to 60 minutes of TV per day.The tactile feel is excellent. I'm not crazy about the rechargeable battery/recharging base but if that is my only major compromise, it is acceptable.You will find the placement of buttons very well thought-out with the exception of the Channel/Volume up/down buttons. They are sideways! Up should be UP and down should be DOWN.The screens are easy to navigate and easy to read. I paid $159 on Amazon in Jan '08 and am very pleased with my purchase."
5,Fantastic Monster remote,"The Monster MCC AV100 remote control was easy to set up, is easy to use, and best of all,operates all my TV/video & stereo equipment from my new Sony plasma to my 20 year old Carver stereo components. I'm very pleased and would highly recommend it. And Amazon's price can't be beat."
1,Awful,"I've had this remote for a few years now and it might be the worst piece of electronic equipment I currently own. 2 major issues:1) There's a HUGE delay sometimes from the time you hit ""off"" until the time things actually turn off. So you have to sit there for about 7-10 seconds and just wait for it to work.2) Even more annoying, the remote *often* won't switch off all the equipment it's supposed to. So you end up hitting ""Help"" (again, there's a delay here too). Why? Why does hitting ""Help"" seem to work but the actual ""System Off"" switch doesn't?Don't waste your money."
3,Solid construction but results are mixed - no substitute for a smoker,"The construction of this box is solid. Yet, I can't seem to get results. Slow cooking meats on a gas grill with packaged mesquite wood chips and then apple wood chips from Charcoal Companion, generated a dense amount of smoke -- on my clothes, hat, in my lungs and my eyes. Yet, the taste was barely noticeable on the meat. This endeavor was definitely not worth the hassle. My wool jacket and Ben Sherman hat reeked of smoke for a week. Given the intense plume of rich smoke a small package of chips created, I am surprised the meat didn't absorb more of the flavor. My suspicion is that the conventional design of a grill is vastly inferior to a purpose-built smoker in that the former doesn't envelope the meat. Basic gas and even charcoal grills will have the flavorful smoke rapidly forced out by other hot gases. A true smoker will envelope the meat and then infuse it with the desired flavor."
4,Great Cast Iron Smoker Box,I saw it on Cook's County Cooking and it made good sense. It is kind of large for my small grill but works great!!!
5,Compact Smoker,"Well made cast iron, thin enough to place between grates and burner of Weber gas grills. Purchased for use in my LP fireplace to burn wood without the clean up of the fireplace. Small enough to be portable, large enough to to last for a few hours of use."
3,No Smoke!,We've tried on direct heat and on indirect heat; we've tried soaking the chips and using dry chips; we've tried high gas heat and low gas heat! No smoke. Bought different brand of chips - tried all the above - no smoke!
4,Smoke Box,"Two words, Cast Iron. It will last a life time this is my second one b/c I wanted to have more than one box going at the same time in my grill. It works pretty good to get some subtle smoke flavors in the food."
3,"with the cover ""locked in"".","wish the cover had ridges/grooves and locked in. it's still a good product, also wished that it was easier to remove the top to put more chips in it.not sure if would buy it again."
2,broken on arrival,"Though I expect the majority of these boxes are as durable as you'd expect, the one I ordered arrived with a large corner piece chipped completely off (note: the packaging was completely fine, so probably not damaged during shipping). Not a big deal, but it does call into question the real quality of the product. I'd expect cast iron products to be extremely durable (after all, this is one of their big selling points), but the one from GrillPro was not quite up to par. I'm sure that 95% of these boxes will outlast any grill they'll be used with,and will produce the same result as any other smoker box, but I was disappointed to get a broken one, and I was forced to go buy one at my local hardware store instead for the BBQ I had planned...just kind of an annoying setback. Of course, amazon handled the return and refund quickly and so it wasn't really a huge problem."
1,IT BROKE!!!!,"I have had this product since May 2011, and being solid cast iron, I thought it would be indestructible... today, I was preparing to barbecue, using the apple wood pieces in this smoker box. When I picked it up, the box was completely cracked in half. Sad to say, I am past my return window by a few weeks. I will still try to use it, since the broken pieces still fit together, but I am NOT happy!!"
4,GOOD PRODUCT,This item is exactly as promised. It works and you will not regret buying this item. I am an avid cook on the grill and in my estimation it works great.
4,Worth the money.,For use in a charcoal or gas grill for smoking 'meat' of any kind. Very well built and holds heat quite well. Place chips in box and place smoker box over indirect heat.
4,Upgrade to a cast iron smoker box,"The cast iron and heavy lid do a good job to reduce the airflow to the wood chips so you get more smoke than flame. I use this with my gas-fired smoker and it works well with the flame on low.After a couple weekends of using it, I will probably get another so I can swap out for new wood chips quicker and easier and let the box of coals cool down until it is safer to move around."
1,Don't waste the money on smoker boxes.,"I've tried at least 5 different type of smoker boxes for my gas grill. Stainless steel, rolled steel, ""V"" shaped that fits between the flame bars and now cast iron on the recommendation of ""Cook's Illustrated"" TV show. All gave only a small amount of smoke, almost all left a portion of the chips unburnt and all gave out quickly. I'm going to stick with my old method of soaking the chips, wrapping into a packet of heavy aluminum foil, and poke a bunch of holes in the top. Works better than any smoker box, lasting longer, and giving more smoke. I can always have a standby on hand to toss on the grill when the first one give out if I need more smoke."
2,Too smelly to use,"I was concerned about the strong chemical smell some other reviewers talked about, but I went ahead and ordered the mat anyway based on the other positive reviews. Unfortunately, the mat WAS extremely smelly and the smell didn't go away even after I unrolled the mat and aired it out in the basement for two days. I am returning the mat."
4,works great,I bought this for my husband since he was doing P90X. It works great for him. He uses it on our carpet to keep from slipping and sweating on my floors! Rolls up nicely and stores away each day.
4,Good Mat for P90X,"I use this mat for P90X workouts and it's great. Slips a little bit on wood floors (nicely waxed ones that is). Didn't have any smells or any problems like that.Even use it for the Yoga X workout and it's just fine.Provides enough cushion, I do all my workouts barefoot so its a big plus. If you need it for p90x or those type of workouts, this is great."
3,Slip N Slide,"If you perspire at all while working out (which EVERYONE does) this otherwise comfortable exercise mat turns into a Slip-n-Slide. There is absolutely no traction. You will be required to wipe it down repeatedly. If you don't, you may seriously hurt yourself."
2,Dont be tricked by the good reviews,I was very disopointed when this arrived it is a poor quality mat and will not stay in place it slips very easy and does not offer much of a cushion the material is awful it is way over priced. It should be sold in the dollor tree for a buck I would look elsewhere if you want a good yoga/workout mat. Only good thing I will say is I like that you can roll it back up easy
3,"Eh, OK.","This item is comfortable but sticks to itself and remains in its shape after being unraveled. Thus, it does not sit flat on the floor but is rather rolled up at the edges. Also, the material it is made of makes unpleasant noises often when shifting position. The straps are nice but this item wasn't was as expected and not worth the money in my opinion. I would go with the more tradition yoga mat if I had another choice, and they can be found at about half the price."
3,Good mat overall for the price,"This is the first exercise mat I've ever bought (and probably used for that matter) so I don't have much to compare it to. But I started P90x a few weeks back and wanted to buy a cheap mat to use with it.I was a little nervous when 5 minutes into my first exercise with the mat I made a little surface tear in the mat with the sole of my sneaker. At that point I thought the thing was going to rip in two by the end of the first workout. However, it has stood up well over the month or so I've had it. There are a few little surface nicks and marks etc. that I've made, but it doesn't seem to be any worse than that.As for the smell.....it's gotten better but still pretty evident.Overall, for the price I think it's a decent product. Again, I have nothing really to compare it to but overall I would say it's worth the $$."
4,Nice mat!!,"This is my first exercise mat. So I wont be the most qualified reviewer, but it is definitely better than working out without a mat. It is also better than the ones I used during yoga class at work. So, I am liking the mat so far. Tonight, I plan to do some plyometrics on it for the first time. Thus far, I have only done an ab workout. I might have more to say about the mat after more use."
5,What else did you expect?,"It's a mat, it gets the job done and easy to roll up and hide away unlike other mats I have used."
2,Do not buy for P90X or anything where you can't have the mat sliding around`,"The mat itself has a nice feel to it but it stretches a lot so if you are trying to do any form of yoga, sphinx pushups, etc it will keep stretching (immediately, not over time) until you have bad form. It also slides around on the floor easily because it's not tacky at all. So you cannot cannot do jumping at any angle at all on this or you will be on your butt on the floor. Nice thickness but too stretchy and slippery. Not safe for P90X."
2,Compact,"This mat is easy to take with you and to store in your home. The very annoying thing about this mat is that it tends to curl on one of the ends, which is annoying especially if you are tall and need to use the whole mat to exercise on."
4,Oily smell,"I just received this mat and it seems to emit an oily smell at times. Also smells like an electric fire at other times. However, i've had it for a week and the smell has subsided a bit. Other than that it is a perfect mat for exercise."
4,Great mat for the price,"Okay, so it smells a little. I was a little concerned since some of the comments say the smell never leaves, while other said it's fine after a few days. Smell was bad, but after a few days of being aired out, it's fine.I'm only beginning and I got the mat because my feet kept slipping on the carpet, even with shoes on, I can't believe how much difference a mat makes. I wish it was just a little wider, but I'm 6'3"" and it's plenty long for anything I'm doing. I wanted the thickest mat out there and this one is 3/8"" instead of the 1/4"" most others.It's a manly black color, it keeps me from slipping, padding is fine, stores well, the smell went away after a few days and good price. Yeah, it's made in China, but what are you going to do? -1 star for the odor, even if it does go away after a few days, it's still kind of there and I can understand if some are more sensitive than others."
3,Will it ever unroll???,"Yea, it's a mat. The most annoying thing is that the end inside the roll will simply not straighten out. Maybe after a few months it will. Also, the roll straps get in the way of my workout. Would go with a different product if I could do it over again."
4,does the job,"I am pleased with this mat, however it is a bit ""mushy"". Some people might prefer a stiffer foam. I use this with P90X, and it does what I need it to do"
2,Not durable,"If you use shoes at all during your workout, this is not the mat for you. I used shoes once on it while doing plyometrics and now there are several large chunks missing out of it. Also, I workout on a linoleum floor and any moves that require you to be up on elbows or knees are painful as the mat is not dense enough to support you and you can feel the hard ground underneath (I weigh 200lbs). When doing yoga, any pose such as warrior where your feet are spread apart will stretch the mat. There is 6+ inches of stretch when in any warrior pose and it makes for a pretty unstable base. I ended up buying a $15 more expensive, dual density, slip resistant mat that is so much better."
3,"Good, but not made for Hot Yoga classes!","This mat is comfy, but it has 2 major flaws if using it for Hot Yoga.1. It is slippery when wet - and I mean extremely slippery!2. It slips all over the wooden floor as puddles of sweat can easily gather.If your intent is to use this for Hot Yoga, I'd recommend going for the Manduka mats. I had to give it away after just ONE use."
1,Harbinger Exercise Mat,This exercise mat is very flimsy and had a rubber smell so bad that I couldn't leave it in the house.
4,Makes working out a LOT more comfortable...,"I had recently started working out, and realized that my flimsy yoga mat really wasn't supporting me when I was working out on the ground. I found this Harbinger mat, and I bought it because of how thick it is. I must say it really feels great! Doing crunches, other matwork, and pilates is so much easier using this mat. I've noticed that I'm not as tired at the end of the workout. The only thing that bugs me about it (and it's not a big deal) is that it kind of sticks to your skin, especially bare feet. Once you get used to that, it's not a problem. To make a long story short, this mat is great!"
3,Not so comfy,"I bought this item due to the mostly positive feedback. After using it for 2 weeks or so, I found it to be not as soft as some thought. Frankly I didn't feel much comfort at all. As per the smell some people had, mine has no odor."
4,Happy with it.,I'm satisfied with my purchase. Some people complained about the smell but I dont really smell anything. The thickness is great. It's quite comfortable. I just wish that it was wider. The length is good for me though. I enjoy doing sit-ups and push-ups on it without hurting my back and hands. I would definitely recommend this product.
3,good quality mat but too thick to use,brought this for my wife who goes to the gym for yoga classes. This mat was too thick for use and harder to carry around. Quality of the mat was great though if you need it for home gyms
5,Satisfied,I was looking for a mat that had enough padding so when I did sit ups it wouldnt hurt my lower back and this is exactly what i was looking for. Shipping was fast as usual with prime so over all very happy
4,Good but not Great,I like the length and texture but I feel like I got to be careful cause it may tear easily
1,Garbage mat,"It won't lay flat if you keep it rolled up. Also it's non slip.... as long as you don't sweat. As soon as your hands and feet sweat, it's like you're trying to do yoga on a wet tile floor."
2,Not for my use,I would not recommend this product to use with any aerobic activity. Mat slips on all surfaces and will not stay in place.
3,its ok,"Gets the job done perfectly but it wont win a beauty contest. This smell that someone complained about goes away if you leave it unrolled for a few days. Its too long though, About a foot and a half to 2 feet longer than it should be. Damn is it ugly though..."
1,Extremely Strong Smell,The mats had an extremely strong chemical smell. The smell was so bad it made us feel nauseous and we had to get rid of them.
3,"Soft, Good Traction, But Sheds","This mat by Harbinger is soft and provides great traction. I use it for doing yoga (even though they suggest a thin matt), as well as for plyometrics. When doing plyometrics or any other activity that involves jumping, etc. it's very important to have a mat that softens impact and saves your knees. Often, the problem with these sorts of mats is that they lose the traction quality of the thinner mats. This mat does both! However, if you're sweating and you like to work out with your shirt of you may be displeased by the fact that this mat lightly sheds its black material."
2,not as great as I had hoped,"The mat provides a nice cushion, however, it rolls up at the end which is annoying, since I can trip over it as I exercise. Also, if you are not in a rush to buy it, shop around at TJ Maxx or Marahalls, as they will likely have something like it at a much reduced price."
4,Colleen,Timely delivery. Mat itself is great for Yoga and floor activities. I like that I can roll it up for storage when not in use however there is this irritating velcro on one side and if flipped to the bottom side for my comfort the matt (once rolled and holding its shape some) does not lay flat. I hope with time this works itself out.
3,Does the job,"I have been using this mat for close to 8 weeks now. Here's my take. This mat is ideal for less vigorous excersices such as yoga and provides a stable grip. Its also good for ab workouts as it provides good cushioning for the back. But for vigorous excersices such as plyometrics or anything that involves jumping around the mat slips and slides. (I have hardwood floors, no idea about carpeted). The mat does get slippery if you sweat on it (found this out when I was doing push-ups). So make sure that you keep an extra towel in handy to wipe the sweat off the mat. Overall its a decent mat for the price and ideal for yoga or any other low impact excersice."
3,Not bad,It is a little too thin but at least it is compact and helps keep me off the dirty floor. I can bring it anywhere. I use a velcro strap on it to keep it bundled up tight.
3,"Good, but not great","Length and padding are nice but after just a few months, small chunks of the foam surface are coming off. Other reviewers had commented that it was slippery when wet and I've found the same thing. Definitely want to put a towel on this. For the price, it's a decent choice."
3,Mat torn,The mat arrived with a 4 inch tear along the edge. I will surely rip this thing to shreds - I am in the middle of a program and need some mat so I cannot return - but this will be trash in a few weeks.
2,"Too narrow, won't stay flat.","First, it's 22-1/2"" wide, not 24"". Makes a difference, it should have been specified correctly. Second, ends still curl up after leaving open on the floor for 24 hours with some weights on the ends to keep it flat. Third, it doesn't feel sturdy enough to withstand vigorous exercises. It is like a cushion, missing its shell. However, I didn't get the stench as other reviews complained."
3,It's a mat,"It serves its purpose for some exercises. I wish it was a little thicker but folding the end over to double or triple the thickness works for exercises that require knee contact. Smell was no issue after two days. Cosmetically it will get dinged up and abraded with use. But then again, it's a mat."
3,overall decent at a very good price.,love it! i just dont like the fact that when your sweating profusely the mat becomes silppery. other than that a great workout mat very comfortable and great back support. it also doesnt feel like your sitting on the ground.
5,Very comfortable,"I'd let this mat 'air out' in a remote place for a couple days since it smells heavily like rubber. After the 'smell' is gone, it is a great mat with lots of padding and good grip from both sides. Rolls up and is secured by Velcro straps for storage or taking with."
4,Not bad,"This is a good mat for the price. However, there's a couple of negatives I've found in my own use of it. First, during vigorous exercise on a wood floor, the mat tends to move around a lot. It may have better holding power on a carpeted floor, but it slips and slides a bit on wood. Second, when doing extreme workouts or when it's really hot out and you're perspiring more than usual, the moisture on the mat turns it into a skating rink. Be careful. I keep an extra towel handy to keep the mat dry.It is very comfortable and appears to be durable. My mat had an initial newly-manufactured smell, but it was slight and went away very quickly.Again, the price is great and the overall quality is good."
3,Strong Chemical Smell,"Although the thickness/cushioning was great on this mat, I gave it away to charity because even after owning it for several years the strong chemical smell never went away."
4,Pretty Pleased,"I purchased this mat for P90X after realizing my carpet wasn't padded enough. So far, it has been perfect. At first it seemed a little thin, but has provided me with enough extra padding to be comfortable (or as comfortable as you can be with P90X). There was no trace of any odor coming from the mat, so I don't know if previous posts were a bad batch or something that spilled on them or what, but mine is odor free. If you need a little extra padding for comfort, I would recommend this mat, especially for the price."
2,Really does smell,"Pew! People really weren't joking about the smell. I read about it before buying and figured the complaints were just from health nuts who were being overly sensitive, but no. It really does stink. I keep it in my small laundry room and every time I open the door I'm hit with its chemical odor. So if you're going to buy this, know that you can't store it in any room where people live, or any closet where you keep clothes or anything you don't want to pick up a stench.Otherwise it's a fine mat. A bit stretchy, but fine."
3,Very thick and slippery,"I'm no yoga master, but I think there have to be better offerings than this. If you're working out on concrete and really can't handle a thin mat, this might be a good option, but just consider yourself warned that this mat is very slippery when you're sweaty. I sweat very efficiently, and I have to put a towel down just to hold myself in place during certain workouts. Given that this mat was more expensive than many others, I'm a little disappointed with its performance from that perspective. That said, this mat is so thick it could also double as a thin camping mattress/pad. So, maybe I am really getting my money's worth. :)"
2,Strong Smell!,"This mat is great except for the strong chemical smell. It was so strong when I received it that I unrolled it and hung it outdoors for two weeks. Even after that, I could still smell it in the room where it was stored. I don't know what it's made of, but it off-gasses for a long, long time.For floor work it's comfortable and I like that it can be rolled for carrying. I don't store it rolled because the odor intensifies so much when it's rolled. I wouldn't buy another one just because of the overpowering smell, and I am not a person who is overly sensitive to odor."
2,"Good cushion, too stretchy","Nice soft cushion, but the mat stretches when you use it for certain exercises. When doing push-ups, for example, your hands stretch the mat away from your feet out of the intended position. Many exercises and yoga moves are more difficult on the mat because of the stretching. The mat also slides around on hard floors too easily for my tastes."
1,Smells Really Bad,A nice mat except for the smell. Very strong chemical smell to the point I had to put it in a plastic garbage bag. I would not recommend it for that reason. Too many other good mats in this price range that do not have this problem. Sorry I bought it.
2,Slips too easily,"This mat is very cushy, and would probably work well on a carpeted floor. I have tile floors, however, and bought this mat to use with P90x. It slips all over the floor, and stretches with my body when I'm holding simple yoga poses like downward dog. It feels like it's going to rip very soon. Don't buy this if you have hard floors or if you're using it for yoga alone. I'm going to go buy a new mat tomorrow and throw this one away."
2,adequate but would be better if covered with fabric,The one I had before had a cover making it more comfortable and washable.It's sticky and also dents easily.For the price it's basically a foam mat.
4,First yoga mat and so far no complaints...,Been using it regularly and the only thing i advise is to wipe off the sweat when done with your session to avoid funk or anything else thats nasty
1,22 DAYS,22 days later and i still haven't gotten the harbinger mat. the mat is probly pretty good i wouldnt know since the company never shipped it to me. they emailed me the past week saying they will ship it blah blah blah got another one today saying next week told them to cancel it. don't buy from company they obviously aren't professionals.
2,DRIBBLE!!,"Ever heard the term ""stream of consciousness""? Basically, it means the author started writing whatever came to mind and just kept on writing - no rhyme or reason to any of it. Well, that's how I would describe Pandora. I was thoroughly disappointed. I can only hope that this book was a necessary intro to more to come. Maybe it's one of those books you have to read twice to understand - I don't know. I DO know that I didn't like it the first go round. Rice's last couple of books seemed like an attempt to fulfill a contract and sadly, this one is in the same category. I expected a LOT better."
2,This book is terrible...,"Again I'm dissappointed with an Anne Rice novel. The first vampire chronicles were fabulous, I couldn't put them down and have never tired of reading them. Pandora, on the other hand, really was a waste of money. I kept reading to the end just in hopes of finding a really good part. The good part was actually finishing the book, never to pick it up again. The history was incredibly boring. This was one of Anne's worst yet."
2,manages to make a fascinating time period boring,"I haven't read much Ann Rice and judging from this book I haven't missed anything. I slogged through half of it before giving up in ennui. Some of her insights and narrative devices were interesting, but it was all bogged down in leaden prose."
4,"Quick, fun, adventurous","Pandora is Anne's best book since Memnoch. The world of Pandora is opened to us and what a place it is. Pandora is action packed and filled with ancient history which makes it not only a pleasurable read, but a brief history lesson as well. The style is typical of the Chronicles, but it's done well in this short form.I hope Armand can live up to the accomplishments in Memnoch."
4,"Intrigueing, yet bogged with history","Well, in the past 5 months I have fully imersed myself in Rice's writing. After reading Armand & being slightly let down (guess nothin' can live up to its hype) & reading Pandora as more of an obligation, I found myself enjoying it completely. It could have done with out all the historical referances (I don't know history & wouldn't have been able to tell the differance if they weren't there)& other than Pandora becoming a zealot almost immeditly after becoming a vampire, I was suprised & delighted."
4,Mesmerising - Spectacular - Enchanting,"Reading Pandora - The New Vampire Chronicle not only keeps you captivated but shed new light to the whole chronicle. Not only Ms Rice, brings to fore a new hero, Pandora, she also manages to keep readers entertained till the very end. And now, after acquiring The Vampire Armand , I just can't wait to read more of Ms Rice's work. Thank you Ms. Rice for an entertaining 1998 - May God bless you."
2,"not the best she can do, I hope","This is my first experience with Anne Rice's books, and from this experience, I recommend that this is not the book that first-time Rice readers should start with. The story and writing was pretty basic leaving much to be desired, and frankly, I thought the story much more interesting before she became a vampire. I am a fan of Dracula and vampire tales in general, so if anyone has any suggestions as to which Rice novel might be a better starting point suggestions would be welcome."
3,Not one of Anne's best,I was overjoyed to find the book but was rather disappointed by the actual content. What was there was gripping but I felt that I was waiting for something more to happen. The book ended far too soon. The historical content was interesting but the actual Vampire content was limited to say the least. I look forward to reading the next in the series and hope it's more fulfilling!
5,Wow! Stunning.,"Not since her INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE have I been so enthralled by one of her books. I didn't put the book down until I finished it. After her recent bores, it is nice to see Anne Rice is back. And so are her vampires!"
3,A disappointment,"Pandora falls short of the first Vampire books with their lush and evocative prose. The storyline and setting are compelling, but Pandora fails to be that interesting."
1,Please STOP carbon copying your books!,"Having always been a fan of the Vampire Chronicles, I was very hesitant about reading about Pandora's story. After trying to read the trash that was the Violin, and being disapointed with the book on Armand, I was almost dreading what Anne was going to do to Pandora. I shouldn't have bothered. She didn't make it into a horror fest like the Violin, or leave me bored as with Armand, no she told a similar story as that of Armand and Marharat and her twin. Anne Rice has lost her character's individualness that was so unique. Please stop belting them out for your publisher, Anne. Return to basics, we know you can do it, perhaps then we can recover from The Violin, Pandora, Memnoch, and Armand. Ugh."
3,It was okay,"Pandora is evil, and I liked it. it was kind of long and a bit boring, until things get heated. So it's a worthy read."
5,Exceptional historical novel.,"The ""autobiography"" of the Vampire Pandora, who has appeared in ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" as a minor character, is a fascinating look at the life of a woman in ancient Rome. It bears some stylistic similarities, and some similarities of plot and character, to the ""Cynthia, Witch of Syracuse"" stories of Dorothy J. Heydt that appear in Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""Sword and Sorceress"" series, but it is hardly derivative. There are also some similarities between the character of Pandora and that of Olivia, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's vampiric ""childe"" of Saint Germain. This book is delightfully well-written, and is a pleasure to read on many levels: powerfully moving story, interesting historical perspective, compelling philosophical insights, and fascinating characters. One of Anne Rice's best-written vampire novels."
5,Ann Rice Excellence,Excellent Ann Rice. Enjoy all of her Vampire series. Descriptive and in depth with her writing. You will enjoy it if you like Vampires.
3,Not one of her better books,"I have been an avid reader of Rice's since the publication of Interview With the Vampire. This venture into other characters is timely, exploring characters which have only been names mentioned in the Vampire Chronicles. Rice's descriptions are, as usual vivid and sensual, evoking an entire world in one paragraph. However, I'm beginning to feel that Rice is taking herself too seriously. Her characters lecture UNcharacteristically, and in this book, she seems to be equating female independence with wanton promiscuity. I feel Rice has always had problems writing strong female characters. This is a good story, though, and if you possess the other Vampire Chronicles, you should add this one to the set."
3,Not Ann's best.Loved the charactersEnding cries for a sequel,The chacters were typically engrossing.The plot flowed like a magic carpet.But the ending was endless and cries for a sequel.
2,Just not up to scratch,"As a keen reader of Rice's vampire novels, I waited in anticipitation for this one. However, the tale lacked the intense passion and action of the origional vamipre cronicles. Too much background completely obiliterated what could have been a great story. Which is not to say that what was written was not fascinating on one level, but it simply did not live up to the earlier novels achieved - to shed a whole new light on vampires and the passion contained within their lives. Perhaps only so much can be said?"
4,Highly enjoyable and hard to put down,"Yet another intelligent and suspenseful tale by Anne Rice. However, I felt there could have been some minor improvements in the ending."
3,Not my favorite,"I love Anne Rice, so don't get me wrong, but this was not her best story. It starts out a bit scatter brained on Pandora's part so I found it a little hard to follow until it really got into the story. I guess I was just expecting to read about happenings between Pandora and Marius, or Pandora and her Asian vampire that she spent a great deal of time with, but there isn't any of that really. You are basically reading a few new things from Pandora's point of view during Roman times; it doesn't go past that age much. I still liked it because it was Anne Rice, but it was definitely not my favorite of her work. It's a short story so it's not like it will be a complete waste of your time if you like Anne Rice."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"I have no idea why there has to be New Tales of the Vampires, when this book seems to be exactly the same sort of thing as The Vampire Armand or Blood and Gold, etc. That being a detailed look at the background and history of the vampire Pandora, and again, this book is of similar quality to those two.Pandora is an interesting character, and it is certainly a change to have a female as the focal point rather than yet another pretty boy."
3,very good...,"i thought that this book was very well written. it gave us a chance to see a new kind of vampire. pandora is somewhat naive at times, but when she needs to be, she is a very strong character. i liked this book so much because anne rice set pandora apart from all of the other characters. she is one of the unique ones. i gave it 3 stars because the story seemed to drag from time to time, however, it picked up the pace. i recommend this to anyone who is familiar with the writing style of anne rice."
2,Disappointing....,"Because I enjoyed most of the other vampire books so much, I was really looking forward to reading this one. It doesn't go anywhere new. It was a rehash of the other stories. I finished it; but found it rather dull."
4,IT was great,I thought that the book was great with the exception of it not being long enough. I cannot weight till the next vampire chronical comes out.
2,A disappointment to Vampire fans,"I was really looking forward to this, the new book in my favorite fiction series of all time and I am very disappointed to say the book just falls flat. What happened? Like other reviewers, I just got bored with it and set it down; I havent been able to finish it. :( I just couldnt get into it at all, there is nothing new at all in the writing style- and the story is very dull. Pandora writes exactly the way Lestat does in his books sans the flash and interest... Anne, what happened?"
4,Rice has done it again!!,"I enjoyed this book as much as the rest of the series. I wished for so long that Anne Rice would continue her Vampire Series. If you enjoyed reading into the lives of the other vampires in the other books, then you won't be disappointed by this book. Pandora is an interesting character who takes you back to ancient Rome. I bought this book to read over the summer and I finished it in less than two weeks. I would recommend it to anyone who truly loves Anne Rice's Vampires."
4,The spell was too short.,"I was still hungry after I read the book. Anne Rice seems to have served the meal, but forgot the dessert. It was satisying, but not enough. And what of Marius? I love Armand, but Marius should be the next story. Perhaps, she is saving the best for last...Annyway, Mrs. Rice, your creativity continues to be inspiring...may it be as immortal as your vampires!"
4,Slow beginning - excellent after first 10-15 pages!,"As usual, Anne Rice is spell binding with her sense of place and time in history. After a slow beginning, this novel proves to be a delicious beginning to a new Vampire saga!"
4,Sink Your Teeth Into One of the Other Vampire Chronicles,"This novel pales in comparison to the other Vampire Chronicles. With many references to her other works, I get the impression that Anne Rice is tempting the reader to go pick up her other novels as well...and I must admit that it worked- I did go buy ""Memnoch the Devil"" after reading this novel, and found that I got more for my money (but that's another review!)I found the Roman setting very intriguing, but the story seemed to lack the usual atmoshere that the other vampire chronicles exuded. Also, the characters did not seem as well-developed. This felt more like a short story in comparison to her other works.The book was enjoyable, but my suggestion is to wait for it to come in paperback...I know that I wish I had."
5,WOW,"Anne Rice has outdone herself this time. As a huge fan I must say that this is one of the most thrilling, exciting and compelling novels to date. Pandora is excellent. I admire this character in ways that could never apply to Lestat. Pandora comands the audience, her power is felt and it outshines Lestat. He has been upstaged. This story is one of love, strength and courage of no other magnitude found in the previous books of the vampire chronicles. I discover once again why I so love Anne Rice's work. I say, Let Lestat pass now from fiction into legend and let the others bask in their new found glory. This is a must read for any Rice fan."
3,It was interesting,"Pandora was very slow moving, it took me a while to finish it. I'd say when i reached page 135,it started getting very interesting. After that page, I couldn't put the book down, within a few hours I was done with ""Pandora"". I give it 3 stars. Now im on to ""Armand"" Though i'd love to see more of Lestat. Ya gotta love him. Keep up the good work Anne. Can't wait to read ""Vittorio"""
5,great book,"I really thought this book was one of the best books I have ever read. Ms. Rice did such a great job describing the historical events. I do wish that the book was a little longer. The reason why I enjoyed this book so such is because in the other books Ms. Rice never really wrote too such about Pandora and there was no mention of her history at all. I always though she was quite and liked keeping to her self. But when I read the book I realized that she was not quite at all, but instead she is lonely, and still is not recovered from the things that happened to over the years. This book is filled with romance, history, adventure, love and lose. I recommend it to anyone."
3,so-so.,"one of the first reviews here says that marius made pandora and then later made lestat. duh! magnus made lestat and then leapt into the fire. oh, anyway, the book was alright but only to hear more about the vampires, not because her writing is that great. it wasn't nearly as awful as violin, though."
2,A lesson in Roman History?,"Although Mrs. Rice's return to the vampire series is refreshing, after her last few attempts to keep a reader excited about her ""latest book"" (Violin depressed me and I left it unfinished as with Menmoch the Devil), I will be hard-pressed to buy any new releases. Pandora felt like a roman history lesson - boring (I skipped over pages), and I felt she should have focused more on Pandora's life as a vampire and her feelings for Marius. I detect somewhat an ""I am woman hear me roar"" type of personality in Pandora. Give me more LeStat and his army or even better - Ramses! Maybe Anne needs a ""sabbatical"" to freshen up her tales from the darkside."
2,Not up to snuff!,"Quite disappointing - quite unlike her previous gorgeous evocations of New Orleans and vampiric personae. I have always found Rice's writing to be lush and lyrical albeit somewhat uneven, but this book felt somewhat paltry in flavor and texture. Much more time should have been spent on the vampiric existence of Pandora. Am I imagining this, or did she crank this out in record time? Hope she is a little more generous with Armand..."
3,"Good, but not necessary","With ""Interview with the Vampire"", Anne Rice showed us that vampires are not only evil killing creatures, they also have feelings. With ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned"", we learned the origin of the vampires. In ""Memnoch the Devil"", we learned about the creation of the world. ""The Tale of the Body Thief"" and ""Pandora"", sadly, do no add any new piece to the puzzle. They're only stories (a not very good one in the case of TBT), period. Of course, I've enjoyed to learn about how Pandora became a vampire, but I think we could expect a little more from a great author such as Anne Rice."
2,barely kept my interest,"as a lover of lestat and the lurid tales of ALL vampyres, I was sourly disapointed. this book that some call fabulous has next to nothing of the lore and passion that the others had. it barely kept my interest and i wasn't sad when i was finished. maybe rice should give it a rest, her audiance is slippng."
3,Historically more interesting than the main character,"I believe this to be one of Rice's best, though Pandora as a vampire character is not as interesting as Lestat was. This novel is more interesting in a historical way... It is quick moving and does answer some questions from past novels. Worth the quick read."
3,No real characters,"I felt as if this was just a wives' tale. Ann Rice needs more details and settings in her stories. I didn't connect with the characters. In short, I hated this elementary school story."
3,Where is the Anne Rice I knew???,"In the past I have been absolutely enthralled by the works of Anne Rice. I've read all of the previous installments of the Vampire Chronicles with intense anticipation of the next chapter and a desire for the story to never end. Pandora was far from what I expected. If it were my first experience with Anne Rice's works, I frankly wouldn't spend my money on another. Her previous vampire novels all had such passion and excitement and I found this one boring. The story can be summed up in several sentences. Again I ask, where is the Anne Rice I knew????"
3,"It started good, but the end.....","when I saw the movie ""Interview with the vampire"" I forgot Stephen King a little and decided to read Anne Rice. My first book of course was the interview, after that I read ""vampire Lestat"" and now I finished ""Pandora"". Although the history of her life during the greco-roman history is fascinating and catches your attencion, the book lacks some points that keeps it from being good. As you are reading you can feel that the history is growing, but from the middle to the end it loses the grip and the book ends ""cold"". I'm coming back to Stephen King's books !"
4,An excellent book!,"This was the first Rice book that I read and I loved it. I could barely put it down. Some parts were a little confusing, but in general the book is well written and full of great details! I now plan to read her other books!"
4,WONDERFUL ! ! ! I LOVED IT ! ! !,It had been awhile since I had read Memnoch and I became totally immersed in the characters in Pandora. It was like visiting old friends. The historical aspect was amazing. This was classic Anne Rice. Can't wait for the next one. Flavius perhaps?
4,Almost as well thought out as Queen of the Damned,"The story of this book was short, Pandora states her thoughts until you are halfway through the book. And then she summarizes her life with Marius stating that they quarrled for hundereds of years. Anne Rice is a brillent writer, but she needs more plot to her books, many people enjoy knowing the thoughts of the characters, but Pandora just went on and on...I wish Rice would use some of the characters that we know little about such as Jessie, Marharet, Eric, just to name a few...there are more immortals out there than Lestat."
1,"oh, no, not again","lots of talking, not much action, not much added to the body of vampiric lore. moderately slim book in an even more slimming format, makes you think she is either running out of materiel (a bit late for that realization) or that forthcoming is a bunch of similarly sized books designed to lovingly suck money out of your credit card. slowly. agonizingly. but you'll love it. and come back for more. but you yourself will not turn into a writer with similar abilities to separate people like yourselves from their money."
2,Anne Rice can write so much better than this,"I found some pleasure reading this book only because I am such a fan of her vampire (and witches) series and it provided a little more background on one of the major characters of the books, Marius. For someone unfamiliar with the series it would be boring and confusing. It seems to have been written in haste without the characteristic sensuality, magic and depth to which I have become accustomed in her books. I continue to be a great fan of her work, but I found Pandora to be less than satifying."
1,Pandora,"If you really wanted to read a good novel about vampires, this isn't it. I didn't like that Pandora didn't become a vampire until practically the end of the book. It wasn't even that interesting. Nothing exciting or gory happened that you would hope to find in a book dealing with vampires, or at least mysterious. It was just boring."
1,As bad as it gets.,"Oh Dear, Oh Dear, what has happened to Anne Rice. This one was so bad, (I had it on audio) that I took it out of the player and ran over it with my car and tried to forget that I had ever heard it. Please come back Anne."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading all the hype about Anne Rice returning to the style of writing seen in The Vampire L'Estat novels, I must admit I was expecting more than what I got from this novel. Parts of Pandora's history (from childhood to adult) were interesting but after awhile I was ready to move on--unfortunately, Ms. Rice was not. Around the time Pandora was made into a Vampire, the story picked up a little but not much. The characters didn't have the depth I expected, nor was the story as compelling as I would have liked. The story did have its good points, but I must admit, I finished it only because I was listening to it on audiotape (unabridged version) and at times, even that was a struggle."
2,Demoted to paper back,"I was an avid reader of Anne Rice and have most of her books in Hardback. For me all her books were page turners I couldn't put them down. Like Servant of the Bones, which I never finished I'm having trouble just trying to finish the next chapter of Pandora. It doesn't seem to grab me and hold me like her other vampire series. I'm not sure what it is, but there's no excitement in reading Pandora. I'm going to try and finish it. But Anne Rice has been regulated to paperback for me."
2,not so good as the Vampire Chronicles,Pandora is much better reading then Violin or Memnoch but still not so exciting as Lestat or the Queen of the damned... The novel is too short and it does not go deep enough into the character's soul . I am half way through the novel and I do not know what will happen to Flavius yet...I hope we will read about him again..
2,Big disappointment from Rice.,From one huge Anne Rice fan to another: this book was a real disappointment. Unquestionably lacks both the depth and characterization of previous vampire and Mayfair witches tales. A real bummer. This book should have been about 3 times as long with 3 times the story before ever being published.
3,"They're Back! But not as good as ""...Body Thief""!","I was so glad that Ms. Rice has decided to continue to write about the vampires. I really missed them. The book was a great beginning to a new series however, it lacked the excitement of ""Tales of a Body Thief"" or ""Interview"" for that matter. Nonetheless , I love Anne and I will continue to read the new chronicles. If this series is anything like the last, they will only get better for sure!"
3,Not bad.,"This is really only my second taste of Anne Rice. I tried reading Interview at a younger age and found Rice's interior philisophical debates boring (I wanted blood-sucking action!). So when I needed a book for a long plane trip, I was very reluctant in picking up PANDORA. I was surprised although not blown away by any means. Rice is still given in to writitng away long philisophical debates, most of which have nothing to do with the characters. The book is too short and the last chapter was uneccessary! Over all it was an enjoyable read even though it's not really about vampires. I'd still suggest it to anyone."
3,Too Much and Not Enough,"Anne Rice spends too much time developing the background characters and not enough time with Marius and Pandora. It is very interesting to read for the historical references, but for someone like me who just wanted to read a good Anne Rice vampire book it is disappointing. Too much time was spent talking about her life before she became a vampire. But it was still worth reading."
2,"Wake me when it's over, please.","Pandora was a snooze. I dozed off to my history professor as a kid, and here I am dozing off on the train to Anne Rice. This might be a fabulous book for insomniacs, however. The writing was strained, and we didn't really get into any *meaty* action. It was a tad tense as to how she would dispatch Lucius and the zealous vampires that showed up at her home, but the rest of it seemed to be plodding along Roman history. In fact - it moved about as fast as Flavius and his ivory leg. And why does everything she writes along the vampire line have to do with someone writing something down? Interview was a telling of Louis's story, and this is Pandora relating her life to David. Let's live life in the present, Anne, and just flashback occasionally to the past. More writing like the Mayfair witch trilogy might restore my faith."
4,An excellent return to the writing that made us love her.,"PANDORA is the best book Anne Rice has written in years. The story of a strong-willed woman in Ancient Rome is as intriquing as anything Anne has ever written, and she has finally returned more to the style of her older works. The book would have been better if Anne had touched a little on what Pandora had been doing in the last fifteen or so hundred years, but at least the part she gave us is definitely worth reading. This book has restored my faith in Anne's ability. Pandora is an excellent character -- the kind of woman that any one of us knows today, creating a great parallel from the ancient Roman civilation and our own. The introduction of Flavius was wonderful, especially now that we can look forward to someday hearing his ""vampire tales."" Only Anne Rice can write like this. Thank goodness she is doing it again!"
3,Where's the thrill??,"After finishing ALL her books couldnt wait for this series. So disappointed, Who is David? DidI miss something. Not too thrilled with Marius either.Couldn't get the point of the King & Queen, what's turns them on? Too many years in her life are missing to keep context flowing. I miss New Orleans scene"
5,Her best vampire,"I love the fact that at least one female figure in this vampire world is given the chance to talk! It is impossible not to fall in love with her. She is strong, intelligent and the descriptions about old Rome are amazing. There isn't a single unnecessary word in this book. Once you start reading it, you fall into Pandora's world and never want to leave her side. Her story with Marius is also heartbreaking. I love them both. I wish there was a book about Marius also, to tell about all those years Pandora did not see him."
3,A Great documentary on Roman history!,"I believe I found this book in the wrong section, it was in Fiction. This is only the second Anne Rice book I've read, first being Vittorio. Of these two books, I believe they both focus on the incorrect elements of the story. I wanted to read a Vampire story, however what I read was a dissertation on Upper-Class Roman lifestyle and Religous History. I was dissapointed that the books were not about the story of a Vampire's life as a Vampire, but rather as the events living up to the point they become a Vampire...do you agree? I am starting on the Interview series next, maybe Lestat, since I already saw the movie, and Im hoping this book is much different. Good Points; well...It is available in the supercool format of BIG PRINT !"
4,Beautifully written but too much Roman history,"I enjoy Anne Rice's books for their great detail, and the ease with which you can picture the events as they happen. However, this one was too full of history, and lacking in actually story. If I had torn the middle of the book out, and made it a short story, it would have been great. I wanted more about Padora's 2000 years! More About Marius, and less Roman history. I envy her skills, but I wish she would use those skills to fill out the story better. While enthralled, I was left hungry at the end!"
5,A non stop reader,"Pandora was quite a interesting book, I couldnt stop reading it, It was "" cool "" because, it was truly a life story of a vampire God ! Hopefully anne Rice will come out with another bok with Pandora in it ! after reading this book It made me think that not all vampire's are bad."
2,I can't give her just one star because I love her so much,"I love Anne Rice, I mean LOVE her stories! However, this one was well....bad. Actually, it put me to sleep (and I am an insomniac). I couldn't find any story in it. It was pretty words but no depth. It was telling us something we already know. The worst part was being too long winded. I know, she is long winded anyway, but it usually pays off. This one didn't. I read Memnoch and was disappointed there too (though not as bad as Pandora) and Violin was awful. Please please please, Ms. Rice....write like you used to! Your books (the old ones) are what made me want to be a writer! Please!"
3,Another Fine Read,Loved It. Ann Rice Fan. Have not been let down yet. Eager to read the entire Chronicle. Try the sample and decide right away.
4,A good addition to the previous vampire tales,"This is a good addition to the previous vampire tales. However, I thought that the descriptions of Pandora's mortal life took up too much of the book. I was hoping for more of her vampiric life. The descriptions either way are very vivid. You feel like you are there. I can hardly wait until The Vampire Armand comes out. I hope it will deal with the ""juicy"" parts like his relationship with Daniel. By the way, when will we ever hear more about Daniel and Jesse? They haven't been seen in any novels since Queen of the Damned."
4,A interesting look at LOVE and how it is taken for granted,Anne Rice uses Vampires (hyper-sensitive creatures) to heighten our own senses to human feelings that are normally taken for granted. If you read between the lines of this story you will see that Pandora is an anti-heroic symbol of hope for the human race. And that hope emerges from the fact that human beings are beautiful people. The things we do are beautiful. The things we create are motivated by our need for beauty. And all of this springs from the love of the human heart. And Pandora FEEDS upon this!
3,it's not her best nor her worst effort....,"I am surprised that she came out with a book about Pandora. Although she proves an interesting character, the book often stalls in places. Her devotion to detail actually becomes tiresome in this work...I was surprised. It continues, if ever so incrementally, the tales of the chronicles, but I too await a return to the Rice of earlier times....but is that possible given the pressure she's probably under to continue to publish?"
4,I loved it!!,"I have had ""Pandora"" sitting on my shelf for more than 6 months and I just picked it up to read the other day. I wish I had done it sooner. It was great to read about a new character that wasn't so tied into The Vampire Chronicles. I love the history in the book and once again I felt like I was right there watching everything happen. I can't quite put my finger on it but for me this book was the quickest read of any of her other books I've read. Some people were disapointed... I thought the change of pace was refreshing."
3,"Oh well, it's Rice, but...","I wasn't that happy to know that she made a whole book about Pandora, who I though to be a very boring person, but I had to admit, that she always changes my mind. It is not as good as the other books, because it really does have too much history in it. I like reading historic novels sometimes, but much is too much. I liked the book, but I'm still wating for the book that takes my breath away, like B.T"
2,Pandora,"I would probably be a bit more forgiving if anyone besides Anne Rice had written this book. As it is, I feel that Anne could have done better. Hasn't she proved to us before what a wonderful writer she is with such books as The Vampire Lestat, Interview With the Vampire, Cry to Heaven, and Feast of all Saints? The writing style of Pandora was simple to the point of being childesh. The plot itself was dull, as were also the characters. Compared with the fiasco that is The Vampire Armand it is relatively harmless. At least she didn't ruin any of her characters in this one."
4,"Good book, especially if you like Anne Rice","The story is intriguing and compelling; very much in the spirit of the Lestat books. The details of the Roman history of both world events of the time and small details such as what they ate for dinner, combine with the beautiful and suspensful writing of Anne Rice in this, one of my favourite of Ms.Rice's books. The plot reminds me of that of her second book,""The Vampire Lestat"", and the fact that Rice is writing from the perspective of a female is a spescial treat (In all of the Vampire chronicles Rice uses a man, mainly Lestat, as the narrator.) This is a wonderful book and great to read in one sitting (I believe it is the shortest of the Vampire chronicles). It also shows a hint of the same concepts as ""Servant of the Bones"" another one of Rice's entertaining books. One of the lightest and most enjoyable of the recent Rice books,""Pandora"" is on my top 10 list."
2,Indulgent,I was disappointed by this one- it's pure self indulgence for the author and lacks the interest of the Lestat books- a comment I see echoed by some other reviewers. It jumps great tracts of history that would have made great backdrops to the story. On the positive side it has more pace than Memnoch.
1,Extremely disappointing,"I have really enjoyed other books by this author. However, Pandora seemed to be one of her worst researched, full of 'filler' and missing the attention to detail seen so often evident in books such as 'Cry to Heaven' and other period pieces. This books seems rushed to market."
4,Feminism in the Roman Empire?,"I love learning something new, with Anne it never fails. Her books are always a fascinating look at the human condition- the drama, the ecstasy and the pain of what it would be like to live through everything. The loss of fragility, the loss of risk, these themes are reoccuring in Anne's many books but I think that Pandora is book where a woman's pain, and a woman's place is the perspective. As far a character is concerned, Pandora is a little more sallow than Lestat, but then again who isn't. Pandora is a great book by all standards, it's funny and perverse and there is so much beautiful discription, not to mention a history lesson or three."
4,wonderfully entertaining,I thought this book was exellent. Anne Rice is a great author and this book is just another one of her triumphs. I thought the backround of the ancient romans was the highlight of the book. However I would have love to have seen Rice take her character further through history in more depth. That would be AMAZING.
4,"Magnificent work, although not as in depth","I love Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and very much enjoyed this chapter. However, I did find it lacking in detail and depth, contrary to her previous novels. It failed to answer a number of questions brought up previously, particularly in The Vampire Lestat. Still, a wonderful book."
2,Not Rices best work,Anne RIces original vampire chronicles far surpass this book. If you have read the original vampire chronicles don't spoil the beauty and reality of the myth that Anne Rice weaves in the first three books by reading this book. Also steer clear of Memnoch the devil. If you are new to Anne Rice do yourself a favour and read Interview with the Vampire instead.
1,I'm disappointed.,Pandora is extremely introspective past the point of interest. I used to love the plots and action scenes in all of her other novels except Violin but in Pandora all the action is mental and tends to get boring. The dream sequences repeat over and over and seem like fill. The effect is like reading tapes of visits to a shrink. I guess that I think the plot is rated much lower than introspection. I did not enjoy this book.
2,Whatever happened?,"Anne Rice swept me away with her first two novels in the Vampire Chronicle series, but with the introduction of Queen of the Damned and Tale of the Body Theif, I knew something was beginning to slip. Memnoch the Devil was a complete falling away from what the Chronicles once was, but I had hope with the release of Pandora. Disappointingly, this book's primary focus was Pandora's mortal life and not her trials as a vampire. Although the history of her life as well as the greco-roman imagery and history is stunning and fascinating, this is not a vampiric book."
3,"A good character study, but short on plot.","This is a predicatable follow-up to the long-winded yet interesting philosophy of Memnoch. Again, Rice gives us a rich and beautiful character study, this time with an embedded history lesson. It's shorter than it looks- the book's smaller physical size, larger type, and fewer pages are hidden by a gorgeous binding, in the old style, and an attractive dust jacket.But bear in mind, it's a character study; the plot is secondary (if not tertiary). If you enjoy strong imagery and lush description, and don't mind a so-so plot, you'll enjoy _Pandora_."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Call it a guilty pleasure--but I loved this book. Okay, to be fair, I loved the audiobook. It's read by a woman whose British accent, although perhaps incongruous with the action, made the book a pleasure to listen to! And the story was wonderfully meaty and riveting. Although written in Ricean prose (overwrought and flowery) Read's British narration as Pandora helped balance this out, and make it an incredibly fun listen."
4,Good story with an anticlimactic ending,"I truly enjoyed reading the body of the story and discovering how Pandora was made into a vampire. I was very disappointed after Pandora became a vampire. There didn't seem to be much story left but the majority of the book is concerned with ancient history. Was Pandora's life really that boring once she became a vampire. If so,why write an entire book about her? If you like ancient Roman history than this is an interesting novel. It is not a classic Anne Rice novel, however."
3,"Pandora, the irreal woman.","I liked the book for it's descriptions of ancient Rome and Antioch but I cannot say that I liked the caracter who is everything but Rice's. Pandora has a very special way to live. She is quite alien to her environment and although she pretends the contrary she is loveless to everything not even to Marius.I find in her caracter something far more repulsive: Pandora reflects the very northwestern philosophy of the 21 century although she is supposed to be a chaotic,passionate Roman figure. In other words this woman has no life, no light and thus no relevance, no reality. It is not surprising that she likes her loneliness.I like her alone too."
1,Unbelievably boring ... don't waste your time,"Ms. Rice creates such a beautiful story of Marius in ""Lestat, the Vampire"".To pair him with the one dimensional character of Pandora is a insult.This book starts out well and then dumps into the stupid."
2,very slow compared to her other Vampire Sagas,I was really disapointed! Too much about Roman History and not enough about the charachters. I didn't buy this book to get a history lesson.
2,boring,"I used up about two months to finish this book. The longest period ever. The story mainly concentrate on the two characters Pandora and Marius, focus on their argument, their disagreement, this is boring, I fell asleep many times and have no incentives to catch up the story. The gory scene is not enough, it seems like a love story more than a vampire story. One thing that I appreciate most is the discription of the art of Rome."
4,Good Read for a First Timer!,This is the first Ann Rice book I have read and I was captivated. Pandora just sucked me in and I could not put it down. I found it to be a fast read. I can not wait to read another one of her books...
3,Standard Rice,"I've read all of Rices Vampire-books, and this is hardly one of the best. It's not bad, but not too special either. What I like the most is that a big part of the book's events take place in ancient Rome, a time and place which I find very interesting. Also the thing that the main character is female is different in a positive way. The most important part of the story is the relationship of Marius and Pandora, which Rice describes well. I think it's a bit boring that Pandora ends her story quite early, and then the text returns to modern age. I would have liked to hear more about her, like where was she and what did she do before the ""Queen of the Damned"". The book is quite short compared to the ones before it. It's quite standard Rice, really. So, if you are a fan, you won't be very disappointed, or may even like the book a lot. But if you're looking for a really good horror/fantasy-book, I don't think Pandora is the best choice."
5,Where do you go wrong with Anne Rice? You don't!,"Anne Rice returns with yet another outstanding novel full of the enthralling imagery and beautiful, lush style that has characterized her work for as long as she has been writing. Pandora is such a divine character and her insights into her world, both past and present, are haunting and disturbingly acute. You just don't wrong with Anne Rice, or Pandora!"
2,It wasn't one of her best efforts.,"I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I found her last few books weren't that great, I am so disappointed. I love Anne Rice really! Her earlier works left you dying for more. The 1st three books in The Vampire Chronicles were excellent. They were filled with lively loveable characters. Characters that seemed so lifelike, you could believe that they could exist. I miss the old characters. Wake up Lestat! We miss you!"
2,Just enough to make me truly miss a beloved mentor!,"Anne's last four novels have made me feel as if she has forsaken her fans for the almighty dollar. Pandora, one of the characters that has long intriqued me, has left me $20.00 short. I have been in love with Louis, Lestat, David, Rowan, Mona, Lasher, and Rameses. I miss the luster and the passion that Anne wrote. I miss the way she would weave a story around me, and the frenzy I would reach at the mention of her name. Now I long for my money back, and when my family, never understanding the passion I had for her literature, now asks me about her latest. I cringe. I am embaressed. Anne, where did you go? Will you come back?"
2,"Too much rambling, again. Very slow paced.","This book is mostly about ancient Rome. This book can be summarized in a couple of sentences, the rest is Rome, philoshophy, adjectives, blah, blah, blah. Very, VERY slow paced."
3,It Was Okay,"I wouldn't give Pandora a 5. It was definitely not the best of the Vampire Chronicles, but likeable none the less. I mostly enjoyed the book because it revealed more about Pandora and Marius (who is one of my fave vamps). Pandora's past was not all that interesting... the book had rather a calmness to it. It was not a rollercoaster, but more like a cruise. Read to catch up on history of the vamps Pandora and a bit on Marius, other wise, if you're not interested, get a guidebook and skip it."
1,total disappointment,"Pandora lacks the zeal which is usually found in the other Vampire Chronical novels. The excitement level in this book is extremely low and the plot goes absolutely nowhere. All I got from this book was a damned history lesson. What would have improved the book would be to include her relationship to the vampires Azim and Santigo. The was an extreamly dissapointing novel when it had so much potential. All we read about is Marius,Marius, Marius! So what. Bring back Lestat...please!"
3,More vampire less talk!,"Please Anne. We love vampires! We see enough people, we dont need stories about people.I am hurt. I bought this book hoping that Anne was branching out (she is) with the masterly written (writing is still great) vampire stories. The problem was that Pandora is a vampire for about 20 pages. Its not until the VERY end that this all happens. Yes I understand dramatic climax... I have read plenty about people. Its the vampires that I thirst for, please Anne, more vampires less people. Please."
2,"Overwritten, overwrought",Obviously Anne Rice's publishers would publish her weekly grocery lists if she submitted them in book form. Her early vampire and Mayfair novels were SO good - I can't imagine this drivel comes from the same author.
2,weak and watered down,"I love Ms. Rice's work, but Pandora, what happened Ms.Rice, had to make a deadline....way too much ""filler"". Book should have been titled Roman history. Ms.Rice could have done so much more with this book. Skipped around and over alot of the heart of the story. I hope this is not what the future hold for you and the next of your novels."
4,A look back,"Pandora is in all aspects a look back. I enjoyed Pandora a lot. Though it sometimes would settle on the less important, Pandora is very good."
4,Excellent!,Her detail shocked me with the power of her diction was awesome! I really enjoyed it and recommend it to all the Rice fans out there!
2,Why is this woman still writing?,"Another clumsy attempt at a novel by a gifted but immensely lazy writer. Of course there are beautifully worded passages, and wonderful details about ancient Rome - but a story - what story? There is nothing new here. We have read this story, much better told in her earlier works. Everything is off, the pacing, what she details and what she skips, all carelessly thrown on the page. There is nothing more she has to say about her vampires and she should just have done with it already."
4,A little problem but very responsive,Book arrived in protective wrapping (unlike most vendors-put it in a container and mail) but it had a sizable tear btwn the spine and pages--only detected by flipping thru the pages. Contacted the vendor and vendor was very apologetically for missing the book damage and immdly offered full return. Instead I consulted with a local librarian who recommended a shot of Elmer's glue and overnight pressing of the book. All was well. Keeping the book and thank the vendor for the return offer and promptly communications.
4,"A fun, smashing aerial adventure tale","For those interested in history, the Stories from the Golden Age pulp reprints fill in some very large gaps and many times the history less you get is just as enjoyable as the story. The Sky-Crasher is no exception. I didn't actually realize how much the post office had to do with aviation. In fact, it was the post office that got commercial flight off the ground--who knew? Anyway, The Sky-Crasher follows the exploits of Caution Jones. Despite his well-earned nickname, he finally breaks down and risks the hazards of a around-the-world flight so his airline can secure international airmail contracts. Of course his pretty co-pilot is pretty feisty, and a rival airline is willing to see him dead to win the race, but that just adds to fun."
4,lean and elegant,"This wildly eclectic anthology of well-known pieces, performed by an accomplished musical company to modest instrumental accompaniment, is a sampler of what grouped voices can accomplish under masterful directorship in the sparest of styles.This album introduces what the Singers can do. It is held together not by genre or composer but simply by the fact that varying traditions are performed here by the group, thus the word 'Collection' in the title.If you like what the Cambridge singers do here, you'll likely want to purchase one of their more thematically consistent albums, perhaps beginning with their Christmas album.Choral music maintains its lively presence at Cambridge in spite of a million competing, and sometimes distracting, pressures. Perhaps it's something in the air or water of the ancient university town. Clare College, Cambridge, is the anchor of the Singers, and to be thanked for performing that role."
3,It's OK,"This ring needs to be a little thicker, to keep the food from spilling out when the always hungry fish attack it. I still have to turn off the filter pump while the fish finish their meal, since the they force much of the food out of the ring and it gets sucked into the skimmer."
3,Not too bad!,"A lot of the videos were ones that I wasn't too crazy for back in the 80s. Other than that, I like seeing and bringing back the memories!"
1,Never received this book,Never received this book. Don't remember who the seller was but it never showed up at either my current address or the address that I used to receive mail at. A great disappointment and I hope I get my money back or that they send the book out. It's probably lounging behind a desk or something.
3,Good research but not too engaging,"I give the book high marks for the research that apparently went into the book. There were a number of references cited in the book that were new to me. Maybe that was enough to earn it 4 stars, but like another reviewer I found the presentation to be a bit disjointed and uneven.Mr. Honan previously wrote a biography on Shakespeare, so it appears he was careful to avoid discrediting Stratfordian doctrine, or contradicitng what was prevously written, which may account for some of the inconsistency. I feel the book would have been much more effective if the focus remained on Marlowe, and had not attempted to explore a possible relationship between the two men."
4,In-depth interview for Ryder / Jolie fans,For every fan of Winona Ryder and/or Angelina Jolie this DVD is a must have. Real conversations and not those merry-go-lucky one or two sentecnes from Leno and Co.I - as a big Winona Ryder fan - hope that her 1997 appearance at Charlie Rose will be released on DVD someday...
3,Horizons,"This is a ""modern day"" romance which is different for Catherine Hart. It was ok, but I am more of a 19th century romance kind of reader. I enjoyed the suspense. There is a plane crash on a desert island, and initially the story seemed to really resemble the tv show ""Lost"" with similar characters and everything, but again, that changed as the story progressed. It was ok, but I'll stick to her other books based in the 1800's."
4,It was a really great feel good book,"After the plane crashes, who will survive and how? That was an interesting plot line. I only wish it was more explicit when they are rescued. Other than that it was a really great read!"
5,Nice Guys,StruckDown did a great job on this cd its really good its put togeather very well and its something to rock too i like it
4,ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW,"The Renaissance Soul: Life Design for People with Too Many Passions to Pick Just OneJust the title of this book excited me because, on the one hand, it assures me that I will never run out of travel ideas while on the other hand, helping me not to waste the precious time I have left seeing ""mistakes."" Not that I, or probably anyone, will agree with all thousand choices, but having the info all in one place should make it easy to satisfy an endless thirst for something new."
2,Nothing special,Not sure what I was expecting but I think you can get the same thing from a cheap journal without the fancy name
1,Disappointed,"I thought I was buying the book that outlined the 1,000 places to see before dying and what I got was a blank paged book with the 1,000 places to visit before you die cover on it."
2,Counting down...,"This author's previous book, after which this one is titled, informed us how we should pass our time before we die, as well as outlining the considerable lengths to which we must go before we CAN die. This book provides a practical interface to the original; a blank-paged ""tick-off"" format with which we can chart our Dante-esque journey. This ""travellers' book of the dead"" is increasingly to be seen all around the world, clutched by grim processions of the travelling undead, who trudge miserably from place to place like legions of the damned, anxious to tick the next location off the list. Upon completion, this journal is presented as evidence to an impatient grim reaper, who then mercifully dispatches the traveller to their ultimate reward. The fact that this book helps with some ""nuts-and-bolts"" travel practicalities is all very well, but this does little to alleviate the grim finality of its ultimate destination."
4,Good Addition,"This book is high quality and a good addition to ""1000 Places To See Before You Die,"" but not really necessary. Has good trivia interspersed throughout it and between whatever you write in it during your travels."
4,A Good Motivator,"In the past I have often taken a spiral notebook on trips with the intention of keeping a daily journal, but intentions don't always translate into reality. This sturdy, easy-to-carry journal contains plenty of space for writing, but, more importantly, is a great motivator for actually keeping that journal. After all, I paid for this fancy book and should certainly fill it with insightful observations and experiences! The basic information it provides (conversions, useful phrases, etc.) also encourage keeping it handy. The daily travel quotes and the occasional lists scattered throughout are enjoyable to note.-Lynn Michelsohn, author of Roswell, Your Travel Guide to the UFO Capital of the World!"
4,Nice think...,That's nice idea for all travellers... This could be your amazing travel diary... And price is 3 times lower than in european bookshops!
3,Lack of information,I would think if you were going to provide a book and list the pool companies you would also list the material contractors and possibly the artisans.I installed the materials on one of the North Carolina pools. The pool contractor likely had no idea where the materials came from and initially provided substandard labor. Hardly qualifying for a master pool rating.The materials used were economical and high quality -the impression is that these are out of common reach installations. Hardly the case. Excellent pictoral representation of the projects however.
1,Master Built Pools and Patios,"If I could have viewed some pages of this book it may have inspired me to purchase it. It is quite an expensive book foo the topic and without a chance to look first, I think you may lose some buyers."
3,Good double feature DVD,Hugh OBrian does a decent acting job in this fim. Endings are predictable. These vintage double feature fims are worth watching . Thanks.
2,Course book that is required,"This book is written by the Department chair at the University of Houston-Victoria who does know his material. The major issue with the book is the dated nature of its material as most of what gets covered is from SQL 2000. It is in dire need of updating to reflect how SQL Server is managed today, instead of how it was done from 1999 to before the release of SQL 2005 in November 2005."
5,A Mormon Scholar reports,"I hold a master's degree in history and am particularly interested in Mormon and Western history. This is perhaps one of the best books I have ever read. This has been a research topic for the author for nearly twenty years, beginning as her doctoral dissertation entitled ""Insanity and the Sweet Singer."" Avery took great pains in researching this book, and delayed its publication until full disclosure of all works became available upon the death of David's final grandson. David was like a young prince, forced to live in the shadow of a famous father and older brother, both leaders of respective churches. Avery shows the slow descent into madness experienced by David Hyrum Smith as he tries to find his place. A disasterous mission to Salt Lake City to convert Mormons will be of interest to Mormons, Reorganized LDS members and readers in general. The look at the Elgin asylum is an fascinating topic for interested parties as well. You cannot go wrong with this book."
2,Hype not substance,"Other ""hip"" teachers at my school use this, so I bought it. Some of the activities are okay. Some will frustrate you, though, if you really know literary devices well. For example, the activities and examples of allusions aren't wholly accurate. I wish I remembered specifics to share. All and all, I copied a couple of poems from it and that's about it. Waste."
5,Kids really relate to it,"I teach 8th grade English in a predominantly white, suburban town. I used this book to create a whole poetry unit which is based on music. The activities are great for teaching figurative language while comparing old-school poetry with old-school rap! The kids get excited when they know the songs, and I even sing to them. Their final project is a song analysis. It's really enjoyable and it's a great way to introduce a taste of hip-hop culture."
5,Works as expected,"This fit into my sink perfectly, and it works well. I have stuck it in the dishwasher a few times to clean it off, and it held up fine. This is a good way to dry dishes without taking up counter space."
5,Great product!,"Nothing fancy, but this twin drainer fits perfectly in my sink. It holds a fair amount of dishes and is well constructed. Very pleased."
4,Fun Watch! but Battery Replacement?,"Great watch, however - be sure to pace your usage. The instruction manual instructs the user to send the watch to the manufacturer for battery replacement - which for some reason is complicated for this watch.Also, there is no setting to keep the L.E.D. lights on permanently.Fun watch, but definately not as good as I was hoping for."
4,stylish,"I bought this watch a month ago, and I'm really satisfied with it. It's a watch that you can use for occasional wearing, but it's an excellent choice if you want to wear something stylish, or flashy on a party.I love it, and I would probably buy the same one if I had to buy again.The reason it didn't get a five star rate, is that you have to push the top button every single time you want to look at the clock. It is not a good choice for people wo are always running, looking at their watches constantly.I recommend it to anybody who likes different things a little bit, and it makes a perfect gift, too."
1,.....comes around,"Sometimes its easy to slag off somthing, from a distance, or indeed up close, but why does Gary Hall make it this easy ! make no mistake this is not his worst attempt at rock stardom, but it comes close. He really needs to have a rethink, maybe get back to his Lancastrian roots, and the dizzy heights of Blue Seige? marco and mick, the sly and robbie of the musically cultured north west of england. At the moment, gary's only claim to musical fame is his (only) passing resemblance to Slash from guns n roses, though I didnt realise that Slashes surname is Yerwrists.!!!!!"
1,DOESNT FIT E3c,"These don't fit the E3c's!! I like the bass-sound of the foams that came with the E3c's, but they got caked in dirt and don't expand like they used to in my ear canal. I need new ones, but these don't fit. They may work fine for other models, but who knows which ones? I hope they take ""e3c"" out of the description and I'd sure like my money back..."
1,Empty,"The package came, just like you would find in a store, except when i opened the zippered circular wire-wrapper it comes in, nothing was there, it was empty. ended up going down to guitar center to get the bigger pack. was much easier. these are the most comfortable way for me to listen to my awesome shure headphones, as the soft and hard rubber both irritate my ears after two hours of use (aka long airplane/car rides)."
2,not very organized,"besides the content.. just the layout of this book is terriblethere are no colours (only blue, black, white) and the font is so light....the book jumps around a lot and the diagrams are not well drawn..just order it urself and see"
5,works great,"After trying to get one from the local auto parts place,I have decided to check Amazon.It was cheaper than the parts store and free delivery.I installed it on my dad's Avalon and it works great."
2,"Have to seal it quickly or it peels. Still chips, though.","My nails split and peel, so I wanted something to seal them. I tried this product alone and hours later, after a bath, it peeled. Water got under it and it peeled off like stickers. Couldn't return it so, to justify the expense, I now seal it with a top coat before it's completely dry. No more peeling, but it does chip. May try this as a middle layer instead of a base. Will not repurchase."
2,Overpriced,"The single bell you receive is OK quality. There are cheaper bells out there that likely perform just as well, especially when considering the ridiculous shipping charges for a little, light-weight package that was shipped snail-mail via USPS and took a long time to arrive."
5,Great way to keep you thinking,I enjoy this game. It helps me relax plus keeps me thinking and focused.
3,Game Review,This game would be much more fun if it didn't freeze because there are no more moves. This even happens on level one. I have never been able to get higher than level 7 before it freezes.
3,Japanese Prints,"I don't really know anything about Japanese artwork or famous artists-I bought this book a couple years ago for the pictures of the Samurai. Because of this, all I can really say is that it is a well laid-out and attractive book full of beautiful Japanese art depicting all kinds of scenes and subjects. It makes a great coffee-table book."
3,One-third of a famous performance,"This single CD contains highlights from a prestigious recording of this opera-buffa (recorded in London in 1954, remastered in 1988). Even after almost half a century, it has (in my opinion) not become obsolete. I daresay that I prefer the full edition (by the same artists, on three EMI CD's); but of course, the price is different. Still a great performance of a great musical (18th century style)."
3,A children's storybook version of the film,"This is a children's picture-book version of the film _Laputa: the Castle in the Sky_, with illustrations taken from the film.The illustrations are beautiful (five stars there), but the language is pedestrian (this might be a translation problem) and does not do justice to Miyazaki's script. It's best viewed as a memento of the film (soon to be released by Disney as _Castle in the Sky_), not as a stand-alone work.Children might not mind the simple language, and many will bathe in the pictures as they relive the film in their mind. The film is wonderful, but this book doesn't do it justice."
2,Probably NOT what you think it is...,"If you are expecting a ""How To - "" look elsewhere - this is a statistical production record... How much of what, where was produced.... Does not delve into how they did it."
2,History book..,"This is a history book describing the iron industry in the Forest of Dean (England) from the 1200's to the 1800's. It does not cover mining or smelting methods, and assumes you understand how these things were done. There are references to the court of England documents that may be of interest to the historian, and mine locations that may be of interest to a geologist, but if you are interested in learning about iron production methods, there is very little included. I skimmed the entire book, since my interest was the latter."
4,Come with me Lizzy,The film comes across more as a stage play than a movie. Possibly from the era in which the movie was made. I think it was a stage play made into a movie. The actors all doing a fine job with there various roles. Ms. Hepburn played the aging spinstress and makes the right decision of which suitor to hitch her wagon. Burt Lancaster is in fine form as a scam artist selling dreams. We could all use some of his philosophies in our lives. Each role has a lot of hidden complexitites. Tanya Tuckers song follows the movie theme rather closely.
1,Still Waiting for Burt and Kate to Break into Song,"Reviewer is right, think Harold Hill and Marion the Librarian ! First of all, I love the Music Man, and I love Burt and Kate. But even for the 50s this movie is so lame and plain dumb. I kept waiting for it to get better - certainly Burt and Kate would engage in some verbal dueling to elavate this film to a higher level. Nope, anybody want to buy a copy real cheap ????"
5,Move over Spencer! Hepuburn and Lancaster are HOT!,"I think this is one of the 20 best movies ever made, Its got everything love,hate,jelousey,despair,loss,redemption and the chemistry between Lancaster and Hepuburn could make a stone weep! NO woman could ever feel ""plain"" after watching it!!"
5,A Timeless Classic,"Even among so many fine films made in Hollywood during the '50s, the film still stands out one of the best with a very fine script about family, indivduals and life with humor and emotions. A great ensemble piece headlining by Kate Hepburn and warmly supported by Burt Lancaster, Wendell Correy, Lloyd Bridges, Earl Hollomand the the fine actor who played the father."
5,Classic romantic comedy,"Katherine Hepburn is alternately heartbreaking and hilarious as Lizzie Curry, a woman whose sharp-tongued intelligence conceals a crippling inability to believe in herself as a woman. Burt Lancaster gives one of the best performances of his career as Bill Starbuck, a free-spirited big-dreaming sweet-talking con man who convinces Lizzie she can be as beautiful as she wants. An hilarious supporting cast, and some of the most tender and romantic scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Well worth seeing."
2,weighs down fine hair,"In its attempt to thicken fine hair, this product ends up weighing the hair down with goo. Normally I can get away with washing my hair every other day, but if I put this spray on it, I have to wash it out every day."
5,Good hairspray,I really like this hairspray. It makes my hair stay in really good for a long time. Would reccomend it.
4,Does the job.,"Thin, sparse hair has more body when using Jason's - Love it and highly recommend it to others. Great product."
1,War of the Worlds - an historical retrospective,Disc one is an historical retrospective. It's dull. Nothing in it that we didn't know already. Tape quality is very good. Archival footage they could have used they didn't. Not one science fiction writer interviewed. Clips from the 1938 broadcast wasn't used. Instead the narrator tells you about it. Too general.
1,Bore of the Worlds,"This documentary is a total bore. There are no clips from the movies, no excerpts from the radio program, no interviews with anybody important and the interviews there are go on forever. You won't learn anything you don't already know about H. G. Wells or the ""War of the Worlds"". Very disappointed."
4,Well Done!,"I bought this just after I saw the Spielberg film. I must say that overall I liked the DVD set a lot. While I would have liked to hear more of Orson Welles on the 1938 radio show, there was a lot of interesting stuff in disk 1 about Welles and the later panic broadcasts I had never seen. Overall, very interesting and informative.Disk 2 is a Mars science piece with some amazing animations I have never seen. Overall, I'd have to say that it ranks high when compared to some of the other shows on DVD about Mars. Lots of interesting stuff and be sure to look At the Mars Expedition Rover animation. I don't know who did it, but it rocks.I'd give them a combined 4 of 5. Next time be sure to get the Welles voice!"
3,Essentially for the well-heeled traveller,"I was generally disappointed with this guide. While it contained most of the ""must see"" sights, ""must stay"" hotels and ""must dine"" restaurants, most of the recommendations fell on the high end of the price range. And that's another sore point! A range of actual prices, rather than icons (i.e., $$$$ for expensive) would be much more helpful for planning purposes. Having travelled and lived in Germany I know one can have the experience of a lifetime on considerably less money."
4,"Helpful, but still...","I, much to my disgust, have used more than one or two hint books, and this one was an above average one. It had very detailed walk-through, but it's lacking a certain in-depth analysis into the side quests. It focuses on the linear story of the game instead of the much more challenging and entertaining side quests. It does, however, give a detailed description of artifacts and spells and the like and advice on how to use them. It's definitely helpful, and it will get you through the very linear story in a hurry. However, it does leave the side quests to the reader."
3,"Useful, but the Net has lots of free tips and guides","Although ""Icewind Dale"" comes complete with a 100+ page spiral bound book that explains everything from character stats to combat to spells, there are enough little side quests in the game that most players will need to turn somewhere for hints or help at some point.Strategy guides such as this one fill that role by providing detailed tables on, for example, magic items that you might encounter in the game, monster stats, and ""walkthroughs"" that tell you how to complete a level.Before you decide to buy this book, however, check out the free offerings on the Net. www.bgdungeon.com has an ""Icewind Dale"" section that provides you with lots of goodies, ranging from lists of magic items to walkthroughs to detailed maps of the levels. There are message boards where you can find solutions to particular problems, or get advice on dealing with monsters, or -- as will become necessary due to the numerous bugs in the game -- technical support."
2,not that good,the video does not show tom delogne. way too short. not very entertaining at all!!! some parts are cool. but most them are pretty boring.
3,Nephilim: The First Human Clones,Some very interesting ideas for anyone with an open mind.I welcome such.
3,Science review of cloning concept,"Although I found this book interesting, thought provoking, and an easy read it does contain a serious flaw in its basic concept. The basic concept is cloning occured 5,000 ago in which two species created the Nephilim. From a scientific view cloning is a single species event and in fact a single creature event. As such, cloning is not the explanation of how the Nephilim came into existence as indicated in the book. At best, cross species breeding is the scientific description of what the author proposes occured 5,000 years ago.Robert J. Fitzsimmons, Ph.D.The Technical Basis LLC"
3,Not as I thought,"The alphabets and tag art are not stickers, just images printed on the paper that you have to cut and glue it, and the colors are a little faded. It has a lot of different options like first hair cut and other birth marks, but it would be a lot better if they were stickers."
5,My early twenties revisited,"A big THANK YOU to all involved in releasing the Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show series on DVD. Back in summer of 1974, I was 24. I saw 3 of the 4 summer shows and loved the brothers song, So You Are A Star. This song reminded me of Badfinger, another great early '70's band.I loved the brothers harmony and interaction. Chucky and Alan, Rod Hull and his Emu and the very funny and talented supporting troup made for a 30 minute program that went by all too fast.I've sought episodes of this series for years now I gratefully have the entire series on DVD. I, too, hope their 4 summer series shows will be released on DVD as well as their later series, Bonkers!Thank you again, Hudson Brothers! Viewing your sweet, funny and tuneful shows brought a tear to my eye and a smile to my face as I got to revisit my youth one more time."
5,Classic 1970s Saturday morning fare,"The Hudson Brothers were amongst the greats who dominated Saturday morning TV - for the kiddies - as well as some night-time, prime-time viewing too. This collection is the complete series of the Sat. morning ""Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show."" It sure brings back memories, although... I do not remember it being so ""kiddie"" oriented, as to take breaks to remind kids to cross at cross-walks and obey rules, in between the comedic shenanigans, cartoons, and hard rocking' musical numbers. Overall though, it's from a magical time on TV, and the brothers Hudson, I believe, were underrated for their individual, and collective talents. For the price, this is a nice piece of nostalgia from the 1970s."
4,Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show,I enjoyed this DVD. The slapstick comedy and music is something not on shows today. Bring back the variety show. The Hudsons were funny.I really loved the Chucky Margolis bits. It may have been a Saturday morning show but it was more interesting than cartoons at least to me.
3,"Hey, Chuckie!","I remember this show as a kid. Even though it started out as a summer trial run replacing another variety show (I'm not sure which, either Tony Orlando or Sonny and Cher) it ended up as a saturday morning show. I pre-ordered it recently and look forward to a little nostalgic return to my childhood. The comedy bits were funny and the boys are pretty good as a band also (they had a hit single or two at the time). Rod Hull and the emu were hilarious! I hope they're leaving the songs on this ""Best of"" package. I'm only giving it 3 stars untill I can watch it and re-adjust the star rating."
2,"same old, same old ny donna hunnicutt",THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT WORTH PAYING FOR. JUMPS FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER WITHOUT IT MAKING SENSE. SHE LOVED HER MOM AND DAD; I DID MINE TOO. SHE LOVED HER HOME; I DO MINE TOO. SHE LOVED HER HERITAGE; I DO TOO. QUITE UN REMARKABLE
4,Great introduction into German,"Considering how language is best learned at the earlier ages of life, the textbook targets its intended audience (middle schoolers-high school freshman) very well. The book also includes mini-features which drive the student's focus to various regions of Germany, such as Berlin, Kiel, und Muenchen, and their customs. As my German I teacher said after completing the course, speaking to the whole class, ""I now feel comfortable that if you live in Germany for 6 weeks, you would not want to return to the United States."" Solid instruction in any class comes with not only a knowledgeable teacher, but a dependable textbook. My collegiate German studies stem from this textbook, and I could not have asked for a better beginning."
4,Excellent,"This is refreshingly straightforward: I guess in the early 1970s there were a few who decided they liked their heads just as they were, and didn't needBrain Salad Surgery. They loved their guitars so much, they kept off that sillyZiggy Stardustglamfacegreasepaint, and made some great rock and roll.The Raspberries were one of those bands, and on this album, the plan could not be simpler--or better: write three chord songs with melodic changes, get the distortion peddle, and crank your amp to 10. That is what this album doesThis album is ice water on a hundred degree city day: simple, clear as can be and as universally pleasurable. This reminds me of early Kiss, without the affectation, but the rock in perfect tactGet it."
3,Not what I expected.,"On the webpage, the image of this book is blue and it says 21st Century Edition. I have a version of this book from 1971, and I wanted the newer version that I saw listed on this website. However, I received a book that was from 1986. It looked exactly like the book I got from 1971, but in new condition. There are some rhythmic nuances in the older ""71"" version. I was hoping that 21st edition addressed this issues and modernized the rhythms, and maybe even some of the chords. But since it was the same book, I got the same nuances. Never the less, I must say I still enjoy this book tremendously, it has helped me to play hymns much better, and get a better understanding of gospel music.I still want to find that 21st centrury version that shown here. The seller is falsely advertising their book"
1,Not worth reading,"There's a regressively narrow perspective signalled through the use of the outdated trope of the ""dandy."" The dandy is a figure so cut off from community and place that it Romantically spirals away into never-never land. By using a gender framework, the argument seems more realistically grounded than it is."
3,Champagne Tastes,"Three great tracks on this album made it worth the purchase; Glass of Champagne, Girls Girls Girls, and Old Nikelodeon Sound (which coincidentally was the b-side to the Glass of Champagne single way-back-when). Glass of Champage and Girls Girls Girls are still played on the radio from time to time, highlighting the longevity of the songwriting and production by this band from the 1970s. The other tracks are reasonable to good, however they're arguably fillers provided to compile an album to showcase Sailor's two big hits and the body of work from the band over the decades. Worth the purchase to me to add some 70's gems to my library."
3,Bad desing,"Excellent game like all Uno's, but the Shrek desing not like me. Boring pictures and same characters in all cards."
1,The problem is Amazon doesn't have them in stock!!!!!!!,I tried to order a number of these for party favors for my three boys' birthday party...I did order a number (23) of them over 3 weeks ago...it was just today that Amazon said they did not have them in stock. Maybe they didn't want to pay the free shipping? Or just a very inaccurate inventory control system.
2,no liquid coming out of this liquidater,Maybe mine was broken when I got but at first it was awesome. Then it just started to disfuction and not work. I was dissapointed my $7.99 was a waste. Then I got the vaporizer which was only $4.99. So that's a much better deal.
4,Sniping gun,"This gun is a okay gun. If your child already has som guns, I would not recomend it. But if your child doesn't have any water soakers, make this their first. First off, my favorite part of this gun is it's range. The stream on the Liquidator nearly reaches forty feet! A nice accomplishment for a gun of its size. The second reason why I like this gun is because of its size. IT has a comfortable stable feel in your hand. Yet it is very satble and easy to hold with only one hand. This makes it the ultimate backup soaker (If only it had a strap!) On of the cons is the fast fill cap. (It should be called the ""fast spill cap). Also it's soakage power is way below average. Bt this is still a good soaker, just don't fight against people with larger more powerful soakers."
5,Older Books,I would like to say that we received these books so quickly. My Husband loves Grace Noll Crowell's Poems. We were afraid of them not being available after all this time. My Father-in-law could articulate a number of poems beautifully by memory. I am glad we have some of them on tape. Thank you.
4,Excellent!,"Out of all the review books that I have been thought this one was by far the most helpful. It really prepared me for the national exam! Like it says, it is plain and simple and very concice. It was very cost effective in comparison with any other review books. The practice tests on the CD were very much like the actual exam. I just think that they should have put more tests on the CD. In general, the best review book that I know of."
3,Helped but had many mistakes,"I found the book to be helpful w/ good review and short quizes. The CD tests were also good practice-- a bit more specific than the actual test.My big complaint w/ the book were the obvious and numbered mistakes on the quizes. Allen would give a letter answer w/ a mismatched answer. It made it very confusing and frustrating for me, having to look the answer up on my own."
4,Good camping addition,This reflector helps aim the light from your lantern in one direction. If you are looking for light to be aimed in a specific direction this will suit your needs.
4,"good, but wish it was a mirror surface","It fits on easily, and blocks the light from going to 1/3 of the circumference. But this is more of a light blocker and should be advertised as so, than a reflector. I wish it had a mirrored polished surface instead of the dull metal finish it comes with. Might try to polish it....Minus one star for dull surface."
5,it works,"looks kinda cheesy, works great. set it up in backyard and blocked light from keeping neighbors up."
2,EH....,"Does what it says, but blocks more light to the rear than it reflects forward. Probably won't use much unless i'm in a camp site that is close to others and staying up late."
3,Lantern Reflector - Foiled again,"There have always been a couple of these in the family, they're great.When not available , aluminum foil on one side of the globe works well also.Now, when your lantern is faced toward your fishing gear, you're not blinded.We've also made them from coffee cans and L-brackets"
3,one big flaw,"It's a pretty simple design with one big flaw: it doesnt fit in the hard case that came with my Coleman 285A lantern without disassembling it. Granted, disassembly is fast but it would have been easy to design this to fit inside a Coleman hard case. I think with a little bending I may be able to get it so it doesnt have to come apart every time it's packed up.I like it because it blocks light from other campers who dont want the bright light from a lantern. My girlfriend likes it because she can adjust the reflector so the bright light isnt shining on her while we play cards at night. It's a worthwhile purchase but it's one of those things that if it broke or was left at home you wouldnt miss it much."
2,bushnell binocular cleaning kit,"I like that it's compact and light, my only letdown was the pen, I thought it came with the cleaning head on the opposite end. I have purchased other pens like this (longer) that have a brush on one end and a cleaning head on the other, so I thought this was a compact version of it. It work's for me with my 12x36 canon's holder."
5,The funniest book ever,"I have read this book aproximately 25 times since I was twelve and it is without a doubt the funniest book ever. I recommend it for people who have had their first experience at summer camp. I would catagorize it as a boy fantasy novel, the story of someone who does amazing things"
5,A classic!,"I first read this book when I was 10 (I'm now 27), and I love it just as much now as I did then. In fact, this book started me collecting as many of Gordon's books as I could. GK has a gift for creating realistic characters and putting them in humorous situations without things getting silly. I have enjoyed all of his books that I've read, which either means he's really talented, or I'm REALLY immature."
5,Amazed at Reviews Matching My Experience 25 Years Ago,"I read this book 25 years ago and remember laughing out loud through out the entire book. My mother kept coming by to figure out what was going on. This was one of my favorite books of my childhood.I just picked the book up today for my son (a block of 8 Korman books), and dropped by here to see if my recollections of quality were there. I'm stunned by how many reviews match my memory.""Who is Bugs Potter"" also wowed me. My memories of that book are one influence that made me want the Rock Band game :). Loved the rest of the Bruno and Boots books as well.Now I just have to figure out what age to give it to my seven year old at. I've realized I have provided slightly too advanced books before, and am more cautious now (Magic Tree House, Droon and Captain Underpants)."
4,I Want to go Home!,"This is one graet book! It is about a boy named Rudy Miller, who is not very socialized, being sent away to summer camp. He does not take part in any sports, though he is a true Olympic champion back at home. He meets a shy friend, Mike Webster, who is a very bad liar, unfortunatly! With Mike as his companion, Rudy plans a million ways that he could escape this summer camp he dreads. In class, our teacher read ""I Want to Go Home"" to us. It was hilarious reading about Rudy and Mike's impossible escapes! Read this great story about Chip, the cabin councsiller, Harold, a mean campmate, Pierre, the arts and crafts teaacher, and of course, Rudy and Mike! You will love it!!!"
5,AMAZING,This is one of my favorite books from childhood and a book that everyone should read at some point. Buy this for any one who likes to read - and laugh.
5,I adore Gordon Korman,"and this would be one of my favourite books by him!it is laugh out loud funny and I read it over and over again.I am an adult, and I adore his books. If you are looking at buying something for kids who don't like to read, something like this should get them hooked!"
3,A good product at a reasonable price,"For a first time digital camera buyer, this kit contains just about everything you will need; case, recharger (AA), extra batteries (AA)and a memory storage wallet (memory stick).Throw in a few more batteries and some memory sticks and you are ready for some serious picture taking.I tried to price everything separately and compare to this package deal. You may be able to get the components cheaper, but when you look at the total cost and the amount of time needed to bargain shop, it was a heck of a lot easier to just grab this kit and go."
2,A little disappointed.,"Nothing really wrong with the product - Nickel plated Turkey bell - it is just that I was hoping for something a bit smaller. I have a medium sized dog and wanted a bell for her to wear on her collar to help me keep track of where she was, but this bell is too big and too loud. Guess it really is made for a larger animal."
3,Not as pictured,"I guess this bell is okay but not as pictured. I'm sticking with the Warner brass bear bell for dogs. It is less intrusive on the dog, has a pleasant yet long distance ring sound and just better all around bell"
5,"Nice looking, works well","I travel with the NexStar every week - at the bottom of a backpack or notebook case - and have never had a problem. In addition, the case and pass-through USB cable (allowing you to use another USB device on the same notebook USB port as the NexStar) are decent quality for this type of lower-cost item."
1,Not the best one.,"It had some problems with the screw to lock the case.Simply, it does not fit!!! The screw is too big for the hole.Personally, I'd rather recommend other type which does not require any screwing, for the sake of exchanging harddisk without the driver."
4,Very good.,Customer service was good. It is a slick unit. I liked the velvet bag for carrying it with you.
5,Excelent Choice,"I had tried another that was much cheaper, did not work and no support at all. I made an excellent choice when I bought this hard drive enclosure. This Vantec Nexstar is worth every penny, is Plug and Play, it's easy to connect drive to the enclosure. Comes with a very cool carrying case and easy to follow installation instructions."
4,Works great ... when it works.,"This didn't work at all on my old laptop's 80gb hard drive, but it works without any problems for my friend's drive, so we traded enclosures, and now we're both happy."
2,Not enough to pass the exam,After using this book for over three weeks I thought I was ready for the exam. I got a 700 on the exam but the required score was 766. I definitely was not ready after using only this book.
2,Very questionable...,"I found the information inconsistant, questionable and in some cases simply incorrect. I might recommend this as a first read however, DO NOT use this 'study guide' as your ONLY material. It seams to cover about 80% of the information that you will need... unfortunately, you need at least 85% to pass the exam!!!"
4,Well written book,"Like the test, this book was an essential part in me passing the Network Essentials exam. It had many descriptive protocol stack examples, good test scenarios, and indepth descriptions of all the OSI stack layer/corresponding equipment (routers, repeaters, etc) and protocols. Its shows you many tips, tricks, and test trap examples that will help you concentrate on the necessaries to passing this exam. Get the book!"
4,"very nice, holds lots of cds in a small footprint","ups delivered the box (which is pretty large) with a corner smashed, which included breaking one of the main side panels. i sent the manufacturer (AVthing in its place.com) an email. they replied within 15 min. telling me to throw away the broken piece and shipping me a new piece. it was a bit complicated to put together (took about an hour), but the instructions were very good. several people have commented on how nice it looks and that they need something just like it."
2,These are innovative?,"I was excited to read this book but was hoping for a lot more. Any suggestions on ideas that are actually new? I felt this book was a bit touchy-feely (which makes me as a customer feel queasy) and not hitting at real issues in customer service communication etc. This book might have had fresh ideas in 1977 but not 1997. Here's some of the ideas I found lacking (too many to list):- sensitivity training- estimate on the high side- make follow-up phone calls- laptop computer presentationI mean am I just cutting edge here? If you haven't heard of this stuff, you shouldn't be in business.I think I got about 5 ideas from this book I hadn't already considered, 2 of which were inspired by reading the book but not really talked about here."
1,A mute is supposed to do something!,"This design works fine on my fiddles, but on our double bass it doesn't even make a dent in the sound. I kept it because it's inexpensive and it can function as a string protector (if the strings get bumped where they go over the bridge, they may become damaged and later break), but as a mute it's worthless!"
5,Great Product!,"Removal of factory intake and install of the K&N was a quick and simple process. Took about 30 min total. Definite increase in gas mileage, and increase in performance. Dad's now getting an extra trip to work out of the HHR(Approx 60 mile commute one way) averaging 60+ mph."
5,Great Guitar Case for the price,I hate trying to carry a guitar around without a case. They get banged up and scratched. I needed one for the Ovation Guitar I purchased on Amazon. This case fits the guitar perfectly and was a good price. It is molded plastic and very durable.
5,One Amazing Light Bulb,"The last GE 38 Watt 2-D bulb lasted 10 years. Yes, 10 years! So try to find a fixture that uses this type of bulb and put it up. It *will* save you money in the long run. The bulb puts out plenty of light, so don't be put off by the low wattage (38 watts). Highly recommended."
1,Does not fit the 4 pin GR10q-4 light fixture,"This does not fit the 4 pin GR10q-4 light fixture as stated in the description. It's missing the slot found in the correct connection. I had problems trying to return it to the seller, but thanks to the Amazon A-Z guarantee, I was able to get credit for my purchase. Only after receiving my A-Z credit did the company try and contact me."
3,Quiet Magic,"Quiet Magic provides the reader with a real insight to what Nothern Minnesota and the Boundry Waters Canoe Area is like. Author Sam Cooks' writing style gives you a good mind set of what the wilderness is like up north here. If you are from a large city or down south this book may intigue you to take a vacation fishing up in the BWCA. My thoughts on this book are that it provides me a resident of the area that the author is writing about a eye opening experience to what beauty nature really provides for me. The book is writen in first person format, but it almost puts you in the scene with him giving you that feeling that I could be experiencing the same pleasure that Mr. Cook is. The book is easy reading and not very long and would recommend this book to just about anyone, weather your nich is outdoors or indoor."
3,Spanish-language magazine blurb for Delphi 6,"This is an interesting snapshot in time only because it offers a decade-old glimpse of the 'new' features of Delphi 6.Buy this only if you need a refresher on what was new for Delphi 6, up from Delphi 5, and/or if you need a baseline on what was deprecated in Delphi 7.[Don't forget to translate it to English.)Michael Hassler, PresidentLTA Systems, Inc."
2,Heads Up!,Don't get caught like me. This is indeed the same exact concert as Two Against Nature. I bought this because I was not happy with the video quality and now I have two of them.
3,Foreign label re-issue of existing DVD,"From the looks of it, this is a foreign label re-issue of the ""Two Against Nature"" concert DVD from several years back. No new footage, no new music, no reason to purchase it. If you want this DVD I'd suggest you buy the original release instead.5-star concert but 3-star DVD release for it being a re-issue and a head fake."
1,Steely Dan In Concert,This is an illegal bootleg of another concert not licensed by Steely Dan. You should not be selling it.
1,Not a 16x9 Widescreen Concert as advertised,"I am a huge Steely Dan fan and own everything they have put out.I assumed that since the DVD information said this was a ""widescreen"" concert it would be filmed and presented in 16x9.I was shocked that it is the same exact previously released concert ""Two Against Nature"" with the same 4x3 video very poorly stretched to 16x9!It looks horrible!I would send it back but it is not worth the hassle at $22.00.I would guess that the DVD is not even a licensed Steely Dan product.Rick"
3,Steely Dan in concert,The product itself was excellent which contained great songs with great compositions. The band is awesome but it would have been better if the product was available in an HD version. The video seemed a little fuzzy after being used to watching TV in high definition. Other than that it was great!
5,dvd music video,IT WAS GREAT THRILL TO WATCH THIS GREAT MUSIC BY STEELY DAN PLAYED LIVE!!! !!!!!!!!!! A J BIRDMAN
5,Very faithful to the book,"I got it for myself as an early Christmas present and am really glad I did. This production is very faithful to the original novel that was published in '67 (translations based on a later edition added interesting, but not essential, material). Bulgakov's Devil is more a deadpan agent of justice--doing God's dirty work perhaps--than the figure of evil more familiar to western audiences. Great perfromances by all; even those playing minor characters like Natasha and Hella made the most of their roles. The Devil's Ball was very sumptuous.The only downside is that the tape reflects the age of the original TV production (14 years), and I'd rather this were available on DVD, but if you're at all familiar with the book, this is a must-have."
3,Satisfactory,"It's not really a bush, nor is it large. However, it complements a terrarium nicely and has a suction cup to adhere to the sides of a tank. The bright green color really offset the more commonplace neutral tones that is often seen in fake terrarium plants."
5,Heart and Brain in your decision-making processes!,"I read this book after a few years of working as a sound editor and, I have to say, it really changed my perspective, giving me the opportunity to better define the structure of my decision-making processes.Considering both the technical and the creative aspects, the author defines some revolutionary methods that can help storytelling like Visual Maps, an extraordinary tool that gives you the opportunity to easily analyze the story, characters and mood of the sequence, in order to make the best choices for your sound editing and design.This is more than a technical book, actually one of the rare cases where the emotional aspect is even more considered, where theories are well defined and motivated, demonstrating how the relationship between the sound, voice, music and the audience can be as powerful as you decide."
5,A really useful student guide.,"I found this book to be very useful in conjunction with Michel Chion's Audio Vision, in an aim to grasp the concept of Sound Design. Wether it be used for writing an essay, or aiding you in planning a practical piece of sound design, this book is useful for students and professionals alike."
5,Well illustrated children's story,"This children's story is 29 un-numbered pages in a large format. The cover size is 9 x 12 inches. It is well illustated with large, full-color illustrations.It is a delightful retelling of the story of Rumpelstiltskin. In this version, the miller's daughter finds Rumpelstiltskin more attractive than the greedy king, and escapes with him to take up a new life on a farm. But, later, the king discovers their daughter, and kidnaps the daughter to try to force her to spin his straw into gold.The daughter is certainly not attracted to a greedy old king in his dotage, expecially one that her mother had already rejected when he was younger. But the daughter has plans of her own for rescuing the kingdom, and she is a lot smarter than the king.Like many good children's stories, this one has gone out of print. One could hope that the publisher will reissue this one."
4,Good book for management who want to implement TPM,"Good book if you're interested in (implementing) TPM. The book is very easy to read and does not keep repeating itself. Basically TPM is a(n) (big) extension on Keizen Teian and it might be useful to read a book on that subject as well, but is not necessary to understand the book. The book reviews all the steps how to come to a TPM system, especially the part on the preconditions is interesting, because based on my own experience this help your organization already a lot. The appendix contains a master plan for implementing TPM. In my opinion it is a good start but a more detailed checklist would have been better, but you can't have it all."
4,A Grand Pickup Indeed,"I admit...I had real reservations about a humbucking, in-the-soundhole pickup being able to reproduce acoustic sounds. But the Dean Markley ProMag Grand does exactly that.It accurately reproduces your acoustic guitar's own sound, without coloring or changing it. The lows are low, the highs are shimmering and even under flourescent lighting...no buzz!! With it's black and gold lacquer finish, it even looks great.The ProMag Grand has made me a believer. I give it four stars, only because I prefer a full size plug and some stress relief on the cord.Otherwise...its a five!"
4,Like it!,"This is a probably the best inexpensive pickup you can buy! The sound is not only good, but there is no hum like I have experienced from other brands I have tried. You can't go wrong with this one. The only con, is the cord. It is too stiff! It could be made a little softer and more flexible. Having said that, I would still recommend it!"
2,"Okay. Great sound, poor volume.","Using it on my Takamine f349, with Elixir Phosphor Bronze extra lights. This pickup amplifies the tone beautifully! Very flat response, no need to worry about mid or treble boosts. There is no equalization.The drawback is that it doesn't get very loud. Plugged into a P/A system, my buddy's undersaddle pickup drowns my sound out, the sound man has to crank the gain very high to get mine to a matching level, which isn't good. His Gain is at 10 oclock, Volume about 2/3, my Gain is at about 3 oclock, Volume maxxed. I don't want to keep causing a strain on the system.This is a great sounding pickup, it is just too quiet! An active soundhole pickup is the way to go. Someone told me the difference between my buddy's and my pickups is obvious. My guitar sounds good, straight acoustic with no power. The sound and the strings are great, but the pickup is a level below."
1,Highly disaappointed!,"Purchased as a Christmas gift in 2012. Now, the return window closed four days ago and the item no longer works -- at all. We've reserached online to find input on how to fix from home and nothing works. On top of that, we've called the company (Dean Markely) and when you press the number for customer service, you got a pre-recorded message stating the box is full and to try again later. Disappointing product for Amazon to carry when I've always had great luck with quality here. Further diappoaintment with Dean Markely. Not worth it to save money if the product breaks two months out.... Buyer beware."
5,Warm and Rich,Everything I was looking for. Warm rich tone through my amp keeping acoustic tone. Installed 1/4 inch female jack in my guitar to lose cord hanging out front of guitar.
5,Makes learning video poker painless,"I've heard and read so often that with the right strategy you can actually come out ahead if you play video poker, but until now, have not been able to get a handle on a strategy. This book helped me tremendously. Not only did I learn to play better video poker, I actually had fun reading the book and learning. The quiz format made it painless. I've read other video poker books, but I always found it a bit grueling working my way through all the charts and calculations. John Grochowski makes it easy. He uses anecdotes to illustrate certain points and they serve as great memory triggers. The book has already helped me improve my play at some of the casinos near my home. I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas. I recommend the video Poker Answer Book to anyone who wants a better understanding of the game and how to play it. Fine learning tool."
5,Good for every level,"I was very pleased with the Video Poker Answer Book. I'm no novice to vp, it's my favorite game in the casino. I play fast and, I believe I play well. Yet there was valuable information and tips that I picked up from John Grochowski's book. It's clear and concise and the format works. Thanks for teaching an old dog some new tricks."
2,Can't get Past the Errors,"I have very little confidence in this book, primarily because of the glaring error in the fourth paragraph on page Xiii of the Introduction. What am I to expect from the rest of the book. If the auther cannot state the basic premise properly, I have very little confidence in the accuracy of the details in the remainder of the book. He states, ""The days.....for Jacks or Better games that pay 9-for-1 on full houses and 6-for-1 on straights,...."""
2,Unnecessarity complicated,This book is supposed to explain video poker strategy. Instead it asks questions (if you knew the answers you would not have needed the book) and you have to go to a completely different section of the book to find the answers. It is time-consuming and not worth the effort of wading through all the different pages.
4,UK UFO TV,"Some good material for sure, but too much time spent on not so good material, i.e. footage of lights moving around in the sky and sitings that turned out to be explainable."
3,Dance Humbah,"My 3 year old daughter received this when whe was two and she stills likes to dance along to the silly sounds. It is very durable as she has thrown it all around. It moves up and down and all around, teaching her a few new dance moves!"
5,One of the best kids toys ever,I may be 15 But when I saw the commercial fo this i knew that I just Would love to have one so ibought one yester day aug 7th And i've been playing with it ever since i got it it's become my life soon after i bought thentire collection of boohbah figures now if i like it at the age of 15 a 3 year old will probaly like it too
1,Boring plus it didn't last!,"We bought this for our daughter when she turned 1. She loves the show and she kept playing with it in the store. However, once we brought it home she rarely played with it. She enjoyed dancing to it, but the music stopped quickly and she had a hard time turning it back on so she would lose insterest. It's only been 6 months and now the thing won't work. My husband is pretty handy, but the thing doesn't come apart for him to try and fix. It finally went out to the trash today."
2,Ugly little Boobah,"I had never heard of Boobah until my friend gave this to my son last Christmas (he was 17 months old at the time) and as soon as I saw it I didn't like it. Then we heard it and this cemented my initial impression. Its way too loud, songs are too short, and the farting noise is just not my cup of tea. My son didn't want anything to do with it and now, 6 months later, it just collects dust in his room. If you want a fun interactive plush toy, I recommend the Happy Ears Eeyore. He is adorable, sings two full songs and flaps his ears when you press his foot. We love it as much as my son does. :)"
3,My Child Loves It,This is a great toy. My son loves this toy. The toy moves it head around and my son does the same thing. When it plays music my son loves to dance to the music. I think it is a great toy to play with.
4,Nice stand to match my Mirage Omnisat v2 SAT.... but,"It comes with a floor plate, a mounting plate and the stand poles. The poles are aluminum and the floor plates are cast iron. The mount plate is also steel. It matches my black platinum SATs. I also like how I can wire the speakers through the tube of the poles then out the top back of the stand.Now, the only complaint I have on this is a bit light. I wanted it to be around 20lbs each stand to provide weight/secure to the ground. But I think its about 6-10 each.. but no where close to 20lbs/stand. The base is wide enough to support it, but I just wish its heavier. But all in all, its a stand build for the Mirage Omnisat V2 sat."
3,Clumps,"It isn't the best but it isn't the worst. Dries in clumps, these little annoying balls of stuff on the skin Smells nice and hypoallergenic just leaves a mess"
1,rip off,when this came in they were small trial size bottles - for $45.00 it was totally off price and picture was VERY misleading
3,Lotion Collection,Was not pleased with this item and would not order these again.It was not what I had read it would be. Does not have the bang thatit protrayed on TV.
4,love it,I love this book!!! Very helpful for pre-nursing students and nursing students. It reads as if someone is talking to you about the subjects.
