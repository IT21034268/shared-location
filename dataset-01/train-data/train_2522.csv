3,Cooking from the Heart: 100 Great American Chefs Share Recipes They Cherish,"Some receipes were good, a few were okay and some were plain, common sense or not worth the effort. But the money went to a chartible cause."
4,Cooking from the Hearts of great chefs,"Cooking from the Heart is a splendid look at some of America's finest chef's and a peek at some of the events that made them who they are. More than a cookbook, it should be read in the easy chair AND the kitchen. It also shows a common bond chef's have in the fight to end hunger by donating their talents through Share Our Strength, one of the nations leading anti-hunger organizations."
2,Returned Immediately,"I went back and forth between the 4 star Henckel's knife and the Wusthof Classic. I went for the Henckel's due to the lower price. As soon as I opened the package, I was planning on sending it back. There is not a full tang, the handle felt like cheap plastic, the overall knife felt flimsy with no sense of balance. I have been cooking for 20 years, using mostly Chicago Cutlery which is decent but not durable. I like the weight of those knives but the edges get chewed up after a few years. I then ordered the Wusthof Classic the next day. Immediately after picking up that knife, it is clear it is in a whole different class. The knife has a full tang, riveted, solid handle. There is some weight to the knife but it is so well balanced it is not noticeable when in use. In the end, the Wusthoff cost $30 more but in my opinion, well worth the extra cost."
3,Less steel than there used to be.,"I bought this knife recently to go along with the 8 inch version which I purchased 18 years ago and have been happily and extensively using since.When the new 10"" version arrived I was disappointed to see that it felt flimsy for its size, weighing approximately the same as the 8"" (233 vs. 229 grams). The spine on the old knife is nearly twice as thick near the handle, making it feel quite solid for tasks like smashing garlic. When doing this with the new 10"" knife, the blade gives a bit, feeling almost as if it might break. I find myself not using this new knife."
5,Reading Zollie is about having fun and feeling good!,"I just got Zollie Goes West a few days ago and I have read it quite a few times. It was fun to read and to learn about making new friends who look and act differently. Even though Zollie the zebra, Danny the donkey, and Herbie the horse are different, they learn that they really are more like each other and they all become friends. It took Herbie longer to understand that to make a friend you first have to be and act like a friend. I will try a little harder to make a new friend when I meet someone different from me.Zollie showed me that it is okay to be yourself and that the world would be very boring if we all were the same.Jess 11"
5,"I'M ""EARNING MY STRIPES""","Mom, Nicole, and I met you at Cinemark where you signed our book and talked with us. We all read your book that night and we talked about different types of friends. I know I will be a better friend now because I did not like the way Herbie was with Zollie and Danny. I think I will read Zollie again and again so I don't forget how to treat others. Thank you for Zollie and I hope I did earn my stripes.Megan"
5,MY FAVORITE BOOK,ZOLLIE GOES WEST JUST BECAME MY FAVORITE BOOK. I got it at the hospital gift shop for my cousin. She wasn't feeling too good so I read it to her. We both liked it a lot and it helped make her smile. We bought another one when we left the hospital and I read it when I got home. I really like how this book makes me feel.S.T. 12
5,Zollie Goes West,Zollie is a good book for all ages. Zollie teaches kids many lessons that could help kids in life. I would give zollie a A+. Zollie should be known around the world by kids of all ages.
2,NO Protection for item being shipped,Received my book shoved in my apt mailbox. There was no backboard or anything to protect it from being bent or thrown around. Will not purchase again.
4,Great Game,"This game is wonderfull. The graphics are great and the reality is great as well. The only bad thing is all you do is fight, no wlaking around to do other stuff,and that it is hard to see the other guys in 3-4 player mode. {P.S: This games is not for 7 year olds because of it's violence.} Over all this game is 4 out of 5!"
4,Well worth the time if you want to understand the French.,"I was searching for a non-fiction book to read before my trip to Paris. I like understanding the cultural/historical aspects of a place before succumbing to the sights and beauty. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to do this as well. It's well written and easy to read, not bogged down too much in the history of the monarchs and Napoleon. I feel that I understand the French much better today and their position in the socio-economic world."
1,Flexibel (GER) Carving Knife,"I was very dissapointed with this knife. I bought it to carve turkey. It is flexibel (GER) but a poor performer. I do own two other Henckels, the Pro S models and they are Wonderful. I suggest paying more and getting the Pro S models."
4,"Good case, good price","This is an excellent aluminum hard case for the Palm m500 series. The pros: the case is molded to the shape of the handheld, it fits snug (like Palm's hardcase for the V series) so there's not any ""bulk"". It fits easily into a shirt pocket. The case is sturdy, and it has an opening in the back to make inserting expansion cards easy. It also has a soft thin neoprin liner to prevent scratches to the handheld. The flaw: the hinge on the case doesn't have the ""stops"" like the old Palm V hard case did, so the lid is really loose when it's opened. Overall, this is a good protective hard case. I only wish Palm had manufactured it, as they did for the Palm V. Palm's aluminum hardcase for the m500 series is bigger and bulkier than this one; plus it is wa-a-a-a-a-ay overpriced."
2,Not Good at All,My biggest complaint with this case is that it does not protect the unit from accidential activation. The palm is activated when it recieves a mild jolt in the case. I have completely lost power twice since I purchased it on 8/20. I would not recommend this product for that reason alone.
3,The premise of this record - to revisit the 'hogs finest,"without reworking their overworked classics - can only commend it to the faithful. This recent series of medleys of songs from their golden age, recorded live by axeman T.S.Mcphee with drums and bass, avoids Cherry Red, any parts of Split or Garden and dwells on a catalog which probably deserves to remain undisturbed. One day someone will do a bang-up retrospective (a single disc, might I suggest) which I will be happy to rave about, because it will contain a cleaned up Cherry Red, truly a lynchpin of the Brit Blooz Boom. If you already own it on CD and want less of the same, go for this."
1,Funding Evil?,"A waste of space, with out of date (for 2002) information concerning the IRA who by 2002 had decommissioned, also bas info on African diamond trade, plus a heavy Zionist bias. Not worth the money, and after the Turner Diaries the worst book that I have ever purchased from the U.S. NOT RECOMMENDED buy something else. Rated zero stars. ""Ghostrider"" [I have been to Afghanistan, most of the Arab world :Iran,Iraq,Egypt, Libya, Saudi, Kuwait; South and Central America, mainly the no-tourist places, as well as ""Red"" China (c 1976) and a few ""nasty"" places in Africa, (in no special order) Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Angola."
4,Has a drawback.,I bought this game for my family but we can't play it because the screen swings so much that we get motion sickness. It may be a cute game but none of us can play long enough to find out.dizzy and sick Mom
5,"GREAT GAME FOR YOUNG CHILDREN - GOOD, CLEAN FUN!","I have three girls ages 8, 7 and 6. They absolutely love this game as do my husband and I. It's simple enough for the girls to figure out yet has quite a few challenges which they need my husband and I to help them out. I highly recommend this game for young gamers (teenagers will probably be bored). The graphics look just like a cartoon with plenty of kangaroos, frogs and other animals popping around the screen. My girls especially like sliding down the water slide avoiding obstacles. They play this game over and over again."
1,"great game, bad condition.","the game came completely unplayable. i put it into the game system, (not saying brand names) and the game plays up until it shows the main character before the opening cut scene, then bam! cannot read disc. buffing did not help. neither did washing the game. so long story short the product came unuseable."
2,Same Old Same Old,"Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Jack and Daxter, Chrash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet and Clank, Zapper the Cricket, Frogger (the recent ones), and the list goes on. They are all the same! Sure there may be a few differences in style and gameplay, but its all the same thing, find the items, save something, collect coins, jewlels, or whatever, and use the same basic jump and attack on a bunch of the same enemies walkin around. Ty is simply the new addition to this little family, and quite frankly, it has gotten very old. The minor inovations aren't near enough to put this one up and away from the rest. But if clich√© adventure games are your thing, then have a blast. But for the rest of us, something new please."
3,FANS OF 3-D PLATFORMERS WILL FIND LITTLE NEW HERE.,"I HAD THIS GAME FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AND TURNED IT IN. TY IS CERTAINLY CUTE. HOWEVER HIS ADVENTURE IS PRETTY BASIC. YOU GET TO COLLECT THINGS, RUN, JUMP, SWIM, DEFEAT ENEMIES WITH DIFFERENT BOOMARANGS AND USE YOUR BITE ATTACK. THIS GAME IS BASICALLY YOUR RUN OF THE MILL 3-D PLATFORMER. DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS ISN'T A BAD GAME. I'M SURE IT'S SOMEONES FAVORITE GAME RIGHT NOW. MY POINT IS THERE ARE A # OF OTHER ADVENTURE GAMES FOR GAMECUBE THAT ARE BETTER THAN THIS ONE."
1,Bad Review,i never recieve this product and i order this for my daughter b-day and i was mad it never came im glad i got my money back
2,Long simmering food burned on bottom,"Got this to make homemade applesauce for canning. It simmered for about an hour. Applesauce was burned on bottom of pan. I was surprised as I expected performance similar to a piece of All Clad I am proud to own. My bad -- there is a reason it's cheap. Also, I agree with other reviewers: the welded-on handles are a little disconcerting when picking up 11 quarts of boiling applesauce."
5,I would recommend this product....,This is a very nice heavyduty stock pot...Well made and sturdy...I've been using Farberware products for many years and I'll continue to use them because they offer great guality.
1,Poor quality,"I researched stock pots for a while, and based on the reviews here decided on this Farberware stock pot. After using it one time to make stock, I noticed that the top layer of the inside bottom of the pan was spotty. On closer inspection it appeared that the surface metal had come off in patches (into my stock!). I returned this pan and ordered a replacement. However, the second pan did the same (not as bad though) and so that is being returned too. I'll continue me research and choose a different manufacturer. I'm very grateful that Amazon will take returns and their process is so easy."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SUNFLOWER SEEDS,"SHIPPING WAS PROPMPT, BUT WHEN I OPENED THE BAG & TRIED IT, IT WAS ALL STALED. I COULD NOT EAT IT. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
1,Snakeoil?,"I bought this product because I had high levels of ammonia in my aquarium. The description said it would eliminate the ammonia and ""age"" the tank. It did neither one. As a matter of fact, I could detect no difference whatsoever in the aquarium once the product was used.So, I don't know what's in ""Ultimate"", but it did not work for me at all. Apparently I spent $40 for nothing.After Ultimate did nothing and my problems hadn't been solved, I found out about a product from drtimsaquatics.com called ""One and Only"". This stuff did everything that Ultimate did not. (I have no relation whatsoever to this website or product; I just know it works)If I could have given Ultimate no stars, I would have, but the system made give it at least one."
4,Wusthof is Better,A better selection in this style knife is the Wusthof with Kullens blade and Grand Prix handle.
3,Sponges are very small,"Thought the Sponges were a little larger. Two of them are not 3"". Could have gotten them at the pets store for less."
3,Mold?,"I ordered 2 bags. I don't know if one package was moldy or if t had pebbles in it or what? But one package was riddled with hard, white chalky stuff. It seems like such a hassle to return anything that I just tossed it and moved on. The other bag was great! I jut can't give it 5 stars when the other bag wasn't."
3,Nice but not in love,"Ordered this as a wedding gift and it was well made, but only had the floral pattern - no deer. I understand you cant get the same image off of every spool of fabric, but a more concious effort to include an image similar to the display would have made me love this."
3,Fun for a little while.,"I'm still on the fence about this game; that's why I've given it a 3. The graphics are really great and the sound is pretty good too. The downside to this game was that the levels were all the same, except they got a bit more challenging each time. After a while, it gets pretty boring. The characters are rather amusing and the weapons you get... a stapler, cluster duck, etc.. are pretty funny too. I think this is a good game to rent, but not own."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I read all the other reviews on this site and others. They said that this game was no good. I didn't believe them, so I bought it. Well...It's okay, it just didn't hold my interest. The commercials were funny, and I enjoyed the sick sense of humor, but I stopped playing it after completing two boards. I just got bored of it.If you want lots of excitement and action, DON'T buy this game. If you want to kill some time, rent this game first."
4,Whacked!,"Long story short:Story mode is amazingly funGame is best enjoyed with multi-playerNot as fun alone, by far."
5,Still one of the most fun games for xbox,"Gotta love party games - this is one of the best. Hilarious and wicked, the game play is great with friends or without.I pulled this out a few weeks ago after not having played it for YEARS - had a blast."
2,Not Enough Fun,"I returned this one two days after I bought it.The game is an interesting concept. And it's fun for a while. But even though there are quite a few characters, weapons and power-ups, it still won't hold your attention for more than a day in single player mode.In Xbox Live mode it will keep your interest up for a little longer (not much).The core problem is that the action is so fast that you feel like success has more to do with luck than any skill or strategy. Although your skill will improve, you still never really get to feel like you're in control of what's going on around you.Also, it is totally inappropriate for kids (kids under 21 in my opinion). Not just the topless character, but the language and movie clips are also often in poor taste.Fuzion Frenzy is a better party game.Halo and Unreal Championship are (by far) better action games.I think you'll only like this if you use Xbox Live (which I did) and enjoy a sense of panic, confusion and irreverence at every moment of a game."
4,FINALLY! a game for the whole family... or not.,"i love this game! all you need to do is get some friends, and start playing and i promise you will love this game of pandimoniom! in this game you can get yolk-o-matics,staple gun,baseball bat, hammer, grenades that look like ducks,and loads of cool power-ups! like you can switch bodys with someone else and lunge them off a cliff, turn the map up-side down, and much, much more! NOTE TO ADULTS: this game is not for kids! the language and violance is pervasive, the move clips contain certian content only thirteen year-olds and up would understand,and so i would only reccomend this game to us older gamers!thanks for reading!"
4,Chris's Game Reviews: Whacked! and naked,"Ok, here's the situation. You just got Xbox Live and you want a good game. Whacked! is the game to get. As most people have heard from Official Xbox Magazine discs that you get a huge prize in the end. You can pick from Lucy, Toof, Lucky, Charity, Lance, Otto, and Eugene. You can unlock many weapons, and many game types. Trophy game where you hold the trophy for 60 seconds and stars where you get a certain amount of stars. This is a great game! Next is Kung Fu Chaos or Unreal."
5,Addicting game,"this is such an addicting game. it is sooooo fun to play with a friend. If i could I would rate this game 1000000000000 out of five, it is the best. The first part is bad, but it got a lot better. Go buy it"
3,Great Company.... Not So Great Range,"I bought this Fixture because it was rated so well on Amazon & elsewhere. Mine has a range of only about 15 feet and doesn't detect quite so well from straight in front (Middle of driveway). Also, be careful when tightening screws holding unit to back plate..... That said, Steinel really has offered to stand by their product and has offered advice and a direct replacement for faulty motion detector. Steinel has really shown a great customer service commitment with my issues."
4,Great alternative to motion detector floodlight,"It's always a pleasure to see a product work as advertised, although more expensive, which is not a negative factor. This infrared sensor floodlight was easy to install and set up. Works great on night setting with a person approaching the light fixture from either side or straight on. Did not need to use sensor shields. A person cannot avoid activating the light by walking ""under"" the fixture. The only reason 5 stars was not awarded was I need to see some time pass...Have only had it installed for about 3 weeks. Completely satisfied so far and I highly recommend this product."
4,Very good except for cheap lamp sockets,"Only up a couple of days, but I agree with the other reviews. Excellent and very wide adjustments of the light aiming. The directions could be clearer in indicating that you have *two* adjustments for each light.Works fine with CF floodlight bulbs.Only problem, as a couple of other reviewers point out, is with the cheap lamp sockets. Most lamp sockets have a threaded metal sleeve that contacts the outer part of the lamp base at many places. On this unit, the threads are molded into the plastic; the only electrical contact for the outer part of the lamp base is a small and rather limp brass strip that doesn't always touch the lamp base. I had to unplug the unit and use a tiny screwdriver to bend the brass strip contact outward so that it would reliably contact the lamp base.So far, this unit is a lot better than the now-discontinued X-10 model. My X-10's became flaky in operation over time."
1,AWFUL!,"Do NOT - under any circumstances order this worthless ""light"". The effective range - when properly mounted at 8' is less than 20 feet. Period. Regardless of adjustment, you will NOT get 20' range from this junk. Additionally, the ""adjustable"" arms adjust in only one direction: flopping and pointing straight down at the ground.I read all the reviews here and elsewhere on this junky light. Reviews were fair. SOMETHING has changed. Fair warning: if you want a good motion-detecting light, look SOMEWHERE ELSE."
1,I WISH KARL WILLETS WAS HERE,"This is by far the worst Bolt Thrower CD. Karl Willets would be hanging his head down in shame if he heard this. Karl ruled on vocals and the new vocalist doesn't make this seem like a Bolt Thrower release. The songs seemed liked they were thrown together and the structure of songwriting is lacking,plus without Andy on drums I find this release boring and there is so many other Death Metal releases in 2001 to check out instead of this."
5,Bolt Thrower keeps it coming,"Bolt Thrower has been my favorite band for years, and they certainly haven't disappointed me with this release. The music has a perfect balance of heavy, skull-pounding metal and growling vocals, with enough melodic variety to keep it from becoming monotonous. The band continues its war theme with some great lyrics to boot. This is a more complex CD than ""Mercenary"", but ""...For Victory"" remains my favorite. If you like extreme, fast, and heavy metal, Bolt Thrower is the right choice. Check out Krisiun's ""Conquerors of Armageddon"" as well."
4,Worth Every Penny,"I had not even heard of Bolt Thrower before purchasing this album. I bought it on a whim. It has proven itself worth every penny. The songs on this album are guitar-driven with low, growling vocals. The theme of the album is war, and the guitars and vocals combine well to give a sense of the relentless, grinding, destructive force that is modern warfare. While all songs follow the same theme, they do so with enough originality between them to keep the album fresh throughout its duration. Just buy it and listen."
1,save yer money,"This book was a horrible portraly of Courtney Love, esp compared to Poppy Z. Brite's book. I thought that it would be a good read, but its not worth it. It is a biased point of view with most of the information coming from an ex-boyfriend who obviously cant be trusted. save your money and if you want to read a good book about Courtney, get 'the real story' by Poppy Z. Brite or 'grrrls' by Amy cantrememberherlastname."
2,"Interesting, but not very accurate","This book is an entertaining, fast read, but judging from the factual errors that litter the pages, it's questionable as a reliable source of Courtney-lore, and should probably be seen as ""historical fiction"" at best. The book is not ""anti-Courtney"", per se, but it does give an astonishing amount of space to Rozz Rezabek, the whining former boyfriend whose claim to fame is saying that Courtney destroyed his career in the hatchetjob ""documentary"" ""Kurt and Courtney"". At some points it seems that it should be titled ""Rozz Rezabek: King of Crybabies"" instead. There aren't any interviews with people who are currently close to Courtney. Compared to Poppy Z. Brite's very detailed and beautifully writen bio, this one is very low-end."
4,"excellinet, paints a very realistic scene of courtney and he","I really liked how this story is writen, the writer obviously has a lot of talent, nad the way that she portrays courtney is so real and honest, she doesnt completley bash her, bubt she straight up tells the truth! Not many writers aer willijng to do that, especially for courtney"
5,"Got it, love it!","Gotta love it. It is not something you want your children to know that you own, but it is a great way to keep up on what day it is. If you are a reader of novels, you will enjoy a Harley fiction ""THE SECOND COMING OF AGE"" by: C. Vedrine"
2,old book--dry and dated,"As the leading civilian Secret Service expert, I very modestly recommend this book, mainly for the colector out there; very dated and dry. Not much else to say-get it if you want a full library on the subject."
4,Better Than Normal Paring Knife,"I have 3 Henckels Four Star paring knives. Ironically, the standard paring gets the least use. The granny paring one is the most versatile because of its pointed tip. You can get in smaller areas easier such as for coring. The thinner-width tip means it can slice curves easier. I would get this paring knife it's your only one. If not, I love my straight-edge (Kudamono) paring knife the best."
1,"With luck, this will stay out of print","With any luck, Stranger Suns will stay out of print. I picked it up because I'd been so impressed with Zebrowski's collaboration on the Killing Star, but this was a complete disappointment.The alleged plot starts out with some similarities to Norton's Time Trader's series, where humans discover ancient starships buried on Earth. The difference here is that the time travel is between different realities, instead of linearly through historic time. A group of miserable excuses for scientists start to explore, and the plot completely derails. Threads start and die with no discernable plan. The ""scientists"" make wild speculations based on no data and conclude they are facts. The ending comes 150 pages too late, and resolves nothing. What a waste!"
1,Too strange,"The lack of coherence in this novel is as stunning as the alien technology our heroes explore. There are enough plot elements going here to fill a shelf of books; few of the lines are tied up with any satisfaction. All in all, a deeply frustrating book."
5,Great product Spandage,"This is a wonderful product. I received it very quickly. Thanks so much. I take a lot of steroids for asthma and it causes my skin to bruise and tear easily. Neosporin on a telfa pad, held in place with spandge allows for faster healing in that it is comfortable and the air is allowed to circulate which speeds up the healing process. Thanks so much."
5,best paige book yet!,I have read 5 of the Paige mysteries and I couldn't put this one down! You don't need to read them in order to enjoy this one.
3,"Less history, more mystery","O.K., not the best of the series, but acceptable. A little more development of the characters and less focus on historical ""teaching"" would have made for a faster moving more engaging story."
2,Poor Showing,"I've enjoyed this series from the beginning, but this latest mystery from Robin Paige (husband and wife team) rates way below the others. Not only is there NO mystery whatsoever, the book is chock full of filler material -- beautiful descriptions, yes; interesting villagers, but clearly not much happening in their lives for any subplots; and a German spy who tinkers around in one disguise or another, waiting for the protagonists to make their next move instead of providing some intrigue. I hope the authors spend far more time plotting the next book in this series or they'll lose me for good."
3,Medal of honour x box,"PLAYED TIS GAME TO THE END ON PC BOUGHT IT FOR THE X BOX TOO, GAME PLAY IS OK GOOD FUN BUT THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY POOR INDEED, YET SPLINTER CELL GRAPHICS BOTH ON PC AND X BOX ARE EXCELLENT, IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED MEDAL OF HONOUR THEN YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED , AND YOU MAY FIND THE GRAPHICS OK , SOME PARTS OF THE GRAPHICS REMIND ME OF PLAY STATION 1 EEK SORRY, SAW THE DEMO ON PS2 AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE THAT, BUT NOWARE NEAR DIFF GAME TOO IT SEEMS, TRY GHOST RECON , COOL"
3,A good renter,"This was a fun game and well worth the $6 I spent renting it. There are lots of cool weapons, good graphics, great sound, and a great story. However, the there are several problems with the game. 1. On normal mode, I beat this game in a week, (6 sittings at 2-3 hours a piece). 2. The gaming engine leaves much to be desired. I'm not sure it is a real 3-D engine. You can't walk under a soft body like a flag or banner like you can in Splinter Cell. If some one gets in front of you in a hallway, for example, you cant get around them. The world seems awfully static. 3. The controls, while good, could be better. On the plus side, I think there is room for re-playability. So, if you actually buy this game, even though you will beat it in a week, there will still be hours of fun ahead of you. I give it a 3 because it is good but not really great."
1,"Boring, don't bother","After playing Halo for the past year, this game is slow, hard, and boring. Save your money, get Halo if you don't already have it, and look for a better game."
2,A VERY SUCKY GAME,I recnetly rented this game on xbox and this is by-far the worst game i have ever played but hey dont get me wrong the game play is ok not to good but OK.Still the grahpics suck the worst if i was u i wudnt buy it nor rent it its not wrth your money ur better off going for Lord of the Rings 2:The two Towers wich is schedueled to come out on the 1 of january i my self have already perorder i suggest u do the same
5,Great,Great game for as old as it is. Not as good graphics as new Xbox360. But very fun. Love them WWII games.
3,"Not bad, though very ""Playstation-2 ish""","This game has a great story line, and much action. Sometimes very intense. The only problem with it is it is like playing a game on playstation 2 - in other words the characters you control are somewhat difficult to control and the characters in the game in general look and react plain stupid.If this game was built to take advantage of the capabilities of the xbox, and the graphics and characters looked and reacted as you would hope on the xbox, it would be a great game. But having the feel of a childish game within a mature story, it is a big dissapointment.Maybe a second version will be released with more realistic characters....."
2,Too old,"Bought it used and after about 3 hours was too bored to play anymore. The only way this game would be any more linear was if they made it a 2D side-scroller. There is very little decision making or strategy involved compared to today's games. It is essentially a walk down on an obvious path that leads to different shooting galleries. Might have been something back in its day, but no longer."
2,What?,"This game was such a let down. I was excited to get a good FPS and got a flop. The chopy movements, lack of camra mobility and poor graphics really made this game stink. Knowing what an Xbox is capable of, aka. Splinter Cell, Halo, Marrowwind, this is like playing Pong all over again. I was impressed with the historical fact of the game, but if I wanted history I would turn on the History channel. The charactors die so slowly you could run and make a sandwhich before they would hit the ground. Also lack of interaction between charactor and enviroment is so bad, I mean you can't even walk through laundry hanging out to dry, which this game is. Reloading is slow, graphics are poor, RENT it only if your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice are all ready gone from the shelves."
5,This game is awesome,"Medal of Honor: Frontline is the best game I have ever played. The graphics are totally real, the music is cool, and the whole game is fun.There is a wide selection of tight weapons and explosives from a Colt .45 to a Shotgun. There are many grenades, and the guns have heavy fire. The gameplay is very fun, the action of landing on Omaha Beach to the feel of infiltrating aq Nazi camp in Holland. The characters are very normal, they talk their feelins just like a real person. The action is cool, too. The music fits very weel with the situation in the game. For example: In the level Yard by Yard, where you are in a town in Holland occupied by Nazis, when you are in the neighborhood the music is my favorite in the game, with the intense caction when the Germans are sniping at you from a high building. I know I've said a lot of things, but just to sum it all up, I think this is greatest game ever created."
5,A Game that you can't Stop Playing!!,"Medal of Honor: Frontline is one of the best 1st person shooters that I have played. I have Medal of Honor: Allied Assault for the computer and I love it. I decided to rent Medal of Honor: Frontline for the Xbox. It turned out to be an awesome game and it was worth the money! Medal of Honor: Frontline is a game that has 6 single-player missions and each mission has about 3 or 4 levels each. There are more levels in Medal of Honor: Frontline than in Halo (another great shooter) so you have a better variety of scenerios to play in. Take on the role of Lt. Jimmy Patterson and go from Omaha Beach to a Ho-IX (jet fighter) hanger. Also, Medal of Honor: Frontline has all-out multiplayer battles where you play against your friends with different sets of weapons and in different scenerios. Finally, the sound is as realistic as it gets and the graphics are very clear. In conclusion, anyone who likes a 1st person shooter, would just get addicted to this game!!"
4,MoH is definitely worth buying!,I've only rented this game a few days ago but I can already unequivocally recommend this game. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning. It really immerses you in the sense of playing out Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. During the storming of Normandy you even have fellow soldiers getting sick. It is astounding the attention to detail. I have not played HALO as I just got my xbox but this is the best FPS I've come across in a while.
3,Medal of Honor Frontline - Amazing Visuals,"This game (with the exeption of the first board) has been rebuilt entirely from the PC version. It has amazingly stunning and authentic visuals, plus vintage weaponry and styling. I am rating the title a 3 only because it does not take full advantage of the X-Box hardware. While the environments are very well detailed, the gameplay channels you through specific paths and you are not allowed to explore or utilize strategy as part of the game. The enemy AI is also quite low compared to Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell - which are more modern combat games. That said, it is still very fun to play and if you are a fan of the PC version you will love the re-vamped X-Box title."
5,I love it! I'm a 10 year old....,It is amazingly cool and realistic. The one improvement that they could make to this game is adding a cooperative mode. I recommend Medal of Honor because it is so real and the graphics are good. They even have the real guns from the WWII era including the tommy gun.
4,4 stars possibly less.....,"This games is very fun. Its kind of like playing Halo or 007:Agent Under Fire. EXCEPT its NOT as good as Halo but its BETTER than Agent Under Fire. The worst part is that the multiplayer levels are not as big as I had hoped, and they don't have the stationary guns that you can you against the Nazi's in single player. I reccomend buying this game only if you are sure you'll like this type of game. If you're looking to try a new first person shooter, I reccomend renting this instead."
5,My Mom Loves It,"This is a very good quality item from Farberware. It's strong and cooks really well. The price was/is excellent, too. A stockpot such as this is one of those essentials you must have around the house. As I said earlier, my mom loves it and she's picky when it comes to cookware... so most of you probably will enjoy it too!"
1,wish I had known it had an aluminum core before I bought it.,No where in the description did it say the core was aluminum. I was under the impression it was all stainless steel. Wouldn't have bought it if I had been aware of that.
5,Great deal!,"I almost brought a tent that cost 3 times as much as this one, but lucky for me I found this one on Amazon. Have used it several times, once through 2 day of constant rain, but stayed dry. Also very easy to set up. Great bang for the dollar."
5,Worked well for us,"After a TON of research, we bought this tent to eventually use on an overnight backpack trip. We are normally car campers who recently got into backpacking, and we will some day go on an overnight backpacking trip. We took this one to a campground to give it a try on a cold, rainy weekend. The tent fit two average sized adults without a problem, and we stayed very warm and dry. The only issue we had was unzipping the rainfly. The first time we unzipped it after it was raining, a bunch of water dripped into the tent. This can be avoided if you're really careful, but sometimes that isn't so easy (like when you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night). Otherwise, we were very pleased with this tent, and we can't wait to give it a try out on the trail."
3,GREAT TENT bad amazon,"This tent is actually fantastic. The review is directed at Amazon. So.... 3 weeks ago, and basically forever, this tent was on sale at Amazon for ~$76.00. Then two weeks ago the price goes up to $88.00; and I know because I had it in my cart. And I knew it; must be going to put it on ""sale"" for black friday or cyber-monday. Tsk tsk Amazon."
3,Good enough for its intended purpose,"It's a good enough tent if you are camping out for the weekend or a few days. It doesn't really fit two normal sized individuals comfortably, but they can both fit. If you want value for money, it's an ok product. I also have the Eureka! Apex Tent, which i personally think is a better tent."
2,No privacy....additional floor is needed,"It's a light tent but you have to carry additional floor to protect the thin original floor, maybe for two seasons tent but for three seasons tent?? either privacy and the ""half moon"" on the rainfly just where the head is put. I'm going to return it and never recommend to a friend"
4,Looks good so far...,"Just unpacked and pitched. It does help to read the instructions to realize just how simple this tent is to put up.I had a Timberline 2 person for years, and used it in torrential downpours without even a minor leak. Have high expectations for the Apex. Really like the roomy vestibule and large door on each side of the tent.Only downside I see are the fiberglass poles, plus would recommend for individuals 6' or under. Not sure how my long sleeping bag is going to work.All that having been said, looking forward to taking the tent into the woods."
5,Stood up well in high winds,"I spent one night in this tent in my backyard to test it out. It just so happened that we had unusually high winds for us, sustained around 50MPH.When inside the tent I couldn't even tell it was windy other than the sound of the wind. There was no condensation build up in the night, and it's a great size.It was also super easy to set up. My last tent took me at least 40 minutes to set up and turned me off camping a bit. This will definitely motivate me to camp more.Great tent!"
4,"Good tent, but more of a two-season tent","My husband got this for a camping trip, and while it was a good tent, it's more of a two-season tent (spring/summer) than a three-season tent...unless you count warmer fall days as a third season."
4,happy camper,I purchased the tent for my son who was excited to use it. Went camping in wind and rain and had no problems with set-up and use. Performance was excellent. He kept warm and dry.
3,"Great, when not broken","I purchased this about 5 months ago and instantly feel in love with it! It withstood frigid winter temps in Michigan, a horrible rainstorm in Tennessee, and some intense heat in Utah. However, on my fourth time using it the bungie broke inside one of the poles. If not for this the tent would get 5 stars instantly. I am going to email their customer support, if it gets fixed for FREE I will give 5 stars."
4,Solid Tent,"I bought this tent for camping in the Badlands over the fourth of July. It was great. Roomy enough for me and all my gear, and I was even able to fit all my cooking gear in the vestibules. It rained, no the sky opened up and it poured on my last day there, but I had taken the advice of the other reviewers and made sure the rainfly was on tight. I stayed nice and dry and didn't even get any condensation inside the tent. I had, however, waterproofed the rainfly a couple days before I went camping.The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is closing the vestibule from inside the tent is awkward, but having known that ahead of time made it not that big of a deal.Also didn't have the same bug attraction problem some people have complained about.All in all a great tent, especially since I got it for $80 including two-day shipping, so if you can find it for ~$70 I'd buy it!"
5,Apex 2xt,"Great tent. Very light and easy to pack. Very, very quick and easy setup. Would recommend for anyone."
3,Not really a full value for the money,"Bad vestibule design. The vestibule is doesn't provide a easy way to enter or exit the tent.The things that get stuck (frost/water) on the vestibule can also get onto your clothes/into tent while entering or leaving the tent.I would have recommended this to any one if the above was the only flaw.But below are some flaws that's really made me not to recommend:On one of the side where the fly doesn't cover fully (i.e. where there is a vent with mesh) water drop get's formed inside the tent caused due to the night's frost. Also there are two sides where the pole get's stuck to the tent is all cloth, if you by mistake hit the cloth while hitting the tent peg - the cloth get's torn. Not really designed for back-country rough use. Tent poles are cheap ones.If you are already shelling out around $80 for this tent I would recommend spend little more and get a different tent (with a fly that covers the tent completely) - not this one, especially for back country camping."
3,wish i got the regular Apex 2,"you would think the apex 2xt would be superior to the regular xt b/c it has more storage space using outside vestibules. But the design seems flawed as the vestibules don't really get taut enough. Tent doors are mesh only, not mesh and full, and vestibule covering is full fabric only not full and mesh. It makes for an awkward design when you're in the tent.Condensation was also a problem so you really need to keep open your ""private"" vestibule covering. I would seriously look into the regular apex 2 before buying this XT version. I wish i had."
3,Too small for two,"I found this tent to be way too small to be considered a two person tent. Sure we both fit into it, but when the rain fly was down and the air mattress was inflated, there was absolutely no additional room, even for our luggage (just one small bag). I think it would be a great one-person tent but would urge you to go up a size if you're considering this for two.On a positive note, we got an absolutely torrential rain pour and the tent stayed completely dry."
5,Eureka Apex 2xt,I bought this for our Boy Scout Troop this is the 6th one I have gotten and we Love them especially for backpacking
4,big or small,hey i am heath i am 6'4 and i am 16 and i love to backpack and it perfect for me and maybe a 6'5 person buti will say that it the best tent i have ever had in my life and cant wait to use it again and if you are big in width this would be a good tent for one person
5,Great little tent,"I used this tent on my last backpacking trip and it work out great, and for the money you spend it can't get any better."
3,Not bad but is it really rain-proof?,"I bought this tent because of the many reviews I read about how rain resistant it is. However as you can see on the picture (Where was I looking)the fly doesn't cover the whole tent. Anyone who have been camping can tell you that this is the spot it's gonna leak from. I haven't test it in rain yet but I am pretty sure about it. That is what the fly is for.It is a bit heavy too. On the other side it's not too big when packed. It could even fit in your backpack. It says it is a two person tent but 3 of us slept in it and we were fine. We camped in a warm night(45f)in Haines, Alaska. I was sleeping with my 40f Lafuma sleeping bag and my clothes on and I was fine."
4,Backpacking Tent,"I would have gone five starts but I have not had the chance to use the tent yet. I am very satisfied with the purchasing experience. I received exactly what I wanted, delivery was fast and the price was right."
5,Eureka Apex 2xt tent,"This is a well made lightweight tent. It rained heavily in the middle of the night, but no water got in. The only issue that I noticed was if the rainfly is wet and you unzip the flaps to get out, water will drip in due to the shape of the tent. Over-all I'm happy with the size and weight of the tent and it seems like it will be durable."
3,heavier than expected,"Don't get me wrong, it's still a descent weight for hikers. However, it is still heavier than my other hiking tents that I own. When it's rolled up, the length is just perfect where it doesn't stick out as much as others. Both the fabric and poles are definitely higher quality than I'm used to, which adds to the weight. If you are a hiker and want something more sturdy, this may work for you. If you are a light packer, I think the benefits of carry less quality outweigh this one. Your choice... I chose to return this item."
5,AWESOME !!!,"Easy to assemble, great sturdy construction and more bang for the buck !! dont sit there and gawk, buy it !!"
4,Like it,"First, I like the design and color. It didn't disappoint me when I got it. The quality of the material also seems to be good.I used it twice. The first time there was a whole night thunder storm. I could sleep peacefully, not worrying leaking. Some other friends had to sleep partially wet.I saw one review suggesting drop cloth to protect the bottom of the tent. It works great for me. Greatly reduced the effort to clean the tent. And the cost is minimum."
5,Two Campouts Down,I have already taken this tent out camping twice both in sever conditions and it has held up to everything. The first trip my dad and I went camping at a Freez-o-ree and it was 13 degrees all night. We both slept comfortably in the large tent with our gear. The second campout we went to Valley Forge and we slept in it with 30mph winds blowing all the other Coleman tents away. The Eureka brand is a very good tent brand and will hold up to most camping conditions.
4,Not a cool weather tent,"I thought this was a great tent, well made, easy to setup, however it was a bit too drafty for October weather in the WV mountains. Without the rain fly, the tent is all mesh except for one wall. I would have prefered to have the option of zipping all of the mesh walls up with solid fabric. I wasn't aware of this when I bought it. Nevertheless, I will be keeping this tent, it is excellent for warmer weather, however I'm going to find something that I can zip up with little or no mesh that will keep the heat in just a bit better for fall and cooler weather camping."
4,"durable? 'beefy', comfortable watch band","The durable aspect requires time and wear to say good or not. This band is 'hefty' and very comfortable since the construction has 'give' and has plenty of vent holes for diving or hot, sweaty days. I had trouble getting my original order, but the vendor wrote back to me and fixed the problem. I ordered a couple more and had no problem. Good service. I would order from them again.GPR"
1,SDS term is misleading,Only the 2 drill bits provided in the kit fit into a SDS plus chuck. The remaining items cannot be used with a SDS plus hammer drill. I have no idea why unrelated items which must be used in seperate drill chucks and are not compatible are packaged and sold in the same kit.
1,Cheap and broken,Just opened my package and could not have been more diapointed. The mirror housing is plastic and would not stand up to a large insect strike in my opinion. The bracket to hold it onto the vehicle was thin and flimsy and poorly machined. The final straw was when I tool it out of the package and turned it over their was no mirror! The whole mirror setup looked terrible and was useless. This is going back and I am going to go hit the junkyad now that I have seen just how nasty this can get.
3,Eh it was alright,"There was a massive hail storm where i lived and took out the orignal mirriors i decided i would get these, well it really doesnt fit right and just didnt look right on whilma, so i took off just the mirrors of the braces and used them."
5,great,"Sometimes older ingredients are better. This cream contains frankincense, and they weren't called the wise men for nothing. This is a great pain reliever. When rubbed in it can relieve my pain so I can get 4 hours sleep. My pain could keep me up all night so this is amazing to me. The only negative for me is that the cream can stain clothing."
1,does nothing.....,quite disappointed with this cream. It does nothing to help any pain. Doesn't even make the area warm or cool.....save your money.
1,Misleading product..,This is capsaicin cream. It has virtually no Boswellia in it. Be advised... boswellia is not an actual ingredient in the product as the name implies.
5,Good stuff. Actually works.,"Nice to find a product that performs ""as advertised"". No side effects, eases muscle and joint pain almost immediately. I've been using it regularly for about a month now for relief from bursitis in my one hip. Works great."
2,"Like the old ""A-bomb"" ointments","I'm not sure what I was expecting -- probably something which really built more on the boswellia herb rather than the menthol ingredient of similar ""A-bomb"" type products."
4,This is the perfect garage calendar,"This is the perfect garage calendar for any man. The models in this calendar are sexy and can operate some heavy equipment. Ms. September has an interresting array of tools on her pegboard. The vivid photography is well laid out and very pleasing to the eye. You'll want to spend more private time in your garage with this calendar. The actual calendar part is kinda small and out of the way, but every day is like Christmas with the 2001 Garage Girls in your garage."
4,Addictive!!!!!,"These are the BEST crackers I've ever tasted. They have crunch, a slightly sweet taste and most importantly: sesame seeds. I adore them. And, have been looking for them for years since my favorite gourmet store stopped carrying 'em. That was a big mistake on their part. I'm just thrilled to have found them on Amazon. For those who are watching their wasteline this is a great lil' snack without the guilt. Try 'em, they're GOOD!!!!!"
1,Nostradamus' Unpublished Prophecies,"I thought that the Publisher's statment that Nostradamus was an Alien from another world (several times) was just ridiculous. All if his conclusions are subject to interpretation, and in my opinion missed the mark several times. I wonder who the other ""reviewers"" really are?!? I bought this book on there recommendation. I'm sorry I wasted my time and money!"
1,Robert is misinformed and disregards clear scriptures.,Robert is misinformed and disregards clear scriptures. This book is a destructive tool that does not validate itself through scripture. The Bible is very clear about what will happen to those who add too or take away from the Word of God. I pray that those curses do not come on this man for his teaching that would stray believers from what the Bible says. This book is a lie! Any person who reads the Bible for themselves can divide this book and understand that it is this guys opinion and religious mentality that has caused him to deny what the Word of God says on the subjects of healing and prosperity.Very concerned!!!In the name of Jesus your brother~donny
5,Hiking Guide to Canyonlands and Arches,"Many people think that the best way to see these two great canyonlands parks is to drive through them. But you will have no sense of these places unless you get out of your car and take a walk. You don't have to be a backpacker to experience these places on foot. Exploring Canyonlands and Arches is a great book for short, medium and long hikes and for finding the hike that is best for you and your physical condition."
2,Lots of hikes missing.,"Couldn't find some of the best hikes in the park, such as COurthouse Wash. Too basic."
4,"Good gloves, a little expensive though","These gloves were exactly what I needed, but a little expensive for what they are. I wish the size information had been more prominent on the page. I got them and they were XS and almost too small for my son. So be careful when ordering."
5,Cute Kid's Gardening Gloves,I got these for my granddaughter. They were well made and with good material. Great gloves for working with grandma in the garden.
5,Gardening Gloves,Bought these for my two year old grandson and he loves them. They make great driving gloves too. They are just like the adult models.
5,Fun and Functional.,"These are really cute, and they seem to be really sturdy gloves. My two year old is very big for his age, and they are a little big on him. I would say these would fit the average 4 years and up."
1,Author with corrupt anti-Christian view points,"I purchased this book with the intent of learning about an aspect of self-improvement, not to learn about this man's religion of being his own god. The book is permeated with false teachings ""Being your own god"" and ""pretending you're not going to die"" (Last time I checked 1/1 people do!)""There is no greater power in this universe than Man/Woman"". All of this is ludicrous and has nothing to do with ""Confidence and Personal Magnetism"".There is one true and living God-Jesus Christ.Christian believers beware!""Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.""-Isaiah 40:28""It is appointed unto man to die and after this the judgment""-Hebrews 9:26-28""Every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord""-Philippians 2:10"
4,Some yummy tea.,Yogi Tea is always a good buy. I really enjoy the aroma of this tea and its taste. The only negative thing with the tea was that the shipping cost was too much.
1,Broke the first day!,"Like the other reviewers, my tee broke the first day my 4-year old used it. Granted, he hit the tee more often than he hit the ball, but shouldn't that be expected? Also, the tee was much more difficult to assemble than it should have been. Total piece of junk."
1,Poor quality parts,"After only four swings by a kindergarten child, the thin bottom flange piece broke right in two, rendering the tee useless. This is the second Franklin tee to break at the flange. The thin plastic pieces are poorly constructed for the amount of force that can impact the tee. Maybe Franklin makes their money on people who buy these replacement parts? (Shipping for replacement parts is more than the tee itself!) Definitely NOT recommended!"
1,agree with the junk sentiment,"first time my son swung at it, he swung low and the tee broke off from the base. going to go to the hardware store and beef it up to a better quality."
3,not bad,"it falls apart almost constantly, but I think it's meant to. not a bad price and it serves it's purpose so i'm happy with it"
1,Like everyone else says -- junk!,"Look at all the awful reviews. Sort of speaks for itself. Junk. This manufacturer should be embarrassed. I bought this for just $9.99 at my local Target, assembled it per the included instructions, and the base broke on my five-year-old boy's second swing. It snapped where it seems like everyone else's did: right where the threads of the tee screw into the base. Unfixable. My son was pretty disappointed and so was I. Thank goodness I kept my receipt. It's going back. Do NOT purchase this POS. ZERO STARS. Boo! Hiss."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this for my young, under 5, kids. It fell apart the first time my 3 year old hit it. I re-assembled it and we tried again, and then the part where the tube screws into the base literally broke. Was a total waste of money and worthless. Should be made to withstand more than a few hits from a 3 year old. Very disappointing. Please do not purchase!"
1,Broke during first 5 minutes,"We got this at Target for $12 yesterday and it broke within the first 5 minutes of use. Shame on Target, Amazon, and the company for selling this."
1,Horrible,I have never written a review but had to in this case...absolute junk. I bought it for $10 and isn't worth anything.... Do NOT buy this.
1,serious piece of junk,"We bought one of these two years ago, managed to get through a summer of use with my 4-year-olds, only having to fix it every OTHER time anyone stepped near it. Last Christmas, I bought another one, figuring that the one we had was defective and this new one would be good to go. No. It was the same exact issue. It's just a shoddily made piece of junk, according to every review here and my own experience. Terrible product."
1,Complete POS,"You get exactly what you pay for with this piece of garbage. My five year old sheared off the cheap, plastic base in less than 10 minutes."
1,Junk,"Broke almost immediately, total junk. Also wouldn't recommend this style of ball-holder top because the rubber spikey-like things on top don't hold the ball well at all, it's very difficult to keep it balanced. This is poorly built, a true case of you get what you pay for."
1,Piece of junk,"Untwists from the bottom too easily, breaks every time he uses it and we have to re-screw it in. Piece of junk!"
1,Poor quality,"After a few hits with my 6 year old daughter, the base broke. I will spend my money on a higher quality tee."
2,Our base broke within a few weeks!,"Bought this when my twins were 5 1/2. The pieces are decent quality i guess, but the base broke off the stand rather quickly, you would think this would be made to withstand being hit? I mean that's what your doing with is having a child swing a bat at it, right?? I ended up taking a glue gun and glued the crap out of it so it wouldn't come apart again, but we eventually just lost interest in it because it's a pain in the butt :( I shouldn't have to rig toys like this."
1,Poorly built,"This tee didn't even stand up to 15 minutes of trying to teach a child to hit. The plastic that the post is made of is weak and of inconsistent thickness. I like the tip material and the base, but it is impossible to give a decent rating to a product that snapped in half during regular use by my niece."
1,Cheap Plastic,"This batting tee is junk.Every other tee I've used has been durable rubber, this one is mostly plastic.The tee kept seperating from the base. It broke after about 25 baseballs hit from it."
1,Made it 2 days...,"Got it for my 7 year to get his swing down. same story as everyone else, broken plastic piece that holds the tee to the plate. Junk."
1,Consensus wins!,It's true. The base piece that holds the tee to the plate is a poor-quality plastic. It literally broke within 30 minutes of opening the box (by a 3 year old). We called for a new piece which was sent free by the company. That one lasted 2 weeks. Shame on Franklin (or whatever parent company owns it) for putting out such a crappy product.
2,Not Engineered for Common Use,"Our daughters loved playing with the display at our neighborhood store, but once we got it home, we quickly realized that in order to use the track in any of the suggested configurations, one would need to screw the green baseplates to a table or board (like they have it at the store).However, there is no indication of this on the box or in the instructions. In fact, the instructions say you can use it on the carpet.The problem is the big, twisted ""overpass"" piece of track. When you bend it to make the giant loop, it naturally pulls the two green baseplates up off the floor! So you cannot run the cars on the track without holding down each baseplate with your hands.That's just plain ol' bad engineering.Darda: Either clearly tell customers they'll need to screw it to a table like a train set, or re-engineer the set to not pull up like this."
3,gets boring fast,My son loved this at the toy store but once at home he played with it for 5 minutes. In the store they had a special table for it but at home it's ont he floor and it is not that stable. It's cute and the car really moves but after doing it for a little while it's not that fun anymore. I would not recommend this - just another toy in the collection they don't play with - ugh.
2,Not much fun for 3 1/2 year old,"We bought both this track and the NASCAR Victory Lane track for two of our grandsons for Christmas 2009. This track was bought for the 3 1/2-year old and is much more difficult to assemble than the other. Grandpa took over the assembly. It kept tipping over so we taped the track down to our floor so that it wouldn't lift. The sole car that came with the set got misplaced within the first few hours of use so we were glad that we had separately bought a second car (as other reviewers had suggested) or Christmas would have been a disaster. Our grandson enjoys playing with the self-propelled cars without the track, perhaps more than on it. I noticed that the track is back in its box at his house."
4,great race track!,"This is a great race track. Easy to put together and my 3 year old (and his older sisters too) have loved playing with this since he received it 2 weeks ago. The best part - no batteries! While his hot wheels and similar cars can't fly around the track like the darda car, they can still be pushed along by hand (which is nice - I was worried his other cars wouldn't fit/roll on the track). I am sure we will be adding to this track and getting more darda cars. Fantastic!"
2,Waste of money,It was fun while it lasted but the car didn't last more than a week and now we're left with a lot of plastic track that can't really be used much with other cars. There are moreDarda Upside Down Overpassimaginative toys out there that are worth the money more than this was.
3,Missing pieces,"We got this as a Christmas gift for our son. It was rather disappointing to open it on December 25 and realize it was missing not one, but two pieces. The missing parts were one of the straightaways and the smaller of the two flex-track pieces. We were unable to assemble the kit without them. I did call Darda customer service today and they are going to ship the pieces out soon.The track looks fun, so I hope it performs well once we have all the parts."
3,Just ok,"I bought this toy for my 5 year old great nephew, both he and his father loved playing with it. Track is a little flimsy and would be much better if it came with two cars."
1,Good book with a catch,The book is great for beginning programmers. It has end of chapter review questions and code exercises. THE CD DOES NOT PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS OR EXERCISES. WHILE THE PRESENTATION IS GOOD I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING ANOTHER BOOK. ONLY INSTRUCTORS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE ANSWERS. THIS OFFERS NO ASSISTANCE TO PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE LEARNING OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM.
5,Great CD!,What a great CD! If you are interested in hearing actual demonstrations and learning more about the allergic response than this CD is for you. There is also a handy guide on the back of the CD giving an overview of the steps to performing the Allergy Process. I really appreciate the fact that this is presented in a way that you actually learn and feel comfortable with doing the process. I definitely recommend this CD.
5,This Book Shouldn't Be So Obscure,"To clarify, this isn't a sequel to Sheila Hervey's Some Canadian Ghosts; it's actually a slightly older book (ESPecially Ghosts) published under a new title. Either way, both books are excellent, written by likable authors, and, if I recall correctly, the two women did know each other, so the new title is forgivable.This is a collection of mostly Canadian ghost stories, written by a British woman, with occasional comments on the generally benign nature of the supernatural, which does date it a bit. The author also wrote the autobiographical Ghosts I Have Known, which is also recommended."
4,pie keeper,This pie keeper is a good size for large pies and cream pies that have a lot of pie topping. It keeps the pie very fresh. You can also store other items in it besides pies.
2,SO DIFFICULT TO OPEN,"When I first got this I was impressed with how substantial it is (this is not THIN plastic)...then I tried to open it. First of all it is all white, with two small opposing ""flaps"" (like the top of a heart shape). No way to know which flap to push UP and which to pull DOWN to separate top from bottom. I had to study it carefully to make sure I wasn't just pushing it together! Then came the hard part...actually OPENING it...it took ALL my strength (plus the ""flaps"" are so small that it's hard to get a grip). Remember those Chinese-torture toys you had as a child? This is pretty comparable. I thought, okay, it'll be easier after the first time...WRONG...it's hard to open every time. If you have something you don't want your kids to get at...this is for you."
4,Just rewrite the last 50 pages in your head...,"This is a lovely story - the romance develops naturally, realistically, and you cheer for the hero and heroine--both very intelligent, intrepid souls--every step of the way. For once British aristocracy is presented as they really are (febrile, inbred do-nothings, but in the best taste) and are presented with sharp wit and unerring detail. It was five-star material until the very end... If you can overlook the weak (and rather contrived, if you please) ending, this is a fine book."
4,"Witty and lovable, one of the best romance I've read lately","I liked, admired and rooted for Constance from the first chapter, she was one of those heroines that I didn't have to warm up to but instantly loved.And the moment she and Joseph meet the sparks fly. Theirs is a delightfulrelationship full of humor, and tenderness and from the moment they meetyou know they belong together. There is absolutely no question that theyweren't made for each other. Most of the time when reading a romance Ican't figure out why the heck the h/h are falling in love with each other.Usually it's just a case of lusting over each others gorgeous bods.Refreshingly, it's not the case in this book!"
2,Its ok!,"My son loves colorful tablets taht he can use at bath time, but these are too small compare to the Crayola ones we usually buy. he end up using 3-4 at a time to have some kind of color and they didn't last for too long. Woudln't buy this kind again!"
1,Didn't color the water,The first two tablets we used worked okay. Water was colored but not too bright. After a few weeks we tried to use a tablet and no color at all. We put in two more tablets and nothing...clear water. Maybe they expire quickly.
2,Not a great brand,"I've gotten color tabs before and the kids love them in the bath. I've done different brands. This particular package contains a lot of small tablets and the color was just okay compared to the color of another brand I used.Also, the packaging said best if used by 1/07. So, maybe the fact that I was sent something that expired over 3 years ago was part of the reason the colors weren't that great. We'll finish this pack up and go back to the other styles."
5,Best Anatomy and Physiology Textbook,I used the third edition of this textbook when I was enrolled in Anatomy and Physiology I and II in college twenty three years ago. It is still used by the college I attended. The present edition (11th edition) which I purchased is the number one Anatomy and Physiology textbook. It explains every anatomical term and concept very well. The artwork is fabulous in showing the Anatomy and different Physiological processes. It is the best Anatomy and Physiology textbook for a two semester Anatomy and Physiology course.
5,Great A&P Text,"I have found this book very helpful, it has a ton of useful information on medical conditions, as well as the general A&P information."
3,"Good, not as good as expected.","Book is obviously used, but good in that it has not been written on. Came within the time specified, and good value. This product description mentioned that it would be with Atlas and Registration card. This was misleading as it was not present."
5,Anatomy Used Book,I purchased a used Anatomy & Phys. book and it saved me alot of money compared to purchasing it from the college. I received my book in a week and it was in good condition.
4,Good Buy,I was very pleased with this purchase. Book was in very good condition and the price was excellent!
2,Not quality...,"These black ballet flats were cute when they first came, but within a week they were scuffed and scratched. Very uncomfortable and illfitting - they slouched at the heel. The ""ribbon"" on the front snapped off when I stepped on it. They didn't even last for a month of wear, and they never had the cute ballet flat shape. Not even worth $20..."
5,I don't know a better Primer on Jewish Thought,In my opinion this is Jonathon Sack's Magnum Opus. In this book he clearly defines what it means to be a Jew and what makes Jews different. An absolute must for anyone who is looking to get into Judaism or would like to tickle their brain with some fundementals in Jewish thought and theology.A Truly Incredible Book.
4,What a holistic approach!,"I was amazed by this book! A great holistic approach, yet so practical! I've never read to many books like this! A friend of mine who's a chiropractor, told me this book should be translated in as many languages as possible, for the benefit of the mankind! Just a warning, if the reader is not well acustomised into the spiritual and psychologogical aspects of the humans, she may find this knowlege kind of impractical! But if you understand that most of the healing power is within you, this is one of the best books on the subject! And if you don't understand this, it will help you with it!"
1,EHH?,I'm not really a self help book kind of personal and this one definitely didn't change my mind.
4,Eliminate Sway,Instructions could have been better. A bit more difficult to install than we planned. Works very well in combination with the Valley weight distributing hitch. I recommend this product if the wind is taking you off course.
5,"Excellent product,","Excellent product, I have been trying for a long time different products, this is the only one that could fix on my ears"
1,All show,These look good. They don't function well. Bud doesn't stay in ear. Soft covers fall off buds to easy. Don't buy these
2,very uncomfortable and not that noticably different sound quality,"First off, these are extremely uncomfortable headphones. The strap around the back are very awkward, but I suppose if you are running then it makes sense. I couldn't stand them.I didn't find the sound quality that much different from the free headphones that come with an iPhone. Save your money, you are paying for the design, and I'd argue even that isn't that good on these.It makes me think if their 20k sound systems are a similar situation."
5,Super crisp sound with just the right amount of bass.,"These headphones are definitely worth the price. The sound is super crisp with just the right amount of bass. Most earbuds either have no bass or are overkill. These are just perfect. Compared to Bose earbuds and Klipsch earbuds, these are atleast 3 steps above. While the Bose and Klipsch may have ""noise cancelling"" attributes which these lack, the audio from these makes up for it. Compared to the Bose, the Bose sound muted and the bass almost cancels out the vocals and instruments. Something which is supriseing because Bose is known for not haveing any bass. The Klipsch image S4 are a bargain but again the crispness just isnt there when compared to the A8's."
1,NOT SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE!!!!!!,I RATE WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTORS REALLY POOR. WHEN I RECEIVED MY ORDER THERE WAS NO EARPHONES INSIDE THE BOX! I SUBMITTED A CLAIM AND THEY DID NOT WANT TO RESOLVE IT AND REFUSE TO RE-SEND THE ITEM OR TO CREDIT BACK MY CREDIT CARD. I HAD A REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THEM AND WOULD NEVER EVER BUY FROM THEM!!!
1,"Great Sound, short lifetime...","Got this earphones as a gift.On the begining was impressed with the high quality of the sound and its bass, however, after 1 week of intensive use left side stop working.Its a shame for a earphone this expensive.The cable seems to be very fragile. For this price they should have untaggled cables."
2,I'll keep it simple for you,"Very simple... They don't fit in your ear canal. They can't compare to earphones that do. I just got these and wanted to like them so bad but just can't. I have a cheap pair of Sony sport headphones that stay in place better and fit in my ear. They don't sound as clean for sure, but the extra bass and loudness makes up for it.Not sure why anyone would want these over Sony or Bose phones that go into the ear canal. When I take these and press them into my ear, they sound a million times better. B & O need to take their technology and create sport phones that fit better.I read a lot of reviews of people that seem to like these bc they rest on the outside? Why? When you are working out, you want that extra loudness, bass, and oompf that only in ear canal headphones provide.The sound on these is clean for sure, but no bass whatsoever. Big turn off for me."
3,sound great until...,"I purchased a pair of these off amazon last summer. They sound amazing, are comfortable, and a their design is intriguing. Unfortunately I had to send in for an exchange a few months in because the right speaker was buzzing with any amount of bass. I immediately was sent a replacement, and have been enjoying them daily. However, just a few days ago, the same thing started to happen! There is a slight amount of buzzing in the right speaker, and it progressively gets worse.As a note, I use these earphones between 4-6 hours daily during the week at work, so they definitely get a lot of use. Also, I tend to listen to music fairly loudly. That said, when I pay $180 for a pair of earphones, i expect them to last. I'm going to have to send in for another replacement."
1,Fake from Amazon,I've purchases many of these headphones from Bang & Olufsen official website for years. I then tried from amazon and diffidently saw a big difference. Sound Quality and overall durability. ebay and amazon sell the fake stuff. Do your research.[...]
3,J. A. Henckels Knives are Staples in the Kitchen,I love J. A. Henckels knives. There are different quality steels that are used in their construction. I find that the German steels are the best and I am happily stocking my kitchen block with them.
5,FAVORITE knife,"I've used it for years, have many others, and it is still my favorite. I usually reach for this one for whatever I am doing unless it is some very small job. It sharpens well, over and over. I live abroad and have a maid and she also uses this knife almost exclusively. I finally broke a bit off the end of the handle (probably pounding jars open, some dumb thing) and am going to order a new one, even though I don't really need it."
5,Souper-Douper!,"A hefty, comprehensive, door-stop of a book, this ""soup-lopedia"" includes every soup I'd ever had a hankering to make--""Sopa de Ajo""--Spanish-style garlic soup with an egg in it (I craved it after a trip to Madrid) and Dried Fruit Soup (which my Scandinavian grandmother made when I was growing up)--and every other broth-based dish under the sun.The histories of the soups and ingredients are so thorough and so fascinating that I felt like I was in a cooking class being taught by a wise, likeable teacher--and the photos of the soups were mouth-watering, and gave me serving suggestions.An A++ book--I'm giving it to several people for Christmas!"
1,Splendid but not useful,"There's nothing like hot, hearty soup on a cold winter day. If you want to read about soups, great book. If you want to cook them, forget it. The book suffers from overly complicated recipes. To make matters worse, it's filled with errors and omissions. Recipes sometimes seem to skip steps (ingredients never get added!), and the ingredients chapter doesn't bother to describe the truly unusual ingredients. It's as if the editor just checked spelling and no one actually tried to COOK from the recipes."
2,Fine guide but missrepresents park,"A fine guide to walking in Forest Park, but misrepresents the experience. The Park has little in common with a wilderness: Virtually all of it was logged or burned in the past 100 years so there is virtually no old-growth or mature forest; over half is overgrown with ivy and other invasive species; and much of it is in earshot of industrial activity. It is still a very nice place to walk and bike, but the breathless rapture in this book could give you the wrong impression."
4,Cute but has it's descrepancies...,"This book is excellent and cute and good for anyone who is an avid collector of fairy things. However it has recipes in it and one of them contains items known to be poisonous or at least not meant for human consumption I think that for a children's book it would be safer if it's recipes were less threatening as children do not always read a book thoroughly. Some of the mythology and folklore in the book is good and the illustrations are wonderful. It is truly a collectors item and if you like me find yourself looking for an interesting coffee table book, this is a good one to add to the collection."
5,spicey goodness,This chai is more flavorful than the Stash black tea chai I had ordered before. Also has the bonus of being organic. Can recommend the Good Earth brand basically across the board. Almost all of their teas exceed expectations.
5,So Good!,"This tea is so good tasting. I was buying it for a while at my local markets, but they apparently have discontinued carrying it. Then the light bulb in my head went off and I checked Amazon. Lo and behold, there it was! Now everyone in my house is hooked and I'll be ordering more soon. Seems the consensus is a bit of honey and milk, and this tea is just so satisfying. Great blend of spices; I think this is the best Chai Tea on the market."
5,Delicious,"I had tried this a while back and though it was pretty good. Only problem is, it's been difficult to find locally for some reason. Glad to see it on Amazon and in bulk too. You really can't go wrong with GoodEarth teas if you are looking for a bagged tea. Every bag so far has been fresh and consistent."
5,My go to tea,"I have this on auto-subscribe if that tells you how much I like it. This is my favorite Thai from a tea bag. My husband had been buying Stash Vanilla Chai - which he loved , but wasn't quite my cup of tea (pun intended). After trying my Good Earth Chai, he has now told me we only need to buy the Good Earth as it is his new favorite."
5,"Luv, Luv, Luuuuuuv this tea!","Okay, you know this tea has to be good to look at buying it online! So, if you like the flavors of chai & vanilla, then this is a no-brainer... your only surprise will be the smooth robust taste... equally good by itself or with milk and honey. If you're new to chai teas and are looking for a calm, delicious (I can't believe it's tea!) experience than again... this is the winner! Bonus story: over the holidays I wound up with a terrible head cold, this is the only food (if you can call it that?) that I LOOKED FORWARD to ingesting. Even with infirmed taste buds I could still taste these comforting flavors and knew I was at least able to ""treat"" myself to something enjoyable to keep hydrated. So, TRY IT... YOU'LL LOVE IT TOO! P.s It's decaf-good-for-you-too! Enjoy!"
5,"A brilliant, heartbreaking collection","The selections in this anthology are some of the most wrenching, beautiful, and eloquent passages I have ever read. Each of the women writers in these pages has suffered through some sort of mental illness, whether it is her own or that of a loved one. What I found most interesting is that even though these women come from vastly different backgrounds and time periods, their struggles have much in common. For example, a woman in the 1990s writes about some of the same moods, symptoms and prejudices and that a 15th century author describes. The letters by Zelda Fitzgerald are fascinating, and the final essay by Martha Hughes is worth the price of the book alone. This is a classic collection."
3,Slim volume on a vast topic,"The Modern Library carries a certain weight of moral authority, especially for readers who grew up with its respectable tomes lining the family bookshelves. It was the canon, really, for middle class America. So I expected more than twenty-odd quick (though arresting) briefs filed from the various historic madhouses - that comprise this collection. Why so meager? The listing claims 229 pages. My edition has 175 plus an eight-page Introduction. In addition, quite a few of the selections have likely already been read by many, since they have been culled from American best-sellers of the past several decades. As dark and important a subject as women and madness deserves more than this quick once-over."
3,I beg to differ?,"In contrast to some of his other works I felt that Hocus Pocus didn't provide a good structure. It took me a good 100 pages to actually get into this book; the early part of the novel to me entailed a lot of ""brain gibberish"" that I didn't know what to do with until later on in the story.Yet with time, characters start to come into place and develop further for the rest of the novel. And as always, Vonnegut's creativity and wit takes it toll and makes the read more worthwhile."
2,I found myself wanting to,"chuckle, wanting to laugh as I did during my college days at Auburn reading Vonnegut's classics. I think Hocus Pocus has lost the magic; I found it insipid not inspiring as his previous works. The soaking sarcasm and bitter cynicism were 2 overdone and I for 1 found the book predictable and mundane.There were ""moments"" within the character development passages that were reminiscent of the more rewarding reading of Vonnegut in days gone by, but they left me hopelessly hanging to a bitter end.You may laugh because ""everyone"" says that you should, after all of the great reviews which were wall papered on the book cover. And this should serve as a warning to those paying attention not to pay any money for this paperback, unless you have a table that is missing four inches from one of it's legs."
1,One big yawn of a novel,"HP is a slow sigh (""cough""), a wheezing deflation, a tedious grind. Vonnegut is a fine writer, to be sure, but his talents are poorly deployed here. I listened to this relentlessly overcast novel on the morning commute of similarly overcast days. I learned not a thing, was entertained not a whit, and was moved nary an ounce. HP is dull, dull, dull -- the dimmest of stars in an otherwise bright Vonnegut sky."
3,"Cliches, forced humor..","While I am a great fan of Mr. Vonnegut in general, this book seems really bad. He based his entire story on cliches from the 60-s using a style which should be witty but which almost never works on me. When reading his earlier books, I found his wit facinating. But here, he seems to have lost his edge. I guess he is just talking about so much pointless stuff, it is hard to keep reading the book. I cried my way through Slaughter H. 5 and I laughed my way through Cat's Cradle. Those are masterpieces. But, in this case it all seems _so_ boring.... Or maybe I was just expecting to much from Mr Vonnegut because of his excellent earlier books."
3,"Brave stab, but doesn't stand up to other works.","The best part of Hocus Pocus is the beginning; It creates such a lure that the reader creates immense hope for the rest of the novel and for the most part, the novel does a good job of lving up to those hopes. Vonnegut's style is once again back in full flair, but I found myself bored by some chapters, whereas in another work, Slaughterhouse-5, every page kept me entertained. Not to say this is a bad book, but there are better Vonneguts out there."
3,RosettaBooks Kindle edition,"The RosettaBooks Kindle edition of Hocus Pocus is well formatted and has an active TOC. I found only one typo.As for the book itself, Hocus Pocus is not Vonnegut's finest but it is still a worthy book and its central themes are very relevant to contemporary America, especially after the Sandy Hook Primary School massacre.So, 3 stars for the novel and 5 stars for the kindle edition by RosettaBooks."
2,Cynical diatribe without the good humor of earlier works,"I was a student of the University of Iowa when Vonnegut was in residence at the Writer's Workshop. Kurt would be working on drafts of Slaughter House Five in the English Philosphy Building where I was taking Rhetoric . I lionized Kurt because of his anti war stance and seminal earlier works. In the mids 1970 beginning with ""Slapstick"" he seemed to have lost his way as a writer. With the exception of ""Bluebeard"" his novels becamemore and more difficult to read. ""Hocus Pocus"" is an angry book not leavened with the humor and sense of wonder that made his earlier works so delightful.Read ""Mother Night"" and ""Slaughter House Five "" to start your tour of Kurt."" Hocus Pocus"" is a difficult, unrewarding read."
3,"Good, but not great.","This is an entertaining book, but it is not an example of why Vonnegut is cannonized in modern american literature. Though it is well written,and the plot rather ubelieveable plot but still imaginable, I was never too excited about the book. Vonnegut seemed to be trying to hard to be innovative/alternative in the style of this book, the narrative is delivered over hundreads of scraps of paper. This forced deviance is more obstructive than anything, and the few actually refreshing techniques are hobbled by trite phrases. Anybody who's seen a Vietnam movie will seeminly recognize a good deal of lines in this book. This is still Vonnegut, though, and were it another author I would not have been so harsh. However, there are certainly more aclaimed Vonnegut books out there, and for good reason. Choose them over this one."
5,Funny Skulduggery,"I gave this book 5 stars because, apart from being funny and entertainingly satirical, it was written in a circular manner that was something different -- maybe this is Vonnegut's style (this is the only book I've read of his), but the structure of the tale itself could be the ""hocus pocus"", i.e. a second layer of meaning (e.g. about history tending to repeat itself). I think this is a book that could be studied at length without losing its quirky character or fun."
5,"Can you say ""NUTTY"" ?","I am a rabid Vonnegut fan, and this is one of my favorites. All the biting sarcastic humor you have come to expect from Vonnegut is in this book, along with all his commentary on this messed planet we inhabit. Honestly this book has everything, a prison break, a war, mental patients, and of course, like all Vonnegut, a story by the one and only Kilgore Trout."
4,Vonnegut near his pointless best,"What bleak existentialism lies at the heart of Vonnegut's work! Ho hum. Having finished this book, I feel as though I have awoken, loosed from my dream of life, to find a reality far more terrifying than the everyday fears I convinced myself were real."
5,SATIRE AT ITS BEST,"Debs Hartke is a Vietnam Veteran, turned College Professor, turned Prison Warden, turned convict in this hillarious sattirical tale by Vonnegut. Although this novel doesnt get the attention of a BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS or SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, it is just as worth the read.Vonnegut uses the character of Hartke to chastise big government, big money, big media, and big egoes everywhere. Even if you dont agree with his assessment you cant help but laughing anyway.Things just keep getting worse for Hartke as life goes along, he wanted to be a journalist who graduated from Michigan. Instead his father forces him to go to Westpoint and things snowball from there. He goes through Vietnam, he marries a woman that goes insane in her forties,..........and every moment is brilliantly written.I recommend the book, I recommend the author. This will not be the last Vonnegut novel that I pick up."
3,There Have Been Better,"I have read many of Vonnegut's books, and this one has the same structure as all the others, but it just didn't excite me like many of his other books have done. It is worth checking out, but know that Vonnegut has written better material."
3,How hope and faith can overwhelm evidence,"Good but a tad overlong. Great look, though, at how hope and faith can overwhelm evidence and caution and how a bandwagon mentality can redirect resources away from valuable endeavors to fund a snipe hunt. Hmm...that could be a parable for the war in Iraq."
4,By far the softest bedding set at Babies R Us,"This was absolutely the softest bedding set, hands down. The only complaint I would have is that it is currently sold only as a 6 piece set. I did not particularly need a diaper bag, nor do I have a window that can use the valance, so I would have preferred if I could have bought the pieces that I liked (the bumper, the sheet, the duvet, the dust ruffle) on their own, or substituted them with the mobile which is gorgeous."
3,not sooo pleased,"When I was at the store I fell in love with this set. I loved the different textures that made it so soft. I have had the set for 6 months now and I noticed as well that the chenille is unravelling on the bumpers which is not good. So I have since flipped them over onto the otherside exposing my son in his crib to the smoother side that has a decorative strips on it for now and once my son can pull up on the bumpers to get to the other side I will remove them from his crib. It is so sad that for the money I spent that I would have to take away the fun side to touch from him. Otherwise, I love the crib sheet as it has such cute animals on it for my son to enjoy."
4,Great gift to receive,"We received this set as a present. At the time our friend bought it we didn't know the sex so something neutral was needed, this set is perfect for boy or girl."
1,DANGEROUS!!!!,"As soon as I saw this bedding set I knew I had to have it for my new baby boy. It was so cute! I got it at my shower and my son was born this past April! The room looks beautiful, HOWEVER, the chenille portion of the bumper started to unravel and the set is only 7 months old. When I went in to pick up my son from his crib after his nap, I noticed that there were fibers and strings in his crib! It completey unraveled leaving a large hole and loose strings in his crib. He could have choked to death! I was horrified. This set is NOT SAFE and should be recalled. I have a letter going to the manufacturer with a request for a recall. If you have this set, please replace the bumper and comforter with a safe one. If you are thinking about getting this set, please take this into consideration and buy something else!"
5,LOVE IT,It is so beautiful and so soothing. My daughter love it and she's not overwhelmed with bright colors or harsh materials. The chennille and satin piece rub her the right way.
5,Anxious Grandma from Liberty,"Wow - after reading some of the reviews, I'm sure glad I can sew. My daughter is expecting their first, and since the proud-parents-to-be don't want to know the sex until birth, the Arcadia set was perfect for boy or girl. Since you can only purchase it in a set, there are 2 items they couldn't use - the valance and bed skirt. So - I took the bed skirt and made a long valance for their double-wide window. Then I took the valance, cut it in half, put one on top of the other, purchased ...matching fabric to add to the sides, put 4 tabs on top for the rod, puffed it, and hung it on the wall. Absolutely gorgeous. With the left over fabric, I am going to make some pillows for the window seat. I realize not everyone has a seamtress or a sewing capability, but for those of you that do, just wanted to share my ideas. I can't wait to purchase the mobile and then the room will be complete and ready for our precious arrival."
4,Wonderful set - Hard to find accessories,Colors are great in this set and can be used for a girl or a boy. Finding the accessories on the other hand has proven to be a core. I like Nora from DI have been looking for the wall hangings and got the same 90 day story she did.
2,covers are not that great,I had to return these covers because they do not stay on my leather seats. I was getting a wear spot on my seats from getting in and out of my car. Each time i got in or out of my car i would have to reset the cover. No good unless you have material other than leather to cover.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I was a little skeptical about the benefits of a carving knife, but wow, this knife is amazing (good weight, good quality). It cut through the turducken like butter. The carving fork was perfect for keeping the stuffing in place while cutting through the birds. I've only used it once, but will definitely find add'l opportunities to use this set."
5,Excellent even two years later!,"I bought these knives for my husband in 2010. He absolutely loves these. They are very sharp and make the job of carving a turkey much easier; slices it like butter. Be careful though, our family member was slicing the turkey with these and didn't realize how sharp they were and went through the tin!! My husband wishes we had these 20 years ago!! Well worth the $$."
4,A journey into life and death and everything in between.,"I am the author of this book. With pain and tears I wrote every word in here. After college, returning home to a dying mother, but aspirations for a career were put on hold. Everything I had left, everything that I had not thought about: family, love, culture, religion and the ties of the past, came to the forefront. I had no choice but to face my history dying before me. I questioned everything, all the while holding to my grandmother's hand. I decided to write. Her past, stories I had heard of her, incidents that occurred in the past both funny and dramatic. I decided I had to keep her alive, even if by words only for soon my memory too would die. I wanted to leave behind a piece of work that would keep us all alive. And this is it."
2,Found it not needed.,"In my opinion, this map was more of an extra pound of unwanted paper to drag around Ireland. We found that the map we got when we rented a car in Dublin to be sufficient and never got us lost. Maybe we were lucky."
5,product quality,"I am extremely pleased with the Michelin Tourist and Motoring Atlas.It was advertised as being used, However the quality of the Atlas far exceededmy expections. As far as I am concerned it is a product that appears to bebrand new and had excellent care by the previous owner.I could not be more pleased.Congrats to the seller.Adam"
1,Don 't buy,"Do not buy this book. We thought the Michelin map books were suppose to be some of the best! This one had England and Ireland and we are visiting Ireland in a few months. It had it broken down into sections which would have been fine if they had been in order. However, the particular map of West Ireland might be on page 80and 81 and then on page 82 it skips over to England. Very confusing."
3,Last in the Stark series,The story and plot has gotten old. This is the last in the series and rightfully so. I probably wouldn't want to read anymore.
2,"Amazing table, bad assembly","Ridiculously, sadly, horribly long assembly. It took me and two other people at least 4 1/2 hours to assemble the table. Most of it was in german, and it was hardly detailed. Don't even think about buying this product unless you have at least 6 hours for yourself, or 5 hours for three people to set this bitch up. However, it is an fantastic table. It is very easy to use once set up and is just an amazing quality table. Just a warning though, it pissed me off sooo much while assembling this thing, especially because I was so fired up to play some ping pong."
3,Good for beginners NOT FOR KIDS!,"Bought this for my daughter because the reviews said good for beginners... JEEZ! Not for kids though! I wish there were astronomy books for beginner KIDS!This book uses terms maybe not so easy for younger people. A bit dry, even for me.It's on the bookshelf and hasn't come off."
4,Fun Play-Doh Toy,"I bought this toy for my 3-year-old daughter who is obsessed with cutting hair. I am happy with the purchase. The inside chamber is easy for my daughter to fill, and she can easily switch the scalp attachments by herself. She occasionally needs my help to attach the person to the base. Right now she is too young to use the press molds for hairbows, mustaches, etc., but as she gets older I think she will enjoy them. My only complaint is that the pink lever/stand does not click firmly into the larger yellow base that holds the accessories. They frequently come apart. A minor problem but annoying nonetheless."
4,fun and inexpensive,"My three and seven year old daughters have been playing with this toy for over an hour now. The three hair pieces that came with our set slide right onto the head with ease (we do not have the problem that the last reviewer had). I do, however, have to help set the little figure back on the base after the play doh is filled in; if it is not set in properly the play doh will not come out correctly. I am happy with this purchase, especially since the set currently comes with a free set of multi-colored play doh."
4,Toy for Grandchild,I bought this toy for my 2 year old grandson. It is a christmas gift but I am sure he will love it. He loves play doh toys and has several.I would recommend it for any young child who likes to be creative.Marla Ervin-Hardesty
5,If you hunt chukars or even uplands this book is for you...,"I've hunted chukars with a fever since I was able to carry a shotgun 25 years ago. Buddy Levy writes wonderfully and his passion, respect and understanding for this great game bird and the land they inhabit shines. It is obvious this book is personal and we are fortunate Levy has let us in.I highly recommend you make the effort to share Levy's love of what it means to hunt chukars...."
3,Only for small childs,"If you pretend to use this product for an older child or adult...itsn't for U. The plastic pole attach at the base lossen with any movement, I use 2 screws to fix it firmly. Other problem is try to put the ball and avoid it not fall before you hit it, the rubber support makes an angle at a few fail swings and mades the product hard to use... The rubber band also fails to hang the ball if it hits hard."
1,Another Unhappy Customer,"Add me to the list of disappointed parents. We got this as a gift, broke it out and then just broke it. My son - 5 - is in T-ball for the first time and after his official Saturday morning practice, wanted to go home and hit the ball! We put this together, he swung a couple of times and on his second swing, broke the tee at the base.Did Franklin at no point realize that an item used to hold a ball for a metal bat might need to be made from a strong or flexible enough material to withstand normal use? Or did they just pump these out as cheaply as possible KNOWING that this would happen and expecting to make a killing on replacement parts?At least I know NOT to buy Franklin sporting goods. If the batting tee is this poor, I can only guess what their other products are like."
1,Broken by 4yo within 15 mins,"Do not buy! Like others, the base snapped off within 15 mins of use. Luckily, I still have my receipt. Will be returning."
1,Broken!,"My husband and I bought this in preperation for my son to start Tee ball, and to help my daughter with her batting in softball. Within 30 minutes after setting it up, my 4 year old hit the tee instead of the ball and it snapped at the base. No way to repair it. Absolute waste of money."
1,Do Not Buy!,"Purchased for my 5-year old son in preparation for his first year of Tee Ball. Got it home and found that the box did not include the piece that attaches the Tee to the home plate base. Exchanged it and set up the new one. My son took four swings at the ball and on the fifth, the piece that attaches to the base broke in half. Useless. Thank God I kept my receipt. Do not buy this. It is a complete waste of money."
3,"OK intro to JSP, but not for serious developers","As noted in other reviews, this book provides a well-written, quick-read introduction to JSP, covering most of the basics. It doesn't go very deep on any topic. If you're just starting to explore JSP technology, this is a useful read. If you're a serious JSP developer (or about to be one!), this book isn't for you."
4,Good for beginner to Advanced,"Good book with lots of good information. I thought it covered the basics extremely well. Although, I think it is somewhat scattered for any kind of reference manual. The book gives you a good understanding of what JSP is about."
2,Tough for beginners,"Being relatively new to Java and JSP, I needed something that would give me the basic building blocks to get me up and running with JSP. I was hoping for something that would have led me through a series of inter-related jsp pages that implemented the concepts the book was trying to cover. Instead the examples are sporadic, there isn't a great flow to the book and it's gets hard to follow in places.Overall, not a very good choice for beginners."
5,An incredible asset to anyone thinking about using JSP's,"I am not going to say much because it is already said... There is definately a reason that this book was #30 on the amazon seller list for a little. It is easy to understand and very informative for people looking to develop with java server pages. It will help if you have some java experience just because you need it in order to fully take advantage of all of java's built in abilities. I switched over from working with embedded perl, and this stuff is just great..."
2,I don't see what all the fuss is about?,"I was very disappointed in this book after reading all of the stellar reviews it received.First of all if you want to hit the ground running using JSP this is not the book for you. The explanations are too ""wordy"". Please, just the facts, what's explained in two paragraphs in this book could be easily condensed into 2 lines. There are not enough examples and the ones that do exist are not ""real world"". Also, and most important, this book was boring!If you are a professional developer like myself, and you want to start coding without reading through pages and pages of lengthly explanations and geek theory, skip this and go with ""Pure JSP Java Server Pages"" by James Goodwill ISB#: 0-672-31902-0 or ""JavaServer Pages Application Development"" by Ben Forta ISB#: 0-672-319239-x. Plenty of examples and to the point explanations make these two very good books."
4,Good for beginner in jsp,"This book is good for beginner but not for experienced java developer. It is too verbose to get straight answers. Experienced java developer may just need JSP documentation (Specification, JSP Tutorial, JSP Syntax Card) from java.sun.com."
3,thin paper and too many words,"With so many highly rated reviews, I'm just amazed.This book is wordy to the point of being boring. And when I do find a nugget of information, my highliter bleeds through the paper.I buy most of my books through Amazon.com, and then only those books that have significant favorable reviews. Unfortunately I didn't see the review titled ""I don't see what all the fuss is about?, December 7, 2000"". Had I, I might have purchased some other equally well rated book."
2,Not very good for beginners,"This book is very verbose, and yet does not explain detailed information about sample codes. Understanding servelet is important before reading this book."
2,"vague for beginners, worthless for professionals","This book doesn't depict every aspect of JSP technology in a clear and concise manner and is poorly organized. The authors always show some parts of the complex concepts but leave others unexplained. For example, they use 70 pages to introduce, admittedly, the usage of JavaBean in JSP and confuse readers a lot with the nitty-gritty of JavaBean itself. Worse, many code sniplets are weak examples and demand readers¬° imagination and experience.Yes, the book does cover advanced topics. In fact, bewilderedly, advanced topics are illustrated better than basic concepts. But for busy coders, why bother reading a lot (800 pages) but learning few? Many alternatives are out there in the same field. Frankly, I don¬°t recommend it."
5,"Well organized with simple examples, good explainations.","Very well balanced- Does not overwhelm one with the internal workings of web servers but gives you just enough background to understand the fundamentals while leading you into more advanced topics.I've been a professional programmer for 16 years, using many languages and so far Java is my favorite one. This book concentrated on the very things I needed to do: connect to a database, etc. I recommend it."
4,Web Development With Javaserver Pages,"Dynamic content-personalized, customized, and up-to-the-minute-is a key component of site development on the World Wide Web today. Java Server Pages (JSP) is a new server-side technology for generating dynamic content in Web pages and other on-line applications. This guide to JSP covers all aspects of development and includes comparisons to similar dynamic content systems such as CGI, Active Server Pages, Cold Fusion, and PHP. Included is a discussion of the use of component centric design via Java Beans and custom tag libraries for separating the presentation of dynamic data (the layout, look, and feel) from its implementation (the code that generates it)."
5,Excellent coverage!,"This book is excellent for anyone who needs to get started writing JSPs. The coverage is comprehensive, concise, and clear. Each topic is thoroughly explained. Both experienced and newcomers can benefit from this book."
4,Web Development with Java Server Pages,"I find the book to be very well written and has a flow which makes it very simple and easy for the reader to follow the concepts of JSP. It also gives some comparison between similar technologies in the market which is helpful in deciding to some extent the pros and cons of using JSP. Since this book is concentrating on JSP only, it is better to have an idea of Java language and how java servlets work before reading it. The tips in the book are very handy while using JSP. I would like to recommend this book to everyone who is interested in learning JSP.Reena Gupta , Nashville TN - Vice President, Middle Tennessee Java Users Group"
5,A Good Book For JSP.,"A real good book. As mentioned by others, this book is a bit verbose ( i guess the authors wanted to target both java developers and web designers ). In general a very good book. One thing i really like is the appendix section where the authors describe steps to install and run tomcat, things like these really help you in getting upto speed. Section about how to design web apps using Java Beans is also good."
3,Bar B Que Fun,"My husband uses this product, but he does not like it as well as he thought he would. It is hard to protect the peppers from burning on the grill. It works better in the oven."
4,very good knife,"I upgraded to this knife from a chef's knife included in a $25 knife set, and I've been very happy with it. It's very sharp, and nicely balanced / weighted. When I opened it, it was so sharp that it sliced my dish-sponge to ribbons as I was washing it for the first time. Definately a good sign in my book. I don't do a ton of heavy chopping, but for moderate, ordinary kitchen tasks - chopping potatoes, onions, garlic, tomatoes, the accassional carrot, celery, raw or cooked meat - it gets the job done easily. In my opinon, if you don't have a ton of money to spend on a knife, this is a great all purpose tool. I reach for it anytime I need to cut anything. Not the absolute best out there, but for the budding gourmet on a budget, I highly recommend it."
1,Knife Broke,"After owning this for 18 months, this knife broke in two pieces about one inch past the handle. It was the blade that actually broke. What a shock when all I was doing was separating a preseparted cheesecake that was frozen and had paper between the pieces. Scary and True..."
5,A Wine Lover's Must Have,"This book is the best (and most Beautiful) Wine Guide I have ever held in my hands. Fascinating reading, gorgeous pictures and very useful information. This is the only book on the Santa Cruz Mountains wineries that tells you in great detail about 50 of its local wineries. If you like history (and amazing photography) you'll love it for THAT value as well. I never realized the history of winemaking in Santa Cruz went back to the 1800s. I am proud to display it on my coffee table."
2,Poorly written! Incomplete! Some good useful examples! Unfortunately nothing better up there!,"A poorly written book!It appears as if the author chose his chapter headings and section titles well to make it look at first glance like an in depth material covering a broad range of subjects. However, if you read the book you will notice that each section starts with a poor superficial introduction of the subject matter with absolutely no in depth material, followed by a very good example. I must say that most of his examples work, but you will have to scratch your head to know why. He doesn't even comment on his own code other than in a superficial way.I tried to search for a good book on the subject and couldn't after a year of using this one. Being this the only valid source up there, you probably won't have a choice but to get it. It'll get you started, but you will end up having to purchase another book to complete your knowledge."
1,No source code!,"This book does not come with any kind of source code/projects to see the material in action, this ruins it for me.Don't tell that I'm lazy or stupid - I just don't want to create project after project and type all the code just to see if it even works - this is ridiculous!"
3,not that impressed,"When I first ordered this toy I was so excited to have found a cute, wooden puzzle that was also a cool bus. Yeah! But when we received it and opened it up it wasn't as great as I thought. The animals themselves aren't so cute and don't have much detail so it's kind of hard to tell what they are. And with the puzzle being vertical on two sides it's kind of tricky to put the pieces in properly; they often slip in before you actually have the shape lined up so you don't get the satisfaction of having fit the piece in the puzzle. In fact, almost any of the animals can fit into any space because they slip through so easily.It's not horrible. My kids still play with it sometimes. But for the price I expected something nicer with a better design."
2,Disappointing Toy,"I bought the toy for my 18 months old daughter based on the picture on this website. The picture is quite deceptive. The cut-outs for the wood animals are too big and the pieces don't stick in their places. In addition, some of the animal shapes are not representative of that animal. For example, the snake is a round disk. The animals are colorful and hold a child's interest for a while, but overall disappointing."
4,Great adventure with a message,"I bought this book for my 8 year old son to read. I wanted a book with a positive Christian message. He ended up loving this book. He loved the adventure and intrigue. When we were done, he wanted to read it all over again. The only difficulty we have is that it is printed in a cursive style font. This make it hard for him to read at times. It is better to be used where the parent reads to the child. Otherwise the story was wonderful."
5,Great Christian adventure book,"I purchased this book for my 3 year old nephew. I read through it and it seems a bit old for him. The recommended age is 8 so I wasn't surprised. However I do think he will enjoy the story and his mom can explain things to him as she reads it to him. I have the ""Princess and the Kiss"" for my 4 year old daughter and she enjoys it very much."
5,Great story,Wonderful book about doing the right thing. Kids love the story and the pictures are beautiful and interesting.
3,Accumold Elite Flashlight Holder 7909,Matches accumold elite accessories however the strap is very thin for a flashlight holder. The plastic ring wiggles a lot and does not seem sturdy. It works but i feel better when using a flashlight holder made out of leather
4,Very nice knives.,"The bogus MSRP price in this listing aside, the $99 is the typical street price for this set and it's not cheap but so worth it. Very good quality in blade and handle. The knives make eating steak a special event ... well, almost. But it's a serious step up from the Eversharp knives, where the serration is great but rips the meat rather than cut (as the smooth edged Pro-S). Would buy again, even if the price is a bit high."
5,Got 8. Need 8 more.,Splurged three years ago and got 2 sets. Love em. They are still sharp and can draw a thin slice off the end of a New York Strip with ease. Guests love them too. That's why I need 8 more. Our backyard grilling events are getting more popular and I really hate to give some guests the second string knives. I am sitting here pondering the expense. Some things are worth the extra money though and this is probably one of them!
3,Don't listen to this opera in parts,"I bought these highlights used only to hear how these famous singers sound in this famous and revered performance. They sound generally very good indeed but listening to this opera in parts like here is not that enjoyable. This work is very much a whole rather than a sum of the parts. The highlights don't work. Therefore, only three stars."
3,Review of Public Sector Economics by J. Stiglitz,"Excessive use of graphs and charts which are very difficult to follow. Some chapters read easily, others very difficult to understand. Would be better if it had a complementary teacher's guide. LRM"
2,mixed feelings,"accessible text for beginners, but the text is NO preparation for the end-of-chapter questions. With no available answer key and no help from a teacher, the questions are IMPOSSIBLE to answer leaving the student/reader/taker of test extremely tired and hungry and unsatisfied with econ knowledge at 2 in the morning."
3,Mani Neumeier - 'Privat' import CD (ATM),"Pretty much aimed at drum and percussion enthusiasts, although might appeal to fans of experimental. Eighteen tracks penned by the Guru Guru drummer / founder himself showcasing just as to what the mufti-talented sticksman is capable of. Each song sounds completely different from the others with the most outstanding cuts being ""Schall & Rauch"", ""So Nice"",""Bacon"", ""Into Gagaku"" and the tribal ""Flieg,Mein Herz"". 'Privat' SURE held my attention as I noticed how ""Auf Alle Felle"" displays some powerful drumming and some good voice sampling is featured on ""Touch Your Skin"". Comes in a very colorful digipack with a six page fold out telling you about Mr. Neumeier's story. Also available on the Spalax label."
4,Behold! The Storyteller's Bible!,"The Werewolf Storyteller's Handbook is a must-have for any WW:TA Chronicle. It will revolutionize the game and flesh out complete stories to drive the pack. The expansion of fetish rules was a nice touch. The only flaw (and its a 1 pt. flaw) in the book was the bogging down of text at times, making some of it difficult to chew on all at once. The lack of systems will throw off many people, until they come to the realization that it is all about the concepts of the game, and not dice-rolling or gift-slinging. All in all, a complete guide for the member of the gaming group stuck with all the work. :)"
2,Brace yourself for confusion,"Although the premise of the book is very attractive, I found the author's presentation to be absolutely horrible. I have already spent around 8 hours reading and rereading the first few chapters trying to figure out exactly how the notation works. What is missing is a flow chart or state machine describing the exact logic behind the iterative nodes, but instead you get a rambling, scattered, informal description of their operation. The author repeatedly admits to the informality of the description, but since the result is still unintelligible, I find it hard to forgive. It seems as though the author's great excitement for the subject matter caused him to rush through the basics to get to the conclusions. Because I'm still hooked on the premise, however, I'll keep checking the website to see if a lucid specification of the GOO notation ever arrives."
5,"As always, great knives...",Henckels is known for its great knives and these are no exceptions. Nice balance and extremely sharp. And they wear well. They make cooking a much more enjoyable experience. This set is a great start for a complete collection of Henckels knives.
4,Brithish Columbia Smoked Salmon,I sent it as a present and was told by the receiver that it was delicious. That's all I know. I wondered why it wasn't smoked.
2,Smoked salmon but not as we know it!,This smoked salmon was a present but I was told what arrived was not smoked salmon as expected but tinned. Disappointing - had to use in a pasta sauce. Maybe sent by mistake?
5,perfect,"This is perfection. You will never use a better knife. Unlike many other high quality knives, this knife also has weight to it that makes it more balanced. Plus, it's high enough quality, your grand kids will fight over it as their inheritance. This is the only tool I will ever call perfect...."
5,Excellent tool,"This knife has been my kitchen companion for years, and it has never missed a lick. Wonderfully balanced, easy to clean, and, with the right tools, easy to keep sharp. It has a heft that my wife (with smaller hands) finds cumbersome, but that is just perfect for me. I *love* this knife."
5,"Twin Pro-S 8"" Chef's Knive; Great","I've found this knife holds a good edge, fits my hand perfectly, has a nice heft, and is well balanced. This weighty blade is perfect for dicing vegetables as well as preparing various meats. I'd highly recommend it."
4,Top Notch Knife,"Grade A Blade, Bolster, Edge. The handle is solid but the only drawback is that it is somewhat heavy on the back end, and definitely heavier than a Wusthof handle."
4,"Initially slow, but excellent from middle to end","When I first started to listen to book, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to take it for the whole duration. However, after the first two cds I was completely hooked, and fell in love with the lead character, who had initially grated on my nerves to say the least. I highly recommend this audiobook, and encourage listeners to stick out the beginning, and they will be pleasantly surprised."
2,I Loved It Unabrided and Hated It Abridged,"Why I hate abridged audiobooks""When I get a chance to buy audiobooks, I always buy them unabridged. Many good things were left out of the Queen of Babble in the abridged copy. The abridged was a disappointed I just loved the unabridged."
4,Nice gift for Tbird owner.,"I bought this as a small cheap gift for my father, Owner of a restored '57 T-bird. Came in a nice box and seems like it won't fall apart with normal abuse. Fits with the motif and looks nice when he shows the car."
1,Looks good but is weak!,"It fell apart after my husband sat on it. I suppose you pay for what you get. And since it was only $60.00, that is what I got. My husband fixed it by adding some structure. So now it works as a piano bench for my very light child."
3,Special Delivery,"This is a typical Harlequin, quick, simple reads. It is the story of Roberta, a widower who goes into labor on the beach and along comes Kyle who helps deliver the baby. He keeps in touch through the years and five years later the meet again to celebrate the little girl's fifth birthday. Predictably, they fall in love and handle all the little obstacles that are always thrown into a typical Harlequin. It is a sweet story, but no great piece of literature. As long as you expect a quick, simple read, I would recommend it."
4,A skewed view of the King's concubine,"Princess Michael of Kent takes a very romantic view of Diane De Poiters. Poor Catherine De Medici is in love with her husband, but is villified for being unattractive and infertile. Of course, even after giving birth to 10 children, she is still way down on the list of her husband's preferences. Diane, 19 years the senior of the King, takes full advantage of his adolescent favor and obtains perferments for her children and great riches for herself. I couldn't help feeling sorry for Catherine. The only reason that Diane didn't get rid of Catherine ( in her 10 years of infertility) was because Diane was afraid that a younger wife might be more attractive to the King and eclipse her. I came away not admiring Diane one bit."
3,A skewed view; obviously anti medici,"I found this history of Henri II, Catherine de' Medici and Diane de Poitiers interesting for about the first third of the book. After that I found Princess Michael of Kent a hateful author. If she wanted to write a more flattering view of the King's Concubine that's fine but there was no reason whatsoever to be so hateful about Catherine De' Medici over and over she says Catherine could ""Hate and Wait"". She reduces the queen to a fat ineffectual brood mare and raises what is essentially the King's courtesan into a woman of dignity, class, and peity. It makes me wonder if this book is really about an historic french king or if it is about the current crown prince of England and his mistress."
2,BITCHY AND SUPERFITIAL,"the author made it clear who she love in this book .she made catherine out to be a bitter,fat brood mare.henri mistress diana as woman of beauty ,class and dignity.catherine was dealing with husband who made it clear he could never love her,preganacy after preganacy,and hostile court."
3,Title belies the subject......,"Great premise, but tedious writing - and this is really a book about Diane de Poitiers. The only thing the reader will come away with regarding the Medici queen is her policy of 'hate and wait' and that she paled in comparison to Diane's great beauty. The author should have just written about Ms. de Poitiers, whom she obviously favors. If you are looking for a compare/contrast-type history, this is not the book for you. Also, if you are looking for any interesting tidbits on Medici history (as I was) try Christopher Hibberts works."
2,somewhat disapointed,"I purchased this book interested in finding more insight into the relationship between Diane de Poitiers, Catherine de Medici and Henri IV. The beginning of the book talks about Francois his father and goes into a mini biography about him. I was somewhat disapointed when the rest of the book continued as such. There were minor descriptions of the struggles between Diane and Catherine, but not enough I think to title the book ""Two Rivals for the love of a Renaissance King"". This book was an overall summary of the Valois family."
3,Thank You HRH Princess Michael of Kent,"Thanks to HRH Princess Michael of Kent, I have finally discovered a sympathy for Catherine de' Medici. No matter what Princess Michael states in her book about the times, humans have always felt what one calls human emotions. Catherine de Medici spent her entire marriage having Diane de Poitiers' ""in her face"". Of course, Diane could afford to be generous to Catherine.....she had everything Catherine desired. So was Diane being generous to Catherine or merely flaunting her success as mistress and co-ruler in the face of her queen.I find this biased retelling of the story to be shameful from one who says she is descended from both women and would be fair to each as a result.Boy, I would really hate to read a book where Princess Michael stated her distaste for Catherine de' Medici. Wait!!! I just read Serpent and the Moon....I don't need another one."
3,HATE AND WRITE,I couldn't believe how much hatred the author had towards Catherine de Medici and how much she admired a devious woman like Diane. Her unflattering comments about Catherine weren't tasetful at all. What has happened to the English aristocracy today?
4,If you like history on European royalty...,"I really liked this book because it was very interesting to see the people in this history presented as real. Although the author really goes into too much detail about the wars and battles fought (I'm not into military history), for my taste, she presented the royals in this book very well."
2,Miata mx5 covercraft cover,"The quality was fine; however, it did not fit the seats as stated. It bulged in areas and unable to stretch enough to reach around the lower part of the seat."
5,My favorite Amazon purchase yet!,"Let me first say that I don't have a huge collection of kitchen knives, so my ability to compare to other knives is limited. At first glance, this knife does not appear that impressive. The handle is made of some plasticy material, not a wood handle like I am use to. After using this knife I was blown away. I never knew it was possible for me to cut vegetables like seen on TV! I have since bought this knife as gifts for family members."
4,Good knife,The knife came really sharp and I was able to use it right away. The only problem that I found was that it does not fit into my current knife block.
4,Worth the money,"This knife came boxed and packaged well.I took 1 star off for sharpness and I could see how other people posted about breaking the tip off, You would have to try. Its not that thin in my opinion but thinner then my 15 year old Henckel I am replacing.I have not tried to resharpen yet but see no reason this should need more then once a week touch up (home use). I did have a little trouble with soft tomatoes on the factory sharpen. Feels fine in the grip wet or not.It does seem worth the cash I spent."
5,Terrific chef's knife,"I don't have anything to add about this product, so I must repeat. Scalpel-sharp after a month of use. Fibrox handle material excellent.After having used the same Wustof (forged) chef's knife for years, I was concerned I wouldn't like a stamped blade. But I'm getting used to it, and I have no complaints except I wish I had been using this one all along.Update of January 19, 2009: Nope, I don't miss a forged blade at all. The edge of this Forschner is still sharp, and I am so glad to be grabbing a Fibrox handle instead of a slick one when carving up a turkey or a lard sculpture."
5,"excellent knife, highly recommended.",Wow! Is this knife sharp. Easy to hold and use evin with wet hands. Stays sharp a long time if you protect the edge with the optional blade guard.
3,Not bad but could be better,"My tip broke off when I was boning but it is still pretty functional. I also gave one of these to my n.eighbor as a gift she really likes it and it is a great improvement over the other knives that she owns. I bought this knife because it is highly recommended by America's Test Kitchen. It is very sharp, and light weight, dishwasher safe, and is a great value. I don't like it as well as my Wusthoff Grand Prix 7"" chef's knife. However, if you can't afford the Wusthoff, this is a good fall back. alternative."
5,like butter,"I have never been so excited about a knife! I've never used or can't imagine anything to be much sharper. I first used this knife on lemons and it sliced them like butter. It has a great feel in my hands, too (I have extremely small hands). It will be interresting to see how long it stays sharp. May buy a few more at this price."
4,Good knife for the price,"At this price point this is a good knife. Holds an edge well. This is not a short knife so be sure you want an 8"" blade. To get a better knife than this you'll have to jump to the $70-80. price range."
3,"Not bad, but the tip broke off","I liked the knife at first but after only a few months of light use, about 1/4"" of the tip seems to have broken off. This doesn't surprise me, as the blade is thin compared to the better knives.Update on this review: I was beyond the Amazon 30-day return period, but Victorinox was more than happy to replace it, emphasizing that all their products have a lifetime guarantee."
4,Great Knife at a Great Price,"I bought this knife based on a recommendation from Cook's Illustrated. It's sharp enough to cut just about anything, and light enough that it doesn't fatigue your hand or wrist. I clean mine in the dishwasher and haven't had any problems so far. I also own a paring knife from Victorinox, and I plan to buy the 6"" chef's knife as well. I always recommend this knife to friends who think they can't afford good knives."
5,MI SUPER CEBOLLERO,"EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, ES PURA CALIDAD, 100000% RECOMENDADO, GRACIAS X SU VENTA, ESTOY ENCANTADA COMO MI CUCHILLO SIN QUEJAS, TODO LO Q SE NECESITA EN UNA COCINA"
2,The good reviews must not have come back after the first six months to update,"When I first got this knife I was excited. It looked nice and had a great edge. I used it for about six months before I noticed the edge was chipping. I was too lazy to get warranty service and had been putting in the dishwasher, which I assumed was causing the unacceptable wear.I ordered another and here I am about 6 months later with the same problem. These knives are stamped crap. This one I have carefully washed and dried by hand after each usage. I only use them on standard plastic cutting boards.I recommend you go with a lower end forged knife like those from Mercer. This is what my friend uses and they seem like a much better investment."
3,Descent knife for price.,"I bought this knife because the cost was relatively low and it had great reviews. Despite the very good reviews, I was thoroughly disappointed in it. The knife has a cheap feel to it.....it is very light weight and doesn't feel like a strong blade. Also, the knife became dull over the first several months of using it despite even using a sharpening steel regularly. I realize you get what you pay for, but I thought because the reviews were so great that maybe this was really a good deal. Bottom line is, this is a descent knife if you only cook a few times a week, but if you are a serious cook that wants a serious knife, you should spend more money on a high quality knife."
3,GREAT HANDLE~LOW QUALITY BLADE,The blade chipped the second time I used it. The blade chipped when it came in contact with my fingernail while I was slicing Corned Beef. I am afraid to use the knife to separate chicken parts.The handle is awesome. It has a great shape and feel. The grip is secure wet or dry. I wish my Japanese Damascus Steel knife had this handle. I would have given this knife 1 star if it did not have a fantastic handle. I would have given this knife 5 stars if it had a premium quality blade.
4,Very sharp!,"Handles nicely, light weight and very sharp!! I have paid good money for good knives and this is a really great knife for it's price! Highly recommended by ""Cooking Illustrated""... and I can see why!"
5,Commercial... The best,The best for some one who uses it in a hose kitchen or for some one who is starting in cooking career. great blade quality.
3,Don't understand the hype,"I rarely review my purchases but my experience with this knife is so unlike the majority of the reviews I thought it would be helpful to share. (In fact I had to double check my ordering history b/c I was so surprised by these comments.)Out of the box, I found the feel of the knife to be both clunky & light - negative attributes I could live with given the price and that it was initially quite sharp. My problem is that the knife simply does not keep its edge. I cook with some frequency - probably every other night - and this knife lasted perhaps 2 months before it became almost unusably dull: barely getting thr onions, mashing tomatoes. Sharpened it - but it again lost its edge in a month or so. For the price, it's OK. But frankly I think my random hand-me-down knives and even the ""miracle knife"" I bought in a moment of infomercial-watching weakness are more durable. And it certainly doesn't compare to the better brands."
4,Great for the price. Not bad overall.,"I am a Shun knife user. My day to day kitchen chores get dome with either a 6 inch chef or a 6 inch santoku. But, I read a review about this inexpensive knife in a magazine, and had to try it out. It's pretty great actually. It slices clean through hard or soft stuff, anf it controls well. My only complaint is that it is awfully light in the hand. I like a little heft to do some of the work for me. It is solid though. Great for a new cook or someone who is moving out of the house. Also great for a grill set or camping set. If it gets lost of damaged, just buy a new one it's not like it costs $200 bucks or anything!"
3,Really Sharp - For awhile!!!,"When I opened the package and tried the knife for the first time, I thought I was using a razor blade - super sharp and slid through vegetables with remarkable ease. I was in heaven at finding a wonderful knife...and I have tried dozens and dozens looking for the ""perfect"" knife. After using the blade on approximately 5 different occasions, I notice the blade is breaking down rapidly - it is now no better than the ""run of the mill"" knives. It is still sharp but no where near the sharpness it was when first used. I am very careful with the use, cleaning and storage of knives and know how to use them well. A word of caution - With this knife, I actually was surprised at how easily it would go through an onion and cut myself for the first time in over 15 years. Luckily, it was a very small cut, but it could easily have been far worse. Even if you are experienced in using a very, very sharp knife, please take care."
5,"Great knife, bargain price","I've been using this knife for about 3 years and am just now getting around to reviewing it. There are many good reasons why this knife continues to be the winner of Cook's Illustrated's chef's knife quality comparisons. A knife's comfort and utility are, of course, subjective. This one is subjectively the best chef-style knife I've used in more than 40 year of cooking. It sharpens easily with a few swipes on the sharpener, it's a comfortable weight, nicely balanced, and the Fibrox handle is easy to keep clean and sanitary. Couldn't be happier with its performance."
4,It's worth the money,I bought this chef knife because i liked the price. Its better than my other Henkel knives(international) and is very sharp. I broke a piece of the blade by cutting trough chicken bones. I recommend this knive to everybody but keep in mind that this knife can't cut trough bones!
5,Awesome!,"No Joke--I've had this knife for over a year and use it multiple times daily. It's still sharp! I only hone it occasionally. The weight is good, handle is comfortable, and it cleans easily. And I love the concept of an inexpensive, high quality knife (apparently it's used at cooking schools to train the students)."
4,Nice value,Weighted well. Very sharp knife. Solid grip with good tactile feedback. Seemed priced adequately. No complaints thus far.Lifetime warranty.
4,I really like it but expected more,"Having read that Cook's Illustrated rated this the best knife for the money, I thought it would be a perfect knife.It's not. Don't get me wrong, it's a perfectly decent knife, hence the four stars.But it needs sharpening often. More often than I expected."
5,Sharp lil knife,"Never owned a fancy German knife, don't work in a professional kitchen or a butcher shop. All I know is this is a really good knife. I use it almost every day did so for about 3 weeks before I even had to hone it on the steel. Yep love it. Love it. LOVE IT!!"
4,non-slip handle?,"I am mostly pleased with this knife. It holds an edge pretty well. In the month, or so, that I have been using it, I've only had it on the stone once and a few times on a sharpening steel. I'm a little disappointed with the handle. Based on the reviews I read before buying it, I expected it to be much more non-slip than it actually is. Overall, it's a good knife for the price."
4,"NIce, easy to handle","I now reach for this knife more, preferring it over my more expensive ones. It's light but sturdy, easy to hold - though it's clearly made to be grabbed by the handle not with a pinch grip - and the curve of the blade makes slicing and chopping simpler."
4,"Sharp, light weight, wonderful product. :-)","Only concern is maybe the handle is little too light for me, it just make the knife feels not too high-quality.But the blade itslef is so wonderfully and pleasantly sharp. :-)"
5,Excellent Purchase,"I purchased this for my girlfriend who is a chef attending culinary school. She is currently working at a cooking internship away from home and she does not have her very expensive culinary knives with her, but still wants to cook at home for meals. This knife is extremely sharp and is generic enough that it can be used for almost all cooking tasks in the kitchen. The quality of the knife is extremely high, and if I didn't know better I would think it is a $150 knife, now flaws or quality defects whatsoever. I highly recommend this product, if you buy this knife you will not be disappointed."
5,"Great value, good wedding gift","After reading a review of chef's knives in Cooks Illustrated, I decided to take a risk and register for the Forscher/Victorinox 8-in as *the* chef's knife on our Amazon wedding registry. Since it was under $20, we had the luxury of asking for, and receiving, a pair of them. This has been a great knife for us. We cook a lot, and most of our prep is chopping veggies. This knife has a very sharp blade and is easy to handle. It sure beats our friends' more expensive Henckels chef's knife. What a value for under $20! I highly recommend giving this knife as a wedding gift. The Forschner/Victorinox serrated chef's knife is also fantastic."
4,A Sharp Cut,Finally at the age of 70 I get a real chef's knife. I can't believe how much better it is than the ones in the knife sets I have bought previously. I am taking very good care of it. No dish washer for it.And the price was very reasonable. Why didn't I do this a long time ago?
5,the best,"Dollar for dollar, these are the best knives available...The very few negative reviews are laughable, especially the one that says ""big and bulky""...these knives are relatively light and flexible, so the only cooks who won't like them are folks who are used to the heavier (and much higher priced) German knives...easy to sharpen and hold an edge with the best of them...5 stars for sure"
4,Forschner 8-inch chef's knife - Wonderful bargain!,"I think this knife must be the best knife going in this price range. It was difficult to find in brick-and-mortar stores, which is why I ordered it from Amazon. I can't afford the $200 chef's knives, so when I heard the glowing reviews of this one and saw how cheaply it could be had, I was thrilled. It's definitely the best knife I've ever had."
5,Simply 5 Stars,This knife is simply 5 stars. This is my second knife purchase of this type--this one is a present for a friend since I was so pleased with the knife myself. I take good care of the knife I own and love the ease in which I use it and what quick work it makes of cutting chores in the kitchen. I highly recommend.
3,overall decent knife for the price,Saw this knife on the toppp website. Not too sure why it is the highest overall rated knife. My first impression is that the knife is not well balanced. It's light and cuts well. I guess I would prefer the knife to have a bit more weight to it.
4,"great quality, grippy handle, cleaning a little more work","Like the title says, only one nit to pick (other than the lexan packaging that you will need to cut open) There is a hard to clean spot where the handle meets the blade (like all knives of this type). This makes the knife less expensive to manufacture, and means that the handle molding can be less precise. If this is the kind of knife you are looking for, and aren't willing to spend an extra 20 dollars to save on a little cleaning, then this is probably as good as it gets."
4,Great Product at a Great Price,Received my knife a few weeks ago. I love how it fits my hand and how it cuts. My only reservation is that it now has a couple of stains on the blade that won't clean off. I will be buying more of their knives.
5,great great deal on a non-forged knife,"this is sharp, agile, and an exception value for the price point. i make no claims on being more than just your standard guy in the kitchen, but this makes me feel like i'm chopping, slicing, and dicing on the food network. watch out for your fingers, kids. a+++ would buy again."
4,very nice knife for a starter,"I bought this knife recently and I am very impressed with its sharpness. Now cutting is a joy and it cuts everything like butter. I also bought a Shun 6' chef's knife which costs more than 2 times of this one, but the feeling of cutting is similar. My only complain is this one doesn't last very long, we cook every day and it needs sharpening about every 2-3 months."
5,Fantastic!,"I saw this knife reviewed in my Cook's Illustrated magazine. Average price, it said, was $24.95. I got two for that price and gave one to my sister. Love the knife. It is lightweight yet cuts beautifully! I use it everyday and am so glad I purchased it. Will definitely continue to tell others about it and would buy again."
4,Like it,"This is a very good knife, and has an excellent grip and weight. I was hoping to use this for more carving, but it's not quite built for that. It works for this, though, just not as smoothly as I would like. This is does a fantastic job of slicing and anything involving the ""rocking"" motion. Recommended."
5,Surprisingly excellent,"Very very sharp and the no-slip handle is a definite plus. We own several very expensive European knives, but this Victorinox is a hidden secret...It exceeds the utility of our other knives made by famous ""Classic"" manufacturers....and it is a fraction of the cost of those other knives."
5,Great Knife - Great Balance and Edge,Easy to use. Great balance and grip. Sharpens razor sharp and holds its edge. I use it over $200 and $300 chef's knives.
5,A beautiful knife at a great price,"This knife is a beauty. We use a ceramic sharpener with it to keep it sharp. The Fibrox handle stays true to it's name by not losing its grip even when wet. However, be forewarned that you shouldn't put this in your dishwasher, as mentioned in the instruction manual, as it'll leave water spots on the handle and will make your blade less sharp. This knife was highly recommended by Cook's Illustrated magazine and it hasn't disappointed us."
5,A fantastic knife for a fantastic price.,This is an amazing value. I've used high-end knives and low-end knives and this is a utilitarian wonder. I highly recommend it.
5,great knife,"Love this knife! Have been looking for a knife for some time, and this one is perfect all around useful kitchen item at a great price."
2,It's Ok,"I've had this for almost 3 years now, but don't use it much any more. At the beginning it was alright, but it just can't maintain a sharp edge after the second use."
1,Overrated!,Too much money for such a cheaply manufactured knife. Save you cash and buy something else with better quality! Look elsewhere!
3,"Sharp when new, not so much later","I've had this knife for about nine month and used extensively(almost everyday) for about 6 month. It was very sharp when I first got it and I was quite happy at the time. It was until about a month ago, when my roommate got the 9' version of this knife, that I realized it became a little blunt by comparison. It's not as sharp as the new one. A week ago, I bought a Zwilling Pro S 7' knife (http://www.amazon.com/Zwilling-J-A-Henckels-7-Inch-Santoku/dp/B0000DDVFV/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top), which is incredibly sharp. The Zwilling cut thru any meat with almost just gravity working. I know, that one costs a lot more. So with the price of this knife, I give it a three star. Not so impressive as you keep using it, but still worth the money."
4,Single edge sharpened?,It appears that Victorinix uses an odd sharpening system. I had to use an Asian sharpening system after the blade became dull. Worked as well as when knife was new. The steeel holds an edge for quite a while.The only reason not to rate this with 5 stars is that there are no sharpening cautions in the product reviews.
5,Fantastic sharpness and great handle,"Over the years I have purchased several knives, from the sharp but high maintenance Japanese blades to the sharp enough but low maintenance German blades. This time I was looking for some inexpensive Chef's knives, and as the reviews appeared glowing I bought one. I liked it so much that I bought two more. They are well balanced and make quick work of any chopping tasks I have put them though. If I needed a basic set of knives, I would just buy this, their 6 inch version and a pairing knife. I have those as well and they are sharp and effective."
4,Value for money,I have had this knife for a while now. It is quite good for the money. I would recommend it and have even bought 2 more to give to family for their use.
5,Bold and Unafraid,"This knife is not afraid. I saw a review of this knife in a well-known cooking and kitchen-product testing magazine: it got high marks for stability, effectiveness, and price, if I recall correctly. I'm not about to get married anytime soon, so I figured the only way to get a good knife was to buy one myself. I bought this knife to see what this knife line was all about. It's invincible!"
5,I love this knife!,"I was looking for a chef's knife for my mother-in-law. This one was inexpensive, but still rated highly by Cooks Illustrated as well as here on Amazon. I ended up getting three, including one for myself. All three of us absolutely love the knife. The blade is large and sharp and the textured handle is really nice! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great chef's knife at a great price."
5,quality knife saves time and is better ergonomically than my old heavy chef knife,Received this knife about four weeks ago. It is lightweight and easy to use and very sharp. I wished I had purchased one many years ago. It is so much less work to chop and slice large vegetables. Reasonably priced and arrived on time.
4,best Chef's Knife at this price point,"Based on our own experience with this model, we bought the 8 inch Victorinox 40520 Chef's knife as a gift for a cooking friend. It is one of the least expensive knives in our kitchen, but its size, balance, sharpness, and dexterity make it our ""go-to"" cook's knife. I was afraid it would be too big but it handles beautifully. Highly recommended."
5,chef's knife,"The knife is excellent. Quality is excellent. Weight and Balance are very good. This knife was rated very highly by Cook's Magazine, over much more expensive Chef's knives. It is the nicest knife I have ever had and the only Chef's knife I will ever need. Sincerely, Linda Marsh"
4,Couldn't believe it... Nice Home kitchen go to knife!,"Forschner/Victorinox, Fibrox Handle 8"" Chef's knife... By far best bang for the buck out there! Bought it for my wife to use, don't trust her with my Forged Victorinox 10"". CRAZY Sharp, Super light, well balanced! I prefer the handle feel on my forged but, I could get used to it for the price! Priced like China but, Swiss Made!!!"
5,Great Knife,I'm a beginner and this knife is great and not too intimidating. I have small hands and it is not too heavy. Does just what I need it to.
4,Impressive for the price,"We chose this knife based on America's Test Kitchen recommendation. It has lived up to the expectations we had going in - it handles all of our daily prep needs and has become the favored knife in our kitchen. Both my husband and I find it comfortable and easy to use, something that isn't always the case with his hands being considerably larger than mine."
1,Lost its sharpness in a week,"I bought this item after reading all the reviews about it and thought that it was a good deal. It was an amazing knife for the first few days, really sharp, precise cuts, even when cutting tomatoes, I didn't really have to put any pressure on the knife, but after a week or so, it started turning blunt. Surprisingly so! So, unless you have a home knife sharpener, I do NOT recommend this product to anyone at all. I was pretty disappointed."
1,not nearly as good as the reviews,"Was definitely expecting something much more wonderful than what arrived based on all the great reviews. Feels very cheap. It's extremely light and flimsy, and the handle just feels like crappy plastic. I would not recommend these knives at all."
1,Sucks,Dull knife. Hate the plastic handle. A pain to sharpen and it still doesnt get really sharp. My cheap $7 knife cuts better.
1,Wrong item sent!,"This was sent as a gift. I was surprised when the recipient sent me a confused thank you for the cookie sheet. Even though the packing slip said it was the knife, what he got was a cookie sheet. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to explain this problem to Amazon's customer service. Maybe they read reviews."
3,not bad....,"won't lie. For the price, it's not bad.You can tell it's not close to the sharpness of a MAC knife. (my brand of choice).But if you're going on a camping trip and you want a *decent* knife then bring along the victorinox.the knife needs work out of the box. stone and a rod.it can be banged around and for ~ $20-40 for victorinox they're a good value. But they dull easilyand wedge when cutting."
1,poor performance,"despite the high reviews of other users, i have found this knife to be dull and not worth the money."
1,"Very disappointed, but price really tells all","This knife is AWFUL! It's extremely bulky and heavy, but furthermore it's not even sharp! Please,do yourself a favor and spend the extra $30-40 and get a Wusthof. Their knives are GREAT and they are a bit more expensive, but it's WORTH IT, I promise!"
5,sharpest tool in the block,I really like this knife. It has good balance and stays very sharp. To say this knife is not sharp or doesn't perform very well is ludicrous. I read some of the very few low reviews and had to wonder if they were using the same knife.
5,Great Knife for the price,"I purchases this knife after my Cuiseinart knife was just not cutting it. At first I thought it was too light to handle my heavy cooking, but it arrived so razor sharp that I am making up excuses to find more food to cut! I wish that the handle had a bit more expensive feel (kinda plasicky) but that is my only complaint. Nice Job!"
4,Light but not Flimsy,"I bought this knife because it was so highly-rated by Cook's Illustrated. My previous Calphalon chef's knife was too heavy, and the blade was too thick for me to use easily.The new Forschner chef's knife is great! The blade is big, sharp, and maneuverable. The handle is comfortable, with a non-slip surface.A thinner, lighter blade with a simple plastic handle should feel cheap...but this doesn't. It cuts precisely, and carves meats beautifully. I sliced both thin scallions and a thick London Broil with equal ease, and minced an onion in record time.Overall, this is an amazing value for a chef's knife, whether it's your first big knife, or you're replacing a chef's knife that just doesn't cut it. You'll be amazed at what $20 can buy!"
4,good knife,I've enjoyed working with it so far. Not to much money and effective for work. Only been using it for two weeks at this point but no complaints
4,"A bargain, a good first knife","Great price, good knife, good feel in the hand. Sufficiently sharp when new, though it became noticeably duller fairly quickly. We just moved into our own place a month ago, and we bought this knife to be our first as we learn basic cooking. It's serving us well as a first knife, and I don't regret the purchase, but if we could have afforded something better, a better knife probably would have been worth it."
5,Great Value,This is a very good knife. It is comfortable and versatile. I've had it over a month and use for almost every task in the kitchen. It is still very sharp. For the money it is the most valuable knife I have purchased.
4,Hell of a knife.,Knife feels great. If you are looking for a thick hefty knife look elsewhere. Knife is rasor sharp. Fibrox handle feels great. Best knife for the money.
5,as advertised,"R.H. Forschner by Victorinox 8-Inch Chef's Knife, Black Fibrox HandleThis is an excellent knife - great design, razor sharp."
4,Great knife - good price,"This knife is extremely sharp out of the box and well balanced. It has the proper weight in hand to cut through even tougher foods. And the price is much lower than its competitors, for pretty much the same quality."
5,Great knife for cheap!,"I can't say enough great things about this knife. I work as a personal chef, and it's invaluable for the hours of prep work I do each week. Stays sharp very well, with the occasional run against the back of a ceramic plate. Love it."
5,Slices throught big veggies no problem,"I originally bought this to give to a friend, but I ended up keeping it. I use it to cut larger veggies like broccoli and cauliflower. It is just way to easy to use. It is very sharp and remains very sharp after a year of lots of use. I don't hand wash it, I usually put it on the top rack of the dishwasher. It works just fine. I would recommend this and get others like this."
5,The best deal on a knive,"Anyone into kitchen knives should know about Forshners/Victorinox. My brother, who was a butcher in a family run grocery during his college years, turned me on to these knives. Cooks illustrated ranks this 8"" chefs knive as their highest rated and best value chefs knife. 2 others rated as high as this knife cost close to $200. Why spend more. Buy other Forshners (paring, butcher, etc.) with the money saved."
3,"OK knife, but nothing special","With over 500 reviews I expected Victorinox to be something special, but I am disappointed. The first thing I noticed was how thin and flexible the blade is compared to my German chef's knifes. The Victorinox is a nice step up from economy knives sold in you local grocery store, but it pales in comparison to a decent professional chef's knife. A quality German knife does not have to be expensive. I highly recommend checking out theMessermeister Four Seasons 8-Inch Chef's Knifeavailable here at Amazon. The Messermeister has a thick quality stamped blade, a comfortable non-slip handle, and is just as sharp as the Victorinox, for only $14 more."
4,"Not for small hands, but a great knife!","This is a great knife - a little lighter than my preference, but it is sharp, appears sturdy, and the handle has *superb* grip. I didn't know a handle could be so superbly grippy until using this knife.But! A caution for the WOMEN purchasing knives... unless you have larger hands than the average gal, consider a smaller knife. I know, I know - always consider dimensions before you order. But! I didn't, and while this knife is still usable, I think a reminder is in order that the size of knife considered ""small"" or ""mini"" by many knife manufacturers is actually what women can more confidently and comfortably use. This is large enough to be ungainly in my hands.Great knife - just double-check that it's the right size for your hand first, by measuring a knife you already know and love."
4,Feels good,"This knife is lightweight, sharp, and feels good in the hand. I don't know if I would say it's the sharpest thing ever like some reviews are saying, but it definitely is a step up from your standard kitchen knife and the price is right for sure. You can buy a bunch of these for how much it costs for one of those fancy premium knives and I doubt the difference in price would be worth it. I trust Victorinox and if you are familiar with their products you know that you can't go wrong."
5,No-brainer,"Blade: Knife arrived incredibly sharp. After some additional sharpening, the blade is razor sharp. The smooth polished blade does not grab and lift food as you cut. The curvature of the blade makes it very easy to rock for quicker and more efficient cutting.Comfort: The handle is large, comfortable, and the Fibrox material provides a very good grip (both dry and wet). The weight of the knife conveys quality and durability, yet is light and easy to use.Value: I looked high and low for an affordable high-quality knife. After having used this knife, I don't think it gets any better than the Victorinox 8"" Chef's Knife."
4,Great knife,"Like this knife a lot. No major complaints. Doesn't slice through some harder-skin things (like older lemons) like I might have expected, but that could very well be my inexperience. I'm not a chef, just a hobbyist cook, and bought this on recommendation of Cook's Illustrated etc. Very pleased with it."
4,Knife too large for my hand,"I had no problem with the quality of the Victorinox 8"" chefs knife. It just seemed too big for my hand to use it properly. The blade was too wide for my liking. I'm used to a somewhat narrower/thinner knife. I had a beauty school instructor tell me once that he had to try out many scissors/shears before he found the right one to fit his hand. I think I will go into a local restaurant store and try them out before I buy another one. Even though America's Test Kitchen recommended this knife it just wasn't right for me and I returned it."
3,It's alright,"I don't know what's with all the rave reviews. It was super sharp when I first received it 3 months ago and it slowly wore it's way down. I can't imagine all the reviewers knowing how to sharpen their own knives or even sending it out to have it professionally sharpened. To be honest with you, it's so thin that I'm scared to sharpen it on my own. I probably cook 2-4 times per week to give you an idea of how often I use it. Guess it's Wustoff or Henckel time..."
1,Low Quality Junk,"I have used Victorinox products in the past in my restaurant, and received this knife as a gift from a friend that purchased off Amazon. The blade was thinner than the models of the exact same knife I had in the past, plus the first one had the tip broke off and the edge looked like it had been used -- so I thought I got a return, which I have seen on other postings is happening more often on Amazon. So my friend had a second one sent and it looked new and came in a different package than the first, but the edge didn't last very long. I sharpened it, but the edge didn't sharpen like the others I have, making me think the metal was changed. I have been reading that a bunch of Victorinox fakes out of China have been sold on Amazon, so I don't know if I got one or not or if the quality is just poor."
2,"Exceptional price, but awful handle","Despite being VERY sharp, a terrific value, and rated highly by America's Test Kitchen, I ended up mostly scared of using this knife. Yes, I know how to hold and use a chef's knife, but this one just wouldn't stay stable for me. I ended up replacing it with an 8"" Messermeister Elite which I LOVE. The Messermeister is nicely weighted, plenty sharp, feels great in my hand, and most importantly stays stable."
1,Unhappy cook,I bought this chef knife in January 2010 because it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen. The edge of the knife is chipped away already and I did not notice it until I was about to wash it. Where did the chips go? I could not eat the meal I had just put into the oven because it may have metal chips in there.
1,Will easily cut warm butter,Silly little piece of metal thought it was a knife. At the price I paid I didn't expect much and that is what I got. If you need something that will hold an edge long enough to cut more than one carrot or you are looking for something ergonomically sound...look elsewhere
2,i wish people would wait to review this knife...,"We;ve had this knife since february - not even 3 months - and last night I dropped it while doing dishes and the tip of the blade chipped off - keep in mind, i didn't throw it at my kitchen tiles, i dropped it. I have 2 toddlers so luckily we found the chipped piece, but seriously? 2 months of recreational use (I'm not a chef, I don't use it all day long) - this is crazy! The ""lifetime warranty"" requires that i send it in (with my $) to a repair facility - ridiculous! - waste of money. works well I guess, but I don't feel like purchasing a new one every year."
5,very nice knife,"Cuts clean and effortlessly. I have had this for two months, and have not sharpen yet despite a lot of use"
5,"Best ""bang for the buck"" Chef's Knife","This knife gets five stars from me, there are better knives out there but none at this price point. I am amazed at how well this knife holds it's edge. My only criticism is that it is pretty light, it's not as substantial as better chef knives. But again, I still use this knife more frequently than any other. And there's no chance of buyer's remorse."
4,"great knife, especially for the price","I've had it for a few months and steeled it about a half-dozen times. It's starting to dull, and it would be nice if it held sharpness a bit longer. Still, it's better than most of the other knives I've had that cost a bit more. Granted, I've never owned a fancy knife that cost more than about $50, but this makes me happy otherwise."
5,Awesome Knife!,I love this knife! It does an amazing job and I literally look forward to using it daily. You can't go wrong with this knife.
4,nice knife,"I bought this knife to carve the Thanksgiving turkey. I like the balance and the size. Think it could be more sharp, but expect it to improve after I sharpen it myself."
5,years of faithful service,"I bought this knife 14 years ago on the recommendation of the owner of a knife store and have not regretted it for one moment. It is comfortable and shows no sign of wear. There are no issues with it holding an edge. I have had it professionally sharpened a couple of times, but most of the time I use the accusharp sharpener and the edge comes back nicely. I use it every day for almost every kitchen use. It is lighter than most ""professional"" knives, which I like. For a dedicated home cook this is a knife that will last you a lifetime."
5,Swiss Made Excellence!,"Swiss made, this knife by Forschner is the highest grade you can purchase. It's technically an 8"" chef's knife and the stainless steel can be sharpened repeatedly, even though it holds it edge very well. The fibron handle has a strong grip and prevents slipping. The Swiss make great clocks, army knives and now this `series' of culinary knives that are `top-of-the-line'. It's so good there is a lifetime warranty. In fact this IS the company that makes Swiss Army Knives! I suggest buying a set if you are truly into good cooking. Voted #1 by ""Culinary Magazine""."
1,poor spoon,"Don't buy it. My baby only used it for a few mins, then I found a lot of scratches on it. Hope no hazardous for my baby."
4,Toddler - not Baby spoon,"The spoons themself are great - not cheap plastic! However, it would help to know that these are NOT intended for babies...unless your baby has a very wide mouth. I'll be saving mine for when my daughter is a toddler - but for now, I had to re-order the Gerber baby spoons.Overall - great spoons...I just wanted to let others know that these are for ""larger babies"" :)"
4,Great Toddler Spoons...but they stain,"I bought these spoons for my 13 month old when she began reaching for our silverware at dinnertime. These spoons are short and thick-handled, and perfect for little hands. The only drawbacks that I have seen in a few months of use are that the white plastic tends to stain, like most white/clear plastic, its going to get stained with spaghetti sauce, and the spoon is a bit shallow to ""scoop"" something up. But all in all, am very happy with these and we have bought two more sets."
2,Poor design,"While the handle is easy to grip, it is weighted too heavily. When my toddler places it back in her bowl, it flips out of the bowl and flings food everywhere. I don't see how this flaw was not caught during product discovery and testing. As others say, it does have a wide mouth, so determine if that is good or bad for you. I like the depth of the bowl, I think flat spoons don't allow your toddler to scoop things onto the spoon. Overall, the food flinging aspect at this ridiculous price makes them a rip-off. Sill looking for a good toddler spoon."
4,"Good handles, the spoon itself a little wide",Our son holds the handle well but the spoon itself is a little wide for our 14-month old.
5,love 'em,"my 6 mos old loves her spoons - and the bonus is that she gnaws on them in every direction like a teether, though she hasn't sprouted any teeth yet. she easily grabs them and puts them in her mouth in both directions. the spoon head is a little wide, but is fine, and she is still learning the eating thing so, i'm sure this will not make any difference soon."
5,A great spoon and teether,"These are great spoons. Like you, I read a bunch of reviews for baby spoons. What is wrong with us?! Anyways, here are the pros and cons.Pros:- cute eyes on the handle- it picks up food real good- dishwasher safe- baby likes to gnaw on the handle like a teether- thick enough handle, my baby can hold the spoon himself (since 6 months old)- the spoon is similar enough to a regular non-baby spoon, which I think helps the baby be able to use them when you forgot to pack your baby spoon.Cons:- oily (especially tomato sauce based) foods tend to dye the spoon handle, but it comes out after 1 or 2 washes in dishwasher.Stop reading reviews about spoons! It will drive you crazy! I'm sure any spoon will do. :)"
5,Good as always!,"These books are great! Each book just seems to be getting more involved, interesting, and full of suspense! Can't wait to read the next one!"
4,"Still cool, but getting stale","I really hate to give this book such a low rating, because I love this series, but Zoey is really starting to bug me.She used to be my favorite charecter(it was a tie between her and Nina), but lately she's really getting on my nerves. Lucas' father just died and all she can think about is herself, and how he should think about her all the time. I think Lara has the right idea, make Zoey's life misrable, it should make for interesting drama. Better yet,Lara, send her to the rehibilitation hospital, maybe they can give her a new personality. She needs it."
1,Save your money! I wish I did!,Loaded with factual errors and mislabeled photographs. A little bit of research on so many of the anecdotes in this book(?) would have proven them to be untrue (the Manson story is particularly offensive in it's inaccuracy). It tries to pass off fake posters printed in the late '90s as artifacts from the 60s and early 70s. This trash isn't worth the paper it's printed on. A real amateur job.
2,Appears to be mostly fiction,"The book has stories of people talking and you get the idea the authors weren't there. Whether its Humble Pie's Steve Marriot talking to Peter Frampton about a fire at the Whiskey or The Who talking about groupies, the dialogue sounds totally canned... totally un real. There are posters in the back of the book too of shows at the Whiskey. But they aren't The Real Posters. The authors made them too. They are just fantasy. Is ANY of this book authentic? Or is just a way the two character writers could make some money on gullible fans of LA lore. I'm half way through the book now and my disappointment is palpable. A Ouigi Board would have been more accurate that the baloney featured here."
4,The Church Impotent,"I think its a good read and has shed some light on the topic for me at least. I have wondered why so often the ladies in a church have way more to do with how things are to be run then thier male counter parts. I think this book has some really good points as to the where's, why's and how's of this. db"
1,Disappointing,"I found the book to be sloppily argued. Some chapters are nothing more than a hodgepodge of different sources strung together to fit Podles' thesis, while others rely much too heavily on his own unexamined assumptions about both Christianity and masculinity. I wanted to learn more about the subject of the feminization of Christianity, but ended up only learning more about Podles."
3,"Not a Review, but a Comment on the Thesis","This is just a first impression from reading the synopses and comments here.Podles' thesis -- that contemporary Christianity is highly ""feminized"" -- reminded me that there another religion out there.Christianity's historic rival, whose radical forms have a reputation for hypermasculine-to-male-supremacist behavior, has often been described as a ""Man's religion"". If Christianity keeps appealing to ""feminized men"" and rejecting the masculine, we just may see a masculine spirituality go hypermasculine to the cry of ""Allah Akbar!"""
1,Seriously Flawed Argument,"Instead of laying a Biblical grid down on the purported problem real men have with Christianity, Podles lays a socio-cultural masculinity grid on Scripture. He finds, therefore, the biblical bridal paradigm to be wanting, rather than pervasive and compelling. In Podles view it's certainly not the real men who have it wrong.(...)"
2,could not get this battery to charge. I put it in the charger it blinks only',I never could get this battery to charge I tried at least 20 times all it would do is blink.
1,Hoop Ring,I can't even use it. It's actually too small for any of todays rims. The concept is nice but most of the rims today are thicker. This is set to be used on a very old thin type of rim. It's never been used and I'm very disapointed in it.
1,did not like it,did not like it send t back its not the ring its dilettante to gees what its for do not recommend this item
5,best brand of knife,Henckels is the best quality if you stick to their Pro series. Skip their International line. This paring knife will last forever and fits well in the hands of both me and my much larger housemate. Holds it's edge well. Good tools make the job go well!
3,"Good knife, but an uncomfortable size.","I bought this thinking I'd be happier with it than a shorter paring knife, but I think that may have been an error. The blade itself is sharp and cuts nearly anything, but I find I use it minimally. Its too big for any high detail work, where I find myself fumbling and too small for any rougher work, where I endlessly reach for my santoku knife.Remarkably, the only area I've found it highly effective for me is for sandwich making, where I previously used my santoku and a dinner knife. It can easily work its way through an onion or any other vegetable you'd want on the sandwich and allow for more simple tasks (like spreading condiments, cutting the sandwich, etc.) due to its nice length."
1,"Professional S 3"" Paring Knife","I ordered Henckels Pro S 3"" paring knife item # 31020-083 received a chinese knockoff item # 31460-081. It said it was a Henckels knife, but it was made in China, have never known of a Henckels knife Made in China. Package was wrong for the product too. Make sure that what you order from this company, MFS Wholesale LLC, is what you will get. I had to ship knife back and get refund. No problem there, but this should not have happened to begin with."
2,received wrong knife,I received a different knife than I ordered. Still works well but it doesn't have the same 3 circles on it. Disappointed that it doesn't match the rest of my set.
5,Great Knives,Henkel Pro S knives are second to none. They will last a lifetime and make a tremendous difference in your cooking. These knives take the 'chore' out of cutting vegis.
2,Sharp at both ends! Handle can shave wood (where the plastic fractures off),"When the plastic fractures, the butt end of the handle has exposed metal with an edge that is sharp enough to shave wood. Mine takes shavings off of a toothpick and that's the HANDLE that is that sharp. You want to be careful how you hold the knife, with such a sharp edge on the handle. It ---supposedly--- has a ""lifetime warranty"" but Zwilling has not responded to concern over the handle's sharp edge. Apparently the manufacturer feels that this is ""normal"" for the plastic handle to fracture and, consequently, not a service issue. (It happened with another Henckels knife, also). If they didn't set the rivets so tightly into the plastic handle, perhaps the plastic handles wouldn't be so prone to fracture."
3,Good knife yet not the quality of the zwilling,"One has to read the descriptions carefully. Not having shopped before for these knives, thought a Professional S was the top of the line. Doesn't have quite the feel of the Zwilling and is made in China, not in Germany. Another knife I bought is a Zwilling and there is a difference. Still, a good knife for the price."
1,Not the item pictured--cheap knockoff,"Buyer beware. The item you get is not the item pictured. It's not made in Germany, but rather made in China and it doesn't have the feel of a Professional S knife. Thinner, lighter, cheaper. Not a $50 knife. More like a $10 knife."
5,Knives,"I have owned this set for 10 - 12 years. I think that they are worth their weight in gold, a true value at twice this price.They slice through meat, veg. & breads (even soft tomatoes), like a razor blade on a handle.The knives stay sharp for years. I have them professionally sharpened about every 2 -3 years. However, if you hon them often they will never need sharpening.I have seen many professional well renouned chefs use these knives. When I was researching knives for this purchase, a Chef from the ""Greenbrier Resort"" (a WV 5*hotel)reccommended these to me. I will never own another brand or style of knives."
3,Lid Too Low for Large-Breasted Turkey,"While the oven is advertised as capable of roasting a 20-lb. turkey, I had to cut off the breastbone to get the lid to close enough to roast the bird. Otherwise, the oven worked well."
3,Cute Costume,"This costume looked very cute, but as I read in other reviews it was very thin and cheaply made. It also was very small. My son is 32 in long and 28 lbs and they sent me the 3t and it fit well except for being a little long. I hope this helps anyone looking to order with sizing. Even despite the thin material it was a big hit at his school's Halloween parade!"
2,Wig is NOT attached to hood!,"I assumed the wig was sewn onto a hood, so that I'd have an easier time putting it on my son, who is 13 months. It's just a regular wig."
2,You're paying for the footnotes on this one,"--and possibly a slightly more colloquial translation & scholarly academic introduction :D. The Library of LiberalArts edition is available for a lower price, minus footnotes & intro."
1,This is just a man talking.,"You see a lady, but not much, really nothing like Dancehall Jamaica, thats is what I was looking for at all.."
4,"Great Basic 20"" LCD","I've always loved the crisp, clear images on NEC monitors...with this one set to 1600 x 1200 resolution...WOW!Just wish they would have thrown in a DVI cable so I could use the new DVI-compatible monitor with my DVI video card!"
4,Works well but mod needed,"Installed in Porsche 996 but needed several adjustments to get it working correctly. Once done, it works well and I like the discrete feature.The main issue was the cable that goes from the radar unit to the remote display. The male/female plug went bad only after a month or so......error messages all the time. Ended up cutting and soldering the three very thin lines and that took care of the problem. The other issue is the installation of the radar unit. The supplied brackets really didn't fit anywhere. Made a makeshift bracket from parts lying around the garage and installed inside the bumper which was accessible by removing the headlight unit. The laser adapter was useless. Read somewhere that the laser is targeted at the front license plate, but the adapter is to be installed only inside. That's it. Thinking about installing a second unit in the other car."
2,display broke after two months,"i got this detecter because of its discreetness and the price. for the first two months the detector worked perfect, but after a long road trip the detector's screen would not come about 80% of the time but the sound still works. i have not contacted whistler yet but plan too.updatejust emailed Whistler. they said to check the laser probe because wire could be kinked. i have to take apart my dash to do it so i have not checked it yet."
1,Never buy an other Whistler product,"This product worked for about 30 seconds.Customer service is poor, too much of a hassle to return the product and no/minimal control over outcome.I might have lost my money on a poorly designed product, but they lost a customer for life."
4,Recommend Pro-3450,"If you want a reliable radar detector that does not sit on your dashboard or stick to your windshield and does not cost an arm and a leg, this is it. You need to be a little bit handy to install it. It is your basic remote detector, but gets the job done. I have used this product as well as other Whistler products for many years with no complaints."
5,Saved me ten times what it cost,I bought this radar detector in October of 2004. It is now January 2012 and this thing still saves me money. I drive regularly from Long Island NY to the mountains in PA and driving through NJ is not easy. I am not a speedster AT ALL but driving 55 or 65 is a joke. There are 18 wheelers doing 90 because they warn each other where the smokeys are on their CB radios. I myself just try to avoid the tailgaters so I set me cruise control to the flow of all the rest of the traffic... I'm a center lane driver and I like it.This thing has saved me dozens of tickets a year... too many times to count. My only complaint is I purchased the voice module and it is tinny sounding. It eventually stopped working for some reason.I like having this unit because it is hidden from sight (you don't have to have it in the windsheild like the others). This is important if you park on the street often. Theives will break your window if the see a suction cup mount in the window.
5,A must have flashlight!,"After recently purchasing an Inova XO as a gift, I decided on the XO3 for myself. WOW! I thought the XO was bright! The XO3 smothers out the wash from the XO like it's not even there, and the XO is also a great light! I use this light for hiking at night, crawling around in people's attics at work and any other reason you'd need a light. I have bought many lights over the years and trust me, this is the best light for the money. It even has pretty good throw, which is not an LED's strong point. Nice white, crisp light as well."
4,Easy to use and protective caps is a must,Easy to use and protective caps is a must if going to mount in weather. Had to drop one star due to mfg putting the extra little plastic in middle which prevents easy use with other brand.
4,I got attached,"I liked this book. I was excited when I found out that I was right. I feel this is a neat spin on the murder mystery story line. I got frustrated with the characters, though, b/c personally I would have chosen a different path. I was disappointed in the last chapter. It was put together poorly and was as painful to read as watching the American Idol tryouts. With that being said, it didn't ruin the book for me. All in all enjoyable and addictive."
4,"interesting, couldn't put it down","I read this book after being pleased with another MTV book. I can honestly say that it lived up to the standards set by ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower."" I would recommend this book to anyone in the mood for a suspenseful mystery in an unlikely setting."
3,A fun read,"The kind of world we want to live in isn't the world we *should* live in nor is such a utopia something we should protect.Those are the most interesting themes emerging from Jane Goldman's ""Dreamworld."" Regrettably, they're not the main attractions. The action-thriller ride is, and the ironic message comes through just strongly enough to make this more than your typical adventure story.The plot is predictable but fun and graced with sexy characters and enough pop-culture references to impress writers for ""The Simpsons."" Slap ""Michael Crichton"" or ""Elmore Leonard"" on the cover, and -- along with MTV's backing -- this likely would be a bestseller.Central Florida residents also will appreciate the homework Goldman apparently did to bring the area to life.It would be interesting to see how a more mature Goldman would have handled this book. More serious or more action?Still, the foreshadowing of a successful career is written into ""Dreamworld."" Readers can look forward to her next offering."
2,Totally predictable,"I bought this book because I heard a good review about it. As it turns out the book was predictable and sometimes confusing. I had to force my self to finish it. It does have it's exciting and suspenseful points, but not enough. I couldn't get used to the way she wrote- like using the first and last name all the time and explaining the same point over again in each chapter. In the end, I was like ""that's it?!"", but I was also glad to get it over with."
2,Bored me to death,"Two of my greatest loves are amusement parks and mystery novels. So I had rather high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, it was not interesting enough for me to actually finish it. The mystery felt extremely empty, and there were far too many times when the writing felt akin to an annoying co-worker's incessant babbling. I wound up skimming through to the end to see what was going to happen. Once I'd done that, I gave the book to my sister.It's not often that I am unable to finish a book. But I just couldn't do it with this one."
2,Be careful that you are buying the right size,"Be careful when purchasing this product. The 1 1/2"" appears to refer to the pipe size, not the size of the hex nut that the wrench will fit. The part of the wrench that engages the hex nut is almost 2"" across and will not work on a 1 1/2"" nut.I'm sure the wrench works fine when it fits, but the product description is very misleading."
1,Cellular carrier shortsightedness ruins a great concept,"The idea of a prepaid cellphone card is fantastic. Unfortunately T-Moblie limits the ""life"" of the card once you start to use it. For example a $ 50.- good for 250 minutes is only valid for 60 days after activation. This defeats the puepose of alowwing people to have a no hassle, no bills, no credit checks cellphone. In Europe, prepaid cellphone cards, with a dedicated number are valid for several months. You can buy a cheap GSM phone, buy a prepaid card and you have your number on the spot. The card and it's recharges last months.I don't mind identifying myself, let know who is using a cellphone. I don't need to be stuck with a contract full of fine print and a monthly bill."
5,Very Good,This is a great deal! This ois so far the cheapest most reliable pre pay service. I would not choose another company for my cell phone service!
5,worldview changing!,"This is SO different from any other book about sex you will ever read. But different in a GREAT way. This is about how sexual incompatibilies (big or small) are normal, WHY they are normal, and how to resolve them. Every single married couple should read this book, maybe repeatedly."
1,Didn't like the format and found another book much more helpful,"I love to read and so does my husband, however, I think that the format of a book is very important. This book is laid out with very tiny print that is crammed together and reminds me of an encyclopedia, or more like the fine print on a credit card offer. To me it is also very ""wordy."" Don't get me wrong, I can read wordy and understand it, but when you are having sex problems, you don't necessarily want to feel like you are reading an encyclopedia or are enrolled in a college class. To me, you want to feel like a close friend is talking to you about a very intimate sensitive subject. I bought a lot of books and this one is NOT one of the ones that helped us. Please see my other reviews for books that actually helped to create a change in our marriage.I would recommend ""The Sex Starved Marriage"" instead of this book if there is one spouse less interested in sex than the other."
3,Okay but not great info,Book is very long winded and while it covers all the bases it does so with a bit more fluff then needed. The whole first half of the book is spent describing the situations in detail which is like describing a car when all you really want to know is how to drive it. As such plodding thru the first half is boring and tedious. And to make matters worse the author continually prompts you not to skip to the next chapter. Thanks but if you knew it was dumb telling me you knew only makes it worse. I will say the middle had some good info and for those reading the book it could help. My advice would be to skip the chapter if it's not working for you and go to what you need.
3,Too small Ghillies,"These shoes are good value for money. However they run very small. The first pair I bought were a half a size larger (6.5) than my normal shoe size (6) but they were still too small. I tried stretching them to no avail. I then bought a second pair and bought a size 7.5 which fit, with a sock on or an insole in, ""comfortable"". I would have given them a better rating if they had fitted true to size."
4,Bought for Renn Fest,"I bought these to wear to our Renaissance festival this year. They look great with my renn garb! They do seem to me a little small. I wear a 9.5 and these were tight in the toes. Also, as these are indoor dance shoes they offer no support and have a very thin sole so you will feel the gravel and every little thing on the ground! All in all I like them, and as they are leather I expect they will stretch the more I wear them."
3,Wished it tasted more like the citrus flavored bottle tea,"I absolutely adore the lipton citrus diet green tea and since they dont make that flavor in a to go package I decided to give this a try. It isnt nearly as good, I can add lemon juice to the raspberry flavored to go tea and it makes it taste better. The artificial flavors tend to stand out and so I dont desire to keep these prepared in the fridge. Its not terrible jut not as good as the citrus."
2,Certainly not the best,"I like all of the Lipton Iced Tea To Go flavors except this one. I suppose there are some who will like this, but I found it had a very unpleasant aftertaste... and didn't really have a taste of raspberries."
3,1st problem ever encountered with a Pro-S,"I bought the 7pc. Pro-S block set. This knife was included in that set. As I was admiring my new tools I was utterly suprised to see what looked like a stain at the bolster of this knife. As I looked closer it was actually a small section of pitted steel. As I was looking at this moderately small spot I noticed a pitted crack approximately 1/2 inch in length extending from that spot down toward the point. At the point another pitted area covering approximately 1/8-1/6 of an inche from the tip down the scalloped side of the blade.Don't get me wrong the Henckels Pro-S is still the best knife you could buy, but I was astounded that quality control missed this defective blade. I thought I would never have to make use of the lifetime warranty (especially 3 days after buying a set). But hopefully the exchange will go just as smooth as these excellent knife cut though food."
5,A must in the kitchen,"We live on our boat, almost full time. Although our galley is about the size of a medium on-land kitchen, the space for cutlery is relatively compact. The Pro-S series, in general is superior to any knife I have ever used. Specifically the 5 inch serrated utility knife is the single most used knife in our collection. For slicing veggies or anythng with a crust there is no equal. For slicing tomatoes it is almost a joke between Liz and I, that we can make one tomato last for a week because we can make the slices so thin and even."
2,"""Forged"" metal in handle broke","I've owned a 5-inch Henkels serrated knife for about a year. The piece of metal that's riveted in the handle broke. I might expect the black synthetic portion of the handle to break, but the ""forged stainless steel""? Pretty disappointing."
5,An Absolute Must for Every Kitchen,"This is the most used knife in our kitchen. I've had two Pro-S 5"" serrated knives for many years now, and the edges still cut razor sharp. That unfortunately applies to fingertips too. Don't daydream when you use these, please! A very well-made, solid knife. If hand-washed/dryed as the manufacturer recommends, they will last a long time. These knives can be found much cheaper on Ebay and elsewhere once in awhile. If you are a cheapskate like me, online-shopping diligence pays off. In return, you will own an excellent utility knife."
5,Disney songs.,This is exactly what i wanted. No scratches its perfect and it came really quickly. There is no complaints on my part.
4,Love it!,This is another hair style book that I enjoyed.pictures are great and its very up-to-date. It helps me get creative with my older daughter's hair. Instructions are easy to follow and the hair accessories section is also helpful. I'd recommend this for anyone that needs help in putting cute hair styles for themselves or any other girls.
4,Pretty Good,I Like This Book Alot It Help Me Do What I Love To Do Hair ! I Think All Girls Hould Have This Book . The Only Thing I Had A PRoblem With Is I Have really Long Hair And Not All The Hair Styles Work On ME But The Ones That Did Where Great !!!!
3,"Small book, nice pictures, for young girls","This book is nice, but smaller than I expected for the price. The pictures are appealing, the styles seem attractive and not too difficult, and it is a good choice for a young girl, perhaps ages 5-9."
5,Good value,"Book was in excellent condition. It was an older book with a different cover and that was not expected. But overall, the book has all of the same information inside. Hopefully my daughter won't mind the cover and enjoy the book. Thank you."
3,"Eh...so, so.",This would be great as a very basic beginner guide to hair care or style ideas. There was very little new information in it for my 10 year old though.
3,Item wasn't new as listed,"Disappointed to buy a book that's listed as new, and when you open it, there are ink marks in it."
4,Cool!,"This book has given my children a couple of new ideas, there are not as many ideas as i had hoped in there, but for the price it is very good"
2,Better books on hair out there...,"I had hopes that this would be a good book for someone such as myself who has very long hair and wants to be able to style my hair in new and interesting ways. This book is not the one for doing so. I know it's listed for girls, but some of the hair styles were very childish. If a teenager was wanting this, and knew nothing about it, they would be very disappointed I'm afraid I cannot recommend this book as being worth while."
2,An o.k. starting point,"I am giving this book two stars because it does have nice photographs and clear explanations of how to achieve each style. It is consistent in that regard with the kind of quality you would expect from American Girl products.However the book provides only the most rudimentary hair styles, even when you consider that this book is geared toward children.If you are purchasing this book for someone over the age of ten years, I suggest Hair: A Book of Braiding and Styles. This title has a better selection of styles, and comes complete with three hair scrunchies."
5,Great book!,My daughter loves me to do her hair in different styles. I have a hard time coming up with new and unique ways to do her hair. After I bought this book it has been a fun experience choosing what her different style is going to be. She even uses it to do her dolls hair.
2,"Long, often annoying.","Only sporadic enjoyable scenes kept me readig until the end. I wondered several times.Sion is a troubled man who overcomes his adversities to emerge fairly heroic -- except sometimes in his relationship with Katherine. I liked their constant battles except when they (mainly Katherine) deliberately hurt each other. Sometimes she was so unlikeable, so unworthy of Sion (strange name, BTW). Her situation before Sion was appalling, but she was so distrustful and rash that she created real problems. Some parts of her side of the story were very good and realisitc, but she became too annoying.In addition, the dialogue and actions were often not in sync with the historical realities. And there was a lot of repetition in Sion & Katherine's relationship. I wouldn't bother, if I were you. There's so much more to choose from."
5,"The Best, hands down.","Being gifted with very straight, blonde lashes, I've found it necessary to curl them so they show up at all. I've used the regular CG curler, various super-cheap brands, and also the Shu Uemura one that is generally accepted as the greatest thing to ever happen to eyelashes. (Don't get me wrong, it really is good.) But this one is better. I loooooove this eyelash curler for it's ease of use, long-lasting curl, softness and best of all, NO EYELID PINCHING.Highly recommended."
3,Not great at cleaning smudges off glasses,"I was expecting better results than I got at cleaning oil (skin) smudges off glasses. I'm new to glasses and haven't quite gotten down the ""don't get fingerprints all over your lenses"" part quite yet...these work nowhere near as well asCables Unlimted ACC-FIBER6 Ultra Absorbent Microfiber Cleaning Cloths (6 Pack)for cleaning my eyeglasses."
2,You get what you paid for,Cheap. Does not hurt my lenses as far as I can tell. But doesn't clean my glasses all that well.
2,Not the old sight savers I remember...,"Ok - so I'm an old gal (53) but I remember when ""Sight Savers"" came in this match-book type pad of eye glass cleaning tissues. They were pretty soft and cleaned glasses like nothing else in this world. It was like they contained dry Windex! These Sight Saver Tissues are NOT like the old tissues. These are hard and I'm almost afraid to use them on my glasses for fear that they will scratch them.The box is about half the size of a large tissue box - and dispense the same way - but these are NOT tissues...they are like soft paper or hard Kleenex....take your pick. It is hard to get them under the nose pieces on eye glasses and that is the area where mine always seem to get smeary.Save your money and buy a small bottle of windex and kleenex."
2,One Use Requires Two Sheets Minimum,"The sheets are quite flimsy and thin, so I have found that I must overlay (2) sheets at a time when cleaning a pair of eyeglasses. I lay the doubled sheets flat and then spray them with cleaning solution. I found that spraying the lenses first caused the sheets to become oversaturated and to disintegrate on contact. Even with this approach, the sheets fall apart quickly. I will probably increase to (3) sheets at a time just to get rid of them more quickly. With careful use, they do leave lenses clean and scratch-free, but I will not be buying them again for cleaning eyeglasses."
4,"Pleasant, fresh, light-weight fantasy; romantic elements.","_Changing Fate_ is an enjoyable fantasy adventure. Elisabeth Waters is not overly ambitious in her world-building, but she doesn't recycle: nary an elf or a unicorn in sight. The main characters are intelligent without being improbably bright. Lack of purple prose and sentimental meanderings make this book more palatable than many other contemporary romantic fantasies. The hero, a young woman hiding her shape-shifting ability, is forced to abandon her ancestral home and undergoes a number of adventures. Most conflicts are solved with mis-direction or flight: there is only one short sword-fight."
5,This is a receiver crystal for RC airplane.,"I sent feedback earlier. I had ordered the wrong crystal... too small to plug in to my receiver, when I sent an email, the company sent the right ones overnight free. They were great to do business with. I later sent the wrong ones back."
3,Patients and healers in the context of culture,"Describes observations of clinical interviews between various medical practitioners, namely folk healers, temple medicine men, and Chinese style and Western style physicians, and their patients. Stresses the importance of adopting proper cultural perspectives, making one's interpretations within that framework, and relying on direct observation. Urges an integration of social and cultural methods into the routine training of doctors, so as to enable a more humane and appropriate clinical practice."
5,Pictures That Leap Off the Page,"Being of Irish American heritage I was interested in the subject already, but the pictures are what persuaded me to actually purchase this book. The subjects, their surroundings, and the colors make every image unique and captivating. This book truly covers the entire spectrum of the Irish in America today. I highly reccommend it."
5,The Heart of the Matter,"A wonderful book. I initially bought a couple copies as Cristmas gifts for family members (the cover girl compelled me.) As I began to read the essays, I was so taken with the stories of these remarkable individuals that I found myself purchasing additional copies - for myself, friends and my local library. The essays bring the lives of average Americans, captains of industry and celebrities into a cohesive focus that is difficult to put down. I love it."
1,Way overpriced for poor quality handles,"Very disappointed after using these for less than a year. The handles on two of these are loose, and several are scratched. They looked great new, but now just look and feel [inexpensive]. Should have been much higher quality for the ridiculous price."
2,What happens to the handles?,"At least I am not alone. There are two other viewers having the same 'sub-standard' handles. The scratch marks and cuts at some of the handles is an eye sore and really makes me wonder whether I am getting a genuine Germany set. One should also examine properly whether the handles attached to the tangs are in equal size. For my Chef knife, one side of mine is 'fatter' than the other. Even though I do not feel the difference in terms of the balancing of the knife, such mistakes should not be allowed.I'm really confused as to why scratch marks are common for a brand new set. Maybe Henckels should should secure the knives, shear and sharpening tool to a box to minimise the likelihood of them coming in contact with each other during transportation."
4,They are OK,"They need to be sharpened right out of the box. Some of them (8"" chef and 10"" chef that I bought separately) have spine sharp enough to cut yourself - I had to have it dulled. Other than that they are OK. If I was buying again I would go with Wusthof.Update: Sharpening steel is your best friend!"
2,Defective,"The chef knife in the set I received has forging defect. The support person kept telling me that Henckels had almost perfect quality control. The knives should not have any defect. But, it did. I had to return the chef knife for replacement. The sufaces for couple other knives were scratched also. after two weeks, I did receive the replacement knife, but it didn't match the original set. I didn't bother to send it back again. Quality: poor. Support person: not knowledgable."
3,Not what I hoped for,"Are Albenizs' works really this complicated, or are these just poorly arranged? I have not officialy played through all of the works contained in this book. But upon listening to the cd and visually following these songs I find myself unimpressed. The arrangements seem really awkward and complicated. This book also contains a solo version of each of these songs. But they are simply the easy versions, and do not offer much in the sound department. I would consider them useless. Also, one of the songs on the cd is not in the same order as the book. But I don't consider that a big problem. Are these some of the best of Albenizs' works? I don't think so. I would look elsewhere for Albeniz transcriptions."
3,Question about Units used (US and Metric?),"HiI do not have a copy of the current edition, but a year ago I investigated purchasing a previous edition. What deterred me at the time was that all tips, tricks and equations etc. were in US units and thus only of very limited appeal to the Metric world.A question to a reviewer of the 4th edition - has the book become ""international"", i.e. quoting metric and US units? If not, it shall remain of limited desirability in the free world.Roland"
3,HAS ANYBODY SEEN THE IMPORT VERSION OF THIS DVD?,"I HAVE THE 2002 DVD AND HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A MOVIE LISTED AS AN 'IMPORT' VERSION. IF ANYBODY OUT THERE CAN TELL ME ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE IMPORT VERSION I SINCERELY REQUEST THAT YOU WRITE A REVIEW. BASICALLY, I WANT TO KNOW IF BOTH VERSIONS ARE VISUALLY SIMILAR."
5,mari wilson is back...and fierce,"being a fan of Mari Wilson's since the days of ""SHOWPEOPLE,"" i have to tell you, she has done it again! this disc is in my car, in my office and in my home, i can not get enough of it. i have purchased other mari wilson disc's in hopes of falling in love again with the woman who gave us the phenomnal :showpeople, with no luck til now. this is a mature, polished mari. Especially ""love at last"" and ""foolproof."" her renditions of todd rundgren's ""i saw the light"" and the beegee's ""how can you mend a broken heart"" are phenomenal.The disc is so good that people at work who have heard some of it have begged me to burn them copies. if the disc were promoted, she could finally have the huge success she deserves"
2,Cheap quality...,"I've had this product about 6 months. It does what it supposed to do as far as being able to hit it without damaging my lawn or floor. However, the pad is too thin, so I had to put extra padding that I was using in my garage. Also, when using irons with the rubber tee, pieces of the mat including grass & backing were starting to chip off making holes. It is literally falling apart. Although the commercial grade is about 2x more than this one, I am spending money again to buy better quality that lasts. It was waste of money for me."
4,High Acalades,"My Soul is a wake up call for those of us who only call upon our spirituality when we are need. With all the narratives in the book, there's something for everyone. The author hits home for those of us who have experienced the death of a close family member, spite from others, or even feeling vengeful. I highly recommend the book to others"
2,The broom handle should be angled,"The broom handle should be angled. I think the handle makes it a little awkward to use as a push broom; it's design is similar to a regular house broom, straight off the center of the broom. Although my grandson still plays with it, I think I might have Grandpa revamp it."
1,Not as advertised,"This broom isn't capable of being pushed because, as the first review stated, it can't be pushed. There is no angle to it. I'm not sure at this point if we'll keep the ones I bought. I had to buy 2 because of twins and am not happy about wasting $24."
1,push??.....not sure how,"I agree with other negative reviews, and regret that we purchased this item. There is no way to use it as a push broom! And I'm not impressed with the cheap plastic bristles. Don't bother with this broom if you want a truly functional broom for your little one (our child is 4). It'll be worth checking around and I recommend forsmallhands.com They have REAL functional tools/items for your growing child. I will be returning this item."
1,Not a push broom,This item is not a push broom as advertised. There is no angle to the head at all. The Schylling Push Broom is excellent. It is very easy to use and my little one loves it. Amazon has it starting at $8.99.
3,Eh...,This item is just ok. The bristles aren't that great. It doesn't feel right when it's being used as if the bristles were bent and it stayed that way in some areas so it isn't pushing the dirt right. It's durable because its' made out of wood. My 16 month old son is more interested in the regular child-sized broom.
3,Basic knives,"These are low-end Henckels, which is fine, if that's what you're after. But don't expect the top quality usually associated with the Henckels name."
4,Great bricks for small hands,"I love these and so does my 2-year old son - so easy for him to stack them up and build towers and buildings. The blocks have fun bright colors and they are very durable. The only downer is the price - $30+ for 13 blocks is a little steep, I wish there were more blocks in the box. But at the same time - they are wooden and non-toxic, so I'd rather pay a bit more and have a piece of mind knowing my son is playing with a safe toy from natural materials, rather than some poisonous plastic. Also, the blocks are NOT made in China, which I appreciate as well."
4,Great - just would like more,"These are great for my 12-month-old who really likes them (and is able to stack them); my only complaint is that you can't build that much with only the 13 pieces and to buy two sets would be a pricey collection of wooden blocks (though I do not regret buying the one set I bought). Also, I do realize that one has to pay more, typically, for toys made in Europe, rather than China."
4,Blocks That Introduce the Idea of Building,"This is a lovely set of wooden blocks that use a Lego-type mechanism to keep them from falling over. The wood is hard wood and the paints seem very durable.I like the colors and my daughter seems to enjoy stacking them as well. The set does not contain many blocks, though, so you cannot go very high. It's almost like a starter set.I think that if I could do it again, I would prefer to buy something without the Lego fit-in pieces, and something with more blocks."
4,What A Voice,"Her voice is soulful, soft, and strong all at once. It's such a great mix, that I'm unsure what genre of music she falls under. I bought the CD for a track entitled, ""My Song""... But all of the songs my song."
1,Make sure you need this - not for car hauler,"Bought this along with Superwinch winch and wiring kit for my boy friend's car trailer. Had shipped quickly as shop said they could install the following week. Two months later they finally installed the winch and said this accessory kit was for getting trucks out of mud, not loading cars in trailers. So I'm stuck with a $170 item to try and sell. May be treat for trucks stuck in mud, but not for car hauler trailers. Did look like really quality products."
5,Classical and...classy,"This reprint of the 1995 edition can be very useful to those who study charting and technical analysis - or just dig in to it. Especially for the British market, you can see it even as a book of the LSE history."
1,Junk,These bits are junk. They broke within five minutes of use and all I was cutting was 5/8 floor plywood. I will never get again!
2,Disappointing code examples,"Looks like I'm going to break the mould of giving five star reviews to this book.Part I is a brief overview of the history and motivation behind Linux. No bones there.Part II covers compiler and related tools. I learnt a few things from these chapters (I wasn't familiar with either autotools or gcov).Part III covers application development. The emphasis is mainly on IPC. There are some grim errors in the code. In particular, I winced when I saw the use of asserts that contained statements performing actions with (necessary!) side-effects. Compiled in optimized mode in most environments, this code will crash. For this section, Stevens/Rago APUE or Rochkind AUP serve much better.Part IV, shell scripts and tools is OK, as is part V, debug/test.I'm not sure why there's a CD included. It contains the source code (of little value, easily downloaded) and all of the diagrams used in the book. I can't imagine that they will ever come in handy."
5,Florshiem Loafer,I currently wear a Bostonian loafer with a leather sole and it wears well. I purchased this Florshiem loafer with a hard sole and it wears great also. The Bostonian is black and the Florshiem is burgandy. They are both a compliment to my activities. They both feel like a dress shoe should feel and they walk like a wingtip.
5,Just what I wanted,"Needed a EEE shoe which is very hard to find. Wanted a penny loafer with a heel, not a rubber sole. These shoes fit great and are just what I was looking for. After spending a day at the mall a salesman told us they don't carry EEE in the store and have to order them. These shoes are nicer than any shoe we found at the mall."
3,Noisy,Fits well to my size. Makes noise on tiled floors. Looking to put something to reduce noise while walking in the office. Otherwise good shoe.
1,Not a good shoe,I wore them for maybe 2 months now and the leather sole is peeling off the shoe itself. Not worth fixing may try self repair but they are 1 step away from the garbage.
2,A Hole in the Sole,"I was looking for a quality loafer at a reasonable price and was happy to find the Florsheim Berkeley Loafer for around $55. I purchased these shoes back in August 2011 and basically wore them 4 to 5 days a week to work. The quality, comfort, and fit were fantastic - 100% Florsheim. And yet the following December, only five months later, I was astonished to find a hole in the left sole, despite the fact I never did any serious walking in them during this time. I suppose I could take them in to be re-soled, but that could easily cost more than half of what I paid for them to begin with."
2,not really good,buy a bass weejuns and it blows this shoe out of the water. but it delivers where advertised. not my kind of shoe.
1,loafer shoe,"I have ordered the size of 9.5 2E, but they've shipped the size of 9.5 2A ( much much narrower than normal width), so that I had to look for a man who can ware that size because the returning cost is very rxpensive too (I have ordered it from Korea)."
3,Come on.......then.......BAM!,"I knew exaclty what I wanted and the exact loafers were advertised at a good price.......but low and behold I put in the size I needed and that ""good price"" went up in smoke. I bought them anyways because I wanted them. I just didn't like being set up for something that was never going to happen. If it's too good to be true.......Honesty is the best policy.Enough said."
1,bad,"Mis zapatos han salido muy bajos de calidad, me sorprende que Florsheim haya bajado su calidad, tengo estos zapatos hace una semana y ya se les esta quitando el color en la parte de arriba del zapato.No estoy a gusto con esta compra.gracias."
1,Poor quality,"Product is of poor qualityPurchased shoes in Dec 2011 and by May 2012, both shoes have holes in solesWill not purchase from seller again"
2,poor quality,I purchased a pair in March 2011 and wore them daily. The sole on the left shoe wore through in December 2011.
2,Wore out too soon,"I've worn this shoe for many years. I usually get 2-3 years out of a pair. This last pair wore through the sole in just over one year. Something changed at Florshiem. Maybe they're using cheaper materials, or skipping some processing step...I don't know. I do know that this pair was of distinctly lower quality compared to the last four pairs of the identical shoe. Just ordered my replacement pair: Bass. Let's hope they're better!"
2,Just Need a Couple of Nuts,Have used two of these for years and they work great. The problem is the slotted plastic nut that holds the unit in place. The nut becomes brittle with age and cold and breaks easily after a couple of years. The mfr needs to beef up that part or sell replacements. Don't want to buy a new unit when a little plastic nut would keep the old one working.
1,"broken when I got it, company will not replace","This has been the most frustrating experience. I ordered a simple heater for the horse water tank. I have the receipt for October 2012. The first time I actually plugged it in was December 2012. It immediately tripped the breaker several times, it never worked. I tried to send it back to the company (at my expense) and they tried to say on the parts list it said 2010 and therefore not under any sort of warrenty. Now they don't return calls. I'm super dissappointed, I paid for a ""new"" devise that never worked and the company won't do the right thing and replace it."
2,Westcoast......,Well it s not so cool !Only 3 tracks swet the groove.....The rest is....... up to you !
1,heats up quickly,"I bought this because it was less expensive. But, it was not worth it and ultimately did not save me anything. The blade heats up very quickly before you've barely cut an inch (causing the safety switch to flip). Wears out quickly, too."
1,"Review is about time cards via Amazon, NOT the games themselves...","Ok, first of all my review and rating is based on this NCSoft Time Card, not the actual games it allows you to play. That said, I don't know if these are no longer made or what but the prices on this card is INSANE!!!!! The games this allows you to play are at most $15 a month. That makes it $30 for 60 days. Therefore, any price higher that $30 (plus shipping of course) is a rip off. The current FEATURED MERCHANT for this product at the time of this review wants $50 for a time card. Go to your local grocery store and buy a PREPAID Visa Debit Card. NCSoft does accept them, and even at a cost of $3-5 dollars to refill it, it's STILL cheaper than ANY of the merchants selling these time cards."
2,Good price but item limit makes it useless,"In regards to this game time card, the price is very good because it's like $10 a month. However I would have rather paid a higher amount of money for this card in exchange for the item purchase limit to be removed. Right now you can only buy this item once. nature of using a game time card is that month after month you need to buy the same game time card again to pay for another month of game time. Being able to buy this item once makes it rather useless because now I have to find another consistent source to buy these.Also in the review, Amazon said how much fun this game is. Dear Amazon, you're not selling a game, you're selling a game time card that needs to be applied every 2 months in order to access the any of the monthly game-time based game that NCSoft supports."
1,NOT for New or Trial accounts,"It is important to note that this card cannot be used to activate an account, a specific Game Card is required for that. It would have been helpful to have been provided this information at the time of purchace. The Game Time Card can only be used to add time to existing games. This is NOT a Game Card for upgrading or Activating a new account."
2,Packaging Issue,"I am not going to evaluate the games this 60-Day online subsgription card applies to. This was for my sons, the game players in the houshold. My problem was with the delivery of this piece.First, I was charged over $7 for shipping which seems odd for something that could fit in a standard envelope. When the package arrived I could see why the shipping was so much. It started with a bubble wrap reinforced envelope. Inside that we found a plastic DVD case, complete with full color printed label, just like what you would buy a movie in. Finally you open the plastic case and find a plastic card (like a credit card) also printed in full color. Finally my boys find what they were looking for, the number they need to type in to the game to update their time. This seems obscene in light of the country's need to cut back on fossil fuels to invest all this plastic into the delivery of a number."
1,No point in buying this card online,"The purpose of these cards is to allow people to pay cash for game time. Since you can't pay with cash on Amazon, that defeats the whole purpose. If you're going to buy game time online use PlayNC, it's the same price or cheaper, and you don't have to wait for delivery (or pay extra to have it sooner). If you don't want to use a credit card go find these card in retail outlets."
5,Lineage II,"60 days of paid time within NCSoft games, what more is there to say? :< Codes worked, came out even cheaper in the end with buying these time cards."
3,overpriced?,"Used it to play CoH/CoV, but ever since these came out, they got rid of the independent cards, for every game. I'm guessing that's why the price went up. No point of ordering it off of Amazon, it goes $30+ WITH a waiting period, not worth it. I rather just go to the site and order monthly for $15 rather than paying more. I think I will wait until Amazon decides to drop the price to $21 again, that was a good deal."
5,Game Card is awesome,Its always a plus to find these cards online rather then not find them in stores now-a-days
5,NCsoft 60-Day Game Time Card,"This time card is a great way to pay for game time for City of Heroes, Auto Assault and other NC Soft games. If you have a monthly subscription, you pay around $15 but you also pay taxes, so it becomes around $17 total. If you shop around, it is possible to buy a 60 day ( 2 month) time card for $25-27 instead of paying $30+taxes for a 2 month subscription."
4,Excellent knife,Excellent ability to cut breads. Only drawback is that it's a bit too long for our knife block. Just double check on the length of your knife block if this concerns you.
5,The best book I've read in a long time!,"This book touched me in so many ways. I saw myself, in some way or another, in each character. The book made me realize how fortunate I am to be Muslim and how important it is to practice Islam all the time, not just when it's convenient for me. I will continue to spread the word about this book to my friends and family."
5,Creative!!,If I Should Speak brings to life Islamic concepts beautifully woven into a captivating novel that makes real the spiritual questions and answers we are all seeking. This is a wonderful book that creatively educates about Islam without being too academic. Umm Zakiyah's novel appeals to any person with spiritual curiosity as well as anyone who enjoys a good read! I highly recommend If I Should Speak to all!
5,The Purpose of Life,"I've never finished a novel as fast as I have finished this one. It is very easily written, perfect for everyone to understand. Young, old, educated and non-educated, just how it should be. Umm Zakiyyah is highly talented and knows exactly how to draw you into the characters, and you can not help but feel their ups and downs like you're going thru it yourself. This is a great book for dawah, and especially those who are struggling to find the purpose of life.This book has left me with gratitude - to be a muslim, hope - that more authors like her will come along, and sadness - that the book actually came to an end. ..... until i heard about part 2! :-)"
5,Better than I expected,"I had heard many great things about this book and was about to assign it for one my students for a summer reading. However, I decided it would be wise it to read it first. I could not put down the book during the two days I read it, I felt it to be very moving and it brought me to tears at one point. I think this is a great read that everyone should try to get their hands on."
2,Interesting but.......,"Well, the book is brilliantly written but I could not deny my feelings of frustration. Aminah was so very concerned about Durrah's destiny that she forgot to even grieve her, why would anyone be concerned about someone's destiny and forget that Allah is the FAIR, Allah has other ways to judge people, Durrah was light hearted, loved by everyone and that's a sign that she is good, so if she happened to be on the wrong path (according to Aminah) that does not mean she will be burnt eternally in hell fire, also Aminah's concerns were not justified, she acted like a judge. I was born Muslim and I am originally from the holy city, Makkah but I think Aminah in the novel was a bit over conservative, judging Durrah by the way she looks and acts and that's not human's job, Allah judges better.Well, maybe the author meant it to be this way for a reason but that's my opinion, I am not even reading the other novel (The Voice)."
2,Boring & not what expected,"This book was too much of a pro islam .... learn islam, become islamitic....not a novel... not what I expected at all... Found it really boring and skimmed lots of pages. Could not not finish it but was happy to be finished!!"
2,Poorly Written,"I do wish Muslims as a whole had enough literature that we wouldn't feel the need to tout a poorly written piece such as this one. The language was terribly stiff. This book didn't feel real at all. Also, the plot was cliched.Come one, Muslim writers, get out there and give us some better fiction than this!"
5,"Good Fun, but needs lots of space","Clear throwing instructions.I was able to make it come back within about an hour of practice.Doesn't quite make it back from the throwing position, it generally lands about 10ft away.Doesn't function to well in strong winds."
4,"Good, but needs a very big space","Its not quite as revolutionary as the original aerobie, but its still a good toy. The original aerobie flies much farther and with less effort than an ordinary frisbee. This is pretty lightweight, and won't hurt too bad if it hits you, but it still takes quite a bit of practice to get it to return (like any boomerang). You'll need a large space to use this because it curves quite a bit, and tends to arc upwared, so if you use it in your yard you will have alot of trips to the roof and up trees.Its a good toy but make sure you have a big space to play with it."
1,They don't come back,"I was disappointed that they didn't come back when I threw them. It was fun to watch the grandkids try and then go running after them, but it's not the way it's supposed to be....I wish they would included written instruction, I have the hardest time looking at pictures and then trying to do what it says."
2,ok sometimes,It worked a couple times. most of the times it would just roll on the ground. It was exciting when we got it to work!
2,Hard to throw,For a fool proof product - it sure is hard to throw right. I've followed the instructions and tried and tried.
2,Doesn't return fully,"This boomerang doesn't fly all the way back. It goes out, turns, and then loses momentum and falls to the ground. So far I've made numerous attempts, and it nevery came all the way back - not even close."
2,Disappointing,"The first time I leafed through this book at a bookstore, I found an error, and it was downhill from there. The most frustrating part is that many of the references cited in the text don't appear in the bibliography. So there's no way to go to the source to learn more about the topic the authors are discussing. You'd think a problem like this would be fixed by the third edition! This book is required reading for becoming a certified interpreter in the USA, so it's really disappointing that it was not more rigorously reviewed and edited."
5,Wonderful steak knives,These are wonderful knives. They cut the meat as easily as a case knife going through butter. I am very happy with this product and plan to purchase more.
1,So disappointed in Henckels,"I have owned and enjoyed and recommended Henckels knives for years; naturally, when I needed high quality steak knives, I went to them first. I have owned this set for less than 6 months. Tonight while merely cutting a pork chop, the blade that I was using snapped right through the steel, near the handle. There was no unusual force being applied; just an ordinary cut through tender meat.I have had this happen with lesser knives, but never expected it with this set. I had read a review speaking of this problem at the time I ordered my steak knives but decided to disregard it and go with my experience. I hope you will listen and not waste your hard earned money."
1,Another broken knife,"I have owned 4 Henckel 4-star steak knives for more than 15 yrs. They work great. I take care of them by keeping them in a block, hand washing, and giving periodic professional sharpenings, but I dont baby them and they have fallen to the floor many times.Thought I would add knives to my set and ignored those broken knife stories. Well, as I pulled the first new knife out of the box, it slipped, fell to the counter, and the blade snapped in two!!The new knives have a slightly thinner and narrower blade than my old knives. The blades are also a bit more flexible and dont feel as sturdy or capable cutting meat. They would be better than a butter knife and the price seems good but I dont want the hassle of replacing them repeatedly.I have a bunch of Henckel knives and a ton of brand loyalty, but I'm shopping other brands now.Kevin"
5,Expensive but awesome!,"I bought this set of steak knives to go with a matching set of JA Henckels Twin Pro knives. They're definitely a bit pricey, but their quality and feel are phenomenal, and they perfectly match the set. These knives will last well beyond my lifetime!"
4,Small but mighty,This vacuum is smaller than I expected but does great for my laminated floors and getting the pet hair. I have 3 pugs that shed horrendously and this does more than a regular vacuum that I paid twice of much for. My only complaint is since it's small it tends to be top heavy and will tip over when pulling it over a small lip of flooring between rooms.
5,Shop Vac,Recieved my shop vac well before estimated delivery date and is everything I expected. This compact shop vac is ideal for doing stairs as that is what I purchased it for. I originally was looking at hand held vacs for doing the stairs but as I was researching them I stumbled upon this powerfull compact shop vac and really happy I did. This shop vac has 3 times the power of a hand held as I have owned a hand held Dirt Devil for years. With this unit you recieve much more cleaning power for the money. I highly reccomend this powerfull compact vac !Shopping with Amazon.com is my first stop while shopping online !
1,POOR design,"The manufacturer ships this vacuum in a way that requires some minor assembly; the wheels and their plastic support need to be attached to the canister. Simple enough, except the wheels require that you ""push and twist"" in order for them to seat properly. I was unable to get even one wheel to attach as described in the instructions; the wheel actually broke during assembly.Why can't the manufacturer ship a product like this without any additional assembly?I read reviews indicating others had the same problem; I should have taken their advice and found something else. Good luck if you buy this one!"
2,"Very convenient to use, but unreliable.","Overall, we love this vacuum, but it's a consumable, disposable item. Our second one has died twice and now in need of a new switch. We have a third new one in the box awaiting it's turn. If you use it regularly, you can count on the switch going bad within a year or two. ShopVac Corp will not sell you a switch; they will only sell you the whole power head for $60. Well um, that's more than we paid for the vacuum.Hang on to your receipt and warranty information as you will likely need it."
3,Small Flaws Limit Stars,"We bought this for a long driving trip, and found that the car charger was not really long enough to power the unit while it is attached to the back of the front seat. We drive a Subaru Outback, so minivans and larger SUV's seem likely to have such problems. In addition, the plug often came out of the cigarette lighter.We have also found the unit tempermental in which discs it plays - it doesn't want to play the Lion King, for example, only the previews!"
4,Great Player But Could've Been Better,"Pros: The 7 inch screen looks clear, bright and good contrast.It's small and compact.Great battery life (sufficient for a 3 hour plane ride).Good price for a screen this size.Reliable brandname.Cons: No inputs (Amazon states incorrectly that it does) so you can't hook up a Playstation or Xbox or other external device.When the power is off, no memory on where you left off (a feature other players have).Speakers not great but this is the norm for portable DVD players and I expected that. My kids and I mostly use headphones anyway and that was plenty loud and clear enough on a noisy airplane.Does not come with a carry on bag.Conclusion: I still give it 4 stars due to the price, screen size and quality and being a reputable brand compared to some others out there."
4,Great DVD player. But NO AV Inputs!,"First I'd like to agree with the other reviews and say that this is a great player for the price, it has a wonderful screen, and battery life seems good as well.Now the bad part... Amazon incorrectly states that it has AV and S-Video INPUTS. it does NOT. You cannot plug in another AV device such as a playstation or VCR, or video camera, etc. The AV and S-Video jacks are OUTPUT only (i.e. for another TV, stereo, etc.)Overall a great player at a great price."
1,Nice player.. For the first 100 hours..,If you plan on using this player for only a short period of time then maybe this is the player for you. If you plan on using it for more then 80-100 hours then I recommend something else. I have had two of these players and neither one lasted more then 3 months. I am currently fighting Toshiba to get anything else but this play for credit.Please look online for the problems be have had with this player. If I had done that before I would not have bought it.Good Luck.
4,A Really Nice DVD Player`,"I received this Toshiba Portable DVD Player as a Christmas gift from my wife. In a word: Wow! This player rocks and it's stacked with features. I like the remote control. Very cool! The best thing about this Toshiba DVD player is the screen image quality. Crisp and clear. It's also small and lightweight making it very easy to travel with. I like the dual headphone jacks. I get great sound quality when listening from my headphones. Yes, the built-in speakers don't put out the greatest sound but there's a remedy for that: Just connect a pair of external speakers to one of the headphone jacks and Presto! you have decent surround sound. Harman/Kardon speakers are my preferred choice. The only little draw back to this player is that I like to keep a spare battery available as a back up. Other than that, this is a nice player for anyone to have and enjoy. Toshiba has made a fan out of me."
1,Brand name that did not live up,"I bought this prtable DVD player and had to exchange it shortly afterwards because I thought I got a defective player. This turned out not to be the case. The second player also had the same problems.*****This player frequently will not play DVDs. Usually I have to start the player 5+ times before it will read the disc. Even if it reads the disc it may either skip the first scenes or freeze midway through the movie. Forget about trying to access the menu. Any options other than play movie, tends to freeze the screen. Friends and family have other portable players from other brands and do not have this problem.I find this Toshiba player virtually unusable."
2,"Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for","I was swayed by the cheap price, but regretted it soon after. The player is bulky, unattractive, has cheap membrane buttons, worst of all, was skipping frequently or would not load some of my DVDs altogether. On top of it, the flimsy plastic notch intended to keep the battery attached broke off after a while. I've now bought a more expensive Panasonic LS50, which is smaller, better built, and so far has worked out great."
2,Do not Buy,"I was excited to get a brand name DVD player at such a reasonable price (275). I have several other Toshiba products in my household and they work flawlesly. Not the case for this DVD player. It worked fairly well for the first year with MINIMAL useage, but in the second year it started to fail / would not play discs that worked fine in every other player in the house. Eventually, it just stopped reading discs all together. I did not get 2 years out of the 1400 despite minimal useage. Another review summed it up perfectly - expect a year or two and about 75 hours of playing time before the unit fails. This is especially awful when the player fails as you're flying or driving with a small child who doesn't understand - ""the player is broke"". Toshiba has scared me off from buying their DVD players. I'll try my luck with a SONY or PANASONIC."
2,"Disappointing, I returned it","In the store I compared this to the 7"" Polaroid PDV-0700. The screen on the Polaroid can be seen easily from any angle, not so for the Toshiba, which looks black from an angle. But the Polaroid was not in stock, so I bought the Toshiba. At home I put in a DVD and discovered that the spinning of the motor is very loud. It is masked if you turn the volume up loud, but it is far noisier that an Initial DVD player that I also tried out. Based on that alone, I returned it."
3,Nothing new here,"Bollier does a credible hob outlining the issues surrounding the theft of the public commons. Many of the issues he highlights are unbelievable. Just thinking about how much of the public commons are being given away is truly astounding (the mining act of 1872 is one example that has always bugged me. A pretty good deal to lock up mineral rights for a few dollars an acre.)However, Bollier comes up short in his recommendations. He outlines a few suggestions as to how to stop the ""silent theft"", however, many of his ideas will require a quantum change in how business operates. There is no way Congress will agree to any of them. I would loved to have seen him address how to jump that obstacle."
5,dont leave this out of your cd stack..,"If your into lil' keke. pick this album up. ""The Throwest"" is one reason to pick up this album. ""ay yo"" feat. drama is a club bouncer.. ""slow down"" is a tight, slow jam, letin your women know that all you want is her. Lil' o: Da fat rat wit da cheeze is one album to not let pass by. pick it up... peace out"
4,"The story of that magical film ""The Red Shoes""",Unfortunately lacking in photographs (that's why I onlygave it 8/10) but a marvellous story of a film thatmade thousands of little girls want to be ballet dancers.
5,A Fine Match,"It was indeed a fine match that paired Morris/Moishe/Moniek Goldner, a man with a compelling story to be told, with Larry Stillman, a man who can really tell a story. I have read many books and stories on the Holocaust and its survivors, many by the most celebrated authors in the world. This book compares favorably to the best of them by the best and most famous of these authors.Everything about Morris is amazing and told with clarity and great style by Mr. Stillman. It is the kind of book you will stay up all night in order to finish. He has clearly done his research carefully to give a flow and continuity to what must have been somewhat disjointed and random series of incidents remembered by Mr. Goldner.Buy this book for yourself and enjoy the pleasure of sharing it with your dearest friends."
4,"Fast-paced, dramatic and true story!","This book by author Larry Stillman is not only well-written but an intriquing story about two men who stay together trying to survive during WWII in Poland. They are very much opposite personalities but overtime learn from each other as they try to survive being hunted by Nazis. The main character, Moishe Goldner is only 5 feet tall but gains stamina as he learns to fight for his life. He loses all his family during an arrest by the Nazis and finds his father later on only to have him shot and killed at the railroad station during his presence. Jan Kopeck the other character is a gonav (thief) and always has been. He saves Goldner's life and helps him survive by teaching him skills in thievery and sharing weapons with him. Together they go on missions to destroy German trains and various weapon storage locations.If you are interested in this time period you will enjoy this book. I did."
4,Evokes Memories,"This book touched me in a special way as a mother. It reminded me that the memories we give children are the humorous, touching and sometimes quiet moments spent together. It is not the extravagent vacation. It is the tummy tickle. Although the author did switch the voice of Via from a very young girl to a mature girl, it was a worthwhile reading experience."
4,Good first novel by another Minot full of potential,"Brava to Eliza Minot. When I first heard Susan Minot's sister was publishing a novel with a storyline/characters similar to MONKEYS, I groaned. But I was quite pleasantly surprised by THE TINY ONE. I found it to be very evocative of childhood and ultimately very moving. I am looking forward to her second novel."
5,Laughter and Tears,"I read this book in five hours. There was no way, once I got started, that I could put it down. I liked Via on page one and by the end I was in love! I wanted to hold her head to my chest and assure her everything was going to be all right - eventually. I though at times her perceptions and vocabulary were too advanced for an eight-year-old, but it didn't stop me from wanting to read more about this precocious child. I found myself laughing outloud and ending the book with tears streaming down my face. I will wait for Ms. Minot's next book with the same expectation I have for the next Elizabeth Berg, Anne Tyler and Alice Hoffman. Oprah should pick this book!"
2,"sometimes sweet, mostly annoying","This book gave me a headache at first, but I kept plowing through and was eventually rewarded by some very sweet, realistic scenes of childhood. The author definitely knows how children think. What small rewards I began to reap from this story however were totally undermined by the appalling ending. The stream of consciousness in third person at the end is such an amateur effort at a sophisticated technique. Very few people can do stream-of-consciousness, and this writer is clearly not one of them. Her ending tried to sound transcendental and impressionistic, but ended up being clumsy and embarrassing. An editor could have saved the integrity of Via's tale."
2,Comments made about this book made it sound wonderful.,"I was really looking forward to reading the book, but I have to say, though, that I did not particularly enjoy it. I was, in fact, very disappointed in the story and the way that it was written. For me, one of the problems with the story is that it seemed so hard to follow. One of the things that I found irritating was an over-abundance of going back and forth between what was suppose to be the past and the present, with little or no easy transition between the two. Even given the fact that the story was told from the view-point of a child, this just did not work for me."
3,Read the whole book,"Minot jumps back and forth so much between the day Via's mum died and memories of the past that I found it hard to follow at first. After I was about a quarter of the way through the book, I felt like I could follow the rhythm better and began to really enjoy the detailed descriptions of Via's school day and thoughts. It reminded me of all the good, naive memories of my childhood."
2,Metaphor Overkill!,"I liked the book but found that there were way too many metaphors and many of them were very distracting because they didn't really work. For example,""the white cloth looks smooth and cool like a milk shake tastes."" Who looks at a white cloth and thinks of a milk shake? If Via Revere spent her childhood thinking of as many metaphors as she did, she'd have had no time to just be a kid. I also felt that Via's voice was too young and immature for a fourth grade girl. Many of the metaphors seemed too sophisticated while a lot of the language seemed too young. I felt that many things were mentioned (ie.the pencil sharpener line or the Brady Bunch) just so the writer could indulge herself in her childhood. But as the reader, I didn't see how many of these details were significant to the story. The ""memories"" would make better conversation than prose."
4,Little sister of Susan Minot scores,"The perfect Catholic family with tons of children and doting parents is torn asunder when Mum is killed in a traffic addicent. This story is told in first person entirely in the child's voice by Eliza Minot, the babe of the family. Touching and poignent, funny and sad, the only negative is that the imagery and language sometimes pulls us out of the child's range of possibilities.A promising new voice from the talented Minot family."
3,Slighly uneven,"As the mother of a child the same age as the protagonist, I felt that Minot's characterization was off. Via Revere's consciousness is much more like that of a 4 or [...]. The child's perception of her mother rang true, but in other parts of the book, Via's observations and experiences seemed too cloudy and hazy for a child of 8. This book has some stunning passages, where the physical details of childhood are drawn in ways that make the reader pause with recognition and remembrance. But these gems surface intermittently in a book that is, overall, less than convincing."
3,Great research but lacks an alternative,"I was decided to remove my mercury fillings, but given that it is something very expensive and painful, I wanted to get as much information as possible. That's why I bought the book. It is obvious that the research shown in it is fantastic, but at the end, it says that any other materials you may place instead, are also dangerous, such as these white plastic-like fillings that I was thinking of. The way it's explained makes you think that you can only replace your fillings with a very specialized dentist like him, otherwise things may get even much worse. In fact, most dentists don't know a word about these Dr.Huggins' methods, so you feel completely insecure. I already visited many dentists asking for these methods, with a very ""Is this guy nuts?"" basic answer."
5,"Opened My Eyes, Changed My Life","I can't say enough about what this book has done for me. In a thought, it convinced me and my business partner to have our silver (mercury-based) fillings removed and this changed the quality of both of our lives immediately and more dramatically than I could have imagined. The book is well-written, thorough, fast-paced and easy to read. This book is a must for anyone who has silver fillings."
4,A must have for any Int'l SW Developer/Tester,"Nadine Kano also recommends the book ""SW Internationalization and Localization"" by Uren, Howard, Perinotti."
1,Henckels 16-Slot Knife Case with Lock,"I have owned my knife case for a couple of months now and I would never recomend this case to anyone. In the time that I have owned it, the case has lost a latch to open it, the stitching holding the case together is coming apart, the webbing holding the knives down is loose, allowing the knives to rub one another, and the devider seperating the kniives hase ripped. I am currently looking for a replacement for it."
2,Henckels Knife Case,"When I first received this case, I was floored with how professional it looks, and how well it cleans up with the synthetic leather. The problem is, while I was going to culinary classes and taking the case in and out of my locker, the knives would fall out because the elastic in the pockets don't hold well enough! This would be fine if the sides zipped shut or otherwise secured completely. This is unfortunately just a glorified knife roll with cardboard reinforced sides. And another thing, I've only had this for about 11 months, and the handle is already ripping out.The childproof locks ARE a plus, though."
1,"Don't buy, does not keep knives secure","This is perfect for protecting your knives when left stationary in your house...But if you finally decide to travel with it, as I just have, you'll lose some knives, unless they fit all the way into the mesh (meaning, if the knife is just a small paring knife). My regularly sized 6 in and 8 in chef knives fall out constantly, with very minimal shaking.There have got to be better knife rolls out there."
1,Garbage,This was a total waste of time and money. The locks are pointless and difficult to operate especially if you are on the line and need to prep on the fly. Also the roll has no sides so things can fall out or people can simply reach in and grab things so locks as a security feature is pretty retarded.
1,Henckles should be ashamed,This case is worth all of 10 dollars of chinese made junk.with a name like Henckels I expected a better made item.total disapointment.
5,SAFETY FIRST!!! at Home,"I stored all my sharp knives in this knife case, in fact, I have three cases stored safely in my higher kitchen cabinet. If you have kids at home, you wanna keep all you sharp knives away from them. There's no other way safer and neater in storing your knives. I also liked its portability. I bring a set of knives when visiting a friend for a cook-out dinner or lunch. It's a great way to show your ""pro"" like way of handling knives. This is a must for any household with kids."
5,Knife purchase,Very nifty. A gift I bought for my brother in law who is a chef. He was very impressed with his gift.
2,Decent,"My hubby got one of these and can't stand it. It's large and bulky. The case it's self is very heavy. It does have a very professional layout and lots of space, but is very difficult to lock when full."
4,Handy and sturdy,"Nice kit. Plenty of room, flexible spaces.Only have one issue with this case:The ""Locks"" are pointless. No key? I wish I'd gone with velcro closures. The little metal buttons are impossible to operate with wet or otherwise messy digits.I'm a personal chef, so I carry blades all the time. This kit is great."
3,Henckles Knife Bag,"Wonderful Bag, great price. Too small, however, for my present needs. I should have looked closer at the pictures."
5,GREAT KITCHEN SHEARS,THESE SHEARS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I EXPECTED OF THEM. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.
5,You will get your money's worth.,"I am finally replacing a Henckels kitchen shears I purchased 12 years ago. Let's see if this one will last another 12 years. I use it for cutting chicken breast bones and fresh herbs, while my kids use it to cut their pizzas into smaller slices. I want to add that the new pair was very stiff to use and the metal piece in the handle for cracking things came off in the dishwasher. I called customer service, and they replaced it with a new one after I returned it to them."
5,A Must Have In Anyone's Kitchen,"I can't function in the kitchen without these shears. A bargain at any price. I bought a knife block set at Target nine years ago and they were part of the set.I will soon be replacing my original pair. Why? Not because they failed me. When used on only the types of items they are indicated for they will probably last forever and perform famously. However, ladies, don't allow your husband to use them to cut speaker wire. I know from experience they will never be the same afterwards!"
2,"Good Name, Poor Design",Other than the Henckels warranty I can't really find any feature of these shears that make them suitable for use in the kitchen. Here's what I disliked: Handles are too short in relation to the blade length to generate enough leverage for tougher items. Inexpensive stamped-steel blades require frequent sharpening. Fixed screw doesn't allow blades to come apart for cleaning allowing food and germs to build up in the screw area. Micro-serrations too small to hold slipery items during cutting. Blades won't cut fully to the point for precision cutting / trimming of delicate items. Still haven't found better than my Wurstof 5550 scissors but was looking for something a little more comfortable on the hands.
5,Great Shears,"I use these shears as an all purpose cutting tool. In addition to minimal cooking tasks, I use them for opening packages and other miscellaneous cutting jobs as they arise around the house. They remain sharp and are very well balanced. I am very pleased with the quality and pricing."
2,"Ok, but.....","I don't think it was worth the money. Very disappointed actually, since it is supposed to made in Germany. I have a couple of scissors like this one from the Dollar Store and they are just as good. Still using them after 2+ years. Don't think I'll buy Henckels products in the future."
5,Awesome!,"I own a set of Henckels knives which I got started on while working in a professional kitchen. Henckels makes the best knives around, hands down, so I trusted the brand.All I can say is I got what I paid for this time. These are true to their maker, they're strong, solid feeling, *very* sharp. So far I've used them to cut a cable tie (for a speaker wiring project...) with ease. They've cut through the rib bones on a chicken breast like nothing. I've also used them on some of that plastic packaging that you practically need a plasma torch to cut open. They've easily done everything I've asked and haven't given me a minutes trouble."
3,Great Tool,Great choice for a kitchen/home companion tool. Great edge and great action. I would buy one again in a minute.
5,Outstanding quality,"We've had many at our home, from the cheap to the most expensive so called ""professional"", and this one beats them all in quality, ease of cleaning, and most importantly, does the job faster and easier on your hands than anything else. We wish we came accross these shears sooner. Also, gave it as a present to all dear to us."
3,Beware of Plastic Handled Shears,I purchased these on the strength of the Henckles name. That was a mistake. The construction does not lend itself to heavy use and over time the blades do not meet with the precison necessary to create clean edged cuts. Anyone who uses shears with uncooked ingredients knows that this is unacceptable. I am going to look for a good pair of all stainless steel commercial style shears.
4,Inexpensive Digital camera,Bought for my dad. easy to use for those that don't need more features. perfect for his needs and canon makes great products
1,Dazed and Confused over MAJOR editorial mistake,"I read astrology guides for entertainment daily. Who ever edited this book needs to go back and look at the dates. Starting on May 1st 1999, the last correct date in the book is Friday April 30, 1999. May 1st 1999 is listed as Monday. For the rest of the book the days of the week do not match the actual dates. If I had noticed this sooner I would have sent the book back. I checked a local book store and they have the same mistake in other Sidney Omarr Astrological Guides. The specific book that I am mentioning is the Sydney Omarr's Cancer 1999: Day-By-Day Astrological Guide for June 21- July 22.With this book you are not getting 18 months of daily guides you are only getting 9 months. I wish there was some way to get my money back. It's not the money it's the principal."
5,Sweet and excellent performance,"I have many recordings of the Dvorak cello concerto. This is the one the I always come back to. It's beautifully played, and I especially enjoy the sweetness of the second movement. It really ""sings""!"
1,omg ... ROTFLOL,"This takes the genre of ""comedy"" to a whole other level ... wrap it up and give it as a gag gift at office parties"
3,Unusual Kids Movie with no Children in the Story,"It is unusual to see a kid's movie with no children in the movie, but this is one such movie. At least, either it is intended for children or for extremely juvenile adults who like talking dogs! It also uses just about every subplot used in children's movies, except for orphans. I guess the dogs take the place of orphans. That said, it does try to give lots of good little lessons in ethics or morality, or just sage advice for life that children should learn. I gave it an average rating because I thought the ending was quite corny. This is one movie kids can mostly safely watch (there are a few swear words used), and I think most kids would like it; however, it is not worth seeking out to see it. If you find it in the Wal-Mart movie 'dump bin' or for rent, if you want something kids can watch, get it and let them see it. Parents can point out the many 'lessons of life' as they notice them in the movie."
1,Most ridiculous movie we've ever seen,"My children (ages 12, 9, and 6), my parents, and I watched this movie today and were all extremely disappointed. The story started out okay, but by the end of the movie we were all wondering why we wasted our time on something so ridiculously stupid. The acting left a lot to be desired. Also, it was extremely obvious almost all the time that the dog was looking at its trainer. The least they could have done was position the trainer behind the actor to make it look like it was actually paying attention to the character (like they did in Lassie). We also agree with the kid's review that the ending was very dumb. When we got to that part, we were all commenting on how we were disappointed that we had wasted 95 minutes of time for the movie to end the way it did. It was unbelievable and, as I've said before, ridiculous. Don't waste your money on this movie. I wouldn't even recommend you rent it."
2,Ridiculous Story but some redeeming qualities,Story goes from great to ridiculous. The core of the story started great with a young man turned from bad to good through the help of good people. They should have kept it that way. How they ended the story was ridiculous. STOP READING if you don't want to know the ending.CGI groom?? and CGI groom turned real for a brief moment? There are just too many silly/unrealistic parts that made this movie horrible. The movie should have ended when the dog graduation was over. Wedding part was unnecessary. The only redeeming quality is the acting from the leading actress and Maxwell Caufield. The leading actress reminded me of Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba. It's good to see Maxwell back. 1 Star for story. 2 stars for good acting from these 2 actors.
1,"biggest waste of my life, actually tortous","omg i don't even know where to begin just plane awful men coming alive from projectors, just awful"
5,My Second Set of these Knives,"I ordered a set of these knives more than a year ago when they were offered for less than $30. We use them daily, they remain extremely sharp, look and feel wonderful, and are a pleasure to use. I have been washing them regularly in the dishwasher and have not noticed any damage or discoloration to them. I wanted to buy a second set but they were always approx. $50-$60. Finally, they were recently on sale for less than $25 so I did buy that second set. They would have been worth the full price, but I sure love a bargain. I will be watching for the next sale so I can give some as presents."
3,Sharp Knives - decent quality - insubstantial,"These are nice knives, but they do not have a luxury feel and they are a bit lightweight. If you are familiar with the upper end Henckels kitchen knives, don't expect the same level of quality. I purchased 8 of these, but I intend to replace them with something a bit more upscale."
5,Great purchase,"Purchased 8 steak knives to complete set as Christmas gift for my daughter. She was very pleased, as was I."
5,Terriffic buy for this quality.,"Because there were only 4, not six, steak knifes, I got all four for less than $30 compared to over $100 for a set of 6 in the box...ilive alone so 4 was just the right number."
3,no longer made in the fatherland but ok anyway,"Half the price of the same knives at Macys wedding greed listing thus allowing me to purchase another item and look like the generous uncle I am actually not. Made offshore NOT in Germany but who cares, its just fine."
4,Great Knives,"Good looking well constructed, high quality, edge keeping, clean slicing, sharp bladed inexpensive steak knives. i recommend, i would buy again."
4,Made a lovely gift!,"My friend wanted to improve her knife collection so when she settled into a new home this set made the perfect housewarming gift! Granted I bought 'the name,' but she seemed pleased & started using them right away. The shopping experience was a painless one, and the shipping was fast."
2,Poorly Written,"I found the writing of this book to be some of the worst I have ever read in a tourbook. I found the writing quality varied greatly by section. If I recall correctly, this book has approximately ten writers and each covered a particular aspect of London. Certain passages simply didn't make any sense. The book had little continuity and therefore was very difficult to ""digest."" Although, the book stated that its authors tried to remain objective, the authors wrote glowingly about virtually every aspect of the city and therefore it was very difficult to determine what was worthwhile and what was not. I wish that the book has made more suggestions and tips. It had some useful maps, but I am sure there would be other sources for this information. This book simply didn't compare to many other guidebooks that I have referenced for trips to other destinations."
1,a dissappointment,"This shaver was a big dissappointment to me. Oh, the shaver itself worked decently enough, although it wasn't a particularly close shave. The biggest dissappointment was the self-cleaning station. It either stopped working early, or it never worked. I would take the shaver out after a full cycle and nothing happened. It was just as dirty as before. I ended up manually cleaning the shaver and in the process eventually destroyed the outer foil. Since I was using shaving gel, the inner workings looked as if they were encased in concrete. When I tried to go to the Panasonic website to buy a replacement foil, I couldn't find any listed for this shaver. When I e-mailed Panasonic to ask them, they told me the regular customer service e-mail address couldn't help me, and gave me a different address. I'm waiting to hear from them.Take home message: DON'T count on the self-cleaning unit, and be VERY, VERY careful manually cleaning the shaver."
2,Good but not great ...,"Interesting and unique with a couple of tracks that are definitely ""keepers"" ... overall, it doesn't disappoint if you are into this type of music but it doesn't really cover any new ground or stand out among other CDs of it's genre ... it weaves memorable Christmas melodies in and out of it's mainly new age tapestry ... it won't be a frequent seaonal spinner for me, but if you like Brule's other titles you should not be disappointed with this one ...- Scriptor"
4,"6"" Henckel Chef Knife","This Henckels Chef Knife is the perfect size to use for just about anything you do in the kitchen. It is a wonderful starter piece to the Henckels collection of knives.I never have to work with a dull knife again, this Chef's knife keeps a sharp blade longer than any of the other brands I have used, and it is not a difficult process to sharpen and maintain it, as well.This knife has always been known for the highest quality of knives, this price is a steal."
4,Henckels 6-Inch Stainless Steel Knief,"So far, we are very happy with the knife and will probably order the larger version."
3,The Handle Broke!!!,"I just loved this knife - I have a small hand, and this one fits perfectly - I always clean all my knives by hand, and so was surprised the last time I used the knife to see the handle had a huge crack in it (by the first rivet. The knife is only two years old, so I'm disappointed. I got it on sale - and didn't save the receipt... maybe I can get it replaced if I write directly to J.A. Henkels International. Anyone with any suggestions on how to get this knife repaired????"
4,The value of a knife,"This is a wonderful knife for the average guy. It cannot match the superior quality of the more expensive Henckles but you get a big bang for the buck. It is sharp and well balanced. This one is produced in Spain. If you want the best, look to spend much more. If you are on a budget DO NOT settle for the cheaper brand of knives, this is a far better investment.(Love You Sue)"
4,"Finally, and affordable glider","I'm giving this 4 stars with a warning- if you want a rocker that will last for years, this probably isn't for you. It's very light weight (I'm 8 months pregnant and have no trouble picking it up), and made a cracking noise when my husband leaned back in it. I'm reserving final judgment for after I've used it for a month or so, but you really can't beat the price. I've looked high and low, and for a glider with removable pads, an ottoman, and the ability to tilt back a little so you can sleep, and this is one of a kind. I sat in it for an hour last night and hated to get up. I got mine for $20 off so it was only $79! Since that's less than half of the next lowest price I've seen, I'm being realistic about how long this will last me."
2,squeaky cushions,"After having this glider for only about 2 months, the cushions started to squeak when I rock. Its not the cushion rubbing on the chair, but the stuffing inside the cushion that squeaks, so there is no way to fix it. I probably bothers me more than my baby, but at night when I'm trying to be really quiet getting him back to sleep, the squeak is annoying."
4,Great glider for the price!,"I was hesitant to spend a lot of money on a glider/ottoman, and was thrilled to find this one for $99. It is plenty comfortable, sturdy, and easy to put together. I wish the denim fabric was a little softer, but I would not let that stop me from purchasing this economical model."
1,Cheap and Terrible Quality,"Save your money for a higher quality glider!!! The quality is horrible. Not only did the seat cushion have a huge black oily stain on it, it has two holes straight through the fabric. There are several places in which the fabric seems are not even sewn together and the stuffing is exposed! The frame of the chair does not align properly and is cracked in several places. How this glider passed inspection is mind boggling! Additionally, the item cannot be returned to the store, you have to mail it to the factory for repair/replacement. Shipping costs more than the glider is worth! If I had it to do over, I'd put my money toward a more expensive model."
1,you get what you pay for,After using this chair for 10 months it is falling apart!The pad is also very poor quality I wish I would have spent the extre money to get a better chair. Beware before you buy this chair is not durable and will probably not last beyond the first year.
4,Easy to recover,Very comfy - save your money and buy this one and have it recovered or do it yourself like I did!
3,Excited to find but soon disappointed,"I was excited to find a rocker and ottoman that was such a good deal! We got it home and took it out of the box. A main support bar was already completely broken! We were so disappointed and now we have to go through finding the replacement part before we can even use it. I was told that you get what you pay for--I guess I wanted to see for myself. Once it is fixed I think it will be a great addition to the nursery, but broken parts are definitely a hassle for anyone, especially a new mom!"
5,Great Accounting,"My Father-In Law, Vernon D. Tomlinson, was the Radio Operator on the first B-17C, (40-2049) ""Skipper"", to arrive at Honolulu on the morning of December 7, 1941. We had many conversations about that experience before his death in 2006. Reading ""Fortress Against the Sun"" substaniated the information that he gave me to record for his family. ""Fortress Against the Sun"" also gave me a lot more information about the first WW-II Action of the B-17 Aircraft in the Pacific. Eric Salecker accomplished a very detailed book that gives a remarkable accounting. The use of the Vets brought realism to his work and makes the book a piece of captured history that should be read by those interested a timeline."
3,"Competent follow-up to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""","Marilyn Burns again teams with Tobe Hooper in his follow-up to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" This time the setting is a isolated motel in the Louisiana bayou, run by yet another group of strange characters. With a swamp full of famished crocodiles, one can only guess what happens to a lot of the guests. Sheriff Stuart Whitman is about to find out. This overlooked Hooper shocker is worth a second look. Like ""Texas"", it gets sweat-inducing with a lot of screaming. Also stars Neville Brand, Mel Ferrer, and Carolyn Jones. Horror fans note: Robert Englund appears as a sleazy john, as does Kyle Richards, who played ""Lindsay"" in ""Halloween"" two years later. William Finley, who later had a small role in Hooper's ""The Funhouse"", plays a hapless motel guest here. Marilyn Burns can still scream."
5,Terrific Sunshades,We purchased 3 of these - one for each of our vehicles. They all fit perfectly & they do lower the cars interior temp! Good buy!
4,Great Things come in Small Packages!,"From the moment I layed eyes on this lil' magical book I was enchanted. This wonderful spell book is an easy yet enjoyable read. Including insights on witchcraft, spells, recipes,herbs and more. The real enjoyment comes not only from the information contained within, but it also tantalizes your senses of touch and feel. A Soft/Hard back book with incredible paper, illustrations and a ribbon tie. There are 6 total books in the series and everyone is well worth it. I find myself just walking by the bookcase and having to pick it up just so I can undo the ribbon and flip through the pages... The recipes are great the spells well versed. The only drawback is it leaves you wanting more... I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. CW"
2,Not worth the money...,"Although, the binding is eye-catching, the book itself is not worth the price. The entire book has roughly around 100 words total and could be read in less than 5 minutes. Unfortunately, the short read does not provide any unique or new information than other books of its kind, especially to readers already familiar in the subject. On a positive note however, the book would make a lovely gift to someone, especially for a beginner. For that reason, I gave the book one star and another star for its unique cover."
5,Dover coloring book; includes 2 full-color pages,"Detailed, informative captions accompany finely done illustrtions of more than 30 swords with their user. Includes a Sumerian bronze sickle, an elaborate Babylonian iron sword, a steel sword of the Chinese Han dynasty, a Scottish Claymore sword, a Spanish basket-hilt broad sword, a pirate buccaneer cutlass, and a Confederate artillery officer's saber. 44 pages"
4,Good way to transport knives.,"I bought this knife roll to transport my knives because I like to have them for cooking in a rented condo. It does the trick, but it is bigger than I expected."
4,Good starter roll.,"If you are just starting out in the food industry or have a limited budget this is a good way to tote around your knives. For the german battle-axes (what i like to call my henckles pro-s set) it's just fine, however i don't feel this case provides adequate protetion for higher-end knives, and when I upgraded, I also upgraded my knife roll. I would recommend blade guards with any case, also. my battle axes got a little scratched up from not realizing that. I gave this to somebody at work after i had used it about a year and a half, and they are still using it, and it seems to still be in pretty good shape, especially for the price. it was a good starter but I do prefer my messermeister case.Messermeister 8-Pocket Knife Roll, Black."
1,smells,"This knife bag is useless. Just invest in an actuall knife roll bag the kind with the handle.. This item also came with/has a weird smell to it. Its been over a year and it still stinks, not only performance wise."
3,"5 Star Knife Roll, 3 Star Size (it's huge)","Title really says it all - it's a really thick, well constructed knife roll, but it's massive. Maybe if I had a sword it would be the right size..."
2,Junk.,"I purchased this to carry some very expensive knives to my new job. It is horrible. Knives are constantly falling out, it is also very easy to cut yourself while putting in or taking out knives. It just doesn't do the job as it should, unfortunately. I am sending it back."
4,good item,We use this to store our old extra knives for when we go to friends' houses or travel to cook. This is a great way to carry them without worrying about damaging the blades or having the blades damage anything else...
5,Great Product,"This is a great product for holding your knives. My wife and I got a nice set of Henckel knives as a wedding present. I couldn't figure out how I could transport the knives. Along with the Blade Savers, this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives."
1,A product that does not work for my purposes.,"I ordered this item in hopes of giving it to my daughter for Christmas, however the size of the item and the stiffness of the fabric prevented it being useable for the intended application."
4,Good for the money.,This product is good for the money. It is a little longer than I figured it would be. I put it in my backpack and it sticks out the top. Over-all the quality of the item is quite good and is a nice entry-level knife roll.
4,Does what I wanted,"I just needed a storage device for my better knives. This is not what I'd want if I were transporting my knives all the time as there's no way to really hold the blades separated from one another. There's a flap that comes down over the blades, but nothing to keep them from tilting into one another.Still, it works and I'm satisfied with it for the price."
4,Good Quality,I use this Knife roll to store any seldom used knives in my set. The roll is high quality but rather long and hard to store. Check the measurements prior to purchase. Good Quality for the price.
5,Excellent for the price,"I purchased this item to take my knives to cook at another home for the holidays. I was able to take 4 knives and a sharpening steel with room for maybe 2 more knives. The pouch is very high quality for the price. The knives are safely and securely stored for traveling. When I first opened the package and looked at the pouch, I was surprised that the price was not higher. I highly recommend this item."
3,Okay but small,"If you only need to carry a couple knives and not much more this bag would be fine. As a culinary student I found myself needing to carry more small items like measuring spoons, pens and sharpies, thermometers, note pads, a bench scraper... and this really wasn't able to do the job. I ended up going with a metal toolbox, but I will keep this around for the times when I only want to take three or four knives and a steel to work."
2,Super small,"Quality is great, but really, the size is just ridiculously small. Regret having paid this much and will look elesewhere for my Waldorf-inspired dolls in the future."
5,Attractive and funtional piece,Good value. Holder is attractive and does a great job. Weighted bottom keeps it from easily tipping over. I will probably buy at least one more of these as I have a lot of utensils and this keeps them handy.
3,Not Best Quality,"At first they seemed fine. I love the red and white check. Can't find these locally. After putting them in the dishwasher, they have loosened up where the piece meets the handle. Also faded from washer. I love the look and had them quite awhile but I would highly recommend NOT putting them in the dishwasher. They should hold up longer if washed by hand. Overall, I would not get them again even though I do love the look."
2,You may already own this,"If you are a fan of Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex, and you already own some of the DVDs from the series, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!I bought The Laughing Man and as I was watching it, I kept thinking, ""I've seen this before. I've seen this before too. Wait a second. I've seen ALL of this before!""If you own any of the DVDs from this series, you already own The Laughing Man because this ""new"" DVD is nothing but a compilation of all of the previously released Stand Alone Complex programs. All they did was blend them together into a feature-length DVD. You do get a few changes in dialog and a totally new (and not nearly as good) voice-over crew, but otherwise you get nothing new here. The only good thing about this special version is the DTS sound. A step up from the other DVDs.If you have never seen the series before, this would be a great introduction to the series. Otherwise, save your money."
4,More Like the Chuckling Man,"I remeber watching this entire series when it came out, and could not put the damn thing down. It was incredible, ans still is. What this dvd containes is all of the episodes that deal strictly with the Laughing Man case edited into a single movie. It's not bad if you have already seen the series, but if you have not, I would recomend you see the series first to get the entire picture and scope of what this series was about. I really miss the talk-show segment from the series, as well as the evolution of the Tachikomas. But, as a movie, it's not bad. Some people will not like it, some will."
5,Another Perfect Movie,"This is another perfect summary movie, just like the ""Individual Eleven"". Loaded with high tech weaponry and equipment. I like this one in particular because it has twists and turns that make it more interesting for anyone who stays glued to every detail of the story. If u love anime summaries, BUY IT!!"
5,Excellent knives,Excellent quality for a very reasonable price. Cutting a steak feels like using a regular knife on soft butter. Quality product. I bought them to replace our old steak knives and I highly recommend them to anyone.
2,Unsafe base - Enjoyable Activities,"The base is not safe. If my child pushes too hard while trying to walk, he topples over with the unit. While I am always with my son when he is trying to walk with the unit, I don't want to see his confidence undermined by constantly toppling forward using the unbalanced walker. The front base needs to be extended before it will be safe. The activity center is great on the floor. My son loves the sounds and lights. The buttons help him develop dexterity in his fingers."
1,not safe,"I bought this toy for my ten month old, when the toy is in the walker stage I found if she looses her balance the toy tips back ontop of her."
1,Do NOT BUY!,"Okay, unless you have a child who uses this sitting down - do not buy. I just bought this a few hours ago. My son fell back and held on, and like the other moms' kids - he smashed his poor litle gums and bled a bit. I have the jumper and the radio flyer walker and a bunch of toys many would say dont' get...but this one...forget it. It's all top heavy weight and just not safe. If you are smart enough to read a review before buying (wish I was), save yourself the trouble of feeling like a crappy mom b/c you had once read it was dangerous. Trust me. Do not not buy."
1,Dangerous and unsafe! Do not buy!!,"My son received this as a gift. It is incredibly dangerous. A complete safety hazard! The toy toppled over, landed on him, and split his lip. This product has no business being sold! This should be pulled from the market!"
2,Top Heavy Be Careful,"My daughter likes to sit and play with the piano part, however, when she tries to stand or use it as a walker it topples over because the top it too heavy for the base.It's a disappointing walker."
1,Dangerous,When my daughter fell that walker tipped on her and hurt her face. We were forced to throw the walker out.
5,A great walker!,"I'm not sure why this walker is getting such bad reviews, my son absolutely loved it and we never had an issue with it falling. I had a Fisher-Price activity walker with my daughter and although she loved it, it didn't last for my son to use and they are only 18 months apart. This walker is very sturdy and the locking feature is wonderful. My son is big for his age and it was perfect. V-tech makes great products and this is definitely one of them. My daughter, almost 3 also enjoys playing the music. This is a toy that you can use for a long time."
2,Safety Hazard,"I bought this toy for my 8 month old son as an Easter present. He loves the sounds, enjoys dancing to the music, and likes to push all of the buttons. However, this toy topples over way too easy. Every time he pulls himself up to a standing position, it topples over on top of him. He also likes to pull himself up on the backside of this toy, and that's even worse. It falls over on top of him before he even pulls himself up. My husband and I only let him play with it when one of us are there to hold it steady and prevent it from tumbling down. This is all with the wheels in the locked position too. I tried it once with the wheels unlocked, while I was beside him of course, and it goes way too fast. Untrained feet that have never walked before have no chance of keeping up with it. I definitely don't recommend this toy. There are a lot more toys like this out there that are much safer than this one. I wish I could return this item and get him a different one."
3,It broke way to fast,"I bought this for my son, he loves it and plays with it all the time. But the turning key broke after only two months, and the wheel in the middle stopped working after about three months as well as the number five.I must of just had bad luck with it because he really isn't rough with it at all."
1,Dangerous POS hurt my baby.,"11 month old, steady on her feet was playing with this and the whole thing tipped forward, bending her neck far back, smacking her face on an edge on the bottom, and banging her shins into the back bar. She was screaming inconsolably, is nursing one leg and probably has whiplash."
1,Horribly Dangerous,This is a horrible product to have around any child. The base is incredibly light and tips over when a child uses it to pull up. My daughter pulled on this and it fell over right on top of her causing her lip/tooth to bleed. I cannot believe this product is even on the market!!! Now I know why it was so cheap. There are far better and safer products out there; please do not buy this for your child.
1,Unsafe,My son love this toy we were so happy he found something he loved just abought right up to the point when he pulled back didnt let go and bang he busted his lip blood and all he has never had a problem with any other toy but from now on this toys out the house hes afraid of it now.
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TOY - NOT SAFE!!!!,I had the same problem as the last reviewer...my daughter fell over backwards 3 times and cracked her head because there was no brake going backwards and she pulled the whole thing on top of her and it hit her in the face. This should NOT be on the shelves.
2,Not a safe toy,Baby loves this toy...until it falls over. She got her first scratch and bruise yesterday when she fell on top of the this. I am not a happy mama. The bottom is not solid enough to handle a baby who needs something solid to help her balance. It's a simple construction issue. Will go out tomorrow to buy another walker. I would recommend looking around for something else.
2,Other reviewers are correct...unsafe toy,"To be fair, our daughter LOVES this toy. She received it for Christmas and has been enthralled with the sounds, music, lights, and especially the puppy. She loved sitting in front of it and pushing the buttons for a half hour at a time. She learned to crawl and pull up on her knees soon thereafter, and the toy positions perfectly. However, babies don't stay in one place for long and she's now pulling up. We quickly learned the major downfall of this item. Only one set of the wheels locks, so when a baby pulls up on the toy it places pressure on the back wheels and the whole thing scoots back, toppling over. This is unfortunate because otherwise it is a great toy and concept. We have since removed the activity portion and she's still happy.This toy could be great with a redesign."
4,Could Relate - Interesting,"I could relate to the stories and the experiences of the these Black women, because I am them. We, unfortunately, have to wear many faces and don masks to survive. It can be stressful having to put on false faces just to survive, hiding your true self, just to make people feel comfortable around you. This reminds me of one of my favorite poems.Paul Lawrence DunbarWe Wear the Mask!We wear the mask that grins and lies,It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--This debt we pay to human guile;With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be overwise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, whileWe wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our criesTo thee from tortured souls arise.We sing, but oh the clay is vileBeneath our feet, and long the mile;But let the world dream otherwise,We wear the mask!The world has no idea of who we really are. My mask is taken off for only a few."
3,Thought Provoking,"Good book, some parts could be condensed but very thought provoking. Gives voice to many AA women in today's workforce who struggle with ""shifting"". Excellent read for book clubs or book discussions."
1,Not an original book,"This title has several information from MSDN. Some pages just copy and paste. Especially, DataSet and other ADO.NET parts identical with MSDN. I prefer they need a second edition to this book."
3,"Good, but not necessary","This book is good if you're new to Biology classes and need to learn HOW to study for a biology exam. The textbook has all the same information and then some, so this book isn't a necessity."
3,Lots of typos!,"There are a few comments I have...first, I find the workbook very helpful in understanding each chapter of the text. I use it every week and it helped me get an A in Anatomy I. If you read the text then do all the related pages in the workbook, your grade will show it. Trust me. That said, the book is riddled with errors and typos to be on the lookout for. The nerve chapters were the worst. It seemed as if the further the proofreader got into the book, the worse the errors became. Wrong answers can be found in places and some answers are given vs. a fill-choice, for example. It's odd, I know. It's not too much to expect near perfection in this type of item, I think, given the subject matter. Still, I think it is a valuable addition to the text. I would give it 5 stars but all the typos are too much to overlook. I should note that I don't think Tortora is the author, I think it is another person who is listed on the bottom of the cover, but this is based on the Tortora text."
3,Principle of Anatomy and Physiology by G.Tortora,it was a textbook that i need but it was a very good book.
3,It's okay,"I do find this software to be very good since I'm familiar with how to use Adobe Illustrator's 3D extrude ,revolve and Bevel effects. This software is good but version 9 is available in english too bad it's not being sold on Amazon.com.Shade 8.5 is pretty much a steep learning curve but Autodesk Maya and 3Ds Max are way harder and so are Carrara 6 Pro and Carrara 7.This software is pretty good for under $1,000 dollars though I think this software would be worth the price their asking for if it came with video tutorials and detailed documentation.I've recieved this software as a gift from my father and I think I have a basic understanding. I've this software for at least a week and I think I'm getting somewhere in the modeling aspect of this software.3D software regardless of it's vendor is very difficult to learn so you better have patience and hunt for online video tutorials if you don't feel like reading manuals."
3,Adult dot to dot books,"Need more adult dot-to-dot books, like books that has numbers from 1 through 700 to 1,000 some where like that. Thank u"
3,On the right Track!!!,"I must admit that this book is a very intriguing read. There are a few drawbacks, mainly due to editing errors which at times can be distracting and takes away from the meat of the book. There could have been more character development on the last two members to join the group. And the referncing of Mary's sword being the equivalent of a light saber was a tickle. Overall, as I read the book, I could envision the storyline in my mind as if it were really happening and it left my mouth watering for more. Especially the scene at Modeste's home. I especially hope to find out more about Fred and Liz's past/present adventures. This is a very enjoyable book to read and with the necessary editing and possible push from a publishing company, this book will be a definite winner. In many ways it already is!!"
1,poorly written,"While the story is fun and exciting, the sentence structure in the book is very disappointing. I recognize that it may be the author's style to add emphasis to ideas by writing them as stand-alone sentences, even if they are fragments. However, the children who are reading this book are usually also just learning how to write a good sentence; so the basic rule that a sentence should be a complete thought is more important in books for early readers than in books written for older audiences.I was also frustrated because it would have been so easy for the author to write her thoughts in complete sentences. Many fragments could easily have been written as the second half of a compound sentence.Some examples from page 6:""The lad agreed. And he beat the man. Fair and square.""""But the man was angry. And embarrassed.""""Like most outlaws, he stole. But only from the rich."""
3,Treasury of the Calligrapher's way,"This is a book of essays by eleven different authors dealing with different issues of calligraphy. It deals with Pigments and media, Pens, Pencils, Brushes and knives, Gilding,Skins and papers, ink, Binding,even Heraldry in Illuminated manuscripts, Design of books, cursive handwriting, etc. The book was originally written in the 50's and so is pretty much outdated today. And yet it is a treasure of information for those who want to use the old ways of the calligrapher such as Illuminated Manuscripts which you see little of today."
5,I am very happy with this stroller.,"I am very happy with this stroller. I love that it has a spot for my IPOD so you can you plug it in to the stroller and play your music, and the baby loves it!. The odometer is a cool feature too, but it didn't come with a weather shield, and I had to buy it separately. The only probelm that I have with the stroller, is that it is very big and heavy. Therwise, a great choice if you like to jog with your baby!"
1,Not really worth it,"This book may have been worth it three years ago, before the first movie released, to get previews of who looked like what. But it is not very helpful now, and plot-wise, it wasn't helpful back then. It is just a collection of pictures from The Fellowship of the Ring, with a smattering of text about the plot. The pictures, actually, are out of order. The front cover is also not very enticing, which was fixed for the photo guides of the next two movies.Face it, you can find these pictures and tons more all over the internet. If you are the ultimate, die-hard fan who has to have every bit of LotR-related stuff, then go ahead and buy it, but otherwise, I would not recommend it."
3,Could be a pamphlet,"The message is great, the writing is fine, but the book in general left something to be desired. Cheap paper, bad printing, and large type make it look and feel like a cheap paperback dressed up in it's big sister's clothes. Making money while he's still famous? I think his message is worth more than this cheap paperback with a hard cover."
4,A ton of good energy and wisdom,"I enjoy Paulo Coelho books, this one is a little bit different though. I am accustomed to his prose and the way he can tell stories and introduce wisdom in his narration, there was no story in this case, I missed that, instead I got a ton of wisdom, for which you have to really focus and read several times some parts of the book so that you do not miss an important piece. I made lots of notes, and highlights on the book, since there were so many that really touch me and awoke nice feelings that I forgot they were there."
4,I love it,"I really enjoyed this book, I love how paulo coelho write but this book touched my heart, I really recommend you, it is pretty good!"
1,Software from HELL!,"This software stinks beyond belief. Tech support from iolo is non-existant. Its interesting to see how many times the iolo products are 'duplicated' on this website. Just do a search for System Mechanic on this site. Is this a ploy to keep people from finding out just how badly this software is being rated/reviewed? Keep'em confused Amazon, maybe you'll sell System Mechanic 6 PRO to more unsuspecting souls! I wouldn't give it any stars if I could."
1,For New Age readers only,"This book was a major disappointment, as its intended audience should already be part of the New Age readership. She does not appear to have professional qualifications as a counselor or spiritual advisor. This is one only for her fans, not the general reader like me. If you like it, fine, but I didn't."
4,Keeps your Running,"This book is as complete a guide to marathoning as I've found. It addresses all aspects of training--both mental and physical--and racing, and does so in a way that will help people achieve their goals and more importantly enjoy the entire process. Bloom is not a particularly accomplished runner, but his writing about the subject is passionate and very clear and he gives advice from numerous sources--champion runners, non-competitive running lovers and his own personal experience. All of the information in the book is helpful and presented with a touch of humor that keeps it interesting. I would recommend this book especially to first time marathoners, but competitive athletes would find many useful tidbits as well. This is a very good running guide and should be added to every running library."
4,"Sharp, quality, but not German","It is great knife, but if you are looking for a German made, this is not it...It is made in Spain..It is probably similar quality, but Henckels are genuine German items, not sure why they start making them other countries.."
1,Please consult a Music Therapist,"I wish to give this book no stars.After I read about 15 pages of this book, and flipped through the remainder, I realized that it was completely useless. If you are interested in Music Therapy, I believe you should check out the American Music Therapy Association website. I am a Music Therapist, and I am disheartened by the fact that this concept (""The Mozart Effect"") is believed to be a research based idea--if you check out the research you will realize that it cannot be replicated (i.e. does not work), and is completely anecdotal at best. Take the information with a grain of salt, and realize that you'll have to do some research yourself after you read this to be able to make a proper decision about the information."
5,Music Therapist supports the big picture,"Don Campbell had the courage to show the big picture of how music has helped many people. He writes beautifully on how to inspire , focus and empower our lives through the inspired art. As a music therapist for many years, I help patients regain their hope and power with music. Science will never be able to measure the power of music. I hope science will begin to appreciate that no one piece of music will make us smart, make us well or creative. Good research comes from the antedotal observatrions. Pay attention to this book, it may open many new possibilities for music in hospitals and schools."
5,Well organized,Overall this text is laid out well. At times it veers off into tangents and loses its focus...I found 80% of the book enjoyable.. and well the other 20%...I just skimmed.
2,The Mozart Effect,"I still have not received this book....I forgot I ordered it......Any chance I will get it, has it been sent????"
2,Book doesn't do the scientific research justice,"When I first picked up this book, I was hoping that it would talk about the research done at UC Irvine by Gordon Shaw and his lab. I was shocked to find only a brief mentioning of it. Most of the book seemed non-scientific, and I felt that it tricked me into buying another New Age pseudo-science book."
2,Disappointingly un-scientific,"As a musician and a music teacher, I really wanted to like this book. I already agree with the authour on many points having to do with the value of music in overall well being. However, what I need most are not unsubstantiated anecdotes or third person hearsay, but some actual scientific evidence of music's ability to heal. This pseudo-science does a disservice to serious music teachers, especially those who need objective scientific data to justify the existence of music in the public school. No rational person is going to be convinced by this volume of wishful thinking and new age fantasy. Sorry, Don."
2,"Fun Book to Read: HIDEOUS ""Research"" and BAD Science","While I've had the pleasure of hearing Don Campbell speak, his information is, sadly, quite flawed. As others have rightly noted, the ""science"" in this book is simply horrible and there are many with his comments concerning classical music. The fact that he also copyrighted the term ""Mozart Effect"" is also deplorable. Finally, this type of book is responsible for placing music and sound on the backburner at many research institutions as it falsely implies that the use of music and sound belongs to ""new age"" nonsense. As a rule, I cringe when I see that someone else has used this book as a reference to back up other poor research."
1,This is junk,"I recently bought Suntune automotive gauges for my car, and I needed the metric adapter for the oil pressure gauge. I am quite happy with the gauges, but the adapter's are junk. Mine snapped off in the block with hardly any effort at all. Fortunately, it was easy to remove, since it was not very tight. On close inspection of the broken fitting, the threads are cut almost all the way through, leaving the brass fitting very weak. I just ordered the metric adapter kit by Equus, which has the same size fittings in the bag, and I am hoping to finally get the last gauge working out of the three when it arrives in a couple of days."
2,Different sizes than advertised,"I bought this kit for the BSP adapter, but when I got it, the BSP adapter was replaced with an m12x1.75 adapter.The adapters are good, they just aren't the ones specified."
1,An embarassment to the Foreign Service,"I just read the first 11 pages of this ""book,"" and I am ready to throw it away. Each page has at least 1 or 2 glaring errors that make it impossible for an educated reader to derive any pleasure from it. Although I don't know if the author or the publisher is at fault for this shoddy publication, but both should be embarrassed to have their names on this book. Someone invovled with this project is not familiar with the concepts of a complete sentence and subject-verb agreement. Grammatical errors notwithstanding, the prose is incredibly choppy and dry and is written on roughly a sixth-grade reading level."
1,For the love of god...,"How do these types of books get published? I just read the book (in about an hour), and it is replete with terrible grammar (first and far most?!), no punctuation, and meaningless stories. It has almost nothing to do with the Foreign Service, and is just a very boring travelogue of a few countries. As someone who is about to be shipped off with the Foreign Service I can only hope Mr. Mckinnon is not indicative of the kind of talent we have had as our face to the world. I thought ""Bush Hat Black Tie"" was a little light, but it's Shakespeare in comparison to this one. Can't someone just write a book about the actual job of Foreign Service Officer, or is the main export of Yugoslavia just more interesting to talk about?"
1,One star - and that's being generous.,"Terrible, appalling, pathetic, sad, disgraceful, insulting........ you get the picture? I bought this book thinking it would tell me something about the Foreign Service. Wrong. It's a book written by a semi-literate buffoon who has nothing to say. The fact that he represented the USA overseas for 22 years says it all - no wonder we're hated by many foreigners if this is the calibre of our overseas representation. Pray that our current diplomats are selected for their abilities, not skin color."
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS EVEN PUBLISHED,This book is so poorly written it makes me seriously worry about the caliber of people our government sends abroad to represent us!!!!
1,Simply shocking,"Shocking - that just about sums up this awful book. Appallingly written, littered with spelling mistakes, and extremely boring. McKinnon has nothing to say for his twenty-odd years spent serving the country overseas. Don't waste your money on this nonsense."
2,skip this one,"Although it is a fun travelogue about this Foreign Service officer's experience from 1966 to 1988, it is not much more than that. If you are looking for an insider scoop about life on the foreign service, this book falls short. I was also very surprised as to how poorly written the book was.On the good side, there were some interesting comments about what it was like being a black man in the foreign service during this period."
2,Was defective on arrival.,"The nut/shaft were cross treaded on arrival which made the bit useless. Amazon allowed return no problem...Would prefer having two bits, one for tongue and one for grove. Also would like to have various bearings, but Bosch does not make such."
5,As expected,Bit was as expected. Hubby was so excited about receiving it he spent several hours at his router working with it.
4,"Neat, but could be more durable","I like pretty much everything from Manhattan Toy, but the car seat gallery could be better. I like the cards- great images, color and contrasts, but the attachment pieces could be stronger and more durable."
3,Was hoping for something better,My 3 month old son doesn't even notice this toy on the back of the seat. And he notices everything... I read a lot of great reviews so I'm hoping someday he'll use it.
5,Must have for commuters,"I got this for my three month old daughter to look at while I commute to work (daycare for her). She is in the car 2 hours every day, and was going stir crazy the first few weeks after I went back to work. This thing it great. She is 5 months old now and still looks at it with intense interest every morning when I change out the cards for her. I only gave it 3 stars on durability because the velcro strip on the back, that holds it to your headrest, has started to come off, but I can figure another way to hang it if I need to. This toy is very simple, but very effective. I would definitely recommend it."
2,Not for warm climates,"The cards are fine and great to display for a small infant. The issue is the board that holds them - first the sticky backing marked the seat yet still didn't hold. Tried the hanger instead but it kept coming off as well @_@Safety pinned it up only to have the backing board warp due to heat in the car. Texas sun + vinyl/plastic = bad combination for durability. Now I simply use the cards where my son can see them. Wish they were laminated so my son could play with, handle them..."
3,Didn't work in my car,"Since I have the car seat in the middle, there is no place to really hang this. I wasn't a fan of sticking it to the seat as my car gets very hot in AZ and I didn't want the plastic tape to melt to my seat. We sometimes just use the cards in the house."
3,Decent distraction for drive time...,"Given my baby's love for a number of Manhattan products we own, I added this one to the list of must-have's.Pros:~Durable plastic holder can easily handle your own photos when baby is older~Large images ideal for developing eyesCons:~The velcro rounds on the back of the holder prone to falling off depending on how you hang it in the car~Not as useful for rear-facing seats as bottom two images obscuring by base (using a Britax seat)Overall a decent 'toy' for the car at about $10. Baby enjoys it the most when we pass from light to shaded areas thereby 'flashing' light on the images."
2,Kinda flimsy,The velcro backing never really stuck to the product or our car seat back. Not worth the price.
2,Didn't work for us,"My youngest screamed in the car for the first 3 mos. I tried this and it just didn't work for this kid. Also, we live in a pretty cold climate and one day when I went to flatten it out so the screamer could look at it, the thing just snapped in two! I can't remember why it folded up. But I can remember repairing it with packing tape."
4,Would recommend,"My baby likes these black and white wimmer ferguson products. Loves the mobile, so I got this car seat gallery to keep her occupied in the car. Its simple, inexpensive, and fits nicely on the back of the car seat. There are extra cards so you can swap out the cards periodically, to make it more interesting. This is not as big of a hit as the mobile, but I still think its a good product.However, I think a piece was missing, and I was unable to attach it to the headrest. Ended up afixing my own strap, and then it worked just fine."
1,Babies Deserve Better,"This product is terrible, billed as a baby product when it is made from vinyl that reeks as soon as you pull it out of the packaging. Manhattan Toy should be asked to recall the product. Beware of off-gassing from this toxic ""toy"" and keep as far away from your loved ones (and babies especially) as you can!"
2,No difference,I tried this product for a very fussy 3 month old. He could care less about it though. I wish it would have worked. He still cries bloody murder in his car seat!
2,still hates the car!,"My son likes to look at the pictures, but only for a few seconds. he still hates the car! The product does seem durable and nice and colorful, but he really hates the car. Giving him a small yot ro chew on seems to help a bit more."
1,Unsafe toy!,"We got our carseats fitted into our cars. We were reminded NOT to have anything dangling from the infant seat handles. Number one, you are NOT supposed to have the handles in the carry position when using it in a car, that is written all over the instructions. Number 2, they told us to NEVER have toys attached to any part of the car seat, as it would become an object that would strike your child, not even in an accident, what if you had to brake hard? This happened to a friend of mine, and she pulled over to a parking lot and took the toys off her baby's car seat and put the handle in the right position. The instructions are there for a reason!"
3,Melted on first day in car,"I put this in my car the evening I received it. The next morning the strap holding it in place had already detached itself from the back of the product. While it was hot in the car, it was not sweltering -- the outside temp was about 82 degrees. The glue that holds the strap to the gallery doesn't seem to be able to withstand any heat. It's strange for a product that is meant to stay in the car.I am planning on re-glueing the strap sometime soon. In the meantime it's propped up in front of the baby, and I have to say that she loves it! The pictures are really neat, and she's entranced by them. I just wish that more thought had gone into the manufacturing materials."
2,Had high hopes,"I had high hopes for the car seat gallery as I am a big wimmer-ferg. fan. My son was 4.5 months when I bought it but it seemed other reviewers had children even older who enjoyed it, so it seemed like a good idea. My son had little interest except to chew on the cards when I took them out of the pockets. I have since attached the cards to a mobile above the crib and he is still uninterested. I guess stick with 0-3 months for this toy.Also, the strap is only attached with adhesive 'dots' which came unglued immediately. We had to tuck it under the car mirror to get it to hang. The plastic case wilted in the heat, since it was not hanging straight.A big disappointment."
2,Don't try this at home....,"How sharp a knife do you really want to hang from a magnet bar? It is almost tautologous that this is a bad idea. If you can get the knife off the magnet bar with reasonable force, it's really not on securely enough. It's surprising for Henckels to sell such a silly gadget..."
2,Security,"I purchased TWO of these, because I wanted the extra security of a stronger magnet, but now I can't even get the knives off without impaling myself, so when I need to chop an onion I just throw it at the magnet a couple times."
2,Poor book,"If monkey see monkey do is your style, you may like this book. This book is not much theory. It gives some examples and you follow themI am foreign, the examples in this book are so simple that we learned in junior high (I am not joking, asking anyone came from Asia if you don't believe). I really think U.S. has to improve the education standard, otherwise, decade later, US may not be able to compete the rest of the world."
3,Why Wasn't This Released in 1970?,"One must wonder why this album was not released in 1970. On this album Chilton uses his soulful voice to great effect on most of the tunes. For me the highlights are the guitar rocker ""All I Really Want Is Money"" and the pop ""Free Again"". Even the deconstruction of the very heavy ""Sugar Sugar"" is quite a joy to listen to. This album is certainly ranks up with the best of Chilton's recorded output. Listening to this vs. his later work one must ask when did Alex Chilton lose his great voice?"
4,Great Bag for the price,"This is a great bag. It has a lot of room and is very durable. My only gripes lie with the buttons in which more than a few have fallen off. Otherwise, it's great for any occasion. I love my 'Jack' Sack!"
4,nice bag,"The color is different from the picture, but I suppose that is common when shopping online. It has plenty of room inside for carrying plenty of things. Overall, I enjoy my bag. It is comfortable and easy to carry."
2,Not For School,"Our 8th Grader wanted something ""different"" for school this year so he found this bag. The price was good and size looked OK so we went ahead and purchased for him. He is not able to use it because it's flimsy and not built for carrying books home. Light duty it would be fine but not for anything bulky or heavy."
3,Handy bag,"Nice bag, but you can buy one just like it at your local army surplus store. Don't expect it to be sturdy enough to carry around a laptop, but it's handy for carrying books & stuff. Shoulder strap could use some padding."
4,Great bag...but,This is a great bag. I recieved this bag the other day. The only thing I would change is to be able to make the strap a little longer so it would sit lower on my hip. I would highly recomened it.
1,Classic Disgrace,This bag did not even last me two weeks. I carried three textbooks and four lightweight notebooks and it fell apart.I would not recommend this to others unless they plan on carrying very lightweight materials in it.
4,Typing For ( Older) ROOKIES,"After many years of two finger typing, along with looking up and down I am finally able to overcome my bad habits and am getting able to improve my computer usage and more importantly making less keyboard mistakes."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed with this product. I love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste. They have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell. They are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil. Simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer. You should also know that this food product cannot be returned. I would have sent it back in a flash if I could have.
1,"Steawberries very dark color, almost dark brown",Not at all what I expected. They were almost a dark brown in color and not the taste of strawberries.I was very dissappointed in this product.But the packaging was very nice. And delivery was great. Received my order very fast.
3,HFCS = Sugar,"As I see right away that this product has HFCS as its second ingredient, I will not even bother. The 'corn sweetner' on the front of the packaging is ""High Fructose Corn Syrup,"" which is basically concentrated sugar. This product may be better than candy as a snack, but it is in not way 'healthy.' High fructose corn syrup is difficult for your body to break down and it's very bad for you. As a student studying nutrition, I would never choose a 'natural' product that is just loaded with sugar for flavor... this is why a lot of you have reviewed this as very 'sweet.' It is not the strawberry itself concentrated with flavor, it is really the added sugar.... sorry."
5,Bravo,"When I first saw this one..., I picked it up, I told myself that I was listening to this and I would not take it seriously at all. It was/is incredible. As an orchestral composer myself, I can honestly tell that this isn't a composer looking to make a name for himself (first off, he already has quite a name). The music is exciting, extremely well orchestrated, and it suprises you. Scored in the hollywood style with Chorus and orchestra, it has a great dynamic spread from very soft in the beginning to bombastic in the later movements. The Bohemian Rhapsody I will admit seems a bit Cliche' when I first heard it, but if you listen to it without listening to the original before it, it reminds you more of an early romantic scherzo. The Adagio is beautiful - comparable to Mahler. This is a composer who will touch your soul.I was very impressed by the way Tolga Kashif changed moods so suddenly and smoothly. I congratulate both Queen and Kashif for their accomplishments in music."
1,Boring as Symphonic Adaptations Can Get,"This recording reeks of a composer trying to make a name for himself at the listener's expense. Filled with endless slowly noodling passages that beat the Queen song melodies into a pulp. ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" is flogged over and over in a manner that is inferior to the original Queen orchestration. You've got to really want to hear yet one more Queen adaptation to waste your money on this one. Keep Tolga Kashif away from the Beetles' songs at all costs!"
4,good knife,"The knife I purchased had a smaller handle than I expected; however, it cuts wonderfully."
3,Very BASIC,"This book is good for people with virtually no Internet experience. It is also good for anyone who doesn't always use the best common sense - and I'll grant that there are a lot of those folks on the Internet. The book, however, is not good for anyone who is fairly savvy and just wants some extra tips and suggestions as to how to enhance their online dating experience."
2,Not much substance,"My main problem with this book was its length - less than 100 pages (excluding the excerpt from the author's next book printed at the end).Most of the advice and information in the book is either just common sense, or is something you could get from reading a magazine article about Internet dating. If you have no common sense or you've never used the Internet before, you might find this helpful. Otherwise, there's just a few useful tips - not really an entire book's worth of information."
2,Internet Dating Newbie,"There are some good tips in this book, like keeping first emails to ladies short and sweet. Also, I liked the tips about staying away from ladies that have other people in their primary pictures. If there's a man in a lady's primary picture how do I know that she's not keeping him on the side? If there's a woman in a lady's primary picture who's the profile for?Yet, I really didn't like it that the book mainly focused on what NOT to do. I want to read an internet dating book that mainly focuses on what to do, and isn't so negative."
2,REALLY BASIC,"This book is for someone almost new to the computer, much less internet dating. If you know how to log onto the websites you can pretty much skip to chapter 4. It did have 2 useful tip but most of the information in this book is included on the dating website tips."
3,Ebony Cello Mute,"Although the material of the mute is of high quality, the crevasse of the mute is not enough opened according to the thick of the bridge. I needed to take it to a luthier in order to give the correct size of the crevasse."
1,Decorative but that's all,"After my daughter returned from music camp, she said she needed a mute for her cello. I read up on them and it was suggested to try several types. This was one of the mutes we tried. This mute did not fit on the bridge. She was afraid that if she forced it, it would break her bridge. It is not flexible because it is made of wood. It is a very pretty but other than looks we find it to be worthless."
3,Care Bears:Adventures in Wonderland review,"It's sappy to the core. The story about finding the princess and ending up getting her doubleganger to replace her sounds like a bad Prince & the Pauper plot. Even with the scaryface at the end,I still find the villian song dull & droopy. I seen scarier things on WCW Monday Nirto in its dying years. The Rapping Cheshire Cat is almost as bad as the rapping dog from Titanic:The animated movie. The ""Im Mad About Hats"" song is cheesy & phoned in a mile away. Infact,alot of these songs are cheesy and phoned in mile away. The cast is bland at best. The upside is that the film is harmless enough for kids and the animation is nice. The Carebears version of wonderland is just fun & imaginative as the Disney one. Overall,Buy it if you are a fan of the Care-Bears watch it. I give this tape 4 out of 10."
4,A good price for a GREAT set of knives,"These knives have survived hard cooking for five years and counting, with only two sharpenings. The handle is comfortable, although it can be nicked in the dishwasher.The knives have good, one-piece blades. Although the handles are not the best, they are by and large sturdy and comfortable (occasional nicks aside).I was recommended this set of knives by a professional chef, and they work more than well in my non-professional kitchen. The only problem with this block set is that it lacked two necessary items--kitchen shears and a bread knife. However, buy them separately--there is space for them in the knife block....this set is a great deal and will more than adequately serve even the busiest amateur chef."
2,My handle broke also,"I have few Wusthoff, Henkels and those expensive ones they sell door to door (forget the name). I would NOT get these knives, spends a few bucks more and get the forged ones, of any brand over these. These feel lightweight and cheap to me and don't hold the edge as well as the Wusthoff (forged). Like Joyce Sackett, I only hand wash them (no dishwasher period). Somehow the handle cracked and is about ready to fall apart.I'm not saying Henkels are not good knives, I'm saying THESE Henkels are barely a step above cheapo knives. If you want Henkels, get a better, more expensive set. Which would you rather have, a so-so set for $160 or a great set for $180??"
2,Don't get these knifes -- get the REAL Henckels,"I bought these knives as a gift for my parents. I thought they were the same as the Henckles knives I use in my own kitchen. Nope. Not even close. These are flimsy cheap knives with the Henckles name but not the quality. They bend easily when you bear down at the slightest angle! I am so disappointed I'm going to throw these away, eat the $150 loss, and buy some REAL knives for my parents. I'm embarrassed to have given them this set."
2,Complaint,"I purchased the 7 pc. basic knife block set, #35340-000, at Target Store 2 years ago. The 3"" paring knife has a cracked handle. I returned the item to the Target store for an exchange or refund, and was denied both. The hardwood block also has come apart. These knives have never been in the dishwasher, so I assume that it is the fault of the manufacturer. I wonder if I would ever suggest purchasing these knives to others."
5,route 66 2nd season,"Every episod is all about ""Good Old America""I am very happy to see them again after forty some years later."
2,Horrible - Save up and buy a Chef's Choice M130 instead!,"We purchased this sharpener with our J.A. Henckels Pro S knives and over the last 3-4 years our knives have steadily become more rough edged and poor cutting.Today I got our new Chef's Choice M130. It is fantastic. No ""nails on the chalkboard"" feeling while dragging the blade through the sharpener, no rough edge on the blade. In fact it restored our knives to a better than factory new edge.I am 100% satisfied with the new sharpener. It cost $139, but it was WELL worth it for a great set of knives. We welcome the return of a truly sharp edge!"
2,Sharpener Review,"The product is not what i would expect from Henkels. It is rough to use and not a good sharpener at all. I would have expected a honed and exact instument, but i got crap!"
4,Sharp Edge Quick & Easy,"Most of todays kitchen knives are hard stainless steel. Therefore, they fail to properly take an edge when in need of sharpening. At the factory, the first edge is ground in and unlike the directions say, that edge sooner or later requires touching up. The Henckels Twinsharp Knife Sharpener does just that. A few quick ""pull thru's"" and the blade is dressed no matter the level of steel blade hardness. So, if you are not a master of the sharpening steel and want to do fast and easy food prep. Then by all means consider the Twinsharp. It really works, but sooner than later you will need to find a way to get get you kitchen knives fully sharpened."
5,Kitchen Snob,This thing works great! I've had it for a while now and it keeps all my knives like new!
5,"Works great, and super easy...","I previously thought the small hand-held Chef's Choice sharpener ... did a very good job, but the Henckels is cheaper, easier to use, and, I think, does a better job of keeping the blade sharp. And since I only use Henckel's best knives and love them, I figure that they know a few things about keeping knives sharp.The Twinsharp, having only one groove and two small ceramic discs, is much simpler and quicker to use than the two-pass Chef's Choice technique, which I found to be tedious and difficult when trying to keep the blade aligned. And compared to the Chef's Choice model, I believe (may just be my perception) that my Henckel knives keep a sharp blade longer after using the Twinsharp.With the Twinsharp, it's just 3-5 quick slides through the groove, and that's it! ... it's a great deal."
5,Great product,"Very pleased with the results. Was able to sharpen a fifty year old carving knife to a razor edge in about a minute. I'm always hesitant to use sharpening gadgets in my fine cutlery, this one works and does no harm. Great value."
4,Excellent for honing or touch up sharpening,"This is not a general purpose sharpener. If the V of the blade is too wide to fit the wheels, you will not be able to sharpen well. You could force it but you could end up notching the blade.If the V of the blade does fit the wheels, a few light pulls will make your knife bread and tomato-slicing sharp. Truly excellent.Back to - if the V of the blade is too wide. Use a normal grindstone to narrow the blade edge V to 20 degrees or so (doesn't have to be exact - guess and try a narrower angle if it doesn't work). Then use the Twinsharp - a few light strokes. After this you won't need to grind the blade further, just use the Twinsharp every few weeks to keep you knife in top condition.This is a good product, but I prefer the Pedrini model that has larger all-steel wheels. Much cheaper and easier to wipe the wheels clean. Knife comes out just as sharp."
1,Truly dissapointed,"I purchased this charger based on the excellent reviews. After trying it a few times, I discovered it was faulty. Upon ""rejuvenating"" the batteries, those in Bank A went through the three cycles just fine. Those in Bank B completed the discharge cycle, went for just a few seconds into charge cycle, then switched to trickle mode, WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE CHARGE CYCLE. I checked with the manufacturer, who said that this was a not uncommon problem caused by ""the charger's internalheat that triggers its temperature cutoff"", located under Bank B. In other words, a major design problem. I am returning it for a refund an going for the Lacrosse BC-900."
2,"Bad set of batteries, charger quit after 1 year.","I bought this along with some extra powerex cells. 4 of them were dead out of the box and won't hold a charge. I wonder how long these sit on the shelf before shipping.Also, the charger quit after 15 months of moderate usage. Now the lights flash back and forth between colors and the charger won't go into charging or conditioning mode.I may get the sanyo eneloop package deal next time around."
4,Charges only in pairs,"My single disappointment in this charger thus far is that it will only charge in pairs. I have some electronics which use 1 or 3 batteries, and that creates problems in using this charger."
2,not what i was looking for,"I was very disappointed in this book. I expected it to directly support the text but it was simply a collection of articles. While the articles were useful, I was expecting the ""readings"" to be more closely tied to the text."
3,Too narrow,This sandal is not up to the usual standard of Clark. The materials the shoe is made of is not a high quality and they are made narrow. I have tried on several pairs in shoe stores since I purchased mine from Amazonand found that this style in a medium width is more like a narrow width.I woouldn't reccommend them unless you have a narrow foot.
4,Love Jones!,Track #10 is the song that we've desperately been searching for from the lovejones movie (not a part of the soundtrack).
4,All web and product designers should read this,"This book has many examples of good and bad web pages and also consumer products. What it covers is seemingly obvious, but apparently not realized by many. It shows how users and designers can work together for optimal result. It should be a required reading for anyone doing user-interface designs. It is good that they actually have a good free product, HUBBUB ... .that was created using this design philosophy.I didn't give it a 5-star only because, to me, the section of their HUBBUB experience and the conclusion was too long and could have been made more concise. Also, it was disappointing to see their product not following their own design goals well enough, which seemed to make the book less effective."
5,A must-read for web developers and designers,"As an IT project manager supporting web applications, sites and portals, this book summarizes the story of my life. Not just a must-read, but a godsend for application developers and UI designers -- two groups who traditionally don't always see eye-to-eye or face daunting communication challenges. Can't we all just get along? Yes! This book tells you how, using simple, easy-to-understand language and real-life examples. End users and customers will thank you for reading it."
4,Lobe Wonder Works Great!,"I started using Lobe Wonder Ear Support Patches about five years ago when an already elongated ear piercing was torn, and I have been using them ever since. I had looked into having my ear repaired, but the cost kept me from taking the plunge. I have found these to be very efficient, though they do need to be placed just right in order for the sticker not to show. My only real complaint is that I cannot wear some of my heavier earrings, as they will stretch the sticker and it begins to pull off from my ear lobe. This is a small complaint however, and I will continue to buy and recommend these patches."
2,Huge disappointment,"The product did not help my situation, at all. I was hopeful, they are absolutely not worth the money. From the reviews, some people are happy with them, I am not."
5,Truly a WONDERful product!,Have had a torn earlobe for over twenty years.....finally can wear dangle earrings again. Super product - super easy to apply.LOVE IT!!
2,OUCH!!!! OUCH!!! OUCH!!!,"I should have known it wouldn't work. This product didn't do what I hoped it would. PLUS it really, really hurts to put earring through the patch. It eases some of the weight of the earring, but not enough to ever wear the earrings again. I spent over $5.00 shipping on a $5.99 item so I won't waste any more money shipping them back."
2,Not as good as One would Hope,"This book was almost okay, on a very, very basic level. However, the author said all he had to say around page 10 or so, and basically repeated himself to the end of the book in order to take up space. I found myself completely bored and yawning through the whole thing. I was SO disappointed in this book. I love Star Wars, I love religious and spiritaulity books, and I don't like this book at all. At first I thought I should give him kudos for effort, but by the end of the book I thought maybe he was just cashing in.Save your money. Or better yet, by the Tao, the Tao of Pooh, the Dharma of Star Wars, or the Philosophy of Star Wars. All are tons better than this."
2,Big dissapointment,"I was looking forward to this book for quite some time, being a big fan of both Star Wars and the Tao. I was immediatley turned off by how thin the book was. I was further upset when I opened the book, noting the large pring, generous use of spacing, and large margines (i.e. this thin book contains even less information that it appears to). The author has some good points, but most are very simple in nature and could have been summed up in a powerpoint. Worth a quick read, but not worth buying it in my opinion. Also, for those bothered by such, the author talks about Jesus in several areas, quoting from the New Testament. That was not something I expected or appreciated."
1,It Only Gets Worse...,"This series has taken a turn for the worst- both in plot and characterization.The stalking plot with Claire and Benjamin fell through, and the whole Lucas/Nina semi-romance didn't even get going. It was a plot that had potential, but the author (for some reason) decided not to go through with it.Zoey, once the protagonist, comes off as annoying, self-involved, and whiny. Benjamin has become totally unbearable. I hate to say this, but I actually feel sorry for Lara. Go Lara.The only redeeming plot (and characters) was Christopher and Aisha. I could care less about Jake and Kate, but I don't know how..."
5,It is on and Poppin,"Once agian it is on. Lara new very well that she was going to tell Zoey anyway. She just simply strung Nina and Lucas along. She was hoping that Lucas and Nina would mess up, so that she could tell. Lucas and Nina should have told the truth. Christopher needs to quit being such a jerk to his sister. It is not her fault that Aisha was a bit more intelligent than he thought. Her suspicions would not be aroused, if he had not been so rude and mean to his sister and had just been honest. He created his own misery and he deserves to be miserable. Kendra should never talk or look at him for the rest of his pathetic life. Christopher just made my loser list right behind Benjamin, and Sean"
3,Zoey is annoying me more and more......,"Before i start my review i have to ask does anyone else wish Zoey and Lucas would take their mak-up/break up shtick off the island? just wondering. Anyways, yes this is the book where Claire finally figures out who her stalker is... I figured out when she first got the pictures.Yay me....Benjamin has problems with his sight...and tries to help Claire with the stalker..and no i will not tell you who it is:P! Zoey acts surprised when Lara tells her something rather unshocking...Nina gets a ridiculous school-type job...and Lara makes some healthy steps to self-improvement while chilling at Passmore Cottage...oh yeah Zoey leaves for California in a snit...when this series started i really liked her tooo....sigh if ya wanna talk about making out(the series? e-mail me at making_out79@chickmail.com"
4,Priceless Humour,I love this series. I really love this series. I highly recomend it to any one who is a fan of the Black Adder or Are you Being Served.
3,Wait for the FULL set of shows,"This DVD set only includes the first and second series. They made a further two long episodes for Christmas 2003 that didn't make it to this set. No doubt they'll release a full boxed set sometime down the road and you'll wish you waited.By the way, the two Christmas episodes were brilliant :)"
5,Art imitates life...,"This is the most horrific television ever to be aired. It's the train wreck you can't look away from. Comedy? Horror? Suspense? Terror? Documentary?(the term mockumentary doesn't do it justice) All of these things! What can be said that hasn't been already? See it. Now. Don't wait for the Christmas Episodes, buy them later. You will care for some of these characters and you'll pity the rest of them. This show will drag you from one emotional extreme to the other within a moment. When watching, you will be in television heaven or hell (depending on the scene). It may not be real, but it has what makes the few good reality shows good and more."
4,Series is good. First two seasons are so-so,"Kinda disappointed that they did the first two seasons with a cast of Australians.The guys that Dwight and Michael replaced were hard to understand, but I am sure that's why they brought in the American actors.Since I bought this used it was in pretty good shape other than the couple of white stains on it. I really can't complain because one of them is probably mine(had the dvd next to my bed one night) Anyway, I hope I can purchase some of the newer seasons with Will and Steve next."
3,Valley 75692 Coupler Lock,"Does it's job, but after 1 year has developed a lot of rust and therefore is a bit sticky. Probably won't last another season."
2,Form over function,"If you're looking for a cleanly designed knife with a wicked looking blade, these knives are for you.If you are expecting to use the knives to actually cut steak, look elsewhere. The blades are not particularly sharp - they rely on the sawing action of the serrations. If you don't have firm grip on your fork these knives will just drag your steak around the plate. The knives don't cut, the RIP through the meat. The small serrations quickly become clogged and any semblance of cutting disappears.My wife has some steak knives she got years ago as a premium for buying a full tank of gasoline... these knives, with a few strokes on a good stone, will cut a 1 inch steak in a single pass - something you could NEVER accomplish with the Henckels."
5,Much better than the J.A. Henckels Int'l Mansion knives,"We started withJ.A. Henckels International Mansion Steak Knife Setand quickly up graded to Zwilling J.A. Henckels (aka: these S.O.S. knives.) They look almost the same, but there is no comparison: one cuts through thick steak with ease the other doesn't cut at all. I had 8 of these knives thinking I could still use the Mansion knives for large parties, but my guests complain that the Masion knives don't cut, so I just bought 4 more (12 total) of the S.O.S. I have owned the original 8 S.O.S. knives for 3-4 years, only washing them in the dishwasher, and they still look brand new."
1,Top edge is sharp enough to cut steak,"Unfortunately we couldn't get these knives out of the package safely -- the top edge is extremely sharp. As usual, Amazon customer service was great, but I'm still looking for steak knives."
2,tiny!,"These knives are TINY! They looked absolutely silly next to my tableware. Would be good if you had delicate china and tea-party like knives & forks, or maybe for the kid's table. Returned."
5,Practical and functional,"I was fairly clueless about steak knives,being a vegetarian, but relied on reviews to purchase this for my husband. He was very impressed with the sharpness and durability and especially the dishwasher safe quality."
5,Elegant and Efficient,"These knives are beautiful on my table and cut very well too. The style goes well with just about any stainless pattern, and looks like serious cutlery. Easy dishwasher cleanup and no seams for particles to lodge in. These are serrated, so they keep their cutting edge sharp when used on hard dinner plates. Overall, just a great set of knives from a great maker."
4,Wonderful Short Stories,"I picked up this book on a whim. I was so pleasantly surprised at the wonderful short stories it contained. The images were vivid, the tales were informative, and at times moving. These aren't boring essays. These are personal looks into the lives of the people who worked at the plant. My only wish is that the book had been longer and contained even more glimpses into the automotive industry at the Cadillac Plant.Perhaps the author should consider taking one of the stories and submitting it to Amazon as a Kindle Single."
2,I Want Color!,"This book is well written and the carvings are good, the best I can tell. But other than the cover, all the carved illustrations--and there are lots of them--are in black with no color.Color would transform this book and the wood-carving artist is VERY good at doing color--as you can see from the cover. I was expecting the interior carvings to have color, and was so disappointed when the book came.People need to know--and I SO wish the book would be reproduced with the woodcarving artist rendering those illustrations in color. Believe me, it would transform the book."
1,It looks fake,"this soap is what i call ""USA Made""....which means some US based company thought it would be a good idea to make a ""modern version"" of the African black soap. I ordered 1lb Raw African Black Soap from Ghana because the name says it all, its the black soap without all the added ingredients like the other so-called African soaps that don't have their ingredients listed. The raw product is better for your skin because their isn't anything extra that is added. All the black dye does is make a huge mess and can cause your skin to dry out or have a reaction to the dye. Raw and unprocessed is honestly better for your skin."
4,Excellent book for first graders!,"Lester Laminack has once again written a great story about a boy named Trevor who experiences his first wiggly wobbly tooth. This story is predictable but, at the same time, has a surprise ending that will bring laughter to anyone who reads it. Sure to be a smile to any child's face. Mr. Laminack gets inside the child's head to show you what it is really like for a boy to experience his first loose tooth."
1,Disappointed,"Packaging was inadequate for USmail. The cardboard box was crushed just shy of damaging the tube of jelly. Could have been a disaster. Will not re-order unless they guarantee 'SAFE "" receipt. Also shipper said release was 10 days earlier than receipt which is doubtful for first class mail to go from. NY to MAss."
3,Trimosan jelly,"This product is good if applied correctly, however the applicator seemed defective. The cream did not stay in applicator once it was removed from the tube."
5,Another Great Title,My wife and I own all the releases from Hillsong on DVD and this one rates right up there with all of them. A must have for those who love entering into His presence through this means.
5,a compelling look into the future,"Lester Brown and the World Watch Institure have revisited Vital SIgns in 2005 (they skipped 2004) and with it, again capture the key trends shaping our quality of life and economy.This book is a requirement for anyone planning and hoping to benefit, rather than be in conflict with, worldwide trends. Specifically, business folk, insurance, and those investing in the future would clearly benefit. I also refer to it when planning my career, advising others or if Im presenting and it has information I can draw from."
5,Replacing a lost knife,"I have several Henckels knives and one of them disappeared recently. Unfortunately, it was my favorite which is used almost every day. I was glad to find I could buy a single knife to fill out my set as mostly I found full sets of knives at the local store."
3,too long; should be 3 inches,"I have a full set of Henckels International Classic knives, and I really like them...except the paring knife. Paring knives are for working on food that you're holding in your hand (think peeling an apple) or doing detailed or small cutting work. There's no need for a four-inch blade to peel an apple or for any other hand-held purpose, and the extra length makes it harder to use than a shorter knife. Henckels International's other lines (Forged Synergy and Forged Premio) come with three-inch paring knives; why not the Classic line?Other than the length, the knife is great--I love the quality of these knives. I have had this knife for about 8 years now, and it looks like new, holds an edge well, and sharpens up nicely on my diamond sharpening steel, just like the rest of the Henckels International Classic knives."
1,Reader wastes time,"Book is weak and poor, does not contain many convincing facts and reasons.I consider that I wasted time and money."
5,A useful addition to your kitchen knife collection,"Excellent for slicing ripe tomatoes and thick-skinned fruit as well as dinner rolls, this is a great little knife to complement a quality set of sharp non-serrated knives."
5,It works as appetite suppresant,"Using Dr. Oz's recommendation for appetite suppressants; Glucomannan, Apple Pectin, Grape Seed, and Forskolin. And just added CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid). My appetite has decreased and I've lost 10 pounds in a little less than 30 days, with minimal exercise--that will change in the next month. Feel a little better too.Much less expensive than one of those diet pills that combines all or most of these ingredients.Also, Dr. Oz recommends a multivitamin, magnesium, and fish oil daily, for all of us. Cut the multi vitamin in half and take in the morning and then in the evening; take the magnesium two hours before any other vitamin; keep the fish oil gels in the frig.Quick delivery, good service, good product!!!"
2,Be careful with this book,"I bought this book online based on the rave reviews it had received. I have a son, almost 4 years old. The black and white charcoal drawings are very good and detailed, but very scary for a young child. One picture has a large wolf in the child's bedroom, another has a creature that looks human but with large fangs coming out of his mouth. I was very surprised the 3 prior customer reviews did not mention this. I definitely would be very hesitant about buying this for young children."
1,Bad philosophy for a church,The book purports to be a book about enabling persons in a church. The net effect - especially see the chapter on implementation - is to end up with a church that is totally controlled by the pastor or his minions.
2,Not the best product I've tried,"If you just want to learn a few words in Cantonese and learn well by plain rote, this is probably a fair course. However, if you're serious about learning Cantonese, skip this one and try something else. This course just throws out random words with no context of how they'll be used. Grammer and enunciation are given very little attention here. If you've studied Cantonese at all, you'll understand the importance of both. The audio is not terribly clear and the pronounciation doesn't seem to jive with what I'm learning from my wife and other courses.This course is okay for the price (I got it on sale bundled with the Mandarin course for $10), but if you plan on ever having a conversation in Cantonese someday, I'd recommend the excellent Pimsleur course. Basic Cantonese by Virginia Yip is quite good as well. Even Teach Yourself Cantonese by Hugo Baker is pretty good once you get used to the format."
4,Great Cantonese Software,"For people just trying to learn their vocabulary, this tool is fantastic. Much better than flashcards."
2,"Chips OK, Shipping and Case Very Poor!","When I received this package, the delivery box was all torn up and busted. I guess thats what you get for getting the SuperSaver shipping. Anyways, the Chips were OK, they felt somewhat like actual Vegas chips. As for the case, its very poor quality. The inside of the case, where you place the chips in stacks, is made of very poor quality. Half of the inside was torn up so bad that I cant even stack half of the chips in there. If you're only looking for decent chips and dont care about the case, then I would consider buying. Otherwise, stay away!"
3,Disappointed!,I was surprized how small they were. I was very disappointed with the size. I would not have ordered them if I had known this.
4,lovely,I really like these. They are small enough to wear everyday and I hardly know they are there. They are a good looking little drop earrings!
5,Good!,Has lots of stories and vivid photos. It will touch any horse lover with its beautiful pictures and true horse stories! I would recommend this book to any horse lover or someone who is interested in horses!
4,horses,"After reading the reviews on this book, I purchased it for my neice who is mentally handicapped and just began time with horses. She loved the picture cards and posters in the back of the book. Although the book will need to be read to her, some of the focus on what horses do will be at a higher level than she will grasp. Also, it would have been nice if there had been included a girl of dark skin with a horse, something for her to identify. All in all, a very nice book."
2,"this is a half good, half bad book","the first Half is not very good and really to be honest is very bad, we have a hero who has been around since the silver age of comics turned into a killer who makes the joker look sane, all done in the space of 3 issues in a rushed editoral mandated story line, there is no reason for Hal to go nuts even, all his cloest friends and even his girlfriend was not even in the city when it blew.but on the plus side you have Kyle, he gets more room, he's the new guy DC wanted, it's kind of like spider-man in a lot of ways for the DC universe, he gets this power, has no idea what to do, makes mistakes aned people he loves will pay for it, but it's good, problem is it's also short, just as he starts to really get going it ends, his rookie years would continue for another 100 issues or so.there are many betetr green lantern trades to check out, but if you need to see jordons fall or kyles start then get it."
3,Starts Lame But Ends Strong,"Having first read Emerald Dawn, Emerald Dawn II, and The Road Back, I figured this story would be just as well-written. I found Emerald Twilight to be really weird compared to the previous titles. I know Hal Jordan suddenly snapped, but he seemed to over-react to the situation. Everything happened so fast. If there was more time taken to ""accomplish"" all of his tasks then I think I would have enjoyed it more. That being said, A New Dawn was very well-written and Kyle Rayner was a very interesting character to read about. I especially liked Superman's appearance with a mullet (quite humorous, indeed). Because of the cool idea of Emerald Twilight (but poorly executed) and the great execution of A New Dawn, I give it a fairly good rating."
1,uneven,"Why in the world would very rich, pretty Clara fall for skinny, sick, out of work Stone? More to the point, Stone was rarely nice to her. It really was unpleasant to think that a young lady would allow a man like Stone such physical closeness. Why let him kiss and fondle her when he was not nice? Yes, as the reader you understood why he was so cold - India war and all that, but why would she like or love him? Too implausable for me. Also, the reason he was so down on himself, making poor decisions in India which resulted in death to the men who served under him, does not make him a better person but rather show an arrogance that is unattractive."
1,Diamond dusting wears off VERY fast!,"This steel actually works very well out of the box. The trouble is as stated above, the diamond dusting wears off in no time at all. I used this for two weeks at my job on high volume carving stations w/2 Henckels 5-star 10"" Granton Roast Slicers, & at the end of two weeks the dusting was completely gone on both sides. If you were to use this at home it would of course last much longer, but still not nearly as long as the Henckels Pro-S 12"" steel I replaced it with. My advice is to avoid diamond empregnated steels all together & opt for a high quality traditional steel like the Henckels 12"" Pro-S."
1,"Instant Gratification, Long-Term Grief","As mentioned in previous reviews (which now seem to have mysteriously disappeared) - sharpens knives really well for a short time, but then the diamond coating wears off VERY quickly - definitely not worth the money. Also note that the grit is also different on both sides - coarse one side, fine the other. Would bot purchase again"
5,How to live life in a hectic world,"I can't meditate for hours on end to have some peace of mind to live in this world but I can find 15 minutes three times a week to do this. I can also do brief meditations as I shift from one activity to another. This book has taught me how to do that. I am very grateful to the authors for writing this book and hope that in the future they will write more.Other recommended books? Thich Nhat Hanh's The Miracle of Mindfulness, Jonathan Carroll's White Apples and Charles DeLint's The Little Country."
4,not bad for the money,"the pro-58 seems to be a great detector on the highway as it is stronger on picking up laser and pop radar than any other model in it's price range. the previous reviewer may need to check the specs on his windshield to see if it has an instaclear coating that will dramatically weaken the detection (i had an eclipse that i couldn't even use a detector in). also location of mounting is crucial with this detector. the best spot is just under the rearview mirror, however, that is an inconvenient location due to the wiring hanging all over the car. the best location i've found for this detector is about 5 inches up from the windshield wipers. this allows longer range detection and allows the cord to drape inconspicuously over the dashboard. never ever ever mount the thing on the dashboard...you might as well put it in your glove compartment. hope this helps those who have bought this device. IT DOES WORK!"
4,Whistler Pro 58,"Well I bought this product a few weeks ago and so far no tickets. I live in Louisville, Kentucky and I think we are the 14th largest city in the country (something like that). Even when in city mode there are a lot of false alerts especially around Walgreen's, Rite Aids, and banks. Also I couldn't find what city mode to put it in from a choice of C, C1, and C2. I looked online at Whistler's FAQ and it says C1 is for larger cities and C2 is for smaller cities and completely eliminates detecting X band radar, and I have no idea what just regular C does. Besides that, being sort of large, and when I mounted it, it sort of tilted upward and still does this is a pretty good radar detector. Again I still haven't been pulled over, and I would recommend this product and it is priced well though I think it is a little out dated and I think law enforcement will be coming out with something new that this detector doesn't provide protection against."
2,"BEWARE Vehicle Battery Saver is NOT Selectable, the description is not correct","Overall this seems like a nice Radar Detector for the price, but the Vehicle Battery Saver is NOT Selectable and is always on, which means if you drive for 3 hours or more it sounds an alarm. By sounding an alarm you will automatically hit the brakes thinking its an alert, but it is not. After sounding the alarm, it then turns itself off. You then have to manually turn it back on. This is very annoying. Only buy this only if you drive less than 3 hours. The description for this product is not correct. On the WHISTLER PRO-73, the Vehicle Battery Saver is Selectable, whcih is the same product except with text."
2,58 days,"This was an excellent little product for the 58 days that it worked. I just returned it and I am going try the product one more time, maybe I received a defective one. I will update my review if I can make it past day 58. The thing that bothers me the most is that I couldn't just exchange it for a working radar detector. I had to send the broken one back and receive only 80% of my money & then repurchase. Oh well, it was still a good product, saved me from getting 3 tickets the first day I got it."
3,Whistler radar detector,I'm sure it works as intended but I purchased it for use in Germany due to the many cameras set up. I habe yet to see it work against those. Perhaps they are using a frequency now that isn't compatable with this device.
2,detect what?,"I recently purchased the whistler Pro 58 radar detector. Would I reccomend this product? Well, that depends on if you want me to lie to you. This product does not identify a law enforcement threat until you are within 500 feet(I'm being generous) of the patrol vehicle.I have had my detector for 3 days thus far, and since that time while driving at night I have spotted the the reflective decals of the patrol vehicles before my Whistler Pro 58 notified me of their presence. If you want to throw your money away; I'd say buy the product. If you want something that works well, look elsewhere."
2,Dull and Convoluted,"As my first exposure to Central Asia, this book was a soul-crushing experience; much of my inital enthusiasm quickly evaporated in the face of dry lists of succession, poor writing, and general lack of organization. The maps were worthless- I had to print and label my own in order to follow the obscure smatterings of geographic references. I can not comment on the accuracy of this piece; Frye throws enough arcane material at readers to appear informed, but nevertheless fails to bring the subject to life."
2,Heritage of Central Asia,"Basically a small, expensive and dull text book printed on cheap paper for a specialist university course. There are too many sweeping statements and little detail provided. The book is poorly illustrated and the maps very basic. I had expected so much more."
2,lukewarm scholarship,Western 'Orientalists' have a rather poor grasp of certain aspects of Asian history and culture. These mainly pertain to the descriptions of the nature of Asiatic religions and their role in history. This is particularly true of the scholars from reputed institutions such as the Harvard University. This book also suffers from the same problem. The ARYAN invasion is of critical importance to the origin of the principle Asiatic cultures and Indo-European linguistics in general. It has been very poorly treated. The later parts on the Achaemenid and Islamic periods have been better dealt with. The kushans while poorly understood have not been particularly well described in this text.
3,Just OK,"I love Henckel knives, and I expect a lot out of them.I paid 80$ for this set and I was dissapointed. The blade is a little thin. The handle is a bit small. The finish on the blade was a little rough.These knives are manufactured in Spain, not in Germany and it shows. For 80$ you can find better knives than these."
5,Pleasantly surprised,I consider the Henkle Steak Knives I puchased a complete success. The price I paid was very resonable the product sturdy and I am looking forward to having a life time of use out of them.
2,"Poorly Written, Don't waste your time","Of the six books on lean concepts I have started to read, this is the worst and one of only two that were not worth finishing. I completely lost respect for the authors by page 17 when they presented a ridiculous graphic called ""The Office Kaisen Cube"". On the same page, they introduce a concept called ""Structure, Lean daily management system, Mentoring, Tools, Technology and Teamwork"" and refer to it as ""SLIM-IT"" (Where did the two I's come from?). The book is full of goofy graphics and advice that seems to generate more work than actual process improvement. I didn't make it past page 44. Consider reading ""Lean Thinking"" or any of ""The Toyota Way"" books instead."
3,Very top level approach,I was disappointed when I got this book since I was hoping to see more examples of actual office kaizens. I was also looking for forms or templates that could be used for conducting kaizens in the office myself. What is offered is some general suggestions on how to approach office kaizens and how they are similar to manufacturing kaizens. Show me the data! Where are the actual results?
3,Common rail injection,"For a layman or a novice, this DVD contains difficult concept of how the injection system works but you may grasphow the common-rail injection system works. One thing that surprised me by watching this DVD is the fact that any brand new common-rail system uses extremely high pressure which gives diesel fuel high energy"
4,Great knife at a good price.,We have all Henckels and we love them. The bread knife in classic is perfect. No need to get the higher end models for slicing bread.
4,"great bagel knife, but be careful when using",this is a very sharp and durable knife but must be used with care as it could take a finger off if misused. but all in all most cooks should have one.
2,Somethings foods just can't be substituted!,"Most of the recipes call for soy based food substitutions and I tried several. I found the cheeses to be gross tasting and they leave a terrible after taste. They are also very expensive in this part of the country. The macaroni and cheese cost me $7.50 to make and it tasted awful. I made it three times using different brand soy substituted cheeses. It made no difference. Forget the cheese based recipies. Everyone that I made was bad.My favorites were the recipe's that called for everyday inexpensive ingredients like beans, rice, fresh veggies, etc. I also like a lot of the seafood recipes.Mary Lu does list all the brands and specific descriptions of the foods and that was the best thing about the book.I would not suggest that anyone waste their money on this book unless you like all soy products."
1,Did anyone bother to try any of the recipes before printing?,I tried two of the recipes the day I got the cookbook and found them disastrous. The banana bead needed moisture and the thai coleslaw was horrible. I cook quite a bit and was disappointed with the results of these two recipes. This book gets donated to my local library.
2,Very unclear,"I found that this book was very vague about certain important nutritional facts, such as a good description of what complex carbohydrates are. It is as if she assumes you have read either her other books or some other nutritional books before reading this one. It is not for the nutritional layman. Also, these foods that she recommends you eat are not very readily available in all areas, and are generally more costly than foods more commonly found in supermarkets. It is nice looking book, but it is not much more useful than that."
2,not practical cookbook,"The book has good ideas if you live in a big city where you can get plenty of tofu and soy products. I hope you love soy cheese, milk etc. as that is what this book is all about, health and NO MEAT. I think she has good ideas but the products are not very practical for the everyday person. You are also asked to throw out most of your current kitchen products and cleaners. She will give you other options which are not time efficient or pratical in my opnion but very environmentally sound. This would be a great book for a retired person or a full time at home mother who has older children and can spend the time required to do all of the things in the book."
2,sick of marilu,"I realize that she has many talents but her books are so much of the same thing!The recipes are difficult and time consuming and she has a very arrogant ""I'm right about everything"" attitude going. I think her book ""I refuse to raise a brat"" put me over the edge. I respect her for putting health first and sharing her ideas but her books are the same old things over and over and over ..."
2,Good Recipes -- Not-So-Good Writing,"The recipes seem to work and are tasty, unfortunately, I felt nauseaus with the writing. I believe only because of Marilu's celebrity status did she get away with her atrocious writing. She uses the phrase ""Listen up"" in one of her recipes, which may sound okay being said in person, but reading the phrase felt patronizing and outright stupid. The editorial remarks in regards to how much ""Joey/boys loved this and loved that and wanted it in his/their lunchbox"" started getting sickening after a while. I doubt regular Joe writers who are struggling and working hard to get published would have so much leniency from a major publishing house editor as Marilu has. But I guess when you're a former, famous TV star, the writing/editorial content doesn't matter. Marilu can get away with anything. Her name alone will sell the book. Sadly, this is the second book of Marilu's I have stumbled upon thrown in a box in front of a bookstore being given away for free."
3,"Good, but not so practical","I've been looking for a book that could give me a good background and details on how I could modify my diet since some health problems in my family and made me focus on my health recently.The best part of this book is not the recipies at all, it's the desciption of how red meat, dairy, refined suger etc., may contribute to diseases such as heart disease, cancer, weight gain and other problems. It also has a chart that explains what kinds of foods you shouldn't mix. O.K., so I admit those 10 (?) pages were helpful. The recipies I found a bit elaborate. I'm not saying the food is bad (I loved the sweet potato and spinach recipe), but most of the recipies just aren't very practical for everyday cooking. It was still worth it to get the book as an introduction to healthier eating habits and to understand some of the virtues of a vegetarian diet."
1,Pseudo-nutrition given the star treatment,"After looking through this book and Ms. Henner's other books, I'm left with a nagging impression - what in the world does she know about nutrition? What qualifies her to tell people what to eat to stay ""healthy""? She writes as if she's an expert, but she is not. What she is is a television actress and for some reason that holds a great deal of credibility with the American public. Some of her views are incredibly outrageous and scientifically unfounded.Bottom line, if you're looking for a book on nutrition, purchase one written by a registered dietician, not a television actress."
2,Informative - yet dangerous,"While the information contained in Marilu Henner's book coincides with tips and facts learned from nutrionists, alot of her recipes contain the use of pine nuts/peanuts. While of course, it's all to taste and preference, she does not show any kind of warning or disclaimer to the ill-fated allergic reaction one might have to nuts. More and more people, especially children, are discovering an allergy to nuts in the form of anaphylatic shock. The problem is one isn't aware of the allergy until a reaction is caused. As I learned in a lesson that almost cost me my life a few years back, I wasn't aware of my allergy to pine nuts until a meal containing them was ingested. Even the back of a bag of plain M&M's chocolate shows a statement pertaining to the fact that there ""may be trace elements of peanut"". Ms. Henner should have done the same in her book."
4,"Great Way to Get the ""Big Picture""","Do not follow the recommendations of the other reviewers for this book. It is a good book. It is not the only source necessary to score a 240 on your Step 2 Exam, however. You need to study your [rear] off using the more in-depth study guides and lecture notes you used to study for your clerkship exams, BUT ""Crush the Boards"" is an excellent way for you to spend the last two weeks studying for the Step 2 Exam, because it will allow you to bring it all together. ""Crush the Boards"" is an easy read, is up to date on management guidelines, and is well written. It is no where near complete as far as what you need to know for the exam. Use it as I have mentioned, and it will help you. Use it as the other reviewers here have mentioned, and you will be disappointed in your Step 2 score."
5,thumbs up,This book was right on the money and the best source I found for sub-specialty high yield info. Much material appeared on the boards in the same fashion it was presented in the book.
2,EXPECTING BETTER,"Overall, it's a good book but absolutly not the best among usmle step 2 books. Its disorganized pattern makes it kind of difficult to follow and memorize. Moreover, there are some errors, some of which are not easy to realize."
2,"Expensive Toilet paper, read 10 min before exam","This, along with the other books by Adam Brochert are very misleading and very low yield. Just reading this wont help youanswer very long, tricky usmle questions. You need to get into the hard stuff : Harrisons Pretest for INternal Medicine is perfect for step 2 as well as Frontrunners Q&A.The problem with most question sources is that they only require you to identify 1 piece of information to correctly answer the question. On the boards, you have to collect Multiple data then make a determination ; plus, their are distractors that no other question bank has ( eg : Kaplan ). Ditch this easy stuff and press your intellect with the challenging things as that is what you will see on test day. I know, this isnt a question book, but it represents the simple minded thinking that lazy people look for when selecting sources. High Yield INt.Medicine is Superb because it has more clinical info than this book and it can be reviewed over fast."
2,More like Wisecracker Crumbs,Unfortunately so few of the crackers came intact for a true flavor test. I can say they made an excellent breading for fish?! I did get a replacement shipment of crackers and they were also crushed when they arrived.
3,"good packaging, good dvd, bad book","onedotzero name is much more than this book. Good cover and interesting packaging. Book is full of motion graphics but not considering, mostly trash. It worth to buy for the DVD not for the book. Watching is a better way in motion graphics instead of looking on dead paper."
2,Lid was crack when I recieved it in the mail.,"Lid was crack when I recieved it in the mail, so I called the company and they said they would send me a new one. Well it has been 2 weeks and no sign of the new litter box. I lady on the phone told me she would get it sent out Priority and that I would have in 2-4 days."
3,Brodhead Sharpener,"Product was delivered as advertised, but is more difficult to use than as advertised. Not sure of how effective it really is. As for the supplier, this product was delivered on time."
2,Diamond sharpener needs some work,"Althought the grinding surfaces work well at removing material from the object being sharpened, the plastics block that positions the stones at an angle is not equal on either side causing one edge to be cut at a different angle than the other.I plan to cut the diamond stones off the plastic and attach them to a wooden V-block so the angles are precise."
3,not as good as the other books.,"I love the Seth Books, and bought this one inspite of some of the reviews. However, it does not live up to the other books such as ""Seth Speaks"" and ""Unknown Realities vol 1 and 2"". In fact what I liked most about it was it wasn't filled up with pages and pages of notes from Robert Butts. The Magical Approach is 17 sessions that were given while Jane and Seth were producing another book. Some of Robert Butt's essays are just too much for these books, as I would rather read what Seth has to say and not so much of a commentary.I would pick this one last if you feel you need to read the whole collection. Start with ""Seth Speaks, and the Nature of Personal Reality and you will get the jist of the message."
1,Again with the channeling,After reading other Seth Books I found this book not worth the price. It was rambeling and unintelligable. I found this book very difficult to make any sense of. I was disappointed as I have read other Seth books as channeled by Jane Roberts and found them very worth while. This was a real rip off by the author.
2,more about Jane and her husband,This wasn't well written or organized. The style that Seth speaks in is very hard to understand. I didn't get much out of it and didn't finish.
5,Magical equals Miraculous!,"Thought provoking, creative and challenging. A different read from other Seth books in that these are more 'overview' sessions, touching on very interesting and diverse material."
3,"More of the story of Jane, Rob, and Seth","Interesting because of personal glimpses of Jane's health situation and Seth's comments thereon. I doubt it would be of great interest or help to someone coming to Seth for the first time. Better to start with either Seth Speaks or one of the ""Seth books,"" rather than with this compilation of ""sessions,"" however carefully selected. And for us old-timers, there's nothing much in the teachings that Seth hasn't said elsewhere--good reminders, tho."
2,The Magical Approach: Seth Speaks About the Art of Creative Living,"If you're looking for LOA material, this book is very dense, difficult to read. Not nearly as smooth and streamlined as Abraham-Hicks materials. Much of it has more to do with Jane Roberts and her husband's personal lives and artwork, than it does with LOA. I was disappointed."
1,Very Disappointing,"I am totally into the Seth books, but this one I sent back, I just could not even relate or get into it, not the seth quality I'm use to reading."
1,no one will buy this because you can't even get the person in the picture right!!,THIS IS JOE PERRY. NOT STEVEN TYLER. You might have better luck selling an item if you actually know what you're selling.
3,Steven Tyler?,"I do not own this poster, but I would like to point out that this is Joe Perry, not Steven Tyler as it says."
3,It's OK,"The only thing I was disappointed with about this knife is that the silver on the three rivets was chipping off. I noticed this was occuring with some of the other international classic knives as well. I didn't even run them through the dishwasher!People say that if they are Henckels, they shouldn't be doing that!"
1,Don't expect a real atlas!,"I returned this ""Atlas"" as it was not at all what I was looking for. A very thin volume with a few maps; you could find more detailed maps practically anywhere, including online of course. I can't say much about the almanac section of this booklet(and I mean ""booklet"", not ""book""), as I was so disgusted with the meager atlas that I decided to mail it back ASAP. I can't even recommend this for children, as they will learn little about anything except for where the broadest outlines of countries exist. This item is not very expensive, but I felt it was overpriced for something presenting so little information. I subsequently bought a very recent, very detailed atlas from an Amazon marketplace seller for about $22-. It was used, but in perfect condition as it was from a library in Canada. You can get something great, that doesn't cost as much as the Oxford Atlas(which costs ~$150-,if I remember correctly); don't bother with a cheap booklet."
3,Read more carefully,"It wasn't what I was expecting. Guess that ismy fault, if I had read the info on it I wouldhave known it was for notebooks as in school notebooks"
4,Effective.,"This 12"" steel performs its job admirably, providing a nice long surface to stroke a blade across and developing a distinctive ring characteristic when the blade is struck across correctly.I've been maintaining my blades for about six months with it and have had no need to pursue any further sharpening as of yet."
5,Perfect Honing Steel,"After using my oil stones to sharpen my knives, this is the best steel I have used to maintain that nice edge. The handle is nice and bulbous with a good texture to maintain a solid grip. At 12"", it is an ideal length for honing all of my knives, from pairing knife up to 12"" slicer. The thick hanging ring keeps it hung up and out of the way. Overall, this a very well-designed and effective item."
4,Works as advertised,"The product works, but the whole package is a little tall. In my case, I had to unclog my bathroom sink and the unit would not fit completely. I had to use the refill kit by itself and create a makeshift seal with a paper towel and water. Even then, the can was cocked sideways slightly. One thing to keep in mind is that the pressure has to put the stuff in the drain somewhere. I had to put a wet towel over the sink's overflow hole to stop the blown up stuff from shooting everywhere."
5,What a great idea!,"I laughed, I cried! There is so much in this book! Good advice, humor, perfect not just for grads but for kids just heading off to college who wonder just what they can expect. pretty motivating and inspirational. Great collection!"
4,iT IS WHAT IT IS,Item works well and it is what it is. Works as it is suppose to work and pretty well at that.
5,"Works well, good quality","This steel is well made. It has a composite handle into which the steel is firmly embedded. The steel hasn't rusted and has trued the edges on many of my blades, including almost daily use with my high-carbon content chefs knife. Works great, hangs next to my cutting board and was a good value."
5,sharpener,"Bought it to bring back to Seoul, Korea second residence. Nothing similar there at a reasonable price. Already had one here in the US."
3,not as pictured,"Good product. I'm happy with it's quality and proformance. It's not as pictured though. The company name and logo ""is"" embossed on it. . . but, very small and descretly. No colour logo. If they'd used a picture of the actual product, I still would have ordered it but would have been happier receiving it. Needless ""bait and switch"" tactic demands a loss of at least two stars."
1,misrepresented on site,"This item was listed on the site as $9.95, but when I put it in my cart, the price changed to $17.95. Sounds like the carrot and the stick theory."
3,Works for the price,Doesn't get it fine sharp like my old one did but it works ok for the price. So if you want or need a really sharp blade then get the more expensive one.
4,Wonderful,This was a Christmas gift to our son-in-law. My husband showed him how to use it. Our son-in-law told us all their knives were so dull they couldn't cut a slice of bread and now they are super sharp and they are thrilled!
5,Knives cutting better,"After moving I could not find my old sharpener so I went out looking for a steel. I figured my knives didn't need real sharpening so I purchased one of these. They are back to their old clean slice. Works well, nice price, nothing more to say that hasn't been said by others."
4,It works!,This sharpening steel keeps my cheap chef's knife nice and sharp. I had to thwart an uprising of tomatoes trying to dispose of it.
4,Staying Sharp,"This was purchased for my husband. He is extremely picky and thought it was great! Works well, but a little shorter than our last steel."
4,"From Volume 40 (2000) of ""The University Bookman""","""Poetic Knowledge skillfully excavates an essential mode of human knowledge. It is a mode as proper to our intelligence as it is redolent of man's transcendence and the value of knowledge for its own sake. Until we understand the philosophical rigor and precision behind the following statement, our darkened era will persist in its educational malaise: '[T]here can be no real advancement of knowledge unless it first begin in leisure and wonder, where the controlling motive throughout [is] delight and love.'""--David Whalen, Hillsdale College"
1,Parrotheads Beware!,"Stay away, all Parrotheads! This book should be called ""An intruder's guide to Jimmy Buffett,"" not ""An insider's guide to Jimmy Buffett""! Mr. Ryan is writing this book upon assignment, not because he is a fan of Buffett's, and this is quite obvious. Although he states by the end of the book, he has become a Buffett fan, his review of both Buffett's music and the Parrotheads as a whole is amateurish and insulting. He portrays the Parrotheads as a nameless, faceless group with nothing better to do with their lives than get drunk and wear Hawaiian shirts. His book ends with an encounter with Jimmy Buffett, in which Buffett becomes angered at the thought of Mr. Ryan writing a book about him. Although he couldn't have known it at the time, Buffett's reaction was quite appropriate!"
2,Not Bad for an Un-Parrot Head,"Thomas Ryan has attempted to become an ""insider"" with this book, but it is obvious that he is writing this as an assignment and not a passion. Ryan does, however, present some basic Buffett facts, but his evaluation of Buffett's music is exactly that-HIS EVALUATION."
1,This book in short is horrible.,"This book has a terrible title. First of all, it is not a ""Companion."" I'm sure Ryan is a nice guy, but I found myself cringing at his insight. Second of all, the guy went to 2 Jimmy Buffett concerts. Many of us do that in year. How is he an ""insider""?I hate to be negative, but this book is awful. The only interesting chapter is the very last one where we get to see a confrontation with Marvin Gardens himself! All that Thomas Ryan does in this book is review all of his albums. WELL! Let people listen for themselves. Sorry Thomas, this book was not something you should have taken on."
2,An outsider tries to be an insider,"Regardless of what Ryan claims the book only scratches the surface of both fans and Buffett. Ryan has a tendency to make snap judgements about Buffett fans, band members, and Buffett himself. It quickly becomes obvious that he is an outsider looking in as opposed to a true ""insider"" as the title suggests. His admission to not being a real parrothead suggest that perhaps the book was written more with a profit margin in mind rather than any real attempt to explain the parrothead mentality. What is more, it does little to shed light on anything new about Jimmy. It just gives us one more opinion about Jimmy and Parrotheads. And we all know what opinions are like."
1,Not a gift for Parrot Heads,"I got this book from a well meaning spouse for Christmas 2005. I have been a Parrot Head for the last 7 years. I did not like this book. The only part of this book that I found worth reading was the part after each album's review, the author wrote a few paragraphs about what was going on in Jimmy's life or with the record companies at the time that the album was recorded and released. I found the historical background interesting. The second part of the book was devoted to reviewing the books that Jimmy has written. The reviews were way to long and to me, seem self serving. Other than that, not worth your time."
1,Nothing you can't already find on the internet,It looks like ryan just swiped all of his stuff from the various chat rooms on the internet. Nothing new or intersting is forthcoming in the book.
4,Practical and easy to apply,"Very worth the purchase. It's got lots of great stuff that's easy to apply. I've applied lots of the book's stuff and they work! I don't like how it was written, but I can't deny it was good stuff. It was written like a story and it was about a hamster...weird. The way it was written has made it a little hard to recommend to just anyone; keep an open mind and keep reading it even if you feel it's starting to feel like a children book."
4,Great Ideas,"Great book - anyone who feels overwhelmed with email should read this book. Face it, we all get too much email! There are some great ideas that can be implemented organizational-wide."
5,Excelent Book,"Excelent Book, using the strategies presented on it really helps to manage email. have succesfully reduced 30% of my email."
4,Great new tips for email,"Purchased the audio tape for the car. Easy listening and great tips on productivity for managing email overload. Makes you think before you send an email, sculpt it, use categories for easier identification/prioritization and shows new system for filing and finding anything anytime. It worked for me and can warmly recommend to everybody! Join the Hamster Revolution!"
4,Mel Ott: The Gentle Giant,"As the author of MEL OTT:THE LITTLE GIANT OF BASEBALL, I had a special interest and perspective in reading this book. I found it to be very well done and an excellent complement to my book. I was especially interested in the views of Ott's family and other acquaintances on this wonderful player and exemplary man."
2,"Mel Ott: The Gentle Giant (American Sports History Series, No. 24",Only half the book is about Mel Ott. The rest is about things such as Bobby Thomson's home run and the Giants moving to San Francisco. I expected to read more about Mel Ott and was disappointed with this book.
1,The Hunt,I want another Rita Mae Brown. Jan Neuharth may be a good writer but the slimy predictableness of her major antagonist and the wearying nasty perpetrations on the protagonist are exhausting. sigh
2,Very disappointed.,"I was very disappointed. This book came highly recommended, but I simply could not warm to the protagonist: a man so terminally stupid one wonders how he could possibly have passed the bar. The foxhunting action is meagre at best, the hunting lore is not *quite* correct (one ""casts off"" knitting - one ""casts"" hounds!!). Ms. Neuharth should leave it to the pros. Keep your money in your pocket and spend it on the next Rita Mae Brown."
1,The Hunt,I did not care for the book. I would not have given it a star but could not submit review without it
3,Ahem,"With such a glowing review from the darling Marion Chungo, I thought it would be more enjoyable. Guess that's what happens when friends write reviews though, huh?"
1,Hunt review,It didn't hold my interest. I quit reading in the second chapter. Maybe I'll come back to it later. A horse person may like to read about the Hunt
3,Squandered Opportunity,"I like the fox hunting that frames this whodunit story. The twists and turns weren't all that surprising, though. This had so much potential, I'm bummed it didn't turn out better. I look forward to reading more from the author, because I think Neuharth has talent. It just seems squandered with this work."
2,stereotyped and predictable,"I thought this would be an enjoyable read since I'm an active foxhunter, but I found the characters to be very stereotyped and the story too predictable. The story pits the noble, good, old moneyed rich against the working poor (and worse yet, West Virginia ""white trash""). Not surprising, I guess given the authors background. The ending suggests a sequel; I'll know better next time."
2,Wooden Characters Need Something to Do - How About Hunting?,"This book would benefit from more hunting action (see Rita Mae Brown's Outfoxed for an example), and characters that are less wooden and featureless. Snooty Bachelor Doug, Ice Queen Lawyer Anne (as a woman lawyer I am particularly sick of this sterotype), adorable, smarmy little girl add up to a snooze of a plot. Even Doug's horses are devoid of personality. If we can't warm up to the characters, at least give us some thrilling hunt action to enjoy."
3,Hunt for Something More Exciting,"I didn't think this novel was as exciting as it could have been. The characters were kind of so-so, and it took me a while to read it (no page turner). I am a fan of mysteries and romances, and this didn't cut it with me."
2,Not so innocent,"In the few pages w/in this book (there are no words, only pictures), there is a boy being ""whitewashed"" in the face with snow. He is smiling, but who ever enjoys a face-full of snow? How do I explain this image to my toddler boy? I don't want to give him any ideas. I am returning this book and the other three Gerda Muller books. Disappointed."
3,Very Nice...But,"I've tried my new shears and yes, they are super sharp and cut through anything.The downside is that the handle design is such that when your hands are coated with poultry fat,(inevidible during the process - at least for me), the shears become very difficult to keep a grip on or keep in position.I heeded the advise of Joe Blankenfield and spray the 'suckers' with a light coating of Pam spray immediately after washing and drying them, making sure that I get the spray inside the spring. They look like brand new - no spotting, etc. Thanks, Joe.<P(...)"
2,Really hard to hold onto with slippery fingers,"They are really pretty, but the handles curve the wrong way. I have large hands but I'm having a really hard time holding onto these against the spring so I'm returning them. (Plus I missed the part where they can't go into the dishwasher. Opps! (Not that I've put them there yet, but I read the care tag that came with them.)"
4,Highly recommended,This is a quick and easy to read book to help you remember the different ways that you can show your husband that you love him. It doesn't require a lot of time.
3,objective and enlightening but dry and academic,"Race's book describes why the peasant population of a strategic province near Saigon revolted against the South Vietnamese government. He explains by means of interviews and analysis of Communist and non-Communist documents and intelligence data how the National Liberation Front was able to build a base of support for its war against the South Vietnamese government. He also reveals why various counter-insurgency efforts against the NLF failed so badly. The book is full of anecdotal, quantitative, and documentary support, but suffers somewhat from a dry, academic style of analysis. Nonetheless it is one of the true classics on this subject."
3,made bad order good,This item is not at all what they represent. The item is a iron ball not a rubber nocken type ball as the picture indicates. Avoid this merchant.Merchant replaced the item with the proper item and changed the picture online to represent what they actually are selling here.
5,A Novel to Savor,"I savored each page of this novel, reading many sentences over and over again. The experience was delicious, transporting, expansive, and playful. Diane Frank's sentences are not merely a way to find out what happens next or even a display of her mastery of language (although they do both of these things in a compelling way), but the sentences themselves are like magic spells. Their poetic imagery worked on me like a snake charmer's music. They took me in new directions, regardless of my own nature or intentions. Yukiko, the geisha, is almost angelic in her subtlety, yet, at the same time, strikingly down-to-earth and honest. For me, she began as a stranger and, in the end, became an unexpected mentor, teasing me to live on the lyrical plane she inhabits. Diane Frank put her soul into this story and, in the process of writing it, honed each sentence into fine art."
5,Blackberries in the Dream House,"Blackberries in the Dream HouseSome books take a day or two to read, and then haunt you forever. Blackberries in the Dream House by Diane Frank is like that. I read it while traveling, thinking to pick up a light book. The poetry of each well crafted line compelled me to turn page after page, the erotic subtext kept me prisoner to the last page.Chapter by chapter the lives of once-upon-a-time lovers in Japan, unfold like a silk kimono woven in dream time, iridescent, beautiful, fragrant. Frank populates her pages with dragonflies, thunder storms, dancers, sumi artists, broken wings of angels which turn into shards of glass and pierce lovely feet. I am so happy to have found this book."
5,works and fits perfectly,Exact replacement batter for the SK 3. Fit perfect and works great. Shipped on time as well.
1,F-ing Rip OFF - made in china!,"i was expecting made in spain, and the package says upon arrival ""made in spain or china"" and ofcourse the one i got was made in china. It feels like garbage. Not nearly spain quality, which is second to the german but far better than the other ""international line"" of crap in china."
4,Mine's A Little Different From The One Shown,I like the one I recieved better than the one shown because the prongs are much longer. It fits into my Henckel's International Classic Knife Block. It's a tad bit flimsey compared to the other International Classic Knives. It's very nice though.
3,Made in China,The serving fork is OK quality. But be warned... this fork is NOT made in spain. It is made in China (which is clearly marked on the fork itself).
3,Nice Meat Fork...shame it didn't come with the knife set.,"The fork is great...the tines are longer than I had hoped for but it matches the Henckels knife set I purchased earlier, and should have come with originally. It serves the purpose it is intended for."
2,turgid,"Most of this is competent roots rock with a trippy edge. However, ""Drinks @7"" and ""Swells..."" and long titles with no energy or anything interesting to say. Too much work to sit through."
2,No skip protection ... skips easily,"The sound is fine & the CD plays great. However, the fact that there is no anti-skip protection is blatantly obvious. If you move at ALL when playing a CD, the CD skips. There's no way you can ride in a car & listen to a CD in peace w/ this player. Don't buy it unless you intend to sit very still while listening to your music."
4,One of the World's Finest,"If you've never heard Tolonen, I'm not sure how you got to this review, since he's not very well known in the States, but he's been a guitar god in Scandanavia for decades. Man can the guy play -- his guitar on What Went Wrong on this album is easily some of the most impressive I've heard in my four decades of listening. Lyricism, speed, tone, imagination -- he's got it all. This is not my favorite Tolonen album, though -- the album ""Tolonen"" has more interesting compositions -- but anything you can find is worth hearing. (For taste check, if you like Zappa, Thackery, Hendrix, Hillage, McLaughlin, you'll like Tolonen.)"
3,it works.,needs a zerk. but then it would last too long and the chinese dont want that. I'm surprised it wasn't cheaper $$. Must be due to American mark up!
4,Very good in despensing CO2,"This is great in despensing CO2 in planted Tank.Remove the control flow and the foam, hook the CO2 tubing into the hole in its side and plug it.Can be use Up to 30G planted tank."
1,meh ugh,"I probably expected too much. The package that it comes in is 3""x7""x2"", which is about what I thought the unit itself would be. The little filter fell out of the box and I thought the filter was some sort of attachment or adapter. The unit itself is about 2"" x maybe 4""x 2"". I didn't measure the filter, just the box.About the length of a deck of cards and twice as thick as a deck of cards. I knew I wasn't going to get a lot for this price but I thought it would be bigger. If you are using it for a SMALL bowl it may be ok.If you have room, go to Walmart and buy the $10 filter they carry. Not the aerator type, but the small filtering one. $2 more than this one, better filtration and motor.Also, this unit comes apart for access to the filter area. It also comes apart to drop pieces on the floor because the attachment is horrible."
4,It works but needs some modification,"I have a 2 1/2 gallon bowl and I bought this to clean the water up. Pros- It picks up bigger particles. Cons- It is way too strong of a current. My betta was having some serious troubles against it even when the valve was barely open. Here's my suggestion to make it a great and cheap filter. Step one: Buy extra filter sponges, they only cost around $6 and trust me it's worth it. Step two: Take one of the extra sponges and place it on the end of the out-put cone. Step three: Buy some activated charcoal or carbon and place it inside an empty and clean tea/spice bag (about a teaspoon or so works). Then place bag inside the filter on the bottom over the intake area, underneath the inner sponge. With the sponge on the outside my betta loves swimming around it and against the now very gentle current and he can still float on top easily."
2,Way too powerful,"I have a 3 gallon fish tank with glofish and this was WAY too powerful of a filter for them and it actually ended up killing one of my fish. I had it turned down to the lowest setting and it was still way too forceful. I put an aquarium decoration in front of it to help slow it down, but I ended up just taking it out. :("
5,Exactly as Expected,"I read the reviews before purchasing this product, and was impressed. I received it about a week ago and installed it in my 3-gallon tank, which houses my male betta. The flow is a little too strong for him, even on the minimum, and I noticed him struggling a little. However, simply placing one of the replacement filter sponges on the output made the flow perfect, and the sponge is soft enough for him not to mind. It is powerful enough to keep the tank clean while being small enough to fit in my cylindrical tank. Highly recommended."
3,heated up,"hi...i used this in my beta tank and the filter was too strong for the beta, it created a current. So i did what other reviews suggested with blocking off with filter...it worked on cutting down the flow but made the unit heat up...my fish was slow cooking. I caught it in time and slowly reduce the water temp..my little guy is fine but the filter is in the trash."
4,Filter,"The product works great for Small aquariums. I used mine for my bettas, and my dwarf puffer fish. The current is strong, but it can be maneuvered to be less likely to blow your fish around. I rate this product 4 stars, because the filter can intake a lot of water and air, and leaves the aquarium with a bubbly curtain on the glass,although it works great. It could use some better filter cartridges. this one is a simple sponge. Overall, I would reccommend this for someone using it on a 5 gallon tank or less."
5,Excellent Mini Filter,This filter is easy to maintain and very cheap to boot. I've had no problems with it and I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for an effect filter that didn't break the bank with a bunch of useless high-tech gadgetry.
4,J.A. Henckels Oval 12-Inch Honing Steel,I really like this kitchen tool. I sharpen my knives as needed and the results are wonderful. I have the honing steel hanging above my knife block for convenience... but it also decorates a very difficult tiny slice of wall. Works perfectly for me!
3,NOT SUITABLE FOR GIFT GIVING!!!,"This is a gift--I haven't used it so I'm giving it three stars--probably worth 4 stars but I'm more than a little upset -- I paid $50 for an item that didn't even come in a box--just bubble wrap. I just ""assumed"" that it would be in a box with maybe instructions on how to use it, care for it etc. VERY ANNOYED!!!!!!! It's too late to replace it --(Christmas present) & luckily the recipient knows how to use it."
2,There are better books out there,"I recently bought this book, and let me be honest it was a waist of money. The language in the book is very similar to the material you get in a crash course. Author does very little to explain a particular topic, and goes by just mentioning it.I was particulary annoyed by the treatment of web controls, there isn't much than the documentation you get with VS.NET.You are much better of reading tutorials on the web sites than buying this book.I will try to return it to the book store and go for professional ASP.NET by wrox. I wanted to give this book just one star, but I am in a good mood."
2,Shallow,"After looking through this book's table of contents at the bookstore, I thought I had found a keeper. Halfway through the book, I am bored to death. It covers a broad range of topics but provides only shallow coverage on each. I've come to the conclusion that it would be a waste of my time to finish this book."
2,plagerism,"i thought charlie bone was like harry potter until i read this book! its a lot like enders game the series of unfortunate events AND charlie bone! what is this world coming to!why can't we be creative and think up our own plots. i know this review sux, i just wanted to state my opinion---i dont care if you dont like it!"
4,Great!,"I don't play hockey so my review might not be valid. But from my understanding this is a real vintage remake of an old hockey mask. It fits very well and it covers the majority of the head unlike other halloween hockey masks that just cover the face. There are 5 adjustable straps that are made of the soft first aid like elastic straps. These straps attach to a backplate that even protects the back of your head. The back plate is thick enough to prevent a concussion as it also has a foam cusion. The inside of the mask also has much foam cusioning. The mask is very comfortable, I personally have fallen asleep with it on so it's pretty comfortable. My nephew threw his metal toys at me and they bounced off this mask, no scratches were made as a result."
5,"Awesome, Very comfortable, Good Eyesight.","This mask is really nice for street hockey. It protects your face pretty well, the only thing I was worried about was my throat, but if you wanted it that bad you can easily attach a throat guard. For the price, it's a definite buy."
1,Hockey mask,"Great for street hockey. Good straps and some padding as well. Also will work out well around Halloween time if you need a last minute costume. Overall, a good value."
2,Rust & stain spots after only one week,"I bought this knife to replace a Pro-S 6"" which my wife broke. Even though the new 8"" knife is 'German' stainless steel, we have rust spots and stains on the blade after less than one week's use. We only hand-wash our knives, this knife has never been in a dishwasher. You are better off to spend the extra $50 and get the Pro-S or just keep looking. Don't buy this one. Our Pro-S knives have no spots at all after five years of everyday use. I'm very disappointed in our new 8"" knife."
4,Great knife for a budget,"This knife is not as good as the higher quality henckels knives, but it is still very good for the price, and if you are getting your first chef's knife, or are not a rabid cooking fiend, this would be a good choice."
5,How did I live without it?,"Wonderful knife...would buy this brand over and over again. This chef's knife has changed how I prepare foods. I now look like a TV chef chopping without mishap. Buy it, you will not be disappointed"
5,Fantastic Knife,"I absolutely love this knife: I find it comparable to our sous-chef's 8"" Wusthoff, and actually prefer it now. It's sharp out of the box, has a great heft, and keeps a good edge. Overall, far better than any ""cheap"" knife out there."
1,Good Start Fizzled badly!,"I had to use this book for a class on ""Database Programming"". I took the class to (1) get credit for taking a class and (2) to get more help with Access and VBA for work. This book started out excellent, good explaintion very informative and after about chapter 6 it fizzles, with inconsistancies lack of all the information. Code wasn't included on the cd. They could have shown how to build a form that was needed for the chapter. Everyone in our class was given 100 pts for two modules because the book was incomplete. There were 12 modules in this class.I felt cheated. I don't know who to blame the School or the book writer. I want to blame the school for not using a book that has complete code/explanations.(I have been building databases with Lotus Notes for 7 years. Access is new to me, but programming isn't, so you know my perspective.)"
4,Have you guys bothered to go to their website?,All wrox books ship without CDs. You are supposed to download the code from their website.Shame on you who can't be bothered to visit their site even once!
2,Missing Files Make A Potentially Good Book Mediocre,"I was looking for a book that had theory and enough exercises to improve my fluency in use of VBA. This book has the theory but, due to an obviously extremely flawed production process, fails to include the chapter by chapter sample files on its CD that the authors claim are included. This severely constrains its overall utility. Also, as another reviewer has indicated, the authors sometimes play fast and loose with some of their explanations. I could probably overlook this, if the sample files had been included on the CD or if the publishers respected their customers enough to provide them with a page to download the files. Instead, the publishers simply indicate that they will not help title purchasers.If you want to expand your theoretical understanding of Access 2002 and can get this title at a good discounted rate, you may want to consider purchasing this title. However, if you want both theory and practice, this book has very little to offer."
5,Great advices,I have enjoyed the physical book ever since it was printed and I find myself go back to it then and then before traveling. Now I can bring it along when I travel in my iPad via the Kindle app. Great book and a MUST for those who travel (and those who stay at home as well).
1,DO NOT BUY,"Those are absolutely terrible! very BAD QUALITY, total waste of money.even kids don't want to play with them.Stay away from this article."
1,Very disappointed with this item,"I bought this knife to replace my almost 10 year-old Japanese meat cleaver. After I opened the box of the new J.A Henckels (JAH) meat cleaver, I was surprised that it is so small!I have been using it alternatively with my old knife. I found out:My old knife is still sharper than the JAH. You need to cut the same object to tell the big difference. The old one can cut the frozen meat and the JAH can not do it without a huge effort.My old knife is more comfortable to use. After continuously used JAH for about 45 minutes, the JAH made a blister on my hand between my pointer finger and my thumb. The handle is not smooth.I bought this JAH due to its brand name and high rating. I am using the meat cleavers on daily bases."
4,One of my new FAVs,"It wasn't as wide as I pictured it. I thought it was going to have a bigger flatter surface for shoveling food like a spatula. I'm getting used to it being not so wide and it's actually better like half the time, but if I cooked in a restaurant like I used to with like MASS amounts of food, it wouldn't do at all. You need to cut cut cut cut chop chop slice scoop with your hand and drop in the pan quickly... and this doesn't have the surface area. That gave it a 4. Still a QUALITY knife and I'm proud to add it to my collection."
5,Excellent,"It's a very straightforward manual that tests your analysis skills with very interesting questions... anyone can go through the lab exercises, but can you answer the questions??"
5,bigens ball,"I recently purchased this ball for christmas and was so excited that I had to give it to the kids before christmas arrived! My 13 year old absolutly loves it. All he does is bounce off it while watching television. He tries to see how many bounces he can get before falling off. (11 bounces are the max so far!)The only drawback is that it is big and takes up room. The ball itself is so rubbery and flexable that a single tap can cause it to start bouncing. It is something that the kid in all of us can enjoy, not to mention that you can streach out your back on it after a hard day at work!"
4,Big Ball - Big Fun,"This is a great toy and is a real crowd-pleaser! It's completely safe and is durable (relative to any other inflatable item). As long as you keep it away from sharp or hot objects it is just fine and will last at least one whole summer season of backyard play & abuse. Deflate it and put it away when it won't be used for a long time (it's really big and can easily be inadvertently punctured in a gagage or storage shed). By the way, it inflates just fine with an air compressor (otherwise it takes forever to fill) even though the instructions say not to to do that."
1,Not Very Durable,"I purchased the 50"" Bigens green ball for my son who due to his medical condition needed the ball's therapy badly. My kid is tall but not overweight. He used it from Christmas night(Dec. 25,2004), until Feb. 5, 2005. That morning while he was lying on it, the ball split into two separate pieces. Due to the impact, he flipped over onto his back, and fell quite a distance away to the other side of the room. He was devastatedI purchased the ball after reading the many rave reviews. They all seemed to attest to its durability no matter that the weight of some users, i.e. individuals and parents who tried it out might weigh quite a bit.I have sent emails and have made calls to kbtoys.com I have not as yet received any response, rather a runaround. The price that was paid, (over $40), is too much for such a short time of use."
1,They Should Call It EverShred Instead,"Horrible! That one word sums it up. Horrible on meat, all it does is shred things. Thought maybe it would be good for cutting fresh tomatoes but it doesn't give you a clean slice. STAY AWAY ... don't let the cheap price and Henckels name fool you."
1,Poor quality knife,This knife is garbage do not waist you money. I do not recommend this knife. Look for the ones made in Germany.
1,what you pay for,A little less than so-so. You think it is a bargain because of the name. It's not. Get some good steak knives at your grocer's!
1,Another Psychic Scam Artist?,"In a letter dated Tuesday, August 2, 2005 (my birthday) and received Saturday, August 6, 2005, the letter is identical to the letter reviewed by the (1st) reviewer.The letter claims that The National Enquirer has called me (Shawn Robbins) one of the ""top ten psychics"" living in the world today.She asks $20.00 for a 12 month psychic/astrological report.If you have ever sent in for a psychic/astrological report, from any source in the past, you more than likely are on a national sharing database. I receive leters such as these very frequently during the year.Save your money!"
5,Transformers,A Christmas gift for my son this year that he asked for. He will enjoy this gift and get entertainment from it.
2,Just does not cut it.,I got this book because I am a TF freak. I was expecting a good book and was severely disappointed. Better luck next time.
4,Complete and easy to follow,This is a well written & well organized exercise book. It is easy to follow and reasonable to use. The pictures are clear and concise making it easily accessible.
2,Slow cutting,"I used this on a plaster ceiling and it was not bad in cutting until it hit the metal lath which slowed it down a good deal. With the dust tossed around at 500 RPMs it is a very messy tool though better than a recip saw or rotozip tool. I found that with my remodel type of recessed cans that in the rooms where sheetrock has been installed over plaster in some of the rooms that I needed a larger hole and there is no way to take a 6-3/8"" hole cutter and make a 6-1/2"" hole. The hole size information provided by the manufacturer was also for cans without the air-tight foam tape which takes at least a 1/8"" larger hole cutout to compensate.I did find a great dust shield for use with hole saws. Lets me limit how deep I cut too so I don't cut into a live wire or plumbing.Hole Pro Hole Saw Dust Shield & Arbor Adapter with Cut Depth Control -use with any 1/2"" or 5/8"" threaded hole saw up to 2-1/2"" deep and 6-1/4"" diameter"
1,BIG Waste of Money,Don't waste your money on this book. EVERYtime I've looked to it for information on problems my dogs are experiencing I have found nothing.
1,Another shoddy job by Lemon,"How Cherry Red allow such releases to be part of their roster (albeit under the Lemon subsidiary) is beyond me. I've heard several Lemon CDs now, and they've all clearly betrayed their vinyl origins with audible surface noise. In one case they've even ripped it from a scratched LPThis time around they've done a better job, but check out the fade from track 4. It's all gone quiet, then suddenly the needle jumps and you get the last few seconds of music all over againFar from being furtive about this, they routinely trumpet their releases as ""remasters"", and have made several false and misleading claims about albums being available on CD for the first timeI don't know if Amazon will accept this review, but hope for the sake of honesty and fairness they will. Emails to Lemon about the poor quality of their CDs get no response. With so many reissue labels out there doing a fine job, this company should be ashamed of themselves"
3,"An ""Automatic"" Rip-off from Lemon Recordings!","Just received my copy of ""Automatic Man"" on CD. I slid it in the CD player and was SHOCKED, repeat, SHOCKED when the opening track, ""Atlantis Rising Fanfare,"" began clicking and popping as if I were playing my old, worn-out vinyl copy of ""AM!""The same thing happens on the tracks, ""Right Back Down,"" and ""There's A Way."" I instantly entered the web site address supplied on the cd cover (lemonrecordings.co.uk)to let loose a torrent of pissed-off fury, but guess what? The web site ain't working!Someone must and will pay!"
3,psychedelic funk,"Automatic Man was a spin-off from the Go project, which included a bevy of musicians such as Stomu Yamash'ta, Steve Winwood, Al Demiola, Klaus Schulze and Michael Shrieve, who is the drummer/percussionist here.The album has its moments, and what was side two of the original vinyl disc is better, as side one seems aimed at a late teen/youthful market with slightly naff lyrics.But the musicianship is good, and really takes off with Right Back Down and culminating in the synth and guitar extravanganza of the title track, which also has a superb bass line.The album has elements of Mahavishnu Orchestra circa Inner Worlds, Santana 3 and Return to Forever circa No Mystery.Guitarist Pat Thrall seems to model much of his sound on Jimi Hendrix while keyboardist Bayete lifts elements of space prog and jazz-rock to give texture to this predominantly space-rock adventure.Although uneven, there are some real highlights on this worth visiting. I'd rate it 3.5 stars."
4,Rediscover This!,"If you missed this album the first time around, by all means pick this up! An overlooked gem, it features great tunes in a mix of the classic 70's hard rock and funk styles with just the right amount of prog and space rock. Think upscale-Hawkwind! I don't know what the beef about the sound is. I DOUBT the source is anything but tape, and after a few close listens, could not detect any surface noise in the mix. The volume level of the master is a little low, but as Emeril says, that's what those knobs are for. Kick it up a notch or two and enjoy!"
4,its automatic,"under appreciated stellar line up! although bayete is the ""star"" here, there is enough room for shrieve and thrall to shine through... wish they had done more"
4,spacey funk rock with heavy hendrix influence,this was a great album and i was excited to finally see it available on cd. there is a heavy hendrix influence at work...in bayette's vocals and lyrics and in pat thrall's guitar. the lyrics are somewhat goofy but so was hendrix at times. the musicianship is excellent throughout and coupled with the spacey lyrics give the songs a unique feel. hopefully the second album will also be released on cd.
4,spectacular drumming!,This album has some of the best drumming ever recorded.Although Cheesy lyrics make this album kind of dumb it is still one of the rockin'est albums out there.Mike Shrieve's hands are the most technically proficient of all the rock drummers.If you want to listen how to play a 16th note one hand triplet ride pattern this album has it!A-1 Funk!
5,Automatic Man,Great CD. Wonderful cast of Characters who all went on to produce some interesting music on their own. If downloading the artwork on Apple Itunes forget it. The artwork comes up Atomic man. Buy this cd if you get it cheap.
1,Will not deliver the basics,"Poor construction - You get what you pay for however, you do not receive the basics with this product. Main Problem - When you press down on a function buttom on the front of the unit, the force is applied to the CD and it begins to scratch.Amazon was great with the return process"
1,COBY lacks integrity,"The cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic.The cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use. So I called Coby. They said I'd have to PAY THEM to send me a replacement! My advice, don't bother buying COBY."
3,no sony here,"Apparently they don;t make many of these any more. The quality is good but the unit is missing an important feature that the Sony which it replaced had, namely that your place on the cd was saved when you started again. The instructions don;t mention this and they don;t respond to my emails so I assume you are expected to write down the time for next play."
1,quit working after 4 CDs over 2 weeks,"I used mine for less than the time it took to deplete one pair of AA Sony 2500 mAh batteries and to listen to 4 CDs of a recorded book. It quit working with just an ""Err"" message showing, so I cleaned the CD, but it would not start loading that or any other CD. The disc spins, the laser moves on its track, but it doesn't even start playing. Sometimes it does eventually read ""Err,"" but more often it just sits with ""---"" showing on the display. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,faulty equipment,"I purchased the COBY CX CD646 Super Slim CD player with 60 second Asp and car kit.I wish I could tell you that it worked well, but I cannot get it to work at all. As far as I can tell the cord to the cigerette lighter does not work. I have not had the time to return or communicate the problem. I am not positively sure that the power cord is the problem but I don't have to skills to test anything else. I did try a different power cord and it worked for another type of settup. I am not sure how to return the cord, or should I just send the whole mess back?"
1,Didn't do what I needed,"I bought the Coby with car kit for one purpose -- to listen to audio books. I was replacing a Sony player that was worn out. I discovered that when I had turned off the player at my destination in the car, and turned it on again that the player started over again on track 1. Not good for listening to a book. I called Coby to see if there was a setting I was missing as my Sony player started where it left off, and they said it would always start over on Track 1 after being turned off. I returned it and may have 10% deducted for restocking. I'll pay more and get a Sony."
2,Thanks to AMAZON! No thanks to COBY.,"This player has garnered decent reviews, so I thought I'd try it. The first unit sent to me was unusable because of skipping. I had purchased the extended warranty -- but Amazon's extended warranty defers to COBY's warranty for the first year, so you have to deal with COBY directly. I found that one could hardly ever get through to Coby, and when I did, they had to consult and call me back, so I ended up having to try to get through three different times, only to be told I'd have to PAY TO SHIP THE BAD UNIT BACK TO THEM -- which would cost almost as much as the unit. THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON. When I called to express my discontent, the Amazon customer relations staffer quicly and easily sent me another unit. THANK YOU. Because the second one works without skipping. It sounds okay, it does the basics. There is no ""resume play"" function, however, which is annoying."
3,Did not like this product,Coldy slim CD player skips badly if you do not hold it still. Would not recommend.
2,A disappointment,"This knife has a nice feel to it and is easy to use, good weight distribution, and great grip.Honestly, this knife was dull after a week and the blade looked beaten. All it cut was onions and tomatoes that week and the weak performance came as a surprise. Although it does have a nice feel to it, I will not buy any more knives from JA Henckels but have switched to the slightly more expensive but noticeably cleaner-cutting R.H. Forschner by Victorinox.Personally, I do not always trust neg. reviews but my advice is to purchase this knife with a return option and then try it out for yourself. I assume if you invest time and patience into sharpening it may be worth it but it went dull to quickly for me to have faith in the brand."
5,The Best Knife i've ever used!,"This knife takes an edge well, although it really dosen't need sharpening. It has a good balance and weight, and is easy to clean and mantain. This is an ideal knife for people ranging from Master cheif to Cullinary Arts Student. A perfect gift for the cook in your family"
4,"Great backup, especially for the price!","For a twenty-dollar knife, you cannot go wrong with this Henckels. It feels fairly balanced in the hand, and the grip is comfortable. This knife also has a full tang, when other knives in this price range do not. I use this as a backup to my more expensive knives. It comes in handy when I have guests helping in the kitchen, and I don't want them using my Hattori.The downsides? The blade is thin, stamped steel, and there isn't a bolster or a guard. The blade sharpens easily, but it also gets dull quickly. In this price range, though, I don't think you can do much better."
1,"8"" Goodgrip MV55-Pro",We liked this knife very much until the handle broke off while cutting pizza. Used for about 3 mos & never put in the dish washer or left submerged in water. I found the the knife required little shapening as the blade was hard & that portion in the handle was also hardened unfortunately and broke due to a brittle fracture. How do I get a warranty replacement?
3,The old episodes are better,"Aside from the animated nudity, which was interesting, these episodes are very strange and not very funny. I'd rather watch the old ones, but, maybe that's because I saw them as a kid and am being nostalgic."
3,only for the hard core fans,"I was hoping for a bit more of some lost episodes, and while I got the episodes, i wasnt impressed with the work. Not for children, as it says, but unless you are a die hard ren and stimpy fan, it may not be worth it. It was ok and funny in some parts, alot of dirty jokes to be dirty I feel."
3,A different spin on a classic cartoon: I guess its ok,"I guess this review would be slightly jaded considering I'm more accustomed to the Ren and Stimpy I knew as a young teenager, although this would have probably appealed to me more at that age, I cant help but feel disconnected to the characters after watching this.true, they are done in a more adult context which they were always intended to be, but I cant help but feel some of it is a little overboard.If you are a die-hard ren and stimpy fan, I recommend this to you. I personally think the overt sexual connotations and abstract story lines arent for me.If you are a fan of the careless, stupid and somewhat childish ren and stimpy, then i dont suggest this two disc set.If you are just curious... well... by all means... go for it!"
2,Disappointing,"The lure of new episodes was too great for me not to buy this and i'm disappointed that i did.Not funny, stories that seemed like a monkey on crack wrote them and animation that pales in comparison to the original.Ren sounds okay but the guy doing Stimpy just doesn't have it.If you do decide to get this, skip through the John K intros...they are WAY too long and WAY too boring!!"
1,Weird and Stupid,"Yep - the previous review was right on the money. I didn't care to see Stimpy treated like dirt. The episodes drag on and on and on - they are much longer than the earlier incarnations. The 'sex' part refers to the first episode which has a few bouncing boobs/ balls (kinda funny), then drags on forever. The other episodes don't have the 'sex' part, but do drag on forever after the plot dies. John K + Weird Al comment on each episode(for a long time)and one must fast forward through it just to get to the cartoon.These haven't ruined Ren & Stimpy for me - there are better seasons/ collections though. Not worth the money, unless you get them for free."
4,MMM... sillieness,"Was pretty raw. This was the effort that spike tv picked up and ran...it left no tougne in your cheek, and if it did you chawed it off and it fell out on the tv room floor"
2,Aimed tword adults but it goes way to over the top,Its like my title says. It goes tword adults but goes to over the top. Some of it is funny but then you have giant turds and crap that i just dont find funny boohoo for me
1,stinky,"can I say I love the originals better then this, I watch everything basically, Simpsons, family guy, south park, Cleveland show, squidbillies, Metalocalypse, American dad-the list goes on and on. I have few complaints with all these shows, with saying that, Ren and stimpy the lost episodes or adult party or whatever its called is just bad, and mean spirited above all. There is nothing good about it, I found myself grossed out by its overindulges of filth. It is a judgment from on high that this got canned."
3,John K. gets an passing grade,"First let me state that I am a real fan of John K. and his creations. With that out of the way, this 2 disc set is far from sacrocanct. Example: the poorly designed and executed ""Hairy Lifeguard"" in the first cartoon ""Naked Beach Frenzy"" overshadowed the otherwise delicious cartoon boob action. All six of the shorts (and not so shorts) on this release have similar good and bad points but there's plenty of room for improvement. I was expecting a better level of craftsmanship and storytelling after all this time."
1,How sad,Ok I don't know why they had to make ren and stimpy even more sick and nasty because I think they were a gross enough cartoon to begin with. I love ren and stimpy the way it was supposto be CLASSIC and I think they should have left it the way it was. I remember when spike tv existed with ren and stimpy I was so happy but when I first watched one of their adult episodes I was disqusted how they were just homosexuals and the other unacceptable adult humor. But thankfully they have the sacred classics (which I taped 6hr episodes on 3 tapes) on spike tv which im sticking to and not some overrated adult version of what is not a sacred cartoon. The adult version blows it's not for me at all and I give this piece of crap 0 stars.
3,Very different,"The humor is much more adult, the animation is different, and its not as wacky, but it will make you chuckle"
5,Really funny,"Really cool DVD, funny as hell and solves a lot of misteries that we might had from the regular seasons, the homosexuality between those 2 becomes a lot more obvious here..."
3,Missing Something Here...,"With the new animation technologies used in this collection, Ren and Stimpy looked cheap and non elaborated. I really missed the drawing quality of the earlier shows.But not everything it's so bad. ""Ren Seeks Help"" and Shampoo Master from the Beach episode stand up as the best of this collection."
2,Almost like John K. forgot what made the show funny...,"The original Ren and Stimpy shows under John K were hilarious, not because of the gross-outs and adult content they were able to get away with, but because the strict controls of Nickelodeon forced them to work the gags in through back-handed means.Turning John K and co. loose and letting them be as naughty as they want to be takes all the Joy out of Ren and Stimpy. The antagonism between the creators and the studio is lost and as a result most of the humor is gone as well.The animation is stellar though, far cleaner than anything produced in the original run which is why this gets 2 stars instead of 1.The DVD itself is mastered poorly, fronted with 4 previews for worthless junk I'm not interested in. You can't stop them or menu out of them. You can chapter skip past them, but you must do a chapter skip for each item. Disabling remote options prevents this disc from getting a 3 star review."
1,Not worth the time or money,"When I saw this DVD on the rack and saw ""LOST"" episodes, I was elated thinking that this was old unaired episodes. I was very disapointed when I found out it was an uncensored ""adult, grown-up"" cartoon. The show is not funny, just crass. Having no boundries of censorship is what killed it. I am going to take this back and trade it in for the old original cartoon, the one that was good."
3,buy at your own risk,i bought two sets of these one for me and one for a friend but the sticky pads for the clips that hold the wires to the wall don't hold the clips to the wall for very long
2,Picture doesn't match description,This review is only related to the accuracy of the advertised amazon product (it is not intended for the product itself):Beware that the picture does not match the description. Read the fine print for the exact product information.
5,Excellent knives. A true bargain.,"I love these knives. They are heavier than the Wusthof Grand Prix line that I looked at, and for not being made in Germany, they are remarkably well-made.They are fully forged and razor sharp.I compared these side by side to several sets of Henckels and Wusthof knives, particularily the Henckels Pro S made in Solingen, and I could not tell a major difference.They might not be top notch, but they are certainly nice enough for anything I'll ever need them for."
2,Well balanced and pretty...but dull. Get the 4 star instead,"These knives were really nice looking and felt good in the hand...much like the Henckels Pro S line, but they were not very sharp. This could have just been a bad set, but that may be due to lower standards at the manufacturing facility in Spain. I recommend spending the extra few bucks and getting the Henckels Four Star knives made at the original facility in Germany. When I got the Four Star set they were razor sharp, felt great and worked beautifully. There is a reason the International line is so much cheaper..."
5,great help,"This book is a great help for those of us who are language challenged. I went from being a very inexperienced spanish speaker to someone who can read and understand spanish text. As I learn more, I am getting a bit more willing to speak to native speakers and feel I am on my way to my goal of becoming bilingual. Great resource!"
2,Poor customer support.,"Hi, I have one card installed in a gateway machine, and another USB homelink phoneline connected to the laptop. I was able to get this working in an hour. After a few months, the card connected to the gateway stoped responding, and it seems it had a hardware problem. I called up the linksys customer service about 5 times now, and they were not able to issue me a RMI number to get this card replaced. I later got another card for a cheaper rate to use until I get this replaced if possible. If you buy this, you are on your own.. dont expect any customer support."
1,hmmm....,"I believe Rhonda Kelley wants to educate & encourage... However, I am sad to say she missed the mark here. Three of us gave this a go & it was a flop. We found ourselves questioning why it seemed everything was about works & nothing was about relationship. The overall content was all works :( I respectfully suggest you try another study."
1,LOOKOUT: It doesn't work with IBM,I've used KVMs over the years and this is the first one I've seen that doesn't work with IBM PCs. The manual suggests it's IBM's fault. Returning this POS.
2,"OK, but Belkin product better","I bought both the linksys and belkin 4-port kvm products. On the linksys, I had problems with mice being recognized and having mouse clicks missed. On bootup, I could not have my laptop attached if it was not on port 1, since it would then think the mouse was not attached no matter what mouse or trackball I used.I have none of these problems with the Belkin product. Also, from an ergonomic point of view, the belkinproduct is set up much better, with the cables all attaching from the back (except the console mouse/keyboard cables). Also, the belkin product is less expensive.Obviously, I would suggest forgetting the linksys and buying the belkin kvm."
1,Linksys disappoints,"I had been using a Linksys 2 port KVM switch for years without a single problem so when it came time to add another computer, I naturally went with the Linksys 4 port model. Unfortunately, the 4 port model doesn't work nearly as well. The softkey controls on the 2 port model was a simple double click of any ctrl key. The 4 port model is a confusing and often times unsuccessful ctrl+alt+shift+<number>. Not only that, the keyboard and mouse appear to 'blink' out pretty regularly. Mostly the mouse, which will often freeze. This is quite annoying and I'm ready to throw this piece of product right into the trash bin. And I'm being nice!"
4,Good value,"this KVM switch works fine with all the OS I have (Win98, NT, 2000,Linux,etc). On one particular NT computer, if nothing is showing on the foreground, I noticed a very very faint ""wave/rainbow"" patterns in the background. You will need to buy KVM PS2 cables for this unit. it comes with no cable kits. Overall, it's a terrific value for the money"
2,Doesn't pass extra mouse buttons!,"BEWARE: This KVM doesn't pass the roll-up, roll-down and the thumb button on a Logitech MouseMan+ through to the computers. I would assume it has problems with the new Microsoft roller mice too.If you don't need these, it's a nice box, but if you EVER need them, you'll keep cursing it until you replace it."
5,When men were men,"What's the appeal of a show produced fifty years ago about an era one-hundred-and-fifty years ago? How about that it depicts a time when men were men. Unlike the bawling, cussing submarine commanders of today's movies, or the whining, conflicted urban singles of today's television, Rawhide's leading men were as strong as steel and as good as gold. I can't think of a better example of compassion and strength than the character of Gil Favor, trail boss. Sure there's blazing guns, but there's also blazing saddles. These men can really ride.If that's not enough, how about an early performance by Clint Eastwood, before he loses his lips to the teeth-baring characters he plays in later years? Either way, Rawhide is a can't miss."
5,"""Head'em up; move'em out!""","If you're a Rawhide fan, this set is as good as it gets. While you have to remember the time period in which ""Rawhide"" was filmed (late 1950's and early 1960's) because the stories and some of the costumes aren't up to today's standards, it's the standard by which all old westerns are measured. I'll be looking forward to season two."
4,rawhide the complete first season,This video came on time as stated and was in good condition. I have found no flaws in any of the discs to date. I would reccommend this for any one who miss's the old westerns.
5,oustanding western!,These are the Columbia House disks as far as I can tell (?) This is a great series! Buy it!
5,RAWHIDE & HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL,VERY HAPPY ! NOTHING LIKE OLD MEMORIES !! GREAT SERVICE! PROBABLY ORDER MORE IN THE FUTURE ! PRICES ARE VERY FAIR .THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES
3,the wait is over,"All it took was the 2:30am syndication slot on my local independent channel back home for me to get hooked on this show as a 16 year old. How it caught my eye back then was a mystery to me, but the years make it clear why it's my favorite all-time show. It's just a pinnacle of American television in my book. And over the years, the offerings for the show on video have been notoriously few and lacking in quality. So much so that I paid an arm and a leg for an import version of the Special Selection releases in Japan on laserdisc (don't ask how much I paid!). There's just something plain wrong with seeing Japanese subtitles below a mileage sign for the next town as the main group leave the cattle for a break. After years of asking for it, now the show has finally been transferred to DVD. All they need to do now is release the other seasons."
2,great show bad dvd's,I bought these for my Dad Before i gave them to him i checked them out 1 of the disk would not play. sent them back got a new set same disk would not play sent those back did not get a new set as i feared the same results.
1,"No subtitles, no audio in other languages, NO SALE!!!!","Well, everybody wants all seasons to be released and we all know how it works. Not enough sales = no more seasons coming out.Ok, I still don√±'t understand why all DVD's don't include subtitles. I know audio in different languages can be hard to find because maybe not all the seasond were dubbed in Spanish ( I take my mother tongue as an example). BUt why not include English and Spanish subtitles???Is it too hard to do it? The big problem here is that you are losing a lot of potencial buyers that don't understand English very well and need a little help.I don√±t have any problem with English but I don't buy the DVD's only for me but for the whole family. For that reason audio/subtitles are very important.I also think that the lack of subtitles is also a sign of no respect for the hearing impaired in any country"
5,Great water pump,"Slight upgrade from the water pump that came on my RV, but this one is more quite and has a consistent flow of water. Highly recommend."
5,Perfect Replacement,"This pump looked exactly like the original. It was a easy install. Works like a champ, and provides plenty of pressure."
4,Was a little more noisy than I expected,"Works just fine pumping water but I bought a higher model pump than OEM, and was hoping it would be quieter."
3,"odd game, odd play","Jojo's bizzare adventure is a very strange game. the closest thing I can think of that even remotely is similiar to this is darkstalkers (also made by capcom I believe) the controls are hard to get a hold of, especially on the dreamcast controller, and the graphics are not up to the machines capabilities. (In fact the graphics are very similar to those used on the saturn version of darkstalkers.) the play istelf is quite limited, combos and special moves are difficult to pull off, although they are funny at some times. The horrible quality of the japanese dub (japanese dub is better!) makes the game even more enjoyable and makes you feel like you are playing an import game. all together, the package scores about a 3.3."
4,One of the most obscure fighting games to come from Capcom...next to Power Stone,"What can I say? This game is a bit off-kilter and rather off-the-wall, but it's still reasonably fun. The graphics reek of excellent detail. The soundtrack is amazing. The characters are very unique, as expected from the interesting manga the game comes from. However, I think it's the gameplay that tends to make things get a little crazy. I think it's a cross between Street Fighter, Darkstalkers, and the Marvel games. The ""Stand"" system is the games bread-and-butter, but it can also be very constricting, as you only have 3 attack buttons, and they are a weak, medium, and strong attacks. Then again, Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom is the same way, and, like this game, is very obscure with its references. However, that doesn't take away from its solid gameplay. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for a change of pace in fighting games."
1,If you are a Street Fighter fan....DO NOT BUY THIS,"I got it for 10 bucks and it's still not worth it. The graphics aren't good, the characters are just stupid, and it's not fun."
4,Clarification,"Just to make a point, this is not an album of new material. It is a collection of songs from the ""Fear,"" ""Slow Dazzle"" and ""Helen of Troy"" albums (plus ""Mary Lou""). It has some terrific things on it, including the title track and ""Leaving It Up to You"" with its reference to Sharon Tate, and an anguished version of ""Heartbreak Hotel"" which makes one realize the meaning of the words, if they're taken seriously. But if you like the hard-rocking Cale, the three original albums are all good ones."
3,Henckels Intl. Eversharp useful for slicing tomatoes,"The price was right, but I didn't realize it had a serrated edge (eversharp). Still, it works good slicing vegetables like tomatoes."
5,Excellent,"Every song should have been rated in the top 20. One of the original popular appeal soul artists, it's strange Mimms never achieved the prominence of the Sam Cooke or Jerry Butler. The original ""Cry Baby"" definitely outshines the Janis Joplin version."
4,Very Enjoyable,Garnet Mimms does a great job exposing his soul in his music. It's a rich offering that relaxes your inner self and brings you to an atmosphere of peace. Highly Recommended.
1,We Got Rid of Ours,"We purchased this ball and regretted it. While the kids had a lot of fun with it initially, it was too easy for them to get reckless with it. My daughter was running after the ball and jumped on it, rolled with the ball and landed right on her head. Luckily, she was not seriously hurt -- but it gave us a huge scare and we got rid of the ball."
3,Not for Pets,"I bought this ball after reading another review saying it was suitable for dogs. My dog popped this ball within 10 minutes. Don't believe reviews saying dogs can play with it, it's no true."
