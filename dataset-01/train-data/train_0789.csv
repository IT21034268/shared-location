3,Young Bleed Rise Through The Ranking -CD-,"This is no where near his best, but it would not hurt to have this in your hoodrap collection. Young Bleed is honest about who he is and what living in his community is like. Very believable talk not too supermanish. Musical production fits the era but has a slightly different style. Get it if you like Young Bleeds previous stuff like Concetration Camp or No Limit Records libraries. Condition was good when delivered."
2,Incorrect description,"This item is not described truthfully, it claims to be the 18/10 version but according to the Knork websitethe matte finish product only comes in 18/0 Stainless that will get rust spots. Be warned you will not receivewhat they claim to be selling!"
1,the worst book i have ever read,"this book is by far the worst motivation book i have ever read. it is so horribly written, i could hardly make myself finish it. he skips from one topic and then to another topic, and you never have any idea where he is going with any of it. if you are an adult, you should read adult books. this is not an adult book, it is a badly written book on a 4th grade reading level. my suggestion: don't waste your money!"
5,Randy Rhaods: The Legend,"Randy Rhoads was the best. He could do anything. Rhoads Will always be remembered by this tribute album, and the other albums he was featured on. This is some of the greatest Rhoads stuff ever, and the only live Rhoads with Ozzy. Rhoads was my biggest inspiration to play guitar. Along with Zakk Wylde, and Tonny Iommi, he ranks the highest. I just wish he could've lived longer so that the people that now dont know Rhoads would have. Rhoads in anyones eyes, and everyones eyes, and in my eyes, is a legend."
5,Long live Randy Rhoads...,"Randy Rhoads was the greatest guitarist that music has ever seen. I love Hendrix as much as the next guy, but Randy could have smoked him any day of the week. He is sorely missed, especially nowadays when we have bands like Matchbox 20 and The Offspring busting out with 3 cords in a song and no solos. Randy shows us all that if you want to play an instrument, stay the hell away from the guitar because he has conquered it. This is his greatest album, unfortunatly out of only three with Ozzy and two with Quiet Riot. The fact that he died so young is a real tragedy, he will be missed by all who follow him..."
3,Good live album.,"This is a good live album from Ozzy Osbourne. Randy Rhoads does a great job with the guitar playing. The production of Tribute is satisfying. The disc consists of fourteen tracks. Three of these tracks are Black Sabbath songs. The guys do a good job of performing ""Goodbye to Romance."" That would have to be favorite live track. I'm somewhat disappointed with the live version of ""Revelation (Mother Earth)."" The keyboard work doesn't sound as moving and distinct as it does on the studio version. That aside, the rest of the songs are good. It would have been nice if ""Tonight"" and ""You Can't Kill Rock and Roll"" had been included, though. Tribute's musicianship is very good. The liner notes are really impressive and informative. All of the photos are interesting. Tribute is pretty cool."
5,"One of the most bad-ass, soulful, electric blues guitarists","This album is must-have for any lover of blues, electric or otherwise. This guy was an amazing, soulful guitarist, and one of the best slide guitarists in history. Some great, rare tracks with Arethra Franklin, Wilson Pickett, plus some old faves from the Allman Brothers. Try ""Goin Down Slow""--A number that starts slow and sad, but just rips it up. This song always brings tears of joy to my eyes. One wonders what Duane would have been capable of if it had not been for that errant peach truck...."
3,A dust covered Gem,"The musicologist in me loves this compilation. But as I grow older I'm loosing interest in this genre. I absolutely loved it when it first came out (on vinyl), we hung on every note Duane played back when he was alive and well. After his death, we hung on every note he had played, hence this release filled a void of material that was rarely heard or languishing in some bargain record bin at the K-mart. Remember those? Three quarters of my record collection came from there. But I digress. Duane Allman was a musical force in the up and coming days of late 60's and 70's rock. He was a guitarist's guitarist and for quite a while only guitarists appreciated his prowess on the instrument. IF you're a devotee of the Duane Allman guitar society then by all means -- this one's for you. If not -- go with the more mainstream selections, which featured Duane in a more prominent setting."
3,This album was originally released in the EARLY eighties.,"This album was originally released in the EARLY eighties. Though there is nothing wrong with retro this particular album is not a great achievement for such a great band like Mecano. They definitely got better with time. I give it three stars instead of 0ne because of track 7 ""Aire"". That song alone is worth the dough."
1,But I thought...,... that we were at war with Eurasia? We have always been at war with Eurasia. Or was it Eastasia?
5,A Great Story Told Well,"Louise Erdrich is among my favorite authors. She weaves moving, human plots together with the intricacy of a well-told poem. Her landscapes make one gasp and her characters make one believe. So it is through this biased lens that I picked up Four Souls, read it, and also loved it.Fleur Pillager walks to Minneapolis to kill John James Mauser. That's the premise, but along the way she devises a punishment worse than death. See Mauser stole her family's land and clear cut the prized trees, leaving her family as poor as destitute as the rest of the Ojibwe in Northern Minnesota. What's her plan? Nurse Mauser back to health from his poison-gas induced illness and get him to fall in love with her.It's such an accomplished story told beautifully that I really can't add to it in a longer review without giving away more of its magic. Please, read this one, and Tracks the novel about Fleur Pillager that precedes it.- CV Rick, February 2008"
3,A Joke on itself,"At the end of Louise Erdrich's Tracks, the fearsome, fetching, dangerously divine Fleur Pillager--a Chippewa earth mother so idolized by the author as to seem a form of creative self-caricature--finally walks away from her beloved patch of Dakota forest, abandoning it to the whim and destruction of white loggers and tribal sellouts. Erdrich's latest finds the indomitable Fleur trudging all the way to Minneapolis, where she hires on as a laundress in the home of a wealthy timber baron simply in order to take his life in revenge. Fortunately or not, however, Erdrich doesn't like her dishes served cold, and soon a bedroom farce breaks out amid the tragedy. Thus Four Souls juxtaposes the silly and the somber, the ribald and the elegiac. Nuance heeds the DO NOT DISTURB sign and generally stays away."
5,Simple changes in our lives can make a big difference.,"The Better World Handbook is an amazing guide to healthy everyday living. It has information on how to better ourselves individually and how we can include ourselves in the community to make it a better place for everyone. It has a great shopping guide to choose the best stores, who are the most environmentally and socially friendly, to shop at. Brett Johnson is an excellent sociologist and writer. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make a positive change, without having to live in a tree."
3,"Pretty good, but not great game","I was a little disappointed with this game. My 3 year old played a couple of times & got bored with it. It didn't seem to have as much that grabbed her interest as other Bear games did. She will still play it occassionally, but it doesn't hold her interest as other games have."
2,Boring!,"From other reviews, it seems as if you either love this game or hate it. We're in the 'hate it' category. The characters talk SO MUCH - it takes forever to get to the games. Some areas have very little instruction and our 4 year old has no idea what he is supposed to do, so he just ends up clicking anything and listening to more TALKING. He either ends up frustrated and walking away or playing the only game he can figure out over and over and over. I gave it 2 stars because there is one game our son likes to play that has taught him a little bit of mouse control. If we hadn't received it as a gift (and need to keep it around in case the gift-giver ever wants to see it), I'd be checking in to the satisfaction guarantee. This game is terrible. There are so many great software titles out there for this age group (the Reader Rabbits, and Blue's Clues ABCs for example), I wouldn't waste my $ on this one."
2,Too Slow,"My 3 yo loves the Bear, so I thought this would be a great software game for him. However, I was mistaken. The game takes way to long to get into, with songs that you must wait through to get to the playing. It also won't let you click through until the songs or talking are over. It's extremely boring at times and more like a video for the computer than a game. It does come with a satisfaction guarantee, which I'm looking into - I'm that disappointed."
2,Doesn't keep time,"Purchased this radio mainly for it's looks and price. Radio quality isn't the best, the cd player is ok. Our biggest complaint is that it doesn't keep time. We set it to match the other clocks in the house and within a couple weeks it is 10+ minutes fast. I will reset it and again within a couple weeks it is off again. Overall, not the best quality."
1,Non-Functioning Display,"After only 3 weeks, one of the led's in the display has quit working and a second keeps slowly fading in and out, so I am sure it will quit working before long. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. Unfortunately, I don't have the time or the paperwork to return it, so I am stuck with a semi-functioning display.I do like the design and the small footprint on my desk. But, if it doesn't work properly, a good design is useless."
2,"Have to agree with everyone else--decent radio, bad clock.","I really don't understand how anyone can put out a clock that keeps time this poorly. My son's Yoda watch keeps better time. It gains five minutes a week, which is ridiculous, and it's hard to reset the time. And yes, the numbers are far too bright and will keep you awake at night."
2,CD Player doesn't work,"I recently ordered this and the CD player only played 3 tracks before failing. The clock, alarm and radio seem fine, but after repeated attempts I've given up on the CD player."
1,Don't buy this product,"We had all the same problems listed in previous reviews. This model is a dud. We purchased it for about $18 at Target, it was on clearance. Now I know why. Nothing on it works!"
2,Wrong decision...,"I may try selling mine ASAP as long as it is still worth anything. I had it now for a few months and should have followed my first instinct when I took it out of the box. It is too small and quite uncomfortable since there is no real grip. The picture quality is pretty good as long as you are not using the flash or the macro feature. The LCD is already scratched though I am anal with my equipment (I still have and love my 1980s A series camera which still looks almost new though it has been around the world with me a few times).By looking at the prices now, I am disappointed that I did not go with the G6 or one of the Olympus SLR style cameras but fell for the ""portability/cuteness"" factor: size DOES matter. So, if you are into photography, buy a bigger and better camera. If you need a point and shoot, buy a cheap Olympus."
1,I was happy until the LCD cracked,"It's one of those things...you never think it's going to happen to you until it does. For the price of this camera, it should break after using it for 3 weeks. It was fine one minute and then the next it wasn't. Quite shocking. I don't care how convenient the size...dealing with Canon to get it fixed has been a nightmare."
4,A decent digital camera,"I bought my SD500 about a month ago and then I used it to take several shots at different times and locations, morning, afternoon and evening, indoor, outdoor, cloudy day, sunny day, close shot, landscape shot, by using the preset scenary modes... My overall impression is that picture quality is quite good at representing color and details. Up to now, the only minor shortcoming is that the default setting of exposure makes all pictures taken look darker than reality. The exposure setting of +2/3 ~ +1 can compensate the brightness."
5,One of the best,I purchased this camera about a month ago and I have been very impressed. I made the mistake a couple years ago by purchasing a camera from Hewlett Packard: what a horrible idea! The Canon cameras have been very excellent and surpass HP design by lightyears!The SD500 is a smart buy and very easy for anyone to use. I recommend any Canon cameras that use the Lithium Ion Battery Packs because they do not die all of a sudden and you won't have to recharge them often. I've yet to have to recharge mine in the month I've had it. This is the best camera I've ever laid my hands on and you should buy it if you are looking for a new one!
4,Good camera for the money,"I bought this camera for $249 new which marked down from the $499 retail. This was an older model as the new models had just come out.For the money this is a good camera, but I am very particular and was not blown away. The images are good, but I was expecting more vibrance. Colors are a bit weak. It will not take a focused shot indoors unless the flash is on, and the flash is way to bright for closer shots. The image is often over exposed, and I find myself placing a piece of paper over the flash to get more of a correct shot. I upgraded from a Canon A40 2 megapixel camera (AMAZING CAMERA!), and the images are very similar in quality, except the new SD500 captures them bigger, having the 7 megapixel chip, hence a little better detail.I do like the small size, and the battery lasts a long time between charges. Holds lots of pictures with the 1 gig card I purchased seperatly. The video quality is quite good for a still camera."
4,"Great camera, broke once","This is a great camera. My wife is taking pics all the time and the quality is very good considering the camera is over 2 years old (ancient in terms of technology). It recently broke and we had it repaired by Canon for around $120. If would not have cost much more to replace it, but my wife feels that it is so easy to use, she didn't want to take the chance on a new model."
4,"Hiss, Boo, Blah and Wow","Excellent camera with a really annoying flaw.I was forwarned by the forums at dpreview.com that movie audios have an annoying hiss. Sure enough, my unit does too. If you are putting value in the movie feature, be sure to audition the camera before buying.Update: 9 April 2005 - This camera is taking some really excellent outdoor photos. No problem there at all. However, in hindsight, I'd rather have the SD400. I'm a traveler and thus prefer the noticably smaller and lighter SD400. If you intend to keep a camera in your pocket all the time, consider the SD400.Update: 20 August 2005 - Disaster. The flash has stopped working. Canon support has been really excellent. The unit must be repaired. Unfortunately, I'm traveling and Canon doesn't offer an international repair. I must wait until I return to the US. I'm able to take non-flash photos. Outdoor photos continue to be really terrific. I would buy this camera again."
3,"good features, but faulty battery","I have always been pleased with canon products, but this camera and/or battery has caused me problems. If I haven't used it in a while, a week or so, it won't turn on. I have to pop the battery out and back in again to get it to start up. It does this even when the battery is fully charged. It may just have a faulty battery, but I won't know for sure until I am able to purchase a new battery.Other than that I really like this simple and compact camera."
5,Absolutely outstanding,"The color reproduction, clarity, ease of use, portability are excellent. I'm 100% satisfied; strongly endorse this camera."
5,great camera!,"This is great camera. The pictures are very clear. It is easy to download to the computer. The batterie last long, and charging it is fast. This camera is worth every penny and more. The SD card is easy to remove and put back. It is light weight and small enough to fit in a pocket. Love this camera."
4,Awesome camera - tons of quality,"Nothing wrong with this camera. I've had it Since Jan 06 and it's great. I have it set for 3 settingsi use most, first switch is regular, 2nd switch is a no flash setting that won't ruin night shots where you don't want a flash and can keep steady, and the 3rd postion is for night photos with flash. the last of course is for video- and i think the video and audio is just fine.All my pictures have fab color. I've even tried the sepia setting, and the black and white setting.What I don't like is the red eye reduction. Can't quite get that one!"
1,Fragile,"I give this camera 1 star in honor of how many weeks it worked before it needed expensive repair. It took great photos but after one week of light use the LCD screen failed. I returned it to Canon and they charged me $155 for ""pressure damage"" not covered by warranty. The camera was never dropped and the most extreme condition it was exposed to was being placed in my shirt pocket. I have since read of numerous other reports of LCD problems on this camera from other users. This is my third Canon camera and until this experience I had been impressed with their cameras. If considering the purchase of the SD500, I would caution buyer beware."
4,Problems with red eye?,"I love this camera...I picked it over the SD550 because it has a longer battery life, and the SD550 didn't offer much more than a larger LCD screen and a larger price tag. However, I have noticed a lot of pictures with red eyes, in spite of using the red eye feature. Another friend with the same camera doesn't seem to have this problem, so I'm not sure if it is something I'm doing. However, aside from that, I love the pictures. The same size of the camera means that I can carry it in the pocket of my jeans and have it readily available anytime my kids are ready to do something cute!"
4,Great little Camera,"Bought for my daughter for Christmas. Went back to buy a second for my wife and price had increased everywhere over $60. Bought her the Fuji F30 after a lot of work. Both are good cameras. The Fuji is clearly better in low light (by a lot). The Canon battery can be removed to be charged, but not the Fuji - you have to plug the whole camera in.Overall both are very good - no issues with either."
5,Cannon SD500 Digital ELph Review,"Works like a charm. Instructions are well constructed and effective; even first timers can make crisp, full color pictures with a minimum of concern for outcome. It's user friendly, easily portable and much appreciated in this household.Thanks Amazon & Canon!!"
1,Garbage Camera,I'll keep it short. This thing is so counterintuitive and difficult to use...It just sucks. The battery goes out so fast that even with a back-up battery in my case I am always out of juice with it. I could never recommend this camera. Make another choice. Peace
1,Exceptional value,"Small size of camera is great for travel, pictures are crisp, and camera is easy to use. I love it."
1,Offer the item at a great price then cancel your order,"I was excited to buy but right after i ordered the camera the order was cancelled by the seller, and my money was refunded. Don't bother e-mailing, they will not respond, nor will you hear anything about the sale of the item again. Horrible."
3,"Nice Camera, but Canon will not support.","I have the SD500 and it is fantastic. However, about 15 months into use, I got the E18 error when zooming. Canon will NOT fix under warranty, even though amny other users are experiencing the same issue. I have owned many cameras and never have found such a poor level of support."
4,"So great, I'm buying it again.","I bought this camera in February, and it really did a great job in so many different situations.Unfortunately, I lost it this past September and have been kicking myself ever since. I will be purchasing the exact same camera again.Excellent features include:easy to usesmallgood quality (as long as they aren't EXTREMELY close) picturesI like the software that came with the cameragood accessories, esp. the camera caseclear LCD screengreat options for picture takingGood features include:fast shutter speed, although not quite fast enough. I'd like to take more pictures at a faster repetition but cannot with this cameraI recommended this camera to my best friend who is a lighting designer for retail spaces (Dolce & Gabbana, for instance) and he gives it an excellent review as well, so I know it is good in all types of light and for professional purposes."
1,LCD cracked,"This camera was fantasic for the first 3 weeks of use until I pull it out of the case, turn it on and see a white screen with a big purple blob in the middle. Yes, the LCD is cracked. You may have seen the earlier reviews of thias model and for the SD200, which suffered the same problem. My suggestion for those of you looking at the Canon range of cameras just type ""Canon cracked LCD"" into google! Canon state it is the result of an impact/pressure damage so it's not under covered by the warranty."
2,LCD cracked after 8 days,"I bought the first SD500 4 month ago, and had it for 8 days, when the LCD cracked for no apparent reason, unfortunately I bought the diving case also, so after reading Canon didn't cover the LCD on warranty, I bought another one, but since then it's come out the LCD are very fragile, so that might have been a big mistake."
4,Lexmark Printer Cartridges,The printer cartridges arrived in a reasonable timeframe and were exactly what were ordered. The price was fair and we really appreciated the free shipping with the order. We would purchase from this vendor again. Thanks for the nice service.
5,Very good book. Very good seller.,"My wife wanted this book after we visited an octagon house in western New York, She is now ""designing"" an octagon house as a mother-in-law house. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Great Value,"I bought this cover because of all the dogs we have that sleep on the bed, and decided that washing the cover would be easier than the new comforter that i just bought. I read the reviews, and i have to say that this is a great bargin, it washes well, and i would recommend it. I also bought the matching sheets but to date have not washed them to use, they did have mixed reviews."
4,"Great cover, weird color","For $20 completely worth it. BUT the color is strange. Not ivory, not pink, not peach. Something in between all of those. My husband hates it. I think it works. Too bad it didn't come with shams. Still, one of the only ones I could find in this size (108 x 98)!"
3,Broad Coverage Of AJAX,I found the spectrum of AJAX coverage very broad. If you are interested in finding out a little about a lot of areas of AJAX this book is alright. I found it's coverage too broad.
4,A Great Read,"I liked the book. It told me a lot about the Knicks and the background politics that I didn't know. But I wanted more history about the Pat Riley days. It's not just about last season. There's a lot of unbelievable stuff leading up to the Knicks getting Sprewell. It could have been better if it had gone back into the team over the last 10 years or so, because there's so much stuff from the Riley era. Overall, the narrative holds up and the authors give some good insight about the reality of NBA life."
3,A wild read,"I'm not a huge Knicks fan, but I really got into the whole story about the team. It also told me lots of inside tidbits about the NBA that I didn't know. I couldn't believe what Michael Jordan said to Jeff Van Gundy in Chapter 3. Like I said, I'm not a huge fan, but it was a wild read."
3,Where were these stories in the paper?,I enjoyed this book - I am a behind-closed-doors junkie and this satisfied that part of me (though 263 pages in large font left me looking for more). The 3-star rating is based on the problem I have with sports writers holding back on material from their primary employers (and dedicated readers) and storing it for their books - This is another self-serving effort (somewhat informative) that I should have read in this amount of detail on my train ride to work in my morning papers.
3,T he Giver,"I thought was an okay book I wouldn't recomend this book to new readers .But for more mature readers that understand the complex words and process in the book .But other than the occational hard words it really shows a great output on how a world would be if you didn't make your own decisions.I mean no one can really make you do something you don't want to do but this book sheds some light on if you had no control over what was happening ,and what your future held for you .So if you want to read about a problem free enviorment that you could't change even if you wanted to, this book is for you .Oh yeah the name of the book is the Giver."
2,Waiting for Tim Hawkinson,"The book was just what I wanted, but as it was damaged in shipment, I returned it for a replacement. I am still waiting for it, and I would like to know if the book is available. Amazon had the lowest price, which is usually the case. However, this is not the first time I have received an order in which items were loose in the box."
1,You've got to be kidding,"I love Roxy Music. I bought this album because a book on Roxy music said it was good. Wrong. I only listened to this once, but it is not my cup of tea. Pretentious, but in reality very light weight intellectually in terms of the music. I'm sure the people that gave it 5 stars would disagree, but don't say you weren't warned.I told my kids I should throw the disc out the truck window. They said I should sell it on eBay. I'm not sure I want the negative feedback that is sure to enure.By the way, ""I'm Not in Love"" is on this album. It's a great song, but I've heard it plenty of times - and it sounds nothing like anything else on this album. The rest of the album sounds like a paradoy of Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (though the reviewer say 10CC came up with that sort of tripe first)."
3,wings meets monty python,"This band's Beatles influence is clear, particularly the Abbey Road era work of Paul McCartney and George Martin. There is also a fair dose of quirky British humour throughout. Where this is a creative, playful album it never quite makes the status of greatness. The musicianship is competent but not outstanding. There is a bit too much taken from the English crooner tradition of the 30's and 40's making for overly dramatic vocal performances that actually detract from the songs rather than enhance their effectiveness. At times, it sounds as if Paul McCartney (Wings era) hooked up with Monty Python to create a playful, comedic, musical that was noble in it's efforts but didn't quite manage to meet with success. Where this is one of the band's better work's, none of their output goes beyond B level progressive pop...Simon"
5,Still Love It,"This was my favorite album when I was in college. I would listen to it every day. It took me a while to find this on CD. It comes with some bonus tracks, too. The songs have great, humorous, lyrics along with good melodies. I have to say that it has held up well. It's hard to believe that this is over 35 years old, now."
3,Another James Murphy Project!!,"Disincarnate was the brainchild of DM guitar god James Murphy.With previous credits such as Death and Obituary under his beltthis album should have been something special, however it lackedsongs and had little in the way of anything that really impressedexcept that is to say the musicianship!The album, which has just been re-released by RoadRunner in Japanstands as an example of exemplary levels of intensity but offerslittle else, cool solos and some spooky sound effects. Incidentally, interviews with Murphy at the time of it's release in '93 read that this is not a Death Metal band! I found it neverless encompasses pretty much everything the genre is about.Peace!"
3,A Different Type,"The Pursuit is quite an exceptional book for the Christian fiction genre. It deals with the issue of a woman, dressing as a man, who is on the run from someone or something. The book takes the normal Wick layout of the two main characters' meeting and falling in love. This book is an extremely easy read, it flows incredibly well so that you do not know you have been reading the book for hours. While it is an easy and quick read, it also does not stray from the normal romance novel plot line. It is a very predictable book. The characters again are normal for a romance novel. One of them always has either a big secret of is incredibly rich, well in this book , you have both. this book lacks no big shock or action in this book, and everything stays with the general plot line. I would recommend this book if and only if you like the romance plot line."
4,Wonderful,"This is an excellent conclusion to the English Garden Series, all ends are tied up nicely and to your satisfaction. With a little more action than the others in the series it keeps your attention throughout the entire book."
3,Not bad but not great either,"I am a huge Lori Wick fan and have read all but a couple of her books, and I have to say I was so disappointed with ""The Pursuit"". It was rather dry and boring through most of the book. As I read I kept thinking that someone else must've wrote it and just put Lori's name on the cover because it was so out of character for her. Her books have always been page turners to me, but I had to muddle through this one. My biggest disappointment was the lack of romance. That's why I read her books is because of romance! I can't help it...I'm a hopeless romantic. But...all was not lost in this book. There were a couple of pretty decent parts. I can't reveal my favorite parts because it will give away too much."
5,The Pursuit Review,I read this book because of the author. Lori Wick is my favorite author. She demonstrates God's forgiving and compassionate love in all her novels. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to discover how you can find God's peace in the midst of trails and chaos. This novel is a picture of exactly that. I especially liked the fact that she always leads the reader to dive deep into God's word and search for his truth.
1,Amateurish and awkward,"This is the first and last Lori Wick book for me. The Characters were shallow, simple puppets moving through a prescribed series of very boring events. I found myself skimming through great portions of the chapters involving characters I can only assume were part of other books in her series, but which I found extraneous and irritating here. There also seemed to be a serious lack of real research for a historical piece, with anachronisms abounding. I found the protagonists simplistic, and their actions overwrought for the situation. The twin's grandmother,(the villain here) was very one-note, with no attempt on the author's part to make her a real person. Instead she appears as almost an afterthought used to explain the ridiculously melodramatic and circuitous actions of the boys mother. Not worth the paper it's printed on, or the time I wasted forcing my way though it."
2,Not Her Best Work,I have read every book that Lori Wick has written and I must say I know that she can do so much better then this. I was more intrested in characters from the previous books then I was in Edward and Niki. I found the story line vary perdictable. the only time I was the least bet surprised was what Edward discoved about Osborne. I'm a huge Lori Wick and fan and will continue to buy and read all her book but I would like to see some books of the same quality as the Kensington Chronicles and the Californians.
1,Lori Wick definetely fails to please with this one,"Although I love Lori Wick's earlier works, her latest english series was disapointment after dissapointment with each new book. The beginning starts off with some hope to redeem the series, but by the middle it becomes all to predictable and juet like her other works. If you want a good Lori Wick read Pretense or Princess; however, she obviously proves with this one that she is past her prime and out of clever ideas."
1,Not durable - broke within a week,Wouldn't waste any money - it broke and I don't even remember dropping or doing anything out of the ordinary w/ this product
2,Wasn't compatible with my computer. No alternatives offered.,Wasn't compatible with my computer. No alternatives offered. Very disappointing since I was looking forward to having my kids learn Spanish from it.
1,Doesn't work,"My kids love jump start and even though some some of the reviews said it doesn't work, I thought I would give it a chance on the old computer in the basement. Nope! I wonder what type of computer is does work on?!"
5,Awesome Introduction to Spanish,"This is an exciting program. It teaches numbers; things in the bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and living room. It teaches body parts and colors. It teaches clothing and even some simple conversational topics like Hi how are you? What is the weather like? Feelings, etc.There is counting and clicking and matching and hide and seek and coloring and dress up and music etc.When the children get 5 stars they get to pick something for their aquarium.It is a great introduction. It will not teach children full Spanish, but it will give a good start.Plus as an added bonus it can be switched to learn English instead and the Instructions come in French, German, English, or Spanish."
2,It did'nt work,I order this for my two year old girl. I didn't receive the same software that shows the picture instead I received one that have a dog and said that its for ages 4-7 when I ordered this one that shows from 3 to 6. I contacted seller they said they changed the age but its the same. Well I don't think so it is to hard for a two year old and instead of a bunny you have a dog. Finally we intalled and it worked one time then it didn't work again. We have contacted support two weeks ago and we haven't received an asnwer yet.
5,My kids love it!,"I have three kids, ages 2,3 and 8 that literally fight over who gets to play this game. My 2 year old boy would sit and play this game for hours if I would let him, it really captures his attention with the bright, colorful graphics, and catchy songs. My daughter who is 8, gets ready for school extra early just so she and her 3 year old sister will have time to play this game. Not only is it fun for them, they have really picked up alot of Spanish words from playing it. I only wish they would make a Spanish 2!"
2,Quickly Bored,"I don't understand the glowing reviews of this program. We picked it up for our 4-year old son because he is interested in learing Spanish. He quickly got bored of it (within a couple weeks) and has learned practically nothing from it. He doesn't like the explore mode. He is used to playing different activities like in his preschool games. That's what he enjoys. In this, you can't productively play the games until after you use the explore mode to learn the words. I wish they had found a way to teach you the words while playing games."
4,A Good Starter,My three year old daughter loves this program and can sing all of the songs in Spanish. My five year old son was bored with it rather quickly until we discovered that you can change the level of difficulty. Now he wants to play it all of the time. This program is a great introduction to the language.
3,JumpStart Spanish,"This is a good tool for learning very basic vocabulary. It is a decent way to expose a young child to a new language. But if you are expecting software equal in quality to the JumpStart K and up programs, you will be disappointed.The conversation ""TV"" is the most disappointing. But my kids LOVE to tour the town and pick up various characters for a ""party."""
1,beware of vendor issue,"The ""rabbit"" version of JS Spanish is only available from one vendor, which apparently is in the habit of shipping the ""dog"" version/""classical"" version, which they sell in another listing for $8 less as a ""value line"", rather than the version ordered."
1,Won't run with Windows 7,"After loading the program kept demanding an older version of Quick Time. (older than the current version by a lot).I even tried to cover up my newest Quick Time with the older version, wouldn't work.Finally gave up and removed the program. Too bad, looks perfect for my 4 yr old grandson who is going to Mexico on vacation.I hope they update the software, it says Windows 95 on the cover. So probably won't run with XP or Vista either."
5,Very Effective Program,"We bought this as an introduction to spanish for our 3yr. old son. I loved the price and was relieved to find such a good program cheaper than the programs advertised on T.V. It teaches vocabulary, games, and cultural information as well. The progress report helps me to know what area he needs help with. I also love how you can earn fish for the fish tank by completing activities. The only down side it that is it too easy for my son to change the levels therefore he'll play the game before learning the vocabulary. I love this product and think it is wonderful!!A must have for all preschool parents and homeschoolers."
1,"Bit by the ""Classic"" version switch","Chalk me up as another unsatisfied customer that received the wrong version of the software. I guess I should pay more attention to all of the reviews, and not just read the first few. Lesson learned!"
4,Great for preschool age children,"Preschool age children love this program. I know because I use it with several of them. It has the color and variety that attracts them, and it can be configured for basic level learning or immersion style."
1,jump start spanish,product did not work with my computer.tried several other programs and none were work either. I am very disappointed. I have bought many items from Amazon and this the first time I have had trouble. People who sell things have an obligation to tell buyers of any restrictions on the product.
2,For old computers only,"This just doesn't work on new computers. It's only compatible with Windows ME, 2000, and XP. Wish they had a newer version because I've heard that it is a cute program."
5,Only You,"Only You by Rosemary Wells is a wonderful book that shows how important children are to their parents. In the story, the mother spends a lot of quality time by cooking, painting, dancing, and playing with her child. Spending time with a child is the best present a parent can give a child. The mother bear accepts her child and lets him explore the world around him. One beautiful line in the story is ""Only you... can turn a gray sky blue. Without you near."" Thus, no matter what the child does they should always feel safe. The mother bear supports the young bear's learning in every possible way by letting him experience the world. Knowing that children learn from first hand experience. The mother bear models reading behavior early in the book. Later the young bear sits in the same chair and tries to read a book. If a child see a parent enjoy activity it gives the activity more value. Thus, the ultimate message is parents are a child's first teacher and most important role model."
2,Just ok to me,"My son likes this book just because it has a bear on it, but I find the book slightly annoying to read. The lines flow very poorly. It is my least favorite of the many children's books we own."
4,Could be better,"Makes charging multiple controllers for the PS3 much easeier than the single, one-at-a-time charging from the cable provdided with the PS3. A little hard to plug controllers in since you cannot see where to insert the controller but that is the only flaw. For what is available on the market right now for charging multiple controllers this is about as good as it gets."
3,Works Well But Finicky,"This charger does what it's supposed to do, charging both of my controllers quite quickly, however it really is a bit of a hassle to seat the controllers ever so exactly into the receiving USB port. I find it's easier if I hold the controller by its ends, rather than front and back. It does seem to me they could have engineered this better to make the seating more solid."
4,Great!,"This charger works great and does what it is supposed to. Only neg. comment would be the same as others have said. It can be hard to line up the hole in the controller with the slot on the charger, but just takes a little time and patience."
4,Nice product for controllers,I was finally glad to see this product released. I was tired of putting my controllers tethered off my PS3 and leaving wires all over the place. This is kept separate from my PS3 and allows me to have my controllers charged at all times and neatly put away out of site. I will say be patient when you first get the product. It can be a bit tricky to seat the controller the first couple of times. I am glad if finally came out.
4,Nyko Charge Base,"I've had this charger 3 weeks now and it works great and constantly keeps my PS3 controllers charged. the only thing I don't like about is that placing the controllers in takes a little time, about 15-30 seconds, compared to the just a second it takes for other controller chargers for my Xbox360 and Wii. also the stickers that go on the mini USB port are useless. i tried putting them there and a few days later they fell off."
4,great product,"The product makes charging controllers a lot easier. It is a great thing to have if you have multiple people over to play a game. putting the controllers in takes some getting used to, but is fast and easy once you get used to it."
2,Does what it is designed to do.,"Nice addition to the PS3 to have your controlers charged. It can be a bit difficult getting them into the base, but not too bad.Two of the ports were ruined very easily due to the difficulty in putting the controllers into the slots. I think some others have now made it easier to line up the controler to go into the slot so this does not happen."
2,Good thought bad execution,I bought this for the fact that it could charge 4 controllers at once from a wall outlet instead of having the cables pluged into my PS3. Now yes it is a bit tricky to get the controller in and I knew that ahead of time so I was just very gentle when I put the controllers away but after a month of use the charger will only charge controllers in the #2 and #4 slots. If I plug a dead controller into slot #1 or #3 it doesn't do anyting. I probably wouldn't recomend this for everyone with it being a little dificult to plug in the PS3 controller but more for the reason that 2 of the charge ports quit working after 1 month.
3,Nice but very hard to put controls in,Everytime I insert it unless I like lucky I feel like I will break the control.
4,"Just a bit quirky, thats all........","I bought this charger just after I purchased my PS3 and overall have been pretty happy with it.I read the reviews and most people liked it. Those that didn't were especially harsh on the difficulties they had putting the Sixaxis controllers in the base. I'll admit, the first time I put a controller in the base, it took me a little to figure out, but once I did, it's really not a problem at all.You can set this charger just about anywhere, as it does not need to be right near the PS3. This is a good thing if you have young children like I do.Overall, a solid, if a little quirky charger."
4,"Well, it charges controllers...","It's hard to get the controllers in. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not. When you take out a fully charged controller and you put it back in, it shows red like it's still charging. But it gets the job done. Nice feature wall outlet power source rather than ps3 usb port."
2,"Great introduction, but ...","This book featured a wonderful, informative, and highly useful biography of Bernard of Clairvaux, one of the best I've come across. The biography listed many, if not all, of Bernard's most important writings. The rest of the book, however, did not contain any of them. Still, the biography alone was worth the effort of reading the book."
5,Bernard Clairvaux: Selected Works,An excellent book for anyone seeking to use the Early Church Fathers as mentors in learnig to know God better. The book includes writings of St. Bernard that focus on a deeper intimate relationship with God. G.R. Evans provides a brief introduction of the writings as well as a short biography on St. Bernard. Well edited and easy to understand.
3,Um...,"...It sure would be nice to know *which* of his albums entitled ""Luiz Gonzaga, Jr"" this is... The one from 1973, '74, or the new reissue of the album from '71 that preceded those two? Track listings sure would help."
1,Booklet is incomplete,"I ordered the ""Violin and the art of its construction..."", written by mygrand-grand-father and I got it. But the ""four lithographed plates"" - mentioned on page one of this paperback - was not enclosed.Therefor my question: could You send me the ""four lithographed plates"" or - in case You can not - try to add it to Your paperback in future for the next custemers, the original booklet can be found in the Toront University. Without the plates it is not so easy to understand the Text.Hope You understand my English.Sincerely YoursHans WunderThe violin and the art of its construction: a treatise on the Stradivarius violin"
3,A Lot To Recommend It... And Not To,"Deep Forest has two songs on the album; one of them, ""While The Earth Sleeps,"" features Peter Gabriel.A wierd pairing of artists is Ray Manzarek's appearance as keyboardist with Prong on the Doors' classic ""Strange Days."" A die-hard Doors fan might fling the disc across the room a bit, before actually feeling the new version grow on them.Leonard Cohen's ""Dance me To The End Of Love,"" is covered with competance by Hate Gibson. Me Phi Me's ""Jericho One"" has to be heard, such a highlight it is.But, does anyone who even remotely like PJ Harvey want to sit through Juliette Lewis' rendering of Harvey's lyrics on ""Hardly Wait,"" or would they rather watch paint dry?"
4,how to get a smile on your face,"listening, to Graeme Revell's music you will find a sadeness and lonely smile on your crying face. But who cares? this CD makes me cry and smile at the same time."
3,"Unessential Clapton, but fun nonetheless!","Six tracks culled from Eric Clapton's various concerts during the mid-70's. This was not a peak period for the guitarist, and this CD reflects it. However, it's still an entertaining listen for fans. Highlights: ""Ramblin' On My Mind"" (the only track not available on the 4 CD Crossroads 2 box set). END"
4,Cool blues,"Missed this CD in my E.C. collection.Astonished to hear wellknown numbers in a different way.This live performence is pure blues, cool performed.Refreshing duet with Yvonne Elliman."
5,Clapton at his best !,"There is nothing I have heared before this LP/Cd that is close. Blind Faith, Cream . This is it... best Clapton live to date bar none. Can't find my may home, who thought Eric could sing it better then Steve Winwood. This is a must have."
3,"""F sharp""","Strange album, and, if I recall correctly, it came out without a lot of fanfare. Everybody cites ""Driftin"" as a cornerstone guitar moment in Clapton's ""God"" career, but can you not hear him barking out the chords during the big solo? I mean, couldn't he have rehearsed the band a little better? I've always liked this album, even though it's not recorded particularly well and it has a little bit of ""what's the point?"" about it. There are lovely moments like ""Presence of the Lord,"" the big ""Driftin Blues"" solo, a roadhouse style ""Further On Up the Road."" Clapton has made a huge pile of stinkers in his second half (and third half) career, but this isn't one of them. It's not ""461,"" but it's got buzz. You could do worse."
4,Clapton Shines,"A Great, Great, Great example of what Clapton was like before he settled into the business of making music.... He has found himself again, but there were many years when Eric could have easily replaced Don Williams and nobody would have noticed. Sorry Eric, I'm just busting your chops a little. But this work was stellar, it shined, it rocked, it did everything a Great Rock or Blues album was supposed to do AND it showcased the Eric Clapton as no other Clapton release had.... don't get me wrong, he is a great bluesman, but this one tied it all up.... guitar wizardry, vocals... back up... just a solid release for the world to thoroughly enjoy."
4,Good live cuts,"Eric Clapton / E. C. was here: A nice album, an enjoyable listen, but feels like a tease for something that should have been longer and greater. Four Stars"
1,poorly made bit,"There is one critical issue with this bit: bearing diameter is slightly smaller than cutter diameter. So, if you rout a shallow mortise, bit will cut into your template, or, worse, a jig. I ruined my mortising jig (worth many times more than this bit), before I noticed the problem."
1,Remastered Version Review,"I have the remastered and my old original Jet Records of Diary. I just popped in the remastered after not listening to either for to long. I can't stand it! My Jet is all scratched up but still plays. Oh, love this CD! Diary is what it is: the time the people the atmosphere the studio, the budget. This are all parts that make this album great. Don't F#$& with it, You'll just F^#@ it up! Also this was an exceptionally F^$%ed up remaster job. FU"
1,"They can erase Daisley's bass, but not his lyrics","Sadly, it is not common knowledge that Bob Daisley was the primary lyricist on Ozzy's first five albums--not too mention his musical input--because to reveal that would be destroying the manufactured image of Ozzy as the songwriter he never has been. Pure greed and devious machinations in the Osbourne camp perpetrated this atrocious maneuver, however to remove Bob Daisley's hand entirely from the two albums would have created the need to write entirely new songs, so he gets the last laugh in at least some way. Bordin and Trujillo should have been blacklisted from the industry for participating in such a crime."
5,Essential release from Ozzy,"This album along with Blizzard of Ozz is a must have for all Ozzy/Black Sabbath fans. Although Diary of a Madman doesn't get as many rave reviews as Blizzard of Ozz, it may be the stronger album. Randy Rhoads' guitar playing was clearly growing more toward classical playing, particularly on the title track. Very strong selection of songs such as ""Over the Mountain"", ""Little Dolls"" and ""Flying High Again."" The very underrated ""You Can't Kill Rock and Roll"" may be the best of his slower tracks. The lesser known tracks such as ""Believer"" and ""S.A.T.O."" are strong as well. There's no filler here unlike many of the albums he made after this. It's a shame Randy passed on, as it would have been interesting to see where they could have gone after this."
3,"It doesn't compare to ""Blizzard of Ozz""...","THis sequence in OZzy's career is worthwhile only because of RAndy Rhoads. In general, is a good album."
3,This is a review?,"People say this is not an album at all, it is a piece of paper that has fleas. Does Ozzy have fleas? Somtimes I wonder with all those drugs he does. He is now a tv star. Why is he a tv star...? Cause he is on tv. Ok... I just put this to see if they let anyone give reviews"
4,Still rocks...,"Even though it's not the ""original masterpiece"" it's still a masterpiece. Trujillo and Bordin are 2 very talented musicians and they prove this (not only being on tour with Ozzy) on this album. They do not harm the album in anyway. Only buy it if you're a collector or a diehard Ozzy fan."
1,"How pathetic, Ozzy","I think Tony Iommi should grab some no-name lounge singer and re-issue PARANOID!That's exactly what OZZY deserves for what he's done to this CD!!Ozzy, seriously man, don't you have enough money to afford paying royalties to the guys who helped you out of the gutter and to create the great ORIGINAL recording?Pathetic"
1,Burn the album to CDR - dont buy this junk,"Ozzy... what the hell was he thinking??? This is one of the two greatest rock albums ever brought to being by the great OZ (the second being Blizzard). I bought this one on vinyl the day it was released & fell in love with the way it was recorded and mixed. UNFORTUNATELY, this is not the same recording & should be avoided at all costs. PLEASE believe all of the negative reviews!! The music is different, the bass lines are terrible, and the drumming is so off time, its amazing they kept the tracks. I'm not an engineer, just an average music fan who really likes Ozzy. Do yourself a favor and miss this one."
3,Classic album tampering...thanks Sharon,"This is a classic album that should have been left alone. Ozzy has admitted numerous times that he knows nothing of the music business, so who do we blame for this? His manager Sharon. She replaced Bob Daisley's bass playing with Robert Trujillo's and Lee Kerslakes' drumming with Mike Bordin. I'm sorry but I see no point in this and it's a rip-off to the fans. Sharon probably didn't want to pay these two any royalties or something. But what if she had replaced Randy Rhodes with Zakk Wylde? THAT would have caused a riot at any OzzFest. Sharon knew if she did that she'd have hell to pay, not only from Randy's mom, but every longtime Ozzy fan.I'll admit the album itself sounds great, but that's no excuse. I can hear differences in the bass and drums when I compare it to my old vinyl copy, but for the most part the playing is identical. Shame on you Sharon, not only for tampering with classic albums, but for now making his Ozzness a walking, talking joke on MTV."
1,terrible re-recording,"The rythm section that replaces the original is good, in time, but not an inch more than that. Just average good musicians.The original band, with kerslake and Daisley played beautifully, originally. Buy the previous remaster, not this fraud.The same happened with 'Blizard'. Ozzy is extremely greedy and cheap for doin this mess."
1,Greed.,"I can think of very few acts more despicable than this in the annals of rock music. I hate Ozzy and his wife. This outrage needs to be more widely known. Sickening. Needless to say, don't buy this reissue with rerecorded drums and bass. The Osbournes' greed knows no limits."
3,What The?!,"Once again, like ""blizzard , a classic metal album has been tampered with. This just goes to show how greedy ozzy has become. Lets face it, the reality show has ruined everything"
5,Ozzy's greatest solo album,"Although it was recorded with the same band as Blizzard of Oz, it sounds like 2 different rhythm sections if you compare the two LPs. Of course Randy was still brillant, but it just goes to show what a good producer can do. Song for song this album is so much stronger than Blizzard, it's amazing. The songwriting, and song structures, everything!!! Not a bad song on the album but the standouts would have to be You Can't Kill Rock and Roll and SATO. Tonight was the ballad of the album and probably the weakest track, but compared to Goodbye To Romance, the ballad off of Blizzard, it smokes. Especially Randy's solos. This review is for the original LP, not this rerecorded stuff I'm hearing about. All I can say to a rerecording of this LP is ""why?"". It's as near perfection as Ozzy has ever gotten!!! It's the only (solo)album of his I can listen to all the way through without any disappointments!"
1,Sadly... a let down,"Where is the long fade out on ""Tonight""?... no rarities?... no pics of Daisley and Kerslake? The four of them were the real Blizzard of Ozz magic. This lame release is just another of Sharon's despicable acts of greed.Fortunately, Randy Rhoads' legacy of immense talent and inspiration continues to growth in spite of the money whore Osbourne clan."
1,Utter DESECRATION! OUTRAGEOUS! How could they?!,"This remaster is NOT the original music! It has a different rhythm section. And it's not even stated on the CD package/cover when purchasing it! Whomever is responsible for altering the original recording (Sharon?) should be ashamed of themselves! This is a prime example of greed running roughshod over original art. How do you think Picasso or Monet (or their admirers) would feel if their art was altered, then re-sold as the originals? This is just as bad as picking up a compilation CD of yesterday's 70's or 80's hits, only to find out the songs are not played by the original artists, but by some cheesy wedding band or subpar studio musicians. I am beyond dissapointed in this latest ugliness and greed, as evidenced by these non original releases masquerading as the original tracks."
1,Diary of a massacre,"The ""remastering"" - read butchering imposed to this metal classic by the Osbournes and/or their record company is unbelievable. Kudos for making it like s*** too. Get the original album. This is not Ozzy and will definitely remain a stain on his legacy."
5,Black Magic Rhythm Section,"Looking for Metal? First of all, forget the '02 remix with the phony-baloney bass & drums -- there were no ""extra tracks"" in 1981, anyway. In addition to the legendary Osbourne/Rhoads assault, some sort of witchcraft flows between Daisley/Kerslake on 'Diary'. The hair on the back of your neck will stand up at least 10 times during the course of this album, guaranteed..."
3,remaster is less than original for sure but it has a bonus track,Both remasters of the first two ozzy discs are less than the originals.This one is just like everyone else said a poorer version of the first version in everyway except one: it has a bonus track on it. It's good to put out bonus tracks and this should be the case on every cd release whenever possible. I bought both versions of this and although the new drummer and bassist do a great job of playing on this cd it wasn't needed at all. And the remix has lost much of the power of one of the best metal cd's of all time. This type of metal is in my opinion so much better than most of what's around today that even a poorer version of it rocks clearer and smoother than most of the newer bands out there.
3,Why???...wow,I have compared the 2002 remastered versions with the orignals... the difference might be missed by some but... i assure you the 1995 remaster is better if you take the time to listen closely....the 1995 is sooo much better(this is because the 2002 is remixed and party remade)This is falsely labeled remaster it is a remake.Do yourself a favor and DONT buy the 2002 remade version. Plain and simple if u have ears and are payin attention it just dont sound as good. Besides i think any real fan would want the orignal versions no matter what.PS theres a new legacy remaster version of this cd thats not remade just remastered which compares to the 95 remaster.
1,bass and drum BOMB!!!!,"My God, i was just sampling this and the reissue of Blizzard. I became so angry, i had to throw my 2 cents in on both. Sharon O is the Donald Trump of Rock N Roll. This musical piece of remeastered afterbirth is a very good reflection of what Ozzy has allowed himself to become. I am completely satisfied in owning the original cd's of these albums. Along with Bark at The Moon, Ultimate SIn, and Tribute albums......there is no need to bother purchasing anything else Ozzy puts out."
1,Ozzy's Worst Ever,"Ozzy had the audacity to remove Bob Daisley & Lee Keerslake from this remaster. How can you remove the man who wrote all of the lyrics and more than 1/3 of the music? There would have been no ""Flying High Again"" or ""Over The Mountain"" for Ozzy to ride to glory without Bob's music & lyrics...in fact Bob has written the Lion's share of Ozzy's solo hit songs. Can you imagine if every band that broke up did this? Will he replace Geezer & Bill Ward on the Black Sabbath albums next? Don't support this childish, vindictive, behavoir. He's ruined the 2 greatest Metal albums of all time while trying to re-write the history to bring himself more glory...and most importantly to him & Sharon....more cash!"
1,"Buy the old version, not this one","The original version is a classic, a must have. Randy was unreal and Ozzy voice is piercing. Bob and Lee are instrumental with their tracks, no pun intended. However, Bob and Lee are removed from the newer CD versions and and the new drum and bass tracks just don't sound right. How can it, when you add new drums and bass with current technology over 1981 recording techniques (and it also sounds like it was done last minute)? Plus the fact Bob and Lee were there with Randy putting it all together; the vibe was there big time. I hope that everyone will work out their differences and we'll see a Super DVD or DVD-Audio, or some super high resolution media released of the original version of this. For now, find yourself the Diary of a Madman remaster version from 1995."
2,Whats up with this?,You actually still can buy the real version of this album on this site if you look hard enough.This version however is strictly for the die hard Ozzy fan who wants 2 versions.Everyone else should buy the 1995 remaster which features the original musicians.
5,a great album from some great musicians,"Ozzy's second album, while not as good as the first, is still very, very good. Anyone even slightly interested in heavy metal would love this with its feast of great music. Believer and Diary are particularly fin, but that takes nothing from the other tracks, which are classic Ozzy from beginning to end. Just buy it. You'll like it alot."
3,One Of The Most Overrated Albums Of The Eighties,"I don't get why everyone loves this album so much. I love Ozzy, but this album is not one of his best. First of all, as good as Ozzy's solo work is, it never could match the classic Sabbath material. Also, if you want to here Randy Rhoads in top form, you should listen to ""Tribute"". His work on this is good, but ""Tribute"" is a much better display of his abilities. Hearing him blast through Sabbath classics like ""Paranoid"" is simply unbelievable. If you want to here Ozzy at his best, listen to classic Sabbath or ""Blizzard Of Ozz"". The only real stand out on this cd is ""Over The Mountain"", and even that can't compare to a lot of Ozzy's other work. This album is good, but it's not great."
3,Still good the remasterd that is..,"Yeah The remasterd remixed wasn't a very smart move of ozzy but he tried something new... and if u don't listen so deep into the song You hear him repeating the chorous in the back round but to occaisonal fan this is a good cd to buy. STand out tracks ""Flying High Again"" ""Over the Mountain"" ""SATO"" and ""Diary of a MADMAN"" Enjoy fellow METAL HEADS!"
4,Worth owning,"this cd and ""blizzard of ozz"" I kind of think as one CD since Ozzy recorded both at the same time. I keep reading how this cd is ""inferior"" to the blizzard cd but I disagree. I like both of them equally...""Little Dolls"" is kinda lame but other than that, it's great. The slow break in the title song is very cool as well as the ending with the choir...it just sounds so EVIL(ha ha). I bought this remastered CD last week after not owning or hearing it since I bought the vinyl album in 1982 when I was 12yo. I really miss Ozzy's 80's music... I'm gonna buy all of them. Long live Ozzy... and watch his show on MTV!! And as far as the controversy about re-recording the bass and drums with his current musicians...I can't tell the difference for one second ...!!!! It's Ozzy's music, he must have had a good reason ..."
1,"Stay Away from This Doctored, Freakish ""Remaster""","As was done with Ozzy's brilliant Blizzard of Oz, this ""remaster"" was altered in a significant way: the label removed the original bass and drums and substituted newly-recorded tracks in their place. There is no way to know this looking at the outside of the cd, one has to read the buried, ""new"" Blizzard lineup in the liner notes, also know that Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslak were original members of Blizzard, and then figure it out by seeing two other guys besides them playing bass and drums. Pretty sneaky! It would be like buying the White Album and learning that Paul and Ringo's parts were replaced in 2002 by the two guys who play them on Beatlemania. A total ripoff."
2,A TRAGEDY....,"This is the first time EVER (at least that I've heard of) that a classic rock album is not only remastered or remixe, but has important parts (ALL THE BASS AND DRUMS) re-recorded by other musicians!! Sacrilegy!Maybe because Ozzy is no longer capable to thinking properly about business matters, his manager could do anything she wanted, including casting a shadow above Randy RHoad's memory...His guitar work does not sound shinning, fresh and flashy in this new reissue... a SHAmE, MY FRIENDS, a total shame.Such a great album destroyed. Trujillo and Bordin are not to blame, they're just employees of Ozzy."
1,Terrible,The only thing Ozzy was good for was his tenure with Sabbath and after DIO joined Ozzy became irrelevent. Ozzy's solo albums continue to suck and this is just another pop album to add to the pile.
4,dioary of a madman.written by a madman,"wen i first bort vis album, i didnt really like it.it woz v first album i had of his, although i watched the osbournes and i had heard some black sabbath stuff like paranoid.as i say i didnt really like it vat much, but after a while i really started t like it.Some of my favourite tracks ar:over the mountain, tonight and the title track.i also fink that rhandy rhoads and zakk whylde are equally as good at guitar.fankx for reading me review by the way!"
3,Live set has a different feel from Tribute cd. Good performance,"This Concert offers nothing really new to the average listener, but it is a must to randy fans. You never get tired of listening to such a guitar god.The live set has a different feel than the live Tribute Cd, a different vibe.As in the tribute cd, bass and drums sound lousy. The good: In some songs Randy plays slightly differenrt riffs and better executed solos, like in Paranoid.Randy's sound and articulation is better recorded on this set than on Tribute. The guitar is well in front so you can listen to randy quite clearly.Believer is indeed a bit slower and heavier sounding than the other versions.Five stars for randys playing, two stars for the bootleg sound."
1,THE ULTIMATE S...SS...SCANDAL,Whoop-la... I think Amazon.com mistitled this remaster. NOW THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SCANDAL (or shame).
1,Senseless Remix,"This otherwise stellar album has been RUINED by a sensless remix. This is akin to fresh, moist, large, heaping piles of human excrement, so be sure to buy the 1995 remaster instead. To sum it up: Bad move, Ozzy. Very bad move... At least you didn't replace Randy Rhoads' guitar parts. We'd have to kill you for that, you greedy, incoherent, mumbling junkie."
5,100% AWESOME!!!!!,"I will keep this short & sweet. This remaster sounds AWESOME!! Lee Kerslake & Bob Daisley are back on & rightfully so. Bonus ""live"" disc is a gem. Yes, it is pretty much the same set list as ""Tribute"", but this concert sounds a tad more raw & in your face. I really like it. Five stars all the way. You will not be disappointed."
3,Good,"This album is the last studio album with Ozzy featuring the great Randall ""randy"" Rhoads. After that, even gaining more success than ever, nothing was the same. THis CD is no doubt worse than ""BLIZZARD OF OZZ"", but is still a great rock product."
1,HORRIBLE,This DL sucks. It's broken and glitchy. I would have done better recording the drunks at a karaoke bar. NO STARS FOR YOU!:P
3,"How can you follow up ""Blizzard of ozz""?","""Diary of a madman"" is not by any means comparable to ""Blizzard of ozz"". While the debut album had such a strong set of songs it can't be regarded as nothing else than one of the finest metal albums ever made, ""Diary of a madman"" is a rather pale follow up. This is similar to the situation with Black Sabbath's ""Heaven and hell"" and ""Mob rules"" - it's hard if not impossible to follow up a masterpiece! But I believe this album includes two of Ozzy's greatest songs ever - ""Over the mountain"" and ""Flying high again"". They are both excellent!"
2,Disappointing Remix,"Do not buy this CD. I had the original LP and it kicked. Since the guitar work had been redone by studio musicians, it stinks. In the song Diary of a Madman, the guitar stomps on Ozzy's vocals. I had to end up buying another copy of the original four days after I bought this one. The cost of returning this one, made it prohibitive, and therefore I was stuck with this butchered version."
2,thanks for ruining a masterpiece Ozzy,Before I bought the original I had this disgrace. This just doesn't sound anything like the original. In the original there was better bass. Bob Daisley sounds way better than Robert Trujillo. I also think Ozzy might have tweaked Randy's guitar tone (HOW COULD YOU) The drummer isn't that good on the remaster. I have originals of this and Blizzard of Ozz. You can buy the originals here on amazon. They are worth hunting down. If you see one with a date before 2002 buy it. If Ozzy has any respect for the fans he will put out the originals again. He just destroyed a classic album.
1,"Buy the 8 track original, not this horrible remaster.","Musically, this is a great album. The redone bass and drums, however, are horrible and detract from the ""remaster"" in every way. Buy a used copy of the totally superior early remaster with the tiny little album cover. Any early copy, cassette or LP or whatever, beats this catastrophe of a ""remaster."""
1,asdf,"Dont get me wrong, Diary of a Madman is probably one of the bands best albums, but this re-release is to be thrown away. They completely re-recorded the bass and drum tracks with the current Ozzy members, so that they wouldnt have to pay the original band members royalties, even though they were some of the ones that wrote and arranged songs with Randy, Ozzy usually has nothing to do with the music, and quite often doesnt even write lyrics.I will never purchase another Ozzy album again, do yourself a favor and try to find the original recording of this album on ebay or something. Do not give a single penny to these greedy people."
1,Why mess with it?,"I don't own this and won't own it. By an earlier version and hear Randy the way Randy wanted you to hear him, not the way pop superstars Ozzy and Sharon think you should hear him. Ozzy is such an idiot. How someone that can put together such a great group of musicians, year after year, can be so stupid is beyond me. Not to mention, this album is huge. You don't just go and replace people and mix down the real star of the band. Anyway, if you can find an earlier version of the CD, buy it. It's a great album when it hasn't been tampered with, other than raising the volume a bit. It's a shame people continue to support Ozzy, when all he has really done for the past 3 decades is ride the coat-tails of the person standing to his left."
1,This just makes me angry.,Im extremely ticked off at Ozzy and Sharon.If they gave half a damn about their fans they would rerelease these albums in their original glory with the original musicians.This is the worst thing ever to happen to music.Ever.This is worse than Milli Vanilli.Doesnt Ozzy Osbourne have a conscience anymore?Is he on drugs again?That would explain this cruel treatment.I used to have this on vinyl and it was great but it got scratched.I demand that Ozzy will come to his senses and rerelease this with the original musicians.This is awful.
1,Half an album with no credit where it was due,"IN response to the previous reviewer regarding Bob Daisley's and Lee Kerslake's contributions. Their parts were removed and dubbed by other players owing to Ozzie's non payment of royalties. There may be an ongoing legal situation here. I also fully expect this review to be removed if Ozzie's people read it. However, I hope that many people read it before he does have it removed so that they are made aware of what a misery-guts Ozzie really is. Do the work, get paid what you are due. Employ the staff, PAY THEM!!! Incidentally, Bob's parts were dubbed by Rob Trujillo ... I cannot and will not ever understand what could possibly possess people to comply with a request to play overdubbed bass and drums on a piece of work which was made many years ago and was outstanding in the first place. Shame.from Pete in Sydney, Australia."
1,"1 star for ""this"" not original","Don't mess with a classic.....this & Blizzard of Ozz are the best 2 albums EVER made!! As I stated in my review of Blizzard, I am glad to own the original CDs I bought in the 90's"
4,"4,5 stars Amazing album",This is one of his best albums ever. It continues his very good solo career after Blizzard of ozz and it is an album i recommend anyone to get.
1,_BIG_ Letdown,"I loved Ozzy Osbourne's Blizzard of Ozz a whole lot. What a great album. This one is a big dissapointment though. There are two pretty good songs, and I do mean pretty good: Over the Mountain, and Flying High Again. Over The Mountain regurgitates a section of I Don't Know, and it is so obvious, that I wonder why there haven't been complaints. Besides those two, the rest are a pain to listen too. Cheesy ballads like You Can't Kill Rock and Roll, and Tonight, are just pathetic and you hit the skip button pretty fast. Britney Spears' Baby One More Time CD is much better than this one, and I am not even close to exaggerating. Skip it. Get No More Tears, maybe Tribute, and definitely Blizzard of Ozz. And before I get bashed for this one, listen to both CD's before you say that Diary is better than Baby One more Time."
4,"Good book, required for a course","Seems to be pretty helpful. Haven't read much past the first few chapters, which deal mostly with the Requirements Engineering processes. Good for anyone who needs to learn more about Software Engineering methods or if you are studying to take the CSDA certification exam."
1,Not worth the time investment or price,"I am a software engineering professional, Rational methodology certified, worked with unified process for over 12 years, and a veteran project manager. This book was literally a waste of my time and effort to read, as it glosses over so many significant points to developing requirements. Additionally, it does not cover the end-to-end perspective of requirements (how they ""mature"" during the lifecycle of a project). I would recommend looking at the books from the ""3 Amigos"" from the original Rational Software Corporation. The methodology has not changed significantly since the introduction of these books, and they are a better learning experience."
3,Why would you read this book?,"This is by no means a bad book, but unless you are trying to read everything Steinbeck wrote, why would you read it? I am by no means a Steinbeck scholar and I can think of 6 books he wrote that are much better than this one. You have to be willing to stick with this one, which gets slow and goes off on tangents at some points, in order to get to the ending. The moral of the story, so to speak, is pretty apparant all along and the end is really not that much of a surprise. All in all, I would recommend this only to people who are either fanatics of Steinbeck or who are particularly interested in the history of Monterrey, CA. area."
4,A Great Book,"My favorite Steinbeck book, perhaps even my favorite book. Its characters are interesting and riveting. I first read the book when i was backpacking the UK and i found myself pulling it out whenever i had the chance to read a few pages. The paperback conveniently fit in my back pocket so i read everywhere from train stations to pubs. The story can be read as a light novella which can be enjoyed at face value or as the story of a modern King Arthur and his court with a little Robin Hood thrown in for good measure. The book is a great telling of the poor Danny and the boys as they banned together to get through life. This book is far superior to Steinbecks later and preachier novels such as The Grapes of Wrath."
3,Steinbeck at his least believable,"An amusing read, but the truth is stretched beyond belief.I much preferred Cannery Row.Read that instead if possible."
4,More depressing than the movie.,"This novel made Steinbeck's reputation, but it is a bit dated and a bit depressing, with the lowest of humanity as its subject."
3,Entertaining... at first,"I read about half of this book and just could not keep enough interest to finish it. While the writing is wonderful, there is just not much development of the story. Halfway through the book we have the same characters in the same place doing the same things. I suppose that's a theme of the story itself, but it was just a little too hopeless for my taste. If you want vintage Steinbeck, read 'The Grapes of Wrath.'"
2,"If this is about friendships, I don't want any!","Steinbeck portrays a pathetic group of acquaintances. An addiction to booze is the motive -with few exceptions- for every kind action. Tortilla Flat is good for a taste of reality, but not one that fills you with conviction to be a better friend."
5,One Great & Overlooked Book,"This is an example of an overlooked classic and brilliant morality tale. This story is very funny and very perceptive. This is an automatic read. If you see this, just make yourself read it. You will never forget the truths of the human condition in America that Steinbeck relays to us. I'm looking forward to the day that America starts paying attention to the least of us and values diversity. You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."
4,Early California Counter-culture,"John Steinbeck was an American classic. His two seminal books, East of Eden and Grapes of Wrath are, in my opinion, both on the top 10 list of American fiction. But readers would be making a big mistake to stop reading Steinbeck with those two novels. The author with this, his breakout book, shows the tremendous breadth of his abilities. This book could be read as pure escapism with a loveable group of unreliable scoundrels. It could also be seen as an early example of beat writers, albeit with a slower pace. But it belongs on all American fiction lovers shelves. It is one of those reads that will stay in most readers hearts and souls."
4,Vintage early Steinbeck,"John Steinbeck has set many of his stories in the Monterrey, CA area where he himself is from. Tortilla Flat, though not flat at all, is part of that town and inhabited by Paesanos. People who are a mix of everything. They are poor, have to scrape their money together except for main character Danny, who inherits two houses. This wealth does not do him a lot of good however. He attracks people who go and live in his house. They really want to help him but they can't always. For them he is almost like a saint. But he cracks and when he is gone the one thing that holds them together is gone and they go their way.It's short (about 150 pages), easy to read and sometimes funny. As always with Steinbeck he knows how to create atmosphere and you identify with the people, even though they are no angels at all."
5,Laughing on the Floor,"I literally laughed while reading this excellent book. This is a good example of why JS won the Nobel Peace Prize for literature. His writing is so beautiful and full of irony. Hilarious to see these paisanos and how they do anything for wine. After I finished it, I bought a bottle of wine and drank it. Also gave a copy of this book to my step-mom. I recommend this to anyone, even children."
3,"Male movie, not enjoyed by women as much.",I would like to know the names of the five dogs in the movie. Can anyone help?
3,Didn't identify with these guys,"I've read a lot of Steinbeck this year, and though his command for the language is wonderful even if he were writing a clothing catalogue, I didn't understand why these people were so ""cool."" It was like Cannery Row but with an ending that suited them."
5,Funny-sad,"If I weren't so moved by this book, I'd probably say, ""Typical Steinbeck"". It is so, but what strikes you isn't the fact that it is a typical Steinbeck novel, but that creates a lump in your throat, especially towards the end, when Danny dies in his attempt to conquer the monotony of his own existence."
4,A Foreshadow of Greatness,"When I first read Tortilla Flat, I really enjoyed it. It is a slice of life for a group of unemployed and generally carefree men. Essentially it is about relationships for this rag-tag posse whose main concern is how they are going to con enough money out of their friends and neighbors to afford their next gallon of wine.Danny owns a house in the area known as Tortilla flat and becomes a local legend with his drunken antics. Encased in a series of misadventerous tales, it is all about loyal relationships and easygoing hedonism. When I finished reading for the first time, I wanted nothing else to recline in the sun with a group of friends and sip wine from jam jars.What it boils down to is this: Tortilla Flat is a great read, but if you want to experience Steinbeck exploring similar themes, consider picking up Cannery Row (written ten years after Tortilla Flat).And yes, I will even deign to give this book a completely subjective letter grade: B"
3,not steinbeck's best,"Interesting basis, but the writing is not nearly as good as his later writing. There's not much along the lines of character development. It's a story about freedom, friendship and the burden of property. If you want to read Steinbeck I would recommend ""East of Eden."""
2,Mediocre,"This book's main goal is to show that even petty thieves who live for the pleasures of wine are human and beautiful in their humanity. Along with a plethora of awful habits, these peasants have lovable and desirable qualities that make the reader want to love and hate them at the same time. Overall, this book does not demonstrate what Steinbeck is capable of, yet is it humorous and attractive nevertheless."
5,"A bit depressing, but it is Steinbeck after all.","In typical Stienbeck style, the protagonists cruise along happily, living and philosophising. Until the last chapter, that is, when insanity comes a-knockin, death close behind. The barely-earned roof crashes burning down, and the Arthurian adventures of Danny's group come shuddering to a smoking stop among the wreckage. I couldn't reccomend it more."
4,Simple and enjoyable.,"Steinbeck's ""Tortilla Flat"" is written in a purposefully simple yet effective language that is easy to read but makes it's point. I like to thing of this novel as ""Steinbeck Lite"" becasue is is a smooth reading book but not as deep as ""Of Mice and Men."" It does touch on important social themes, such as happiness in poverty and different blends of friendship, but is not as important or insightfulas other Steinbeck works. In other words, this book is a good read, but don't expect it to change your life. ""Of Mice and Men"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath"" are better if you have not read them already. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars but I rounded up."
5,Perfect,"Others have already covered the Authurian/Biblical aspects of the novel, but I would reiterate that this is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Rarely do you finish a book and the ending completes it perfectly. This one does. I've read it quite a few times, and always enjoy it."
4,amusing rogues,Tortilla Flat was Steinbecks first successful novel. This episodic collection of stories about a group of rogues on the fringes of society is entertaining but has a deeper message that the unwillingness to grow up and be responsible citizens ultimately ends in tragedy. the episodic nature of the book makes it a little disjointed at times but this is well worth reading
4,Tortilla Flat,"What a band of misfits, but yet they seemed to all have a dream to get out of their ruts...but yet, for just a minute...a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread will give them the attitude of Scarlett, I will think of this tomorrow...and tomorrow never comes...a good friend is forever....as long as there is a roof over your head..."
3,Good in many ways,"I thought that Twenty and Ten was a very realsitic book. The author really took what happened if you were a Jewish child and put it into this story. This book can make you feel many different emotions, including being sad, being happy, and being scared. This book is based on the Holocaust and makes the features in this story appear very true. This book is very convincing, and it is probably one of my favorites!"
3,twenty and ten is a realistic story because......,Tweny and ten is a realstic story because it is based on the war time actions in World War II that have happend in the past. One of the reasons I believe the book is realistic is because alot of people were put in jail as young kids during the War. In this case the kids were put in coal sheds. The author has used many details and discriptions throughout the story. I also think that the author did fantastic research to put together. The book is very interesting because you get an idea and feeling for what the Holocaust was like. The book is very convincing in many different ways.
3,5 grader's review,Mary and her friends live northern France up on a hill. This is a bad time because the Nazis are invading France. Mary and her twenty friends help ten Jewish kids escape from the Nazis. Will Mary and her friends betray the Jewish kids over a bribe?I give this book three stars because it was full of suspense but the beginning and the end were pretty boring.
3,twenty and ten,"I don't think Twenty And Ten is a realistic story. I don't think it is real because there are a couple events in this book that are not realistically portrayed. for example, there are many problems in this book that are solved too quickly, like when the children had no way of knowing how quickly it would take the Nazis to arrive on their bicycles. Or another thing, how did Janet and Philip get to the cave really fast? I also think it is unrealistsic that a boy as young as Louis would have known not to speak.Overall, I think that this book was really good and helps you understand more about the holocaust."
3,Ten and Twenty,"What I thought of the book is that it was good. It was short but I liked it. In the beginning it is not very interesting, but after you get into the book its not so bad. What I like the best about this story is it is suspensful and keeps you wonder what is going to happen next. It also makes you realize how hard it was on those kids during those time."
3,Ten and Twenty,"What I thought of the book is that it was good. It was short but I liked it. In the beginning it is not very interesting, but after you get into the book its not so bad. What I like the best about this story is it is suspensful and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. It also makes you realize how hard it was on those kids during those time."
2,twenty and ten,I liked the book it was ok on descibing the characters. But it was kind of a baby book. I liked the way they dscribed what was going on at the time.
3,very very very very so so,this book is ok besaus of the notsies solders. the children hide the juse. It is scary in some parts of it. u will like it to.
1,Twenty and Ten,Twenty and Ten is a boring book i did not like it made no sense to me. Its about 20 kids that are taken to a school in the hills and 10 jewish kids come to secretly stay with them. Soon after the Nazis come and search for the Jews but dont find them and leave. THE END
5,The Escape from the Soldiers,"I like this book a lot I think it is great. I like all the excitement in it trying to get the Jews away from the soldiers hiding in a hole. I like books that are like that, when you never know what is going to happen all the suspense you keep thinking to your self ""Get out of there!"" thinking that some bad is going to happen to them. I would think that this book is one of the best books that are like it, it is AWESOME!"
4,Both of my copies won't play!,"I bought two copies, one for a friend and we can't get either to work. I think I waited too long to return them also. It says it's for Super Audio CD Players Only. What does that mean? It won't play on my mac or my headset. I've never heard of such a thing Please explain, no one else has mentioned this. Did they change formats since the last reviews?"
2,You get what you pay for.,"Back when I first bought this, my wife and I had just started watching these types of movies. Just imagine a lame rated R movie and add a little bit more/longer sex scenes. The nudity they show could almost be allowed in a rated R movie. This is basically super soft core. It would have been nice if the actors were more attractive as well, but like I said earlier...you get what you pay for. I gave this 2 stars because you get 2 movies."
3,"Points off for ""Love Games""","First of all I was disappointed in the lack of explicit nudity in both of these features. We actually see males ""down there"" a couple of times but the women never.I agree with the other reviewer that ""Confessions"" is by far the better of the two. Much more realistic sex scenes, much better-looking actresses. It's shot in the same fashion asVoyeur, if you've ever seen that series. Sort of a funky and artsy non-linear storytelling fashion with a lot of lines that appear to be improvised. I was pleasantly surprised and would have given this feature four stars on its own.""Love Games"" is a waste. The women are unattractive (barely get above an A cup in the whole cast...seriously), the sex is bland, the storyline is typical. The nudity is really disappointing (not enough rear view). I fast-forwarded through nearly the whole thing. This would be a low three-star, even a two-star, feature on its own.Averaged together I'm giving this three stars."
2,Could of been better.,It was OK but nothing really to write home about. Could of been better. But again.. It could of been worse too.
2,Just get a real P J album,This album isn't really interesting enough to bother with. Most of the songs sound just about the same as the originals except they're not by Polly Jean. Do yourself a favour and buy a real P J album instead. If you've got them all and still want more (I do) go for her collaborations. Little Fish isn't worth a go.
3,24 hours,"They perhaps could have chosen more sholars to represent each case.If you would like more exposition on the Biblical, grammatical, and theological case for 24-hour days, check out [www.answersingenesis.org] and more specifically [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/Genesis.asp]."
3,"Good songs, no great ones","This is a solid album with some very good songs on it, but not one of the songs is great, imo. Miracle Man and Breaking All the Rules come closest, with a bunch of other solid songs on it (Crazy Babies, Hero, Bloodbath in Paradise, Fire in the Sky). However, this album also contains some of Ozzy's worst songs ever, such as Devil's Daughter, Tattooed Dancer, and Demon Alcohol. It took me a long time to get into this album until I realized that if I simply skipped over those three songs, this album is actually pretty good. Again, this is a good album (minus those three bad songs), but not a great one. I would definitely recommend it for all fans of Ozzy and/or Zakk Wylde."
4,not his best,"While not as good as his early solo stuff, it still is good. to me breakin all the rules and fire in the sky are the albums standouts."
5,"""Ozzy still rocks at age 40, & Outdoes his 1986 album""","This Ozzy CD is an under-rated masterpiece of metal! With tracks like ""Crazy Babies"", ""Miracle Man"", ""Fire in the Sky"", ""Breakin' All the Rules"", and ""Bloodbath in Paradise"", it blows away his 1986 album ""The Ultimate Sin"" away. ""The Ultimate Sin"" was considered to be garbage to many rockers of the mid '80's, but this 1988 disc was critically acclaimed to be a return-to-form release by the ex-member of Black Sabbath.With help from Zakk Wylde (guitars), Bob Daisley (bass), and Randy Castillo (drums), Ozzy kicked his glam era in the face and delivered a 9-track metal album that was awesome and full of energy! The new 2002 edition features a live version of the hit single ""Miracle Man (1989)"" & ""The Liar"", which was previously released on a promo-only disc in 1990. These 11 tracks are worth the cash, and still stand the test of time some 15 years later."
3,An average Osbourne album,"Like others already have pointed out, this is not Ozzy Osbourne's most well known release. But this album is better than its reputation, and on ""No rest for the wicked"", there are at least 4 great rockers:Miracle manCrazy babiesTattooed dancerDemon alcoholThe rest of the songs display old Ozzy's rather mediocre side. Apart from his amazing debut ""Blizzard of ozz"", this release is about as good as any other album from the mad man of rock `n' roll."
4,Solid Hard Rock Offering,"Ozzy aquires the remarkable guitarist Zakk Wylde and creates a super charged album with tonnes of energy which is distributed evenly throughout. The track 'Miracle Man' (his stab at tv avangelist Jimmy Swaggert, who actually got caught with a prostitute)is great...since Jimmy used to bash and label Ozzy and various other acts as being nothing but ""devil worshipers"". Great stuff. Other highlights include, 'Crazy Babies', 'Breaking All The Rules' and also interesting but not as good is his song about serial murderer Charles Manson 'Bloodbath in Paradise'. Greatly executed and thought provoking metal/hard rock. Check it out."
3,"It's Ozzy, so it's good. But...","Ozzy achieve that rare status of supremacy, where every single song he (and his partners) write are right on the mark. The trouble here are not the songs. It's the production. It still sounds similar to the awful glam of THE ULTIMATE SIN. That's the real trouble here. The drums sound is bad, lifeless. Zakk is good, but still clearly founding his way into the band. Wizzar rent-a-bassist Bob Daisley apparently was fired after the recording. As for the songs, they're good. Ha, the bonus track is a song called ""HERO"", ok? See ya!"
5,2 words................ZAKK WYLDE!!,"OK I was THE ""Guitar Nerd"" in High School and No Rest for the Wicked was my first Ozzy CD (well, cassette tape back then) Zakks guitar work with that insane vibrato led me to play this tape over and over again till it eventually gave in and ended up buying the CD. As for the songs, sure they're a bit corney now when you listen to them but hey, that was the 80's! Keeping that in mind, I can now sit down and listen to this CD and just smile with ""The Ultimate Sin"" cued up right behind!"
4,"Zakk ""Wylde"" makes this album ""Wild!!!""","This is the first/debut with guitarist Zakk Wylde. The great thing, and the pointer is that this album blows away the""glam"" period Ozzy did with Jake. This is somewhat aparty cd, but there are some great songs here. ""Breaking all the Rules,"" is heavy and rocks, along with ""Miracle Man,""and in particular, ""Fire in the Sky."" This song is one of Ozzy'sbest, and the guitar solo{OH MY GOSH!!!} is one of the bestsolo's I've ever heard. This is a great CD. The reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is because the production could have been better, {especially since it's remastered!} The drums seem drained out in some places, and the ""talk voice"" on ""Miracle Man"" is way too loud. Other than that, this album is part of Ozzy's History, so get it."
3,Ozzy doesn't tinker with formula for success,"Add one dose of Ozzy Osbourne, improved drumming from Randy Castillo, brilliant fireworks from new guitar wunderkind Zakk Wylde and steady bass from longtime Ozzy songwriting parter/studio bassist Bob Daisly and you get a hard rocking, standard Ozzy Osbourne album. This album has several good tracks-""Miracle Man"", ""Devil's Daughter"", ""Blood Bath in Paradise"" and ""Crazy Babies"". The rest of the album is standard hard rock. Zakk brings a fiery style to guitar that was lacking in Jake E. Lee's style. Bob Daisly is a vast improvement over Phil Soussan and Rudy Sarzo on bass. All in all this is a decent and well produced Rock album with some catchy tunes. There is nothing amazing about this album, just more of what you expect from Ozzy."
4,Another great album by ozzy,"I have to say that i like most of his albums and especially his first albums (even with Black Sabbath or with his solo career). This album is no exception. It has amazing songs like: Miracle man - Crazy babies - bloodpath in Paradise. The rest songs lets say that are good. I truly believe that if you like Ozzzy in general or/and heavy metal, then you will like thia album too. Its not an album to love, but definitely not a just ok album. A good work."
4,Ozzy Osbourne - Wickedly Good,"Ozzy's first album with Zakk Wylde on guitar is a nice return to form. Ozzy had hit a bit of a rut in the mid-80's but the presence of Wylde seemed rejuvenate Mr. Osborne and kick everything up a few notches. The collaboration between Wylde and Ozzy would last another 20 years. There are not really any dud songs on this one. The lyrics on songs like ""Breaking All The Rules"", ""Crazy Babies"", and ""Tattooed Dancer"" are a bit rock n roll cliché, but the monster riffs and overall competency of the band more than make up for any lyrical deficiencies. Songs like ""Miracle Man"" (about Rev. Jimmy Swagart), ""Devil's Daughter"", ""Bloodbath In Paradise' (about Charles Manson), and ""Fire In The Sky"" rank up with some of the best stuff Ozzy had done. ""Wicked"" is the album that saw Ozzy transform from the hair metal 80's to the more heavy straight ahead metal of the 90's. One of the Oz man's better releases for sure."
3,Standard Ozzy fare.,"Even though at this point in time Ozzy's voice was showing signs of wear and tear,Zak Wylde's guitar performance takes no prisoners here on tracks such as'Miracle Man','Bloodbath In Paradise'.But there are also some minor cuts here,such as 'Demon Alcohol,making this album one of his heaviest,yet a mixed bag."
2,Great drumming? You gotta be kidding me.,"I think anyone who say that this album has great drumming by Randy Castillo (God bless his soul) must be dreaming. The drumming here is the worst of all Ozzy albums, simply as that. IT's a totally pop-metal drumming, worst still than in THE ULTIMATE SIN.Hearing this Zakk Wylde debut, no one could ever imagine that he would be capable of record NO MORE TEARS after this turkey. NO RET FOR THE WICKED is flat, uninmaginative, cold. THe worst from Ozzy. No wonder it is ""forgotten"", like some other reviewer said. I had great doubts deciding which is the worst OZzy album: THE ULTIMATE SIN (Ozzy himself called this album ""THE ULTIMATE DIM...)or NO REST FOR THE WICKED."
4,no rest for anyone because it's so good,"No Rest for the Wicked is a bit different from the previous Ozzy albums, thanks to a drastically different guitarist. I'm honestly NOT a fan of his playing, but he's good enough for this outing.""Miracle Man"" is definitely a classic, along with ""Fire in the Sky"" and ""Breaking All the Rules"". I'd say, if you're a fan of Ozzy's singing and vocal style, this is a great album.But the guitar playing isn't very good most of the time, even though it's tolerable at least (it would become a screechy, annoying mess on the No More Tears album). For here at least, the guitarist knows not to go overboard and keeps things somewhat simple. It's not as good of an album as the previous four (Blizzard of Ozz through Ultimate Sin) but it's memorable for Ozzy's vocals alone."
3,"""Good But Not The Best""",I Really Like The Song CRAZY BABIES and if your a ozzyfan its a good collector.If you are a new coming ozzyfan I recommend No More Tears Or Ultimate Sin
2,Tin Drums,"It's a little surprising that Ozzy would choose to redo the drums and bass on his first two solo recordings, yet leave this release intact. The drum sound on this recording is simply unacceptable, and the entire production is hopelessly murky, even after a remaster (clearly only AAD). I hope whoever produced this record is no longer employed as a music professional. Poor Zakk Wylde hit the big time, only to have his debute butchered.In terms of song writing, Ozzy was off to a weak start with Zakk. Miracle Man and Tattoed Dancer are great songs, but the rest are as mundane as anything Jake E. Lee came up with on the Ultimate Sin. Perhaps a few attempts to write with Zakk finally resulted in Ozzy's decision to hire other writers by the time of Ozzmosis. It was really sound decision making, because Zakk is an amazing player, if not the most original writer, and it would be a shame to lose him. He's as much a part of Ozzy's sound now as the legendary Randy Rhodes."
1,Prince of dorkness???,"Ozzy was never any good solo, more like pop metal. This is ozzy doing hair metal...oh joy. Ozzy sucks."
2,One of Ozzy's weakest albums,"No Rest For The Wicked was definitely a comedown after the decent The Ultimate Sin album. This is Ozzy's first album with Zakk Wylde on lead guitar and although his playing is impressive, the songs for the most part aren't very good. The first three tracks: ""Miracle Man"", ""Devil's Daughter"", and ""Crazy Babies"" are the strongest tracks on the album. The track ""Hero"", which was untitled on the original release, is also a decent track. The rest of the album consists of unmemorable songs like ""Breaking All The Rules"", ""Tattooed Dancer"", and one of Ozzy's worst tracks ever, ""Demon Alcohol."" The band is top notch, as they are all on of Ozzy's albums, but the songs aren't up to par. I would recommend this fans of Zakk Wylde for the excellent guitar playing but otherwise Ozzy has made much better albums than this one, particularly those with Randy Rhoads."
3,Osbourne Goes Heavier,No Rest For The Wicked is a slightly heavier album for metal legend Ozzy Osbourne. The album is hard rocking and it is not bad but it really doesn't contain any real essential classics. Songs such as Devil's Daughter and Fire In The Sky are well done and Ozzy's voice is in fine form. This album also is the debut for guitarist Zakk Wylde and a definite improvement over Jake E.Lee's playing. A good effort but not in the same class with Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of A Madman.
2,"Sorry, I hate this.","This is nothing compared to his previous works. Actually I am not his loyal fan, but anyway I have liked many of his songs. This is his worst album."
3,SO AND SO....,"After the glam-metal orientated THE ULTIMATE SIN, something must be done. So out to Jake Lee - in to Zakk Wylde. Castillo's drumming is still annoying in this album, but he improved in NO MORE TEARS. The guy has no ""soul"" playing the drums, is something weird, when compared to Lee Kerslake and Tommy Aldridge, I don't know how to explain it properly... Anyway you looke at it is just an average Ozzy album, but with more guts than BARK AT THE MOON and THE ULTIMATE SIN. Please, don't try to compare it with BLIZZARD OF OZZ...It's impossible. BLIZZARD is, and always will be, Ozzy and Randy supreme masterpiece."
4,"Nice finale, Great beginning.","I was getting a little down on the New Earth series. After a great beginning with ""Wagon Trail to the Stars"", the series became repetitive with ""Oh NO, trouble, prepare to evacuate the planet, yet again"". This book had none of that foolishness. Taking center stage was a new group of Not-Ready-For-Primetime heroes that gel and form the next great adventures. This is a diverse group that doesn't fit the typical Star Trek mold yet, a group that I soon began to care about and hopefully, will have further opportunities to learn more about. It is my hope that with the demise of Star Trek television that this new jumping on point would lend itself nicely to television. A new crew of fresh faces wouldcut production (salary) cost and make for great stories. I enjoyed this book, look forward to further adventures, and hope that enough of that famous Star Trek support get behind these characters and let Paramount know we need are Star Trek fix."
4,Changing of the Guard,"With Challenger, the New Earth saga comes to a very nice finish. All plot lines are tied up (some unfortunately so), a new ship and crew take over from the Enterprise, and all is well. All being well is the problem. I dont know if this was set up to be a story on it's own, or a launch of yet a new Star Trek series. As a finale it comes short of target, but works great if it is an introductory tale of the Challenger and her crew. This particular ship and crew I wouldnt mind seeing again, just like those of the Excalibur. These new faces are fun, a refreshing change from the same adventures of Kirk, Spock, and company. I hope a visit to the Sagitarius cluster comes again soon."
3,Middle of the Road,"I'd classify this as a typical Diane Carey novel--roughly 50% longer than it needs to be and full of unnecessary and confusing sailor lingo. Diane also seemed to switch between writing styles, writing at times almost as one would speak.The story itself was decent and did a nice job of wrapping everything up and setting up for a potential new series (that never really materialized). I wasn't real crazy about what I would consider to be a deus ex machina ending, but once the story got going it kept my attention."
2,Star Trek : New Earth - book six of six [ Challenger ],"I have read all six of these books. One thru five were verry entertainig and well structured, however somewhat predictable. book six was none of these besides predictable."
3,Great book (bad spelling in the kindle edition),This is a really great book of Agatha Christie. I just hate the many spelling errors in the kindle edition. I don't feel like spending any more money on Agatha Christie kindle books. They are all like this.
3,A little confusing,"This book revolves around the Renauld family & it deviates from the usual AC novels. First of all, there is another detyective M. Giraud (who, of course, despises Poirot's old-fashioned way of dealing with things) & Hastings falls in love, not with a red-head ;-), but with...ok, i won't spoil it, by telling u who it is. The plot is not a straight-forward one, but one involving many twists & turns. Just when u think you've caught the murderer, there appears another one. On the whole, a good read but not one of her best."
3,Early book; not hit her stride yet; worth reading for fans,"A fan's book. Many are better but Agatha is Agatha, none like her."
2,bad,"this book starts promising developments and in the middle of book,you say yourself ,very good book,very exciting and very complicated.towards end,writer is befogging you.but it doesnt perplex you as another books.well starts,badly finishes.if you have oppurtinity,watch its film.it is much beter than book.film have very scenes that book didnt have.but if you have a target like reading all books of her books like me,the read it.but if you are new-starter for AGATHA CHRISTIE,read crooked house,murder of roger ackroyd or mirror cracked."
4,Lethal Links,I am alone in trying to solve these novels before the end? Reading Agatha Christie novels leaves me constantly backtracking to find clues. This time I struck pay dirt!I solved the murder based on circumstance and irrelevant clues. The real reason for the guilt of the murderer is actually based on the suspect revealing a hidden fact early on that no one else knew. The problem with many of these clues is that they assume facts that the reader does not know. In this case facts that the suspect knew that no one else knew could have easily been bad perception or a deceit played upon the suspect.In any case just sit back and enjoy the intrigue of a beach side golf resort in roaring twenties France.
4,Another fun murder/mystery from Agatha Christie,"Poirot Book 2 is a quick twisty mystery that races across Europe. Set when it was written in the early '20s, you get back to the basics of crime scene investigating; where all the clues can be seen and deciphered with nothing more technological than a magnifying glass. It's a fresh break from all of the biotech mysteries and CSI shows that flood today's media."
5,great story telling,"I have read more than a dozen Agatha Christie mysteries (including her most famous ones), and so far Murder on the Links is my personal favorite. I like the fast pace of this story. No excessive dialogues between characters that don't have much to do with the murder. Rather than taking on chapters after chapters to develop the characters before the murder, the first murder takes place very early in the book, before the main characters show up. Then we get to follow Poirot's deductive process in solving the crime as all the suspects and their relationships are introduced one by one. The book is pure joy and I stayed up late to finish it."
3,Great novel but serious formatting issues,"First, let me say that the novel Murder on the Links is a fantastic novel. Lots of twists and turns, a mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end. If you are a mystery fan, you will love this novel.However, I was quite disappointed with the Kindle version. The book was riddled with typos and formatting problems. In the first part of the book, the problems were minor but the further I read in the book the spelling errors were more numerous. By the end, they got downright distracting. Had this been a free book, I probably wouldn't complain but since I paid for it, I was tremendously disappointed."
3,Hercule vs. Holmes?,"A body that should be discovered and a variety of possibilities make this book a solid Poirot mystery. The competition between Poirot and a young detective who uses ""scientific methods"" such as investigating tobacco ash appears to be a shot at another famous detective. More could have been done with this but Christie usually wastes little time with character development. Hastings is even dimmer than usual in this one, but the mystery is a good one and not too obvious."
2,Bad Conversion,"The first part of the text is fine, but then the conversion program missed an end italics and the bulk of the book is in italic. Very annoying and hard to read."
3,Pretty good,"This is my second Agatha Christie book and I thought it was pretty good. I liked that just when you think you have it all figured out you realize you don't. That's the beauty of quality mystery writers as opposed to your dime a dozen writers you find in the grocery store aisle. I don't think this was the best book I read, but I felt the time I spent reading it was thoroughly well spent."
4,"murder, passion, deceit, and true love, served with ample red herrings","In this, Agatha Christie's third novel and Hercule Poirot's second appearance (afterThe Mysterious Affair at Styles), the author and her detective continue to delight and dizzy. Poirot and Hastings travel to France to investigate a murder and we think we've reached the bottom of it...about five times. I'd never have guessed the actual solution, but watching Poirot at work and Hastings being wowed by the ladies and not as quick on the case (he's the reader - i.e., me or you - in the novel, the one we can relate to!) was the real pleasure anyway. We get the added treat of a brief ethical dilemma: to shield a loved one at what cost to myself? and what cost to a third party? Rapidly resolved by the marvelous, fastidious Poirot.It's notThe Murder of Roger Ackroydnor even probablyPeril at End House, but I thoroughly enjoyed the ride."
5,Stick With It!,"I've recently started reading the Christie mysteries I've missed along the way, including this, her second full-length Poirot. I found it tough going at times, somewhat confusing...but I've rarely been so blown away by the denouement of a whodunit! I can only imagine that this was the book that cemented Christie's reputation after her debut with ""The Mysterious Affair At Styles."" Sure, the writing is old-fashioned (it was written in the late 20s, after all), but the intricacies of the plot and the way Christie keeps you off-base and guessing until the very end are simply stunning. You may not have heard of this Christie (it was new to me), but it truly ranks up there with ""...Roger Ackroyd"" and ""...the Orient Express"" for sheer suprise value."
4,"Durable, pretty well designed","This is a pretty narrow diameter pump. If you have narrow tires, that will be fine, if you have a mountain bike or other larger tires though, be prepared to make close to 100 pumps to fill your tire (about 120 pumps for a 2.25 in wide tire). Connection to the tube is great, and it seals on the first time with no leakage. The base of the handle has an internal mechanism where in the closed position you turn it a quarter turn and it locks in place so it won't accidentally extend when you aren't using it. This sounds great in theory, but when actually pumping you can sometimes feel it trying to catch as you finish each pump. Not really a problem, just a little annoying sometimes. Still, despite all that I think as far as functionality and ease of use, this is a great little pump. Very durable too."
4,It's good for emergencies,"This thing is small and light. That means that it is easy to carry around to pump up flats. It also means that it takes an awful lot of pumps to fill a 26"" x 2"" tire. You should have a regular size pump at home."
5,very solid mini pump,I over researched mini pumps as I over research everything that I buy. I think I got the best one for the money. The look is very sharp! I was dissapointed that they were not available in plain black but a lot of the pumps were grey and this was one that was mostly solid steel looking. The pump is very small (not the smallest mini pump) but definitely able to fit in your back jersey pocket or easily fit on your bike with the water bottle cage. It is very lightweight and seems very sturdy. I am just hoping that I do not have to use it too much.
3,Disturbing,"I listened to the audio book which made it easy to skip forward and forego much of the story that was disturbing. There were too many characters' first names that began with the same letter - too many ""B's"", etc - which made the story confusing. The story line centers around a group of people known as Tohono O'odham, People of the Desert, who are known as aboriginal Americans, previously known as Papago. There are some tortuous events that take place in the book and I didn't really need to know the torrid details nor did I want to know them. The ending of the book is abrupt as though the author ran out of ideas. By the end of the book, I wanted the perpetrators of the crime to pay for what they had done, within reason. All in all Jance tells a good story, but I hope she doesn't continue to write this particular kind of book."
2,Too many characters.,"CD/Unabridged/Mystery: Too many characters. Too many meaningless flashbacks. This audio would have been so, so much better if it was abridged. I'm never going to listen or read another Brandon Walker novel. I'll stick with Joanna Brady.This one had too many issues. The narrator was find, but the book is full of background details to characters that have no real purpose to the plot and solving the murders. The ending was extremely anti-climatic and a letdown. The bad guys get off way too easy.Also, DON'T CUT THE UMBILICAL CORD! If someone is has a baby in a car, go to the hospital and let a doctor cut the cord! Don't use a unsterilized knife; even with the ends tied, there can be a major infection! I was yelling at these idiots."
1,Incomprehensible,"Normally I like J.A. Jance, but this book was an incomprehensible hodgepod of characters and meandering plot line. The author introduced so many characters so fast who had no association with each other, and then didn't mention them again till so far later one couldn't even remember them. They range from an ex county sheriff to an Indian girl who suddenly realizes her mother had a lesbian affair with a former Benedictine nun. One can only thing that there was a deadline fast approaching and the book had to be written FAST."
2,Just too dark and on the sick side for me,"Actually, I think there are writers who can get away with this type of a story, but J. A. Jance isn't one of them. It's too bad because I am sure she was trying to make a point, but this book is just too depressing when one is expecting a Summer read type of book from her. I do give the lady credit for attempting to capture the Native American spirit here, but as a William Kent Kruger fan, she just doesn't cut the mustard this time."
3,Okay Crime Novel,Day of the dead was an entertaining crime novel. I didn't care for any of the characters very much. It is a B mystery.
1,day of the dead,"I love mysteries and read an excerpt from one of J. A. Jance's books 'Death of a Snowbird' in book that I had purchased. It sounded good and I couldn't find it so I purchased this one. I'm very disappointed in this book. Way too graphic...I felt like I was reading a nasty porno murder. I don't know what other's expected but I expected a really good mystery. This isn't what I experienced. A good mystery doesn't need to be this graphic. I stopped reading it at 117 pages and at this time realized that I could never recommend it to anyone I know. Sorry, but it doesn't live up to the truly great authors like Ellis Peters and Tonly Hillerman."
1,An Ugly Book,"I've been a fairly loyal reader of Jance's Brady and Beaumont books. I don't think I will be in the future. In buying this one I feel was trapped by my past loyality. I struggled with this to page 175 and then quit. Now I'll probably use it for fireplace kindling as I'll NOT give this book to anyone I know. The subject's Ugly, many of the people are Ugly and the writting is contrived and predictably Ugly.Why in the world would Ms Jance impose this uglyness on her readers.Nice cover though."
2,Loyal Jance fan but greatly disappointed in this book,"I want to start by saying that I am a diehard Jance fan. I love the JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady novels but I found this one so disturbing that I gave it up after 100 pages and just flipped to the end.Why? It was very gory, graphic and disturbing. I, personally, felt no reason to have included such graphic, detailed child rape and murder scenes. The bottle scene and others were just too much for me.When I read, I want to be entertained with a good story, perhaps some humor... and I don't want nightmares. This one definitely could give a sensitive soul nightmares for days.I'm not giving up on Jance but, I disagree with another review, I don't see this character being her most memorable. It's just not a comfortable read."
2,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I discovered J. A. Jance 4 years ago and have read every book she's written. This one is definitely the worst. The first hundred pages are spent introducing a myriad of characters and their histories (from her previous books). Very confusing. Very fragmented. If I were a first time reader of Jance, I would have stopped reading this book - but I persevered and finished reading it. I would not recommend this book to anyone -but I would definitely recommend anything else that Jance has written. She fell on her face on this one."
1,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of the Joanna Brady and J. P. Beaumont series, so I was looking forward to curling up with this book. I never read the first two of the Walker series but I was sure I was going to like this one. My goodness! What a horror! The description of the torture perpetrated on the orphan was so disgusting that I had to leave the book alone. I never went back to it. I like to read for pleasure and this was no pleasure. I will only read the Brady and Beaumont series from now on unless they get very gory."
3,Caution: Too Scary for Joanna Brady Fans!,"This series is several shades darker than Jance's Joanna Brady and J.P. Beaumont books, so if you're a fan of those books, just be warned that this series is different. I chose this book because I was attracted to the Native American spiritual themes and because I liked those other series. For me it was a mistake--I was looking for some light vacation reading, but this story was so creepy that it cast a pall over my whole vacation. Maybe I should have known better, but it's hard to tell from the cover blurbs--all mysteries seem to try to make themselves sound scary!Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the parts about Indian family life and spirituality were the best parts. The ending was disappointing--too much shoot-'em-up, too many bodies dropping too fast. It would have been more satisfying, and less trite, to me to see the evildoers--especially when they're as evil as this--exposed to the community and brought to justice."
1,DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR,"I BELIEVE I HAVE READ ALL OF JANCE'S BOOKS BUT IF THERE ARE ANY MORE LIKE THIS ONE, SHE WILL LOSE ME. I THINK THERE IS ENOUGH DISGUSTING REALLIFE CRIMES IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT A FICTION WRITER RESORTING TO SUCHTRASH. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE GOOD GUYS GOING AFTER THE BAD GUYS WITHOUT ALL THE MORBID SEX AND VIOLENCE? HER BOOKS ABOUT THESHERIFF JOANNA AND OF BEAUMONT ARE SO GOOD. THERE IS NO NEED FOR ALL THE TRASH IN THIS BOOK!"
1,A prime example of a 'trashy novel',"This book is an overly long look at extreme sexual abuse of children by a pillar of the community and his ghoulishly evil wife.That would be bad enough.But this author wraps all this up in a totally irrelevant hodgepodge of verbage trying in vain to link mostly Mexicans and one American Indian victim.She is determined to prove she knows Indian words and customs which are of no interest and completely unrelated to the so-called plot.This 'trash' could be likened to the work of an infinite number of chimpanzees randomly tapping on keyboards.Actually, I think it would only take one chimp. And it would probably be a far more intelligent read.Why no zero star option - or negative number ratings?"
1,Way too much gratuitous violence and sex,"Unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problem putting this book down. It was so repulsive I took it out and threw it into the trash can after about 100 pages then came in the house and washed my hands. There was way too much gratuitous sexual violence explicitly laid out for the reader that I felt I was being nearly raped myself. Awful, just awful. Not typical Jance at all. And, having seen this side of her, I just don't know that I can go back to Joanna Brady and J.P. Beaumont after reading this. I'm too afraid I'll come across this pornography again.It was also very difficult keeping up with all the native words and phrases (and their meanings) that were used repeatedly throughout the book and too many story lines to keep track of.It's back to Miss Marple and Poirot for me this reader."
1,Awful!,I threw this book away! This book is like a bad movie that uses violence and sex instead of acting to make a movie. This is not what I have come to expect from J. A. Jance. I had no interest in any of the characters and the violence from the Strykers was so over the top that it just made me sick.Ms. Jance what were you thinking?
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad",I have read every book written by Ms Jance and have enjoyed each one. Not this one. I read for intertainment before bed and this book is truly not what you are use to with Sheriff Brady or Detective Beaumont. Don't waste your money on this bad bad book. Save it and maybe Sheriff Brady will again appear.
1,holster - uncle mikes,They sent a left handed holster - picture is incorrect - called Optic Sale and spoke to Alex - customer service - he was out of the right handed holster ordered and maybe I would like a more expensive one. He would check and get back to me when the one I wanted would be available - still no call - I placed two more calls and no one answered - left maessage and they are not returning the call - would buy uncle mikes holster just not from Optic Sale.
4,"Secure holster, great price here.","Great holster for open carry or use at the range, holds a 1911 well. Secure strap with strong snap for thumb break or just to keep the gun in the holster. Strong belt loops but would be better with a strong clip to belt. Not for CCW"
1,different item sent,"What was shipped is NOT what is pictured on the Amazon site. A wast of time. I had to contact the company to find out they where out of stock, a lot of time wasted and then when it arrived, it was the wrong item, NOT EVEN CLOSE to what is pictured. Very disapointed!"
4,Works great,I purchased the left handed version for my Ruger P95 and it fits my gun perfectly. Couple notes on Amazon's description of the item. It states it is an ambidextrous holster when it isn't. You order either a left or right hand version. It also states it includes aclip to switch it to in the pant holster by flipping the enclosed clip. The holster doesn't come with a clip to do this. Other than these two items it is a great holster that works just like I need it too.
4,"Size 14 fits Ruger MK II with 6 7/8"" barrel","I had this same holster for 20 years, when finally the belt loop broke. Today, the design is still the same. It's made of plastic. Hopefully the materials they use are more durable now. The Size 14 fits a Ruger MK II with 6 7/8"" barrel. Since the case is still new, it's still tight and the back sight gets caught on the case when holstering. The button is hard to button and unbutton, but I feel these issues will work themselves out over time. Overall, good holster."
4,Pretty good holster for the money,"Picked up the size 11 for my old trusty Hi-Standard Double Nine Longhorn .22 Revolver. Fits great, & comfortable to wear. Had a hard time finding a affordable holster for this long barrel revolver. Tough material. I'm happy with this purchase."
4,Uncle Mike does it again,"Purchased this holster not knowing how it would work with my revolver,my gun fits great in the holster. The strap is perfect, but needs to be shortened a bit, but that will be an easy task. In all it is a great holster and would advise anyone who wants to purchase good holsters at a great price to go with Uncle Mikes."
3,Retaining Strap is a PAIN,"Overall, this is a nice holster for the price. However, the retaining strap is the pits. It is too wide and too long. I have played around with the straps and can't find a good way to use them and still be able to get the gun out quickly. As a result, I am now considering cutting the stinking straps off."
3,not balanced very good,"This holster is ok. I got it for a Taurus .357 medium frame revolver (6"" barrel). The gun fits good in it, the only thing is that the weight of the gun handle causes the holster to tip backwards a bit."
1,too small,this size 1 as described by uncle mikes website is wrong. it says it is for medium autos i bought it for a sig p239. doesnt fit. tried my walther p22. doesnt fit. tried my smith and wesson j frame. doesnt fit. honestly i have no idea what this will fit??????
4,Good holster,"I actually got this for a large 8"" airsoft revolver as a prop for my Rick Grimes from the Walking Dead costume. It holds the plastic revolver well and in place very snugly. My only issues were the belt loop was too small and the back strap likes to come undone too easily."
4,Holster fit,I originally ordered this for my P97 but it didi not fit. Fortunately it fits my SR40 quite like a glove. I do wish a better description was provided on these items.
5,One of the best Mysteries I have ever read,"This is the first and only Victoria Holt book I have read yet. I love mysteries and read them often. Of all mysteries I have read this is one of the best. I liked it so much sometimes I would stay up into the early hours of the morning because I could not put it down. It is a wonderful book, give it a try.I have plans to read many more of her books. She is one of the top authors on my list of favorite authors."
5,Music CD purchase,Product was shipped quickly & received in excellent condition. A quality product and good buying experience!
2,Music of the Night????????,"I really liked the idea of a highlights cd; however, The Music of the Night is not the same one that is on the original two-disc cd. The words aren't even the same. If you enjoy Music of the Night, skip this cd. Otherwise, this cd would be 5 stars."
2,Doesn't live up,"If, like me, you have not seen the broadway show, and are attracted to this CD because of one or two cuts, don't buy it! There are only two ""listenable"" pieces of music on this CD, the others are so wound into the action of the show that they don't mean anything to the casual listener. Further, many don't have an enjoyable melody. They're not the kind of thing you walk around humming to yourself. Sarah Bightman has a thin voice, too much vabrato, and poor diction. I love broadway music, but this was a real disappointment to me. Perhaps the full soundtrack would have satisfied better."
5,A long time favorite,"This is one of my most treasured CDs. The voices of the cast are incredible! ""Think of Me"" and ""All I Ask of You"" are 2 of my favorites. If you enjoy the story behind Phantom, yu will like this soundtrack."
2,Don't Waste Your Time With HIGHLIGHTS!,"I give this recording only two stars, because you flat out should not buy it. Buy the double cd Original London Cast instead- I give that recording 5 stars. If you buy this recording you will miss out on A LOT of great music, and some thrilling moments that aren't on the highlights.Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh is not on the highlights and that's worth the price of the double cd alone. I love that song and it's where Carlotta gets it good..and Crawford is haunting as usual during this part.Highlights for any musical are a waste. It's worth it to pay more and get as much of the music as possible.Do yourself a favor and get the double cd, not this one."
5,Best CD ever~!,I'm completely obsessed about this CD.. I mean I listen to it every night! It is great...the best!! Buy it!
5,THIS IS THE BEST TAPE IN THE WORLD,THIS IS THE Best play/cd in the world I saw the play then I just had to get the cd!!! I think others would love this as a birthday present
3,Sound quality not the best,"I had a cassette version of this original cast album that I played in an older car and the sound seemed better. That is perception but one thing is for certain today. In playing most other music CDs in my current car's high quality sound system, the Phantom CD's sound quality, in comparison, is not as good."
5,absolutely fabulous!,"this album is very inspiring.haunting and sad. it makes you feel like your there not only watching the performance,but actualy a part ,as if it happened in real life and you were there.you can really feel the characters pain,hope,joy dispare and many other emotions.i give this a definite 5 stars! i was inpired when i saw the live performance in England i cried and the album does the same to me it is BRILLIANT! SIMPLY BRILLIANT! i could listen to it forever!"
5,I listen to this all of the time and never get tired of it!,"my family got high lights from the phantom of the opera a few years ago and i love it! i listen to it a lot and never get bored. there are some songs that are increadably haunting, and some up beat and cheerful, its a wonderful mix. i can't say enough good things about it... i can't wait to see the show its self!"
4,Good highlights album with some different lyrics,I have both the two-disc cast album and this highlights album. I love listening to this one as I drive. But I wonder if someone can explain to me why the lyrics to Music of the Night are different on this album than on the 2-disc recordings and from the libretto. You hear some additional stanzas in this recording that are not in the stage production. I actually really love the added lyrics but just not sure why they were added to this particular CD.
3,Lovely music in an acceptable collection,"The songs are lovely, and brings back to you fond memories if you have been to the show. But apparently over the years the lyrics have been changed, so what you hear today at the show is not exactly what you hear in the CD.The recording quality is quite below par. The sound levels are very different from song to song, and sometimes the singers' voices are overtaken by the orchestra's.I personally also think that the three singer's voice characteristics are not a good match."
3,What Happened To Music Of The Night?,"This would have been a great CD. It has all the hit songs with the lengthy dialog cut out. You are able to hear all the great songs in about 60 minutes, rather then listening to the 90 minute, two disk set. HOWEVER!- Music Of The Night is a drastically different version then the one I am used to hearing. It is a vocal/piano solo and I love the sound of the piano, so I had no problem with that. But they changed the lyrics of the song. The lyrics do no match those on the 2 disc set and if you are used to hearing that version, you will surely find this one jarring to listen too. I almost wonder if they did it so you would be forced to buy the 2 disk set to get the original. But if Music Of The Night is not your favorite song, then you will certainly enjoy the rest of the album."
5,Andrew Lloyd Webber's BEST!,"I have just recently seen the ""Music Box Company""'s version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"". One of the best plays ever, no doubt about it. I am now currently reading the book, to understand the play better. YOU MUST SEE/LISTEN TO THIS PLAY!"
4,Wish Sarah Brightman didn't use so much vibrato.,"I really enjoy everything I have ever heard by Andrew Lloyd Webber. I like ""Phantom"" a lot, but in my opinion this album was ruined by Sarah Brightman. Just listen to the sample of ""Angel of Music."" Love this musical, but get a different recording of it."
3,"Nothing new, but a couple really hot babes save it!","If you're familiar w/ the products of Peach, Vivid's soft-core division, you'll know what you're getting w/ this one. In a nutshell, some decent babes, a couple real hotties, and some sexy skin in dance vignettes & that type stuff. Nothing awesome, but nice.This one's good - not enough pink (never is), but hot fun. One vignette features a busty, double D babe washing a car that is worth the price by itself.Nice item, pick it up cheap, enjoy & sell it back on amazon."
5,American Literature is Back,"I've been a fan of Walter Kirn since, well, since he was writing short stories on a Smith Corona back in the early 80's.Thumbsucker is a triumph -- not only for Kirn but for anyone who believes that literature works through its honest, elegant simplicity rather than bombastic language, terrorist bombings, or thinly veiled celebrity charades. The book functions like a fractal, where micro-moments reflect a greater whole. A string of entertainingly human scenes end up crystalizing into something with greater impact than one could possibly expect.Less is so much more."
2,Boring ... Good Thing It's a Fast Read,"I had relatively high expectations; lots of 4 and 5 star reviews on line, the newspapers loved it, the consensus seemed to be ""hilarious."" I found very little entertaining in this book. The characters alternated between flaky and cliche, and the story never once even caused me to crack a smile. I tried in vain to detect some sort of existential underpinning here -- Justin's oral obsession as a reaction to his reluctance to act, his choosing not to choose. This was never flushed out (and may not have been intended; alas, opportunity lost). The plot was horrendously thin, the characters flat, the story completely unengaging. The novel didn't raise any questions and didn't ask me to think about anything. Did the writer even have a message? I give 2 stars because (mercifully) I finished it in one night."
2,There Are Worse Habits,"THUMBSUCKER started off great--I liked the narrator Justin from the first page. But then it sort of fizzled. I gave it two stars only because, like Saturday Night Live, it just didn't sustain the humor and energy that grabbed me in the beginning.The funniest passage is his description of a nocturnal trip in his grandparents' motorhome.There were a few other sections where I laughed out loud, but it always seemed that the reader was held at arm's length, so I couldn't feel Justin's adolesence anguish. I think this book would have been much better if it had been edited a little more tightly, or if the grandparents--and other peripheral characters--had more page-space.Read this if you're going on a long bus trip. It's not a great book, but it's not a bad book, either."
3,One Thumb Up,"Oral fixations, family dysfunctions and other psychobuzzian concepts plump out the story of Justin's high school years in Walter Kirn's Thumbsucker. Thumb sucking, whiskey drinking, fly fishing, toke smoking and bible thumping play a big part in this story which is less about coming of age, and more about resisting coming of age. Walter Kirn's prose is clear and interesting and the Midwestern setting vivid. But his characterization of Justin is inconsistent. I found it very difficult to understand what motivated Justin as Kirn sped him through the years of his adolescence. On one page he was out to score pot and a scant hundred pages later he was striding up a mountain to save his father's life with scarcely any explanation for his behavior in between.Although the incidents of this book were fun to read, they didn't work together well as a novel, so I can't quite give it two thumbs up."
5,a breath of fresh air,"having visited the US and Canada in 1997 and being facinated by the country and native Americans,I picked this up at my video store and the whole family loved it;the story ,the actors,the scenery,the concept (would that it could happen) and the dog.we have a blue Australian cattle dog whose father was red so the red -blue heeler stumpy tail added to the movie for us.The version I hired in Australia didn't have the narration and having seen both version,I prefer the version without because you can then just lose yourself in the story.But that's a minor distraction in a fine and entertaining movie."
5,Better than expected,"The movie arrived on time and in great shape, all in all it was better than expected."
1,Last of the Dogmen review,I saw this movie on TV and wanted my own DVD. I ordered the DVD but found out it was not suitable for US players. Sent the DVD back. Very disappointed with the whole process. The DVD for US players is very expensive now so I will wait until it is more reasonabley priced.
1,OLD,"Ordered and received just fine, upon receiving....it would not play in my dvd player..it is region 2 and I live in region 1....I just didn't know there were regions, this old lady in Oklahoma learned a difficult and expensive lesson."
3,Kristen,"I still do not own this movie but have rented it a few times and greatly enjoyed the story. One of the things I liked most about the movie was Tom Beringer's dog Zip, a tri-colored Australian Cattle Dog. I attribute this movie to me now owning two of these awesome dogs. They are smart, loyal companions just as the dog in the movie is."
2,last of the dog men,"Not happy with it, No one told me that it was comming from out of the U.S.A. so now it will not play in my dvd player. I will ont buy from you again NOT HAPPY!!!!"
1,Do Not Order - Unless You Don't Want Your Money Refunded,"The video was ordered as a Christmas present. I only ordered one item and received two. One from the United Kingdom and one from a New Jersey firm. The one I received from the UK indicated that it ws for a Region 2 DVD player only, had additional packaging and warned against opening unless we had a Region 2 DVD player. I was able to return the DVD (less $3.63 shipping out-of-pocket expense and an approximate $3.60 restocking fee). The second DVD ""looked normal"", and had no warning. However, when attempting to play the DVD we got the message ""not for this Region"". This company would not accept a return because Amazon had a disclaimer stating that it was for Region 2 DVD players only. I had merely checked the box ""Add to Cart"" and never saw the disclaimer. Thus, I am out approximately $32.94 and have nothing. I will not order from Amazon again."
2,"horrible dialogue, bad white actors","This movie may have good scenery and the Indians acceptably portrayed (kept mysterious), but the white actors (onscreen 90% of the time) were terrible, and their dialogue was worse - just cheesy, un-believable two-bit Hollywood portrayals. I was looking for a meaningful Indian movie like Powwow Highway or Thunderheart and was misled by reviews. This is nothing like Dances with Wolves, which was thoughtful. This movie is not thoughtful, and has a third-rate script. Dances with Wolves also had the Indian dialogues translated so we could empathize with the Lakota, whereas I'm glad the dialogue in Cheyenne was left ""untranslated"" by the scriptwriter - it surely would have removed any remaining merit from the movie."
4,"Gorgeous, magical movie","I watch this every time it comes around on cable. The sub-plot is a wonderfully subtle love story, but you know it's going to happen. The main theme is about two unlikely people teaming up to search for a ""lost tribe,"" each for their own reasons. The scenery is magnificent, the characters are perfectly matched, even the dog is great. Don't miss this movie."
3,Last of the Dogmen,"I was flipping channels during the Olympics and came across this movie on a local independent station. The movie captured my attention enough to watch most of it. I had no idea what was happening at first, so I decided to look it up in the television guide from our newspaper. The movie critic who rates these for the Pioneer Press gave it one star. At first I was inclined to agree as Tom Berenger is really a second rate character actor.But the movie grew on me. I found it engaging and entertaining, what else should a movie be? My emotions swayed with the events on the screen. I felt anger at the Indians then sympathy. The story line is off of mainstream, but I like that. There is no chance of a corny sequel and I also like that. This is a good movie and it is worth a look. Tom Berenger still can't act, but the movie absorbed his weaknesses well."
1,last of the dogmen,"DVD arrived and clearly stated on the package that it is unable to be viewed in my region, so it was a waste of $20+."
1,disaster,"I was sent a DVD that was not compatible with American made players...I wrote to the company in the UK, told them they should have noticed my address before shipping the DVD, they replied it wasn't their problem. I tried to get it to work, but one option was 'at my own risk' - who's gonna try that one with a Sony DVD Blue Ray player!So I now own a DVD I cannot use."
1,UnPlayable,"Due to the european formatting, I was unable to play Last of the Dogmen. I think Amazon should have placed some sort of warning about this different formatting."
1,I will never order with Amazon again!,"I ordered a movie and I live in Colorado Springs, CO. I was sent a movie that will only work in Europe. Guess I should have explained that Colorado is in the United States. I will never order with Amazon again."
1,"Last of the Dogmen, REGION 2",I LOVE this movie however I did not scroll down to read the RED fine print that it could not be played in the U.S. I think Amazon should put this info at the TOP of the display for ignorant customers like me. I had to put it in the trash along with shipping charges.
1,Last of the Dogmen,This was a region 2 item and no where did it state exactly what that meant. Basically it wont play on DVD players in the USA. I have asked for my money back and up to date I have had no response. I am disappointed and I had ordered 2.
4,Region 2 dvd will play in PC...,"I too bought this dvd without realizing it was in a region 2 format and will not play in a region 1 player. Tried it in my dvd player and of course it would not play. Then tried to play in my Gateway pc and at first had no luck until I opened it in my ""Powerdvd"" player witch I got for free from cyberlink. Anyway it played perfectly in video and audio.It also played in Realplayer and VLC media players, Hope this helps.. It is a great movie..."
3,It was ok until ...,"halfway thru ... when Tom had to go all the way back to town to steal some penicillin.Ridiculous.The Medical Industrial Complex had to insert this assinine propaganda into an otherwise plausible story ...Sad that Tom went along with this bull**** that the Indian would have died unless he took an a 'miracle' invention of the white man (an antibiotic).Also, the part where Tom's handcuffs magically disappeared when he fell into the river .....If they were 'loose' he would have had them off before the standoff scene.Ah well, beautiful scenery (Banff Canada and Mexico), beautiful actors and the best part .. the Indians escaped.I would have given it one more star if they would have left out the white man drug skit."
1,Poor condition,Movie didn't play properly for at least 3 to 4 minutes. Would not say this was in good condition as described.
1,Last of the Dogmen Region 2,I did not realize that it said Region 2 on it. Then we didn't know what Region 2 meant for a long time. Nobody else did either. We ask in several places. It says Region 2 in real small letters on the back of the case. I will send it back as it hasn't been played or anything. I want one that would play in my DVD but I don't want to pay $100.00 for it...Sorry.....
1,Region2 Last of The Dogmen,"I ordered this Dvd not knowing what region2 means.most of the population has no idea there is even a region2,1,3 or 4.so now i am stuck with a dvd i cant watch.i would like to send it back but not at my expense.i love amazon and love ordering from you.help me out here please."
5,Last of the Dogmen,I can never get enough of this movie! I will watch it every time it is on TV. Now if I am to anxious to wait for it I can watch it any time since I own it!!
1,Last Of The Dogmen REGION 2 DVDs,"Please be aware that DVDs that are formatted REGION 2 WILL NOT play in most dvd players in the United States. This is an entertaining movie, but you have to get the dvds formatted REGION 1."
1,The LAst of The Dogmen,"Why bother to buy this? It won't play on any dvd sold in the US or Canada!!It is a waste of money. Why wasn't this made obvious when I bought it? Saying REGION 2 means nothing to the buyer. SPELL IT OUT SO WE DON""T GET ROOKED!!!!"
5,R-2 DVD Last of the Dogmen,"This is a Region-2 DVD that worked like a charm on my ALL REGION DVD player. Shipment was on time, goods ( sealed and new ) as promised. I saved quite a bit of money do to the fact that the US REGION ONLY title of this DVD is 3-4 times what I payed this vendor.It's a great movie, saw it once, had to have it. A modern day Cowboy / Indian movie - Love story - action adventure, that will give you reasons to think.My opinion, GREAT acting by Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey and OTHERS. I believe this story line COULD / MIGHT have happen."
3,DVD Problem,"This is a GREAT movie! However, the DVD itself only works on European DVD players and I live in the USA. I was able to get the DVD to work on my computer."
1,Deadbeat Amazon Merchant,I can not give you a review because MELVINMIKLTOST did not send me the DVD and I am out $35 bucks...
3,"Good movie, but bad language unnecessary.","I enjoyed this movie, but the bad language is totally unnecessary. I do not know why producers and directors think that a movie should take God's name in vain. Even the lady curses. Aside from the bad language, I give it three stars for being a good story and the vistas are beautiful. The actors are professional. They should not curse."
1,Was not pleased at all,I did not like the movie I received because you can only watch it on a computer and not on a DVD player. I will never purchase anything from this seller again. It was a Christmas gift and the person I gave it to was so disappointed that he could not sit down in from of a television and watch. He still has not got to watch the movie at all and it was one of his all time favorites.
4,DVD compared VHS,Totally agree with reviews re beautiful story and scenery. Truly takes you back in time. Had owned VHS for some time and bought DVD to insure continued viewing. Was disappointed to find that some of the village scenes with fun intermingling were left off the DVD. Just wondered why?
4,Last of the Dogmen,"Have enjoyed the film, as I thought I would. Disappointed this film did not have the narration as in the original version. Why?"
5,don't eat my dog,"I loved this movie. Sort of a ""Dances with Wolves"" format. The Montana scenery is breathtaking. It haughts you. One of the best movies I have ever seen."
4,Why Didn't Anyone Tell Me About This in 1995?,"A true escapist movie, but for those of us who are tired of the violence and greed of today's world, a look at an alternate way of life is uplifting. I found the theme of the movie intriguing: What if it were true? Could it possibly have happened? Wouldn't it be divine justice if it had? And more films should have endings like this one! The music was wonderful, the scenery spectacular, the acting passable by the white actors, and effectively understated by the native Americans. AND - the film was monitored by the American Humane Society, which is especially important to me - no animal should suffer at the hands of mankind for any reason, let alone to create a realistic effect which could be achieved equally well with special effects cameras. This film is an unsung treasure."
2,Last of the Dogmen - DVD,"Didn't realize that Region 2 meant that it will not work in US made DVD Players. Sent it back to the UK, but have not yet received any reply. Learned my lesson. Never Again."
1,Last of the Dogmen,Region 2. Will not play in any of my dvd players. I didn't know it was a region 2. Have to order it again
1,The Last of the Dogmen,This product cannot be viewed on a regular DVD player in the U.S. I didn't read the information on who could play it and who couldn't. So I couldn't watch it. Had I not opened the DVD I could have sent it back. Again I didn't read the information that came with it. So be sure and read the information with any and all DVDs you purchase.
1,Last of the Dogmen,It would of been nice to know that this version would not play in this region on our TV. It will only play in region 2. So now I have a usleess DVD.I did not no anything about different regions. Thanks alot. Very dissapointed
3,to much money,"I feel that i paid to much money for the shape it is in.Having said that,buyer beware.It does play but was used.I will be more careful next time.I paid 34-35.00."
1,Extremely disappointed!,"Sadly, wasted money on DVD that wouldn't play. Did not see ""region 2"" when we ordered. Evidently Region 2 meant it wouldn't play in the USA."
5,Amazing and Safe Treatment for IBS,"My IBS symptoms (mixed) reemerged horribly after having to discontinue a serotonin-based antidepressant due to a rash. I had weeks of incredibly painful symptoms and nothing worked, not even medication from the doctor. I was taking Fibercon caps which did no good. In desperation I tried a low dose of acacia powder and also later, one peppermint capsule a day. A complete turnaround occurred in just a few days, also helped by suggestions on the helpforibs.com website, and I have been doing well ever since. Based on the timeframe,it appears the acacia powder was the most significant agent. I am a complete skeptic so I can tell you this was not a placebo effect. I didn't think it would work and when it did, I was surprised and so grateful."
1,Worsened my IBS,"An IBS sufferer almost my entire life, I found Heather's website the most useful tool ever invented in the management of IBS. Her practical examples and thorough explanations were more productive than all the doctors I've ever consulted put together (and there have been many). Unfortunately, the Acacia Tummy Fiber just did NOT work for me. I followed all the directions given to no avail. Every time I ingested the solution I felt like I was on the verge of an IBS attack with abdominal cramps and spasms. The store I had bought it at promised to give me store credit since I had already opened the package. I called Heather's office (1-206-264-8069) and they agreed to work with the store for a full refund.So even though the product did not work FOR ME, I have a lot of respect for Heather's knowledge and useful experience that she shares with IBS sufferers."
5,Heather's Tummy Fiber Review by Raj Naraparaju,I love this product. I used it as recommended from the day1 and really started to feel the difference within a week. My IBS symptoms reduced considerably. I use it mixing with a couple of spoons of plain yogurt and love the taste also.
2,meh...,"All this product did was give me a temporary peace of mind.. It did nothing to ease my IBS.. Though, perhaps I am a special case. In my honest opinion: pro-biotic supplementation is far superior when it comes to the relief of IBS symptoms. Digestive Advantage: Intensive bowel support, works like a dream.."
5,Love it!,"This is my second day trying it and I am absolutely loving it. I have been suffering for a few years now and decided to take control recently. I have been keeping a food diary, removing certain foods, and increasing water intake. But, I feel the fiber has had that extra push. I finally feel ""clean."" Like some IBS sufferers, I felt ""dirty"" every time I went to bed. When I looked at my tummy in the mirror, I used to cringe! I have been looking like I am 4 months pregnant for 7 years now.Although I am still a work in progress, I feel this was a much needed addition to my diet."
5,Best item for people with IBS,"Bought these after doing some research on fiber for ibs. Of all the things I have tried, this is simply the best for my symptoms. It helps keep me going regularly. Just be careful when you first start to begin with small amounts and work your way up, too much can do more harm than good. Make sure to drink lots of other fluids."
1,acacia senegal,"I have tried all fibers. This fiber is the most expensive and caused me the most pain for my IBS. I cramped up so bad I thought I had the stomach bug so I stopped taking this fiber and it went away. Went back on this fiber and was sick with cramps again. Don't buy this product, see if you can get a sample first before buying it. I bought a large container and now I have to throw it away. The only fiber that works for me is Citrucel. I wish they had unflavored, though. Benefiber does not work either! Hope this helps someone."
3,Heather's Tummy Fiber,"I purchased this product hoping to find a fiber that wouldn't produce so much gas. Unfortunately such was not the case. While I find it does produce less gas than other fibers I have tried, it still is a problem. Two big plusses however are that it only takes about half as much of Heather's Tuffy Fiber to produce the same results as other fibers, and, it does dissolve very quickly, particularly if placed in an empty glass and then filled with warm, (not hot), water. In fact it dissolves so easily that if done in this manner no stirring is necessary. Then, just wait a few minutes until it cools before drinking it."
1,Acacia powder,I tried the acacia powder.......it was the worst thing I have ever done in regards to trying to help my IBS.I felt worse and had to stop.I threw it in the trash.I would not recommend this stuff at all!
3,No rating yet...but price is right,"Sorry for the three-star rating, I couldn't post without stars even though I haven't used this yet. I appreciate all the reviews for this product. You have helped encourage me to try it. Citrucel was recommended to me but has too many calories from sugar, or is loaded with artificial sweeteners/flavorings/colorings. If I take 2 servings of a 60 calorie supplement, I've already consumed 10% of my daily calorie allowance! Not acceptable! Not to mention it is insoluble fiber and I want to use soluble.To answer the one negative review, I calculated the cost per teaspoon of Heather's Tummy fiber versus the Fibersure (using the Amazon price PLUS shipping). The fibersure may look cheaper because it is in smaller containers, but the price per dose is actually better on the Tummy fiber. Tummy Fiber calculated to .11 (USD) per dose, Fibersure calculates to .32 (USD) per dose (rounded to the nearest penny).I will write a real review once I've tried it."
1,didn't work for me,"I had high hopes for this product but it didn't help me, just caused the same painful bloating as all the other fibers I have tried in the past. I won't be using it again."
5,Great Acacia Fiber,"I am very constipated because of IBS, and this fiber works great.I recommend it to anyone suffering from IBS."
5,Instant relief,"I tend to have random IBS attacks. Some days I feel great and can eat salad with no problem, other days I'm lucky if I can get a piece of plain bread down. I've found that the Acacia fiber works the best of all the supplements I've tried, hands down. The peppermint caps exacerbate my symptoms, while the fennel tea only helps sporadically.I usually have a teaspoon in the morning with my juice and another at night. I've also used it during the day whenever I bloat after eating. The bloating and pain disappear almost immediately - after 10-15 minutes I feel like a human being again. I've also incorporated into recipes, as suggested by the [...] website. I keep a pouch of it in my purse at all times and pull it out at restaurants to put into my water. It takes about 3-7 minutes to dissolve completely - after that, you won't even notice it.Thanks to the Acacia fiber, I can eat Greek and Thai food again. I tend to think of it as my ""magic powder""."
5,Great for IBS,"Heather's Tummy Fiber has been the best solution to my IBS. At first it made my tummy more gassy and crampy until my body adjusted. I used this along with reading her book and website articles and found I needed to cut more fatty foods from my diet as well as some other diet and lifestyle changes. Combining the good advice with this product has all but ended years of suffering with IBS. I found it mixes nicely with clear juice or water. With plenty of stirring, it disolves well. I now take 2 t. before every meal and it has changed my life. I even carry some in my purse. I can dine out without running directly to the bathroom after. Highly recommended."
5,Works for me,"I will note initially that my IBS has never been terribly bad; I've mostly ignored it until a recent bad bout (brought on by munching on a jar of chocolate coated almonds) triggered my desire to deal with.That said, a very small measure of this (about a tsp) a day seems to almost completely neutralize both cramps and excessive bathroom-urgency, my two most common symptoms. It has not completely alleviated gas, though I'm belching much less. This is a very individualized complaint, of course, so I can't promise it will work for you as it worked for me. But it worked for me, and I'm pleased."
2,Worked the first two days and then did nothing,"I took this about 7 months ago for several weeks and it worked for the first few days but had no effect thereafter. I was frustrated and tried the unpopular synthetic product Benefiber instead and very much like this product, I gradually increased the dosage. I eventually moved away from Benefiber and I'm still incurring many of the symptoms of IBS. Nevertheless, this didn't work for me. I gave it 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1 out of 5 because it worked for the first few days, so something productive happened."
4,"Fiber is high , but...","I like it and will probably continue to use it , but the prebiotics mentioned on the label which say will help control flatulence, does not for me-- I even bought the fennel tea and peppermint capsules, but still high flatulence level. I also like the product Konsyl, it cost less and slightly less flatulence producing in me."
2,Gave me Bad Gas,"This fiber gave me very bad bloating, gas and more pain. It constipated me even more. Maybe it will work for somebody out there, but not me."
4,Wild Connection Review,"The mellow tunes are wonderful to unwind by. These classy songs are unique, yet they touch the heart with sweet reminiscing lyrics that could just make you melt on one of those bad days that we all get. I recommmend this compilation for those who want something off the beaten path."
5,Awesome,"I was fortunate to see this film while it was on the festival circuit a couple years ago. That I still remember it vividly is a testament to it's quality.Though bleak and somewhat disturbing, it's at the same time very beautiful. The story still haunts me all this time later. Style-wise, it's like watching paintings come to life and move.Anyone with tastes leaning toward the macabre, and that tend to seek out films that shun the typical Hollywood happy gloss should do well to pick this one up.The film may be depressing in subject matter, but you will be happy to have seen such a different take on the apocalyptic-future genre."
1,If Hangeraff is correct then Jesus is counterfeit too,"It is unfortunate that Satan has blinded the eyes of modern day Pharisees. Jesus performed miracles and Pharisees said the same that they Jesus is casting out the demons, healing the sick by the help of devil. Modern day Pharisees also jump in and begin to say seeing any miracle that it is from devil. I see only one difference in Modern day Pharisees from Bible day Pharisees that the Modern Day Pharisees are confessing Christians but deny the power of Christ and Holy Spirit. They think that devil is more powerful than Jesus. This book is all about unbelief."
1,hmmm,"Hank obviously is unhappy with the emotionalism that comes with revival, healing, and signs and wonders. In reality many of the healing miracles done through the healing movement have scientific and medical proof.That doesnt mean that the healers are not sinners just like you and me. It does not mean that the revivalists are not normal people. It just means that God works through real people to make miracles happen. Which sounds alot like the book of Acts. Hank probably wouldnt have been too comfy if he had been at Pentecost."
3,A very good journalistic synopsis of modern revivalism.,"Mr. Hanegraaff writes, in a journalistic/editorial fashion, about many of the false doctrines and questionable spiritual manifestations accompanying modern revivalism. The book is well written, and easy to read and understand. However, anyone expecting a deep theological/academic analysis of this subject will be sorely disappointed. The author could have (and probably should have) provided more authoritative works when attempting to bolster views regarding many of the spiritual manifestations discussed"
3,Was This Written In Love?,"This revealing book was very well written, yet it seemed to bash rather than educate, from my reading of the material. There seemed to be much colour and vivid words added to put irrational emphasis in different areas.I agree that we all should seek out truth, using the Bible as full authority, but after reading the book and listening to Mr. Hannegraaf's radio shows, I must say he needs to learn how to come across more gently and more lovingly in order to not bash and put down our brothers and sisters in Jesus (who may very well be deceived) but to encourage them. We aren't going to save people from ""error"" by coming at them so harshly--it only causes them to turn the speaker/writer off.Steve Hudson, Religion/Psychology Major, Greenville College"
2,"Too dogmatic, where is the faith?","I read this book before and during the process of learning about the Holy Spirt. Though Dr. Hanegraaff is passionate about unmasking the deceptions that some ministers use concerning God, he does so and a negative and often harsh way. Many facts were used in his arguments however his faith never shined through. I often have a hard time siding with someone in the Christian faith who uses head knowledge without incorporating faith into the process. I urge readers to seek out Billy Graham's book Holy Spirit for a better personal insight and experience concerning God as the Holy Spirit. Thank you."
4,Many Christians need to open thier eyes,"Not many professing Christians like this book. Read it and find out why. Highly recommend reading this. Who know, it may open your eyes to the truth."
5,Charismatics can say what they want...this book right on.,"We have too many pseudo Christians proclaiming people ""getting saved"" and really are being caught up in a world of sensation! This book delivers the truth in a powerful and unashamed way. Christians today need to wake up and use discernment to understand the hold that Satan has on the church today."
3,The book is OK,"I would recommend you read Charismatic Chaos. It does a better job of going through the beliefs of many Charismatic, Pentecostal, and Word Faith groups and comparing those beliefs to scripture."
1,A book better not read by anyone who wants to know God,"Hank Hanegraaff is foremost known for his struggle against cults - and he has done a fair, and good job in his exposure. The problem is that he unfortunately doesn't seem to be able to divide between occult cults and Christian brethren. I have myself been into cults - been tried and tested, if I may say so. And I know the tricks of the trade as well as anybody else - in that game. Like Hanegraaff I would like denounce certain things within the charismatic movement - but denouncing all of the charismatic movement is like flushing down the baby with the bathwater. God didn't call us to be lawyers. He called us to be lovers. But when Christian Brothers aren't able to love one another - what happens to the testimony towards the world? I cannot recommend -this- book by Hanegraaff."
1,Good example of how not to do apologetics...,1 Peter 3:15 shows that apologetics should be done with gentleness and respect. Both are missing in this book.
1,Did the Author visit TACF?,"I bought the book after I attended the Catch the Fire Conference in Toronto in October 1998. I approach religious movements with much skepticism. As I read the book I wondered if the author ever actually visited TACF. What I saw and experienced at TACF and what I read in the book were far apart. The proof of any experience is in the fruits of the experience. The Charismatic stream of Christianity like any movement or church has its frauds. However, God is doing a great work in the lives of over a half a billion Charismatic Christians in the world. As a clergyman in an oldline denomination I see more counterfeit Christianity present in it than in the Charismatic stream. TACF is a genuine move of God."
1,Calvary Chapel?,"Doesn't Hank attend Chuck Smith's Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, CA? Calvary Chapel is charismatic. The Vineyard came out of Calvary Chapel. If Hank goes there, and all the anti-charismatics are praising his book, I don't get it. The ""if the root is bad, the fruit is bad"" argument would nail Hannegraaf as ""counterfeit"" as well -- his own pastor had predicted Jesus' return in 1981.Or does Hank fellowship somewhere else? If that is the case, how about an expose on the errors of Chuck Smith & the Calvary Chapel denomination?"
1,"Old Research, Expected Conclusions","This charismatic slam peddles the very sensationalism that it claims to be against. The frauds are obvious and a few extreme examples are ballooned into an event of crisis. This book exists to promote the ""Christian Research Institute,"" a Fundamentalist outfit."
4,The cold hard truth about all the Hype,"Hank really hits home with this one! Being raised on the edge of the Counterfeit Revival, I saw many of the things documented in this book. When they were happening, I insticntively knew something wasn't right -- this book helped me understand what REALLY happened. I recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone even remotely connected to the Charismatic/Faith movement. It will help you separate the true Charisms from the Counterfeit.Only one critique -- Hank holds back on naming some of the biggest names. I know this is from Christian charity and his strong sense of duty to make absolutely sure of guilt, however, clear delineation of ""churches"" and ""leaders"" in this movement is critical to rooting out the problem."
4,Take a listen,"I haven't read the book, but this 2 tape series starts off with some pretty unbelievable snippets of these Revivalists. It does go off into some slightly more obscure studies as the tapes go on (at least compared with some of the more up to date clips Hank has played on his radio show.) If he ever does an update of the tapes, get it - fascinating stuff! Overall, I thought it was worth it."
2,Hannegraff's Anti-charismatic Bias,"I'm not sure what I think of pentacostolism. I honestly don't think that what's going on with Vineyard is spritual, but I do believe in gifts of the Spirit to some extent. I used to listen to Hannegraff regularly, bought his books, etc., accepting his anti-charismatic views as just a differing opinion of a Biblically wise man.Now, however, I can no longer take him seriously. After finding out the COMPLETE story of how Vineyard split off from Hannegraff's own Calvary Chapel, which is never once mentioned in Hannegraff's book, I can no longer listen to him without wondering what kind of spin he's putting on his opinions. Hannegraff is also guilty of not calling out his own Calvary Chapel leaders when they are guilty of some of espousing some of the same beliefs he calls out others on."
1,What's up with disc four?,"Just popped in disc four and I don't see the extras Creating Dynasty or Character Profiles listed in the special features menu. Also, The Testimony episode isn't listed in the episodes menu. Are they actually there? Is anyone else having this problem? Please help!"
3,Alexis Doesn't Show Up Until Season 2,"Season One is more of a straightforward saga of the dysfunctional and wealthy Carrington clan. Things didn't get fun or interesting until the following season when Alexis turned the place upside down. Joan Collins was hell in high heels. (The producers wanted Sophia Loren to play Alexis but that never worked out.)Bring on Season 3, please."
1,"Great series, but I'm STILL waiting for the next seasons.","Last night, I had the pleasure of watching the reunion show ""Dynasty: Catfights and Caviar,"" and it was a wonderful trip down memory lane. It was great to see the clips of seasons past: shoulder pads, catfights, and massive wealth. However, my nostalgia was taken over by MAD FRUSTRATION because I am STILL WAITING for the rest of the ""Dynasty"" seasons to hit DVD. What's taking so long? How much suffering do we have to endure? How much begging do we need to do to make this happen? This is TORTURE, and I'm having a breakdown over this. Sitcoms of much lesser quality are getting rush-released on DVD while a show of this magnitude only has Season One. Sorry, but that's shady. Get it together, people. Get the rest of seasons on DVD. We WANT Joan Collins and we want her NOW!""Dynasty"" gets 5 stars, but the studio gets only ONE."
3,where is season 2?,This season is ok as it shows the start of the Carrington saga but I know that I'll be reiterating what others have said...where is season 2??? I heard that the studio was disappointed with the sales so that's why there is no sign of season 2 but folks when will you realise that Joan Collins only appeared in season 2? Release this please..I'm sure your sales will be much better!!
5,Alexis Morrel Carrington Colby Dexter Raun,"Alexis Morrel Carrington Colby Raun...hey, you left out Dexter! :)I bought this when it first came out and I am enjoying revisiting the Carrington clan. What great fun."
4,it was a Cool Show early on,Before all the crazyness took over Dynasty was a Interesting show. there were some interesting storylines&whatnot going down with this show.I use to watch this show back in the day before it got to campy for it's own good but to truly appreciate it then you will more than likely dig the time period between 81-86 that was it's Prime&Peak.Dynasty should have done like Dallas&added a two for One Season because Dynasty didn't age well after time.
3,"Dynasty, season 1",I was sorely dissapointed that you did not offer a disclaimer regarding the fact that Joan Collins does not appear on any segment.
3,Wally World did it again........,I saw it on the shelf and it was 19.99......... sometime the better values are at actual brick and mortar stores!!!!! Sorry Amazon.....love ya but have to shop around.
1,WORST PACKAGED SET EVER!,I RECEIVED 2 DISCS OF THE SAME .. SET DID NOT HAVE DISC ONE!!!!!!!! Waited for this for a long time to be REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!
3,Better to look at than to use,"I was slightly disappointed, these did not cut chicken breast easily. They worked better on beef but meats need to be under 1/2 inch thick for best results. However, the quality and weight are excellent."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Design","This item looked good in the design, but it is heavy and the fork tines are very blunt with very little taper. This makes them harder than necessary to push into food and the square-cut tines feel sharp to your tongue."
4,Not what I expected,They don't cut as well as you are lead to believe. I'd say not much better than a normal fork even. But they are very nice and heavy and look good.
2,disappointing,"After the exelent ""Dirt"" expectations were all time high. However I was very disappointed. The songs sound very alike and around the 6. track I lost patience. AIC does not sound inspired at all. I hope this album will not be their swan song."
3,Last Call,"The last studio record from AIC is mostly about what could have been. You can almost hear a band unsure of their direction and its singer's(Layne Stayley)inablity to come to terms with his heroin addiction. Stayley's menacing vocals are sorely missed in the plodding ""Grind"" as Jerry Cantrell's smooth voice fails to fit with the overall grim mood. Elsewhere, Cantrell has far more success singing on the acoustic ""Heaven Beside You"" and ""Over Now""(which perfectly encapsulates the band's struggle to survive). The Stayley composition ""Head Creeps"" might as well be called ""Angry Chair 2,"" but sounds hamfisted and unrehearsed. That feeling spills out to most of the record, nowhere more apparent than on the noodling jam that closes the otherwise gruesome addiction tale ""Sludge Factory."" This band was on its last legs and more than likely knew it. If anything this CD is good snapshot of those last moments."
4,Didn't get it's chance,"This cd is really underated. It starts of real strong weakens a bit in the middle but always hold on to the great Aic sound. Not as good as a ""Dirt"" but what is?"
4,"Liars, theives, the conspiracy! Your weapon is guilt!!!","And your greatest pains are regrets that represent calamities!I remember Layne Staley for his philosophical thoughts, not his drug abuse!Only a very few people can realize that their weapons are guilts, because only a very few people understand the greatest ways of being honest. And believe or not, I happen to be one of them very honest bones...We're all born into the Grave!!!"
4,Unique,"This album has a lot alot of good stuff in it. Every song is unique unlike most albums where the band finds one or two things that work well and use it over and over. They never toured on this album so it never got much notoriety. If you liked any of their other albums, you'll surely like this one."
3,"Good, but ""Dirt"" is better","One gets the impression that this album was recorded under strained conditions such as the Beatles self-titled double album known as the ""White Album"". Is it just coincidence that both are self-titled? Anyway, AIC seems to be breaking new ground, call it ""progressive grunge""? Personally, I like ""Dirt"" better, you might say it is more mainstream, whereas ""Alice in Chains"" is more avant-garde. In short, I like this album, but ""Dirt"" blew me away..."
3,Classic Sound,"This CD is great, as it does still have the classic Alice in Chains sound, but it really isn't one of their best."
5,How could this be anything less than 5 stars,"This album is the work of genious's in Layne Staley, Jerry Cantrell and Co. Every song has the bit between the teeth. The album has everything desired in a classic rock album. A mix of climaxes in the form of 'Again' that keeps you listening time after time, the blend of mellow rock within 'Heaven Beside You' and 'Over Now' and the deep and powerful droning of tracks such as 'Sludge Factory'. Layne Staley's voice penetrates throughout the album, brilliantly bending notes and screeching that marks all of his work. Only a tragic death has prevented Staley and Alice in Chains in general in moving onto bigger things. Your Rock collection is lonely without this album. The Self titled 'Alice in Chains' Dwarfs other albums in quality even ones such as 'The Best Of' and 'Facelift' (also works of Art), and matches, if not betters, dare i say it, 'Dirt'. A 'MUST BUY' especially for Alice in Chains fans."
5,Great work,Though the band was troubled with multiple problems at the time I think it is still one of their best albums. It shows great diversity and is a great pogression for the band. Unique and just as good as dirt if you open your mind.
4,WE'LL MISS YOU LAYNE STALEY,This is a great cd for any hard rock fan's collection. It has a lot of great songs in which some are dark and solomn and others are just good.I cant believe the lead singer is dead but I will mis Layne Staley forever
5,"Even for 1 or 2 new tracks, it's still worth it.","The only differences between this and the original is that the front is white without the dog and there are two remixes of ""Again"". The first remix ,""Tattoo of Pain Mix"", is already available in the AiC boxset but the only unreleased track here is the Jungle remix. But for that track, it's worth it. The only downside to this for anyone, is the pricing, which is at $42.99. Yea...if you want it, you gotta pay it."
4,"Not their best, but still kicks ass!","I am not the first one to say this, but this isn't their best album. However, with songs like ""Grind"", ""Heaven Beside You"", and ""So Close"" (along with all of the others), this is one album that can be listened to over and over again. Most of the music was written by Cantrell, but that just makes the songs as good as they are. Staley's lyrics are dark and creepy, but they go good with the music. The only thing I don't like about this album is the artwork...what the hell is some of that crap?!Anyway, a solid 4-star album that is great for any AIC fan.Best songs: Grind, Heaven Beside You, Again, So Close, and Frogs.By the way, if anyone knows what Staley is saying at the end of ""Sludge Factory"" and ""Frogs"", please notify me."
4,Alice in Chains mellowed to much,"Their first Album rocked it out, this one I couldn't really get into. There was a couple of songs I liked. As for the seller, CD came promptly and in good condition."
5,THE GREATEST CD EVER RELEASED!,"This CD is amazing! One that has not left my CD player since the day I bought it, it sits beside every other AIC CD I own. Every song is amazing, I listen to this CD at least twice daily. Every AIC fan should have this CD, Every music fan should have this CD. If you like amazing music then go buy this now, don't wait, this is the greatest CD ever realeased."
3,Ok- could be better,The late 90's continue to let me down as another one of my favorites puts out some garbage.
3,Uninspired ?,"I love Alice In Chains...and it's not that I think this is a bad album, but I picture Layne wrapped up in a shall and sitting in a wheelchair while recording his vocal tracks! The singing has none of the power or lunacy that was displayed in Dirt or Facelift.I don't think Layne was into this when they made the album or maybe it was his health, I don't know, but I would love to see a new album with Layne singing like we know he can! Thanks for readingTroy"
5,correction,Just a correction. Bruce Davidson made these photographs using a 4x5 camera. Not 8x10. Met the photographer tonight and that is what he said.
5,Nice go-to hoops,"I've always kept a good pair of hoops at the ready. Its a nice standard to have in your wardrobe.I bought these to replace my old set. They look great, but they are a bit thinner and softer than my old pair. They warp if you tug them out too quickly, and have to be reshaped. Still, they always look fabulous."
1,Ridiculous!,"These earrings were so flimsy it was hard to insert into itsy-bitsy opening on the other side while it's in the ear! OMG! By the time I got it inserted the earring looked like a crazy ""S"" !!!!!!!!!!! They need to thicken these also. It doesn't take much to bend and break. Waste of money."
1,waisting money..,"i hate this earring,becouse the the size is not big enough, and after fer weeks the color change!!!!this is not a real sterling silver so if you dont wanna waste your money dont buy this earring its trash!!!"
4,Good wooden game,"This is a nice little wooden game. I think kids will like to play it as well as play ""with"" it. Everything fits inside a wooden box and a bag is included to carry the box. You can't go wrong with purchasing quality wooden toys and games. A good deal for the money."
5,Nostalgia at its best!,"Graduating in 1967, I grew up enjoying Spanky and Our Gang. In my opinion, they can't do wrong. And you can't go wrong listening to this terrific band at their best. They're songs are timeless, and, for me,one of the greatest sounds to come out of their era."
4,interesting book,"It is one of the nicest surprises in terms of Botticelli scholarship. The author (an illustrious Leonardo scholar) is trying to interpret a number of paintings on which there is already quite a lot of bibliography, and does a pretty good job. My only complaint is the fact that sometimes I wish he would deepen and extend his very interesting comments (the book has 128 pages and 72 illustrations, usually taking up the space of a page, so there is not a whole lot of text, and the fonts are pretty big). So, if you are looking for interesting theories concerning Botticelli's mythological paintings, than this is one of the books for you. If you're looking for books with nice pictures, there are better ones available (this one is smallish, and because of the format, although has nice details, the main pictures do not generally fit on a single page)."
2,misleading,"this only includes the large size, not the other two sizes shown.It is expensive for only 1 tool"
1,The Knork just does not work like expected,"I purchased a set of four Knorks at my moms request, she read about them and felt the Knork would be ideal because of the arthritis she has in her hands, she is also 92 and can use a knife and fork extremely well considering her arthritis.She needed something that would make eating an easier task. Well for one thing they are quite heavy and hard for her to handle, another thing is following the directions by pressing down on what you want to cut and wiggling the Knork she can't cut anything except some pasta, mashed potatoes, and some soft cake. The Knork looked good,sounded good and it had some good reviews . No good for mom though....they are now in the bottom of her junk draw.They came across as top shelf stuff with their AAA GAME but in actuality for mom they are a big flop....caseyAugust 19,2011...Friday"
4,Always a happy ending for Lori Wick,"As usual Lori Wick gives us the happy ending we were all waiting for. There are a lot of characters and that keeps everything interesting, although at first it's hard to keep up with everyone. It's nice if you like keeping up with everyone from the past books. If you like continued stories, you'll like these books."
5,The Visitor,Lori Wick is one of my favorite Christian writers. Her books are written with careful attention to detail and with great sensitivity and depth.
3,Big Snooze,"I loved the first two books in the English Garden series, but this one was really boring. I couldn't keep track of how all the friends, neighbors and family were inter-related and kept getting confused by all the different characters. Hardly anything happened in the story other than women picking flowers, getting marriage proposals or becoming pregnant. I guess that's how a typical Jane Austen-type novel reads, but I had a hard time getting through the book. I much prefer Jan Karon's Mitford series."
3,Blind Love....,"A tale of two sisters: one who falls in love with a blind man and one whose romantic interest is blind to her love. The story begins with the first sister reading daily to the man who, on his doctor's advice, has sought a quiet retreat, hoping the rest will help regain his sight. The second sister's heart throb is in Africa with a her brother. Another brother, at home with the sisters, is blind to how his shyness affects those around him. Once aware of the consequences of his shyness, he turns to God for help. Interwoven subplots reinforce the theme of God's love.This book is written in a style that fits the historical scenario (1812 in the English countryside), but is not as interesting to me as some others by Lori Wick. My favorites by Lori Wick include The Princess, Song for Silas, and Sophie's Heart."
2,What happened to Lori Wick,"I used to be such a huge Lori Wick fan but it seems like all her newer books, basicly anything after the Texas Rose Trilogy have just been trite books with no depth. Ok I will admit that the frist time that I read the Vistor I really like it. I thought that it was a fun quick read. But I just reread it and I just wanted to throw the book across the room everytime Cassie went off on her looks or lack there of in her opinion. At 24 years of age as Cassie is in the book you should realize that there is more to life then looks. And I just can't see that any guy would put up with girl so insecure about her looks as Cassie is and to pull what Cassie does in the book. But I guess in the world of Lori Wick if you are red head with freckles you have to get a guy to fall in love with you before he sees you to have any chance at happiness."
3,"Not her best, but entertaining","I found the book relaxing and entertaining, but not evoking the deep feelings or profound truth of some of her earlier works. Still worth reading, for Lori Wick fans."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This book has to be somebody's cruel way of playing a practical joke. The writing was horrible! My friend's eight year old could've written better. Talk about confusing???? This story bounced all over the place. There was no real connection. What in tarnation was she screaming about? I read on the back of the book that the author is an editor and attended writing classes. That remains to be seen. If I were her, I wouldn't tell anyone and would take that off the back of the book. I was so turned off by the writing and story itself (being so poorly written) that on several occasions I had to put the book down. I only picked it back up to give it a chance, but it was so hard and unfortunately, a first occurred for me: I could not finish this book. Don't mean to be cruel, but unlike most authors, this writer does not display any inkling of being ""gifted"" in any writing manner."
2,Not as good as everyone else seems to think.,"I did not think that The Jasmine Trade was very good, especially when compared to other new thrillers, like The Stone Monkey, by Jeffery Deaver. I found the main character Eve Diamond's self-conscious narration tedious, and the confidence she inspired in those she interviewed hightly unlikely. If I were a ""parachute kid"" who she tried to interview, I would kick her out on her [rear]. Diamond was stupid, allowing herself to be conned, drugged, and robbed at various times in the book, and the story's twists were forseeable. The thing the book had going for it was, dispite its lack of style, it had two intriguingly realistic news expose' storylines going at once, about ""parachute kids"" and Asian brothels. Unfortunatly, the ending was exceedingly disapointing."
2,Don't buy it.....,"The writing is good, the background is interesting but the main character is an ass. She manages to get almost everyone (and a animal) she comes in contact with beat up, murdered or left as a prostitute, because she can't seem to keep her mouth shut. I hate that. Nothing is resolved and she goes on her merry way without a clue its all her fault. I'll take a pass on the next one."
1,tired,"This is not a good book-it is not even average. The female protagonist is a trite, tired stereotype and the plot does not hold together logically. I can suspend belief, but not logic. All the characters are stereotypes and the whole mess is just not good. I do not understand where all the five star reviews came from unless they are all friends of Ms. Hamilton's."
4,great album,A great mix of different Jamaican styles...from roots to dancehall...it's a great reggae album with a Christ centered message
4,A useful guide,"Holladay begins by presenting the 10 major problems that Christians have with the Old Testament, and then rather than pretend that they can be easily handled or dismissed, he simply acknolwedges them and moves on to his exposition. I found this to be very honest and frankly comforting. The author does offer some solid advice on ways to deal with difficult Old Testament passages, but he never says ""grit your teeth and believe it"".His approach reveals a scholarly background, but this book is accessible to the layman. If you are dedicated to the inerrancy and/or verbal inspiration of the Bible, be warned -- he isn't. But he does take the Bible seriously as the record of the history of God's dealings with people.My biggest complaint is that he constantly uses phrases like ""Jesus is remembered as having said..."" or ""Jeremiah understood God to be telling him...."" Whatever the academic merits of such phrases may be, they are stylistic death."
5,Old Testament for Today's World,READING THIS BOOK FOR A BOOK CLUB AT MY CHURCH (PROGRESSIVE METHODISTS). IT'S EXTREMELY THOUGHT PROVOKING - BRINGING ANCIENT HEBREW HISTORY INTO THIS CENTURY AND MAKING IT RELEVANT TO TODAY'S SOCIETY AND POLITICS. GOD DID NOT STOP SPEAKING WHEN THE CHURCH CLOSED THE CANON IN 300 AD!
4,All of Flashman's adventures with American Indians.,"This is one of the better books by Fraser on Flashman's participation in American History. Flashman is involved with the Plains Indians and the Apaches, both before and after the American Civil War."
5,Repeat review,"Flash Harry follows his usual routine ignoring the call of duty and the course of honor while advancing his own agenda and running into several worthy adversaries (Wild Bill Hickok ( a killing gentleman ), Geronimo, Crazy Horse, Georgie Custer, Kit Carson but repeatedly avoiding his just desserts and surviving (after a fashion)to garner fresh kudos through judicious silence, blustering, frank lies and misdirection, and considerable cowardice. American history will never be the same."
5,It's difficult to do serious reviews on Flashman,He's good history submerged in laughter. By now you are hooked. Buy it. You can't fight it.
1,ETHNIC SLUR,"THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK IS AN ETHNIC SLUR, I.E. 'REDSKINS'. WOULD YOU SAY BLACKSKINS? OR YELLOWSKINS? I WOULDN'T READ A BOOK WITH A TITLE LIKE THAT."
1,Bottom Feeding with Vortis,"It really is too bad that Amazon doesn't have a zero-star grade.When I was a student at DePaul University, one of my professors,who is a friend of DeRogatis, approached me to help with artworkfor the band. It took about 10 seconds of listening to decidethat I never wanted to have anything to do with Vortis.-1,000,000 points for sucking so bad"
4,Sit back and relax,"This band is amazing. They are calm, but at the same time they invoke different emotions. The song ""Our Hero Shot"" is amazing, especially because they use a marching band, which is very different. And the song ""Cue the Sun"" is very emotional! The singers voice is calming, but slightly emo at the same time. Very good cd for those who like indie/emo."
2,No so impressed,"I'd seen some good reviews for this album so I bought it but I found it tedious, predictable and unoriginal. No bombast, no standouts, nothing to write home about - completely trapped in a genre."
3,What do I know about hard rock?,"Oh, my God! It's the second ECW CD! Unfortunately, it came out after ECW had gone out of business. So, none of the songs on here were actually heard in ECW. But, at least the songs are introduced by ECW stars. As for the music, it is mostly alternative hard rock. Not really my cup of tea, but the cover version of ""Natural Born Killaz"" is pretty cool. Here is the track listing:1. Intro by Joey Styles2. ""Balls to the Wall"" by Chimaira3. ""Head"" by Static-X4. ""El Cu Cuy"" by Coal Chamber5. ""Superbeast"" by Rob Zombie6. ""One Step Closer"" by Linkin Park7. ""Neckbone"" by Powerman 50008. ""Just Got Wicked"" by Cold9. ""Now You Want Me"" by U.P.O.10. ""Welcome Burden"" by Disturbed11. ""Holy Man"" by One Minute Silence12. ""Highway to Hell"" by Jesse James Dupree13. ""Natural Born Killaz"" by F.M. Racket"
5,A delightful learning experience,"This software delivers great bang for the buck. My son is almost three and he loves this program, which is designed to help children learn the alphabet. He calls it Juice Caboose. It has numerous characters that are fun and the music is charming. The exercises are challenging, but not impossible.I believe that interactive learning software is a much better way for children to spend time than watching TV or videos. This is a good program because it holds the child's attention and creates a fun learning experience. I recommend it highly."
4,Great for learning ABC's!,"My 3 1/2 year old loves this software. It has helped him learn abc's, upper/lower case, matching, finding, letter sounds, etc. I was very happy with this. The only disappointment was that after he'd mastered the 3 different activities, there wasn't another level with new activities. Still fun, though!"
3,Very Average,"The music was nice, but the dialogue was too long.... My three and 1/2 year old became easily bored. He was only interested in the sled game. Its good for kids who can keep focused on something for a long time."
5,Awesome,Good book lots of intrigue and war. Felt almost like I was in the battles. Looking forward eagerly to the next book.
2,Scheduling function not exactly foolproof.,"Scheduling function not exactly foolproof.I've experienced a variety of small issues using Net Nanny thus far (inability to use Norton Antivirus auto-updates, Win98 auto-updates, Outlook express issues, etc.) but I have to say the worst is the scheduling function.We purchased NetNanny in part because of it's claimed ability to regulate access times to the internet via a scheduling function. This function allows you to set a schedule of time specific users can have access to the internet. The function works great. However we quickly noticed that simply changing the PC's time (via the clock on the taskbar) will bypass this feature. This renders this feature useless. I don't know of a child over the age of 8 that doesn't know how to change the PC's time."
3,good,Does not allow hibernation in windows ME my computer stays on all the time and I have to manually place it into hibernation. Otherwise than that it works as advertised
3,Wonderfully Horrible Book,"My son received this book when he was 4. He is 8 and I still read it to him. This book will be one I keep but only because it is so horrible. The first time I read it, I was so shocked with how horrible it was I started making fun of it. My son that it was so funny, he still wants me to read it. The main character is a professor named Sponge. His dog is Soap. He has two children with him. He decides to spend the night in a dark cold cave, because that is the best place to sleep... right? The picture shows two frightened kids with a sleeping adult. Later in the book, the professor exclaimed ""It's hopeless. There is no escape!"" and the dog rescues them. They discover that there is a T-Rex ghost who is trapped and they can give back a bone they found to save it. This book is so bad, it will be kept in our family for a very long time."
5,Wonderful,"My parents got this book for me for my 6th birthday. I adored it & always had to have it with me. I don't remember specifics about the story this many years later, but it wasn't SCARY to me at that age, despite advertised ""spooky"" holograms. All the illustrations were wonderful & I was always mesmerized by the holograms.When the hubby & I found out we were having a baby, this was one of the first on my ""Need to Have"" books list. Unfortunately, my sister had already claimed all of our childhood books when she was expecting her own baby, including this one. Since I'm a good auntie, there's no way I could possibly steal it away from my little niece. We were very excited to find it here since it wasn't one of those huge titles that every kid had. Can't wait to share it with my niece & son when they get a bit older."
1,total disappointment,This book is pretentious and self-consciously arty - I didn't find it useful or even easy to read. And I also object to having 2 pornographic pictures in it. It is the only book I have ever returned because of content in my life!
3,Five Shaolin Masters,"This movie has a classic story line, with what i thought had a predictable ending. This is a good Sunday afternoon movie or rainy day flick."
2,Five Shaolin Punks,This one is a lot better than those that I currently ordered from here; It's about 5 shaolin brothers where their temple was burned down by the ching army and they were the only ones who survived but there is a traitor who ratted them out. This actually a sequel and you really don't have to see the first one to understand this one.
1,Five Shaolin Punks,"This is an absolute embarrassment to kung-fu. The intro is stupid, the fighting styles are fake and sloppy and the cover of the dvd is just pure trash. No wonder I got this dvd quickly, they knew it was crap. You won't rip me off again."
1,Sorry,"This looks like a remake of a old movie. It was sorry and it cost more than the others that I paid. I wish I had know, no story line either. No reflection on Amazon.com, still my favorite."
1,OVERRATED BIG TIME!! I MEAN BIG TIME!,"this movie SUCKED and im a huge kung fu film fan... this movie is packed with stars and sucks miserably... no lie, this movie was slow paced, and the choreography was the worst ive ever seen... this movie was a bigger let down than seeing a girl with a nice rack but once you get her bra off they sag to her belly... uggh,huge disappointment.. i took my movie to the pawn shop and got 2 bucks for it and it wasnt even worth that.. i have no idea why this movie is so highly rated.. i was forced to put one star but if i could put negative stars i would"
2,Too much cheap acting and drama.,The actions flicks shows Kung Fu boxing styles which are old and hard to find a master to teach where I live. Made me fall asleep.
2,Breast pads,I did not like these. They aren't very big and they are pre-formed in a rounded shape. They are also really thick. I prefer a different brand.
2,Great product when arrives intact...,"Love the product, but was quite unimpressed when it arrived in a shipping envelope all beat up with the pads full of packing lint!"
3,The shape is embarassing,"The contour is great, and the absorbency is fine, but my complaint is the nipple shape, which you can see through your shirt. I try to not have visibly protruding nipples, which I didn't have, so Johnson's provided them for me."
1,"Terrible, Defective. Do NOT Buy!","Bought one of these because the cord on my apple adaptor broke. Thought this looked more sturdy. Boy was I wrong. After only 6 weeks the adaptor started hissing while plugged in, stopped powering my notebook, got dangerously hot, and the blue LED starting blinking on and off. Since I use this while traveling I had no backup and had to go out and immediately buy an (apple) replacement. Contacted their customer support but have yet to hear back. I am totally fed up with this product and this company. DO NOT BUY THIS ADAPTOR."
2,Rings don't close well,"I'm using my binder for attorney paperwork and place my papers inside of plastic sleeves before putting them in the binder. One of the rings doesn't close well enough so every time I flip through the papers/sleeves, it either gets caught or the sleeves fall out. I'm not happy with the binder and will not buy this brand again. I didn't even buy mine on Amazon ... I bought mine at Office Depot. I noticed that another ""reviewer"" has the same problem with his binder rings as I do mine. I would not recommend."
5,Johnny Reid ROCKS!,Johnny Reid is a exciting performer to watch!! He also has helped out with public television fund raising. I enjoy his music and he also has great charisma.
2,Take a pass on this one,"The 22 Super Cities travel videos, of which this is one, all appear to follow the same general format-30 minutes of low-level aerial views alternating with ground-level shots of various sights and local people, all to convey a sense of the ambience of the city. That approach works well where, as with Vienna and St. Petersburg, the city offers a finite number of attractions, many of which are outdoors.It does not, however, work with London. There is simply so much to do and see there that it cannot be covered quickly. Experienced travelers know this, and will limit themselves to a few attractions on each visit.If possible, try to find a video or a book that focuses on the particular aspects of the city that interest you. For those interested in walking tours, ""LononWalks"" (out-of-print but available from used book dealers) is a good choice."
5,BOCK'S BEST!,"A gem of a show that was lost in the shadows of ""Hello Dolly"" and ""Funny Girl."" For my money, this exemplifies Bock and Harnick's versatility in writing Broadway shows. Even tops ""Fiddler"" and ""Tenderloin,"" which I didn't think could be topped. Brilliant cast! Brilliant recording! A must for musical theatre lovers. She Loves Me... and I LOVE her!"
3,Great soundtrack but I have heard a better one!,I love this version of She Loves Me- But there is one version that I prefer--- the made for TV BBC version in the 60's starring Gemma Craven and Robin Ellis-- their soundtrack is magic-and British! I still can't get my hands on either the soundtrack or the VHS version..but I will never forget it!
4,Great... with reservations.,"I think She Loves Me might be my all-time favorite ""classical"" Musical. I love the story, romance, humor and most of all, the music. Having said that, I think the 1993 Broadway revival (at least the album, since I never saw the original Musical itself) improved on the original and is possibly one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. This album is also EXCELLENT, just not quite as..."
1,Nike Blade Watch - Not Designed to last,I have owned this Nike Blade watch model WC0037 for 7 months. It is a very neat watch. Unfortunately it broke and I don't know how. One evening I remove it from my wrist and notice the black bubber wrist band had separated from the body at the rear battery cover. The entire rubber/plastic hinge had cracked. This wrist band is not replaceable. I wore this watch daily to my office job. A sports watch should be made rugged. This one is not. Lesson learned is to buy a watch which has a standard replacable wrist band.
5,"live & loud ? No, it's a lot more than that","20 tracks of ozzy's greatest hits (i still play the DVD version all the time)Anyway as usual eevrything is perfect: classic vocals powerfull guitar fine bass are taken for granted .The fact that moved me oof my seat was the drumming. I don't know who is responsible for the, at least rematkable, drum sound . is it the mixing? I don't know but in quality it surpasses most of the resent live albums"
5,Ozzy At His Best!,"No matter how old he is, this proves that Ozzy is the true Godfather of Metal. The accompanying dvd is just as good."
5,INCREDIBLE LIVE DOUBLE ALBUM !,"""Live and loud"" it's one of my favorites albums, because the album contains all the power of Ozzy's music. The drums are thunderous, Zack plays like Randy Rhoads, the bass sounds incredible and Ozzy's voice sound powerfull. ""Mr. Crowley"" sounds noizy, specially the keyboards, ""Miracle man"" it's loudest song in the album, and of course, all the classic tracks of Mr. Osbourne sounds great: ""Crazy train"", ""I don't know"",""Flying high again"", ""Bark at the moon"", ""Suicide solution"", ""Paranoid"", ""Goodbye to romance"" and ""I don't want to change the wold"". If you like the good heavy metal concerts, buy it now."
2,Don't bother,"I felt the other reviewer was absolutely correct in his/her assessment of this book. I, too, noticed the inaccuracies (the author also has Prince Albert's mother divorcing his father--highly unlikely in the atmosphere of the time) and his use of the English language was faulty. It was difficult at times to figure out to whom he was referring in his use of pronouns, and some words he used in a way that was neither correct nor standard usage.The author had a disconcerting habit of making jumps in the timeline (he marries and buries Edward VII and then goes on to describe his life and eating habits.) Rather confusing!Two stars is actually being rather generous. There are better sources out there."
4,Preaching To The Choir,"Ok, I love almost all kinds of music from classical, jazz, rap, world, etc.I found this CD as I sorted through my collection, I stuck it into the CD rack in my car trunk. When I played it, I thought 'who is this ?'My response; 'damn this is really good music'; such a freshing, creative and passionate style versus the generic, regurgitated styles that we hear everyday.So, enjoy this amazing melange of vocals and instrumental jazz or accept the equivalent of junk-food pushed by the media."
3,Not the best of P.D.James,"Usually love P.D James, but not this time. This was not a great story and not as much fun to read as many previous books. I am hoping the next one improves."
5,PD James Books,"I just started reading books by PD James and have been intrigued with Adam Dalgliesh Mysteries. I have read this one, Private Patient, and reading Cover Her Face. I've bought a few others on Amazon and anxious to read them."
3,The print is too small!,"When I opened the book I got a very unpleasant surprise - this is the smallest print I have ever seen in any book! I purchased this title to read for airplane travel and know it will be even harder to read under the often poor lighting conditions.I know books come in LARGE print, it should be stated that this book is in SMALL print!A Taste for Death (Adam Dalgliesh Mysteries, No. 7)"
3,"AD gets a ""C""","It was my least favorite Adam Dalgliesh story so far, but I am a big fan. It seemed to slog through some digressions and had a shaky construct, but was a good time."
2,Not James at her best by any means,"This marked a low point in James's mysteries: her obsession with Victorian architecture seems of much greater interest to her than the characters (Sir Paul not only lives in a Soane mansion but he is murdered in an architecturally significant church), and the suspects are all so universally loathsome you wind up not caring who did it in the end. James seems even to take special relish in Lady Ursula's hateful snobbishness and misanthropy. A bad place to start with the Adam Dagliesh novels, when there are so many finer earlier ones (DEATH OF AN EXPERT WITNESS) and even later ones (A CERTAIN JUSTICE)."
4,A Taste For Great Detail,"This is another in the Adam Dalgliesh series by Ms. James in the United Kingdom. An elderly woman & a young boy stumble across a double murder in a small Vestry of a church. One, an important person Dalgliesh knows; the other a tramp.Ms. James is an excellent author when sticking to details & descriptions. She develops characters well. She doesn't need to get into a lot of gore & violence in her descriptions. The reader can clearly see it through her writing.The book is very well done. I found the tramp's murder somewhat passe. I was a bit bothered and felt the book leaned toward social classes since almost nothing was mentioned of the tramp's untimely demise. If this was the premise, why include his character at all?"
4,A very intelligent mystery,"This is a terrific book. The first 100 pages are a bit slow, but then you get into the book, and it's really good. Very English, not that exciting but very... interesting (I can't really find the right word...I'm from Sweden). There's not much action, but who needs action when you have PD James' English ways, dry humor, and the great Adam Dalgliesh?"
3,Quite an interesting collection of essays,I found many of these essays quite interesting of various standards. Particularly Michael Doran essay on whether we are getting involved in someone's civil war.
2,Sandy Berger fiddled while New York (nearly) burned,"How is it that former deputy security advisor Sandy Berger rates as an authority on how 9/11 happened? Dick Morris, Clinton's political advisor during Berger's tenure in the White House, singles out Berger for particular scorn in a recent Wall Street Journal essay, claiming that Berger ""seemed to work overtime at opposing tough measures against terror.""Put another way, asking Sandy Berger to explain how 9/11 happened is like asking Neville Chamberlain to explain the origins of Nazi aggression."
5,Timeless classic,"I've just put this into my CD player again after not having listened to it for a couple of months and it still sounds as fresh as ever! Brilliant production, uplifting and catchy tunes and beautiful vocals. If these songs don't cheer you up, nothing probably will! I've never heard of them again after this release, got no clue why. This CD will remain one of my favorites!"
4,The lost love child of Sade and the Friends of Distinction,"Oddly, I'm just discovering this CD, and at first spin, the sound strikes me as an updated Friends of Distinction -- y'know, that smooth pop group from the early '70's whose hits ""Grazin' in the Grass"" and ""Love or Let Me Be Lonely"" still rightfully ride the oldies-but-goodies waves -- coupled with hints of the more recent sultry jazziness of Sade. Sure, the lyrics on this disc are not exactly memorable, but with this effervescent, upbeat, mostly easy-on-the-ears, melodic groove, what's not to like? I'm ridin' with it just fine..."
1,It's better to travel - far AWAY from this CD!!!,"You might think that after a listen or two, the songs here are extrememly catchy. However, after that you quickly find yourself becoming extremely nauseaous from just listening to these over-produced tunes. You will soon want to quickly exorcise this CD from your CD collection AND your collective memory! That said, I still highly recommend Kaleidoscope World where the songs (save only a few) represent superb pop-craft that hold up to repeated listenings!"
5,Fooled By a Hit !,"Most people only remember Swing Out Sister's pop hit ""Breakout"" from this album. Audiences who embraced that single were not ready for the smooth sophisticated sounds which truely defines Swing Out Sister. Their successful blend of jazz, r&b, and pop makes this CD a classic. Corrine's uniqe vocals are refreshing, and adds an extra sparkle to this gem. This group ranks up there along with the timeless sounds of Sade, and Basia."
1,Not as good as SAP's online help,"The content in this book is not helpful if you know how to use SAP's online help. It is insufficient to provide an understanding of how particular functions in PP module work. In brief, this book is not informative."
2,"Knowledgeable, but inaccessible","I have had a fair amount of experience reading complicated literature, and enjoy following a clear, tightly reasoned argument, but this book is just too hard to follow. The author has not managed to provide an accessible account Man's prehistory. He gives us a degree of detail more appropriate for a scientific treatise. He has a fascinating story to tell, and I hope that he will eventually provide a more readable book."
4,Review of Essential Managers Guide,"Excellent addition to any managers ref. library. Pros: A wealth of information, well written, the layout flows, and plenty of graphics to keep the reader interested. Cons: Target reader seems to be the those with limited experience, touches only lightly on some very important skills that could use more in-depth discussion. Overall: Well worth the price...."
5,Quick Reference!,The manual is trying to cover all the essential areas of management. It is an ideal reference book for those who wants to have a peep into the management field. For those who are in the advanced stage of management this book may serve to refresh the basics.It is a good book for the entry level personnel in the management field.
1,Essential Manager's Manual,Not at all what I thought it was going to be. Way too intoductory and simplistic for a manager who is actually managing anything or anybody. Not something I would want anyone to see on my office bookshelf.
1,only for the extremely inexperienced,"This book tries to explain each aspect of management in one or two pages. Quite a challenge and not surprisingly this book does not succeed.The information given will be so obvious for most that reading this book is a waste of time. As a reference this book will not be of much use either, since no subject is covered in any depth.The tone and language leave much to be desired. True, the lack of jargon must be applauded, but this book has nothing of substance to replace it with. Some of the advice is simply laughable, such as: - ""Don't keep sweets in the house"" - ""Do not be belligerent, it is counterproductive"" - ""Do not make major decisions too quickly"".This book tries to achieve too much in too little space."
3,Essential Managers Manual,It's a great book for an office person or a beginner that need to get some skills a bit sharpened it's not what i have seen in a real life but it has some good theories for a person that hasn't had a university degree in a supervision or management
4,Tricks how to become a successful manager,This book is not for reading from the beggining to the end. But to pick up necessary chapter for your everyday's challenges at work/conferences etc. This book helped me to control my emotions during the speech deliverance and in time managing. I'm sure every person will find something new and necessary for everyday use.Enjoy reading and greets from Ukraine.
2,Too basic for practical use,"This book tries to cover too many topics. It isn't detailed enough to even be a good reference. The only use I could see is for someone who wants a quick overview of one of the topics. If you have the slightest clue about what you're doing, spend your money more wisely on a book devoted to the topic."
4,A tearjerker,"Gregg Allman was still developing his promising songwriting talent at this stage, but the highlights are a great remake of his very own classic, 'Midnight Rider', and a sublime reading of Jackson Browne's 'These Days', sad as can be (the pedal steel guitar is wonderfully depressing) without falling victim to the overwrought arrangements that detract a little from some of the other cuts. Gregg sounds even more world weary than usual here, and strikes just the right note for this material. Worth more than all the rest of his solo stuff put together."
5,One of the 10 Best of all time.,"This is one of the smoothest, kindest albums ever. Allman is like a white Stevie Wonder. The songs are constantly popping into your head. Does anyone know where I can find a copy?"
5,Great album! I need a copy on CD.,What's the deal? This is one of the best southern rock/blues albums ever. Why has this label been out of stock for so long?
4,just great!,"Forget all the babel! This album is great!. It can be argued It's as good as any a.b effort.The sound is wonderful and warm, as wonderful and as warm as greggs playing and his vocal.Beautiful arrangements.Great song choice.Great album."
4,good but not great,"i used the leather/plastic case made for the a950 before i tried this, my phone got a few scrapes from falling out way more easily than it should have and the camera lens was constantly being blocked by the case.for the most part this hard plastic version fixed that, it also is very simple and convienient to take off of the holster when you need to answer the phone.my only gripe with the product is the phone has come loose on occasion to pick up a few more scrapes. not the phone from the holster but the holster from my pants occasionally. this is only a problem because i choose to clip it horizontally as i find cliping it vertically makes this phone uncomftorble to wear under a seat belt.so for the most part i like this but just to let buyers know it may not be perfect if you choose to wear it on its side and dont want to scratch your phone"
1,Piece of Junk,Within the first two days the phone popped out of the clip.The top clip that keeps the phone in place requres very little pressure to release the phone. And the swivel is all over the place. Better buy phone insurance if you rely on this clip because you will either lose the phone or damage the thing from all the sidewalk bounce testing. I was actually impressed by how far the clip was able to launch the phone as I squeezed into the car. Thankfully there was no car in the adjacent parking spot or I would have had to crawl underneath to retrieve it. My LG VX4500 had the most secure clip of all the phones I have ever owned. It is pretty sad when you have to evaluate the holster as one of the features.
4,"Nice variety of songs, new and old.",My three year old was thrilled with this collection. I was impressed by the variety of songs and styles. I look forward to sharing the music with my preschool class.
1,Burned-out under light use.,"I noticed that this hub became very hot, even under light use (webcam, mouse, keyboard, USB thumb drive), and was nonfunctional after a week of use."
5,good,"It was fast and very good quality. Thank for taking care of your book so well, not many noticeable marks. Thank!"
2,Never forget: you get what you pay for,"How irritating. Not only did this not cover the specific, ""powerful"" ideas I was hoping for, but the ""report"" is only 16 pages long. The last 4 pages are the titles and order form for the company's umpteen other reports that I can also get. Each report covers one idea. So if I bought another three or four ideas that might be helpful, I'd end up spending [$$$]. I could have purchased an ENTIRE book for a fraction of that price!"
5,Still Going Strong,"Lynn Anderson's vocals are absolutely wonderful, as usual. I have always loved her mom's songs which take on a special quality in this album. The DVD is interesting."
5,Lynn is an Extraordinary Entertainer!,"The Bluegrass Sessions CD/DVD is remarkable. With Lynn's strong and rich voice it brings a new meaning to Bluegrass Music. This CD/DVD is a must have because it is totally AWESOME! No one else but Lynn can sing country, pop/rock, and now Bluegrass the way she can. This proves that Lynn is the most versatile singer in the music industry."
5,Lynn Anderson Bluegrass Sessions,This is a fantastic album. Lynn looks beautiful and sounds wonderful. It is great to hear so many of her hits done in a new way. Lynn Anderson remains a country music superstar and legend. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
4,"Another spinoff of starship troopers, but a fairly good one","Aromorines is a good game and has alot of elements that are taken from the movie starship troopers. It has fairly good graphics and gameplay, .... The game is about these elite millitary men who have special suits and a bunch of kick ... laser guns that will fry any bug that comes your way. The game takes place on a nearly overun planet earth where a bunch of bugs took over and are wiping out the human race. I like this game but for the most part I stand alone, ..."
4,Good value for money....,"If you are looking for a affordable and good headset, this would be it.I'd used it for a week now and everything is fine. The sound quality is pretty good.... sound is clear on my side as well as on the other side. One thing to note that is that the microphone is really sensitive... my friends can even hear ambient sounds in my room when I'm using it.This headset is light and quite comfortable to put on... even for long periods of time...I would recommend this to headset to casual users especially for internet telephony and such. If you are doing serious voice recording, go for a better headset...."
5,"MAJOR uplifting pride tracks...,","Julian Marsh does what he does best on this disc. It's happy, it's vocal, it's NRG, it's trance. And there are plenty of cover versions. The opening track is a take on ""Fly Robin Fly"" with a melody sung over the bassline. there's a corny cover of the Thompson Twins' ""Hold Me Now."" Erasure makes an appearance with their own song, and then have A Little Respect covered by someone else. There's a femal vocal NRG version of Unchained Melody, A pretty, trancey, commercial cover of the Styx track ""Come Sail Away,"" and for me, an unnecessary cover of Billie Ray Martin's ""Your Loving Arms."" Overall, this is quite a pride party. Track times:1. dance to dance (5:14)2. summer gonna come again (4:48)3. believe in you (3:27)4. riding on the wings (7:06)5. evergreen (5:56)6. what if (6:03)7. hold me now (5:33)8. come sail away (7:06)9. moon & the sky (6:16)10. unchained melody (5:48)11. a little respect (6:25)12. your loving arms (6:16)13. this is your life (6:40)"
1,Refund Never Received,"I returned this CD last month, and have yet to receive the refund back to my credit card to date. I wonder if I need to contact my bank, to dispute. It shouldn't take this long for a refund back to my card. What I am suppose to do?"
3,Best of Alex Jones so far,This is the best piece he has done so far. My only criticism is that Jones has made himself something of a laughing stock with other other works and is considered a disinformationist in many circles because of over the top dramatics and sensationalist antics. He is our worst enemy because he was used to discredit Ron Paul and now Jesse Ventura.
4,Fall of the Republic CD,"The premise is the existance of a shadow one-world government pulling the strings in Washington, making Republicans and Democrats irrelivant, both being controlled by their puppet masters. The premise is potentially valid in terms of ""The New World Order"" which has been touted since the G.H.W. Bush administration. Today we have an Administration focused on ""Progressive"" objectives that could well meld into part of a Global Power Structure based on the European Union model. Read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, and see how her experience with the Soviet Revolution of the early 20th Century could be the model for the ""One World Government"" postulated in Fall of the Republic in the 21st Century."
1,A Moron Is Born,"The one who pushed this agenda was Ronald Reagan. It has been the last thirty years of Reaganomics which gave corporations the real power to take over of America, destroying the middle class, the unions, and the American worker. Just look at how corporations already control our government and both major parties. Alex Jones is a Moron!"
2,It is a conspiracy theory documentary video,"I have just watched this documentary. I am not sure, it is true or not. But I am sure it is difficult to believe. Criticizing over the past is acceptable, but criticizing over Obama is way too soon, right now. I agree with Alex when he said, turning the tv off two hour or so, getting to know the neighbor and spending quality time with family and your love one. If you are a fan of weird conspiracy theory, you might like it."
4,Plain Fun,"This album is just plain fun. What a great combination: traditional Jewish liturgy and themes with Appalachian melodies and genre. Does that make this ""Jewgrass?"" Loved the album. Too much fun."
2,Rides of the borrowed,"2 1/2The once bludgeoning metal band continued opting down a well established path of pop-rock accessibility, offering a solid, if quite unnecessary EP which often borrows direct structural elements heard in Jupiter & Antenna, to less distinct success."
4,A Step In the Right Direction,"Cave In is a scary band. You know they haven't reached their full potential, yet they already are releasing fantastic material that can crush most of the other so-called rock that's out there. So that leaves you to ponder, ""Where are these guys going to end up?""This EP expounds on the band's 2000 album, Jupiter. The long (yet not boring), loud, and melodic songs are still there. But here on this EP they proved they can write a few lighter songs that still can pack quite a punch, displayed in ""The Calypso"" and the awesome title track, which starts off like a warm summer breeze that builds up into music that the band is better known for. If their upcoming LP expounds on this, we're going to realize we have something really special in Cave In."
5,Party Time,I just finished watching Party of Five Season 1 on DVD and I loved it. I've never been this into a television show. Please release the rest of the seasons quickly!
4,the costumers are treated like idiots!...,"Seriously it's a really great show and it reminds me of my childhood,but what's with the soundtrack?!!!!!!Like in dawson's creek,felicity and roswell,the original songs were replaced!...Such a shame for the show because it takes place on the beginning of nineteens so when i hear groups of our times,21 th century,it sucks a little because it didn't produce the same feeling...Anyway,i hope in france they will keep the original songs as in dawson's creek DVD edition...Great show though but as usual the DVDs ruined everything!..."
2,Party of Five is compared to,"Everytime I watch Party of Five it reminds me of Beverly Hills 90210. Bailey Salinger is compared to Brandon Walsh and Dylan Mckay, Charlie Salinger is compared to Steve Sanders, Julia Salinger is compared to Brenda Walsh, Claudia Salinger is compared to Kelly Taylor, Sarah Reeves is compared to Donna Martin and Griffin Holbrook is compared to David Silver."
5,"More seasons, please!","Party of Five is my favorite TV show. The acting is superb, the storylines are touching, and I've grown to feel emotionally invested in the Salinger family (I wonder how they're doing now :-p) It has been so much fun to watch the first season over again, even though the show got even better in later seasons. So, I CAN'T WAIT for them to release later seasons (particularly Season 3) on DVD!"
5,Please release MORE Party of Five on DVD!,"Wonderful show. I still have not recovered from this show's cancellation. If you release it, I will buy it!"
2,photo misleading,product shipped has no circuit breaker or knock out to install one. photo shows a circuit breaker. very deceptive and misleading photo.
3,comforter not big enough,"Good bargin, good sheets, good pillowcases, but the comforter is not a full queen size.. not big enough for two people to share.."
5,BEEN USING THIS LITTER FOR 6 YEARS & LOVE IT!,"Best kitty litter I've ever used in my 30 years of owning cats. I have 5 cats, and when I made the switch 6 years ago, I never had any problems for them adjusting. I just added some of the old clay litter, and gradually decreased it over a few days, until it was all SWHEAT. The litter doesn't hold a strong odor like clays, once a cat has gone in it. I also would recommend waiting a few minutes before scooping out wet litter right after your cat goes, it clumps better, but, overall, I scoop twice a day, and this is the best stuff! I highly recommend it. I will never go back to clay or any other litter."
3,Great Concept But it Doesn't Clump,"I'm thrilled that companies are coming out with natural litter products (as I was very concerned about the chemical clay stuff I had been using for my cat all of these years). I bought some of the Feline Pine (which I absolutely LOVE), but the Feline Pine original does not clump, so I bought the Swheat Scoop as a supplement to add a little clumping power to my Feline Pine. I was disappointed, as the Swheat does not clump at all. I'm glad that I that I didn't buy the Swheat product alone, as I wouldn't have been happy with my purchase. I prefer the Feline Pine because there's no dust and mess to have to sweep up all the time. Swheat is a great concept if it really clumped like it is supposed to. I would still prefer the Swheat over that chemical stuff I had been using in the past."
5,Outstanding,"The Gibbs at their creative peak, in my own humble opinion.I absolutely love ""My World""- a song so incredibly catchy, the minute you hear it, you'll be humming it all day.The whole album is superb. This is far removed from the disco (male) diva's they were about to become.Strings on every song, vocals dripping with sweet sentiment, their tademark vibratto harmonies unashamedly soar at every turn.A meloncholy set that just makes you ache... anything this beautiful should be illegal!!!"
3,Bee Gee's,"This CD was not as great as the previous one purchased as many unfamiliar songs were on it. However, it is still good.The product arrived in good shape and in a timely manner."
5,Best of Bee Gees CD,"CD arrived well packed, in mint condition and in good time. This was an international transaction and I would highly recommend the seller."
4,"Nice music, but not as good as Vol 1.","I am a fan of the Bee Gees. I have a small collection of their music. I think that this CD has many nice songs. Certainly, they are capable of creating beautiful tunes. The best song is probably the first ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart"".However, in my opinion, it pales in comparison with Volume 1. I think that this Volume 2 will be best appreciated by someone who has already tried out Volume 1, rather than an average newcomer."
3,"""Best of"" does not equal ""Greatest Hits""","This CD reminds me that ""Best of"" does not necessarily reflect what is/was widely loved. I felt that there were some very mediocre tunes on this disk and that you should take the time to listen to the sample music before purchasing this CD. I liked the disco era CD better, and regret purchasing this one, since I will rarely listen to it."

5,Capt. Gallant and a non P.C. France v.s. BAD ARABS,"Shades of pop culture boy did I enjoy these episodes seeing them again today.An amazing look at the attitudes toward the Middle East, Arabs and terrorists when fighting them was considered heroic. I hope they release the entire series! This series was made with cooperation of the French military i.e. The French Foreign Legion and actually cast and used real military in speaking roles. A great piece of pre-non p.c. pop culture. Buster Crabbe is great and so is Fuzzy Knight. Enjoy!"
2,Protecting the People and Keeping the Peace in North Africa,"Contains four black & white episodes: ""Camel Race,"" ""Cuffy's Good Deed,"" ""Revenge"" and ""The Boy Who Found Christmas."""
2,Fighting Bad Guys in the North African Desert,"This volume contains the following four black & white episodes: ""Spirit of Corps,"" ""The Search,"" ""Dr. Legionnaire"" and ""Legion Is Our Home."""
1,Too Embarrassed to Play for Second Graders,"I ordered this CD with the intention of using it in an art lesson on Paul Klee. I was planning to play the CD and have the students paint to the music, as Paul Klee himself was known to do. I REALLY should have listened to the samples before ordering this. It is absolutely AWFUL! I will not dare play this for a class of second graders, lest they think I am a crazy hippie and never ever take me seriously again. This is not good music by any standards today. However, maybe VERY young children might enjoy it. . . It has a sort of 1960s technicolor Scooby Doo kind of feel to it, if that happens to be what you are looking for."
5,Churchill's Jane Jeffery is my kind of neighbor.,"Jane Jeffery finds herself in the middle of a murder at, of all places, a cooking class. Her relationship with the local copper never deters her from working out who ""done it"" As usual, Churchill's wit keeps this book moving along and makes you eager for the next in this series."
3,"Another sitcom ending to the rescue... or rather, to the ruin","This book is almost decent... but it has one giant flaw. It's one of the earlier Jane Jeffries mysteries, and while I liked the main character more in this one, the mystery itself was kind of annoying. There was a great set-up, a limited number of suspects, and a decent storyline, but then the end seemed hurried, rushed, and incomplete. It was one of those books where you felt you should know more than you did - enough to really solve the mystery, but you didn't. It was short, though, so I didn't feel like it was a waste of time. It wouldn't be high on my list of recommended books, but it's not awful."
4,Jane Jeffrey is a wonderful character...,"Jane Jeffrey is a fun character to follow. I enjoyed this book b/c readers are able to meet Jane's mother - who is delightful. This story is interesting and I was very surprised at the ending! This series is awesome. Even if you happen to read one out of order, there is no trouble understanding the story. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries, comedy and fiction that is true to life."
3,"Well, I didn't really like quiche before this book.........","While I still remain a fan of Jill Churchill and her Jane Jeffry series, this book was a slight disappointment compared to her first two. This mystery revolves around Jane and her classmates in a week-long seminar she takes with her mother and sidekick/neighbor, Shelley. Naturally Jane gets involved when someone bumps off Mrs. Pryce, the crotchety old lady from class. Obviously it's one of the classmates, but who?Like the old saying, ""too many cooks spoil the broth?"" Well in this case I believe too many suspects spoiled the mystery! So while it didn't keep me from finishing the story (and guessing who did it before the end) it was a little too ""busy."" However, Churchill's writing style and flair for humor never cease, and for that reason it was worth reading."
2,A Quiche before Dying,"I must be missing something because this author's books get 5 stars. However, I felt the characters were never fully developed, that they lacked depth. Also some of the events seemed forced. I couldn't accept that they really would have happened so I was unable to be drawn into the story. An example of this is Mrs. Pryce inviting her classmates to her home for dinner. The book didn't so much bore as disappoint because the elements of a good mystery were there and the characters had the potential of growing on you. I'd consider this a light weight mystery. Unlike an Elizabeth George or even a Faye Kellerman mystery that pulls you into the story and keeps you thinking about it long after it's finished and whose characters you hate to say goodbye to."
3,HEIR APPARENT,My book is about a girl who plays a video. then after awile she will be dead forever. So she tries and tries to do everything she has to do to win. wile she was trying to protect people they were trying to bring her to the castel
5,wonderful,I read this story when I was younger and loved it so much that I found myself looking for it to read in so many bookstores and libraries later on in life that I knew I had to own it. I am glad I finally found it and have added it to my collection.
2,None,"this is an excellent book! however, DO NOT buy this for kindle... there is an unbelievable amount of typos that aren't in the paper version. parenthesis in the middle of words, 'feet' instead of 'feat', and some are so bad i have a hard time understanding the text! not your best kindle..."
5,The book that's a video game,"This book is almost like playing a video game. The story is a lot like video games you have played; there is a commoner who needs to solve some puzzles, get past a dragon, get the ring, make friends with the right people and if she does it correctly she wins the game by being crowned king. Of course what normally happens when you play a video game the first time, you die. Well just like the game, if you die you start over and have to do it all over again. Fortunately out main character is pretty smart so it isn't too repetitive, she makes better choices as the game goes on. Oh and here's the twist if she doesn't win she can't get out of the game."
4,Different but satisfying.,"Giannine father's sends Giannine a $50 gift certificate for her B-day to play at a Rasmussem Gaming Center and get's caught up in a whirlwide of magic and intrigue when she choses Heir Apparent, the role-playing game.At first she dies a when I can swear is a billion times(which get's annoying and repetitive), but she gets the hang of it eventually and doesn't die....so much. The only problem is that Giannine has a very limited amount of time thanks to some protesters who damaged some equipment.....A very promising novel, and a quick read. Impending doom is demonstrated well, a realistic atmosphere to the plot of the game itself, and occasional bursts of humor(I recommend reading the dedication to get an idea of Velde's witty humor). The third, and best, novel I have read by Velde. And as I write this I have a feeling that I will be reading it again sometime soon, for it does go on my list of the top books I've read."
5,An AWESOME book!,"Heir Apparent is one of the greatest books I have ever read, and believe me when I say I've read literally thousands of books! (and I'm only 14)Anyway, this is a very realistic book. I felt like I was right next to Janine. The author does a great job of being descriptive, but not overloading. (Pardon the pun!)The plot was very imaginative and different.When I read the description, I thought, ""oh, this'll just be another book with a magic ring and a dragon and all that."" But it wasn't. Usually, when there are magic items in the plot, they are the main concern. This time, they helped, but weren't always there, depending on which level of the game Janine was on.I also thought that the book uses futuristic stuff very ingeniously. I mean, I never would have thought of taking a virtual game and combining it with a magic ring.Overall, this book was absolutely fantastic. I HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,Soundtrack to the Documentary,"I just purchased the Moog documentary on dvd as well as the soundtrack. The film is simply quite amazing and a must see for all fans of documentary films as well as music buffs in general. While watching the film the music caught my attention. Wall to wall original compositions made specifically for the film. All the great Moog bands of the modern age: Stereolab, Tortoise, Devo, Gary Numan, Yes, Roger from The Cure, etc. Great music to sit back and let your thoughts run wild. I left one star off for no Wendy Carlos or Stevie Wonder (although it is explained why in the Directors Commentary on the dvd)."
5,Wild Soundtrack!,Hello -- Amazing Soundtrack! One of the best purchases I've made CD-wise in a long time. I had no idea the Moog synths were used as much as they are. Jean Jacques Perrey is back folks in a monster way. How old is the guy? Like 80 or something! He's still ripping the big beats like nobody's business. And what about Charlie Clouser from Nine Inch Nails! That guy kicks some serious butt and takes names. His beats made me want to weep with joy. If you have any interest in a killer electronic music soundtrack get out your wallet and but this ASAP.
3,"Half good, half just ""OK""","I got this soundtrack mainly for the Charlie Clouser track, and fortunately was not disappointed there. His track is fantastic. The Meat Beat Manifesto track contains his usual breakbeat, funky goodness. So many of the other tracks were not my cup of tea, so to speak. Many of them seemed either too experimental or just plain goofy sounding. I'll give it another listen, but overall, I'm not too crazy about the album as a whole."
2,Poor,"bullets and bruises is a very piss poor effort from the rock quartet autovein. pretty much every song sounds the same as the last. vocals are copped from the exies, guitar parts are uninteresting, and the music itself is repetitve and stale. pass on this one."
4,AWSOME GAME!,"I was looking through toys""r""us when I saw thisgame. I couldn't belive [the price]. It looked like a pretty good gameso I got it. It is a very cool game. I only gave it 4 out of 5 starsbecause it is very difficult. Some good things about this game arethere is a wide selection of weapons, very good color and top notchgraphics I recommend this game for people ages 10-20 because it isvery hard."
5,We MADE Winx Club,"Hey, it's us, winx club's biggest fans! Musa, Bloom and Stella! Yep, those are our REAL names! We have all the winx club stuff, everything! Bloom is cool, but someone said they are winx's top fan. They are lying! We knew about before them, because our mum helped make the TV show and stuff. We helped a bit. We made what they looked like, something like us! We even decided to give them our names. We live in Italy, where winx was made, but we speak english coz we are from england! Don't beleive us? At least we know the truth!"
5,bratz vs winx,"HELLO!! BRATZ BETTER WATCH OUT BECAUSE BLOOM, STELLA , FLORA, MUSA AND TECNA ARE HERE!!! BLOOM HAZ 2 B MY FAVE WINX DOLL BECAUSESHE IS SOO PRETTY AND I JUST GOT HER WITH PRINCE SKY AKA BRANDON, AND STELLA. THEY ARE THE BEST!!!!"
2,not worth the money!,my daughters got these for christmas and they were broke that same day.the wings pulled the back off and we kept losing the batteries.so we glued it now it won't light up. my girls were very disapointed.
5,The perfect role model for girls!,"My daughter LOVES the Winx Club! She has ballet class when it comes on, so she makes her Daddy SWEAR to record it for her, and as soon as she gets home, she puts on what she calls her Winx Fairy outfit and pops in the tape! The really bad part is that WE like the cartoon as much as SHE does! We were absolutely delighted to find the dolls at our local Toys'R'Us, and I wish we had bought them as soon as we saw them - Now we have to track them down before we can buy them!As a mother, I am extremely pleased with the message that the Winx give to girls: To believe in themselves and find the special magic within them. They're smart, beautiful, loyal to each other, and they aren't shy shrinking violets - They won't sit around waiting for some prince to save them.... In fact they are very likely to be the ones DOING the rescuing! Finding Winx Dolls under the Christmas tree next week is going to make my little girl VERY happy!"
4,Really lethal tunes!,"When I was looking at this in the record store I was really skeptical. But after listening to the first track, I was hooked! The ""Natural Born Killaz"" song by Atomic Dog is a really dark and lethal hardstep tune with lots of choppy amens. And words can't describe the smooth ambience of ""Autumn Days"" by Wink. Overall, this is a good compilation. The bouncy bassline on the re-mix of ""Hotstepper"" by Ini Kamoze will surely have all the bredren and sistren hopping mad pon de dancefloor ceen! Add this to your drum'n'bass collection! Laterz."
3,Not really what I expected..,"The DVD is fairly intensive, and depicts basic combinations for all three skill levels. It also includes mostly barre work, but that was useless as I do not have a ballet barre in my house. I wanted this DVD so I could continue strength training while I was not in my pointe classes, instead I got some material which is more appropriate for a ballet teacher who might be short on ideas. Its not really what I wanted, but I guess its better than nothing."
4,"intellectual, stimulating murder mystery","a wonderful murder mystery, with enough twists and turns to keep the reader engaged. the author's knowledge of the therapuetic community was good, and the setting was excellent. delightful reading."
1,Truly amateurish.,"I had a lot of hopes for this, in large part based on the high-star reviews given, and because of how great S. Y. Agnon was (another Israeli author). However, I'm having a very hard time getting through this because of how badly -- truly amateurishly -- written this is. The first dictum of writing is ""show, don't tell."" That means use dialogue and exposition effectively, don't endlessly narrate. Guess what, this is endless narration. Worse, the author uses the ""omniscient"" approach. She is in everybody's head at once, narrating how they feel, what they're thinking, etc., etc. I personally am stopped in my tracks whenever I confront that level of bad writing. I don't think the author has had any training as a writer whatsoever. A very great disappointment."
5,Wry Humor at It's Best,"I found this book extremely funny, but in a delightfully honest way. Mr. Mallet has some very good insights to offer for a look into the human psyche."
5,Frazz is a winner!,"If you are not already familiar with the Frazz comic strip, you are missing out on one of the more thoughtful and well written comics that are currently in syndication. Jef Mallett displays keen observational insight concerning people and life experiences through the eyes of an elementary school janitor and it's students and faculty, and usually leaves you thinking and laughing at the end of each strip. Live at Bryson Elementary is a collection of comics from the beginning of the strip's history, and you will see a little bit of subtle difference in the appearance of the characters as the series progresses. This book would make a great introduction to the world of Frazz for the uninitiated, or a great trip down memory lane for those who have been in the know for years."
5,"FRAZ,Z at Bryson Elementary","One of the finest comic strip collections of all times: insightful, great vocabulary, moral messages, just plain funny. Very well done. Should be required reading for all adults."
2,not enough behind-the-scenes information,"If you want a good behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Krofft shows, this isn't the book - it is more of a warm-and-fuzzy remembrance. Perhaps this was a little too ""authorized"". Too many dubious-sounding and self-serving ""facts"" are given by the Brothers Krofft. The author seems to have done little research on his own, and depends completely on interviews with a few people. Far too many times in the book, someone would say ""I don't know whatever happened to so-and-so"" - and the book just leaves it that way instead of doing a little legwork and looking. How about a few more pictures? If the author really had access to the Krofft archives, he should have included a few more photos."
5,My Childhood Revisited,"What a great read. ""Pufnstuf & Other Stuff"" reminded me how captivated I was as a child with Saturday morning TV shows like ""Pufnstuf"" and ""The Bugaloos."" It brought me back. But the author did far more than just rehash. He seems to have gone the extra mile by tracking down people who worked on these shows, in front of and behind the camera. I actually laughed out loud many times at some of the wacky behind-the-scenes stories. It's amazing to me that nobody wrote the Kroffts' story before now."
4,"Good content, but could use more cast interviews",I found the book to be especially enlightening to the mysterious (I thought) world of the Kroft Bros. Now if only there was an updated Land of the Lost Movie on the horizon.
3,"Great little insights, author sounds like a jerk","I haven't finished reading it yet, but so far it's a good little coffee table book. Why I think the author sounds like a jerk: when he describes the Bugaloos, he says she's pretty and the blonde and brunette ones are handsome. What does he say about the the only Bugaloo you can tell what he is supposed to BEE? That he was black and that it's obvious by his brown and yellow stripes, he must be a bee. It was very disappointing for he deserved to be described as handsome too. So, if you can get by Martindale's biased descriptions, then you'll enjoy the non-descriminating facts."
4,Goldsmith has a flavor of music....,"that is never the same. Maybe it's because he does so many different film albums (unlike Horner and Williams' music, which is, in many occasions, almost identical. Here Goldsmith uses a Saharian flavor and lot's of child chorals to express an ingenious harmony (with many notes and vibrant instruments used in The Ghost In The Darkness). CONGO, however short (only 30 minutes) and irritatingly labeled (the CD's tracks are listed on the back in total disarray), the music is timeless, a word so often accociated with Goldsmith's work."
4,Interesting Indeed!!,"Dinosaur Adventure 3D is a very interesting piece of software. It's full of activities, games, videos and lots more..."
3,Dinosaur Adventure 3-D,This game may scare younger children especially if they play this game in the evening or just before bed-time and the 3-D glasses have a tendency to break.
2,Poor quality,"We bought this for our 3 year old based on the reviews found here. We were surprised at the poor quality of the software. The sound kicks in and out which means you can't hear all of the instructions. We had an extremely difficult time, trying to figure out how or where to find the eggs. The concept is very creative and wonderful for little boys who like dinosaurs. I just think they need to work out some of the bugs within the software."
5,Excellent fun for 6-8 year olds,"My 6 and 8 year old daughters love this CD-ROM. I like it too. The pictures are beautiful and it's easy to figure out how to play the games. My 5 year old finds it a little hard to collect the eggs that are the point of the game overall, but she still likes to play it."
5,Constructive criticism,"My 3 1/2 year old loves this game. She has been on it for hours a day (no tv!). The graphics and sounds are great. There are games, movie clips, or educational tidbits everywhere. Even I am learning all about the many dinosaurs. My daughter enjoys moving around the landscapes and watching clips as much as actually playing the games. A 4 year old familiar with a mouse can accomplish most all the games on level 1. The work book is a great idea! JC can color or work puzzles thereby allowing ME to use my computer!For the critique, though, my 3 year old says there should be more than 1 way to beat the T Rex. I agree. So much effort was put into this program. It seems anticlimatic since there is only 1 ending. Maybe next version! Hint Hint!"
5,Dinosaur Adventure 3D,"What a great game! I wish they had something like this when I was a kid. This game brings dinosaurs to life for young kids (4-8). Unlike the 'Land Before Time' videos and other kid geared dino stuff, this game actually teaches about dinosaurs while making the learning fun. The interface is well geared for the recommended age group and the quality of the game is outstanding. If your kids like dinosaurs then this game is not to be missed."
2,"Not compatible with Windows Me, 2000, or XP","Our 4-year old daughter really likes this game. It is not violent (except for the opening scene of a T-Rex knocking down rocks). The games are cute and enjoyable.Unfortunately, the software is not compatible with newer operating systems such as Windows Me, 2000, or XP. The sound cuts in and out or stops completely and there is no way to fix it. (Technical support will tell you that the operating systems are unsupported.) Be aware that unless you are still running Windows 95 or 98, you are going to have this problem. You can still play the games--BUT, in order to find the dinosaur eggs you have to listen to verbal clues from Rolf, the guide dinosaur. Therefore, since we can't hear the verbal hints, we have yet to find any eggs."
5,An Excellent Book,"The book is about using the C compiler to program microcontrollers, the 8051 series. I found the book to be extremely useful during my undergraduate studies and my final year project.You can get a free Keil C compiler from the site www.keil.com or from the site: www.hitex.co.ukThe book explains working tested projects and not just the theory. Well done the author."
1,Please do not buy,"This book is a simple listing of c codes. Waste of money. I was expecting some more about linking, hints about the C51 compiler this is a hobbiest book for enterprise money. Cheat"
5,Glad I chose this book,"Excellent tutorial for the 8051 hardware novice on how to use the C language to develope simple 8051 control projects, gaining valuable insights on port access and program setup that can lead to more complicated projects developed by the user."
5,wonderful Work,I think his book expresses things in a very positive way. I have really learned some new things about my body that I did not know before. I really recommend that you read this book because you may also learn some really great ways to improve your body especially if you are feeling a little down about the New Year coming and your body is not feeling so ready for the new Millenium.
4,Great viewing,"Brings back lots of memories of how TV interpreted an era in which I grew up in. Even though some of the elements were not in my own experiences, the format is enlightening."
4,Good show and still fresh,Season 2 is still pretty funny with their original concept of a bunch of 70s high school friends being goofy.
5,leaf,"If there's one thing that makes me laugh even when I just think about it, it's That 70's show. I just ordered the DVD of the second season, but I've been watching this show on upn 11 every day since I don't know how long ago. On upn 11 they play the same episodes over and over again, for some episodes, I have watched them for at least 5 times, but they still make me laugh when I watch them. Every Wednesday, they play the new episodes on Fox, although the new ones are not as good as the old ones, I never missed one single episode. Even when I have to do something and am not home, I have to record the show and watch it later."
5,Awesome show,"The show starts in 1976. I 'came of age' a few years before that, but it was still the 1970s, and I can say this show is quite realistic. The censors let some things that were very commonplace at that time make it to the air, which is pretty unusual in this PC era. I don't like canned laughter, so I appreciate the fact that it was taped before a live audience. The only season I don't particularly care for is the last one. No Topher Grace, no Ashton Kutcher (not on a regular basis, anyway), Donna had gone blonde (what??) and there was that new guy.. can't remember his name. The show was pretty much finished by then, which is unfortunate, but nothing this good could last forever. In the last season, the only characters who still had good lines were Kitty and Red, and those seemed strained at times. All in all, a wonderfully entertaining sitcom, and while I'm sorry to see it go, I'm glad it's available on DVD."
2,bootleg?,"Was a great price. BUT, Horrible quality! Which is such a disappointment since I'm a huge Amazon shopper on a weekly basis!"
5,Season 2 That 70's Show,"Great humor; the kind you don't find in TV shows today! I never tire of watching these shows! If you've never seen, get it!"
4,Modern Glasgow Crime,"Peter Turnbull has in-depth characters, and breathes life into police procedural crime. In Two Way Cut PC Phil Hamilton of P division finds a corpse on a stretch of rain-sodden waste ground, its severed head resting neatly on its chest. Forensic evidence revealed that the murdered man, a meticulous, hard-working accountant, had been killed elsewhere, and his body washed and laid out in immaculate new clothing."
1,tomb raider,will not play on my pc graphics are too fast piece of junk not the sellers fault but description could have been more thorough never could get my money back
2,Not what I am used to hearing from this Comedian,"Disappointed wtih this selection. Compared to his CD ""skanks for the memories"", Dave Attel just does not seem prepared for this presentation. We were waiting for great material but although we had a few laughs the CD just ended without a great overall impression. Material seemed not well prepared. Not what we are used to hearing from this comedian."
4,Smiler for $6.98?,"Are you kidding? The cover of Dylan's ""Girl from the North Country"" is worth $6.98!"
3,not what i hoped it would be,"i love old rod stewart (and the faces) and this album starts off with a bang sweet little rock 'n'roller is what i wish the rest of this cd sounded like.farewell and salior,dixie toot and hard road are good songs and the saving ""mine for me ""at the end.all in all this isnt a bad album it just wasnt what i hoped it would be.seems like it needed more ronnie wood."
2,Bought it for one track,"And that is ""You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Man"". Used to listen to it over and over on vinyl as a kid. Guess best advice is to find that song on-line."
4,A Fine Stewart Effort,"A nice remaster of a very good album. Notable that it contains the only collaboration between Rod and Paul McCartney to date on the final, McCartney-penned track, ""Mine for Me."" McCartney also sings beautiful background vocals on this fine tune. The rocking ""Let Me Be Your Car"" was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin. The only downfall is that the CD has no bonus tracks - rare for a classic reissue."
3,Half Smile,"Smiler is by far the weakest album that Rod Stewart released on the Mercury label. It has some excellent performances, but it is spotty in most spots. The album starts off with a ripping song, ""Sweet Little Rock 'N' Roller"" but then falls off until his medley cover of Sam Cooke's ""Bring It on Home To Me/You Send Me"". Mr. Stewart is a major devotee of Mr. Cooke's and he always steps up his level of performance on covers of his songs. ""let Me Be Your Car"" is an enjoyable number, but he makes a rare, but major, misstep on ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Man"". By singing it from a man's point of view, it strips the song of its essence. The rest of the album is up and down. Smiler could have been alot better, but it is not a wasted effort."
4,Classic Rock,"I forgot all about this album until recently. This was recorded back when Rod and Ronnie were rockers and balladeers. His duet with Elton John has me tapping my toes even when driving, which I know isn't a safe thing to do. Listening to this, I 'm taken back to the early 70's when rock was genuine and fun."
4,Swedish Delight,This is a recording that grows on you. It is not so frenetic or edgy as other recordings by the group. One finds the music growing more pleasant and genial with each hearing.
3,Old fashioned murder mystery,"Agatha Christie read Wallace for inspiration, which kind of says it all. Competent but old fashioned, and with a touch of British Imperial racism. Slow and steady, perhaps a little on the dull side. The characters never really blossom into life: neither the heroes nor the villains. There is a reason why Wallace is forgotten while Conan Doyle is remembered, still if you are a crime buff you need to be able to converse intelligently about Wallace, and this book is as good as any to get stuck into."
4,complex whodunnit,Excellent period mystery with satisfying twists and turns (some of them a bit far-fetched).Kept my attention all the way through.Not his best work but well worth the reading effort.
3,Interesting Read,This old fashioned crime novel was the first of Edgar Wallace's books I have read. The plot was engaging with a few suspects being unearthed in the murder of an obnoxious man. Some of the terminology was very old fashioned including the way his Chinese companion was referred to. The book still had enough twists and turns to be able to hold my interest to the very end. Overall it was not a bad read.
1,The Daffodil Mystery,This was the most boring book. It was so predictable from the the very beginning. I don't expect to read this author again.
1,If you are a fan this is not what you are looking for,"This is a load of crap.If you are a fan you want what makes pearl jam the greatest band in the world.........LIVE LIVE LIVE music....you get none of that on this just crap...It is unautherized and that is with good reason Pearl jam is a high quility thing and this dvd is not.......If you are a fan stay away.....Oh all the ""new 2010 footage"" is from the 2000 dvd touring band eddie has the same 2010 beard lol .....If you lived this era no need to buy but if you have had your head up your.... well the place the sun don't shine....or have a skull full of manure this is a 5 star movie lol"
5,The Best of Ray Stevens - Import CDs,"Import CDs did a great job in getting this to me for such a low price. GOOD VALUE! This CD was used,but in perfect condition. I expect it will be a collectible since it contains the earliest Ray Stevens I ever heard. It is serious music with a couple of comedy tunes which did not translate so well into the Queen's english. (It happens with audiences.) Apparently, Ray Stevens found his niche after this in comedy and the world is a better place for it!!! At 9.99pounds sterling, (sorry no Pound symbol on this keyboard), it is a super deal.It was shipped and delivered with other orders within a week, even though it had to go through customs in addition to domestic shipping."
4,great music,"A great set of older songs. I have been looking for some of them, especially, ""Queen of the Silverdollar"" for years and was happy to finally find a CD that included it. I have about worn them out already."
2,Mis-Leading Product Discription,"The Soprano that I sing with at an Italian Restaurant Purchased this CD to accompany us while singing ""La Ci Darem"" from Don Giovanni . . . during our first rehearsal with the track we discovered that the Soprano Voice is not on the Track, but the Baritone still is . . . upon further inspection, the Soprano is not on the performance tracks of any of the Duets (or Trios) but all other voices are.Basically if you are a Soprano without a good Mezzo, Tenor and Baritone at your disposal you'll have a blast singing these duets with some great Voices accompaning you.Have Fun"
1,Disappointed,"The first time I heard Eres Tu was in the movie, Tommy Boy, believe it or not. After years of remembering that song and recently hearing it BEAUTIFULLY sung on the Lawrence Welk Show, I ordered it. Upon receiving it and playing it for the first time, my enthusiasim waned. Although the lyrics are simple and meaningful, which I love, the singing voices are much to be desired. The rest of the album is not much better. Perhaps, if I listen to it enough, I will accept their unrefinement. Then again, I think not. Does anyone know if a cover was ever made for Erest Tu?"
4,Playfully profound,"Don't let the playful title of this book fool you - there is great depth and wisdom in this book. I believe that seasoned Zen practitioners will find as much to enjoy in this book as will ""beginners' mind"" students of Zen. In fact, this book is likely to make a welcome and playfully profound addition to anyone's mind."
5,details the occupation of lobstering - great for kids!,My son and I go to Maine for vacations. We picked up this book and have begun picking up lobster toys. He really loves it!
5,First DVD of Music and Arts,"I enjoy the quality of the DVD, the first Japanese singer in MALFC and the songs. The presentation of this album is great. ""Praise and Worship"" is my favorite because it has the hint of ""Taste and See"" from ""Angels Will Be Singing."" ""Love By Thee"" is my second favorite. It is definitely a romantic love song of worship. I am glad it is a part of my Music and Art Collection, which I have all recordings dating back to 1983 (the first one was ""Live In Atlanta"")."
4,Great songwiting and superb ministry in song,"These are my peeps;been affiliated with the Music and Arts/Love Fellowship since 1980 and always look forward to the next seminar/recording. This one is one of the best to have come out in the last decade! Add to that an enthusiastic performance in ministry by the choir/musicians and you've got a great time to be enjoyed over and over again. Why folk wait for another choir to end up covering these selections to a less stellar effect is beyond me. Do your ears,eyes and spirit a favor and get this project....you won't be disappointed, but blessed!"
2,soap opera acting,"The scenes were overacted and therefore non-engaging. Plus scenes were unrealistic, fluffy and phooney. I like to see real people even if they are not your body beautiful people."
2,"Check sales price first in stores, this one is very expensive priced","I have purchased this video package last Sunday 8/21/2011 at a Target store for $ 29.99, it was brand new and factory sealed product, why the price here is almost $ 60.00 ? shop around before you buy ... whoops they raise the price with another $ 10.00"
1,Not worth to buy,"I purchase this scale, it worked great for just 4 months.Now it is not working.Very Disappointed."
1,"Mine died, too","Really liked mine for about 2 years until it started to get flaky. Put a new battery in, and was still flaky, in a different way... Called their customer service who said I should buy a new one."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"I purchased this item April 2001. It worked great at first but it refused to work 4 months later. I tried a new battery even though the first battery was still good. I returned the scale to the store where I purchased it and they gave me another. I could not get a refund because I was returning it after the store's 90 return period. I got the new scale home and it did not work either! Same problem. It would turn on, but would not show the weight. A piece of junk."
1,no good...don't buy,"I bought this scale to weigh my kid's pinewood derby car. It was a little tedious at best right out of the box. With a little patience I got it to work correctly. I put the scale away, and got it out the following year for the same reason. This time, however, I get nothing but a bunch of dashes across the LCD. Waste of money."
1,Very erratic results - a scale that gives a range of weights?,"This scale was a complete waste of money. It seemed to work well for a few months, then started registering different weights for the same item or not registering a weight at all, even after changing batteries. The only advice I got to my inquiries of customer service was to toss this one and buy a new one. Another scale from Royal? I don't think so. Someone should explain the importance of reliability -- of a scale and of customer service -- to the clueless gang at Royal."
5,Appreciating wonderful music,Ms. O.Adams I have always been a big fan with the 1st. cd there is something wonderful about a artist(espically a female) who can play a piano and sing I really love that combination I just wished you would come to Atl.Ga. the last time u were here was for WCLK's anniversary and i enjoyed that evening so much hopefully something will come up where u can b booked to come back continue the wonderful work just know i will always purchase your music w/out hesitation Your one Artist i dont have to ? whether its going to b good or not much success in your future endevaors Sincerly Atl.Ga
5,Oleta Is As Pure As A Fine Diamond,"A woman with diamond hard elegance and a voice so pure and exceptionally out of this world. I never get tired of listening to the song, Bump In The Road. I hear it over and over and over.Never get tired of it. I couldn't wait til this CD was released in the United States, so I special ordered it thru the internet, from another country, paid a high freight charge, which I didn't mind because I knew it was well worth it. Glad I did!"
3,Middle ground,"There's no denying she has a spectacular voice -- and for that alone the CD is worth hearing and rated a more generous 3 stars -- but the material is just OK (with better highlights including ""I Hope You Dance"" and ""I Can't Live A Day Without You"",) and the production is so routine and at times awful. Where's the great producer for this great talent? Oleta Adams deserves better than treading this treacly water."
1,An Amazingly Useless Book,"Filled with generalities and common sense statements, this book had NO specific information about any Florida community. It tells you things like the further north you go, the cooler the temperatures might be, or suggests to you that you consider whether you would rather live inland or along the shore. But there are no comparisons between cities or specific information provided about any Florida location in the book.After buying and reading this book, I am absolutely no closer to determining what Florida community would be best for me to relocate to, nor, due to the lack of references in the book, am I any closer to locating the type of specific information I was looking for."
4,"Very, very useful!","This little book is kind of like a ""Cliff Notes"" on relocating to Florida. There are no boring, 10-year old statistics and no well-intentioned author's opinions and recommendations. It is just a quick read full of valuable tips on things to consider if you choose to relocate to Florida. We found it very helpful."
2,Too General,"I was disappointed in the content as it is very general in nature. It covers such topics climate, housing types, water quality, activities, taxes, crime, insurance, etc, but the lack of specifics left me wanting more. Much of this information could be applicable to anyone looking at relocating and purchasing property in almost any state."
1,Guyana?,"This book is so general it could refer to anyplace in the world. It should be titled ""Things to think about when moving""."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"As other customers expressed in their reviews, this book lacks any depth. I was looking for detail information to help my parents in their move to Florida. Instead, I felt they could have wrote this book. Save your money, please. This book is not worth [the money]. It's not even worth the cost of a magazine. It's full of vague or general information that any average American already knows."
4,Painfully funny,"A full frontal assault against celebrity worship and its deletorious effect on the American psyche, ""Colors Insulting to Nature"" is not a perfect novel. There are a few too many authorial asides restating the theme - yes, we get that basing your life decisions on the movie ""Fame"" is not a path to personal happiness. That said, this is one of the funniest books I have ever read. The protagonists' staging of ""Sound Of Music"" is the best kind of parody - one done with affection and understanding of the source material - and had me laughing so hard that I nearly aspirated my burrito. Highly recommended."
1,Writing Insulting to . . . Writing,"Oscar Wilde wrote that literature is unread and journalism is unreadable. Cintra Wilson, while aspiring toward the former, can't shake the fact that she's only good at the latter; however, defying Wilde's epigram, her journalism, when it's what she intends to write, is really good. That said, 'Colors Insulting to Nature' is one of the worst books I've ever read. How it got published is beyond me. It's the literary equivalent of cat art. This was a surprise to me because I've always enjoyed reading her columns, especially her post-Oscar ones, and I enjoyed her previous non-fiction book on celebrity culture. But this book is a travesty. It's an appalling mess, and I feel more duped for falling for the advance praise and other reader accolades on this site, than Oprah was by believing James Frey."
4,Very good hard/psych rock with an ear to the ground,"I hear The Who and The Move's influences on some tracks. Also, fans of The Real Kids, Johnny Thunders, and the like could get behind this too. And for those who wondered where in ""Brooklyn"" Sir Lord Baltimore* might have come from, the liner notes give a clue: The Koala are described as hailing from the East New York neighborhood.*I say this because the Koala's ""Louis Caine"" later became SLB's guitarist."
3,Good,"This is pretty good rock by a band discovered by the Blues Magoos. This sole album by Koala came in 1969.There is not a lot of invention, but by garage standards, this is very well written and well recorded. The instrumentation is typical bass drums and guitar, but the music is a little more fleshed out than a lot of the garage bands of the time.The singer also has a great, blue eye soul voice. If you want truely inventive music from this genre, check outEmergeby Litter.But for what this is, and it does not claim to be anything else, it is great."
2,red herring,"zizek is trapped in lacan, hegel, heidegger...he has no solution to the loss of subjectivity because these philosophers are the reason for objectification...zizek, zisk means 'profit'...just like the greek myths were meant to instill mass objectification among its subjects, so too, the modern re-introduction via freud, lacan circulate the same objectivity, paramount for capital and social order, pretending to solve its enigma, the solution is the reason and cause...it all justifies objectivity by arguing the ultimate loss of self and realm of Other and chaos...its tautological...its fraudulent...the last chapter deals with Christianity, sort-of, the rest is weird lacanian, hegel mumbo...this is why zizek is popular, he has no solution nor wants one...read baudrillard if you are really interested in how capital controls"
5,Great recumbent bike,"I love this bike! It's finally a pleasure to exercise. It has all the features I want (heart rate monitor, calories burned, timer) at a great price."
4,Frame Fit Pump!,"Another relatively hard to find item in this day and age. It works well. Provides good pressure. A little on the fragile side compared to my old Silca and Zefal pumps of the mid to late 70's. The finish scars easily and the gromet that fits over the presta valve, easily distorts, making it difficult to reinsert the dust plug. Other than that, it's fine."
3,Could be better,"This pump looks good and feels good, but does not grip well to the head of my presta valves. Therefore, it's usually a chore to pump my tires. Thankfully I don't have to do that too often. My previous pump brand was Zefal, and I didn't have this kind of difficulty with that pump. Unfortunately it was lost or stolen."
2,No point,"There is no real point in this album and probaly was put out by producers to generate profits. First off the album is 6 measley songs, nothing long just 6 normal songs. There is no real diffrence in the live versions of these songs over the recorded ones. They also were taken from what most agree to be his two worst albums (Ultimate Sin and No rest for the Wicked) if you are intrested buy those two albums. not a combination with 2-3 songs from each."
2,I HATE SAYING THIS!,"First I want to apologize to OZZY and everyone else like me who loves OZZY more than life itself, when I say that this is the worst thing he's ever done. I've seen him in concert 13 times in 7 different states, and this is a poor excuse for a live recording. Miracle Man; Bloodbath In Paradise; and Tattoo Dancer, although good songs, just aren't the kind of songs that sound that great live. Shot in the dark is just too MTV pop for me anyway. Sweet Leaf and War Pigs; undoubtedly 2 of the all time greatest songs he ever did, sounded better on Speak Of The Devil. Maybe it's the band, or the amount of time it took to record this album,(It's definitely not OZZY's fault)or maybe OZZY just needed some quick cash. I don't know, but OZZY's 1000 times better live than this. For a die-hard OZZY fan like me, it's a must-have; but for someone hungry for live OZZY, I recommend ""Speak Of The Devil"" ""Tribute"" & ""Reunion""Sincerely, NITEMARE"
1,The Ozzman has came but will never leave!,the ozz helped us rock through the years and never stopped so I am going to show my appreciaion by wtiting this column. He rocked with good times and bad times with Sabbath then he gave all he could with rock idol Randy Rhoads and blistered with Zaak. So really he can build up a great hit with any one and that song woulg go straight to the rock charts. He has been blessed with a gift (a talent) to give us the rock that we want. but going to this album I think that it is awesome to do Sabbath songs and Ozzy songs all on one album. Which is why I like this album.
3,It's not bad.,"Just Say Ozzy is a pretty good disc. It's just over thirty minutes in length. It contains six live tracks. All six tracks are energetic and worth a listen. Four of the tracks come from his solo albums, and two of them are Black Sabbath songs. This re-mastered edition sounds really nice. These tunes were recorded in 1989. Ozzy and the other members of his band do a good job throughout. The live version of ""Shot in the Dark"" is pretty cool. The photos in the liner notes are also interesting. Just Say Ozzy contains some good live tracks. Worth a listen."
3,Ozzy Does Sabath,"This live EP i not half bad and Ozzy sings well on it, my only beef is that it seems to be an excuse for the record label to make some more money. Let's face it there is no shortage of Ozzy live material to b found. Shot In The Dark is an improvement over the studio version and it's cool to hear the Sabbath tracks but let's face it. Noone can do them like the original band."
3,Mini Live Cd,"I found this Ozzy live CD at my local Malmart for a measly 5 bucks. The sound quality is o.k, but when i saw Ozzy live it was much more aggresive than it is here. A weak track selection only makes this good for those wanting to quit. Heavy metal is addicting and promotes satanism and foul language. Whether Ozzy is a satanist or not is debatable- he's not telling anyone. With his TV show over, his fame abd life are just waiting for the big goodbye when Ozzy isn't here to make metal cool again. This is probably the weakest Ozzy album available to the general public, but not bad for 5 bucks."
4,The best version of War Pigs of all time!,"This live ep is very good.Ozzy Osbourne,Geezer Butler,Zakk Wylde and Randy Castillo made a very good lineup.The bass on this record is exeptionnal.All songs are very well recorded;Miracle Man is very good (the intro at the beginning made a great ambiance),Bloodbath In Paradise,Shot In The Dark,Tatooed Dancer are very well played.For the classics Sabbath songs;Sweet Leaf is pretty cool but,the song is shorter than the original).And for War Pigs;THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF WAR PIGS I HAVE HEARD IN MY LIFE! I suggest this live ep for all Ozzy and Sabbath fans."
5,Just Say Ozzy!,"oh Yeah! Just Say Ozzy!! i love this EP album!! Ozzy's vocals are great,amazing,fantastic, like always. 6 tracks only but oh well it was hella worth it!! \m/ they made a good team! i Love how Zakk shreds from Sweat Leaf to War Pigs it insane!!!\m/ Ozzy Osbourne- VocalsZakk Wylde- GuitarRandy Castillo- DrumsGeezer Butler- Bass"
2,What a Disappointment,"My son loves this mattress, and has always slept well. It meets all the safety requirements, which was our primary consideration when buying it. However, my son is 10 months old, and has slept on the mattress for only 9 months, and it is already coming apart! There are wear holes in one of the corners--right through the vinyl! Let me just state that the mattress doesn't receive any rough treatment; our son just sleeps on it. We were planning on him sleeping on it until he outgrew his toddler bed. There is no reason why a company such as Simmons should have a mattress that is so flimsy. I currently have a claim in to Simmons' warranty department, so hopefully they do something about this."
1,Bad delivery,We received 2 seperate mattresses that were both damaged.We finally gave up and went to the store to buy 1.Very bad service.
3,This book not edited,"This is a short tract, but very interesting. The problem is that whoever scanned it did no editing whatsoever. There are loads of errors. The errors are not just wrong words, they are words with garbage in them. It doesn't appear that there was even an attempt at editing. This is amazing since the book is so short - only about 7 pages. This product is certainly not worth the 99 cents. Get it from a different source - Kindle should proof what they sell and at least exclude product like this."
3,short but sweet,"This little pamphlet is well written but is literally only 7 full pages long. The info above had said 48 pages. At first I thought that it was some sort of printing mistake because there are several blank pages. Which that still could be the case i'm not totally sure. Really no way of finding out either. Seeing I don't know anyone who has this perticular book. Oh, well. It was still good material, even as short as it was!"
1,Worst Movie I have ever seen!,"This movie is not one you will want to see. You can see it because you want to see how stupid it is, but not because you want to be satisfied. The effects are horrible. When the shark eats Samuel L Jackson, it is the fakest thing i have ever seen, period. LL Cool J lights a lighter, and throws it, when he throws it the flame doesnt go out, and it hits the WATER and explodes in a huge explosion? WTF? The sharks look very fake, and you will be wondering why the people are so stupid. When the sharks eat the people it is cool, but very fake and anticlimatic"
1,I had to select 1 star...but it would be 5 minus!,WHAT A CRAP! PREDICTABLE...DULL...HILARIOUS.. WHAT A STUPID FILM...I really laughed a lot when saw it...unbelievable sucha a bad film like this could even be rated with one star!
1,Laughable....if that.,"Hollywood must think we're all mindless to put this kind of trash out there. Even when suspending ALL belief this movie is horrible. How is it that a 45 foot shark that is a good 8 feet round (at least) in the middle can fit through a hatch just big enough to fit a human through? And how is it that said shark can also swim freely in chest deep water and yet still have room to jump like a dolphin, straight up out of it to eat a parrot? And didn't anyone else find it strange that these sharks who could apply ""about 8 tons"" of force to open a 4 inch thick steel hatch would have a problem breaking an oven window? C'mon! This movie was an insult to all of us. The CGI was terrible, the acting was horrible (except LL), the script was horrendous and continuity was not even present. Save your money and a bit of dignity, rent it before you buy....that's all I can say."
5,unbelievably awesome,"i loved this movie. i have never seen jaws, but this is probably as good. i first saw it in the theater and have never in my entire life been on the edge of my seat more. once it gets going it is one very long action scene that never lets up to let you catch your breath. it is great."
5,Lunch Time.,"If you liked the 1975 thriller Jaws, you're gonna love this. Deep Blue Sea is a wonderful film, the sharks look terrific, the acting is very good, and suspense moves quickly along with the intense action sequences. I recommend it to anyone who wants an amazing shark movie, or for somebody who enjoys being spooked and surprised."
4,Very enjoyable with twists!,"I thought this was going to be really cheesy, but it was not that bad. It was a lot of fun to watch. If you are a fan of these types of movies then you must check it out."
4,Great Video and Audio Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who have done this.The video quality is great, although I did not see it as perfect. I would give it a 9.7 on a 10 point scale. Audio, which was DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, was great also. Lots of surround sound and sub-woofer bass.The movie was pretty good, not great."
2,Not worth the effort,"This film is not brilliant, It's not well written and the acting is ok. It has a few exciting moment's but that's about it. To be honest I was glad it was a present and I didn't pay for it. It has some mindless shark attack excitiment which can be ok, but it's not the best film in the world, at all."
3,Not quite Jaws but still a good shark movie,"Deep Blue Sea is a decent shark movie. The acting is fair but nothing special. The appearance of Samuel L. Jackson is fun. The sharks look pretty good. The script itself centers around the fact that these sharks are being genetically altered in order to do some pharmaceutical research. As with all man-toys-with-nature movies, things go haywire and catastrophe strikes. L.L. Cool J plays the cook onboard the shark research station in the middle of the ocean. His character is likable and adds some good comedic lines to the script. Definitely not an Oscar quality film, but a decent action flick for the shark fan to watch. The only shark movies better than this are the first two Jaws films. If you're a shark fan, definitely give it a watch. If you're an action fan, probably give it a watch. If you're not into action or sharks, there's nothing else here to enjoy."
4,What if Jaws went to college,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I first thought, not forme. Then one day in the video store there was nothing in except forDeep Blue Sea. So I said what the hell. To my suprise the movie was pretty darn good. The story is completely different from Jaws, special effects were tight, sound FX smooth. Best of all the people who survive the calacalysmic night are the ones who deserved it. The DVD is complete with a documentary, deleted scenes and great sound and picture. A good addition to horror collections. END"
3,Could be better!,"When me and my brother rented this movie we where really exited(because our friends gave it so good recomendations)When we finaly started the movie i promised myself not to hold my hands infront of my eyes,but i thought whatdahell the movie hasen't even started yet,what am i so afraid of.But when we pressed the play button and the dvd menu was coming up i got so scared because there was a camera who dived under water,and a huge shark came up and ote the whole camera.That laides and gentlemen is the only scaring scene in this movie,the computer effects are laughable and i give this movie 3 and a half stars."
2,idiotic garbage,"Good special effects and sound effects, but absurd plot. Another movie that exploits sharks as evil killing machines. Many absurdities such as sharks being fooled by red wine in the water (thinking its blood)."
1,The Sharks Weren't Smart...The People Were Stupid,"This movie is probably one of the worst movies of the 1990s. It's depressing because the only good actor in the movie gets killed off...I guess sharks are attracted to good actors...they have good taste.Everyone in this movie is so stupid that its attempts at being serious makes your stomach turn. The girl gets killed because she jumps into the ocean with blood on her hands, and can't get out. How dumb can you possibly get? The sharks weren't smart at all; the people were too stupid to outwit a shark. The sharks didn't follow the people; they just followed the water.It's kind of ironic because they're looking for a cure of Alzheimer's, but it seems they have forgotten about their common sense. God, how awful.I don't know if you noticed, but a movie isn't terrifying if the people in the movie do stupid stuff to get into a ""scary"" situation. The Exorcist is a scary movie, not this. This is like Jaws and The Real World put together."
5,Deep Blue Sea,"In her efforts to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Susan McAlester implants human brain tissue into sharks. The experiment backfires, producing a horrifying species of killer sharks with the capacity to think like humans. This movie has action, suspense, horror and serious gore. The visuals are amazing and the movie was only made in 1999. A superb movie, it's not Jaws even better."
1,Just Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.,"I was kind of disappointed in the film. It was Ok, but it needed more better graphic shark attacks and better acting if you ask me. Spilberg's JAWS was way better that Deep Blue Sea. Why bothing going through the trouble making another horrible film? All it's about is these three sharks that these scientist reseachers are studying on to make them get ""smarter."" Suddenly, the sharks escape and start terrorizing the people. If you ask me, don't bother seeing this movie. If you want to see a shark movie, diffinatly see JAWS."
4,FUN,"If you're looking for an intelligent thriller then you've come to the wrong place, but if you want to see an action packed edge of your seat movie then check out DEEP BLUE SEA. What impressed me the most was that the action starts up right away (about 15 min into the film) and doesn't stop until the end. Many people are comparing this movie to JAWS, but far from it. This film is more along the lines of the POSEIDON ADVENTURE. Worth watching."
1,Quite awful,"I spent most of this film in a state of total disbelief, feeling I had blundered into an old set for the Poseidon Adventure . What on earth were the Aquatica sharks made of? They gleamed like lovingly polished Ferraris in a car show room, and on occasion moved as if the controls had seized and stuck on fast forward. The cer-unch ce-runch of the manequins being eaten...the shot of the shark in the last reel...; seriously bad. ""Jaws"" doesn't have a thing to worry about.Best line: ""You ate mah bird""."
1,Barely tolerable,"I don't know how I got drawn into watching this movie, but I actually watched the entire thing. I guess it comes from being a big ""Jaws"" fan. This is basically an idiotic movie. L.L. Cool J. steals the show. Without him, this movie would not have even been tolerable to watch."
1,Not Good,"I really didn't care much for Deep Blue Sea.I've read a lot of reviews comparing it to Jaws.I won't.Even if there had never been a Jaws this would be a bad movie.I thought the acting was bad,the sharks looked bad,(the CGI ones,anyway)and director Renny Harlin has done much better.(i.e. Cliffhanger,Die Hard 2,The Long Kiss Goodnight)I think Samuel L.Jackson is a great actor,but his talent is wasted here.Saffron Burrows looks good,but her performance wasn't too great.That's about all,as there really aren't a lot of good things I can say about this movie.Of course,this is all just my own personal opinion,if you like the movie,great,but there are just so many better movies out there-so why bother with this one!"
1,Puhleeze!,The only upside to this movie would have been the special effects - but take the usual thin hollywood script and ad tired effects and even sharks seem boring@!
3,shark attacks galore,"this one has great shark attacks with bloody efects afterwards, but its slowed down with some rampid stupidity in the dialouge and some dry parts, but never quit the good cast. Thomas Jane, LL Cool J, Saffron Burrows, Stellan Skarsgard, Jaqueline McKenzie, Samuel L. Jackson and Michel Rapaport and its fun to see LL Cool J as a priest, though I hated seeing Jackson die in the middle"
5,The greatest movie I've ever seen in all time history!,"This movie was the best I've ever seen and I'd really love to see it again and again and again!!! This movie has suspense that can blow your mind away!! This movie is way better than all the Jaws movies put together. If I have to pick one movie to see everyday this would be it! All I can say is, if you havn't this, you havn't seen anything yet!"
1,No Show,This item was never received. Amazon's tracking system claims that it was shipped on January 20 by Canada Post.
2,Boo.,"Booo, hisss, I feel cheated. I watched this film on the promise that LL Cool J would get eaten. The film then double crosses me and he survives.Anyway, sharks with big brains....nuff said really"
2,i REALLY didn't like this...,"My mother and i watched this movie last night. From all the reviews, i thought it would be interesting, and a halfway decent action movie. umm...no. the computer effects of the sharks are halfway decent, but the computer-generated people look more like bad video game character characters than people. the characters had almost no depth to them, making me not care whether they lived or died. we watched the deleted scenes at the end of the dvd, and if they had been left in, the characters might have actually had an impact, rather than just be shark food. the director, in his commentary, kept saying that they took things out to keep the pace up. i would rather have learned a little more about the characters. however, i did think ll cool j was very good, and he made it funny."
3,"scary,I think not!","I think this movie is pretty cool for the special effects,but still,why does horror flicks have awful plots.There is only one line in this movie that you need to know is=WATCH OUT.THE SHARKS WILL BITE YOUR HEAD OFF.Still the actors need to know is that the sharks will swim around until it bites you in the a**"
1,Deep Blue Sea,"As one of the biggest Jaws fans around, I had hoped for another interesting movie about sharks. Unfortunately, this is neither. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Poor story, poor acting and even poor special effects. The effects are better on video games. I am surprised Samuel L. Jackson would aggree to this. Stay far away from this one, you are safer in the water!"
1,Wake me when it's over.,"I really wanted to like this movie, But I couldn't bring myself to say anything positive about the movie.The acting the direction and the computerized sharks had me reaching for the remote. I am a huge fan of Jaws and I know it is really unfair to compare the two films, But I'll take the rubber shark over BAD CGI any day of the week. The disc on the other hand is loaded with extras and looks and sounds great. So I give the Film 1 star and the Dvd 4 stars. If I were you i'd spare yourself the agony of watching the film and wait for Jaws to be released in July. You'll be a lot happier."
1,Yoouuwwch!!!,"This movie BITES!Borrowing liberally(who knows why) from the lame Jaws III, Deep Blue Sea is a shark attack movie that takes place below the sea in a research station instead of at the shallow end of the beach. But instead of a claustrophobic Alien type movie, we're given a non-sensical, hackneyed plot, overly familiar characters and digitally computer enhanced mayhem. Sharks are a personal terror of mine, and like a car wreck you can't help but glance at, I have to see all of the shark movies that come out. So when I can almost fall asleep during a film about one of my worst nightmares you know that the picture is a real snore. Even one of my top 10 favorite actors, Samuel Jackson, can't help this movie from becoming chum(look it up).Avoid this film like you would...well, shark infested waters!"
4,Not bad for a shark movie,"I hear lots of people talking about how Jaws was a tremendous movie full of suspense, and Deep Blue Sea was a movie focused mainly on people being torn to bloody chunks with no surprises. The latter is fairly true, but it was still better than Jaws. The first time I saw Jaws, I didn't flinch, and when I finally saw the shark, I almost scoffed out loud at how incredibly fake it looked! You could practically see the gears working inside its mouth. Then I saw Deep Blue Sea, which at least made me grip my armrests a bit tighter. There were at least two scenes in there, punctuated by scary high-pitched music and screams, a la The Shining, in which everyone in the theater gasped sharply. I have seen it twice more after that, and plan to see it again. Jaws, however, wasn't quite good enough for that."
2,"Jaws wannabe, chessy special effects, but the dvd is good!","This movie is a Jaws wannabe,taking place at place studying sharks to save human lifes. There is big storm(Hello Jurassic Park? ) and the people at the facilty are stranded for the weekend.While there they do some exeperiments with the sharsk and tragic results. The humans start being hered where the smart sharks want them to go. In the end there is onr two surivors,Thomas Jane(shark wrangler) and LL Cool J(Toys) as the cook! The DVD has more features than the usual Waner bros stuff , so if you buy this dvd be sure to take advantage of the DVD, for the price they want here it 's a bargain!"
2,WAY OVER-RATED!,"This movie was not action packed like it says. It is about some sharks that all of a sudden get ""smart"". I dont know if it seemed to short or to long but they atmosphere never changes. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the actors and it showed alot of graphic material. I would not reccommend buying this movie."
2,Deep Boo Sea,"Deep Blue Sea is the latest string of high-tech effects and no story films. These computer genetrated effects are so ""cheesey"" they're not believeable. Super intelligent sharks that seek out they're human creators. I've heard and seen that same plot over and over. I hated the actors so much, I fast forward to scenes where people got gobbled by the toothy intellectual sharks."
3,Can We Fire The MPAA?,"""Sharks in the water! Sharks in the water!""That pretty much sums it up. On the plus side there is a distinct lack of nudity despite there being many scenes where nudity could have been included, which ensures I don't feel guilty when I put in on for my son who's on his shark movie kick.The worst language in the movie is exchanged between the chef & his bird -- and the graphic violence isn't terribly graphic despite being rather violent.A few issues with continuity, but it beats the hell out of listening to kids movies in the background."
4,Interesting and well-pacaed action movie/cover format is neat,"""Deep Blue Sea"" has been an interesting and well-paced action movie ever since it was released theatrically and then onto DVD. Like ""Maverick"", the DVD cover format (keepcase) is neat and more practical than the traditional format, and the price is very reasonable."
3,"really boring through the first half hour,but it gets better","fast forward through the first half hour.i fell asleep through that.but it got really,really better.see this if you liked jaws, or lake placid"
2,Not even close to Jaws,"Although I can appreciate the technical achievements of this film, it is not even as good as Jaws 2, let alone the original. The suspense is obvious and the sharks themselves, although really fast and furious seem fake. At no time did I feel that these were real sharks. In Jaws, the clever use of the mechanical shark and actual shark footage was far more effective. Also, everything that happened was fairly predictable. If you just want to vegetate for a few hours, this movie does the trick, but its nothing special."
3,Deep Blue Sea,Fairly entertaining but a poor Jaws wanna be. The sharks did not seem real and too many characters died. LL Cool J did the best job of acting and turned out to be the only character I really cared about.
5,This Movie Kicks Jaws in the Gullet,"NEVER, EVER have i jumped so much in a film. From start to finnish this kepps you on the edge of your seat. Everyone who you would put money on surviving dies! I was particularly suprised to see Samuel Jackson bite the dust so early in the film as he was the only famous actor. If you were disappointed with films like Scream because you weren't scared, I guarantee this will give you night mares for a good few days. AMAZING!"
4,"for this kind of movie, that is.","Somewhere out at sea Nameless Giant Corporation sponsors a vast shark pen & multistory underwater research center. Here a team of scientists is working to increase the intelligence of sharks in order to cure Alzheimer's syndrome. No, of course that doesn't make sense, the concept is irrelevant. This is a good-looking, entertaining movie that is one of the better entries in the ""summer no-brainer"" category. The acting may not be on a par with Shakespeare in Love or something, but it's not bad. So settle back and relax. There's trouble at the shark station, and Samuel L. Jackson is flying in from Head Office to investigate...."
2,Shallow Blue Sea,"Scientists looking for a cure for Alzheimer's disease experiment with nature's most dangerous predator, the shark, making them smarter. Unfortunately, they're now only as smart as the scientists themselves, who seem to be suffering from the disease they're trying to prevent."
4,"""JAWS"" ON STEROIDS!","I enjoyed this shocking shark thriller. A surprise at every turn, absolutely the worse nightmare come true for an unfortunate group of researchers. Shocking and gripping without relying on gratuitous sex or profanity. Overall quite well done, including the astonishing special effects. Thumbs up for Renny Harlin!"
4,Deep Blue Sea,In enjoyed this movie but I bought it as a gift for my daughter and grand-daughter. They liked it so much that they wanted it in their collection of movies.
3,Deep Blue Sea,"Excellent action and startling surpises....the sharks are monsters and create a lot of anxiety. A few good characters like LL Cool J as the cook. This is good, light entertainment."
4,Deep Blue Sea Rocked My Boat,"I had wanted to see this movie since summer but never got the chance. Watching it on DVD though made up for it. The sound to this movie was incredible. At times we felt we were really there in Aquatica. The scenes were suspenseful and unpredictable. One scene though was taken right out of the opening of Cliffhanger, but still seemed to work. Until the very end I did not know who was gonna make it out alive. For the most part the sharks seemed pretty realistic, but there were a few scenes where they looked mechanical. I have seen better quality deleted scenes on DVD before, but the documentaries and commentaries were very good. A great film to watch with friends who get on edge very quickly. I was elbowed three times by the girl sitting next to me from being startled. A great addition to my collection."
3,Overated,This movie started off extremely slow and the special effects weren't that great. There were a couple of times where the sharks actually looked like cartoons. LL Cool J added the much needed comic relief after phony shark attacks. And it was totally unbelievable at the end when the only two surviors were laughing and joking after killing the last shark.
2,A typical action movie.,"Deep Blue Sea was a disappointing movie on the whole. It must have had a substantial budget, but that didn't completely help in my opinion. The cinematography was very good but that's really the only positive thing I can say about this film. There didn't seem to be much character development either and the movie just turned into a typical action flick that was too long and should have ended earlier. The acting by all wasn't a problem though and was okay. The shark action didn't look natural of course and their movements were too choppy and not very believable. Deep Blue Sea seemed to come off as very glossy, but still lacking in substance. The concept at the beginning dealing with using the sharks to cure a disease was interesting, but that was all forgotten when the movie shifted into action mode. Deep Blue Sea wasn't completely poor, but it's a movie that could have been better. Disappointing."
2,IT DROWNED,"I personally have nothing against murderous super-sharks, but this offering was rather poor. This movie did not deliver on any genre. As a horror, it was not scary, as a thriller it was too predictable, as a comedy it was not funny, and as a drama it was simply ludicrous. I was surprised when the chef got away the first time, but this essentially meant he would make it to the end, which eliminated any future thought of a twist.On a positive note, I did quite like the soundtrack. I would say that was the best aspect of the movie. ... I was impressed by the way they explained away the non-sensical attack of the sharks, even though it made little more sense than the rest of the movie, it gave an original reason.Overall, this movie is not one for a second viewing, and the only excuse for any who hasn't seen it yet to watch it would be extreme boredom combined with morbid curiousity."
3,NO COMPROMISES - It's just funny and brainless,"Watch this movie without prejudice and taking in consideration that is not a artistic movie, and you'll have a good time."
5,GREAT,SHARKS AND DINOSAURS ARE MY THING AND THIS IS THE BEST SHARK MOVIE I HAVE. I HAVE WATCHED IT AT OVER AND OVER AND OVER. MAKES JAWS 1-4 LOOK LIKE GUPPY MOVIES.
4,Corny creature flicks. Take 'em for what they are worth.,"While many of the special effects in this film are cheesy and unrealistic, it is a great movie. I love these types of creature flicks. Don't watch this movie expecting to see Jaws because nothing could live up to the horror and suspense of Jaws. This movie is more like Anaconda with sharks; poor special effects, good plot, and lots of laughs. Plus the DVD has lots of cool extras."
2,Not your best shark movie ever,"Genetically engineered sharks make a meal to go out of their keepers.This movie even has the skinny English actress star disrobe to shock a shark. I suppose some people like this kind of movie,but actually drug companies are more into killing chimps thansharks. Anyway every body thinks they may have been paying forbad experimental science. As far as I know very few scientificprojects get out of hand like thisand the ones that do are government ones and they are covered up good?Drug companies are more into frog skins, tree bark and native herbs,than genetically engineering the sea equivalent totigers."
2,NOT BETTER THAN JAWS!,THE SPECIAL EFFECTS BLOW.THE SHARKS LOOK FAKE.I GAVE IT 2 STARS BECAUSE THERE'S ACTION AND BLOOD.THE IDEA OF THE SHARKS BEING CAPTIVE IN A LAB LIKE IS INTERESTING TO ALL.ALL AROUND DON'T BUY IT JUST RENT IT.
1,"Horrible, Grusome, And the sharks look too digital.","I think this movie was trying be sort of a jaws. They failed! Its about a group of experyts trying too help humans by curing Alzheymers disease with a cell form sharks. They accidentally made sharks smart. It is a total blowout with people getting arm bit off, heads bitten off, and one girl is eaten like a patato chip at the end."
2,Jaws?,"This movie tries to out-do the classic suspense of Jaws, but fails in bringing real tension to the screen. You can only watch people getting ripped to shreads by mechanical looking sharks for so long before it becomes repetitive. So much for restraint. Watching this, I found myself rooting for the sharks, because even though mechanical, they had much more personality than the human characters."
5,These sharks could blow Jaws outta the water,"At first, I was looking more forward to see Lake Placid, butthis turned out to be much better. The sharks looked great. Surprises everywhere! Just when you think you know what is gonna happen and who is going to make it and who won't, they turn the tables. Jaws was nothing but an overgrown great white who was a maneater. These sharks are genetically altered by humans. It gives a better depth of their intelligence. And unlike Jurrasic Park, it goes even deeper into what can go wrong when you screw around with nature."
2,smart sharks?,"ok this movie looked cool at first, but don't be fool by the snazzy cover. It is kinda neat at first, but c'mon hollywood, think of something productive instead of GENETICALLY ENGINARED SHARKS CAUSE CHAIN REACTION A UTTERLY DESTROY A DEEP SEA REASHERCH CENTER. If you think this could make Jaws eat his heart out, then you might as well vomit up your stomach like a hammerhead shark."
5,Deep Blue Sea,"This movie is really cool. Its not like Lake Placid, this has giant supersmart maco sharks eating and chasing people. The movie has LL cool J which makes the movie really funny. Buy it and you will have fun for months with this movie."
4,"Bigger, faster, Smarter!",Deep Blue Sea is the best shark film ever made. It didn't give you the ... Jaws did with not showing the shark. Deep Blue Sea always showed the sharks. It is a movie were you don't know who will be alive at the end. I like the idea of making the sharks smarter. Most of the main charactors got eaten. It had lots of action and blood. It was not a horror film. I hate horror films. This is an action film. It had a clean 2.35.1 anamorphic Widscreen. The film was Super 35 so its 2.35.1 is not the whole picture in some scenes. Plus most of deleted scenes should not have been deleted. Plus the film has lots of good supplements. A big problem was that it comes in a snapper case. I hate snappers. If like good action films Deep blue sea is for you.
2,Deep Blow Sea,"The two stars are for the DVD. This DVD looks good, sounds great and comes with some cool extras. The DVD is flawed in one area....the movie it comes with.The movie is an utter bore fest. Nothing to look foward to besides CGI sharks, if that tickles your fancy then your in for a treat, but if you enjoy good acting, sespence, action, horror, directing, and script you should most look eleswhere. I didn't care for one single person in this movie. They deserved it. The surprise death in the movie didn't fool me....I saw it coming, like I said Boring.The direction has been done better else where. The tension is just lost when I see an lame and crappy CGI shark coming at someone....eat them, who cares. I will give this to them the death animation when the shark rip apart someone are perrty cool, but that is all to look forward to in this otherwise borring movie."
1,An insult to anyone with any intelligence,Shame on Samuel Jackson for acting in such a cheese festival. I thought that he had more class. Enough with the digital special effects-these were not even in the slightest bit realistic. The acting was so poor that it often became hilarious. The fake looking sharks took the cake though. Don't waste your time. Get Jaws. I wish I could have given this utter piece of trash NO STARS!
2,"Mindless Fun, loaded with digital effects.","This silly movie resembles a spoof of Spielberg's classic JAWS. There is also a touch of POSIDON ADVENTURE and LEVITHAN included in the plot.It's mindless fun if you have 100 minutes to waste and don't expect too much. Fans of cool new digetal effects(sometimes obvious) will also enjoy this film. The DVD edition looks great. With fine, sharp colors on a wide screen image. A very listenable commentary by Samuel Jackson(often humerous) and director Renney Harlin, also short making of featurettes, trailer and still photo file are included. Quite a lot of extras for a dumb flick. DEEP BLUE SEA may be worth a rental, but only true fans will want the DVD."
3,Entertaining...,"...though the special effects (the data-animation of the sharks) could have been better at certain ""events"" of the movie. The acting is ok, the story (unrealistic of course) is rather exiting, the plot really works -and all in all the movie is absolutely recommended if you are able to watch a modern ""Jaws"", and see a little between the fingers. Far from a classic, but watchable!(The sharks are rather impressive too where the ""real ones"" are used, they look fast and dangerous -and the movie works this way as rather ""creepy"" now and then, some highlights of the movie are a bit predictable perhaps, but they work for sure. The best shark-movie since ""Jaws"", but not as remembarable)."
2,"Definitely mindless, but",fun if you're after a film you can goof on while you're watching it. It's interesting to watch the body count rise while those in the cast who can't act get worse and those who can (especially Sam Jackson)look increasingly embarassed.So bad it's almost watchable.
2,Makes me yearn for Jaws and Jaws 2.,"Deep Blue Sea is an example of cinematic overkill. Trying to pack three killer sharks with a lot of non-stop action in a confined setting isn't the way to make this sort of film. Steven Spielberg did it almost flawlessly in Jaws, a brilliant film that featured incredible acting, exciting action, and fine special effects. Deep Blue Sea has serviceable acting at best, yawn-inducing action, and CGI effects that are so fake I thought I was watching a video game. To see how to get this sort of film done right, check out Jaws and its first sequel. Oh, and Thomas Jane, you're no Roy Scheider."
2,Too bad the shark hadn't eaten the writer!,"Is it possible to make a movie with helicopter crashes, massive explosions and SUV sized sharks chomping people into snausages and have it be boring? ""Deep Blue Sea"" answers that question with a resounding ""YES!"" Harlin does his best to inject some oomph into the movie but I found myself not being too concerned with the fates of the characters with the exception of LL Cool J. Several times during this DVD I found myself saying out loud: ""If you kill LL I will turn this DVD off"" as there would be no other reason left to watch. Don't get me wrong: this movie looks good, the effects are good and the acting is competent. I just didn't care about what happened."
4,"Move over Jaws,the big fish is in town","A great thriller movie.Its full of surprises from the beginning. You find yourself watching going""OK he's going to live,she's going to...nope scratch that,OK shes gonna get....""You don't know whats around the next turn as sharks enter the sinking science lab,and it becomes a battle of wits when super smart sharks go up against there creators."
4,"Good movie, Great DVD (especially for this price)","Just live every other movie, some people like the movie and some don't. I personally enjoyed it. It made me just a few times, worry about the characters, and feel good at the end. That is all I wanted from it, and that is all I got. The DVD version of the movie is excellent. Aside from the great video and audio quality, we get a commentary (includes Samuel L. Jackson for part of it), 2 short making-of specials, deleted scenes, photo stills, and some extra DVD-ROM content. At the price it is being offered at, it is well worth getting this movie. If you're not sure you'll like it, rent it first."
3,Fins have come a long way since Jaws,"If you want a popcorn movie to share with a few friends this isfor you. Usual story of woman creates miracle cure, fish get annoyed,fish take revenge and annoyingly deficient sub-sea architecture. Some nice jumpy bits (can you feel them coming?), some great humour (see how many film homages you can spot) and the effects are OK (the non-CGI ones are better). People being outsmarted by fish? Happens every day but at least now I understand why LL Cool J has 'Cool' as his middle name."
3,Purely mindless - but is that a bad thing?,"I really tried to like this movie. I didn't hate it, just didn't like it. The audio and video quality were quite good, and the extra's were very well done. I really love deleted scenes when they are accompanied by a director's commentary.As seems to be the norm with Warner Brothers Special Editions, the menus take a little getting used to. In order to get to the special features, you first have to go to the ""Special Features"" sub-menu, and then click on the ""Decompression Chamber"" to get to the actual features.LL Cool J impressed me, and Saffron Burrows and Samuel Jackson have definitely had better roles. I think that there was a plot in there somewhere, but I wasn't interested in watching that deep to find it. But is that a bad thing? I didn't watch Deep Blue Sea in the hopes of finding Lawrence of Arabia under the ocean.Pure mindless entertainment without a purpose."
4,"These sharks kick, bite and kill !","This is, by far, the most entertaining movie I've seen this year. I've waited months to see this movie and went with high expectations getting just what I wanted: a thrill-packed action movie. The movie doesn't have much of a plot, but if it keeps you on the edge of your seat for two hours... forget about the plot, it's non-stop fun what matters. You don't have to be an action fan to enjoy this non-stop rollercoaster (if you're not at least you'll get to see a very, and I mean very, beautiful woman strip down to her bikini). Rent it, enjoy it and buy it."
4,Suprisingly good!,"This is a Sci-fi horror action thriller about a research center in midocean, a team of scientist researchers ( Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Thomas Jane, Saffon Burrows, Michael Rappaport and Aida Tutturo"") have conducted an experiment. An experiment that makes Sharks into super intetelligent beasts that start to turn the facility into a watery nightmare.Good special effects, good acting, and intense gore with heart-pumping action makes this worth watching.Also recommended: Resident Evil, Jaws, Eight Legged Freaks, Return of the Living Dead 3, Re-Animator, Deepstar Six, Leviethan, Frankenstein, The Fly ( 1986), The Hulk, Scanners, The Thing ( 1982), Link, Starship Troopers, Aliens, Total Recall, Day of the Dead, Lake Placid, Pirahna, and From Dusk Till Dawn."
3,Biting,"A good movie, keeps you interested ALL the way through. Worth adding to your collection. It is not jaws, but by no means a slacker."
2,Unreal,"Ill admit this movie isnt the worst I've seen. But this was so unreal its not even funny. Everyone I know told me to see this movie, they said it was so cool. So I did, I ended up laughing at most it. Most of deaths were pretty cheesey looking (pixelated). And no matter how smart a shark may be, they will never be able to swim backwards. however LL cool J is entertaining. A rental at most or buy it used."
1,Gag!,"This movie is soooo not worth seeing! It is not the least bit scary, the JAWS movies were WAY better than this! If your smart you won't waste your money on this!"
1,Deep Blue Sea ... BITES!,"Deep Blue Sea was a very disappointing film to watch, and came way short of being entertaining. First of all and most importantly, the sharks in this movie look way too computer animated, just like Anaconda's reptile, to be thought of as real. The sharks may try to be smart, but they sure looked dumb. The characters are not all that interesting either, except for Samuel Jackson small time on screen. LL Cool J needs to start taking more acting lessons and less beauty pagent, wannabee lessons. At times I thought I was watching one of those cheesy B-films on Showtime. This movie made me sea sick for all the wrong reasons! Jaws is still the king, and has nothing to worry about."
1,A Yawner!,this film is a bad 2nd rate reject of JAWS.as Great as Samuel L. Jackson is he can't save this mess.neither can LL.COOL J.this is good for putting yourself asleep to.
4,glad it`s winter here in Denmark!,Im vevry glad it`s winter time here in Denmark so i cant be forcede to jump in the ocean beacurse after seeing this movie i realizede that i did the exact same thing as steven spilberg`s movie Jaws.. it`s a thrilling ride down in to the deep blue sea any one who likes a good scare should defently buy this movie the effects done in this movie is stauning u never know whether it`s a real shark or a dummy either way i even wouldent take a swim with one of the dummys they are scarry vevry scarry.. anyway if u like thrilling and scarry movies u should bye this one today
5,Great Movie!,This is a great movie.I think LL Cool J was the best actor in the movie.I really liked how LL could make some scenes funny-like with his bird. The scientist woman(don't remember name)was so stupid-Why would any sane person give knowledge to something that was big enough to eat them? I do love the movie anyway.I think a lot of people would enjoy this movie!
2,Embarrassed to be a Finn,"I've seen a some RH films before and counted on him being a Finn doing a good job on this one. However, this was a disappointment. The plot is just so made-up and unbelievable as well as the special effects that this is a mere insult to watch. Keep your money and buy something else."
1,000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 FOR DEEP,PATHITIC INSCNIFIACANT STUPID UN RADECAL GOOD FOR NOTHING MOVIE EVER MADE.BURN IT STOMP ON IT THROW IT AWAY PLEASE.ID RATHER WATH BARNEY AND BE HAPPY THAN WATCH THIS.FAKE IS ALL THE MOVIE IS. POOR SAMUL. DOESENT DESERVE ONE STAR.
1,Reasons2 slag off Deep Blue Sea,"An over pretentious effort that looks as if it started with a rag bag of scary ingredients and mixed together in an ill-thought out rotten-pot. Generally an unbelievable story with a silly predictable plot. I found myself giggling at its telegraphed scenes and lines - ""lets guess when the shark appears next"" - ""ohh, there it is - what a surprise!!!"".Reasons2"
1,Terrible,I was appalled by how stupid this movie was like when the actors were diving into the water with the sharks only a few metres away. I mean that's just asking to be killed! It was also a disgusting movie by showing the actors being ripped apart by the sharks. Worst movie ever.
4,It's FUN FUN FUN!,"Well, what else is there to say? This movie is made with that extra something. Harlin really knows how to make movies, that's for sure.."
4,Keeps you awake!,"I wasn't expecting alot out of this movie, so imagine my surprise when I watched it! There's no way you could drift off to sleep in this movie. I was on the edge of my seat through most of the movie! I even woke my poor dog at one point when I screamed out. If your interested in watching an eye opening movie than this is the one for you!"
2,Loaded with special effects and red water.,Some scientists are doing research on a floatng laboratory in the ocean. They turn regular sharks into highly intelligent monsters. The sharks are kept in 'secure' tanks. A storm comes. The sharks escape. The floating lab floods with water. The scientists are trapped with the escaped sharks. The sharks are very smart. The usual amount of blood and gore follows. Typical action movie. A cool documentary about sharks is included though.
4,Pretty cool movie overall,"The movie had great special effects and was fun to watch, but the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because all the lead characters in this movie got eaten by the sharks. It seemed like all the characters that you didn't expect to die, did, and all the characters you did expect to die, didn't. Really it isn't that bad but just kind of dissapointing. Like I said overall, this movie was pretty cool and I think it's just good scarry entertainment."
5,Deep Blue Sea is GREAT,"Well after i heard about another Shark movie I was almost not going to go see it. But I did and to my surprise it was a great if not one of the best Shark movies ever! Deep Blue Sea was not just about a shark killing a lot of people but, instead the scientists created the syrom or something the increased the brain size of the shark which then enabled it to be maybe 10 times as smart as any ordinary shark. I mean the sharks were swimming backwards. I would recomend this movie to anyone the first of all likes all of the old Jaws movies, and second for all of you people that like the real sci-fi stuff that makes you laugh. Thank you for your time and I hope that I have been helpful!"
4,Deep Blue Sea,"This is a Very Good Film. Great acting all round. Amazing Special effects. It makes jaws look like a yellow rubber duck floating in your bath. This is the first shark horror film I have ever seen. I have seen the Jaws films all of them, they are interesting but no cigar. This goes with on the shelf with the all time good horror, suspence and action films. Buy it."
3,Popcorn film,"This film is simply a good popcorn film. It's good if you feel like having some friends over and rooting for who dies next. It has a good amount of twists but even with its unorthodox character treatment (the two stars die) it has points where it drags and is redundant at times. Overall I don't think this is one you should buy, just rent it and have fun."
2,A rather retarded movie,"Pretty retarded. Purely class B, full of cheap thrills and no storyline, plot or character development. I'd get rid of it if I had the opportunity."
1,bitten in half,a dump fun mindless movie. people test sharks and they give them a pill that makesthem smart. then the mans arm is bitten off thats were it all begins.and the shark breaks a glass in the lab and water goes everywhere and we see who makes it to the top.animation sharks are what the really look like. samul l jackson dosent make it which you herd was a bad part it is. i would of not of expected it until one of my dads friends were talking about how bad it was and told me about what he said and the shark attack. and a girl told me it was stupid and told me about the arm part. fun to wath on a rainy day dome no good.stupid better than python and crocodile thats it.
3,"Way cooler than jaws, more trills, kills and sharks","The major star of this movie is Samual Jackson, who plays the new guy to the underwater lab (located 100s of miles offshore) where the sharks are advanced for their healing abilities. Eventually he notices that the sharks are getting too smart to remain under control of the scientists and handlers. Then the sharks get their chance to prove it during a topical storm, which disables everything in the lab, including their way of getting out and off of the lab. This is not a stereotypical Jaws movie, because it takes place all indoors or underwater, the special effects are sometimes gruesome, and the fact that now the sharks are smarter so they hunt the cast rather than randomly attacking. Not exactly the original Jaws, but more thrilling, and more technical knowledge about sharks. Plus tons of DVD features, this is what DVD is all about."
1,Missing Much,"The director's commentary on the DVD goes great leaps toward explaining what was intended in this movie. I do not feel that the characters were well developed. I did not feel sorry for them when attacked by the shark. Some of the deleted scens would have helped to understand the relationships between characters. The Computer Graphics were OK, but nothing stunning compared to movies of late. Basically, I feel that they should have tried harder. It could have been much more interesting."
2,This movie is fun....,"and really really low on intelligence. Hey, what do you expect? How can you be critical of any movie like this? It really makes you see how good the original Jaws is though. Special effects are never a replacement for bad acting. I imagine Samuel L. Jackson had some kind of debt to pay when he signed up for this one.LL Cool J = Box Office Poison."
3,Shallow Blue Sea but fun to watch,This is a fun movie. I really enjoyed watching it and the special effects are great. DVD definately brings out the best in the film.This is a great movie to watch when you aren't looking for anything too serious.Although I am dissapointed that they didn't put LL Cool J's video on the DVD aswell. In this digital age and with the extra options they put on DVD disks you'd think they would use it for a better interactive experience for the viewer.
4,Good for a Rainy Night,"Interesting computer graphics and likable characters, but, except for who gets to survive, the plot is pretty average horror. I'd watch it, but I will not keep it."
4,"""YOU ATE MY BIRD!""","I saw this movie a few years ago and I really enjoyed it.Aquatica is trying to find a cure for some desease from gentically altered Mako sharks. And guess what? The sharks break free wreak havoc.This movie is good because it is scary and suspenseful. LOADS of people die, which is cool. The only downside to it is the computer animated sharks. They don't look very real.Overall, a cool movie and great to watch!"
4,Just something about it,"I don't have a fondness for gore, or horror (these days), but this wasn't so bad. I know this movie won't win any awards for acting and plot, but I still think it's pretty decent. Whoever cast LL Cool J gave him the best lines in the film, which were most of the funny ones and he does a great job landing them. I like ocean movies and this one offers some really cool effects. In this, you can let go of reality for a while, maybe imagine yourself in a similar, seemingly no-win situation, feel the tension and the suspense. Of course they're not real sharks, but they're pretty good effects. At least in Deep Blue Sea, the ""typical"" isn't so typical. Those you may think will still be around by the end, aren't. Surprise!"
1,Most horrific things are the cheesy effects,"The effects killed this movie. It was a great idea for an escapist B-movie, and the build-up to each attack was serviceable - but the absolutely laughably ludicrous CGI effects made the sharks as non-scary as humanly imaginable. They killed the ""mood"" each time. Director Harlin erred when he decided to show full-length shark acrobatics and attacks. They came off as cheapo 3D cartoons with cheapo cartoon legs flailing in their mouths. Learn from the horror masters, Renny - Less is more! A few scale shark models, foaming red water, split-second closeups, and ominous music would have been better.Spotting the 'Jaws' and 'Alien' series homages ... was the only entertaining factor after a while. Well, that and Saffron Burrows' flawless face..."
4,"Solid Effort, But Minor Flaws...","At Vance is a band growing in popularity with each album recorded. ""The Evil In You"" is solid songwriting wise, but it lacks slightly with musicianship. No complaints can be found within the lyric writing context, it's certainly top-notch.However, some of the songs just seem to drag. Oliver Hartmann has been replaced by newcomer, Mats Leven who's singing style is similar, but just doesn't have the curious edge Oliver's did. Some of the drumming is good, but at times can be repetitious.Overall the album is a good one, and enters a new age for At Vance. As with all bands, they can only grow and get better. After all, they are playing Power Metal, and like sex, even when it's bad, it's good."
1,not what I expected,"If you are looking for a book that tells you anything about orangutans, this is not it. The information about Dayak culture is interesting, however, I was too distracted by the author's inadequate preparation for being outdoors, to really enjoy any of the information. The book claims to be about ""following"" Birute Galdikas, however, the author actually meets the woman only two times, both very brief, if memory serves me correctly. Check it out from a library, but it's not worth buying."
3,interessting book.,"In the begining of this book you get to follow a Canadian women in her obsesion of Birute. It feels like Linda has mist the whole idea of what is going on in the rainforest. She is way to impresst at Birute, insted of acctually focus on the problems the orangutans are suffering. Well, thats my first impression as an animal-lover. Later in the book Linda acctually starts improving and starts to see things with other eyes. She comes across to be a verry sweet women, maybe somewhat naive though. Well the book is good,it gives you a good insite on the life on the river around the Leakey-camp. It is defenetly worth reading it."
2,Gilkey Weed Book,"The weed book by Gilkey is very old, having been published in 1957. It is not nearly as well organized as the other book I purchased by other authors. I will probably donate it to Goodwill because it has little to offer the person who is trying to find a specific plant, not knowing the name of it. The drawings are excellent, but the organization is really poor, comparatively."
5,Nancy Drew in her own words,"Chelsea Cain's lighthearted, witty parody of the Nancy Drew series will appeal to all who spent blissful childhood hours curled up with the ""slim, attractive, titian-haired"" detective. Cain serves up the REAL Nancy Drew, as appealing in her own way as she was in the pages of Carolyn Keene ""who got a lot of things wrong.""All the familiar characters are here---Ned Nickerson (whom Nancy does marry); Bess (not really plump at all--indeed, slightly anorexic due to her anxiety over the way she is depicted by Keene); George (with a ""life partner""); Hannah Gruen (with a surprising secret); Carson Drew (with a svelte young wife). Many other figures from the pages of childhood mystery series appear--foremost among them, Nancy's love, Frank Hardy.Readers will find themselves chuckling over every page and experiencing delightful nostalgia mixed with wry, clear-eyed adult humor. You'll love this book!"
5,A Wonderful Trip Down Memory Lane,"I had heard nothing about this book until this weekend when I saw it in a bookstore while on vacation. Once I started I could not put it down! I read all of the Nancy Drew, Trixie Belden, Cherry Ames, and Vicki Barr books I could get my hands on when I was in elementary and middle school, and this book was like visiting old friends - but we were all older, wiser, and changed in different ways by the changing world.I didn't find this book to be depressing. I loved the central theme - it is dangerous to hang on to your ""glory days"" and to never grow beyond them. I suppose I found my own life's affirmation while reading of Nancy's struggles to be relevant in a world that had lost its need for Teen Sleuths."
3,A quick read,"This is a very quick read and is amusing sometimes and not so amusing in others. Sometimes the paroday is more a dose of reality than what I would consider for good parody. If you are a fan of Nancy Drew, I would say it is worth a read as it will amuse you more at the beginning than at the end. However, is it worth owning? No. It is more of a ""check it out of the library"" book."
2,Nancy Drew a blank,"As a childhood fan of teen detective series, I was really looking forward to this one. But clever as she is, the author runs into the same problem that has thwarted every other writer (and there have been several) who's attempted a book-length spoof of this genre: Namely, a little of this stuff goes a long, long way. Years ago the National Lampoon set the benchmark for this type of thing with a hilarious parody that ran just one short chapter. Mystery solved: Brevity is the soul of wit."
1,I would not recommend this book,"The word ""parody"" is not lost on me but I felt this book was in poor taste. If you are looking for a ""nice"" book that fills in some gaps in the Nancy Drew series in a fun way this is not the book for you. My copy is now in the trash."
2,C-,"The joke grows old and the writing wearisome about forty pages into the tongue-in-cheek prose of Chelsea Cain's Nancy Drew parody. It's a bit of a struggle getting through the sparse narration and even sparser descriptions. While the content and style of the book is a reflection on the original source material of Carolyn Keene's popular teen novels, Cain could have done much, much more. There are so many different ways this could have been handled, but Cain chose the easy way out and played up the dumb aspects while leaving the reader short on depth and substance. Aspects of Confessions of a Teen Sleuth are funny, but most of it is a dry bore. The character twists - George becoming a lesbian, Bess developing an eating disorder - are more amusing in thought than in actual delivery. Let's hope someone new takes the reigns of this parody and flushes it out more thoroughly sometime in the future, because Cain left a lot to be desired."
5,Clever girl,"""Confessions of a Teen Sleuth"" is the Nancy Drew book for adults who grew up reading (and loving) Nancy Drew, as I did. As a parody, it's smart and affectionate and just a great way to spend an afternoon--which actually is one of the best things a book can offer. I even bought my ten year-old niece her own copy, because she is so avid about N. Drew. Though she won't be able to fully appreciate the beauty of what Cain has pulled off here, I know she'll get a kick out of it later. Also, something should be said about Lia Miternique's illustrations which match the text's mix of humor and intelligence. And Cain's version of Encyclopedia Brown is unparalled."
2,Not as funny as I hoped,Written a little bit too ironically. I did enjoy the reference to Encyclopedia Brown. Fun for a quick read and perhaps for those who are more enmeshed in the ND world than I.
2,former Nancy Drew fan,"I was excited when I heard about this book on NPR. I was, however, disappointed when I got the chance to read it. I don't know what I expected but I thought it got very repetitive and a bit boring (i guess that is how the author felt about the originals)."
1,Don't order it,"I have tried so many times to get this thing to work and I'm so dissapointed because I was really excited about getting it for my son as he has had other cds that work perfectly. And as others have had the same problem, I recommend not waisting money on that product"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND AN ADDITIONAL $8/MONTH TO ACCESS FULL GAME!!,"Buyer beware - purchase of this game only allows you to access 2 of the 12 levels of the game. To access the full game, you must become a jumpstart member (for an additional cost of $8/month). From the moment the game starts, it talks about earning the 12 badges to unlock the mystery - so that by the time you complete the first two levels, your child is fully aware that there are other areas of the camp under construction that they have not accessed, and that they need to become ""members"". Unless you want to spend the money or deal with an extremely disappointed child, do not purchase!! My guess is that this is true with other Jumpstart products as well."
4,where should you purchase?,"I purchased this for a friends son for christmas, it states buy 'new and used' but from others not specifically amazon. I decided to save a few bucks and go with a 'new' from someone else. Well, it didn't come wrapped, it was open the case was marked and scratched. I was expecting a new item. this was not. won't be buying anything like that again.otherwise, all these CD's are great for children, mine love them."
3,Just okay,"This was just okay. My son didn't really like it and I was hoping for something that he'd really enjoy. It was a little too basic and nothing to ""reel him in,"" so to speak."
4,Good product,"My 3 year and 5 year old like the game, after reading all the review I chose this one,it teach them a lot."
3,Um micro-review em portugus,"Comprei este livro, como sempre fao com os livros de referncia de Star Trek que a Pocket Books lana. É um livro regular, nada de especial, formato pequeno, muito bem feitinho, mas que no traz realmente nada de novo. Algumas fotos foram até recicladas de outros livros. Se voc, f brasileiro ou portugus, quiser comprar algo que realmente valha a pena, compre o ""Art of Star Trek"", edio hardcover."
5,Love it!,"This album holds a fantastic collection of music. The song ""Childhood"" by Michael Jackson is touching, and it's not the only one on here that is."
1,Terrible,"Very simply, this board does not have any stringers; carbon rods paralleling a board down the center. It gives strength to the board, something this board doesn't have. I bent and broke mine within a week with 5' waves. Not for a semi-serious boarder. Spend the extra money to get a board with stringers."
4,A dictionary one could read from beginning to end...,"The Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms is a must for theology students and clergy. Donald McKim gives brief and informative definitions of many widely-used theological terms employed across many faiths. Accompanying many words are brief etymologies (VERY brief in most cases) which help the student to see behind the meanings of some of the words. This book is not bulky and can fit into a briefcase or backpack no problem. It is the best theological dictionary I've purchased yet. Honestly, I use mine every day, and sometimes even read it for pleasure.The only real complaint I have about the book is that it contains mostly Christian terminologies. Perhaps this may be good for those of the Christian faith, but for those studying a broad range of religions, this book may not help too much (the assumption here is that ""theology"" is much more than just Christianity). All in all, it is a great addition to your library and I recommend it."
4,Great quick guide,"This book is terse, pithy and suscint. It offers a plain english definition for complex and confusing terms. A great guide to use regularly."
1,What a disappointment!,"Having seen several claymation specials when they originally aired on TV, I ordered this to show to my grandchildren.My first viewing was a shock, as the first eight and a half minutes are ""commercials"" for other products, several of which are not family friendly and definitely not suitable for our grandchildren.Much of the rest of the material was disappointing, and we won't watch it again, much less show it to anyone, so I have taken it out of circulation by throwing it in the trash."
5,beautiful,"this is an amazing album. soft intimate sad rainy loveliness. i still prefer this original elliott to the later, more produced sound, but i love it all. the best."
4,Will this satisfy your folk-rock craving? YOU BET!!,"Roman Candle is a great example of ""Elliott Unplugged."" If you're looking for some relaxing but powerful ballads and painful tuneful traumas this is where you need to turn. However, an unseasoned fan may not like this album at first due to the roughness of the recordings themselves. On the second or third listen, though, the wrinkles smooth themselves out and the true beauty of Roman Candle shows itself. My second favorite of Smith's solo efforts next to Either/Or."
3,Good but not his best.,I like this Elliott Smith release but in a way i can see why he intended not to release it as the quality of the songs in general dont seem to aspire to his earlier or present efforts however this is by no means a bad release as any release that i have heard by Elliot has been good i would just recommend anything thing else by him to this album. My personal favourite Elliot Smith album is Figure 8 and i would recommend this other any other Elliot Smith album though to be honest your not making a mistake by picking up any music by him.

4,Good Old Elliott,"Wonderfully personal. For those of you who are heartsick fans of Elliott Smith, you will find Roman Candle(1994) to be the album which best describes Elliott Smith and his style of music. Recorded in J.J, Gonson's(ex-girlfriend) basement in Portland, Oregon, the quality is minimal due to the mic being very cheap. That gives it the feeling that he's sitting right in front of you, singing to you, and only you.This album is definitly recommended to any fan."
5,elliott's best?,"As someone who owns all of Elliott Smith's albums, this album has become easily my favourite. I love all his albums, including his dreamworks albums, but this album still stands out to me as the best. I find it hard not to draw comparisons with Nick Drake's Pink Moon, which achieved a sense of intimacy and melancholy that did not exist to such a degree on his earlier more produced albums. When people say the production on this album is poor, do not expect a grainy sound or inaudible vocals. The production creates an extremely sparse sound that complements Smith's haunting, fragile voice perfectly. As you listen to this album, the amazing interplay between the vocals and unique guitar melodies on each track emerges. This, combined with the albums short (30 minute) length, results in an album without filler that never loses your attention. I think this will remembered in a similar way to Nick Drake's Pink Moon - as the masterpiece of his tragically short career."
1,Don is a musical genius...,"(and a really nice guy, too). This is the best of symphonic space music. Not to be missed."
4,Very Important,I can't believe this book has gone out of print. It is a nicely done biography by a close friend and colleague of Dr. Machen. Better still is D.G. Hart's bio. *Defending the Faith.*Dr. Machen remains one of the greatest and most misunderstood theologians of the 20th century. Stonehouse's bio. is a good place to begin understanding why.
4,Beyond bears and park rangers...,"Mr. Chase has written a book that should be required reading for anyone involved in natural resource management, be they agency professionals, activists, or recreationists. As a wildlife biologist, I found the book fascinating; Mr. Chase is able to investigate aspects of resource management that often go overlooked in today's media. Beyond that, Mr. Chase provides a brutally honest account of the evolution of Park Service policy. Whether you have a PhD in resource management or you love the park on a personal, more intimate level, this book is for you."
2,A Voice of Dissent,"I know Lowry has quite a bit of positive attention from martial artists seeking more from their training, I believe though that he falls very short of some of these reviews. I eventually had to put the book down, for my tastes, his constant self praise and promotion were not my model of a humble martial artist. For those looking for more out of your training, I would suggest The Life Giving Sword, The Demon's Sermon on Martial Arts and The Book of Five Rings; as far as a modern classic, I would say look into ""Living the Martial Way""- although it is rather small in comparison, the book ""Dojo Wisdom"" is filled with quite a bit of positive things too.I do have to say though, training is the begining and the end result. With contemplation, many people should arrive to the same conclusions which are found over and over in these books. I believe you haven't really learned the lesson until you have learned it for yourself, which is why training should be first and formost in your mind."
4,A LATE REVIEW,"This was one of Connie's very first CDs to be released in this country and doing a second ""Best Of"" would br extremely difficult considering the ground she has covered. Not everyone will be satisfied. This collection follows the hits formula and some of the songs may not be quite as well known to many. Her version of ""Time Alone Will Tell"" is nothing short of miraculous. The power and the passion is all there in one song. This is a good example of why she is not only the biggest selling and most versatile singer, but simply the best female entertainer in the business...bar none. A good collection with great sound. Recommended."
2,Not for everyone,"An odd assortment of Connie Fracis recordings spanning 1960-1967. This set contains some chart hits as well as obscure recordings that may not interest the casual fan. This highlights the ""champagne"" Connie which appealed mostly to her adult following. Not focused enough to be an effective overview as the title might suggest. If you want the big hits, see the first volume."
4,The Great One,"Much of this material I didn't have before, but I think I enjoyed seeing Jackie Gleason backstage, so to speak, getting into his different characters. He still doesn't get the respect he deserves for his work and I have to admit, loving Ralph Kramden above all others and will watch and enjoy The Honeymooners until my last breath. Maybe even after, but any Jackie Gleason fan should like this DVD."
5,The Great One,"No doubt, Jackie Gleason was the best of the best.I enjoy watching this over and over.If you think you are a fan you must get this."
4,iSpeakers,Small and o.k. sound. If you are looking for spectacular you won't find it in this little guy. Would be good for a child to use on a camping trip with their ipod. Very compact and easy to store.
3,Caricatures Virtue,"The key failing of this book from my perspective is it's superficial caricature of virtue. A key reason for the paucity of the analysis by Blackburn is he appears to prefer literary treatments of virtue to more philosophical ones, with Blackburn ignoring key virtue theorists."
3,Not stable on carpet,The toy is almost useless as a walker on any carpet. The front part is heavier than the rear part. The only way to use it on carpet in a stable way is to hold/push it from the opposite side backwards.
2,Cheap!Cheap!Cheap!,"This toy is junk! The first one I received had a broke handle and the electronic dash board only worked some of the time. Sent it back for exchange, received the second one and that had a broken horn and the same issue with the dash board. Finally just got a refund, Amazon was very pleasant the deal with."
2,Not durable; 2 buttons stopped playing after 2 months,"The concept of this product is very good. My daughter enjoy pressing the different buttons and hearing the music. However, after a couple of months use, the 2 big buttons stopped to function. These buttons unfortunately are the ones that trigger the variety of songs. Its now just half the fun and half useful!"
3,"meh, it's ok but has serious design flaws","Had I known this was a shelcore product when ordering it, I would not have let my wife purchase it. Typically, thay have very poor quality products.But truth be told, my son (14 months old) Loves to push this thing around.particularly outside. it is far heavier near the front than the rear so whenever he meets a line on the sidewalk, the walker gets stuck.Then he has to put really hard to ""unstick"" it...and of course, more often than not, it goes flying away from him and he stumbles forward, sometimes falling down.Really it needs bigger wheels and a center of mass more toward the rear of the walker. Functionally its ok and entertaining for the boy."
2,"Fun, but NOT a good walker.","This ""walker"" is useless, as a walker anyway. It is way too front-heavy and my baby has a really hard time trying to stand with it. It tips and has no wheel control, so it is too fast and she falls on her face. We have one by Little Tikes that is way better because it has adjustable wheel speeds. It is also hard for her to get her chubby little body between the sides of the ""car"". That said, the toy part of it is cute, lots of buttons to press and lots of cute noises. I am considering removing the handle so she can just play with the toy part of it and not try to kill herself standing up!"
1,YAWN,"This dull, plodding book is unsure if it wants to be a biography of Agatha Christie or engage in a long-winded, academic deconstruction of her prose.Skip this pretentious read and opt for an actual Agatha Christie novel instead."
1,Very poor customer service,"I ordered a $1500 exercise machine from Smooth Fitness and regret ever doing so! Before I even received the machine, I spent countless hours coordinating the delivery of my machine. I paid $199 for the service to deliver and set up my machine. For this additional fee, I would expect much better customer service than what I experienced.When I got frustrated with Smooth Fitness, I cancelled my order and they have made me jump through hoops! First of all, I never received the exercise machine but they are making me pay a 20% restocking fee and shipping charges! This is on top of the $1500 that they already charged to my credit card and refuse to remove the charge. I never even seen or touched the exercise machine. The Customer Service management team is very unresponsive and rude. I am still trying to get my money back but they are putting up a fight. My advice is to NEVER purchase from Smooth Fitness! They provide very poor service and are not customer friendly. Beware!"
1,CHEAP,"....If you want a watch that looks CHEAP, this is it!.....and it's so small for being a man size watch"
3,"Budget set, but there are other alternatives","No disrespect for the previous reviewer, but this set is a budget price collection of the first hanful of albums Oscar Peterson recorded early in his career. The music sounds artificial, due to the abrasive remastering of the original tapes. Indeed, you will be able to hear the piano quite clearly, though with an odd sound, but you won't have the opportunity to do the same thing with the accompaniment.Instead, both ""Exclusively with my friends"" and ""Live at the Blue Note"" sound clear as a bell and with a natural sound.I just would recommend it to someone who wants a glimpse of what Oscar could do in his first recording years."
4,Not complete...but still great!,"First of all, this is a great soundtrack to purchase for anyone who enjoys just driving around Vice City and listening to the radio. This is the reason why I bought it. However, there were a few disappointments. When I purchased the Grand Theft Auto Vice City Soundtrack Box Set, I expected every song from every music station to be included. Although most of the songs are included, a few were not. I feel that this is made up for, though, by the inclusion of DJ banter and various commercials from the game.One thing that I feel would have improved this soundtrack set would be to include the K-Chat and VCPR stations. These were both favorites of mine (along with Wave 103).Overall, I have to say that the GTA Vice City Soundtrack Box Set is a great buy if you enjoy the multiple radio stations, or if you simply want to add to your Grand Theft Auto collection! I was certainly satisfied."
3,"Great soundtrack, but more included with the game","So why, if you own the PC game, would you shell out money for this? I guess if you had a fetish for packaging, this would suit you...Seriously, if you own the PC game, you can not only listen to the radio in-game, but you can extract the radio stations to MP3 (including the chat stations, which are not included here) and then burn them as CD-Audio if you want to play them in your car or home stereo.The one thing I will give this soundtrack as a plus is that it has slightly different ads and DJ chatter to the game, which is hilarious.Just keep your road rage under control if you put it on in your car stereo."
4,Missing Songs are the best ones!!,I give it 4 stars because it is good after all..but they left out almost all of the good songs!! like last night the dj saved my life and stuff!! they would have fit on the cd like others have said..but you have to give them credit for at least coming out with the cds..oh well..
5,Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - Box Set,"The Ultimate 80's Greatist hits, that gave birth to modern rock, pop and rap a great sound track for the new generation"
1,A Disappointment,"One very important thing to understand about this box set is that it lacks much of the radio content from the game. Entire radio stations are missing! VCPR, a hilarious public-radio talk station, is conspicuously absent, and KCHAT, another funny chat station, is also gone. Also, one of my favorite songs from the game, ""Japanese Boy"" by Aneka, is not included! Similarly, ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" by The Buggles is not included! There are other examples...Well, at least they have ""I Ran"" by A Flock of Seagulls and ""99 Luftballoons"" by Nena."
2,I wish iTunes had the song I was looking for could have saved a lot of money,Here's the deal. I wanted to buy the song Kid's in America by Kim Wilde but I couldn't find it on iTunes. I play GTA Vice City a lot and figured there are some cool songs on there. What I didn't realize was how many songs that I didn't like would be on the CD's. Overall there are CD's that I really haven't even listened to. I would say save your money on this one.
4,Tommy Vercetti,"This is a great collection I loved playing the Grand Theft Auto series. The music in the games adds a life to the games. I didn't grow up in that time period but good music is still good music. I like to drive around blasting this collection and sometimes I feel like Tommy great collection. Honestly all the cds in the set are good some better than others, but in all good buy."
2,All the music is more preferable,"I was once tempted to buy this box set, however, considering I bought the game 'GTA Vice City' for nearly half the price, it didnt seem worthwhile to fork out even more to get only 70% of the audio content. - I found it faster, more cost effective, and not to mention satisfying to simply get the music from the game CDs. - And wow, it all fits on one CD. I give this box set 2 stars (as opposed to 1) because it does contain an aweful lot of wonderful music found in the game."
4,Excellent album - all the way through,I really enjoy listening to this album! Great for long drives.
5,I Asked For Wonder: A Spiritual Anthology,What more can one really say in words to describe the insights of this spiritual genius. This is a journey through the mind in order to uncover the hidden workings of the world around us. This is a study which needs to be read in order to enlighten humans to their true potential. Just a wonderful work !
5,Arcade at Home,"This item was bought for a 5 yr old who enjoys this game in the arcade in the mall. The price was excellent for this item, after intensive comparions of similar games. The balls are easy to inflate and are just the right size for little hands. There is assembly, but was not a problem. Children can play with this basketball game by themselves or with friends. Definitely recommend this game for kids who want to enjoy arcade type game at home."
5,works great,"It took some time to build , it is taller than I thought, but it works very well and is durable so far.It is excellent for the PRICE !!"
3,"Inspired, only.","This book describes the lives and beliefs of major figures among early Church Fathers of the Western Church. This has been done many times, and this book is equal to the accuracy of other treatments. But its diction is inspired and often poetic rather than scholarly or pious. The author is a wordsmith who approaches his subject as Galbraith approaches economics--with verve and a minimum of footnotes. The result is readable and a pleasure. But he undermines his case with quotations from skeptics like H. L. Menken, who are more quotable and memorable than he is. After reading this book, I remember Menken's comment that the Fathers ""reached out for a hand that wasn't there and died absurdly,"" but not one phrase in the text. A good introduction to the subject for the general reader or beginner in philosophy, but not a place to stop for faith or understanding."
3,hmmmm....,"I had really high hopes for this book, as it's been called the ""corset maker's bible""I am a designer looking to go into corsetry professionally and was under the impression that this would be more how-to and less historical prattle.If you want a book about period styles and practical advice on how they were made back ""in the day"" this is a good reference. But, if you really want to see explanations and pictures of step-by-step corset construction (like how to apply boning or how to reinforce seam allowances) this book is not at all worth the price. I'm really terribly sorry."
4,good first book on corset making,"This great book has pictures and descriptions of new and original corsets, patterns adapted form them as well as some pattern diagrams from the latter 1800s. Also, there is a great bounty of historical notes involving fashion from 17th cent. all the way up to the middle 1900s. My only dissapointment was the lack of information or patterns for the 'S' curve Edwardian era corset, but if that is of no consequence to you, overall it is a great book on making wearable and even comfortable corsets."
4,the only book of its kind,"When I first purchased this book, I was amazed at the breadth of scope that it entailed. It included history, descriptions, examples, construction, and modernization techniques for the costumer. It is obvious Mr. Doyle has spent his life experimenting and preparing to write such a one-of-a-kind reference book as this. My only complaints are these: first, the illustrations and photographs are often washed out, making it difficult to see detail. Second, his construction methods start with drafting from a french block. I wish there was more draping or even straight drafting information."
5,Love This Book,"If you are into costuming, this is one of the greatest books to own. I had originally bought this for my Corset Making Class, however this is a real find. I recommend that if your serious about period clothing!"
4,CLASSIC TUNES FROM A GUITAR LEGEND!,"Roy Buchanan played a bold and brazen guitar style that went as far as to get him the reputation of ""The greatest guitar player you never heard of."" I was lucky enough to live in the Maryland suburbs where Roy gigged mainly in the early years, and was one of his ""underground"" fans whose duty in life, it seemed occasionally, was to turn people on to this music phenom. This was the 1st Roy album I heard and I was enthralled by it. Roy takes ""Hey Joe"" to places Jimi Hendrix never dreamed. He does a wonderful Lynyrd Skynyrd-like tune called ""Home Is Where I Lost Her"". Ok, there is a couple throw aways like ""Voices"", but overall this is an album with greatness in it!"
3,text book was just as good if not better,it has some neat pictures but the textbook is just as good if not better. neat to flip through though.
3,dated,"I bought this for shipping filler and thought it might be educational for the kids. It seems a little dated. Even though the pub date says 2006, the pictures seem older. It served its purpose."
2,Quality is lacking..............,I was disappointed when this arrived. The quality is poor and uneven on the cross. There is no clarity on the body or the face on this crucifix.The chain is very weak and costume jewelry quality. Spend more money and buy either white gold or yellow gold combined with platinum.
2,over-rated,"This CD does have a good assortment of songs from the TV show. My 2 year old loves ""Elmo's Song"". However the quality of the singing in some of the songs is really bad. The theme song is particularly awful. It is sung off key by children that apparently have no talent. My son likes this CD, but I am very grateful that it is not among his favorites. I am a musician and can't stand to listen to it. The Barney, Dragon Tales, & Wiggles CDs are all much better."
5,Brings back memories,"When I bought this cd, I was transformed to my childhood since my husband and I were part of the original Sesame Street generation. Now that we have a 9 month old, we would like to share some of our fond memories of Sesame Street with him. The music is timeless, nostalgic and fun to listen to. Our baby quiets down when listening to this cd, and seems to really enjoy the catchy tunes and cleverly written songs. On our long road trip during vacation this summer, my husband and I found ourselves singing the old familiar songs and learned a few new ones we haven't yet heard. If you love Sesame Street as much as we do, this is definitely a keeper."
3,Could be better,"Like the majority of people, I grew up watching Sesame St and even continued to watch it periodically as a teen and adult. Now with two boys under the age of 4, I enjoy reviving some memories. Most of the songs are good, however, the 2nd song by ""Big Bird"" sounds as though it isn't really him singing and the song is BRUTAL. There are a few others the CD could do without and aren't really ""All Time"" favorites. They definitely missed a few on this one."
2,Okay but others are better!,"I agree with other reviewer about this not being the Sesame Street I remember. I was a little kid in the early 80's and the voices of all the characters were different than on this cd. I was disappointed and went on searching for a cd that sounded more like I remember. Then, I found the Sesame Street Old School 3 Disc Set. That one is fabulous! I highly recommend that one!"
1,Grating On the Ears,I bought this CD after seeing the high rating and reading all the great reviews. Boy was I surprised at how awful this CD was to listen to when I put it in to play for my kids. I listened to about 1.5 songs and had to change to a different CD because it was so grating on the ears. I thought maybe it was just me but several other adults have ridden in the car when songs from this CD have come on and have quickly asked to change the music. The kicker is that even the kids (currently 1.5 years old) don't like it (thankfully) so this will probably go into the donation pile shortly.
2,It was ok,I liked the older versions better. I had a cd in the 90s when I was a kid and this one didn't compare.
5,Elmo's Song!,"This CD was a lifesaver for us. My infant son hated his carseat rides until we got this CD. He especially likes the first song and ""Elmo's Song."" We've been listening to it for months, and had to buy two CD's so we would have on in the car and one in the house. Mommy and Daddy like ""Elmo's Song,"" but we also like the old favorites from when we watched Sesame Street as children. Ernie's ""Rubber Ducky"" song is a real classic!"
3,A walk down memory lane,"Sometimes walking down memory lane can be a little disappointing when you realize that the reality was not as good as the memory. Such is the case for this CD. Although it was fun to hear all of my old favorites, you quickly pick up on the out of tune singing and irritating music. My daughter (20 months) is not crazy about this CD, either."
3,Sound quality could be better,"The songs on this CD are fine; we own a lot of them on tapes (cassettes are better for my kids since they have their own little tape players, of the Fisher-Price type), but the sound quality of many of the recordings is not high. My 4 yo enjoys hearing the songs and dancing along with the music."
3,"annoying to me, but great for kids","I got annoyed with hearing those voices all the time, but kids like it, so it gets 3 stars."
3,"Platinum Favorites Fun, but a bit too old school.",My 14 month old seems to enjoy the CD. There are some songs that we really enjoy like Elmo's Song. The ones we like tend to be the slightly newer songs. But a lot of the songs are really a bit too old school. Why couldn't they find kids who could actually sing in tune to sing the Sesame Street theme song. This off-key rendition makes my teeth ache.
2,not what I remember,"If you're in your late 30s or early 40s, this is not the Sesame Street you remember. I would not call this ""Platinum"". Maybe Copper or Silver. hehehe. The newer voices singing the familiar songs is kind of sad, and the newer songs aren't that great. Particularly disappointing is the Sesame Street Theme. I don't remember the children's voices being so SHOUTY and annoying. Why must they scream, barely on pitch? :-) Pass on this recording."
4,Nice mixture of songs,"As an old-school Sesame Street fan, I was looking for something with all the favorites from my childhood days. This CD has a nice variety of many of the favorites. I enjoy listening to this with my daughter and would recommend it to anyone looking for their Sesame Street favorites from their childhood days."
5,Reasonable Prudent Person Standard does not apply!,"While reading the excerpts you will be in shock and awe. When that state subsides, you will likely realize how smart you look and sound in comparison! This one is worth lots of laughs and unforgettable scenarios!"
2,Disorder in the Court: Great Fractured Moments in Courtroom History (R rated edition),This book should be R rated in that the F word occurs regular and there is a lot of very crude humor.The book has some funny stuff that a layman would enjoy but it is few and far between. This is really written for lawyers.
2,FRACTURED- A CORRECTLY TITLED BOOK,THE ADVERTISING HYPE FOR THE BOOK CONTAINS FUNNIER MATERIAL THAN THE BOOK ITSELF. WORTH READING FROM COVER TO INDEX. THE PAGES WOULD BE MORE USEFUL TO USE AS A DUSTPAN FOR SMALL JOBS
2,Fun or Filth?,Bought this book to give as a gift but couldn't give it because of the language used. I don't think humor needs the gutter to make it funny...
3,Disorder in the court,"It's funny, which is what it is supposed to be. I guess it shows the human side of court proceedings, but it's a bit disillusioning. I thought court would be more professional on the part of the professionals."
2,Was disappointed,"I would not buy another of this series of book, or by this author. I didn't find very much of it amusing as it seemed to advertise it would be. There were a few funny things, but over all not worth the money to me personally."
5,Hilarious!,A funny look at the system of law in the U.S. So much for staid courtrooms and stiff attorneys. Very funny.
5,More laughs than a Patricia C book.,"While it true that some funny moments are present in crime books, This was a laugh fest that lasted almost from start to finish. Some of the jokes I didn't get, but others had me and my friends panting for air. It explains why for so long the legal system has struggled to be as effective as it would like. The IQ of some of the DAs had to be lower than their age and some of the comments could have been correctly made by a wooden spoon.A well put together piece of work, all round."
2,disappointing,I expected laugh out loud. This book is somewhat entertaining and it's probably funnier to anyone who works in the courts. For a lay person it is only mildly amusing.
3,Light reading with a different twist,This is a good book to kill time and find some good stories to tell. Many of these tales have come across my desk as emails and they will likely provide a lot more material. Worth the price but some of the material streches the imagination.
5,Great service,"Thank You very much. Got the book very quickly, it was in a good shape and the price was reasonable. Have a good summer, everyone!Larry Kärkkäinen, Helsinki, Finland"
1,Disappointed,"I bought an XTreme Kong long ago & it is the only dog toy that has withstood the powerful jaws of my dog - an XTreme chewer! I decided to purchase a few of the other XTreme products manufactured by Kong, hoping they would be as long-lasting. This product, the ""XTreme Goodie Ball"" was a big disappointment as it was chewed up in a matter of minutes by my dog. I would definitely NOT recommend this ""Goodie Ball"" to any pet owner that has an aggressive chewer."
5,Great if your dog is not an agressive chewer,My dog loves the Kong Mini Goodie ship. I own 3 and pack them with about 1 oz of meat each. It takes him about 5 minutes to finish each. Great for dinner or snack times when you don't want your dog begging.
5,José Alfredo Jimenez,"This album contains the best Jose Alfredo`s songs, has a great sound and the CD is in very good condition."
5,I keep it in the bathroom,"This is a breathtaking overview of Irish poetry. Great history in some of the older ones. I could have wished for more of that, but then there wouldn't have been as much room for the masters. I keep this one in the bathroom so I can take in some bits and chunks when I have a minute. It's a classic!"
3,Pretty good.,"No More Tears is a satisfying and energetic album. All of the tracks are pretty cool. This disc is in a straight-ahead hard rock direction. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. Ozzy does a nice job with the vocals. Zakk Wylde's guitar work is also skilled. He can really shred. My favorite tunes are ""No More Tears,"" ""Mama, I'm Coming Home,"" and ""Time after Time."" The other tracks are listenable, too. I've always admired ""No More Tears."" It's one of Ozzy's best songs. He really did a good job with it. The keyboard playing is very lush and ethereal. It sounds quite different from the other songs. ""Mama, I'm Coming Home"" and ""Time after Time"" are good power ballads. This is a good album. It's worth a listen."
3,zakk,"this album has some great songs on it,it should be a 3.5,the reason i cant rate it any higher is that some of the tracks are downright cheesy such as the opening mr.tinkertrain,aside from that there are alot of great tunes on here such as mama,the road to nowhere,time after time etc zakks playing is great,somewhat sounding like a gary rossington here,definitely amust have."
4,Ozzy enters in the 90's,"He was there in the 70's with all time classic rock with Black Sabbath.He continues to rock in the 80's and there he goes in the 90's, a great pure rock album. Ozzy even got some major hits like Mama I'm coming home and No more tears. Zaak Wylde is just amazing. A very good addition to your cd collection. Good work Ozzy !"
5,too freakin good,"ozzy seems to know how to resurect his career very well. after sabbath gave him the boot he blew the lid off with blizzard of ozz and diary of a madman. then came the so-so records bark at the moon and ultimate sin. just as things start going downhill he comes out with this metal masterpiece. no filler, all rock. highlights are mr tinkertrain, i dont want to change the world, time after time, mama im coming home and of course no more tears. if you like ozzy or black sabbath then this is a must own. unless you are living in a cave you have probably heard most of these songs on the radio."
5,One of Ozzy's Most Powerful Works,"No More Tears, released in 1991, was a huge hit commercially. Listen to it and you will see why. The songs are straight-ahead metal with a commercial oversheen. This was Ozzy's second album with virtuoso guitarist Zakk Wylde, who added the crunching metal parts to this album. This album gave Ozzy his first solo Top Forty hit, with Mama I'm Coming Home, which rose to #28 in 1991. It is kind of suprising that this album was such a hit, considering this was 1991, at the height of the grunge era. Maybe it was just that it was so good, it would be impossible to ignore it."
3,Mr. Tinkertrain--Such A Strange Name For A Song,"As with Heart's ""Red Velvet Car"", which would be produced nearly three decades after this disc by the same record company, there is one glaring sore spot for Ozzy's ""No More Tears"", and it is with the opening track, ""Mr. Tinkertrain"", which I find eerily creepy. I understand Ozzy may have recorded this song because he may have been abused as a child himself, but I hope he isn't glorifying the most abominable crime known to man. The rest of the album is okay, with the bonus track ""Don't Blame Me"" being a surprise standout. But did Ozzy have to make Mr. Tinkertrain?"
3,Experimental.,This is a decent album from Ozzy. Not as powerful as his previous releases but does contain some classic songs he still performs today.
4,This is really really good metal.,"This album was my first Ozzy album. I'd heard Crazy Train and Bark at the Moon and Paranoid before, and other Black Sabbath Tracks, but never No More Tears or Mama I'm Coming Home. This album is his first with guitarist Zakk Wyldde (Who you should check out, his band is the Black Label Society.) With 2 or three grammy winning tracks, and the credits boast that some of the tracks, like the power ballad Mama I'm Coming Home, or Hellraiser, were written by the singer/bassist of Motorhead, Ozzys longtime friend, Lemmy."
2,"Some Generic Metal, A Few Keepers","Ozzy's second record with speed demon Zakk Wylde is another Ozzy recording ruined by bad production. As I noted in my review of No Rest For The Wicked, it's a wonder that Ozzy would redo drums and bass on his first recording, yet leave Wicked and Tears unscathed. Both are desperatly in need of new drums, or at least an ADD remastering. The drums are a bit improved here, but still drenched in tinny echo.Mr. Wylde's collaborative chemistry with Ozzy fails to improve on this outing, laden with more mundane metal. I made a playlist of Ozzy/Wylde recordings, and it was a struggle to find four tunes from either Wicked or Tears to include. No More Tears is one of Ozzy's best songs, however."
5,Ozzy at his heaviest!,This album is so good! I love it! Ozzy's heaviest album in my opinion. This is a CD that really gets you in a good mood. With Zakk Wylde on guitar you can't go wrong. If you are just getting into Ozzy's music then BUY THIS CD! You won't regret it!
3,Has Some Okay Moments,"I received this album a little while after it was first released a few years ago. It's not one of Ozzy's best in my opinion. Good production, nice playing, but most of the songs are standard. The song ""No More Tears,"" stands on its own as the best song on this album. The song is still great after all these years. The synth playing really leaves a great impression to this day. One of his classic songs. ""Hellraiser,"" ""Time After Time,"" and ""Mama I'm Coming Home"" are also okay. The song ""No More Tears"" is worth the price payed on this album, but the rest of the songs are okay."
5,No More Tears = Greatest Album,"Over the years, what have you come to expect from the Godfater of Metal? Killer guitar solos, heavy bass lines, and deep lyrics. This album is no dissapointment. Tracks like Hellraiser, Mr. Tinkertrain, and the title track No More Tears are very uplifting and enjoyable to listen too. No song found on this album will have you saying ""Why did the Godfather of Metal let me down?"" This album is a must have for anyone's CD collection."
2,Average for Ozzy,I've always liked Ozzy with or without Black Sabbath.No more tears has mostly ok songs but few stand out as excellent. Mr. Tinkertrain has strange lyrics but is probably the best song on the cd. Hellraiser is a motorhead song featured at the end of Hellraiser 3 and Ozzy's version of it is pretty good. Zombie stomp is interesting and cool sounding. Desire is melodic.The complaints are that No more tears has a weak mixing and mastering production. It doesn't have that rich and resonating heavy sound you hear in a lot of good sounding metal cds. Also you can also tell this was recorded when Ozzy wasn't at his prime. His voice sounds a little bit strained and shot. Zack is great guitarist but he doesn't get to show off his skills too much or too often on this cd. There are also too many cornball ballads on this. .I give no more tears a C+
3,good but not the best,"I don't like this album, but is my own opinion, for me no rest for the wicked is more good."
3,Great title track,"1991. Back from high school. A quick snack. Switch on telly. MTV. Great rock song - who is that? Waiting for the end caption. Artist Ozzy Osbourne, song No More Tears, album No More Tears. Ozzy Osbourne! Isn't that that crazy guy? Is he still alive?Out to the record shop. Buy album. Not bad. Great rock. Heavyer than most stuff then. But contrasted with Ozzy's kinda whining voice.The A Side is nearly perfect. Especially the 7:24 minute title track - nearly epic. Other highlights are the opener Mr Tinkertrain and the closer Road To Nowhere. But unfortunately No More Tears fades in quality on the B Side, and you start getting enough of Ozzy's voice."
5,Ithink ozzy is the true godfather of metal,this is ozzy best as of yet ithink he should keep on making the best of his records and making ozzfest as long as can .
4,Ozzy's Last Great Album ....so far,"This is probably Ozzy's best album after his debut, ""Blizzard of Ozz"". This one is just loaded with great songs, everything fromhit ballads like ""Mama, I'm Coming Home"" and classic rock staples like the epic title song and ""Time After Time"" and ""Road To Nowhere"". The hard rock side of his musical persona is well represented by ""Zombie Stomp"" amd the disturbing ""Mr. Tinkertrain"". If you are a recent fan via ""The Osbournes"" T.V show, then this is a very good and accessible Ozzy album to startwith."
3,Great First Half. Blows It The Second Half,"No More Tears is worth buying on the strength of the first five songs alone. ""Mr. Tinkertrain"", ""I Don't Wanna Change The World"", ""Mama, I'm Coming Home"", ""Desire"", and ""No More Tears"" are some of the best songs Ozzy Osbourne has ever recorded. To be honest, ""No More Tears"" is just as good as anything from the Randy Rhoads days. The bad news is the momentum dies after the title track. With the exception of the song ""Zombie Stomp"", there really isn't anything worth listening to. Enjoy."
2,poor customer service,"This game takes a long time to install and internet product registration is required. If you do not have internet access, you cannot play. After I had established an account with jumpstart when installing this game on my computer, I then wanted to install it on my daughter's computer as well. I was denied access to the account that I had just established, so I requested the password be emailed to me. The email never came. I established a new account just to get the thing installed, but it is doubtful I will buy any more jumpstart products until they design a quicker and more efficient installation process."
5,JumpStart 1st Grade,"I am a huge fan of these video games. They are wonderful tutorials for young children and they make it fun to learn. They are plug and play which means that you put the disc in the computer and you are ready to go. If your child needs tutoring, these games may be the answer for you. My grown children used them and now I have purchased them again for my granddaughter. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,NOT Compatible with OS X 10.5,"I was really ready to get this product, however, it is not OS X 10.5 Compatible. You must have classic mode to run this disc (MAC). 10.5 DOES NOT SUPPORT classic mode."
3,Good learning tool,Something fun for the summer so that my child doesnt forget what he learned the year before.
2,Wrong game,I ordered this thinking this was the updated 2000 version(you know the one with interactive classroom/schoolhouse and the hippopotamus teacher?) but got the new 3D game which I don't really care for. I should've asked to return it and get the copy I wanted but I just didn't wanna cause a scene. Oh wel :) Live and learn right?
4,A Hit with My Sons,This is a regularly read book at bedtime. My 4-year old twin sons each have to pick a story almost nightly--and they usually want more than two stories. It's a good compliment to the videos.
5,Book with good values,"This book came in good shape (since this was a older book, I was not expecting much). The color is vivid and stories are well written. Similar to Thomas Trian book, it translates good values via stories. I bought this same book again for another 3-yr old boy and he demands a story everynight from this book. It is a good way to exercise my muscle too as he takes it with him everywhere after his bath at night to get ready for story time."
2,Bob's Boring Episode Synopses,"I'm not familiar enough with the series to know for sure, but these stories sound a lot like summaries of BTB episodes to me. The writing is bland, and feels like one must trudge to the end of each story. I guess this book is innocuous enough, but lacks the imaginative language that would make a child want to read it for himself/herself. Can we endure it? Yes, we can. But, hey! Isn't that a Dr. Seuss book next to it on the shelf! Let's read that one instead tonight..."
1,Disappointed,"I bought an XTreme Kong long ago & it is the only dog toy that has withstood the powerful jaws of my dog - an XTreme chewer! I decided to purchase a few of the other XTreme products manufactured by Kong, hoping they would be as long-lasting. This product, the ""XTreme Goodie Ship"" was a big disappointment as it was chewed up in a matter of minutes by my dog. I would definitely NOT recommend this ""Goodie Ship"" to any pet owner that has an aggressive chewer."
4,Very Enjoyable! Laid-back easy reading.,"I would reccommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered what it would be like to live on an Island. Hazel Heckman gives the reader a very enjoyable historical account of Anderson Island, in the Puget Sound. It's a taste of Northwest History along with charming stories of Islanders present and past. A must read for anyone who enjoys natural history and has a yearning to experience life on an Island."
3,Messy Cuban Murder Mystery with too many clues . . .,"Someone has murdered the son of a prominent Cuban exile. Someone has taken this powerful man's son and his wife is the prime suspect.The murder took place on the Marine Base in Guantanamo, Cuba. And so the story begins.There is a damsel in distress. There is the ""prince . . . heir to the throne."" There is Castro's Cuba and all that it entails. There are secrets to be kept and secrets to be told.I like Jack Swyteck and I'll read more of his stories. This was was a little over the top to me. Too many red herrings in the gulfstream for my liking.I loved Jack's crusty grandmother and my favorite parts of the book were when Jack was in Cuba, trying to save his client and discover his past."
4,very nice plot and story-telling,"this book has a very interesting (if not improbable) plot. it does keep you guessing till the end. the story telling is fine, not too much useless details. i give it a 4 star because the story itself and the characters are a little bit lackluster."
3,Just So So,"Although I do like the character of Jack Swytek, I was very disappointed with the repeated reminders of his previous exploits. However, it was still a good read."
1,DID WE READ THE SAME BOOK??,"I am surpised that this is the same author who wrote ""Last to Die."" I am half-way through this book and am so bored with it that I will probably not finish it. It's all about this lady who is accused of killing her husband and it turns out this lady is the adoptive mother of Jack Swyteck's son. She threatens Jack if he doesn't represent her that he will never see his son. So, because her husband was in the military in Guantanamo, Cuba, Jack makes trips back and forth to Cuba to get some information about her husband and everyone keeps stonewalling him and not giving him information because everything is confidential. So, he has to go back and forth and back and forth to get tidbits of information. And, he makes some side trips to his mother's birthplace near Cuba. That's it. That's the story so far. No suspense. No character development. No trial (yet). So boring!! Don't waste your money."
2,I don't believe it!,"If you want a tour of Cuba or Miami including restaurants an hotels. Read this book.If you want to read a biography. Read this book.If you want to read the epilogue of the book ""Beyond Suspicion"" by the same writer (its prequel). Read this book.If you want to read how a paramount lawyer can be deceived once and again. Read this book.If you want to read a thriller read the last 50 pages of this book.So, if you want to waste your time. Read this book.The first book of the series ""The Pardon"" was very good.The second book was OK. But this one swoops like an eagle."
4,A fun diversion,"Grippando delivers another far above average thriller in the Jack Swyteck mystery series. Hear No Evil is entertaining and a fun diversion made special with the narration of Campbell Scott. Scott is one of those actors whose voice is familiar and comforting, yet he's not so famous that the listener is distracted by an image of him in their head. His authoritative voice has the right balance of masculinity to perfectly portray Swyteck. He likewise does a perfunctory job with Cuban accents - making them believable without being over the top, cliché, or Mexican. Hear No Evil weaves Cuban-American politics into a fun, action packed thriller."
3,Not As Good As I Expected!,"This story was interesting in spurts, with an ending that left a lot to be desired. Which is surprising for me when it comes to a James Grippando novel. He usually has me turning the pages at warp speed, anxious to see what comes next, but this time the story just didn't grab me. I never once felt any kind of compassion for Lindsey. Too many lies. That being said I still look forward to what comes next with Jack."
4,Could have been better,"First off I will say this is the first Manic Street Preacher I bought. After listening to it, I ended up buying all their albums. All the songs on the album are great but after listening to all their albums, you realize that there are so many songs that should have been put in and others that shouldn't. Like many reviewers say, it was disappointing that one only song from the Holy Bible was put on there. The Holy Bible was the Manic's best album yet only Faster was the only song on there. This album is still a good way to start if you want to get into the Manic Street Preachers."
3,"Good, but not great","I was some what disappointed to listen to Forever Delayed. I thought that the album could have benefited from a couple of tracks from the Holy Bible album. On the bright side though, I think that the remix disc is a great extra to the album. If you are unfamiliar with the music of MSP, then this would be a good introduction to them. If you already own their albums, then this would only be good for the extra disc."
3,Not the best book on rabbits,"We are raising rabbits for food. I actually got interested in this and saw it as a possibility because of one of Bob Bennett's other books: ""Raising Rabbits Successfully"", which our library had. When I saw he had written the Storey's Guide on the subject, I felt pretty confident that it would be a good reference for the bookshelf. I also expected it to be a more updated versionThis book may be adequate, but I found it difficult to chase down specific pieces of information - such as age for slaughter, age for weaning, etc. Mr Bennett is a font of information, and this book does contain valuable information, but falls short of his previous work. Storey's is generally the place to start when learning about livestock. In view of his previous work, I found this book a little disappointing."
1,NOT for rabbit lovers!,"The only things in this book to recommend it would be the ideas for building rabbit sheds and the black and white photos of various breeds.Some of these ideas are just so out of date! I can't understand how anyone could recommend keeping rabbits in all-wire cages with no bedding. 'Don't let them on grass because they will get parasites and don't let them in the house or you are asking for trouble'.The sections on slaughtering are probably good for those who are only interested in rabbits for meat, but if you care about rabbits at all, steer well clear of this one!"
3,Way too big,"I like the look and feel of this dinnerware, but will be returning it because unfortunately the dinner plates are HUGE. A full 2"" bigger around than my current corelle dinner plates. I have a Bosch dishwasher -- a deluxe, full-sized model and these plates are so big that you can't fit a second set of dishes in."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I purchase this itam for a Christmas gift for my Mother. I received it on 11-6-06. There is 4 broken pieces. I contacted customer service and the rep. kept reading the return policy that the whole set had to be returned. The Supervisor refused to get on the phone. I wrote an email and complained and I told them the reviews indicated Amazon worked with other customers to replace the broken pieces. I recieved, this morning, an email stating I had to return the whole set. I don't under the problem since they sell the individual pieces on their wed site. The set is pretty but not worth the aggravation. 11-9-06"
1,Plates don't fit in any standard upper cabinet!,The set arrived in good condition as far as i can tell since i only took out the top dinner plate and tried to put it in my kitchen cabinet. All of my cabinets are standard kitchen cabinets and they clearly do not fit. WAY too big. Since all standard kitchen cabinets have outside depth of twelve inches I don't know who's cabinets they could fit in. They would only work in a corner cabinet or dish rack. I think this is a significant design flaw. I will be returning the set.
2,Displeased with Replacement policy for shipping damage,"Although the dinnerware is lovely, I was very displeased with the replacement policy. I had two broken pieces when thebox arrived. I put away the dishes and threw away the box. When I called Amazon I was informed that I needed to return the entire set and they would replace the entire set. Since I no longer had the packing materials, it was simply too much trouble to buy an appropriate box and packing materials to protect the dishes for shipping, repack everything, and take it to be mailed. I am annoyed that I have to now replace the broken pieces at my expense through Mikasa and pay the shipping charges."
4,better than expected,I was really happy with the product and did not have any issues with chipping or color as others have spoken of. I did receive with one broken plate and would have had to send the whole set back to get a new plate. So I ended up having to pay for another one. I would also expect to buy some additional items to round out the set. If you buy the four cereal bowls they a large enough to use as side dish bowls. I also bought a large platter.I am very happy with the product.
5,Don't hesitate to buy this set,This set of stoneware is beautiful and functional. I plan to use it for everyday but it is perfect for special occasions. The dishes arrived quickly and were packaged well. Every piece of the set was perfect. I did hesitate to order because I worried about breakage but my worries disappeared when all the dishes were unpacked without any problems. The price is excellent for this set and there are many matching pieces available. I was very pleased with my purchase.
4,Beautiful Dinnerware!! Broken pieces :(,"I LOVE this pattern! It is very simple and elegant. I fell in love with Lenox Butler's Pantry, but couldn't find it in a complete set, and the Italian Countryside came in a close second, so I ordered it. I'm very pleased with the quality. There are a few minor flaws in the glaze, but nothing I can't overlook.The only downside was that upon arrival, three pieces were totally shattered. Amazon sent a replacement set, I traded out the three broken pieces, and returned the rest at no cost (although a little inconvenience) to me. I also found several pieces in the replacement set were broken, so there is obviously an issue with packaging and/or shipping.Overall, I am very pleased with my new dinnerware! Beautiful!"
2,chips easily,"I have been using this dinnerware for over a year and am finding more and more chipped pieces. The dishes are pretty and easy to work with, but I will have to replace them sooner than I had planned. If you are looking for hardworking, long lasting dinnerware, then skip these and choose something else."
1,Not Microwave Safe,"The bowls and plates are not microwave safe!. Every one we have has hairline cracks in the glazed side. You can not heat soup or any other item, they will discolour and crack. I called Mikasa and they told me that the dishes and bowls will absorb water and cause the cracking. Over the years I have purchased other Mikasa dishware and they never had this problem."
4,More Joe Lynn Turner.,I cannot see why this is such an under the radar CD? Joe Lynn Turner voice turns albums to gold.
1,THIS SUCKS,THE WORST ALBUM DEEP PURPLE EVER DID. Thank Goodness Joe Lynn Turner was kicked-out. Don't Buy This. This Sucks. I have to put 1 star 'cos there ain't a ZERO rating.
1,Burn this,"Rainbow meets Deep Purple. What a concept. this album along with ""Bananas"" are the only two serious blemishes in the studio Deep Purple catalogue. This album flatly sucks. Joe Lynn Turner is an average singer at best. Hard to believe that the band that turned down Rod Stewart early in his career would ever consider a singer like him. and the rest of the band is just going through the motions tring to recapture their glory years with subpar material at best. Avoid this at all costs. Not for diehards, not for anybody!! Go to The Battle Rages On. And if you're a Deep Purple fan from the 70's looking for Purple music, try Purpendicular or Rapture Of The Deep. Heed my advice!!"
4,An Extremely Original Effort!,"Back around 1990 I kept hearing this song on FM Rock stations called King of Dreams. I absolutely loved the sound and the vocals of it. When I found out it was Deep Purple I was blown away. I grew up listening to DP in the 70's, first from the ""Made in Japan"" album, then at the Californis Jam. To me it didn't matter who the lead singer was, it was all about the music. VERY few groups could boast the tightness of DP with Blackmore and Lord trading solos. Needless to say I ran right out and bought the tape.Overall this is a slightly different sounding DP. Of course Turner as lead singer contrasts with any other singer DP ever had. He has more of a gritty sound to him, and the music here seems to have been included to accentuate that. Highlights here are the afore-mentioned ""King of Dreams"", ""The Cut Runs Deep"" and ""Wicked Ways"". All three can match up well to any Deep Purple song.I would recommend this to any DP fan who is looking for a very strong sounding CD."
2,NOT A GOOD PURPLE ALBUM!!!!,"SLAVES & MASTERS is not a bad album, but it's not like a DEEP PURPLE album...the truth is, PURPLE NEED IAN GILLAN'S vocals!!!!! He is not only one of THE MOST INFLUENTIAL singers ever, but also write cool lyrics and yells and roars in perfect harmony!!! the singer here is not bad, but don't sound like PURPLE at all..."
3,"Good, but not very Deep Purple","The music is solid, certainly Deep Purple. The singing leaves more to wish for. Keeps one wondering, is it really his voice or is the recording that poor. No match for full vocal frontmen Gillan and Coverdale. All on all, worth while purchasing and owning."
3,Slaves and Masters,"Band Personnell:Joe Lynn Turner - Vocals and MidfieldRitchie Blackmore - Guitars and WingerRoger Glover - Bass, Defender and Additional KeyboardsIan Paice - Drums and Centre ForwardJon Lord - Organs, Keyboards and String ArrangementsThe only Deep purple album to feature former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner, this resulted that they needed much more instruments such as Winger and Defender, it's a good album but it doesn't fit onto the sound of Deep Purple, it sounds much more as a Rainbow (with Turner) album something many Deep Purple fans didn't appreciated, they wanted Gillan back, the same did Glover, Paice and Lord, so Blackmore had to kick Turner before they finished another album."
3,Should have been a Rainbow reunion,"This cd isn't terrible, but it's not DP. I've never been a huge Joe Lynn Turner fan. Sounds like Michael Bolten trying to sing heavy metal. Ok for budget price, but not a must have for anyone. I liken it to the Van Halen 3 cd with Gary cherone. Not the real deal.Deep Purple has had many many line up changes over the years, but the mk2 is the best."
2,Ugh,"Deep Purple NEVER made a bad album until this trainwreck. According to an interview with Joe Lynn Turner:""It's a shame. Some members may got jealous to RB, me and Jim Peatric who were recreating Deep Purple sound.""Yeah, these guys recreated Deep Purple to sound like every other generic 80's power ballad band. Thanks alot Joe Lynn Turner, you ruined a perfect career. The only positive part of this album that gives it two starts is some of the playing from Ritchie and Jon."
4,A great under-rated album,"I've had this album, since it was released, and was just listening to it recently (October 2006), so my review is not just based on the pleasure of a first listen.I was impressed with this album when it was initially released, and remain so to this day. From a guitar point of view, it's probably the last album where Blackmore was given a free rein, and I enjoy his work on this.As far as songwriting goes, my favourite track, would have to be ""Fire in the Basement"", I would love to see how that worked out live. I really get the feeling, it would be an equal to ""Lazy"".I have to acknowledge those who refuse to credit this as a Deep Purple album, and refer it it as Rainbow. I find this hard to understand, given that the Ian Gillan Band been releasing product under the Deep Purple brand for how many years now?"
3,Deep Rainbow??,"The first and only Deep Purple album to have Joe Lyn Turner (Rainbow) on lead vocals. If you like the music output that was Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice this isn't the album for you. If you liked the circa 1980's Rainbow then this the album for you. Not a bad album just not what you would expect from Deep Purple. Best song on here is King of Dreams but sounds like it should've been on Rainbow's Difficult to Cure."
4,underrated,"I enjoyed this CD quite a bit, despite negative reviews. It is certainly a more melodic and commercial album than 70s purple, but so was House of the Blue Light anyway. I found JLT's vocals enjoyable (as usual). If you liked the more commercial aspects of his album with Malmsteen, you will like this.Comparing this to Van Halen 3 is unfair given the abismal quality of that release. Give it a try"
4,Nice figure but fragile,"I just got my Dwarf and he looks pretty awesome. I got him for a display piece in my mancave. I used to play WoW and recently found out about these figures. When I opened it the mace handle broke and had to be super glued , I think this is very common with this figure and Dc Direct has more than likely made the new figures more durable. It did upset me seeing I payed about double what the retail was on Blizzards site, but what ya gona do? The packaging is kinda boring so displaying him out of package is your best bet. I used to never open my figures but to be honest unless you have a super rare expensive figure that has a limited run, most of the toys today are made by the hundred thousands. Now that i am order I have realized that value is what makes me happy displaying them and not a price in a toy catalog. Honestly I would never sell any of my figures anyhow so does it really matter what people say they are worth?"
1,don't believe it,"I bought this item with the associated male cord cap, thinking I had purchased a matched pair, as they were advertised as such. When items arrived, lo and behold, the enclosure was too small to allow the door to be closed when the cap is inserted. Thanks for nothing, guys!"
3,Trouble finding a correct hub.,"Sturdy , well made.Can't find a hub with the same screw pattern. Had to make a standard hub fit by drilling different holes in the hub.Perhaps the manufacturer makes a 1 1/4"" hub"
5,No funny Hats is amazing,I agree with the previous reviewer. I was going to say the same things about it but he beat me to it. The album is like being there and the quality is A-1. I recommend this cd to all Buddy Rich fans. Its a must have cd!
5,Buddy the King of all times,No one in my opinion can really compare with how he could controll the swing of a big band. this is a fabulous tight band that I believe Buddy said was his all time favorite! With listening to this you really appreciate why he is the Worlds Greatest Drummer! He is so alive today with his fantastic Music that will live forever.Jim Paxton
4,A child gardner's must have,"My 4 year old son loves this book! He memorized most of it which helped him learn what we needed to do next in the garden. Then, we couldn't remember the next line. We went back to the library without title or author and just what we memorized. THe librarian found it! Hurray!I would have easily given it five stars but the illustrations aren't my favorite.When I see all the other Douglas FLorian book I have trouble keeping from buying LOTS!"
3,Useful and informative,"An excellent book full of info about this little known country. Phots are good, narrative is easy and very informative. I particularly liked the section dealing with accommodation. It put my mind at rest about ""occupied greek hotels"". It seems that only 3 or 4 Greek Cypriot owned hotels are available in north Cyprus. All the others have been built since the war in 1974, and therefore I have no irksome thoughts about going there. Excellent read"
1,Last thing that Northern Cyprus needs is a Guide !!,"Are you aware that North Cyprus has been occupied since 1974 after a violatiion of every single Human Right, by Turkey? Guide to Northern Cyprus for whom? For tourists ? The people whosr property was taken away from them definitely know their way around. What they need is to be able to go there without been shot down"
1,A perfect place to be,"If you want to visit a place occupied by Turkey 33 years now, this guide is perfect for you... (just bear in mind that Turkey's invasion in Cyprus had caused thousands of deaths and thousands more to flee to the free south part)."
3,the quickest of thoughts,"yet another 'messed up girl grows up' memoir. it's sentimental and well-written, but as a guy, i found it hard to relate."
1,Dragged On and On...,"I was so disappointed!... I did enjoy ""The Liar's Club"" and fully expected to devour ""Cherry"" but it was not to be. This account of Mary Karr's adolescence seemed to drag on endlessly.The style of writing I found riveting in ""Liar's Club"" began wearing on me very early in ""Cherry"". At times it reminded me of an essay a kid writes in school with lots of big words to impress a teacher. There comes a time in this book when Karr's prose stops being lyrical and just becomes annoying.That's to say nothing of the storyline which was monotonous and repetative. When the teenaged Mary got stoned or starts tripping, I felt as though it was really happening. Her storytelling brain cells must have burned-up on re-entry. It was as if ""Liar's Club"" and ""Cherry"" were written by two different authors. I'll be looking forward to the next book by the woman who wrote ""Liar's Club""."
2,Intially entertaining but pure drudgery by the end,"This book was very entertaining. light-hearted and fun, for the first half. Intially, I could relate to the stories and emotions. However, I couldn't relate at all in the second half and no longer found the stories or people interesting, just pathetic. By then I was also tired of the flip-flop writing style. Some stories are told in a narrative sense and some are told about Mary and her friends & family as if it is you and your friends and family. I found that quite irksome."
2,"If you didn't do drugs, it might be hard to get into","I have never done drugs, so I couldn't relate or even understand a lot of this book, and it was incredibly depressing to boot. I found myself skimming pages as well -- I had plenty of teenage angst, but I couldn't relate to this one."
1,WTF?,"After reading, and loving, The Liar's Club for the second time, I thought I'd give Cherry a try. I knew the reviews weren't as favorable, but given the caliber of TLC I figured it had to be halfway decent. And the small percentage of it written in first person was. The rest of it, however, was UNREADABLE. Second person narration is a device that can work in small doses. But chapter after chapter? WHY??? I see no valid reason for this decision. Couldn't even finish this book. If I were you, I wouldn't bother starting it."
4,Great Book,"I bought this book because I loved her first one ""The Liars' Club"" so much. To be honest, had I started with ""Cherry"" I probably would not have been interested enough to read anything else by her. But by the end of ""The Liars' Club"" you feel as if she's a close friend so you want to read ""Cherry"" to find out what happens in her life after that. She's also a poet, but I'm not a fan of poetry so I can't tell how if her poetry books are any good. I highly, highly recommend ""The Liars' Club"" and then ""Cherry""."
4,"I Like Mary (or Houston, we've got a live one here...)","While I didn't think Liar's Club quite held up to the reviews, I still enjoyed it. Cherry is more fun. Karr's view of teenage girl sexuality is lively, refreshing, and, I think, pretty true. Karr's poet's eye picks out interesting detail in an adolescent life. And, if you were ever any kind of a slacker or a beach bum, or a druggie, she is hilarious. Personally, I have never read a description of an LSD trip that is as funnya and true as Karr's. I cried with laughter. Karr is clearly just an interesting person. I'm encouraged to check out the poetry now."
5,Amazing read,"I picked this up in a charity shop. (I have not read 'The Liars Club'.) I was absolutely sucked in by the vivid writing, I was there in 1970's Texas from page 1.... The negative reviews for this book frequently state that this i nothing like 'TLC' and that's why they don't like it. Thought I would add a positive review for those going in from nothing. Amazing book, vivid, honest, dark. Best book I've read in ages."
2,An interesting story written in such boring prose,"I am so disappointed with the way in which Karr chose to write this memoir. I was tempted to put it down more than once while I was reading it, but her subject matter kept me interested, and I did finish it. However, her style of writing is just not for me. There is hardly any use of dialog between any of the characters - the majority of the story is told as one long description of the things around her, which I found very dull. I feel that written in another way, this would have been much more interesting to read. Not sure if I will continue on to the Liar's Club, which I didn't realize was the prequel to this one."
2,Cherry Not What I Hoped For,"I read Liar's Club for a book club and I loved it. It was funny, gripping, and gritty. I truly enjoyed the way she told her story, the good, the bad, and the ugly of her childhood. I was so thrilled to see that she had a second book published. But upon reading it I was highly disappointed. I was never able to get into it - it did not have the same powerful grasp of story that the first book did. I found that I had to keep working at reading it, rather than wanting to read it! I did not like the secodn person style she took in writing this book. It wasn't the content of the book that disappointed me, it was the way she told it to us that did. I will read what comes next from Mary Karr because I believe she has a great ""eye"" for the world she sees, this book will not deter me from reading more from her because I thought the Liar's Club was one of the best books I have read in years. It is just that Cherry is not...."
5,A Brilliant Biography of a Poet's Life,"Right from the very first page of Cherry, Mary Karr will have you hooked. Anybody who has longed to escape a small town and see the world will be able to relate to Cherry. It is a close look into the seventies told from the point of view of someone who experienced it with the heart of a child and the mind of a woman. Karr writes in a way that only a great poet could. She develops the story with beautiful language that enables the reader to look at Karr's life and their own in a new light. Cherry is a sad, funny and beautiful story that will have you full of emotion at every page."
2,Memories in search of a story.,"I loved The Liar's Club, and anticipated an equally strong reaction to Mary Karr's second autobiography. However, this book never engaged me. Even though it was an autobiography, The Liar's Club had a clear plot and theme. This book does not. The first 70 pages read as a series of vignettes, with no coherent story emerging from the compilation. I finally gave up and didn't finish the book - a rarity for me. It's not that the writing was affirmatively bad. Karr's poetic prose is still very clever, and her ability to potently describe her characters is as strong as ever. I just never could get interested in the story."
2,sorry Mary!,"I loved, loved, loved THE LIAR'S CLUB so I could hardly wait to read CHERRY. However, I felt it missed the mark in a big way. Karr's writing wasn't quite as good, but more than that, her story didn't hit the mark in the same fine, but funky, fashion as THE L. CLUB. In fact, this book was almost disjointed as it followed her lousy teenage choices through some terribly uninteresting scenes. I just couldn't care... But perhaps Ms. Karr will come back to lead us on to California (hinted to at the onset of CHERRY) and back to some of her cutting-edge writing and just-plain-cutting memories."
5,Very Good Memoir,A fresh and poetic voice makes for an unconventional and engaging read. Karr's sense of detail serves as a mirror in which readers can find their own American coming of age stories.
1,The Big Whine,"I was trapped into reading this for a book club. My God, I thought it would never end. When it did, however, it was a tremendous relief to escape from Mary's self-centered adolescence -- like slipping off a shoe that tortures you. My advice: Resign from the club if you must, but don't subject yourself to ""Cherry."""
1,Born to be Riled,"If you want to spend hours with a self-centered, angry, conceited teenager, you've found the right book. Otherwise, your time would be better spent sorting your socks. Too much ""me"" in this memoir."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this thinking it would be a nice addition to our living room. It is a piece of junk. It is all partical board. The doors don't close. See those DVD's at the bottom of the door? You can't shut the doors if you have those there. All the holes are pre-drilled too. We put everything in it's place. The drawers are held together with glue slightly weaker than bubblegum. I would give zero stars, but I have to give at least one."
1,Garbage,"After a move I decided to ""upgrade"" my CD collection into a nicer, dust free cabinet.I saw this on-line and it looked great, had eough storage, was almost the perfect height so I could put it under the LCD and hide the cords behind it without dilling holes in the walls.I don't think I'll get any use out of it. Particle board would be bad enough, but the drawers are cardboard (this made them easy to shave so they fit together ""correctly""). Only white glue holds the drawers together. At least they supplied super glue for doors...I have no idea what I will do with this $270 pile of garbage, I am afraid to put my CD's in it."
5,A Very Good Introduction to Astronomy and Star Gazing,"OK, I'm a bit baised since George Keene is my father. Any way,this book is an introduction to the night sky, the use ofa telescope, and how to make a telescope. It is easy readingand explains rather complex ideas in a simple way.It is now a bit outdated but is a classic and a collectors item.Richard Keene"
4,One for the British blues rock fans,"Mick Martin and the Blues Rockers once again show why they are one of the premiere west coast blues rock bands. This fine tribute cd to the past masters of British blues rock is yet another example of their versatility. Covering songs by Jethro Tull, John Mayall, The Rolling Stones and Procol Harum to name a few, Mick and the boys inject new found energy and their own brand of blues into each and every song. Among the standouts are ""Ridin' on the L&N"", originally done by Mayall and Paul Butterfield, and knock em' dead redo""s of ""Whisky Train"" and ""I'm Your Kingpin"". If you haven't yet heard Mick and the Blues Rockers, this is as good a place to start as any. Mick Martin is truly one of the most gifted blues harp players going today and Tim Barnes guitar work is as good as it gets. So get ""goin' down the line"" and hookup with Mick Martin and his rockin' Blues Rockers."
2,Not worth the money,"This stroller has 3 major design flaws based on just one week of use. The largest problem I found was how the wheels are arranged. My feet kick the wheels when using the stroller in the carriage position. When using it in the upright sitting position the wheels do not interfere with my stride. Secondly, the cargo bag is placed too low. It rubs against the wheels when anything heaver than a diaper is placed inside. Thirdly, the wheels squeaked within first use. Given the cost of this stroller I would not recommend this stroller."
4,Yawara is a Must Have!!!,"I've heard good things about this anime and decided to buy it when it was on sale, I wasn't disappointed. Though some might think that a series about judo would be boring, it's definitely not. The interaction of the character's, Yawara's growing pains of trying to be a normal teenager while her stubborn grandfather makes her prepare to one day earn a gold medal at the Women's Judo competition in the Barcelona Olympics.One of the great thing about this boxset is the booklet that comes with the product, it explains the references and judo terms used throughout the series. I studied judo for a quarter at my university and I enjoyed hearing terms I learned during that time.I highly recommend this series, you'll be drawn in by the first few episodes."
2,Elegant?,"The reviewers said that this book's elegant prose sometimes overwhelmed and obscured its story. I happen to be a sucker for that kind of writing, where the real action is in the twists and modulations of the syntax. But in the end I was a bit disappointed by the book's prose, which is more Raymond Chandler than Raymond Carver. The book's characters and the things that happen to them are not very convincing, either. The arbitrariness of the plot reminded me of the novels of John Irving: if you can't give a character a rich interior life, then why not have her lose her hand in a bizarre accident and then raise her baby using a prosthesis?"
5,"Great, quiet stuff","This book has a nice leisurely yet disturbing pace to it- a lot like a David Lynch film. Not to give away too much of the simple plot, I found the main character's journey on the road to be frightening and beautiful. I honestly felt completely alone reading this book, even on the train."
5,LOCO!!,"Espantoso was my favorite radio station in GTA Vice City!This cd is a great collection of latin tunes,and DJ Pepe's my amigo!!"
3,It's missing a song!,"I was looking for a song on this CD that they played on Radio Espantoso, but for some reason, they didn't put in on the CD! What's even weirder is that THE SONG THEY LEFT OUT WAS THE SONG THEY PLAYED THE MOST OFTEN ON THIS STATION!"
4,the excellence continues,"i'm really surprised by the vehemence displayed by the reviewers who didn't like this disc. come on guys and gals, it's music not the end of the world. and what music it is. i loved ""blue horse"", but i really like this disc too. i love the new direction the music is going even as the artists cling to their blue grass/appalachia roots. how anyone can fail to notice that tracks 12-14 are too beautiful and beautifully performed is beyond me. listen to the samples. by the disc. enjoy the music. or not. either way, chill."
5,stunning,"i ran across the be good tanyas on the web a few weeks ago and downloaded a few tracks and thought they were gorgeous. i just got the album today and it is really beautiful. a wonderful instrumental balance and restrained-but-evocative vocals. once again, it's just really beautiful. if you like rickie lee jones, mary lou lord, emmylou harris, and the like, you'll most likely enjoy this."
3,"The So Good, Tanyas","They sound like Joanie Mitchell harmonizing with the McGarrigle Sisters backed by the Del McCoury band.I first heard the song ""Reuben"" on radio@netscape and was impressed by the excellent banjo, mandolin and vocals in a rendition of this classic traditional folk song. After a few listens, I bought the Album and it has become my #1 favorite - even inspiring me to write a review!The first song, ""Its not happening"" is about a person, like myself, missing much of life because they are always in a hurry - classic ADD behavior.Other favorites include ""Dog Song 2"" - a sweet song about burying a beloved dog and ""In spite of all the Damage"" - a poignant song of regret over destroying a relationship.These ladies are a major new talent that should appeal to a much wider audience. I am looking forward to seeing them in person as soon as Frazey is ready to get back on the road after having her child in May."
2,What did they say?,"I listened to the album the first time and didn't understand a word they sang. Same for the second time. The words are in the liner notes, but I'm not inspired to try to sort them out. The songs are too similar, and are generally unremarkable. The album was a disappointment."
2,"it,s just ok at best..",the music on this cd is nice in places..but the vocals to me are annoying..i bought this cd because of the reviews .was i ever disapointed..now i have a cd i will probably never listen to again
5,Chinatown,"Another excellent Be Good Tanyas album-by far my favorite group. Chinatown sounds more polished than blue horse, but in a way that adds to the overall experience. Same great vocals, same great banjo/guitar arrangements. Ship out on the sea is the early most played song for me, but they're all great. If you liked Blue Horse, you'll like this one. Norah Jones can't carry their guitar cases. If you haven't heard the Be Good Tanyas yet, buy them both."
5,Stellar 2nd album from the Be Good Tanyas,"This CD rarely leaves my CD player. It is a truly amazing, sophisticated follow-up to ""Blue Horse."" I could have done without the cover of ""House of the Rising Sun"" but other than that, this is a varied and beautiful album with stirring songs and incredible instrumentals. Alt-country, bluegrass and folk enthusiasts alike will love this one."
1,Not what I needed,"While this book is an in depth book concerning pathaology, it is not for the laymen like me. I was looking more for a book on COPD only as to symptons, causes, and treatments. Would you buy the book back from me and maybe refer me to the kind of book I need instead? I buy all my books from Amazon."
2,"Good when it works, but it died early","This little postage scale was great when it worked, but it only lasted for two years of very light duty. I probably weighed 2 or 3 letters or small packages per week during that time, so this item did not suffer from heavy use. If you want something more durable, look elsewhere."
1,Opposite of durable,"I bought one of these. After about 6 months, it died. Bought another, it refused to turn on, brought it to the store and got a different one that turned on. This one died in the same timeframe. Towards the end of their lives they both got rather inaccurate, off by as many as 4 oz! They may be cheap, but I'm never buying one of these again."
1,Warning Do not Buy this scale,I bought this scale primarily for weighing letters and small packages for my business. It did not work and I am disappointed. This failure has caused me many problems and inconveniences. DO NOT BUY!!
1,"Watch out--After battery change, error increased",The ex5 worked well until I changed the battery. Then it did the worst possible thing: it acted like it was working correctly but gave readings that were off by 10%. It was too little error to notice right away but enough to cause mischief. It took me weeks to figure out what was going on. I hate to knock a product but also nobody else should suffer with this.
2,Lasted for about a year,"My company purchased this scale about two years ago. At about the year point, variations in letter weight started happening depending on where I placed the envelope on the scale. At this point, the scale is nearly useless."
2,Only last about 1 year and i don't even use it that often.....Don't buy this item...,This scale is not reliable and will never buy this again....:(
1,Ours stopped working too,"We purchased this scale about a year ago and only used it a few times... really needed to weigh a package today and found that the LCD readout had gone out. Tried new batteries, but still will not work."
5,HP 16 in 1 Card reader,"The reader works fine with other than HP products, which is a plus. Vista regonized it right off. Can be mounted in either a 5 1/4 bay or a 3.5 bay. Another plus, if your motherboard doesn't have the USB pin header, a PCI card is uncluded."
1,Waste of Money,"Installed, worked for a few days and then each drive stopped working (one at a time). First to go was the USB drive. Not worth your time and money"
4,So HOT...,"I eat (what many would consider to be) a lot of spicy foods (including salsas, sauces, products, etc.). In my experience, this is a good hot sauce. In fact, I find it so spicy, it almost upsets my stomach enough to make me nauseous... in a good way."
5,"Well Done, Dr. Boice!","A good, comprehensive exegesis of the book of Nehemiah. Dr. Boice has done his due diligence in bringing this book to life, and making it so preachable. A solid source for preaching and teaching research. Chuck Dowell"
5,"My daughter loves her ""clip clops""","They're very sturdy and easy for her to keep on her feet, and she likes the fact that she can put them on and take them off herself. She hasn't had any blisters and the soles feel soft and cushy. I had to buy her a size larger than what she normally wears because they seem to run a little small, but other than that, we're very pleased with them."
5,Materia Medica by Boericke,"This is a very good if you are into homeopathic medicine. I've gone to a study group for years, and this is the bible for our group. As one of my daughter's are grown, I purachased this one for her to start her own family. My version was larger print, and I do like the larger print better."
4,Perfect for those that want to charge and play from the couch,"Worked well for me, as I was constantly running out of battery while playing, and was not able to continue with the tiny coird that comes with the PS3."
1,Useless,overpriced stuff...i mean it doesnt even look the same?!!!As for performance it just charges my controller..I was seriously hoping that it would charge my psp as well...and it does not...what a terible dissapointment
4,Works Well,"Charges like normal, only gripe is the cord is metal banded to ensure durability. This effectivly cuts down on flexability though. So when the cord isn't in use is very much so in the way. & When in use can interupt game play some. Necissary though if all 4 of your controllers are out of battery."
5,PS 3 controller charger,"This is just what I needed! It has a long length which allows for uninterrupted game play, even while laying on my bed or sitting at my computer chair. The cable is much longer than the included charging cable for my ps3 controller."
5,going the distance,"the cord i was given with my ps3 was too short to make it to my couch, this made gaming with a dead controller ingnorant. this cord is plenty long at 10 ft. it is braided and seems extremely durable. it comes with a velcro strap attached to the cord for windingit up. i highly recommend this product and was happy i purchased it."
1,Only a USB Cable,"Adding that this is only a long USB Cable, no different from any other aside form length. This product is heavily overpriced compared to other products which offer the same exact function. The added shielding does not make up for it's exuberant price."
2,UNNECESSARY COST!!! Read on for CHEAP alternatives!,"Alright first off this cable is highly unnecessary and if you purchase this solely for charging your PS3 controller then you are vastly overpaying.If you want a cheap alternative then you should just get this:Cables To Go 27005 USB 2.0 A to Mini-B Cable, Black (2 Meter/6.56 Feet)It is 1/3 the cost and does the same exact thing! If you need something even longer go withRiteAV - USB 2.0 A to Mini-B 5-pin Cable 15 ft.Don't overpay for something you don't have to! This is nothing more than a USB 2.0 A to Mini B cable!2 stars for being severely overpriced!"
2,Cheap,"I already had an Intec charging cable and thought from the pictures that this one would match it in appearance. Unfortunately it's pretty lame. It is both flimsy and stiff. It does charge just fine, but looks awful as it retains it's unattractive folded shape long after being stretched out."
4,its not bad,this cable lasts for a really long time i had this exact same cable before i had a short in it that wouldn't allow my cable to charge my controllers but as long as u keep the cable plugged in the controller at all times it seems to keep it charged and it won't develop a short in the cable but over all very good it lasts up to about 4 years if you don't twist and bind it not bad at all.the reason why i give it a 4 star my first one didn't last very long probably about 3 months
2,Wrong product!!,"I recently ordered my ps3 charging link from goHastings and they had really fast shipping but sent me the wrong cord, I am really upset that they are selling false advertisement."
1,This is just a USB A-B cable!,"This is nothing more than a USB A-B (5pin) cable that ships with many products these days, like digital cameras. You don't need to pay the extra money for someone to call it a ""charge link"". You can find a suitable cable for much less money."
2,Not As Advertised,"Warning, this item is not as advertised. The cables I received are from Nyko and are specifically for the PS3, but they do not have braided shielding. The cables I received are flat like a telephone cord and very cheap looking. They will be going back! Very disappointing."
5,Great extended PS3 charge cable,"Ive read some reviews saying ""this is just a USB cable"" implying that you can use any USB cable to charge your PS3 controller. While that is true, you cant charge and play at the same time with a standard USB cable. The controller will shut off if you try to charge and play at the same time. So you need one that is compatible with the PS3 which this one is. Highly recommended!"
4,Better than the original,I bought this because it's longer than the charge link that comes with the PS3 does the exact same just longer.
2,Fiskars needs improvement.,"I returned the first pair of these anvil pruners after realizing how poorly strengthened the blade handle is. While pruning small branches (1/8"") these pruners work fine. Ask them to cut larger diameter branches up to 3/8"" and the blade of the pruner misaligned with the anvil enough to cause the blade to pinch and grab the anvil as it attempts to cut. You end up with a blade that consistently wants to bend towards the left side of the anvil as you proceed to try and make a complete cut. I tried a second pair of these and they were just as bad. Needless to say, I don't recommend these based on the poor strength of the design.I purchased a pair of the Corona anvil clippers from Amazon (2 years ago) and they work perfect. They are well made and don't suffer from poor design.I still have them. They are keepers."
4,Not for the small handed,"The compound action on this pruner makes it really effective when cutting. It's easy to use on rose bushes and small pine branches. Just because the tree branch may fit within it's jaws, doesn't mean that you're going to be able to cut it easily, despite it's compound action (so, don't get overly zealous). It is pretty hefty for a pruner, but that is due to its heavy duty construction and materials. It appears well made and I hope that it'll last for many many years. I would not recommend this pruner for people with small hands because the grips/spacing is rather large and this pruner would be a lot less comfortable to use. As can be seen in the picture, there is a small switch to keep the pruner closed."
3,Fiskars 9110 Traditional Power-Lever Pruner,"Roughly made, and the lock-closed lever on the one I received is too long to set into notch - I used a nail-set and hammer to ""adjust"" it so it locks closed. The Corona Clipper 3/4-Inch Capacity Anvil Pruner With Vinyl Coated Steel Handles AP 3110 appears and feels much better made."
4,Fiskars 9110 traditional power lever anvil pruner,The handle sticks to lock the pruner closed. I tried to loosen the screw that holds the bar to slide it closed. I don't know if it will work. Still. I should not have to do that.No problem with the other instruments madeby Fiskars. I love Fiskars. I recommend Fiskars. I only use Fiskars. I was surprised at this little glitch. ( was it because it was made in China and not properly quality cotrolled?)
2,Not sharp for long,"I've hardly used it and already it's lost its sharpness, bending rather than cutting through stems. I am so disappointed. On the other hand, my friends pruned the apple and lemon trees, so maybe it did get a little bit of a workout, but still, I expected more longevity. I need a new and different pruner."
2,poorly constructed,"It cut well enough but would not lock until I filed down the mechanism. Obviously, it was never inspected after manufacture."
4,Nice for small pruning jobs,"I worked with this small pruner after it arrived in the mail to cut back vines and rose bushes. It's fairly easy on my aging hands and I had no trouble closing the jaws except on the oldest, hardest branches.I can't comment yet on longevity and wear, as I just got these. But, so far so good."
3,Cuts well but...,"Like another reviewer (Bill), I found it very difficult to lock and unlock. I had to force the mechanism hard with my thumb, and I have strong hands. Surprising, because Fiskar is supposedly noted for it's quality. Bill filed down the lock. Good idea."
2,overpriced,The same pruners can be purchased at Lowe's for about $10.00Also...the lifetime guarantee should be followed by a question mark because it isn't the case...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
5,love this Pruner,"THis pruner works well and fits both our hands. my husband has big hands and mine are small. it is very sharp,easy to use. Arrived promply and was well packaged."
3,"Quality film-making, but lacking content","Planet in Peril tries to address some very important and controversial topics that are relevant to Environmental Science,Ecology,and the later chapters in most current Biology texts. Topics centered around global warming are covered in a professional manner by the experts at CNN. It holds the students' interest due to personal stories shared by real people affected by the subject matter around the globe. The video lacks substance, however, and sound research from varied sources."
2,Expensive!,This is less a review for the show than for Amazon's ridiculous price. $29.95 for a show most people recorded? And about 90 mins.? Give me a break Amazon!
1,One star for crazy high price.,"Movie may be good, but the price is just crazy high. I can buy it on iTunes for four dollars. Thats not a typo either."
5,Great movie,"Little pricey but love the movie and what it portrays, think it could have been a little better, less hopping around but still love the content"
4,"Informative, straight forward, logical and easy to follow.","Blackjack: The Real Deal is right on the money! Its basic strategy section increased my understanding of the game and brought my winnings up an average of 30%. J. Phillip Vogel's style is easy to read, straight forward, logical and based on statistical facts, not luck or superstition. (Mathematics don't lie.) What's more, he covers casino etiquette, money management and other handy tips. I think quite a few gamblers could use this book, whether or not THEY think so. I see he is also coming out with a craps book that, personally, I can't wait to read!"
5,The perfect guide,"This is the only blackjack book needed. J. Phillip Vogel covers everything needed in order to beat the casino. He includes basic strategies, easy to read charts and even card counting. No gambler should play without reading this first."
1,bad techniques split 9's on A or 10?????? lol,"Sorry, but I'm suspicious this book was promoted by the casino's because it goes against black jack fundamentals. Go ahead and try it's strategy and you will lose."
2,Step Down for Jump Start Series,"After loving Jump Start 3rd and 4th Grades, I was very disappointed in Jump Start 5th Grade. It is difficult to navigate and some of the material is far beyond the knowledge of any 5th grader I know.To solve the Art History crossword puzzle you are supposed to go to the gallery and do research. But the gallery is so hard to use that my family usually resorts to randomly guessing letters in the puzzle rather than try it. As an educated adult, I don't even know more than one of four clues in the puzzles without research or guessing.If the other subjects were as unreasonable as Art History, I would have given an even lower rating."
1,Forget-About-It,"We have several JumpStart levels, and so I thought 5th grade would be okay, but I was wrong! It starts out with a looong cartoon intro. Then you are forced to go through a politically correct interview of a ""rat"" before you can start with a crossword puzzle that stopped us cold.One of the questions it asked in level one (the easiest) is who is (1548) the Venitian artist of the same town? So, we had to go through the ""museum"" of baroque art, look at every picture, read every description, and still didn't fine the answer!I took art history in college, not in the 5th grade! Now I can't even return the ...junk!"
1,"Poorly designed, way too frustrating","Despite good reviews for other JumpStart programs, the 5th grade one is very frustrating. The opening scene gives no guidance for what the child is supposed to do and the dialog between the two characters is way over their heads. My daughter was totally frustrated and lost all enthusiasm for trying this program."
1,The worst Jumpstart product made,"Our family has over 10 titles and 7 years of experience with Jumpstart products. Do NOT waste your money on this. My child spends more time navigating the product than learning. There is way too much emphasis on Art (defined only as painting). Finally, the geography content is fine but the globe doesn't move to get to the right answer/continent."
1,For Shame,"My wife has a Masters in Fine Arts from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. She could not complete the crossword puzzle in this STUPID 5th Grade Jump Start game. Hello, Jump Start people...what were you thinking? Educational software is supposed to make the learning process fun, not a source of complete frustration. Please pull this game off the market and retool it before you inflict it on any other poor unfortunate kids."
3,"Pretty to look at, but not too instructional...",The pictures were pretty. The overall design of the book is appealing. The photographs of different ways to wrap various items are beautiful and clear. But there's very limited instructions in the book. Only the last few pages contained gift wrapping instructions. The intructions were clear and included unique ideas on how to wrap a cylinder and book. The instructions also showed different ways to tie ribbons on gifts. There are gift decoration ideas for holidays like Mother's Day and has ideas on how to wrap gifts for men. The first few pages discusses the kind of gift wrap paper and decorative materials can be used for gifts. Overall the book book contains photographs that will inspire you on how to make your gifts beautiful and creative.
4,good book for GRE,I was recomended this book for GRE. Gives you some ideas on essay topics but not full proof. I purchased the used one and it was a good decision. The condition is good and delivery was within a week.
5,I'm the first?!?,"I just knew someone had beat me to the punch in reviewing this book.Check this out. Are you interested in taking over the world one block at a time? Are you interested in thinking out of the box in doing so (no pablum like ""we need to start our own businesses"" or ""we need to elect people we really really trust"")?Pick this book up. Trust me. I'm willing to bet that there is at least ONE social invention in this book that would change your life if you just tried it with a few friends."
2,embarrassed this ever happened in houston,"kent mcgowen was a bad cop and never should have been wearing a gun or carrying a badge. it's embarrassing to know this could have happened in my home city. equally so, i found the behavior of susan white to be just as disgusting. one of her neighbors was so correct when she aptly stated, ""she just wasn't country club material."" the title of this story should have been ""a warrant to be dysfunctional: a true story of an egotistical, addictive, drug enduced, out of control mother and wife."" the things susan did to herself, her child, her child's friends, her ex-husbands, boyfriends, and friends is unthinkable. in texas we call these people who behave like this ""white trailer trash."""
5,Excellent book! I got this on my kindle....,"I started to read this book, I remembered seeing this on one of the ""true crime"" shows a while back. Once I started reading, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! I could not put it down! Wanted to know what was going to happen next? If you like true crime books, Kathryn Casey is an excellent writer! This story has the ""thriller"" feeling from start to finish! Going to start reading ""Shattered"" today! Can't wait..the more Kathryn writes.....the more I will read!!!!!! Thanks Kathryn!"
2,Reads like a cut and paste job,"I agree with several other reviewers, this book just didn't connect. Although this story has merit, it reads like it was written in two different segments then pasted together in a bold attempt to fuse them together. It lacks the suttle forewarnings and blending characteristic of some many other good true crime writers. The characters are very strong and I think it could have been a better story if it was written with more suspense and flow. Better luck next time."
1,A Warrant To Kill,The perpetrator and victim's back ground were detail well by Casey. The story falls short on details of the interaction between the two. I was left wanting. The book read as if it was two novels that converge at the last possible moment. I was unable to connect with the character on any emotional level.
4,page-turner,"I'm a true crime fan, though I consider it more of a guilty pleasure than anything else since so many of these books are so tawdry and over the top. Warrant to Kill isn't going to win a Pulitzer Prize but it's an interesting book that keeps you engaged and wanting to know what happens next.Disclaimer: I grew up in the Houston neighborhood where this happened at the same time it happened and my parents still live a few streets away from that house. All of Susan White's old watering holes are all too familiar to me, from Del Frisco's to the Northgate Country Club. I was fairly young at the time she was killed, but after I finished the book I asked my parents about it and they said they didn't recall the case."
3,An incomplete work...,"I downloaded this book onto my kindle and found out that (1) There are no pictures and (2) The narrative is incomplete.I like Kathryn Casey's work, but I felt cheated after reading this book. So much has happened in the case since the book was finished and I believe that the author should have created an updated edition. Spoiler alert-This book ends with Kent McGowen free after his first conviction, but a cursory search on the internet shows that he was finally convicted and sentenced to 20 years and is currently incarcerated with his release date set for 2022.I don't understand why the author did not issue a new edition including that information. With the technology currently available, I would imagine it wouldn't be an insurmountable task.Therefore, although I like Ms. Casey's work, for the above mentioned reasons, I can not wholeheartedly recommend this book."
2,"Not the worst book, but not the best either.","This was not the worst book, but not the best true crime book I've read either. The story needs someone to organize the content in order to improve the flow. Very slow moving pace in parts. Even though it fell short, it was a good attempt."
3,An Okay True Crime Book,"I bought the package of this book, along with An Hour To Kill. A Warrant To Kill was an okay true crime book. The story was interesting and kept my attention. The writing, however, was flawed in that it left a lot of holes and did not tie in well with the central idea of this story. Who was the bad guy in thisbook? The Cop??? Or the Victim??? I would rate this book a 3 star. I just finished An Hour To Kill, which was an excellent read. I would rate this book a 5 star. But together they made one heck of an interesting weekend. Now, it is on to other stories."
4,Great book ..glad justice was finally served,"I knew he was guilty just by his arrogance alone ,but the two trials got him what he deserved in the end ...will be reading more of Katryn Casey's books."
5,A Warrent to kill,Well written..I had a hard time putting the book down as I became so into the story.It covered the characters to the point that you actually felt you knew them.Full of suspense to the very end.
3,could've been better.,"This was a fair book. Good story, wish it had been written by the likes of Ann Rule. More information and character dynamics was needed."
5,AMAZING!!,Kathryn Casey is awesome!! This is the second of her books that I have read and I can't wait to read more!
5,The Bible for Career Transition,"The 7 Keys to a Dream Job by Dilip Saraf is the bible for career transition whether you are a new graduate, been laid off from a job or are currently employed and looking to make a career change.The 7 keys approach takes you step by step through the career transition process helping you to develop your own unique selling proposition based upon who you are (not just what you did in the past) and what you want to achieve by leveraging your genius.Packed with information, exercises, practical how-tos, including developing a marketing plan, networking, interviewing and salary negotiation as well creating a powerful resume, with sample resumes and letters, this book has it all and will guide you through the realities and process of career transition, from self understanding to landing your dream job."
2,Here at Last: Bee Gees Live MP3,The music was good but the sound quality was not!I don't know if its a characteristic of MP3 or if it's because it's an older album.
4,Good movie but sad.,"A very good movie about a real lawman but a very sad ending. Sam Elliott does a very good job acting, but he's good in almost all of his movies."
2,"Good cast, lousy script","Sam Elliott's portrait of Marshal Tilghman is splendid as ever his performances as a westerner are. But the script is really lousy. After a thrilling start sequence and a surprising film-in-film-montage the film is lacking the necessary straightforwardness that, e.g., ""Last Stand at Saber River"" makes a 5-star-western. There's lot of talking and too little action. Best example: the scene when riding Tilghman is chased by a car with gangsters. The car simply crashes downward a hill. There's no thrilling tension in that sequence. The authors and director John Kent Harrison were not able to turn the conflict between old-fashioned lawman Tilghman and the modern, organised and law-protected crime into a entertaining duel. It's a pity: A lot of good ideas and a stunning Elliott performance wasted by uninspired filmmakers."
3,A Good Effort with a Great Western Actor,"Just who are our Old West heroes? Should they be vicious thugs like Jesse James? Lazy (albeit likeable) bums like Butch and Sundance? The outlaws get all the press but it was the folks like Tilghman who deserve our admiration. In recent years, some of the lawmen have gotten some credit; Wyatt Earp may or may not deserve admiration, but Tilghman certainly does. This film treats the last days of the last of the old west lawmen, a man whom Masterson called ""the best of us all"". Sam Elliott does a marvelous job of making Tilghman real; the movie, though, needs some work. I would love to see Hollywood apply some real muscle to the story of the Old West lawman, because Tilghman would be the best and only choice for a subject. Bring in Sam Elliott to reprise the role and let him really stretch his legs in this role. This movie though will serve until that happens. Watch this one and remember...this man was REAL and actually died with his boots on."
3,you know my name,"Most of the reviews of this movie say it has a lousy plot, what few critics probably realize,however, is that it is a true story (some liberties were taken of course.). I am Bill Tilghman's great-great granddaughter, and I had some problems with the story, too, mostly in what they chose to portray. I think that the early days of Bill Tilghman's life were much more interesting than the last few months. It's too bad they didn't focus more on the material in the ""Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws"" movie that Bill made with his partner, Benny Kent. Unless the audience knows a lot about Bill Tilghman, they wouldn't understand the ""flashback"" sequences. I also think Sam Elliott was mis-cast ! I have spoken to many living old-timers that knew Bill - they say he was a very unassuming and quiet man. He wasn't a tough guy at all. Still, I was glad the movie was made - many people never read history unless they've seen the movie first !"
3,Another fine acting job by Sam Elliot,Well done portrayl by Sam Elliot of noted law man Bill Tilghman. Gritty and realistic but less action than most of Sam's western films.
1,how to waste your time,Not much to say. This is a movie that we were unable to watch all the way through. It started slowly and went downhill from there. I'm sure the man's life was much more interesting than this movie!
4,"no shucks and by golly here, a real western","Once upon a time in Oklahoma there was a real lawman.In the 30's with the oil boom a new sort of criminalwas born who used the federal government to cover his crimes.Cleaning up one town for hire wasn't Dodge City orTombstone, but the old marshal came out of retirementat the request of the citizens of Cromwell.The streets of this town are truly muddy..."
3,You know my name??,"Not Sam's best movie. It was entertaining enough, just seemed over the edge with the guy chasing the bootleggers. You would think someone would inform Washington about a drug addict agent and a murderer! I would have put a bullet in the guy's head first thing and threw him down a well and got on with the movie on a different note.Its worth the money for some, I am a big Elliot fan, but not to excited about this one."
4,"It is a good movie, not great.","I really like Sam Elliott, especially his westerns. This is along the lines of a western but is slow and almost boring at times. I did like it but have seen better.Bob"
5,great for covering wounds or scars on face post-op,"To cover facial wounds or scars after the removal of skin cancers or other lesions, these strips do a great job of concealing. They are porous so air can get to the wound. They come off easily without pulling off scabs. I am glad to find quantities available less than 50!"
2,CD was scratched,I was totally dissatisfied with this product. I ripped the cd to my harddrive and then burned to a regular cd. It was just as worse. The merchant did grant me my money back. I will never purchase a used cd again.
5,Have you ever...,"...closed your eyes and imagined you were floating on a cloud? If not, purchase this CD, put it in your stereo and get ready for a ride to heaven. Stanley is so awesome! This CD demonstrates that Stanley is deliberate, concise and very thorough in his expression of music as it relates to films. The fullness of each composition fills your heart, mind and soul and leaves you hopeful that some day, someone will understand you and communicate your thoughts in some type of creative way. What a wonderful piece!"
3,PRETTY COOL MUSIC,"I only purchased this CD because of the PASSENGER 57 theme but I came to realize it also had the music from other films like POETIC JUSTICE & HIGHER LEARNING,the music is so soothing and relaxing as well like a jazz cd."
3,nightmare re-visited,"To me, only three people should take the blame on Vietnam. Jo McCarthy, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. McCarthy's witch-hunt created in the American psyche an unnatural and unrealistic fear and hatred for Communism. Jack Kennedy brought in and Lyndon Johnson kept inexperienced and naive men to conduct American foreign policy. These men, most notably Bundy and McNamara with their Harvard and Yale degrees and professorships fouled up American policy and got the U.S. into the longest and most disastrous war.Foreign policy should be run by experienced diplomats. Hopefully, this nightmare will never be repeated."
