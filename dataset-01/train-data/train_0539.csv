2,Disappointing,"This album has its moments;unfortunately they are too few and far between. Interesting riffs get repeated, almost relentlessly, until they become tedious. The vocals, while delivered with a great deal of enthusiasm, are delivered in the same style and often with the same syncopation, making each song similar. As a result this album plays longer than its actual length. Clearly there are those who like this album; for me, I expect to use it as a coaster."
3,mediocre,"Shadows Fall are obviously pretty talnted. Their lead guitarist, Jonathan Donais is awesome. The rest of the band is kind of mediocre. The vocals aren't that aggressive, the drums and bass dont stand out a lot. One of hte main issues I have with this album would be the production. It's produced like a hard rock album instead of metal. The guitars aren't pushed in the recording as much as they should be which makes this album sound like radio friendly metal-rock, which is really what Shadows fall are."
2,THE ART OF REHASH,"Did I just step into a time warp? It's fine and all to be into the old school metal. Hey I loved bands like Testiment and Anthrax back in the days, and dont forget the kings of metal...Iron Maiden! But trying to do what has been done by a million other bands before, and not as good, is just plain boring and just a rehash. Leave this type of metal in the 80s where it belongs."
2,Not as good as I was told,"First off the production is great. I just fail too see (or hear)all the hype with this band. I think the drummer is awesome but the guitar players are mediocre and stuck in 1988. They have all the clich√©' Zack Wylde squeals, Marty Friedman arpeggios and Scott Ian nothing new Anthrax style rhythm guitars. I just don't see why people are so impressed with these guys. The singer is your run of the mill average nothing-different voice shredder. Also I think Shadows fall is the absolute gayest name. Couldn't they think of something more original? It sounds like a bad horror film from the 70's. I will give this band one bit of praise, they are very tight and have a good groove, But original??? I don't think so. All their riffs are the same. Is this the direction Metal is going??? Ah..... I think it's already been there. Just a tuned a little higher."
4,amazing,Some of Shadows Fall's best work. As a band they have grown since the release of Of One Blood. This album goes from metal to thrash to rock with out being lame it may take some time to get use to this new cd but it is definitly worth it. Art of Balance will be one of those albums that you will keep going back to and enjoying it more and more everytime. You may say why did they cover Pink Floyd but just listen to it . The Floyd cover is increadable it sounds as if Pink Floyd and Metalica had a baby and named it Shadows Fall. PICK UP THIS DISK IT IS WORTH IT
4,New school with a dash of old school spice,"If you crave the classic metal sound but can't give up your new school crunch, growl and thrash, you MUST buy this album. If your not bangin' your head by the end of the first track, check yourself into the morgue because your dead.The only thing that I didn't like was the instrumentals of which there are two - one reminded me too much of that Ozzy and Lita Ford song - Yikes!However, there is a fantastic cover of Pink Floyd's ""Welcome to the Machine."""
4,Americans still know how to make metal!,"Century Media has the reputation of signing some of the best artists in metal, but also some of the worst. Fortunately, Shadows Fall is in the former category, and this album proves that metal has not left the United States just yet. With noticeable influences from In Flames and other 'Gothenborg sound' metal acts, it's a given that these guys will be good. The cover of ""Welcome To The Machine"" is the standout track, although the title track and ""The Idiot Box"" are good as well. Truthfully, most of the material on this album is great, and I'll be investing in more of Shadows Fall's products soon."
4,I just dont know.......,good sh*t that always finds its way into my cd player. Good cd and you get a dvd with it....what more could you ask for?
3,Average Shadows Fall,"This album is usually heralded as Shadows Fall's best (actually Of One Blood) and most complete (actually The War Within), but this falls short in that it sounds like a thrash compilation. There are too many influences dominating this album to make it exciting or cohesive. There are some great songs (The Mystery of One Spirit, A Fire in Babylon, Stepping Outside the Circle), but overall it seems like at an attempt at greatness that just does not get there. Of One Blood was that acheivement, and the follow-up to greatness is found in The War Within."
1,I can't begin to explain how boring this is.,"Shadows Fall includes a pseudo-thrash element within their typical metal release. With little musical talent and poor vocals this album is one to stay away from. There is absolutely nothing of value to benifit from this release as it's watered down pseudo-mall metal. Even the semi-decent track, Destroyer of Senses was repetitive and compressed in the overall duration of this release."
3,Too much 80's metal influence,I bought this CD based on how much I liked their new videos in rotation on Headbangers Ball and was somewhat disappointed by the rest of the songs. Way too many 80's metal guitar solo's and at least 3 entire songs of classic metal guitar performances with no vocals....too much Yngwie Malmsteen influence. There are 3-4 really good heavy songs on this album....get the MP3's from a friend if you can. The extra disc with live vids was pretty cool though cuz they are of the good songs on the album.
3,Nice Book--A Little Disappointing,"This well written and prettily presented book covers a lot of Irish golf courses. The authors have done their homework, there is plenty of useful information and the book would be a helpful companion in planning or taking a trip. Somehow, however, they seem to have missed conveying the idioysyncratic nature of Irish golf. Perhaps this is because each description of each course is identically laid out, and the course descriptions sometimes lapse into the generic. A well done and useful book but not a golf aphrodisiac like, say, Hamilton's ""Great Golf Guide to Scotland."""
1,A complete bust for me,"I bought this to remove the rust on my bicycles, for example on the quick release handles and some of the bolts. It didn't do a thing to remove the rust. I tried leaving it on longer, I tried utilizing it in conjunction with a wire scrub brush, I tried using it more than once...but got zip, zilch, nada in terms of even removing a little rust."
2,not what I expected!!!!,"tried and not satisfied at all, i use the product for my car and did not do squat. i guess this is just for home use or something."
2,I would not buy again.,I tried it and it works about 10% of the time. I am going to look for a gel product that will stay on the rusty nail heads instead of just running off.
1,HUGE WASTE OF $$$... only 25 min and you may never want to see a woman again,"Personally i think Amazon should remove this from its site. We bought it with the intention of learning something and turned it off wondering how in the world someone thought this was one informative and two that they could make $ selling it. After this, I wanted to quit my job and start making intamacy videos; a naive couple with home movie camera could do better."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"I gave the DVD ""Pleasures of a Woman in Orgasm - Elle"" 1 star but if I could I would give it a big fat round ZERO. I bought it because of the reviews but it's now obvious to me that they are fake. Don't believe the hype and don't purchase anything from this company."
1,Terrible. Do NOT Buy this DVD.,This video only lasts 33 minutes and has only one angle. This is not at all an educational video. A definite waste of time and money.
1,Look Elsewhere...It's not for you.,"This DVD, although being produced with taste and a respect for the subject matter is mind numbingly boring. Far to little information on technique, no suggestions or demonstrations for variety and one dimensional camera work. I can not recommend this video to anyone, even a beginner."
2,every woman's orgasms is fairly similar,"I found some of these orgasms rather blase. Ridicule me if you like, but I've been an active participant in countless female orgasms, and can therefore speak with utmost authority on the subject. Depite my jaded outlook, I recently encountered an orgasm which caused me to stand up and take alarm. It involved a douche composed of pea soup - and forgive me for being frank - but it really produced a remarkable effect. I am despondant that the filmmakers decided to abstain from a more experimental approach such as occured in the genesis of this aforementioned orgasm. I hope that any upcoming additions to this series will choose to explore the medium of female masturbation, rather than defer to such a conservative approach."
1,This is an absolute waste of money,"I can't believe I spent $30 on this DVD. It shows 30 minutes of the same stroke over and over. There is no instructional value at all. I had to rewind many times because I couldn't even tell that she actually had an orgasm. Even though I rewound the tape a few times, I'm still not even sure she had one. This video could have been condensed into 1 minute and it would have had the same content. You're better off buying something else. Don't waste your money!"
2,nothing new,"Based on the other reviews I thought it would be ground breaking ""secrets"" but frankly it was just an extended video with a women using one finger to rub her clitoris. No real insight or helpful instruction. If you need a video to let you know where the clitoris is located, you would be better off just looking it up in a medical text. For the voyeurs who want to watch the women touch herself, this is your video. If you are looking for some real instruction on increasing your sexual acumen and technique, you should look elsewhere."
1,Disappointed,"This is basically a long DVD of a woman giving herself an orgasm, so if watching is your thing, then you are likely to enjoy this DVD. However, if you are looking for some education and insight beyond clitoris 101, you won't get it. Some real insights and comments from a woman about her orgasm, how significant and what technique, some demonstration would be really good. Its true that if you watch this repeatedly, and if your TV has good enough resolution, you may pick up the subtle clues a woman gives about the state of her orgasm. But a partner, or indeed a woman on her own, would have difficulty improving their technique. Very disappointing as an educational aid."
1,Hohum,"Ummmm, incredible how BORING an orgasm can be! If she ever actually came at all, which I find debatable. She seemed to just prolong the pre-orgasmic state for half an hour and then smile and wipe herself off. And....THAT'S IT!"
2,I am a dissatisfied reviewer,This video lasted only 33 minutes and contained but one example. I expected much more for my money.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"Let me tell you right off the bat. If I could rate this DVD any lower I would. All those 5 star ratings are bogus and are most likely written by 'The Welcomed Consensus.' This video has only an outline of the vagina, and 1 (only 1!!!) technique of masturbation which last for about 30 minutes. I would strongly urge you not to buy this product because you will only be a waste of your time and money. I would not buy any products from 'The Weclomed Consensus.' This is not an instructional video. It is only a woman pleasuring herself for an absurd amount of time with no real helpful information."
1,Not very enlightening,"I expected more given the 5 star reviews. There is no instruction, just a quick over view of the parts of the vaginathen 30 minutes of watching an attractive woman rubbing her clit very lightly. If you have never seen a vagina then this has about 5 minutes of content and the rest is pretty much a waste. I would like to give it 1/2 star."
1,should have kept my mony,"I too bought this DVD due to the reviews,wow what a waste of money. IT was like whatching a bad porno star,I dont see how this DVD could help anyone with there sex life."
2,Ewww!!!,"The video is instructional and erotic, buuuuutttt...The ""performer"" is attractive enough. She enters the bedroom set in a negligee, and you think, ""Nice breasts. I look forward to seeing them when she is nude"". Well, no such luck, pal. She gets in the bed, and hikes up the nightee, and you never see them.What you do see, is not pretty. Now, I love women's bodies, but this one... Her vagina is one of the least attractive I have ever seen. And, the balloon knot looks like a cat's. Seriously, not pretty."
1,Wish they had a money back guaranty,I bought this CD and Female Masturbation - Clitoris: The Key to a Woman's Pleasure. In reading the existing reviews I was excited to get the DVDs in hopes they would provide new information that I could use to enhance my girlfriends sexual satisfaction. What I saw was 20 minutes of one women masturbating with no instructional value at ALL. I would be embarrassed to show these to my girlfriend.If they had a money back guaranty I would send them back today.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY as I did!!!!!
3,A Perplexing Book,"This is the story of a courageous and well educated woman and the death of her world - and of her husband. It is well written and ties in well with other writings about the barbarous behaviour of the Russians when they invaded Germany.However, Frau Horstmann is lamenting the passing of her class, the Prussian nobility and aristocracy. She draws parallels with the French revolution. She rarely mentions Hitler, though she leaves it quite clear that she regards the Nazis as her social inferiors.She portrays the Germans as a civilised European nation, unlike the Russians who she describes as ""Asians"". But hold on....wasn't it the Germans who invaded eastern Europe (not least Russia) with such brutality; and who gassed millions of Jews? Life was hard for the Horstmanns under the Russians. It was a lot harder for the Jews under the Germans. But like Hitler, they hardly get a mention.As I say, a perplexing book."
3,DrumSet,I love this drum so much and it is a good price because in other stores they have the same size of drums and it's much more expensive. I always wanted to play the drums so I think this is excellent.
4,cool drum set!!,"I`m 12 and I love this set. I can play pretty hard for my age. The set holds up fine. The seat is really, really soft and comfortable. I think it is a good set. Pretty easy to assemble too."
5,Chamilitary,"Overall this is a great mixtape, chamillionaire is definetly gonna blow this summer when the sound of revenge drops, and if you dont got the mixtape messiah by now you should cop that album asap"
5,Developmental disabilities and learning come together!,"I just want the folks at Special Kids Learning Resource Network to know how wonderful you are! Our son Michael LOVES your programs.Although I do homeschooling, Michael feels he needs to be ""in school"" too, so he watches the programs, does coloring, writing, and lots of other school things you show. Keep up the good work!"
4,Meets my needs,Installing my SATA hard drive in this enclosure was a breeze. The on/off switch and USB/Firewire ports are convenient and the enclosure does not make alot of noise while running. I was disappointed that the Fireware connection does not recognize a hard dirve partition any larger than 120 GB.
5,Works perfect....,"I bought this unit to add a sony blu-ray drive to my PC - it works as advertised. The price could have been better but with Amazon Prime shipping it is almost the same as buying from other sources.The enclosure is heavy, built very solid, and a pleasure to work with.The color may be out of place, unless you dont mind contrast to a beige or black box pc. I personally use this on a MAC pro running Vista x64 and it works perfect...looks perfect too.The box includes what you need to get started, although documentation could be better. More then likely, the users buying this item wont need too much in the way of documentation because upon opening it, it is self explanatory."
1,Shameless Hilton self-aggrandizement--an emetic in the form of a book,"Okay, well, I claimed this book was an emetic in the book title, but actually it is so much more than that: a somnolence aid, and the ultimate in posthumous self-aggrandizing ego stroking. Better yet, if you want to lower your libido and numb your soul, read this book!P.S. The Hilton San Francisco suuuuuuucks!!!!!!"
3,OK but too many typos!,"I thought this box set of study cards was helpful but I wonder whether the publisher bothered to hire copy editors. The cards start out okay, but as you progress, there are more and more glaring typos. After a while, I was so distracted, I had to correct them in order to understand them."
2,not a brand new Samsung Cartridge,I spent $65 to buy the Samsung Cartridge. It turned out this is a rebuilt Samsung Cartridge. The box is a real Samsung box. But the cartridge was a rebuilt Samsung cartridge. I sure can get a rebuilt Samsung cartridge for about $30. This is a misleading product. Be careful!
1,Not what they said it was.,"This product was not what they said it was. The product I thought I was purchasing was an actual Samsung toner cartridge. It did not say ""compatible toner cartridge"". Right on the box that they shipped it says compatible toner cartridge. What they said I was getting is not what I got. I won't ever purchase from them again."
5,As expected for an OEM cartridge,"I'd tried some of the 'aftermarket' toner cartridges, but what I saved in cost, I lost in performance. Best price going for the OEM cartridge."
5,Toner/Cartridge,"This product has/is serving me very well. This is the first time I've purchased this product on line. My normal purchase is from a brick & mortar store, which at this time will be unnamed. This particular Samsung toner/cartridge works just as well or better than the one that I have been paying $90.00 for. With this one I saved over $30.00"
5,GOOD PRODUCT GOOD PRICE,Thank you for a good product - good price - speedy service - no problemsI recommend this vendor
4,Go with the Samsung!,"I first tried a no-name, compatible cartridge from a different source. It was about $20 less, but it didn't work. It made a horrible sound as the gears on the rollers skipped and jammed. So, I ordered the original Samsung replacement cartridge from Amazon, and now everything works great! Be careful of a cheap knock-off, it could do serious damage to the moving parts in the printer."
3,"Works, but...","...Installation of this toner cartridge does not turn off my low toner light. I cannot find anything online or in my electronic documentation that tells me how to do this manually. Requests to Samsung go unanswered. This causes a note to constantly pop-up in my SPL driver. A minor annoyance, but it shouldn't be there with a brand new SAMSUNG cartridge."
1,There are much cheaper options!,"This is a ripoff... the price is exceedingly high, especially for one that isn't even made by Samsung. If you're looking for a cheap alternative to buying an authentic Samsung cartridge (around $120), I would suggest this:Laser Tek Services Toner Refill Kit 3 Pack Compatible with Samsung ML 2010 ML-2510 ML2010D3 Dell 1100Only $25 for three refills that last a long time!"
3,samsung toner,I did not see it originally said open box so when I wrote the review I was disappointed but the ad did say open box and I just didn't see it. Rosemary
5,good,Works as expected. Toner is clear and dark. Past experience has shown that it has a lot of capacity. I probably go 2 yrs w/ this cartridge.
5,Works Great,Works great. We use this for a small home office. Our last one lasted us two-and-a-half years.
1,NOT a Samsun ML-2010 - MISLEADING ADVERTISING,"This is advertised as a Samsung ML-2010D OEM toner cartridge. OEM means manufactured by the original manufacture. It does not say ""compatible"" in the advertisement.This was offered by Unbeatable Sales Inc. (not Amazon)It is in reality a LD-2010UNIV. I brought 2 and could of saved $25 by buying it elsewhere IF I WANTED a ""compatible"" cartridge. I've had bad luck in the past with non-OEM cartidges and chose this because it was a good price for the Samsung cartridge.BUYER BEWARE of UNBEATABLESALE"
1,REALLY BAD DELIVERY SERVICE,"This product took almost 2 weeks to get delivered even though it was listed as being ""IN STOCK"". The savings was not enough to make it worth while. I do not recommend you purchase this product. Just go to your local office supply store and pick one up!"
3,dyson slim vacum,"Overall it's fine, not quite up to the New York Times reviewers description. Erratic suction but lightweightand very portable.More suction than a dustbuster although the emptying the bag feature means the cannister always looks dusty so you wnend up spending more time trying to make it look less filthy .Although the fact its clear or at least opague aftet the frst time you empty it - that windoww does let you know when to empty it. So far, unsuccessfully. (Until i met the DysonSlim, I must say i had nevr thought much about cleaning the interior of my vaccum. basically iup until now i concentrated on vaccuming the floor, rugs and upholtry and blinds.On the other once you figure out it's numerous iodiosyncrictic subtleties its got co pact nature makes it a good investment for a small aprtment. i ended up ordering the overpriced mattress attachement as well."
3,Not really what I was expecting,Probably not the fault of the seller - I guess I either didn't read the description right or did not understand what I was reading. I purchased this thinking it was a complete replay of the superbowl game. It is actually snippets of the game and interviews. My husband did enjoy watching that but was dissapointed that it wasn't what we had hoped it was.
2,Poorly done!,"Waste of time and money. Pretends like it's going to tell you how to set up a 3d graphics engine and does no such thing. There's a little matrix math at the end of chaper 4 pretending to be a 3d manipulator BUT THERE'S NO CORRESPONDING CODE ON THE CD! The OTHER chapters have their code on the CD, but not this one. It makes me wonder if this one little bit of seemingly honest 3d code ever actually even worked. The matrix equations on pages 142 and 143 are totally screwed up like a proofreader never even LOOKED at the thing. Whole rest of the book is a pointless rehash of how to use Flash, Swift, Plasma and stuff you could get out of the respective user's manuals."
3,Collection Sheets Over-Priced,"I have used the Silent Air for several years, but became disallusioned due the the high price for the collection sheets. Add it up. In 5 years you will spend over $200 on replacement sheets. The unit does leave blackness on the wall or anything behind it. It is time consuming cleaning it monthly. Compare other units on the market, for instance Eco-Quest who sells a unit with a washable filter that doesn't leave blackness behind it."
5,Well Done,"This is a great CD for anybody who likes Outlaw Country. Real music, real singers, just a great album!"
5,The Highwaymen The Road Goes on Forever(DVD Included),"Excellent. So glad I purchased this. Awesome to watch these guys together in the studio, plus perform. Now that two of them are gone, Waylon(my fave) an Johnny, it is so great to just watch them how in sync they were together. Must have for your collection!!"
3,"Not Great, But Okay","The music is okay, the arrangements are acceptable. But, considering the big name performers involved, the package as a whole is disappointing.The Road Goes on Forever"
3,The over-the-hill-gang stikes out.,"I had high hopes after reading the Amazon review, but I thought the disc was draggy and dull with the exception of KK's song. These guys should have listened to ""The Traveling Wilburys"" to get some hints on how to make magic TOGETHER."
1,Whoa - This is BAD,"Jeez! i mean, good lord! i cannot convey just how awfully trite and contrived and utterly BAD this CD is. The lyrics, the drums, the guitar ... ALL BAD.Sorry, dude, find another line of work."
4,very good!!!!!!,"You see, most people read a book and try to find some deep meaning to it. This is one book that you can't do that! I have read this book and yes, there are flaws, but hey, it happens. This book is entertaining and has exciting parts to it. It will take awhile to get into it, but once you start, man, you can't put it down."
3,Leds are the best for solar,"Hooked these to my 100 watt inverter and run them off the solar.Very nice soft white, some inconsistancies in the white color."
4,Look good like warm white should,Was concerned mainly about them being warm white as noted and they look good like warm white should. Hoping for a lower electric bill this year.
3,Not a favorite,I was just disappointed in this CD......the music itself isnot a favorite. Is okay as background music and theartist is talented.....just not my favorite choice of music.
5,Sounds of Spring,Looking for a superb collection of music for spring? Enjoy the music and relax! Great price for a great product.
2,Smash Flops,"I thought this was a copy of the original Smash Flops that was published in the early 60s. It had the same cover picture, so I thought it was the same.It wasn't. Instead of melodious voices, it has a group of high-pitched voices. There is some profanity that was not present on the original album. Some of the songs have been re-written, and some were completely replaced by others that were not enjoyable at all.So I gave my new copy away."
1,"Save your money, get the same tips on-line for free","Although the book is well planned, the information is dated and limited. Save yourself $8.00 and obtain current in-depth information for free on-line at numerous financial sites."
3,"Reasonable for the price, with issues","This is a hardy light, with good illumination, however the hinge mechanism is faulty/non-funtional and requires a 2x4 block to hold it steady, and the power cord should be a LOT longer."
3,Parts Missing,The light part of this is great and the spare bulb is a major plus however the most important piece to properly stand the light is missing.
1,Very archaic and sexist,Thank God it was free. The views on the roles and responsibilities of women are very outdated. Would not recommend book at all
1,Silver Bracelet,The black onyx bead at the end came off after wearing just a few times. Not worth it.
4,Recommended read,"I read an earlier (1970-something?) publication of this work, and really enjoyed it. The sisters were presented as powerful thinkers who struggled with the issues of their day. The title is right on, they were pioneers for women's rights, as well as influential abolitionists. I'm glad that they were presented as whole people, with doubts and questions and problems, too.It was an easy ready, but I didn't feel like the author was talking down to me. The book is highly recommended."
5,The best bra ever!,"This is the most comfortable bra I've found, especially for any woman with a small, average bosom. It's very feminine and pretty. It gives support without wires (which I don't like or really need) and even gives cleavage. I was pleased to find it on Amazon as our Macy's stopped carrying it (after getting me hooked on it!) And even available in 4 different colors! Whoopee!"
2,Runs out of ink too fast,This product runs out of ink incredibly fast. When I first got the pen as a gift I thought there was something wrong with those refills. I talked to Cross and they sent me replacement refills at no cost. Those ran out quickly also. i like the pen so much that I continue to use it even though the ink cartridges suck
4,Smooth and Long-Lasting--On the Right Paper,"On quality paper (for example, what you find in a genuine Moleskine notebook, and not one of the knockoffs), these refills last and last, and the ink flows steadily, smoothly, effortlessly across the page.On cheaper, coarser paper, the tips can get clogged. You won't see anything, but it just stops writing. You may even believe you have run out of ink. But if you clean off the tip and switch to better paper, it will write again.You have a nice pen. Get nice paper, too. It will make your pen--and you--happier."
1,Save Money,After only 4 days of writing for about 10 minutes a day one of the refills is dry. Save your money.
1,Does not fit in my pen,"This does not fit in my Cross pen. I have the sterling silver pen purchased in the late 1980s. The tip does not fit in properly to be exposed and thus I cannot write with this refill. When comparing it to what I am replacing: they are the same length, the same general shape, etc. But this refill has an additional plastic piece towards the tip that prevents it from being properly loaded into the pen. The plastic is not shown in the Amazon photo. Does that piece come off, if I try, will it leak all over me? Instructions may help. I'll try to call Cross and find out. Until then, I do not recommend anyone buys this refill. I will update this if I get the refill to fit in my pen."
4,Sizes Run Small,Good quality windbreaker... but sizes run too small. Buy one size up and you should be fine...
2,someone napped on Panasonic's refurb. assembly line,"purchased a refurb. 2-line phone, but was not wired properly - the 'line 1/2' modular phone line port contained only 2 wires, not the 4 required to have 2-line use. unfortunately, I needed to use the phone immediately and had no time to wait for an exchange, so I used an adapter and plugged line 1 and line 2 in separately. it works fine, but I shouldn't have had to go to the electronics store to fix it."
1,So so.,"I was looking for a coreded phone that I could plug my standard headset into. I went to Staples to see which phones had this capability, and the Panasonic KX-TSC14B did, and at a reasonable price. Please note that I did not require a 2-line phone; it seems that all phones with a headset jack (at least at Staples) were 2-line phones.I purchased the phone and was disappointed. For some reason it made my headset sound very hollow. As the previous reviewer noted, there is no mute button -- I guess I should have realized that sooner. The other annoying ""feature"" was if I had the headset plugged in, the calls were always routed to the headset; even when I picked up the handset! I could not figure out how to change this behavior.I returned the phone and started my search again. I found a company that makes great Home Office phones... Aastra. I HIGHLY recommend their phones... or at least the PT-470 which I wound up purchasing. They also make 2-line phones. Do a Google search for ""Aastra""."
3,It works,"Not a lot to say about a gender changer. It either works or it doesn't, and mine did. Decent materials and construction, but nothing outstanding."
2,"It works, but:",I put it at the end of a cable needing a gender change. It seriously degraded the video quality. I'd just buy a new cable next time.
4,a long-ago favorite,I read this book in jr. high and I loved it because it was different from the average teen romance. I would love to find a copy of it somewhere.
5,LOOOOOOVE,"I Love Sheila Walsh. This book is simple, gentle, but still a good challenge for the way I think about what it means to heal. I love how she focus' on God's Word for the ultimate truth."
4,Great Book!,"I honestly never finished this book, but the part I did read and work through (questions, etc.), was absolutely wonderful! As I went on a retreat, I had forgotten this book, so I read and journaled through ""The Wounded Woman"" instead, and that was the book God usesd to help me overcome my ""victim mentality"". I believe this one would have worked just as well."
4,sentimenal/year/ago/alone,The sound quality and/or the items to fill the space on the CD lacks the punch as other CDs and the DVD by a great artist.
4,Good for the price,"I bought this about a month ago. We put it together rather quickly and easily. I've used it quite a bit and really like it. The way to do the exercises on the Weider Max takes some getting used to, but once you've accomplished the shift, it's great. I don't get the best workouts on my chest and back, but that's probably because I'm still getting used to the feel of the machine. I think it's going to work great for me....it has so far!"
1,save your cash.,I cant beleive people buy this junk. You'l never get great muscle mass using one of these machines. You'd be better off spending your cash buying a power rack and some free weights. Free weight excercise stimulates more muscles.
4,Home gym,"Gym is working great, easy to use, work most muscle groups, seems to be quality built for the price.Issues - 4 nuts missing in install kit and the bench is wobbly when laying flat"
2,Tired,Nothing like the stuff he did in the 30s and 40s. This is from the 70s and sounds all rather dopey and sentimental with hardly anything left of the swing of old.
2,Nothing,"I used this product, twice a day, every day, for 71 days. No noticable change in wrinkes or under eye puffiness."
3,Great But.....,SO I ordered the platter. After a delay it did arrive. It arrived in good shape. It is not made in England as the description says. Rather the label says made in Indonesia.
5,"Exciting and fabulous, technically sound, every page counts.",Stanley Roderick Deans shows us radon transforms like never before seen. This is quite a technically sound spell-bounding book. I have found every page to be useful. I even often go through it again and again on a daily basis. Quite a stunning techinical achievement. A must read for anyone serious about the study of mathematics.
2,Not a good choice for overclocking,Do not buy this mobo if you plan on overclocking your system. There is an issue with this particular model that causes some of them to reset to factory settings if any sort of external USB storage is plugged in upon start up.
3,"Good board for beginners, terrible lifespan, aging chipset","This board was great when I first built a desktop. The chipset was a good combo for low-speed emulated disk access, thanks to the cheap ICH8 chipset, and the P965 was decent for dual channel RAM. The board overclocked well, and lasted for a while. My board died after 1 year, and left me in the dust, because it was out of warranty, and the board is no longer manufactured to revision 1.0 specs. The board will be great for n00bs, but the P35 or G35 chipsets would be a better buy."
2,Mine Died after about 4 years,Worked ok for the first 4 years. Then died. Always had problems with the sound and the IDE interface. Had to use SATA.
2,"This is too old, anymore.","Forget these old chipset motherboards, and get something, w/ no onboard graphics, and put a video card in there (one of your choosing.) You will be glad u did. Not recommended, this old 965 intel chipset. (boo.)"
4,Good Set,"bringing together the Bonus stuff makes this a Good Set.George Michael is Very Underrated as a Artist but He has made some Great Stuff Over The Years.""FastLove"" both Versions are tight.the Guy is a Very Talented Vocalist&Writer.this Project showcases His Artistic Growth."
1,Monsterous,"This is the kind of band that you like to listen to. Studio tight.But I've seen them live, and they sound the same.This is the best group of artists I've personally ever seen, with the not-cast-in-stone exemption of the Pontiac Brothers.This CD represents the first of their works. It does justice to their appreciation of different venues of music. They can do what they want musically, and show you.While this CD is certainly worth getting, you simply HAVE to hear their rap song- ""dissin' ma groopae."""
5,Book of many delights,"Good to read if you are sick or sad: love on every page. Daniel Pinkwater is sane, kind, naughty, and of course uncommonly funny."
5,Hilarious! A classic.,"Before David Sedaris, Jenny Lawson, or Calvin Trillin (okay, maybe not before Calvin Trillin) there was Daniel Pinkwater.Eat pudding."
3,"Too wide and cannot adjust, won't bend","Nice watch, but is stiff and is too wide for my wrist. Jewelor not able to adjust."
5,They still do make 'em like they use to!!!,This is just plain out loads of fun.Buy it and love it! Has a great commentary by Director Jim Stramel and star George Archer.I've seen this about 10 times and it just gets better.Treat yourself to this gem now - you've already waited too long!!!Grab it and kick back with a few beers and a few friends.You will not be disappointed!!!
1,Do yourself a favor...,"If you INSIST on watching this, may I suggest the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version? It actually makes this bedpan of wizard wiz bearable."
3,It's a good kids film.,"Direct to video, with a starring cast of David Warner, David Warner, David Kriegel, Brigid Conley Walsh,and Corbin Allred (also in Diamonds (1999).The quest is to at first stop David Warner from killing David Warner. David Warner is the good guy and he isn't, that is, he has duel roles. The Quest is to find the lost store house filled with all sorts of neat stuff. Note: the rip-off music from ""Empire of the Sun"" by John Williams, at the beginning of the film.Other then that; it's an okay little movie, and I think yourkids might enjoy it. You might also like it, if you are able to laugh at badly made movies."
3,Living Oblivious,"There are some tracks on this disk that (thankfully) I had never heard of. However, there are a few songs here that are very difficult to find.Belly of the Whale - Burning Sensations. In fact it was for this one song that I bought the CD.Get out of London - Intaferon. As previously mentioned this is a hard song to locate.Also, WangChung, Tones on Tail and the Thompson Twins add to the value of this disc (for me at least.)"
4,"Some gems, some better forgotten","As with any compilation, some tracks you already have, some you want, and some you don't really care for. The selling point for me was the inclusion of Intaferon's 'Get Out Of London' - REALLY hard to find on CD - and I'd rather get it on this for a handful of bucks than on the Olsen twins' Winning London soundtrack for maybe 3 times the price."
2,The Worst in the Series,"Living In Oblivion, Vol. 4, contains three notably great selections: ""Mexican Radio"", ""Under the Milky Way"", and ""Belly of the Whale"". The rest of the songs are either monster hits that can be found anywhere (i.e. Spandau Ballet's ""True"", ""Come On Eileen"" by Dexy's Midnight Runners) or unknown songs that are obscure for a reason. The compliation team seems to have gotten lazy here and the disc is unsatisfying as a result. Avoid unless you just want to get the whole set."
1,R-R-Rotten,"What a disappointment! This bone markets itself as a ""really rugged"" toy. Literally within 30 seconds my English Bulldog not only had chewed it to pieces but she also had ingested some of it. This is a dangerous toy! Ingesting plastic of any kind is not good for dogs. And speaking of plastic I don't know exactly what this toy is made of but when I threw away the remainder I noticed it was gooey and sticky. I'm just grateful my Bulldog is ok."
3,Fun accessories,"My son (age 7) loved this set of accessories. But beware, they are very easy to lose since they are so small."
2,Not very fresh,"I've tried both grating this ginger and steeping it in hot water for tea. Neither approach yielded a very flavorful result. While the fact that this item is fulfilled by Amazon is nice, it's unreturnable (given that it's a grocery item). I would not purchase this product again."
2,Too heavy for the suction cups,"The basket is sturdy and heavy but this ledge will not stay in the corner with only suction cup grippage. It is so heavy I was worried about it dropping and chipping my bathtub so I put towels in the bathtub and tried over several days in various ways to make it worked. Epic fail - I gave up and now use it as a garage organizer on my workbench.If the manufacturer could make the basket lighter weight, I'm sure it would work well."
1,DID NOT RECEIVE THE WATCH,"I BOUGHT FROM A SALES PARTNER FROM AMAZON, WACHTGRABBER, AND DIDN'T RECEIVE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE UPS DELIVERED TO SOMEONE ELSE THAT WAS NOT INDICATE ON THE ORDER AND I DON'T KNOW THE PERSON THAT RECEIVED, THEREFORE I DIDN'T RECEIVED THE WATCH. IN CONTACT WITH AMAZON I WAS TOLD TO SOLVE THIS MATTER WITH THE VENDOR AND THE VENDOR (WACHTGRABBER) TOLD ME THAT WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM IF THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED TO SOMEONE ELSE, THEY ASKED ME TO CONTACT UPS. UPS DIDN'T ANSWER MY E-MAIL. SO AMAZON HAVE SOME TERRIBLE PARTNERS AND THE COSTUMERS PAYS FOR THE DELIVERER PROBLEM. I PAYED AND DIDN'T RECEIVED THE WATCH!!! I'M TRYING TO RECOVERY THE MONEY SINCE AUGUST 25..."
4,Almost perfect...,"This is a great item, small enough to carry in your computer bag to allow charging of a laptop (and other items) when there is no AC outlet available. The package includes an adapter for an air power socket, should one be available. In addition to the single AC outlet, this unit provides a USB power socket so that you can charge devices via USB cable.The only con is that the unit has a fan which is very loud. It does not even appear to be thermostatically controlled - it comes on full speed as soon as the inverter is powered up and stays that way until you turn it off.Considering where it is intended to be used - in a car or an airplane - the noise is probably not a problem, but it is does seem excessive."
3,Lost Manual,"The good news: light, compact and versatile. The not so good news: noisy fan which is essential or the unit will overheat.The bad news: I lost the manual for this unit and cannot find a source for one on the internet. Nor can I find a website for the mfr. If anyone has a manual that I could copy, please contact me ""exec-vector@usa.net"". Thank you."
2,Worked at first,"This product worked perfectly at first. On our most recent road trip, however, the fan died and the unit would constantly overheat. It would stop outputting power, unless I kept it directly in front of an AC vent. I remember the fan being loud before, but now I cant even hear it."
1,Did NOT work on Enpower socket.,I bought this product for the sole porpose of using it on 14-hour flight with my two small children to watch movies. It did not work. I would really give NO star.
4,An excellent early comedy short,"I suspect, early on in the time of the talkies, this was great fun to make. A nice use of a guy in a gorilla suit!"
1,Family tree needs to be more intuitive.,"Poor design of user interface. Had a real problem establishing a beginning point with family tree. Information was inexplicably shuffled or lost, making parents children and children parents. Required a great deal of back-tracking to fill in information. Required data re-entry over and over again of duplicate information because does not sense a connection between family members. No obvious way to save a version you are working on. Needs some kind of overview mode on constantly to show what you are doing. Format is very clunkly and sectionalized. Difficult to tell what you have accomplished. Haven't tried uploading to [...] websites but it seems this software was designed for use on the website and is not really a good stand-alone. Lack of intuitive, user-friendly interface."
5,some underated music,foghat were way underated tight shoes is a well put together lp the only problem is that it dont rock like most other foghat lps now girls to chat rocks a little more but we have a different lead player eric cartwright who is not near the slide player that rod the bottle is all in all they are good cds take them on a slow ride
1,Highly toxic please read,Our dog got into this stuff and died a horrible death. Please dont use this stuff in your garden if you have pets or your neighbors do. Its highly toxic to animails as well and they only have to eat a small amount.
4,This album deserves more attention!!!,"by chance, i got hold of this album. I knew nothing about it, but when i heard it i instantly fell in love with it. the lyrics, the melodies, and his voice... all in all a really great album which deserves a lot more attention! I can hardly wait for the next album!!! and a big cheer for those who, like Rich has done with this album, doesnt take the easy way, when it comes to making music. this is the real thing, not just a machine and a pretty face! thank you Rich, and keep up the good work!!!"
4,I like an underdog,"..and one who is showing obvious potential and will no doubt develop into something great if the winds are favorable. While it does not really bear-up to comparison with Cohen, his lyrics are nevertheless very tight and nicely strung and generally superior to most of what is out there these days. The only reason this is not a five star rating is that there is an immaturity to the emotional aspect of the material. While that is not in itself bad, it turns an otherwise good song into one that tends toward maudlin at times. Maybe I'm just old."
1,Slipcover ?,Slip is the right word for this slipcover! I hate it. I bought one for the sofa and one for the love seat. I should have sent them both back right away. They are terrible.They dont do any thing more than if I tossed a blanket over the sofa. They slip all over the place.The photo is very misleading.It looks like a tight fit but it is anything but!!
2,Inexpensive but does not play DVD,"I bought several of these units for resale and sold a few without any complaints from the customers. However, I recently discovered that one of the units would not play DVD. It played CD's and MP3 discs but whenever the DVD is inserted the LCD continuously displayed ""Reading"" and then after a few minutes the player would eject the disc.I agree with the other reviewer that even though the price is very attractive, the quality of these players is suspect. I will definitely not be purchasing any of these again. Boss is a relatively reliable manufacturer and I buy and sell some of their other products so I guess this one probably slipped past Quality Control."
4,"""Moon Silk"" Siberian Iris","I received these irises in great condition. Because I received them after the blooming season, I will have to wait until next Spring for results. Hopefully, they will be spectacular!!"
3,Marge Veronica Ciconne Musical Erotica if you care,"Maddy has experienced quite a bit different scenes throughout her career - musical or graphic visual wise. So you want some dark brooding theme with moderate S&M; narcissistic pleasure, this is it.The single was an instant chaotic excitement for the fans and non fans early 90's, it captures the then fashionable beasty scenes of disco music. More than a decade had past, this single may sound a bit less layered for the contemporary remix technology.Still ""pleasurable"" if you like sensual dub remixes."
4,A real must have!,"Okay, the real reason to buy this maxi is to have the William Orbit twelve inch mix. Orbit does a completely original and rather sensuous take on the track AND includes several alternate verses rather than using the album version. And let it be said these alternate lyrics are MUCH racier than those included in the album version. The other mixes are serviceable, and will be familiar to anyone who's seen her ""Girlie Show"" tour as they are almost identical to the one she performed."
4,Good,"There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."
3,Meh.,"1. Album Edit: Just a shorter version of the album version2. Kenlou Mix: OK enough mix, much more laid back than the album version3. WO 12"": has different verse lyrics, more kinky I would say4/5. Masters At Work Mixes: sound the same except for more vocals on the club mix6/7. Jeep Mixes: sound like the Kenlou MixOverall, the lp version is amazing, the mixes are kind of bland. What we needed with this song was a fierce club mix, like the one found on the Thunderpuss Club Megamix."
3,Hits like a truck...,"If you buy this single, you're buying it for the William Orbit mix. It's excellent and features completely different lyrics than the original. It's really not to be missed and is on par with the ""Justify My Love"" remix he did two years prior to this. The other versions are all basically the same, and don't hit their stride until after the long and clumsy hip-hop beat intro that most of them feature. If you saw her Girlie Show performance on HBO or the were at a concert on the tour, the version of Erotica performed there is from this single (it sounded better in concert ironically). On the whole, nothing too great, but again the Orbit mix is fantastic and makes this single more than worth its price."
5,Madonna - Erotica,"This CD single features 7 versions of Madonna's #3 hit Erotica. They are:-1. Album Edit (4:36). This is just a shorter version of the album version.2. Kenlou B-Boy Mix (6:28). A nice version of the song. An alternative version was used on the Girlie Show: Live Down Under Tour (1993).3. WO 12"" (6:12). My favourite remix of Erotica! WO means William Orbit. A fantastic remix!4. Underground Club Mix (4:57). A good remix. I absolutely love the hissing at the beginning of this version!5. Masters At Work Dub (4:57). Not a bad remix, but not my favourite either. This may be the Maxi's weakest moment.6. Jeep Beats (5:54). I like this version. They also use words from the original version of Erotica, called You Thrill Me.7. Madonna's In My Jeep Mix (5:50). A nice closure for the Maxi.I also recommend the Erotica album (1992). This is a good Maxi. People might think 7 mixes of the same song is too much, but if you're obsessed with the song, this is your moment!"
5,from the Front Cover,"""In an age before Atlantis rose, an age rife, with sorcery and violence, the earth trembled beneath the all conquering hooves of the Kitzaak Horde, and only one man, Gath of Baal, dares to confront the Kitzaak lances, to stand between the never defeated armies and the lush valley that will, long millennia in the future, be know as the Mediterranean Sea. To save the peacful People of the Forest, Gath must dice with the gods, and the price he must pay is to become death made flesh, the Prisoner of the Horned Helmet."""
4,Lyrical depth and musical breadth,"Matt Frazier's lyrics plumb the depth of human emotion and explore the questions that we all ask -- or maybe should. I've heard him live and his songwriting just keeps getting better. My favorites: ""Can You Imagine?"", ""Why You're So Beautiful,"" and a song surely to be on the next CD, ""When You Were Wild."" Matt has a penchant for story songs about real people that truly engage. His subjects speak to us across the decades, even centuries. I'm saving 5 stars for his follow-up project because I know there will be one. This is a songwriter/musician endowed with true talent."
4,Creative Music with Meaning,Out of the Shadows features thoughtful lyrics with creative music. I haven't heard popular artists produce engaging music that makes you really want to listen and know what the author/singer is trying to get you to think about. This CD encourages thought as well as enjoyment. The tunes are catchy and I found myself singing along after just a few listens. A definite CD to own. Looking forward to the next one!
5,Good Source for Original Newman Writings,Excellent book for reading Newman in the original. These writings cover a significant part of Newman's life and give the reader a good cross section of Newman's thinking over an extended period of time.
4,A must own for hardcore Sonic fans.,"This is a digest of the first four issues of the now classic Sonic The Hedgehog comic produced by Archie comics. It first launched back in 1993 after it was apparent that Sonic was here to stay. It's perfect for the hardcore fans out there who want to collect everything Sonic related they can. The comics included are fairly good, it is well worth the asking price. This may not appeal to everyone however, alot of the newer Sonic fans will not identify with the characters in the comics. I am now an adult and grew up with these comics and I highly reccomend this book to anyone. However, a stated above I think this only appeals to a specific group, and casual Sonic fans may not like it. Thankfully it's fairly cheap, and is worth taking a chance on in my opinion."
5,More Sonic stuff!,"Let's go back... Waaaay back. To when Sonic was a wee hedgehog starting his own comic in 1993. Remember how Sally used to look? Remember when Rotor was called Boomer? Remember when Robotnik had Crabmeat and all those other baddies? Well this'll give you a serious look back into the past of the popular comic. If you want to know what happened at the beginning of the comic, because (like me) you weren't an avid fan at that time or if you just want another Sonic book, get this book. Don't expect back-breaking action, but this is still worth a couple hundred reads if you've got the time. This book is similar to Sonic Firsts, but Sonic Firsts has some things editted and cleaned up so it looks more modern. Get both and see how much Sonic has changed over the years!"
3,Very 'kiddie' Sonic.,I'm a big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog and I love the current comic books but this is a collection of the first few issues from way back in 1993 (I actually remember getting these when I was 12 years old) and it's a bit too childish. The stories are totally neutered and the animation bright and colorful. It's nowhere near as sophisticated as Sonic is today. It's worth getting if you're a completist or as a gift for a (very) young kid but don't buy it expecting anything like Sonic's current comic-book output.
4,One Funny Event Leads To Another,"Good for 3-7 yrs. A chain reaction style story similar to Mike McClintock's ""A Fly Went By."" The trouble begins when young boy Chris, takes his bike for a ride down a steep hill, and can't stop. He slams into one animal after another, bringing them along for an unwanted adventure. It's funny, it has a good sense of rhythm, and the illustrations are first-rate."
2,major let down,i bought this game and i was so disappointed. It is good but i finished it in two hours. there is no save function and you cannot save during the middle of a game. there are 6 levels and you have to collect crystals and it is impossible. it has good graphics but it is very easy to finish
5,Fantastic game!,"The best PpG video game,bar none! Exciting gameplay, and just about the best PpG graphics of any of the 5 PpG video games available. Looks almost like the tv show!As to game play, it was a little hard. Adult PpG fans should like it better than the kids for this reason. Too bad that BAM! did not devote as much attention to thier other PpG videogames than they did to this one. A MUST HAVE for the hardcore adult PpG fan."
5,one of the best powerpuff games,"this is one of my favorites to play! even if you don't like the powerpuffs this game SHOULD change your mind. :P it has beautiful graphics, actual voices from the show, group attacks, the ability to pick up logs and other things, individual special powers, and secret passage ways!!so you're not disappointed, this is a SIDE-SCROLLING GAME. the powerpuffs fly across streets, cities, and sky as you either dodge or clobber enemies with your fists or eye beams. i recommend buying this!"
1,Too Hard to Have Any Fun,"The game looks cute, but when I got it and started playing it I couldn't even get passed the first level! I don't think I'm THAT bad at playing video games, but with this one I am! The graffics and colors are cute, and so is the concept but for me it's just too hard. What you do is you have the three girls floating around and you lead them and shoot bad guys and when you shoot someone you get a little circle that you have to pick up. I think you have to get a certain number of those circles. But when your girl gets hit, her ""will to fight"" goes down and eventually-if you get hit enough-that girl disappears and you have to play with a different girl. You can switch back and forth with the girls though, which is fun. It's a cute game but too hard for me!"
3,Boring,"This game does not deserve to have a long speech in its name. The object of the entire thing was dim and simple, and I am quite sure it could get boring for some children. It would be a disappointment to anyone who was a fan of them. I am not, but the game looked action packed and puzzling, the type of game that strikes me as fun. I purchased it, and within minutes of gameplay I became bored.Use my advice wisely and try to veer away from purchasing cheap commercial games such as these."
5,Memory sticks were perfect,"I was reluctant to buy these off the Internet for fear I would get the wrong ones or worse yet, some dead ones. They arrived promptly and work perfectly for upgrading the RAM on my Compaq Presario VN 4310NR laptop. Saved about $130. Very happy."
2,Not one of his best,"I have been a fan of Chris Ledoux for more than 25 years; he's my favorite singer. However, this CD just doesn't compare to his better work. Except for a few songs, he gets away from his rodeo/Western songs. Clearly someone made him sing sappy songs like ""Love Needs a Fool"" and ""Light of the World,"" two of the worst songs he's ever recorded. These lame songs could have been sung by any pop/country singer and must have been someone's misguided idea of trying to broaden Chris' appeal."
2,The graphics are what give it the two stars,In my opinion it's just too much like it would be in an arcade. You don't even see the gun when you shoot. It's fun for about five minutes. It really stinks when youre expecting something more from the game. I give this game two stars because of the graphics. They are pretty good considering that the game SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. As a fellow video gamer I advise you not to buy ths game. It was a waste of my fifty dollars.
3,More fast-paced action,"This game is virtually identical to Silent Scope 1, albeit with a few enhancements. SS2 is longer and there are more bosses. The environments of SS2 are a little better too. But the structure of the game (including final single-bullet shot at the end) is basically the same. One nice feature of SS2 is that you can practice the bosses separately once you have reached them in 'Story' mode. This is particularly helpful for 'Sho and Kane' (they move quite fast). As with SS1, the game is fairly easy, so don't pay full price. A used copy or rental is the best bet."
2,"I like shooters, but this was dissapointing","First of all, I'm not a first-person shooter freak. However, I started playing this game for the first time at two o'clock one saturday. I fully completed the game at four thirty later that afternoon. I thought the graphics were great, the bosses a bit too easy to beat, and the missions not too complicated. I guess that's why it only took me 2 1/2 hours to beat. I think a two-player mode would add to the fun. Their version of a two-player game is getting two TV's and hooking up 2 PS2's via i-Link. I haven't played the first Silent Scope so I can't compare the two, but I don't like how you only control the sniper gun. I thought you would be able to move around, but the game does that for you. Overall, I would stay away from this game if you really want to shoot things. Instead, try Metal Gear Solid 2 or Half-Life were you have control of every move. Or at least RENT IT FIRST."
4,Great game. BIG challenge.,"This is an amazing game! I picked it up with a gift voucher I got for my birthday after playing it in the arcade. I played it there and it was my first time playing. Being the passive-aggresive person I am, I played shooting range mode and got 3rd on the high score list (featured in the home edition, I like the high score lists!) So since it was so cheap I bought it, and oh am I glad I did!It is challenging, but it grows on you in a matter of hours! I just keep getting better and better! The only part of this game that I really hate is original mission mode, believe me, except for the boss battles, stick with the arcade mode.Plus, it has a HUGE options menu to fit your every need! Konami's done it again! (I'm a big DDR freak!) All in all, a great game, and espically for the price!"
1,THIS GAME ... BIG NOODLES,silent scope 2 was the most boring pile of monkey ... I have ever seen and played. this game should die and burn in ... . I think this game deserves a 1 rating because it truly ... my noodle. Warning do not buy this horrible noodle ... game.
4,Nice canvas hangers,I have ordered all the padded hangers! The satin ones ( 3 types) and these canvas ones. These are not as elegant as the satin ones and seem more utilitarian but they are still nice quality and maybe good for men's sweaters or items that need a little texture to keep them on a hanger. I will definitely get use from them. One reviewer mentioned that they use them to hang damp laundry you do not want to put in the dryer so I will try that with these.
2,Smartster,"I bought these hangers specifically for sweaters so that they will stay on the hanger without sliding off. These hangers basically go straight across, which leaves unattractive knobs at the end of shoulder area. Unfortunately, since I've already opened the package to test this, I can't return them. I thought I might be able to bend them into a more sloped angle, but I think they're wood underneath, so was afraid they'd just snap. What a waste!"
5,Best padded hanger!,"I have ordered several sets of these hangers. They are very durable. Best of all, clothes do not slip off the hanger as with other hangers that are covered with some slippery material.I have used hangers like this for 5+ years and they have stayed as nice as day 1."
1,Battery questionable,"If this product has the same battery as the Black and Decker VEC157BD, than stay away from it.And is thus equipped with a lead acid battery. Which will die within the first year of usage. I used the VEC157BD only when we are traveling with the RV so thats only 3 to 4 times a year. The battery is already dead and finding a replacement is impossible. And btw replacing the battery is not easy at all and will take some technical experience which is not for everyone.The type of battery is of course totally wrong as that should have been a lithium battery.If you already own one that do not deplete the battery all the way stay above 45% depletion. It might last you more that a year.Anyway total waist of money and a perfect flashlight going to the landfill."
3,Could be Better,"I would expect better on the subject tho. Being a coach in Europe and seeing that the tackling is one of the most important problems with the players and the local coaches here, the books name attracted me a lot but I was pretty dissappointed after reading it.Very thin book, does not cover the subject really. The pictures are huge, and the quality of printing did not satisfy me at all. The comments are not clear, sometimes confusing.But still, it covers some useful drills and good advices. Since it is one of the very few books on this specific subject, might be enough for anyone who wants to get some basic information on the tackling fundamentals and/or how to make the tackling practices. But just the basics!"
4,This was Ben Hecht's light and friendly to Charlie and Helen MacArthur,"Charles MacArthur was a gifted, lovable rogue who wrote many screenplays and a couple of books, married ""the First Lady of the American Theater,"" raised two children with her, and saw their daughter die of poliomyelitis. Ben Hecht was his sometimes co-author and partner-in-mischief. Hecht's book is a glossed-over but loving account of his friend's life. What it sometimes lacks in meat and interpretation is made up in anecdotes -- this book is a Valentine."
4,One of my favorite books to buy for new parents and babies,"This was one of husband's favorite books as a child, and it is now one of my favorites as well. It is filled with classic poems that your child will remember forever and has very sweet illustrations."
5,partyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,This is such a delish album.fresh and solid drums pound with the original chanting vocals..one of the most original albums TO DATE for latin street flava! it truely is funk/rock/disco/soul....and a whole lotta laughing!MUST HAVE
5,Outstanding! Historical fiction at it's best!,"G.A. Henty, the 19th century master of historical fiction, demonstrates his tremendous ability to weave a great story into the details of history. His accounts of the fall of Jottapotta, Gamala, and Jerusalem are faithful to all first hand accounts of Rome's war in Israel. In places whole passages can be linked with Josephus' account of battles and seiges. This is a must read for any historical fiction fan, and a dynamic story for those who just want good reading. I strongly recommend this book. (1LT Gary Thompson)"
1,Can I get a refund?,Not very good. Wish I could get my money back. The first chapter was so wordy and meandering that I couldn't even finish it.
2,"Non functional without downloads, Not worth the hassle","Just bought it not worth the hassleIts not very functional without tonnes of MS downloads so dont buy it if you have a 56kb modem like me. I dont want to have to download a tonne of updates, I want functional out of the box.Product Activation should not be on products this cheap, its a waste of my time. I have no problem with activation on Windows and Office because theyre high value products and at least you get to try them out before activating... This though is a hassle.The digital music converion program only converts to WMA, I expect at least one alternative format such as WAV or MP3. Bad software in a pretty box."
1,Activation Catch 22,So.. I buy the the...program but the activation code doesn't work.. I call microsoft who says they can't help me they say they have had both piracy problems and wrong activation code problems.. Microsoft says return it to Amazon. Amazon says it is unreturnable because its been opened. Catch 22...
1,Ripping Vinyl Function a Rip Off,"I bought this because it is advertised as the solution to ripping vinyl into digital media. Yes, it rips it, then it gives you a nice UI to MANUALLY TYPE IN the artist, album, AND SONG TITLES. Their media player used to apply this info to a list of 1..N tracks. It seems this s/w does not go to their db and gather the info for you. It is a real half hearted attempt. Maybe I expect too much from the largest s/w company in the world."
5,Slide Show with Narration,I wanted to be able to make a slide show with narration. I wanted the narration to be arbitrary size for each picture. There may be other software out there that do what I need but this is the only one that claims to do it. I haven't used it yet but the documentation indicates that it does everything that I need. You can do the same thing with Windows Movie Maker but resulting file can be much larger with Movie Maker.
1,Looking for a jukebox program? This isn't it.,"I was looking forward to this package because of the ""Party Mode,"" which ""Transforms your PC into a full-featured party jukebox."" That is the most misleading statement I have ever seen on a Microsoft product. ""Party Mode"" is basically a media player add-on that keeps people from accessing your other files while it's running.A jukebox program (such as eJukebox from AudioSoft) lets people browse by artist, genre, album, etc.- and then add files to a dynamic playlist. That's not what this program does. If you double-click on a song, it stops the one currently playing and begins the song you clicked on.This program:-Doesn't display cover art,-Has a complicated interface,-Doesn't give complete song info,-Let users exit by simply clicking the ""x"",If you're looking for a jukebox program, this isn't it. If you're thinking of using this program as a jukebox, save your money and just click ""full screen"" on Windows Media Player."
2,hidden gotcha,"Preliminary reviews and the box for this product tell you it only works on Windows XP. But it doesn't tell you it can only be used with the latest version of Windows Media Player; there are other competing products around.For me the real stopper came when I found out that you can't even install Plus until you have version 9 of Media Player. Until now, I've been happy with version 8, and I am reluctant to update to version 9 since it won't allow you to return to version 8 if problems occur.I wanted to try the analog to digital features of Plus, but I'm afraid this will stay in the box until and unless I decide to risk the upgrade to version 9 of Windows Media Player. Sigh!"
2,not really a must...,"Although many of its stuff are pretty fun to use and creative, but after all, it is not really a ""must"" have item. and though its only 18 bucks, still seems a bit expensive for its actual usage."
1,"Thank you Microsoft, I lost a day...","So I bought this thing, based on the reviews and the price, mainly to do a slide show from our last vacation photos.I really like the product (that the slide show) BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO SAVE YOUR WORK AS YOU GO. You have 1 shot at it, once you are done and that's it. Guess what, I spent a day building a slide show with sound and music. Did generate the show a few times, being carefull to not exit at that would 'close' the project for ever. Decided to add one more slide, generated the slide show and bang, the app crashed... +/- 6 hours of work down the drain (sound a lot, but by the time you add voice and music bit on 120 photos time flies by).Think twice before byuing this thing...(by the way ther rest of the utilities are fairly useless specialy those dancers...)"
2,Big Disappointment,"Lot of Filler. I've gotten free downloads from Microsoft with more value. Who is going to hook up their PC in the living room for a party? If you don't like Moviemaker (which stinks), the extras are useless.Hmmmm. Alarm Clock?!? Who sleeps by their computer...(Okay, some of us do).Need I say more?!?!"
4,Huntworth snow camo,"I have owned for about three years both the bib pants and parka/jacket, in size XL. They are a mid-range piece of clothing, for a very good price. The fabric is a medium weight brushed nylon, with a tricot lining..there is NO insulation. There is some ""whoosh"" when moving, like all waterproof clothing, but it is very subdued compared to other items. The only better product I have found are Frog Toggs, but they don't come in snow camo.The bib pants have a very good fit, with excellent suspenders, and plenty of room to move around. They are snug enough in the waist/bib area that snow cannot get down the front when crawling, and they are pretty waterproof. There are two weak points, in my view: There are NO pockets, or even pass-throughs to reach pockets, and the ankle adjuster straps are very weak. I've solved these problems by wearing a fanny pack or vest and wearing gaiters over my boots. I would buy them again."
5,Keep on truckin!,"The song was the brainchild of Loose Records owner Andy Titcombe. The four-track EP was an entry in the lower reaches of the UK Top 100 singles chart and helped re-launch The Wurzels career in the late 1990s through into the new millennium.The songs have a distinctive Country & Western feel to them - and it is surprising that the EP didn't do better in the States - although perhaps The Wurzels and Eddie Stobart are brands rather too British to translate into North America.Although it seemed a move away from their agricultural songs for The Wurzels, British trucking firm Eddie Stobart also started out in a farming community years ago. And Eddie Stobart is probably older (as a firm and as an individual) than The Wurzels!"
1,A dishonest release.,"These are just pre-recorded Cuban songs (all of which are available elsewhere) played over stock footage of Cuba.And the stock footage repeats, and repeats, and repeats.The footage has ALL been treated with computer generated effects, like a bad 80's video.And the stock footage repeats, and repeats, and repeats.And there are no actual performances by musicians, just stock footage of musicians, with their heads cropped off camera.And the stock footage repeats, and repeats, and repeats.An unscrupulous cheese-ball POS exploiting the popularity of Cuban music, with zero (heck, I'd say well into the negatives) merit of it's own.The DVD doesn't even include one single itty bitty piece of literature, not even a sheet of advert. We are talking near zero production costs here.And the stock footage repeats, and repeats, and repeats.KP"
5,The 157th best book ever!,"This book is electric much like the slide of the same name; the one danced at weddings. This book is magic much like the johnson of the the same name. Unlike my johnson this book is not very long, but then again it doesn't ruin promnight with premature [...] problems. This book is wacky and eclectic with stories and interviews and essays on well over two subjects. This book is deserving of a infomercial epitaph like, XL, Omni, Ultra, or 2000 and 1. It is both exciting and interesting. I wonder whether I should have taken out the johnson remark, [...]. I say the johnson comment stays, james Stegall would want it that way."
4,helpful ideas,"this book is a good reminder that Islam is a peaceful religion. We are all equal, this book helps to understand why."
1,Do NOT buy this charger for E815 !!!,"The voltage and current ratings are close, but it ruined two batteries. I could go for almost a week with minimal use on a full charge until I used this charger. Now one and half days at best with NO use. Another phone which has moderate use has to be charged nightly. Save your $8 and put it toward an authentic Motorola charger."
1,NorCal Tech User,"Although the vendor fulfilled order as promised, the product was poor quality. The holster/clip broke after a week of use. Good price. You get what you pay for!"
4,Wish it had a folding plug,The price is right and I am actually using it on the charging base. I am using a different charger for travel that does have a folding plug.
3,Easy To Break,This was a nice slim charger that I used extensively. I found it very useful. The only issue I had with it was that the casing broke within about 3 months. I suspect it is because the prongs do not collapse.
5,Naruto Just Has To Be Good,"Although this series is probably overly prolonged, the writing is good and the animation isn't too rotten for a cheaply produced series. There is rarely an episode that isn't interesting in some manner and although the idea of murder is passed off as if it were somehow a natural thing, nevertheless the series is well worth buying."
3,Naruto = DBZ,"I've loved the Naruto series up until this point in Volume 6. The constant repeats of scenes from previous episodes get a bit excessive and the non-stop chatter between characters doing the same exact thing several minutes ago (aka the Third Hokage is pulling out Orochimaru's soul scene). I wished the dvds had the option of removing the annoying ""extra"" scenes and stick with the manga-style storyline. Because of this, Naruto episodes are beginning to become Dragon Ball Z episodes where we're blasted with Gohan and the others screaming at the top of their lungs for the entire episode that is absolutely pointless and annoying."
1,Tooth and Nail's Typical Rock band become even more trendy.,"This Cd is awful in just about every way. It is a perfect example of how Tooth and Nail has lost thier edge in the scene and has become a victim of the trendy scene and emo kids. The vocals are weak, the sceaming is passion-less, and the guitars sound like played though a toy microphone. they are the worst band ever. not to mention absolutely weak live."
3,A Fair Album...,"This new album by Spoken wasn't a let down to me but it wasn't what I expected. The songs on this album flow great together, so as a whole it is great. I don't think any of these could really stand alone like on their first four releases but it still delivers a punch though a light punch. I will say that for fans of Coheed and Cambria though this album will amaze them as it amazed me since I just recently discovered Coheed and Cambria. The two major highlights on this disc are ""Last Chance to Breathe"" and ""Bitter Taste"" which features Cory Putman from Norman Jean (a band that definitely rocks!), so it had better be a highlight. Other than that it is a fair album...true fans of Spoken like myself will still pick this one up."
2,Last Chance to......stay a good band,"Man.....what a let down this record was to me!! I am a huge Spoken fan, and was anxiously awaiting this new, highly buzzed about release.Needless to say, it was a day of extreme let down. They just didn't move ANYWHERE with their craft! Matt still has a great voice, and the band still has flashes of tight intensity, but everythign in between was so........common (for lack of better words).I am NEVER one to fault a band for changing sounds on albums, or trying new things, but this direction really does not work for Spoken. For heaven's sake boys...Cyndi Lauper covers??????It is like Rage Against the Machine decided to make an album and sound like Hawthorne Heights.I still love Spoken, and am in fact anxiously awaiting to see them live in a few days. But......I really do hope their subsequent releases are stronger, or they should really consider parting ways with Tooth & Nail."
4,"Great band, great message","I had the opportunity to meet Detour 180 back in 2006 or 2007 when they were touring out in Indiana. Don't ask me why it took this long to pick up their CD. My personal favorite track is ""Back To The Cross"": powerful words and a tune that sticks in your head."
5,Awesome!,We LOVE this CD and love the band- good people - all of them- with a heart for God and music ministry!
4,I love song #2,"I bought this CD after hearing, ""You Know My Name"" on the radio. I love that song and it always moves me."
3,It was okay,"This book was ok but it was sort of confusing to me. I mean Sam was in trouble in the end and she was about to go to San Francisco, CA. Other than that and being a little boring I would recommend it to you because everyone has a different opinnion. P.S. book #12 is called Rain Dance and it comes out July 27th 2004!!!"
5,hahahaha,"haha this book was funny and all around good, Jake was hilarious,""Do you know how embarrassing this is?"" he hissed, pulling her around the corner near the drinking fountain.""Hanging around the girls' bathroom?"" Sam managed. Her voice gurgled between a sob and a laugh.^that is part of the book, it is embodied in a review therefore I am not plagerizing, but it's real funny to."
3,Phantom Stallion #11,"Not the best for me, but still, a good story. Detailed, good plot. Easy to read, and has a fun message. Takes a bit of time to finish, so I enjoyed it."
2,Phantom stallion,"RecommendationI recommend this book to everyone who is 13 and up because it's more of a commitment and faith story. Another reason would be that is was a very interesting story about friendship. For example, Sam confronts Linc Solcum and tells him to stay away from her horse and that proving him self a cowboy isn't worth trying to hurt her horse. ""Stay away From Him, catching him wont prove you're a cowboy"". Another example is that Sam is so committed to protecting her horse she tells her grandmother that she will do anything t save him from Linc. ""Gram, I know that the Phantom Is Blackie. I will do anything to keep Linc away From My Foal"". In conclusion if you like horse stories then this would be a good book for you."
5,Great Book!,I used the book last weekend to check out the caves on Vancouver Island. I had never even heard of them before. Too Qool! BC Car-Free was right on in its description and details. Next week I'm going to do my first kayaking trip using the book.
4,at paradise gate,"Anna Robison and her three daughters: artistic Helen, practical Claire and the youngest, tomboyish Susanna, plus her granddaughter Claire love to reminisce about their past. Theygather in Anna's house, where their father Ike is dying. Anna, who refuses to consider a live-in nurse, must tend Ike herself. As she goes about her every day tasks of preparing food and doing housework, she recalls her often rocky marriage and motherhood. Smiley has a keen eye for detail for thesehomely tasks and the day-to-day aspects of dealing with an invalid shine through keenly."
1,Customers relations problem,"I already own this EXACT pet crate and love it! When I purchased another it did not come as the one I had. I had no help with customer service trying to replace the product or even purchase the additional parts missing or at the very least help with return shipping charges. Bottom line, make darn sure the merchandise you are viewing is exactly everything you want because once its delivered to your door, like it or not, it's yours!!"
5,Great book!,"A friend gave this book to my daughter who has three children. She liked it so much, she gave it to me to read. Although we no longer have young children, I was so impressed by the book and the practical information it provided. Its divisions are very clear, and it offers easy to follow tips and suggestions."
5,Ideas and advice for raising children,"This book by the Ramey's is actually third in a series of books about raising children, from infants through school age. The book is very clearly written and provides many good ideas for helping parents to relate well to their children as well as helping children adjust to changes in their lives, such as starting school. The authors provide research examples to verify the things that they recommend and my husband and I have found all three books to be very helpful and fun to read."
4,"Great, but a clone","This game is really fun, and includes eight Maverick levels followed by three Boss levels. Also, it includes the eight Maverick bosses from the first Xtreme Game. However, it, like it's prequel are technically remakes of the regular Mega Man X games. All the Mavericks, and most sections of their stages are ripped directly from MegaMan X - Mega Man X4. However, the story is new, and some of the bosses in the final three levels are new. Good game, just not all original."
2,BAD GAME,This game is a combanation of X1 2 and 3. its pretty fun but way to easy. with using DNA souls to buy upgrades make your charecter way to strong. boss stratgies suck and this is easyer then X5 that pretty sad. still it has the same classic music and graphics. also there a fully playable zero for all you zero lovers out there. you cant duck but thats not a down side. I thick they shoud make Xtreme 3 maybe that would be better. BUT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON AN EASY GAME LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,NOT THE BEST!,"THIS BOOK WAS ONE THAT I COULD PUT DOWN WITH NO PROBLEM. IT WAS JUST O.K. THERE WERE PARTS OF THE BOOK THAT WERE BORING, BORING, BORING."
4,gem of a film,"It's no way the best film of this year, but surely is one of the best. An earnest effort! Kapoor has written, directed & executed the film aplomb. Right from the moment we are taken to this small town, it catches your attention. Plus, The first 30 minutes are hilarious, the scene where Rishi is welcomed, the entire sequence is the most memorable sequence of the enter prise.Performance-wise: Rishi Kapoor is excellent. The veteran plays himself, though a caricature here, shown as rude-turned likable character. He's in full from, once again. Priyanshu Chatterjee is fabulous, though his romantic angle with Kulraj Randhawa is boring and minus point in the proceedings. Saurabh Shukla, Grusha Kapoor & others give first-rate performances.on the whole 'Chintuji' is a gem of a film. Face-Value wise, nothing. Script wise, Fab! Thumbs Up!"
2,Wait till tony Hawk 3!,"This game is bad. Theres good graphics and thats about it. horrid music and a very small assortment of tricks, and some tricks dont even have names. It also has a very unconsitent frame-rate (always slowing down) THPS3 is almost here, and that will blow this game out of the water."
2,about as deep as a puddle,"This game does lots of thing so-so and nothing great. There aren't many tricks, the levels don't have many good lines, the music is stinky... Beware: rent before buying."
2,"Bobby Burnquist, what have you done?","This game is awful! If anyone is thinking ""Tony Hawk"" when they look at this game, think it not!!! There is no concept of motion whatsoever. Even if you are able to cancel out that annoyng announcer, you still get to put up with awful gaming and second hand punk rock. This is surely a ten minute game designed to rake in a few bucks before Hawk 3. Save your money my friends. Tony Hawk three is just around the corner. If you're not game skating with Neversoft, then apparently it isn't ""skating game software""."
3,X-Games,"It's a good game that doesnt really get boring quick.The graphies are good. And the gameplay is ok, the tricks are a little hard to do, and learn.In the end its a pretty good game."
3,i love skateboard and it work so good thanks,i am 35 yrs and i am deaf and i love to play skateboad different games like that more etc and thanks man to send it to me and i want more different game but right now my credit card is due over payment so wait i will pay more to pay them okay
4,An Exceptional Amplifier,"The Crown Xs700 amplifier did an excellent job powering my two JBL W15GTi subwoofers. The setup is very simple, and the amplifier wasn't too heavy. The one bone I have to pick with the Xs700 is the cooling system. The twin fans inside it are always on low or high, never off. Also, since they draw air from the front panel of it, they are right there in the front, making them extremely audible. If purchasing the Crown Xs700, make sure you have a rack of some sort which can cover the front (with some distance between the cover and the amplifier for ventilation), or hide it somewhere. Other than the noise, It's power is more than plenty. I'm giving it 4/5 stars."
1,REMOVE THE COVER ART !! IT'S MISLEADING!,This item is very MISLEADING. I have bought from sellers of this items several times and every time the CD comes its a differnt CD. I have yet to receive the CD with the cover art shown. PURPLE TEXT with LISA standing (IS what I Want). The one I keep getting is with GREEN TEXT with LISA crouched down. Someone NEEDS to change the cover art for this item. VERY MISLEADING
5,The greatest group to shortly live,"Allow me to give a high five to all you dedicated Blind Melon fans out there, or should I say to all the kidz who know what talent sounds like, I'd just like to pick at that Mook from Conneticut. Yo, there is no such song as San Andreas Fault, of course we all know that it's St. Andrews Hall, or Fall depending on the album. Lemonade, a song about a heroin addiction is more cheerful than a song about the responsibilities of fatherhood? Where you not impressed with Jenny Krouse's chilling voice in Mouthfull of Cavities? I'd suggest you listen to tracks 2-13 a couple more times before jumping off your mouth. All the kidz here in Arnold, CA will miss you Shannon!"
5,This is the kind of music that puts a smile on your face !!,"Unfortunetly Shannon Hoon died 21 october 1996, they did excellent music. I think the vocals were the main part of this music he had this amazing, non human voice!!! He always wrote ""HAPPY"" kind of music, you wouldn't have thought that he could have died of an overdose. I really respect the band but I don't think they will ever be the same because they lost an important element in the sound of their music. If you like enthusiastic lyrics you should ear them out!!!!"
4,Wishing for more meals,"As assured a sophomore as anything we have seen in the same era, Soup is still an understated masterwork of blue-collar alternative from a long-missed group."
5,One of the best albums of all time,"Blind melon does not dissapoint. Thats the bottom line. Any Blind Melon you hear is going to be skillfully crafted musical mastery, but this is the cream of the melon crop. The album starts real strong with galaxy, but there is virtually no drop off at all through the entirety of the album. It is mixed extermely well, and the songs flow together pretty seamlessly. Standout tracks include galaxy, vernie, walk, carseat, and st. andrew's fall, but thats just my opinion and my mood right now. Tomorrow it could be a totally different list. Thats how deep and flawless this album is. Every song is a classic. Lead singer Shannon Hoon was one of the greatest singer songwriters of this generation and he will never be underappreciated by me or anyone I have infected with Melonitis. Get this album."
3,Not Solo Guitar....,"Although the artists here are exceptional, the title is very misleading. Most of this is group or trio compilations. You even get a voice track on disk 2, number 11, Angel Eyes!!!!!!!!! Don't despair though...I found two nice solo pieces...number 3 and 10 on disk one."
5,It helped to open my eyes to the world around me!,It is a perfect little book to carry with you for inspiration. It makes me want to take a walk... and the beautiful thing about this book is that it allows me to take a walk in my mind without ever leaving my office or room. I have and will continue to read it over and over.
3,Some gems,"Not the best book I have ever read but there are some real gems of wisdom here. Thoreau is as usual a man of nature and the natural world. His ideas on the joys and benefits of a stroll through the wilderness are as relevant today as they were back in his day. If our generation followed his advice, there would be fewer people suffering from obesity and degenerative health problems."
3,You get what you pay for,"Thoreau was a creature of his time, and this book reflects that. It is a good window onto Thoreau's worldview, but that worldview is certainly not above criticism. Ethnocentrism and manifest destiny and the pristine myth are woven all through.The free Kindle version, like other public domain Kindle books, is missing large chunks of the text. I assume these may be block quotes or poetry or some other specially-formatted text. That this is a common failing of free Kindle books does not make it a less irritating one."
5,Walking,Required reading for freshmen entering SUNY Geneseo in preparation for an Adirondack Adventure. Bought this version after inadvertantly getting an abridged Walking.
5,Great essay but...,This is one of Thoreau's best essays. But you can find it free in about fifty places on the internet.
5,A true classic on your kindle,"I've always loved Walden and Thoreau's other books. The Kindle makes it easy to take it with you. When you are out walking you can have Thoreau's classic words with you.The book is great, no noticed typos in the book."
3,Why we go west?,In this short essay. Thoreau explains in his own terms why men travels west. A fascination with sunsets is partly to blame for man's desire to search for that place in the horizon.
1,great book - bad publisher,"this is a great book, by a great author, but ruined by a bad publisher. the paper and binding are substandard, and the covers marred by ads for the publisher.there are lots of other publishers with this book on amazon - try one of those."
3,Starts strong,"But leaves me flat towards the later part of the book. Seemed to wander a bit, not staying on subject"
2,Walk on,"Cannot beat thoreau's essay, walking. Love to share with those special people who walk through my life that I feel will cherish this piece, also. Was mighty displeased with quality of this book as I was going to gift it. Oversized and flimsy pages not aesthetically pleasing. I know it's what's on the inside that matters, but I was hoping for a much more attractive gift."
2,'Walking' by Henry David Thoreau,"'Walking' is an inspirational booklet best suited for the avid rambling Thoreau fan.However, considering Thoreau's economical environmental concerns I would have thought it more appropriate to have printed this mammoth booklet in one third its size making it portable reading material.The next time I order a book I'll study the size/dimensions first. Had I known this I would not have bought this edition."
1,Far from complete...,This set does NOT contain the pilot movie FLASH GORDON - THE GREATEST ADVENTURE OF ALL that in fact kick-starts the story. By buying this set you enter the adventure AFTER the main arc and exposition that happens in the Pilot. This is absolutely incomprehensible. The Pilot isn't even available in DVD in ANY form. Why didn't Filmation licence the pilot along with the series?.In the extras there are PLENTY references to the Pilot film but NOWHERE in this edition the publishers bother to explain the absence of the Pilot in the set.Picture quality is fuzzy and a bit pixilized due to compression.
4,Great cartoon memories,"Flash Gordon are one of my favorite cartoons from all time, the SciFi who handles in each chapter are great but what It likes me more is that Flash Gordon was a kind of adult type animation with nice SFX, until for the time when the producers or don't know who exactly decided to change its estructure and make it a childish cartoon... bad move but a must have, only for the season one."
4,"Better than the live-action movie, but...","There's not much I can add that hasn't been posted already. But there is something that the other reviewers seemed to have overlooked - the quality of the digital transfer. They never bothered to clean it up, not the sound, not the picture. I'm sure that this is a true copy of the original, but the original had quite a few specks and lines popping up on top of the image. Case in point, you're watching the opening credits and a vertical line appears and runs across the image. This happens within the episodes themselves, too. Watching this is like watching a very good VHS movie. So buyer beware, if you loved the show, then get it for the nostalgia. But only the true devoted follower may be willing to put up with the poor treatment. I hope someday they'll release the feature movie and a cleaned-up, digitally enhanced, version. However, by then, we all may buy our movies on slivers of crystal memory modules, or something."
3,Bring back my childhood memory,"This Flash Gordon DVD set is nice for personal collection. This brings my childhood memory when I watched this years ago. True, that the technicolor and pictures are still poor. Some of scenes have been being used several times and if you watch it carefully, you could identify which scenes they have been using, but hey, what do you expect? perhaps that's how they made cartoon on '70.However, there are things that I regret:1. No Subtitle in english2. No enhancement sounds (still 2 channels)3. No enhancement picturesAnyway, in overall, this DVD collection is worthy to buy for those who love Flash Gordon cartoon"
5,excellent hard hat,this detroit tiger hard hat was perfect and would recommend to anyone who is in need of a hard hat and is a tiger fan!!
4,"Nice design, photo looks good - quality not great though","The globe looks good and when you put photos in they look very good. So this is probably the most important part - it works very well for what it is. But the globe is made of thick plastic and when you squeeze it, you can dent it with your fingers, using plastic is probably safer than glass, but it gives it a bit of a cheap feeling. Also there was a fairly large air bubble in the one that I received - which is ok, but it would be nice to have no air in it at all Overall I'm pleased, but not thrilled."
4,Very nice globe - once you figure out how to open it,"Good size globe, not easily breakable, BUT -- the manufacturer should have included instructions on how to open it, in order to insert a photo. I was twisting and twisting the base (the intuitive thing) and I was getting nowhere, until I realized I had to shimmy the base and pull it straight out. Then it opened up. Apart from that, it's very nice."
4,TEARS TO HER EYES,"I bought two of these.In one I inserted a photo of a woman's deceased daughter and gave it to her for Mother's Day, this morning. Brought big tears to her eyes.The globe is not perfect, but for the price, it hit a home run. Several people who have seen hers now want one for their own use."
5,Snow Globe,Vendor was prompt in shipment. 1 globe arrived with a slight leak but was promptly and cheerfully replaced.
3,Innovative use of archival data for soil degradation trends,"The title of the book is an allusion to the widely known and influential Losing Ground by Eckholm (1976), one of the early doom-sayers, who like several writers after him warned of the dangers of soil erosion and the impending calamity in food security. Lindert came, with respect to China and Indonesia, to a different conclusion which is partly unconvincing. He deals with arable soils only, representing a small percentage of the total area. His methodology of using archival soil analyses is innovative, but using data for total P and total K and an uncommon statistical analysis, makes the findings very doubtful and unconvincing. The overall picture is more complicated, with patchy improvements as concluded here, but also with well documented severe local erosion and desertification examples, disregarded in this treatment. Recommended for a serious evaluation and as a challenge for obtaining better data for such trend analyses."
2,Shifting Ground uses doubtful methodology,"I wrote a rather critical review, but it disappeared from the screen. Please recover it."
3,OK,"I was hoping for a little better quality item but for one night, I guess this outfit was ok. The only thing is, it's a medium and it was still pretty tight on my dachshund. Oh well."
2,Disappointing,"My 6 year old daughter is a huge Princess fan and an avid artist. We thought this was the perfect toy for her. It comes assembled and is easy to operate. There is a storage drawer for the markers and discs. She can't seem to fit everything in there easily. The top turns to focus the picture but it doesn't work very well. The lines are thick and make tracing the picture difficult even at it's clearest. (A bit of advice -- don't try to focus the picture after you've started drawing. The picture shifts and makes it difficult to realign.) Our daughter is happy because she has the toy, but she's saddened at the outcome. I do not recommend this toy."
4,Not as bad as all the reviews,My 3 yr old got this for christmas and then I read the reviews and was quite surprised...She seemed to enjoy it and our was also not blurry at all. Although they do say to use it in a dimmly lite room for better quality. Anyway I also helped her trace the different things and it was not difficult at all. Not the best but like someone else said it is just a toy to help them learn to draw and begin learning their creative side.
2,Broken,I also thought the projection was blurry. Too blurry to even draw anything. After just a few months the light went out so I changed it. It comes with an extra one. It worked for a little longer and doesn't work at all now. I also changed the batteries. Still doesn't work anymore. I don't recommend it.
2,Blurry,I bought this for my daughter and I was so excited to give it to her. It didn't work right out of the box. My husband took it part and found a pinched wire and fixed it. It you rotate the arm to much the wire gets pinched. Then when she tried to draw it was so blurry she could not draw the faces of the princesses only the hair really. We were very dissapointed.
1,Very disappointed,"My 5 year old daughter received this as a Xmas gift. We were very excited to use it but that feeling was soon deflated. The focus is horrible; it does not provide a clear picture, very blurry no matter how much you try to focus the projector. I do not recommend this product at all. If they fixed the focus issue; it would be a stellar product!"
1,Blurry junk,"Wow... what a waste of money. The ""focusing lens"" is a complete joke. At best, we can get a hazy image with big, fat lines that make tracing the image difficult at best for my 6 year old and almost impossible for my 4-year old (who the gift was actually for!). The kids kind of have fun putting the discs in and trying to guess what the image is (it's that blurry at best!), so they aren't hugely disappointed, but I certainly am."
1,Broke immediately,"My daughter had this for about half an hour before it stopped working. Replaced the batteries and the bulb, still didn't work. The battery compartment is located in the bottom of the the thing, and the wires are strung THROUGH the moveable arm (and the hinge) to the lightbulb at the top. Could not repair, took it back to the store.Great idea, but really poorly executed."
2,Would be great if it would only stay on!,"My 6-year-old daughter asked for this for Christmas becuase she thinks she's not good at drawing. It was a nice big box to have under our tree and it was the first thing she opened and begged to play with. My husband set it up and we immediately discovered a major problem. The on/off switch is a button on top of the lamp. Supposedly, you push the button in to turn it on, and push it again to turn it off. When we push ours in, the light comes on, but it pops right back up and turns it off. We solved the problem temporarily with several pieces of duct tape, but when the lamp got hot after a few minutes, the tape loosened and the lamp turned off. It was frustrating for us and for our daughter. We're planning on returning it and won't be buying a new one."
1,Terrible quality!,"The product quality is terrible - please don't waste your money. The light is too dim and the focus does not work! The idea is great, but the execution is not good. Disney - please make a similar product with higher quality!"
3,"A ""Lottery"" Without a Payoff","It's like Roald Dahl without the ironic endings. Or any endings, for that matter. The stories just stop and leave you with a quizzical, slightly annoyed grimace. However, they are well-written, finely observed character studies -- snapshots of quiet desperation detailing the sometimes funny, often contemptible minutiae of human behavior. (If Jackson were around today, she'd probably be the star writer on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."")There are a few satisfying tales -- the title piece (though a little more predictable post-""Twilight Zone"" than it must have been when originally published), ""After You, My Dear Alphonse,"" ""Charles"" and ""Colloquy"" -- not coincidentally, the only narratives with some sort of punchline. Meanwhile, there are others I might refer to when trying to illustrate a certain archetype, but that doesn't translate to literary fulfillment."
3,A few gems in here......,I loved the title story and a couple of other ones. But some of the stories seemed pointless and I would get to the end and be....huh? Like it just ended mid-writing. Some were boring. But there are some great ones in between the bad.
5,Not quite as freaky,"Its not quite as freaky as i like, but excellent in the effect of anticipation.not something for little siblings to read or hear."
1,Nothing Interesting.,"No short story I have ever read has left me hanging or wanting as much as Shirley Jackson's. This happened with more than just one story in the book. As brief as most of the stories are in this collection, I can understand there is not much room for character development. But that is why I don't care what happens to the characters. I don't get time to know them. If I don't know them, then I don't care and that is what makes Ms. Jackson's stories, in this collection anyway, difficult to read."
1,Excellent writing skills but a poor story,The writing skills are excellent but the story in itself was quite boring.Why do they carry on a tradition that's so cruel?I don't understand the point of writing such a dull book.It wasn't eerie or scary in any way.it doesn't fall under horror or comedy or factual.There isn't enough background on the characters or the hitory of the tradition and leaves me with too many questions.Why was the tradition started?Why is it kept going?Shirley jackson's writing is excellent but should be used in a different way. I preffered The Haunting.
2,Suitable for middle school child,"Ordered by error. I was surprised to find it was a classroom short story and not meant for adults. It is an old plot but with proper teaching, would help a child understand how different cultural customs could be viewed by outsiders."
4,Don't Expect to Make Sense from This,"The stories are chilling and rememberable. However, many of the stories seemed to have no point. ""Art for art's sake alone"" perhaps, but I felt somewhat empty after reading some stories and not quite understanding them. However, I am rather young, so perhaps that is just my opinion for someone in teens or twenties."
3,A little disappointing,"I read several reviews on The Lottery and Other Stories, and I decided to purchase the book. However, I must say that I was disappointed after reading several of the stories. While some of them are rather interesting, many of them left me lost and confused. There were dramatic buildups that would cause me to anticipate the ending, but the stories would end there--without any sort of resolution.I had read The Lottery in high school and though it was quite fascinating, but many of the remaining stories in the collection do not live up to the expectations that were generated by reading the title piece."
5,Twisted!!!,"I read the short story of the Lottery when I was a Freshman. I re-read it about three days ago, and it still gives me the creeps. What a briliant story. I was totally caught by surprise by the ending. For those of you who think it was demented. You just don't understand what she's getting at. She talking about society and the rituals we all perform no matter how stupid or rediculous they seem, we still do them. Masterfully written. I enjoyed it to the very end!!!"
3,"The story is classic, the price is sure to go out of style","I bought this book after watching an episode of SourceFed. They compared it to many other great books that I enjoy, so I felt that I must read this one too.The story itself is really great. It is a thought-provoking classic.This book in particular is meant to be used by middle or high school students. It seemed to me to be very good at guiding its reader, if that was what you were looking for.However, at almost 4 dollars, the 20 pages of story are not worth it. I would try to get a collection of Jackson's work from the library or buy a collection of her works Amazon for around 10 dollars. You'll get a lot more story for your buck!"
4,Amazing and disturbing.,"The stories are excellent but they leave you with a feeling of disgust, almost. What was that about? It's a good book, but not an enjoyable one."
4,Society's condemmned.,"""Fine"" short story. Reveals cruelty in society. No matter how much progress society presume, savage nature is with us all the time."
3,Be prepared- this one is different than most modern day stuff!,Interesting and different to say the least; I had to put myself in that era and think carefully after each story to get a sense of where the author was coming from................
1,This book is horrible.,This book offers no literary value to this world what so ever. The contents of the book are horrifing and I can not believe someone could actually find it within them to write this trash.
3,Generally good writing on perception vs. reality,"Sometimes quirky, often penetrating, these stories are generally engaging. She sees behind the external facade, looking into minds of people ranging from the depressed to the neurotic. The story 'Elizabeth' is particularly well done, covering a woman's desires to live a different life vs. the inertia of her racist family and their idyllic east coast town. Of course The Lottery is the capper -- a cruelly effective study of personality in a dystopian setting.Not all of it is five-star (Pillar of Salt is overwrought, for instance) but overall this collection is well worth the effort."
4,Always a pleaser....,"Shirley Jackson is currently one of my favorite authors. (And, incidentily always has been, since elementary school.) She is the author that everyone has some sort of familiarity with, unbeknownst to them. From The Lottery, to The Haunting of Hill House, to We Have Always Lived In the Castle, there is a sort of haunting timelessness in her work. No matter where you grew up, what your background, you will always find a common thread to link you to her world. And in her world, you will find, (if you pay attention) a parable to our times, a guessing game of ""could it really?.."" and, ""did it ever?""... After all of these questions, you will find yourself answering, yes, yes it did..."
5,Wow.,"In a 6th grade hour near the end of a school year in 1974, my classmates were following and in turn reading aloud something in which I was thoroughly uninterested. Bored and unattentive, I began flipping through my copy of the district's standard Reading text and came upon a story in the middle of the book that was not on the list. The title sounded innocuous, and its author had a plain-Jane sounding name. That was my introduction to The Lottery, and at the end of the hour I'm certain I had a more satisfying and rewarding reading experience than did the others."
5,Incredible,"I am not much into books, but when I read this one, it was like an awaking for me it is GREAT! because it is alot like life, you do not know who will be chosen next to do the task. As Forest Gump says "" Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know whatcha gonna next"". Kudos Shirley!"
5,Dick & Jane for New Testament Students,"This is a PRIMER. It was my introduction to the Greek of the New Testament. Dr. Hale was my first teacher of Greek, and the book was presented to our class in ""ditto"" duplication form. Ruth Lewis I believe typed the manuscript.I have used this book to introduce college students to the language. It is simple and direct, and much more practical in my view than the rote system that is more often used.""Peter sees Mark. Mark sees Peter."" And soon you are learning the grammar and gaining vocabulary. I view it as unfortunate that this book is out of print. This is probably because the traditional approach is so entrenched."
3,Leftovers,"I've been a fan of Kerouac's since I first read ""On The Road"" in junior high school. I'll read anything that he has written at least once. This play is good, but it is not his best. Alot of Kerouac's notebooks of unpublished material are coming into publication now, ""Orpheus Emerged"", ""Atop An Underwood"", etc., unforunately they are not all going to be as great as we would like. This isn't a bad play it's just not as groundbreaking as it would have been had they released it when it was written. This minor flaw is of no fault of Jack.I only recommend this book to his fans like myself who plan on reading all his work. Hopefully ""The Sea Is My Brother"" will be coming out soon.I can't think of to many more hidden treasures Jack could possibly have left."
4,Great price and good product,This is a very good buy. If you were to buy this at a retailer you would be paying much more.
4,"Great color, not as bright as expected","I am fairly satisfied with these lights. You should know the following if you're considering buying them:They're a soft blueish white that isn't distracting. It also isn't super bright. I hoped to replace my fluorescent in my 10'x8' bedroom with one strand of these to read by. They are barely adequate for reading, I will probably supplement them with a strand of regular christmas lights.There isn't a lead at the plug end; the plug is 4"" away from the first light. You might want to consider a lightweight extension cord.For what it's worth this strand was long enough to nearly cover two walls of my room, about 17'. Two strands of these wound together would probably look pretty good.Don't try to pull the bulbs out of the sockets, they appear to be non-removable."
5,This may sound dorky...but oh well.,"Okay, before you read this realize something. I'm not a dork. (maybe a little) but I'm not like, a nerd.This game is GREAT! I have a DS, Gameboy SP and gameboy color. I have alot of games. This is my favorite. It's SO addicting! I LOVE IT!I ended up trading it with my friend for some stupid game. Stupid me.So if I (a 13 year old) liked it, then GET IT! Even if you are 22."
2,A little slow?,Bought this 512MB to supplement existing 1GB PC133 memory on a Soyo K7VTA Pro motherboard. I had to throttle all the memory back to PC100 (even when this 512MB was the only module installed) in order to prevent system freezes.
1,Didn't work out,"Great price, great delivery, great service from Amazon. Unfortunately, this module didn't work in my Dell GX 110 Optiplex computer. Sent it back for a refund."
1,I got the wrong brand in the right box!,I ordered PNY Optima 512 SDR 100/133 MHz and I really got that but it was only the box! Inside the box I got another no-brand (Generic) ram. It was obvious that somebody has ordered this PNY and put his old ram in it's box then returned it.Amazon's fault was that they've never checked the returned box. I'm not returning the ram chip because I'm already outside the country and the generic ram just worked!I ended up paying more than $42 for a 512mb PC133 generic ram.
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM,"I ordered 2 of these PC100 SDRAM cards and was sent 2 256 USB flash drives, which is not at all what I ordered. After several days of trying to contact I finally go through and they said they don't carry the SDRAM anymore. I don't know why they took my money and sent me somehting completely different, but they did. I also don't know why they still have this posting up, because according to the store they don't have any more in stock and won't be getting any more in."
5,My computer is running smoothly,This was just the boost my computer needed! Easy to install. No problems at all!
5,Works great,"i had originally ordered a different ram stick but it took too long to arrive so i cancelled it and got this instead, and i must say it works perfect and really improved the overall speed of my 2001 sony vaio which am trying to extend the life, the difference was night and day. i would have safari, opera, windows, and google chrome and other programs running and this ram handle it pretty good."
1,Awful,"Extremely confusing, the story flies all over the place with no obvious connection, and there are way to many characters to completely understand the book, even though I have an incredible, almost photographic memory, I could not keep all the characters straight!"
3,NOT ENOUGH STAR STUFF,"As a Sagan fan I was hoping for more. The lectures are out of date, of course, and the statisics are totally off the wall now with new info for 15 years but I knew and expect that going in. What disappointed me was that this very small collection has so much repetative material. The man gave lectures for 30 years on TV, talk shows, radio, books and in hundreds of classes and all that they could find was a few repeat lectures?It still gets 3 stars because if you haven't heard Sagan, and you have any interest in if ""we are alone,"" then this is still a worth while buy. If you'd like to him at his best try ""The Demon Haunted World."""
4,Secrets and Lies,"Deceit has nver ben so good! In this contribution to the Royally wed series, Ms. James has done a very good job. Roland(the hero) is a man we all wish we could have in our lives. The story keeps you interested and anxiously awaiting for the next story. I highly recommend this book. Enjoy"
4,The globalization of the depression,"I actually enjoyed this book for it's very sophisticated view of the foreign exchange and global impact of the world's economy in pushing the US into a depression. There are many theories on the causes of the Great Depression, but this author's view of the British and American impact is quite interesting. Also, the author did a good job of debunking the myth that the stock market crash caused the depression. In summary, a very good book with a much more ""finacial based"" reason for the depression VS. just politics."
2,Dense and inaccessible to the non-economist,"This is not a book for the general reader. Without some background in economics, this books seems largely inaccessible. It's a dense, technical read that does not seem to flow well, much less construct a readable narrative of the great depression. For an economist, this book may be the best thing since sliced bread; I wouldn't know. For the general reader, however, this is not a useful book.Not recommended."
3,"Superb material, lousy recording.","The subject matter covered by Thich Nhat Hanh is condensed down from his many superb books, lectures, and audiotapes in this one hour ""interview"" with Michael Toms. Unfortunately, a great deal of this tape was recorded several years ago -- outdoors, under less than ideal conditions. Hanh's quiet voice is often lost in background noise, which is a shame since his message is so enlightening (no pun intended). Try any of Thich Nhat Hanh's PRESENT MOMENT audio series, TOUCHING PEACE, or MINDFULLNESS MEDITATION instead and you will be much happier."
5,You should already own this!!!,"And if you don't, HM! Seriously, Terry Lee Brown is one of the best House Music producers god-given to this planet. The tracks are clean and balanced with both Yin and Yang, not too steril but chock full of pounding beats and underlying rhythms. The vocal samplings are just that, sampled, not diva driven. I think that his music is what every DJ and music fanatic should have in their crate, even the girls!!"
2,Watch that cash money---don't waste it on this,"I got this game very quickly when it first came out, then got rid of it even quicker once I realized just how bad it really was. There is no tutorial to guide you through the basics--what is the deal? The graphics are funky, just plain funky. Long story short, go buy Advance Wars, that game R-O-C-K-S"
3,Mediocre attempt at a sim.,"After playing games like ""Theme Park,"" I can't help but feel this game isn't very deep. There's no new buildings you can build over time, no employees to hire, all you have are dinosaurs that you can find by sending out an exploration team.This may seem to give the game depth, but its not the dinosaurs that people come to see, its because of your advertisements. You can have one dinosaur for the whole game and it really wouldn't make a difference; as long as you keep advertising and buy new buses to maintain the visitor growth, you don't have to really do anything.Right now, I've been watching more than planning and actually doing anything. Konami could have easily made a deeper, more complex sim than this. Sim City was done on the SNES, why not here?"
5,JP3 Park Builder,"This is the best game ever!You get to control your own Dino park. My only complaint would be when those things pop up out of the screen that that have those expressions like your dino is sick,your dino is about to die cause those lose you money. Overall though its a great game."
4,Awsome Cheats,Some people have fun playing the hard way Ilike the Easy way for other people like me heres some cheats:Start With Maximum Money Name your park Bonus-Park you will have 1000000000 dollars!I dont see much point in this one but ill tell you anywaysStart with no DNA park name it Zero-Parkstart with 20 buses name it Luckybus-20start with all Shop Items name it Items-Park100% confidence name it-confidence100Men will love your park name it-Mens-ParkEveryone will love your park name it love-parkNo trees-Isla sornaMore plants-Isla nublarHeres a great Hint after you Deploy your Excavation Crew go back and you will be able to move the excavation guy it should help you get more DNA(...)
4,confuseing,Well I am here to complain and to say that this is a really cool game! I started off just fine in the game but all of a sudden no vistors were at my park??? Well to my surprise they were all watching s dino fight. When two dinosaurs get sick of each other they will end up fighting. The supid screen will come up with the spinosaurs sttcking a triceratops and the buses will all stop at the cage that the two dino's are fighting ahhhh the manual never said any thing about that!!! but even worse the fights are usally with my most expencive dino's. And my strongest. My carn3 group is all in the same cage and then is said that the tarbosaurs and the spinosuars were fighting!!! All i have to say about this game is it is confusing and kind of hard to learn how to play! I am still learning(...)
1,A real sleeper,Boring Need I say more...... A new low For the GBA. If you want a game like this get advance wars.
2,WOW this game [is bad],"its boring,stupid and has horrible grafics.it gives jurassic park a bad name.I only gave it 2 stars because I like dinosaurs.grafics 2/5fun 1/5sound 0/5gameplay 2/5dinofacts 3/5"
4,Very good. But not as great as it should be,"Like my title says, I really think this game is very good. I've actually been playing it pretty straight since the weekend. It IS a combo of SimPark and the others, but with the 'cool' factor of finding, grafting and hatching dino eggs, then placing them in pens for your visitors to see. Very cool idea for GBA.Downside? The manual is garbage. Konami has never really been known for great manuals, but come on guys. For a sim, you could have at least thrown in a little more info.Overall, I'd say if you like sims like this, or even if your interested in the idea, the game is worth it. The replay value alone is worth it. Especially if you have friends that have the game. Swapping DNA is a pretty cool idea."
2,Where is Mudimbe heading to?,"If you don't mind fuzzy organization, dig out ideas and criticism from ""The Idea of Africa"".If you value clarity of writing and unambiguous statements that one can discuss and possibly disprove, drop it.There is a scholarly review by Kenneth C. Wylie at [...] which I recommend before you embark into reading this book."
4,excellent and a half,"Alex Chilton may have taken Beatle pop and gave punks permission to be melodic with Big Star, but when this young Box Top was still crying like a Memphis Soul baby, Roy Wood was crafting power pop with the Move.When the Move was no more, Wood just kept power popping. On Mustard, he takes a page from Paul McCartney; he plays everything on this album. Pop, ballads, raw jams with melodic charge, Mustard is a triumph of primal musicality. These tracks are stripped compared to the masterful elegance of Wood'sBoulders.But a great artist, Wood cuts it using a sketch pencil as well as a full palate of paint."
5,"Reunited with a brilliant, but eccentric old friend","I had not listened to this album in years. Hearing it on CD brought back a lot of great memories and it is indeed a big improvement sonically over my vinyl LP. Over the years I had made myself believe that it had been something of a disappointment since I absolutely loved BOULDERS.Yes, the drum solo on ""Get on Down Home"" is self-indulgent and too long, but this is a great CD! It was like being reunited with a lost friend! It makes me sad that we had been apart for so long!The bonus tracks are really nice and ""Oh What a Shame"" fits in wonderfully. I have now revisited ON THE ROAD AGAIN and discovered MAIN STREET (why did they not release it when it was originally ready?!). Man, Roy had a great streak going there and they sound even better on CD!!!"
4,solid effort,"this is not wood's best solo effort: boulders is considerably better. but it is a fine album for the most part. the song is a really beautiful number- wood was very good at classically influenced epics like this and wear a fast gun from the wizzard brew album that were actually quite moving. why does such a pretty girl sing those sad songs and look through the eyes of a fool display wood's fascination with the sounds of the beach boys and phil spector's wall of sound. as always wood's impressive and comprehensive arsenal of instruments are used to great effect, and the songwriting and singing are generally quite good. unfortunately, for me, this is kind of his last gasp- the material i've heard that appeared after this album's release in 1975 tended to be of below average quality. mustard however remains a worthy album."
2,Not His Best Work,"Roy Wood is a great songwriter and multi - instrumentalist, who's best work was with The Move between '67-'71.His ""Boulders "" album also did his talent justice. This album is a mess with boring songs and some of the worst record production in history. Really for die hard Woody fans to have in their collection only, and even then a two rating is stretching it a little."
4,Packaging is as represented & beautiful!,"I purchased this as a gift so I cannot vouch for the quality of the clothing inside since I didn't take it apart but I can say that it arrived looking just like the picture on the website. So far, I'm pleased."
1,Tony Bennett,I thought that Tony Bennett's new CD was dismal and not up to his usual standards. I do not plan to listen to it again.
4,Bismarch,"I was interested in finding out the history surrounding Germany's Super Battleship - The Bismarch. This quest lead me to the 1960s movie and several other books. This book, by far, had the most detail about the plight and short life of this iron monster.It was a good and informative read with a healthy amount of historic photos (all B&W of course). I enjoyed it and would recommend it to you."
2,Bland,"Personally I think this is the weakest album MEGADETH has released, except for maybe RISK, but I haven't given that a proper listen yet. This album is just completely uninspired, the songs are bland, they all sound pretty much the same and the production is just wrong(especially the drums). I'm afraid I just can't get into it at all. It's not that I think it's a sell out or anything like that, I just don't think it's very good. If you want to hear MEGADETH at the top of their game, pick up RUST IN PEACE and if you want the newer style MEGADETH pick up CRYPTIC WRITINGS which is surprisingly good."
1,Megasucks!!,This CD was Megadeth's attempt at superstardom and it is a pretty weak and lame attempt. The songs are almost pop-rock sounding. There are so many repeated choruses throughout and there aren't really any heavy songs on here in what used to be the traditional Megadeth style. It is and probably will always be my least favorite Megadeth CD. Only buy this one if you are a diehard fan.
4,Megadeth at their best,"Certainly Megadeth's best album. I really like 90% of it. ""Addicted To Chaos"" is the best cut off this album. The album has an overall relaxed and somewhat dark mood, considering it's a hard rock album. Good drumming. Better than Cryptic Writings, just by a little."
3,MEGAhooks,"Man, what a range of reviews on this album! I can understand it, too. This ain't 1986 Megadeth... and yes, they did sell out here. But you know what, I've never heard a band rock out around 40 the way they did when they were 25. Epecially acts that were once thrash. This album focuses on melody and hooks, and sure, it's sometimes hard-hitting (albeit not with the same former intensity). But it may just be a case of mind coast or an attempt to please an older fan base, I'm not sure. I can't wait to read the reviews for ""Risk,"" they'll probably be bloody awful!"
1,poop,Megadeth was at one time one of the best metal bands on Earth. This album killed that. The songs are weak. The edge that made them great is gone.
1,"tyring to hard is like sabotge, sucks bad","comercialize,sterilize,megadeths demize, dave tried for number 1 on the charts and crashes his wave to the top for good."
2,A Great EP!,"I love 'Deth. Heck, I wanted to be Dave Mustaine when I was growing up, but even my adoration can't save this album. Here's how it goes....First four tracks are solid.The remaining tracks are uninspired and boring. Is that Nick Menza or a drum machine stuck on the same beat? The acid-tongue of Mustaine is gone here. The power and fury that dwindled on Countdown to Extinction has been snuffed out.The only reason I still own this disc is because of the first four tracks. It would make a great EP."
2,megadeth's worst album,"this album suffers from poor production (which mustaine now admits). There are three good songs ""reckoning day"" ""train of consequences"" and ""a toute le monde"". The rest of this album is countdown to extincton watered down even more. Alot of cheesy background vocals as well. If you want to hear good megadeth get ""peace sells"" or ""Rust in peace"", or any other megadeth cd except maybe ""risk""."
3,Way of the mark,"Reckoning Day is good, Train Of Consequences is great. Addicted To Chaos is the hardest song. Victory is a great use of all the old song titles. Other than that, this sucks. Black Curtains and Youthanasia sound exactly the same. A Tout le Monde is slow and boring. What's the deal with the French? Family tree is just not good, i never lsitened to all of that song and I still haven't. Black Curtains isn't bad, but it isn't enough to pull the album up out of the muck. Thank God Cryptic Writings was a return to form. Just kind of skip over this album and go right on from Countdown to Cryptic."
5,Different But Good,Youthanasia is noticably different from earlier Megadeth releases. However this does not make the album bad. Most early Megadeth fans say that this is a selout.I disagree.I like early Megadeth and I like this also. I like it when bands change there style.I am glad that every one of Megadeth's albums do not sound exatly the same. I strongly recomend this album to metal fans. It is a masterpiece.
4,"Misunderstood, Under-appreciated","This album is as underrated, as it is misunderstood. Every album that Megadeth has ever done has been different from the other. They always keep it heavy, but are wholly willing to try anything new, so long as it is quality.I appreciate far more the thrash/speed metal Megadeth we all love, then, say, the ""Risk"" or ""World Needs a Hero"" MD, that takes getting used to or just isn't any good. Having said that, this album is high quality, as far as written material goes. True, don't expect ""Rust"" or ""CTE"" level decibles, but there is material to treasure here, I don't see how that can be in question.Most songs on here, while more metal than thrash, are extremely well written. I personally love the majority of the songs on this album.Check it out."
5,Great Album - Great Band,"This is a great album to have if you know you like Megadeth, although I favor RIP over this one. Megadeth is one of those bands who you can't really get the full gist of their music with only one CD- They have many albums that complement each other, this being a crucial one to have. Oh yeah, just to let everybody know- Dave Mustaine DIDN'T write all of the leads that you hear on Kill 'em All, but just the 4 seconds or so that each solo begins with (because the guys from Metallica wanted Kirk to start them that way) 95% of those licks on Kill em All are Kirk's (oh wait, I'm reviewing a Megadeth CD)- bottom line is this is a great album that you should buy if you know you like Megadeth- you'll know what I'm talking about after you listen to it."
4,"Good. SOme weak songs, but in general i very good.","More irregular than ""Rust in Peace"", nevertheless this CD is very good, mainly tha classic ""A TOut Le MOnde"", a master-piece!"
2,Not Too Engaging.,"I remember buying this a little while after it was released. I wasn't impressed with it at all. I listened to it either just once or twice. Rust in Peace is a lot better, or if you want to check some other groups out, try Celtic Frost or Coroner."
3,Youthanasia,Youthanasia being Megadeath's 6th studio album and their 1994 release is not the thrash metal one is used to but more of a heavy metal and hard rock album with softer guitar riffs then one is used to hear from this band. Whilst this not being bad it just sounds a little less forcefull then one is used to hear from this group. The booklet contains all the lyrics but not a list of whom plays what. Allmusic and Blender gave the album 3/5 and I agree with them and give the same. 3/5.
3,Pretty Good,"A good all around album but could have been better.It has its gems,but of all the megadeth albums I got tired of this one quicker than the others.The biggest complaint is that most of the songs sound the same,as if they didnt try to write the music as well as they could have but it still is a great metal album as all megadeth cds are! Hetfield and Hammett can only wish they could play riffs like Mustaine and Friedman!"
2,Not Good,"I give this CD two stars .One for each good song on the CD.There are two good songs on this record ""Train of Concequences"" and ""Youthanasia"" the rest is garbage.I see alot of 5 star reviews and i just dont get it.Theres no way this stuff can touch RUST or Peace Sells....come on.This CD is alot slower than albumns like Rust in Peace Peace sells,and even Countown to Extinction,but its not the speed of the music that bothers me.The music is just not aranged well.The Choruses are nowhere near as good as the ones on COUNTDOWN.It even seems like Marty Friedman is holding back.It seems to me like this CD is Megadeths answer to the Grunge music that was so popular at the time it came out.Not that it sounds grunge.Its just a very watered down sound.IF you are thinking about buying a MEgadeth CD for the first time I think you should buy RUST in PEACE or Countdown to Extinction.Get this one to fill out your collection."
5,It rules,"Anyone who dosen't think this album rules needs to get their thumbs out of their @$$'s and realize that Megadeth was doing something diffrent just like they've done for every album since and every album that will come. It's heavy as hell and STILL far beyond anything Kirk Hammet and James Hetfield could do with their Sh*tty guitar playing. I have no favorite song on this album because its immpossable to choose. As of now it is their last good album, lets not hope that is the case after AUGUST 31 when the new album is released."
4,Youthanasia 4/5,"Youthanasia must have one of the best starts in the history of heavy metal with 3 fantastic songs in a row. Reckoning Day/Train Of Consequences/Addicted To Chaos alone are enough to make this CD worthy of any metal collection.By then we are introduced to the first chords of A Tout Le Monde , and altought is not a bad song, it turns out to be the weakest of all the CD, it is a not so subtle song written with the live shows in mind. From there the album never goes to the brilliance of the first three songs, and sometimes seems a bit reashed from other Megadeth albuns, but it keeps a solid pace to the end with great solos and lyrics worthy of attention.Also worthy of mention on Youthanasia are the choruses on every song, simply brilliant.Youthanasia was clearly a move towards a more commercial side of Megadeth, but after almost 10 years after the release still is a must have for any Megadeth/heavy metal fan."
4,Megadeth....??!,"Well I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Megadeth. However I do enjoy there works, but Youthanasia is definitly one of the best they've done. Musically enlightning and lyrically inspiring, some of the best soloing I've ever heard. Dave and Marty have done homework in this one. Still my only quarrel with the album is the track Victory, where Dave incorperates song and album titles into the lyrics aka., Manowar in the album Kings of Metal the song Blood of the Kings in 1988. Thats the only reason I give it 4 stars, sorry Dave been done before. Still if your a fan and it is definatly worth getting"
5,old and v. good,"It was second hand album, as original remix is not easy available in the other way.The new version is disaster, original old album is great.Incredible how much can spoil ""improved"" more dynamic remix.Once again original version sounds like old school Megadeth, nothing more to add."
3,I just don't know,"Jesus crist I dont really know its not heavy as before. This isnot megadeth's best work it has good creation but I recommendcowntdown to Extinction. If you are a looking for the Heavy and beststuff from Megadeth try Rust in Peace and down to the first album but thisAlbum is good for a date or some female freind same goes with cowntdownto extinction which I like better. My favorite tracks are Reckoning Day, Trainof Conqueses,A tuot Le Monde(a slow track but sounds good),and ElysianFields."
3,"Megadeth's worst album, but still halfway decent","This is probably Megadeth's worst album. It is not bad, though. This is also probably their most radio friendly album. It just lacks the excitement of earlier albums like Killing is my Business and Business is Good, Peace Sells but Who's Buying, or Rust in Peace. There are some good songs on here, like Reckoning Day, Killing Road, and Victory. A Tout Le Monde is OK. However there is nothing on this album that compares to Megadeth classics like ""Rattlehead"" ""Black Friday"" or ""Set the World Afire"" If you like Megadeth, you should pick this album up, but not before their great albums like Killing is my Business and Business is Good, and Peace Sells but Who's Buying, or Rust in Peace"
5,A metal classic,"Perhaps the least accessible and most underrated album in the Megadeth catalogue. The angst level is at an all-time high (eat your heart out, Metallica). The lyrics are outstanding, the drum work is raw and noteworthy, the bass is solid, and one can only wonder why Marty Friedman is not a major guitar god. Perhaps he needs a catchier name?? My only complaint is that the vocals sometimes get buried in the mix. (Those who think Dave only just learned to sing on ""Cryptic Writings"" obviously missed this record, and ""Countdown to Extincinion,"" too, for that matter.) It's hard to pick a favorite track - they are all that good. My favorites include ""Addicted to Chaos"" ""A Tout le Monde"" ""The Killing Road"" ""Family Tree"" and ""I Thought I Knew,"" but really, I like 'em all."
5,Best Megadeth Album Yet!,This album is actually worth 10 stars. It is the best album Megadeth has produced both lyrically and musically. Megadeth RULES!
1,Cheap rip-off of a small German independent company's games,"Cheap is the active description. Rip-off is the verdict. If you want a great game, in the tradition of Elite and Privateer, turn to EgoSoft out of Germany. X-Beyond the Frontier, X-Tension, and the newly released X2-The Threat, all blow Microsoft's lame game to shame. Freelancer should be relegated to not the bargain-bin, (as it is now), but to the trash bin. And if you did play Freelancer, and actually liked it, then you will LOVE X2! And yes, they have an English version. And they continue to come up with add-ons - not ""patches"", but real additions to the game ala ""The Sims"", for free download by registered owners. Make money trading, owning factories, blowing up Pirates or other bad guys, and capture ships. Own a fleet of transports, fighters, corvettes, destroyers, battleships and carriers! Compared to X2 by Egosoft, Freelancer is a poor Craker Jacks prize. And Egosoft has been growing this franchise for a long, long time."
1,"Good form, bad flight","Overall I liked the game. It is the same great type of space flight simulator that we have come to love from this production team. However this game has some detractors that made me put it down and walk away. The primary and most serious of these problems is the flight control. The game is controlled exclusively by mouse. There is not even an option for joystick flight. I think their intenet was to make the HUD interface better. I had a horrible time with flying and shooting and the targeting system was off as well. The voice acting (at least in the demo) was pretty deadpan and uninspiring. The graphics were ok but not any better than Privateer 2. The only good aspect was that the ganme seemed more open-ended thatn P2 and the universe was larger. I recommend getting Privateer instead, at least until they (I wish) come out with another Privateer game."
4,Add a joystick!,"Just downloaded and tried out the demo. The graphics are excellent, and so is the sound. Definitely reminded me of the old Privateer game with two exceptions: No transport missions, and no joystick. I know there've been people saying that you won't miss it, but trying to track a rogue with the mouse is pretty darn tough on the ol' carpal tunnel syndrome. A patch giving you the option to fly with a joystick, and switch back to a mouse for neural net interface would raise this game to 5 stars. Other than that, I'm going to have to wait until after my CTS operation in order to play it again. Damn good game otherwise."
2,The most repetitive RPG ever made,"First, I will state right up front that it is pretty and the space combat engine is pretty nice to fly. Having said that, I will have to point out that all the combats play out basically the same. Every mission you get from the NPCs is essentially the same. All your canned face-to-face interactions with the NPC are pretty much the same. In about two hours of playing this, you will already be extremely tired of the repetitious conversations. The combat will hold its fascination a bit longer, but in the end, that too will start to seem really repititious. In essence... As a space sim, it lacks complexity and detail. As an RPG, it lacks depth and variety. This game was truly disappointing to me after reading all these glowing reviews."
3,its ok,Microsoft could have done so much more with this title. its a shame they let go by the way side like they did.
3,"story could be better, and needs joystick compatibility","this story starts with an odd yiew of an unknown station. then you get rocketed out. the station blows up. you become a good guy, but soon the ""good guys"" put you on the most wanted list for no good reason. it happens in every system, untill you are desperate for allies. then BOOOMMM!!!! you are back where you started, but with a full pardon. oh, and one more thing. Microsoft is the maker of my computer, so i won't insult them too much, but could they have had the brain capacity to make a joysick compatible game? the mouse takes away the essence of flying."
3,Pretty but repetitive,"For those of you who have played games like Elite, Privateer, BattleCruiser, Wing Commander, Independence War, etc.This game is a prettified version of Privateer. I was hoping it would be a replacement for Frontier: Elite 2 (released in 1993!)But nope. It really isn't much better than Independence War.Very disappointing for a 2003 title."
4,Freelancer review from a freelancer,"Freelancer is a great game with replay value. Had difficulty access MMORPG servers, still trying to find out how, that is kind of dissatisfying, but the graphisc and ease of play are very intriguing. I play this game often. One of the best Space games I have played."
5,a rare find and catch.. the game that I just LOVE,I love this game. I've been gaming for most of my life and even had a stint as a professional gamer for a year and from what I've seen this game is one of only a handful which I have truly truly enjoyed and see a long long shelf life with. Theres so many different ways to play this game in my opinion and it's so open ended it just has a place in my collection as extremely special. This game is fun with a capital F!I generally play strategy and first person shooters and rpgs.. but man I love playing a sci fi space game like this. I haven't played a space game since X-Wing and before that the WWII Aces of the Pacific fighter pilot game. I was smitten by the idea of privateer tho I never got to play it I was captured and my imagination was waiting for a game like this to come about.Hopefully Digital Anvil and Microsoft games continue to expand upon this game and make more!!!...
2,All About dogfights,"First, to give you my perspective - mid 30s male who plays games about 10 hours a week.Second - this game is all about a great engine for having dogfights in 3D space. Initially, it is very impressive and you feel like the Red Baron. But after a while it becomes a bit dull. They Keyboard flight and battles are not very difficult, but the endless rounds of air fights get tedious.Now, if you are a big flight simulator fan, then you might really enjoy this game. But if you want something different - some puzzles, some other form of fighting, something else, this game will leave you feeling empty."
4,Very Good Game Play,"Freelancer is as good as Privateer, with excellent game play and a strong story line. Although not without its short comings Freelancer is a very fun game at the current price. I agree with the comments regarding repetitive dialogue, and stale readings. At first I was not excited about using a mouse to control flight, yet I now find it enjoyable and the controls are great. Having played the multi-player I give it very high marks and enthusiastically recommend it. Going from 19 to 20 level has a bug that should be addressed, at least in my game. Of course the ""bug"" could be built in on the idea that there would be an expansion, which would be nice. In the end I still love this game and feel that its short coming are the result of losing key personnel during development. It just seems that the project reached a point where the publishers said ""Good enough"" and shipped it out."
3,Lack of Joystick Control,"Just be aware when buying this game, that the flight control system forces you to use the mouse. There is no support in the game for using a joystick in the flight/combat portions."
3,Too Short Too Easy,"I found this game too short and two easy. It only had 13 story line missions, and I only died a handful of times, it was no challenge. I finished the game within 2 days. I still have to explore the systems, but I won't be taking on any of the missions available in the bar as they are so repetitive.I found the story line to be very engaging and interesting to play, but I thought the ending was weak, and a bit is that all there is. I didn't like how you had to follow the story line to increase your fighting ability.The game this most reminded me of was privateer, but without the variety.I like the mouse control, but I do think it does need joystick support."
5,Even more fun with modern multiplayer updates,"Years after it's release, Freelancer remains a popular multiplayer platform with 600+ daily players from around the world. The most popular community modification to Freelancer is called Discovery, which adds dozens of new systems, ships, factions, and functionality to the game engine.Play as police or military for your favorite house, or be that truly evil character you could never been in the single player module. Fly previously locked ships such as tranports, gunboats, cruisers, and battleships.Simply purchase a copy of Freelancer then use your favorite search engine to search for ""Discovery PTC"" to get more information about the Discovery mod, and one of the most popular Discovery multiplayer servers, Discovery PTC.We look forward to seeing you in game!"
4,"Addicting, but...","I bought this game, I've played most of the way through the single player, and I'm currently finding very little reason to do the multiplayer. Here's why. All the non-story-driven missions are repetetive.The story is great, the missions that are a part of the story are great, and have some pretty good range. You'll get to fly escort to ships, scan cargo of ships, run for your life... It's not bad so far. What sucks is every side quest style mission is the same: Go here, shoot down everything in sight. There might be a base to destroy or someone to capture or assassinate, but it's done in the same way, blow it up. I would have liked to see missions where you can escort a convoy, run supplies, perform reconnaissance, stuff like that. The variation is a little lacking. I don't know, maybe there's more variety in the multiplayer mode, but I just don't think it's too likely. Otherwise, this is a seriously addicting game. After work, I've been playing it almost nonstop. Check it out."
5,Best Space Flight Sim of this Century (so far),Overall excellent 21st century hybrid of RPG/Wing Commander/Colony Wars/Privateer with minor drawbacks. The main plot line for the single player is great but the neccesary experience-gaining missions are very repetitive.
4,Smashing,Great game to play takes a little getting used to.The higher you get the harder the game is to play
1,Identity crisis,"Freelancer can't seem to figure out what kind of game it is.The marketing says it is a game directed by the way you play. In practice, it has a very linear plot that you are railroaded into following.If you want to play as a trader or miner, the marketing says it will support you. In practice, combat is thrust upon you so freqeuntly that you have little choice but to get a ship built for war.The marketing says it has role-playing elements. In reality, it is an action game with cut-scenes showing the plot.It is too simple to be a great space combat sim, but the combat is too hard for it to be an RPG. The choices are few and usually binary. I wanted Morrowind in space. I got frustration and disappointment."
4,Not bad but not stellar,"I'm a fan of the work of the Robert brothers all the way back to wing commander days. I like how Freelancer takes off were Starlancer ends (The Alliance is fighting a losing war against the Coalition *no more spoilers*). I'm not crazy about using the mouse for flight and the interface takes a little getting use to. This game would be real nice if the joystick and/or keyboard were open options for flight control.Pros, awesome flight graphics but I think a little extra work could have been done on the character models though even though they do look decent with good shadowing (characters in Starlancer looked better even w/o shadowing).I havn't finished the game yet but the story is good so far. I would recommend this to anyone into space-sims but not hardcore players."
3,but I don't go to clubs...,"modern trippy house music with buddhist related images. Not buddhism as I understand it, and not what I expected. Oh well...."
4,este power es lo mejor,"tengo una ecs black p78g + phenom 3x tv tuner, una ati 3870 x2 y mas el consumo es perfecto este power rinde esto es de por vida."
3,Provides Power Like it's Supposed to,"I bought this to power my GeForce 9800 GTX. It woks fine. The fan is reasonably quiet. My only complaint is that the cabling is a little stiff. I've only had it for about a month. So I couldn't tell you how it holds up over time yet. I could have gotten something cheaper, but I would be worried about it's reliability."
4,Entertaining with nice graphics,"I played this game with my 6-yo daughter and 3-yo son. They love it and can't get enough of it. The one thing I would recommend is doing the virtual reality tutorial first and listening to the demos to help you make the avatar move. Otherwise it can be frustrating to both you and your child, as another reviewer mentioned. My kids were even finding it amusing to watch Barbie fall down the hole or get swallowed by quicksand over and over again, at first, but once they knew how to make her climb, tumble, push and pull heavy objects, swing from vines, and do monkey bars, they had more fun. I have been a cautious fan of Barbie over the years, not loving her unrealistic body type. But I do like how Barbie does these very physical tasks and has fun and adventure doing them in this game."
4,interesting perspective,"Gives a clear picture of life and the world of an Arab in Israel. It's nicely written, easy to read, and makes the reader think. It also gives a good picture of a boy growing up, going through the issues of every day life, dealing with failure, school, money, friends and family, etc."
2,"Strange, strange, strange","I guess I like stories with some point. Not sure I found one in this book. For contrast, I found the film ""Infidel"" which deals with a similar subject much more enjoyable."
3,Charlotte Temple Review,"This novel was written with the intention to help young women who are on their way to womanhood. This story became America's first best selling novel in the earliest years of the Republic. It is about a girl named Charlotte Temple. She is seduced by a british soldier (Montraville) who takes her to America. She is promised marriage upon arrival, but it never falls through. She is away from her home, friends, and family. She is alone and pregnant at 15 years of age. What is she going to do?"
5,Better Homes and Gardens wins again!,Made planning some good lighting ideas for a new construction house a whole lot easier. Clearly explains some needed basic principles and considerations. I was able to communicate with our electrical contractor on a more informed level than I ever would have been without first going through another winner from the BH&G lineup of home related books.
4,take me away,"Take me away by Haji and emanuel makes this compilation worthy.A unique track with emphatic vocals especially the refrain ""take me away"" which can put you in different mood level.Both the progressive rhythm and tune uplift you and can make you stop thinking for 8 minutes.If there is a competition for a best house track of the year this one is undoubtedly number 1.Simply masterpiece able to break every dancefloor if I have to rate this track I will put 10 stars.The other outstanding track is Deux -Sun rising up,maybe one of the favourites of eric morillo this year,putting it in one of his sets on January 15 in Miami and continuing throughout the whole year.The other tracks cannot attain this high class set by the mentioned above ones but the still contribute to and diversify somehow the overall tone of the compilation like the relaxing motives by Barbara Tucker."
1,Genova products have problems,"The problem with Genova gutter parts is the connecting tabs. They are the weak link in the process. Even wit the proper tool, the tabs are very prone to either giving way, or flat out breaking off. I bought this slip joint to replace a broken one, guess what happened? The replacement broke as well"
1,horrible,"It's not worth the $$$ the graphics r horableonly 8 sk8ers i would give it a 0 if i couldit is probably the worst game everDON""T BUY THIS GAME"
1,Do not buy this game!!!!,"Do not buy this game! If I could give this a 0 star rating, I would. It's not worth the $$$ I payed for it and it's not anywhere close to the quality of Tony Hawke 2 for GBA. When I did buy this game, I played it for about 5 minutes and quickly realiized that it's a terrible game. This is because it plays kind of linear. The screen goes back and forth and not up or down and in street mode it is a rough transition from one ramp to another. This in its self takes too long. So, don't buy this game at all. Buy Tony Hawke 2 and Tony Hawke 3, when it comes out on GBA in March 2002."
1,ESPN What are you doing?,"I have had the misfortune to play this game, before I start If there is anyone reading this that thinks this game is anything like Tony Hawks you will be greatly dissapointed. I persisted with this game and played it for about 30 minutes, after which I would have been happy to never see this game again. The game play is terrible, with the graphics changing aspect ratio quicker than a Quentin Tarantino film, one minute you have a side profile then back to an over head view, all the time wondering if the writers were on some mind bending drugs, if they think its good thay should be sent to the hospital for tests. The only reason that I gave it 1 star was because I couldn't enter any less. Be warned, don't buy this game unless you want to be really disapointed, and if you do make sure you can get a refund. ESPN X Games Skateboarding, JUST SAY NO."
1,Do not buy this game!!,"Do not buy this game!! If I could give this a 0 star rating, I would. It's not worth the [money] I payed for it and it's not anywhere close to the quality of Tony Hawke 2 for GBA. When I did buy this game, I played it for about 5 minutes and quickly realiized that it's [not a good] game. This is because it plays kind of linear. The screen goes back and forth and not up or down and in street mode it is a rough transition from one ramp to another. This in its self takes too long. So, don't buy this game at all. Buy Tony Hawke 2 and Tony Hawke 3, when it comes out on GBA in March 2002."
4,Good value,For the price this does everything expected and not only protects agianst power loss but protects from other power fluctions. This is also much more compact than an older unit that used a lead acid battery.
2,"""High Quality"" is an overstatement","The words ""High Quality"" on the cover are a blatant overstatement. It seems I could have downloaded the material off the Internet and printed it out myself; the only difference is this one has a bootleg cover to it.Aside from my dissatisfaction with the look of it, the book was a real work of art---Percy Lubbock is a master of literary criticism. On the whole, it was very enlightening and fun."
3,Held up for six months,"The cover is very soft, but my home is full of tiny feathers that poke through the cover; far more than expected. I would not purchase this item again. The ""down leaks"" got much worse after about six months. I am pulling feathers out of my hair every morning. Perhaps a high thread-count duvet cover would solve this problem. I have also found that the down has shifted into little pockets at the edges of the comforter."
1,Poor performance of this comforter,"I am extremely disappointed to learn that with less than two weeks' use the stitching has come loose in many of the squares and that the down has shifted. Not only is it uncomfortable, it is unsightly to say the least.I had purchased this for my son's room. He is in the Air Force and had not been home until recently, therefore, I had no way of knowing that the product was so poorly constructed before my return 'window' had expired. I would not recommend to anyone."
2,feathers clump up,I just got all new bedding and i'm not thrilled with this down comforter. I've only had it for a couple of weeks and the feathers have gathered up into the middle and one side. My side just feels empty like layers of plain sheets. I've snapped it out trying to redistribute feathers but it doesn't seem to help. If anyone has any tips on evening out feathers in a down comforter i'm open to hearing them.
1,...,I was very unhappy with the purchase I made. The feathers from the down comforter kept coming out and creating a bigger mess in my room.
2,Incredible Fit: Yeah Right,"These gloves are made of poor quality leather with dreadful stitching. Additionally, contrary to what the description of the gloves say, the fit is hard from legendary.You truly get what you pay for, I do not recommend this product."
3,I expected more,It did not sit on the hands smoothly and stitches are not good quality. Leather quality is good nice and smooth
2,Not sure it works as well as it should,Jury's out on this product. My biggest quibble is that it is sooo expensive online when you factor in shipping. However it may not be less expensive than in the grocery store so you'll just have to see how it stacks up in your area. 4 oz doesn't go very far.
1,It was not RID!!!,I ordered RID for my daughter through here and I got a cheap generic brand that did not work and leaked in the box it was delivered in and now I have to go to a drug store to get the real thing!
5,great quality product,"I use this for cuts, soap crafting, cleaning, to make feet spray, and as a facial astringent. The product is 100% tea tree oil and a quality product."
4,strong,this is really strong oil but still. very gentle on the skin. I got it based on amazon posted reviews. It looks like the product will last for a long time. I will buy again.
5,Quality Always!,I use this tea tree oil for breakouts works like a charm. Each and every time the quality is CONSISTENT which I greatly value in any products I use.
5,Tea tree oil,"Tea tree oil has long been praised for its fine health properties.Being a longtime user,,Desert Essence is the key factor in this review.This brand makes the best tea tree oil ,with great results.While the price might be a bit steep,the results are worth the price"
3,cant handle the smell,"I go back to this product every now and then to try to help with acne breakouts and I just can not handle the smell, it is SO strong and lasts at least 10-15 minutes, long enough to give me a headache from it, and I use maybe 1 drop on a wet cotton ball and its still too strong. :("
5,The easiest and best-tasting cookbook I have EVER used!,"This cookbook has helped me cook meals the way I have always dreamed of (seriously!): absolutely delicious and EASY to prepare and cook...this is from someone who was never taught how to cook anything other than boiling water for pasta and/or scrambling eggs. Now I'm cooking recipes like ""roasted pork medallions with balsamic-honey glaze"", ""scallops provencale"" (restaurant quality...reminds me of a dish from a very well known restaurant in Houston), ""saucy mini meat cakes (delicious little personal sized meat loafs), and ""salmon teriyaki"" just to name a few. I actually look forward to cooking now...especially since my husband and daughter are thrilled. I am going to buy lots of these cookbooks as gifts!"
4,A shopping list and easy-to-prep menu in two-pages,"Great cookbook for fairly new cooks and after-work meals. My recent-college-grad son and I have enjoyed testing the recipes together and he has become a confident ""chef."" Recipes vary, but the best are tasty, healthy and present as if they took much more effort (although 30 minutes is a bit optimistic). Favorites: Sesame-crusted salmon and turkey with garlic-mushroom-cream sauce."
5,Gourmet Quality Cookbook,"This cookbook is so easy to use. I love the way it is layed out with all the ingredients and shopping list included in each meal. Meal planning is so much easier.The Pork medallions in savory apricot sauce was wonderful, and so easy to do.I also made the shrimp scampi which was wonderful and smelled delicious and tasted even better. Everyone loved it.I would highly recommend this cookbook for busy cooks. It also is great for a gift."
4,Good but not cheap.,"These filters do what they are supposed to do, keep the tank water clean but I feel that for what they are that they are a little overpriced."
3,Doesn't last as long as expected.,The original filter that came with the aquarium (Eclipse Hex 5)seemed to keep the tank cleaner longer. The water is getting cloudy after only 1 week and I only have 1 fish!It is however very easy to install.
4,Classic Neil,"If you like Diamond's early songs done with the same punch and edge he had then this is the CD for you. You can hear his maturation over time, but these are his no frills songs that started his career. I wish there were fewer obscure songs on the CD, but they too are a revelation of his development. Very worth it for Neil Diamond fans. Karen Weaver"
3,"Not the Live album I was expecting, which is my fault.","OK, I should have looked more carefully, but I actually thought I was buying Neil's Live at the Troubadour record of the exact same title, which is fantastic (can still recall listening to my parents' vinyl version over and over). So benefit from my late-night inattention; this is a good greatest-hits collection but it isn't the great live album..."
5,I bought it for my Kindle,And it arrived immediately. Someday I'll read it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
3,A classic review,"I received the used cassette in good condition, and could listen to the full story without problems. It was entertaining, and it's a classic but doesn't leave you with anything of value. Not something I would pass down to my kids. A one time experience only, which means I might sell it myself on amazon.com :-)"
3,Is it genius?,"When I read A Woman of No Importance, I realized that I have read it before. Though, not by the same author. It is drastically similar to the French Play Le Fils Naturel, by Alexandre Dumas, jr. Though, it was a really nice play, it dragged in many places."
5,A Woman of no Importance,"I've just started re-reading this play and I think it is one of the most beautiful works Wilde ever wrote. Mrs. Arbuthnot's speech at the end of Act Four, beginning ""men don't know what mothers are"" is one of the most beautiful pieces I've ever read in Wilde. It's a very ironic speech, considering it was written by a man, but it shows what a wonderful insight into women Wilde had. The play is essentially about morality and the conflict between a person's own, private sense of morality and the moral values imposed on us by society. Ultimately, Mrs. Arbuthnot is the character who most deserves our respect, precisely because she refuses to buy into the moral values of those around her. Reading it, I can just imagine how it would be performed, I even find myself acting the play out in my head, such is the power and force of Wilde's dialogue. This is a truly beautiful work which I highly recommend"
3,Plot doesn't co-exist comfortably with the wit,"This play, while well-worth reading for the multiple examples of Wilde's famed wit, suffers because he never finds a way to fully integrate the witty one-liners and the moralistic plot. It's like reading two plays have that been clumsily stitched together. The longer declamations by the ""good"" characters have not aged gracefully. The modern reader will walk away remembering the wit much more than the plot."
3,"Window ""Roll-up"" Module for Crime Stopper System","Unit requires that you hold the lock button on the remote until the windows begin to move then they will continue up on their own. But they do no ""roll up"" just because you lock the doors which is kind of odd."
1,A Very Shoddy Product,"This book is not what it advertises itself to be. It is certainly not an almanac. I look to almanac to get up to date information, facts, and statistics. This book is simply a rehasing of old Encyclopedia Britannica entries. Most of the information is hopelessly out of date; for example, a lot of the facts on Countries of the World are from the mid-1980s. If you're looking for a real almanac, you'll have to look elsewhere."
4,one faced wonder,"the title song in this album runs in the original ""a"" face for 12+ minutes. it doesn't loose momento for disco fans. the other 2 songs are irrelevant. they are both around 8 minutes each & listen to them if you want, but they can't compare. buy the whole CD for COME ON DANCE, DANCE... is worth"
4,"Worth it for ""Come On Dance Dance"" alone.","This is one of the better disco songs in existence, with this version at over 11 minutes."
2,Scholarship mixed with some personal animosity?,"The book was interesting in that it traces the history of Japan's eroticized interactions with the West. The points it makes are not new - that yes, Japanese women's relationships with white man can often be a bid for greater power and agency, but this preference can also prop up Western hegemony.I found rather unpleasant though, a very visceral dislike Kelsky brings to the very idea of these relationships. This makes her scholarship quite suspect because her aim seems to be in every case, to show that Japanese women as a whole, are 'losers'. I had to laugh out loud at some of the chapters in that book, which seemed straight off these angry message boards in which West Coast white women rage about how white men are abandoning them in droves and going for Asian women, because they are ----- fill in the blanks with your favorite Asian stereotype.So, the history was interesting but its obvious that the author has more than a few prejudices herself..."
1,"This book is so prejudiced, a bad ethnography","I think Kelsky sees part of Japan and generalise as a whole... And Japanese women are not likely to honestly tell what we really think in our minds in front of Westeners but just say something white people expect to hear, as Japanese women regard Westeners as outsiders. So, for white men and women, it is really hard to know what we really think. But they tend to take the words as it is. You may not know, but Japanese women very often make fun of white men and women as ugly, fat, bald or etc. I feel very sorry but many Japanese women often say this ... So many of us have no adoration to Westners. If you want to believe what Kelsky maintains, just believe it. Many Westners want to believe themselves to be admired, so it is helpless. But if you do so, you will never know much about Japanese people and culture."
3,Hard to rate...,"so I put my rating right in the middle. The previous reviewer hopes that people ""who don't know anything about Asia"" will abstain from submitting reviews, but ours is a free world so thankfully nobody will listen to him.Kelsky writes well, which makes for compelling reading here, except in those parts that are loaded with anthropological jargon. Like writers, she has her biases, in her case against white men who have relationships with Japanese women. But her book is hard to put down."
1,The Tale of the Finicky Fax,"After setting up the HP 4110 unit to my computer, phone line and answering machine I sat and waited for the faxes to arrive. To my sadness I heard fax after fax attempting to engage the unit, but the HP 4110 remained deaf to the fax tones. After a 1 hour call to HP customer support the person on the other end stated: this unit will only work in tandem with an analogue answering machine and if there is any static on the phone line, the unit will not engage into the fax mode. It's been a long time since I've seen an analogue answering machine (remember the type with two tapes?) on the market and even longer since I've encountered a phone line that is 100% static-free. I returned the unit to Office Depot and received a full refund. Beware of All-in-One machines, they are too good to be true."
3,Don't expect too much,"Obviously this unit is a powerful and slim piece that you will keep it for a while. Unfortunately, the accompanying sw is a bit fussy and extreme slow in my PIII 933 machine with 512MB ram. Even you call up the change settings dialogue take you almost 10 seconds. The printer driver does not offer much for you to choose from, for example, you can;t simply tell the printer to print a doc in black and white when it contains some color in it.You don't even expect to save your fax in the PC where HP does not offer this option.Epson prints photo much better than HP, you find your photo is much darker comparing to what you actually see in your PC screen. To honor good quality, you have to make your image brighter by trial and error before you got what you actually expect.While the price is low relative to what HP offer in this unit ... Don't expect too much."
5,A Competent But Noisy Little Thing,"I found the ink cartridge carrier assembly quite noisy and its movements confounding but none-the-less, the small-footprinted jewel is a good worker in all aspects of its abilities. I had an HP Officejet 330 for 4 years and the 4110 Officejet has taken its place and earned it as well. The printing is silent and fast with excellent quality.Too many users think that $150.00 should buy them all of the multifunctional bells and whistles in the world but it won't. What it will get you is a simple, solid machine which faxes, prints, copies and scans quite adequately.I have excercised each of its features fully and do not hesitate to reccommend it as an inexpensive all-in-one printer for just about any home or office application."
3,3 1/2 years of moderate satisfaction.,"I bought this product around April of 2004 which replaced my old Xerox all-in -one. Overall I have been satisfied. The 4110 has certainly lasted longer than the average unit of this price. The print quality is good, but not stellar by 2007's standards. The scanning feature is okay for text, but will prove problematic for photos since it has an ADF and not platen.For basic home/office usage I would say the 4110 was an adequate machine for me. I just recently purchased a 5610 on sale since I upgraded my computer system to Windows Vista Basic. I'm told it will be compatible. Right now I'm just waiting for the cartridges to empty on my old 4110.Out with the old, in with the new."
1,HP Ahead in race to bottom,"This is by the worst HP product I've ever owned. I can wait until the cartidge run dry and I can scrap it. Noisy, slow, constantly jams. The process to replace ink has to be done all the time and involves a lot of hassle - alignment and scanning and so on. I've had it work right. Run from this one."
1,It is horrible,"My parents bought this printer because of its fax scan and print capability. I personally own a *almost* brand new HP laptop less than a year old. We configured this computer over the network so i could print. Well, it works fine... until you reboot. When you reboot, and go back into word, and try to change fonts, it will crash. I even did a factory install. Didn't change anything. HP doesn't have any support email for this on the site. The greedy people at HP also decided to not support network printing on this computer, thinking you should buy 1 HP printer per computer. Now i am going to go buy a new printer out of my pocket, and go as far as to pay 10 times more to get a brand that isn't related to HP. By the way, i'm not 12, i just didn't want to have to sign up for Amazon.com to complain about this poorly made product."
5,Great book for creative writing classes,"Ms. Senn has written a book that can be used effectively in creative writing classes.As a community college English instructor, I'm usingThe Many Faces of Journaling with my students. Some of the male students complain at firstbecause they think this is a ""girl's book."" After a week, they startsaying they enjoy the writing exercises. I'm glad I found this book oneday while browsing the Web at amazon.com."
2,Not what I hoped for,This book was ok but it was really not what I was looking for. I was looking for a more practical step by step guide which I found in another book.
5,*The Group of stars*,Ufonia is a extremely talented group. With the 5 of the musicians they make great music! Be sure to buy their music asap!
2,"Nice long plane, low quality foam","The glider can fly nice and long, but it is very fragile. Glue the wings and insert the rear elevator (wing) upside down, and throw it gently straight forward. Avoid any hard surfaces or pieces will fall off when it hits the ground. The foam material quality is for packaging, not for toys."
1,Disappointed,I ordered the Ultra Flyer after purchasing a similar product from Target. The Target item was a great plane and lasted a long time. The new Ultra Flyer planes I ordered would not stay together. The wings kept falling off and they would not fly. I contacted the company and they did not answer my e mail.
1,Garbage. The styrofoam breaks very easily.,"If I could rate 0 stars, I would. Imagine having a 7-year old jump up and down and tell you you're the ""best daddy ever!"" when you take this plane out of the box. He had been asking for one for several months. We then go outside to throw it together and the nose broke off on the first throw. After taping it back on, the tail broke off on the second throw. The disapointment I had to see my son go through was worse than throwing away the money I paid for this plane. To picture this stryofoam, think packing peanuts that protect items when shipped."
1,Wings fall out when thrown,This plane is designed so poorly that the wings fall out whenever you try to throw it. They don't fit tightly enough into the fuselage.
1,Very fragile,"the wings would not stay in. After gluing them on, it's first flight broke the tail. I glued the tail and reinforced with toothpicks. The next flight broke the nose and a piece of the tail wing. If your intent is teach how to repair a crappy styrofoam airplane, it's this would be a good choice."
1,6309 Ultra Flyer 4.5' review,"WELL, i'd love to write a good review on how the kids loved this foam plane (after i glued the broken tail back on). But i won't. It was shipped poorly and the tail section was broke in half and i had to spend money on a special glue that wouldn't melt the foam and it was more time consuming to fix it and find the glue than it would have been to buy a new one or not buy a new one but just have bought a cheaper one from the store that i could see wasn't broken ahead of time. Good luck if you purchase this item."
1,At least these reviews put a smile back on my son's face,"5 minutes after going outside, my son returned in tears - the plane in pieces. I hopped on here and the other reviews exactly mirrored our experience. This is a complete rip-off."
3,Not like the ones from the old days.. but not terrible by any means.,"Back in the 90's these things used to be made out of a way more dense foam, and they flew great and had decent instructions. Now these ones are super lightweight and the wings just fall out way sooner than they ought to. I mean... they're not terrible, but they make no mention of putting weight in the nose to get them to fly right.. because out of the bag they don't fly right. Anybody who knows anything about model airplanes will quickly put a hunk of metal in the nose to rectify this, but straight out they don't fly all that well without modification. OK... they don't fly at all."
2,HARDLY A FIRE-RY ALBUM,"Having always enjoyed the music of Tanya Tucker, this is probably my least favorite album. There are a couple good tracks such as ""Between the Two of Them"", ""Love Will"", but as a whole this album is definitely not to be compared with her smash album ""Can't Run From Yourself"" or even the less commericalized ""Soon"" or ""Complicated"" albums. ""Fire to Fire"" is for only die-hard Tanya fans. If you want a GREAT Tanya album I would recommend the albums mentioned above or her ""Tanya"" album."
3,A love album; simply OK.,"Not one of her best. There's one upbeat song in this circus of ballads. Tree stand-out tracks just isn't enough when you compare with her other CD's. Nothing much, nothing less.1. I love this slow-number. Catchy melody Haunting and beautiful. 3/52. Heartbreaking ballad about splitting up and deciding who gets what. 5/53. About the woman in her ex' life. Slow song, but very deep and nice melody. 4/54. Up-tempo. Very catchy tune, but lyrics don't catch up. 4/55. Yuck. 1/56. Slow song dedicated to her parents. So beautiful and catchy. 5/57. Another heartbreak song. 4/58. About telling mr Right that then was then and this is now. Ballad. 5/59. What is this? 1/510. Another ballad. 2/5"
4,Better than the Movie,"Star Trek V, the Novel, is much better than the movie. There is so much more depth and adventure that the movie really shows that it was cut up pretty badly in post production. Even though this is one of the weakest of the Star Trek movies, it is still great reading!"
3,Description,"Although she had spent all her life in Greece, young Serra Costalos was only half Greek -- and she couldn't endure the thought of the cold-blooded, arranged Greek marriage that was all that was in store for her.In fact, she had already run away from home when, quite by chance, she met the English-man Dirk Morgan and discovered that he was looking for a wife. But a wife with a difference. Dirk had to marry in order to inherit a fortune, and, as he was a self-confessed rake and had no intention of changing his ways, he wanted a wife who would leave him alone and not make a nuisance of herself.So Serra and Dirk married. But neither of them got what they expected."
5,A really good book!,This has become one of my favorite books and should be on every teen reading list.
5,Attitude of a srvant,This book is a wonderful reference tool for any leadership class. It lays an awesome foundation that coincides with Matthew 20:27 and is a must have for any emerging leader in the church and the secular world. The principles in this text are timeless! I recommend it highly!
4,A neat and useful dictionary!,"I like this little dictionary very much. It contains most of the up to dated slang or expressions that we heard from movies, co-workers and TV. I can find more than 95% of the expressions I want to know in this neat and useful dictionary. It is also made of good quality paper and won't wear out easily. I recommend it to all foreign students, new comers just arrive North America, or even to those who want to know our latest colloquial expressions."
2,Not quiet as expected,"I expected to find a comprehensive dictionary for slang expressions and idioms, but I still had a hard time comprehending web sites and follow talks, because I found only few and easy to understand idioms in this book. Also the overlapping between this book and ""American Idioms Dictionary"" is disappointing."
5,The best kipper snacks around....,Really enjoyed these and whats great is that these have half the salt of brunswick kippers
4,Packaging,"We really enjoy the King Oscar Kipper Snacks. The only problem we have with them is the packaging. When we try to open them, the key breaks off and it is almost impossible to get them open. We have eaten this product for years and have not had this problem until recently. Have you changed something?"
2,Poor Quality,"I used to eat these when I was a kid and loved them. You'd open the can and there would be two or three whole, flaky fillets inside with the skin still on. They were excellent. Perhaps I got a bad can this time, but these were just awful. Like opening a can of cat food. An unidentifiable mass of smashed fish meat. Ick."
5,A weindow to the world of Berbers,"This book opens a wondow to the world of Berber culture. It is written with love and care about local people. Like those who this book is about are family members of the Author. And you know, what if family for North African - is may be most important in the life."
3,urgency!,"i don't have any idea with the sedimentation but i have to make a related on this topic, thesis. how cann i know that what kind of book that suitable for me. what kind of model that i going to used. please inform me, thank you for your listening to thsi voice from far away country like thailand. thank you very much indeed.your sincere, Supree leeratanaruk master degree student at Sirindhorn international institute of technology, thammasat University, bangkok, thailandnamwaan69_1@yahoo.com"
5,Awesome Book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It gave a very clear and vivid picture of the life of young women or women in general under the rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan. It's filled with suspense, sadness, joy..all in one book.I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family to read it."
5,The Truth About the Taliban,"Letifa is a valuable eye-witness to the terror the Taliban visited upon it's own people. With the help of Pakistan, these fanatics pursued a policy of anhilation of the Afghani people, particulary, the women. These are the same evil people who bombed our World Trade Center on September 11th. They are truly anti-life. Letifa's book gives me yet another reason to feel good about my country's role in freeing Afghanistan from the evil Taliban. Letifa and her family are all Muslem but they found the Taliban version of ""Islam"" unrecognizable. It is to religion what cancer is to healthy cells. May it be erradicated!"
3,"Could have used a competent editor, but good effort","This book jumps around a lot. The author could have used a better editor. Since this book deals with a lot of historical aspects of growing up in Afghanistan, a linear format would have worked better than the back and forth the author uses. One day her brother's fighting the Soviets. Then he's married in another country, then he's fighting the Soviets. You get the idea. It's a little hard to keep track of who's doing what.As to the descriptions of the author's life, however, it was pretty good, but I don't feel she adequately captured the horrors of what was going on, at least not compared to other books I've read on the subject. More detail and expansion would have been good.However, the book was very good, especially from one so young. I do recommend it."
1,Amateurish effort,"This book is very light reading and does not tell you anything more about recent afghan history or life under the Taliban than what most people already know just from watching TV or reading newspaper articles.It is also very short on details. For example, you do not get any idea how the author's family managed to lead a relatively comfortable lifestyle when their father had no income and there is virutally no description of day to day life in Kabul-other than the punishments meted out by the Taliban- from 1992 to 2001.It is a very simple and superfically told narrative that may appeal to children in the 8-10 age group.I am surprised it found its way to the history section of the Berkely Heights library.This book is too elementary for adults."
3,Interersting,"This is a translation and it's not really a great read, but it's an interseting story nonetheless. You can through it pretty quickly, though."
2,A lightweight account,"This is a short book about a girl growing up in Afghanistan and it ends abruptly. Personal accounts of hardship are difficult to turn into good literature unless woven into the historical and political context of the country (as is done in Reading Lolita in Tehran) or reflect a poetry and imagery which counterbalances the mundane (as in The Diary of Anne Frank, with which this book is compared). That said, the writer makes a good job of describing the times leading up to the Taliban regime and the factual horror of that time. The book became more interesting once she started trying to do something about it, and began her small school. I would recommend this book for younger readers who know nothing about Afghanistan, and for those who want a quick account of its horrors through the eyes of a woman. For a much better and more in depth account, I'd go for the Sewing Circles of Herat."
4,Telling it like it is.,"This may not be a professionally written book, it does not contain profound insights, but it does tell us how it was for one young girl effectively condemned for her sex. If I'd read this in isolation, I might have doubted some of what she says, but any moderately informed adult knows of many other sources that say the same. (Some of the low-star reviews are quite obviously from foolish children or Muslim men who like their women subservient.)Flaws in the writing - at times it seems to ramble a bit, jumping back and forward into history, but aside from that, I have no quibble. It does not contain exhaustive description, and nor does it contain any deep analysis of politics, but this is just a young woman telling it how it was for her. I found it a deeply depressing read, and wonder just how it is that so many men can feel such an utter hatred for women."
2,Unofficial at best,"the halcyon days DVDs are a series of interviews by people who were near the band during the times they each describe. Oddly enough, the soundtrack includes Metallica songs played by another group. The only Metallica footage seems to be the HBO footage from Woodstock '94, which is shown throughout the feature, whenever a song is mentioned that was on that setlist.Cliff 'em All is a much better glimpse into the band's early career."
1,metallica-halcyon days,"Anything I can view about Metallica is O.K., since I'm a new fan. This was not up to what I was hoping for: 1. not authorized by the band 2. more feedback from european journalists than I'd like 3. more negative feedback from ALL, which I don't care to see, after spending money on a product. If I could have, I would have returned it."
1,I know death metal and this blows,"ok, hate eternal has the fastest double bass drummer in the business. that's the only reason why this album gets a star. otherwise, the production is awful, and the vocals are generic and muted out by the guitars. the songwriting isn't as catchy as napalm death and cryptopsy, and the riffs are awful so u can't remember the music while u are staring out a window in chemistry class... screw hate eternal, get pig destroyer and dillenger escape plan"
4,... go ahead and run ... run home and cry to mama!,"I tend to go with the hardest, fastest and angriest metal ... no compromise ... music that takes no prisoners ...But THIS ... THIS IS TOTALLY MERCILESS!!!It should be emblazoned with a government health warning - every track comprises of a merciless, hate-filled attack on the senses!This album is an extremely technical and brutal statement ... is this the beast that metal's evolving into? Am I getting too old? Where did I put my old Suffocation and Morbid Angel CDs?I'm giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5 'cos I've been too scared to play it ...MAMA!!!"
4,Blast beat assembly line,"What we have here is a factory churning out blast beats. This is immediately followed by.....even more blast beats! Now don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing. Roddy is a drumming MACHINE. The other two band members aren't exactly technical slouches either. Dare I say, I like Hate Eternal even more than their godfather, Morbid Angel? I haven't heard their first album so I won't pass that judgment just yet. If you like your metal brutal and unrelenting, sort of like a freight train, go ahead. Pick it up. Just make sure you like blast beats first."
2,Hold on tight......,"Hate Eternal is cirtainly one of the most talented death metal bands of the modern day. The brutality is incredible, Roddy is an amazing drummer. I think that this album though great , Is quite repeditive, I think that bands like Vital Remains, and Bloodbath have proved you can have melodic interludes , Instead of constant brutality, with no texture. They really need to work some variations of diffrent dynamic textures, as it is this record is very boring."
3,"""Metagore""","The new Drummer on this album really hurts Hate Eternal.Though he plays really fast and has good kicks his drumming does not complement Erick Rutan or Jared Andersons music.There first album makes this one sound really weak!Its just straight blast and no feel.I think they need to get Tim ""the missle"" back and can Mr.Roddy.I had high hopes for this album and was let down."
5,Classic,"This has become one of my favorite death metal CDs, with In Their Darkened Shrines and Deranged's Plainfield Cemetery, King of All Kings is just blast beats the entire CD, what the hell else could you ask for. It is like Panzer Division Marduk for death metal. Some idiots say bands now are just making fast music for the sake of being fast...yeah? so what? This is death metal, its amazingly breakneck and heavy, and it is mighty, believe me. Get it, the CD is ridiculously intense live, see them if you can."
3,Glitchy ambience,"This album of glitchy ambience begins with chilly minimalism in the vein of Mille Plateaux. The sound then opens up, moving freely from pastoral to emotive to ethereal. Synth and found sounds go through the digital blender a la Blevin Blectum, culminating in ""Pioggia Viola,"" a processed recording of some band's live show, complete with crowd noise. As a dramatic chord progression unfurls, software plug-ins push sound past clipping, a drug trip gone both good and bad."
5,Entry Shelf well made,"Very well made. The quality is much better than shelves I have purchased from pottery barn and other major retailers. The only issue we had was the dowel, which covers the screw heads, is too big and required us to shave it off a bit to fit and touch up the paint."
4,Used in my kids bathroom,"I looked and looked for this shelf, and I finally found it. I wanted a pegged shelf for my kids bathroom. I thought the pegs would be easier for them to hang up towels on and.... they are. It looks great in the bathroom and the shelf allows of pictures, nick-nacks, extra storage. my only peeve is the paint is beginning to chip on the pegs, but I don't think you'd notice if you weren't looking for it."
4,White Entry Shelf,"I really like the look and sturdiness of the shelf. Just like the other person that left feed back, I also had problems with the little button dowels that hide the screw heads as the holes were not big enough to fit them. However instead of trying to fix the dowels like the other buyer, I opted to drill the hole out a little larger so the little dowel cover would fit in the hole. This way I didnt have to repaint and it was quick and easy. It does seem after a month of use that the paint is wearing off of the pegs where you hang your coats and may need repainting. All in all it is a good purchase that I am still happy with for the money."
4,first computer game for my 4 year old,This was the first computer game for my 4 year old. He learned it easily and can play with very little assistance. I am looking for a sequal.
1,Disappointed 5 year old,My 5 yr. old son loves Bob the Builder. He got it for Xmas and he is soooo disappointed with it's lack of interesting and challenging games. And you don't get to build... Sorry I got it.
3,Buy for the 2-4 year olds,"I bought this for my son who turned 5 in April. He lost interest in most of the games, even on the hardest level. The entire game does not challenge him. It is a cute game, but for younger children."
3,Bob the Builder,"I bought this game for my 4-year-old's birthday as he just loves Bob the Builder and watches him every chance he gets. He thoroughly enjoys this game. I think it is perfect for a child his age or younger. My 7-year-old enjoys the game too, but loses interest much quicker than my 4-year-old."
1,SUCKS,This thing is horrible. I was so excited to charge my PSP but it diddnt even work. If i could i would give it a 0.
1,Review,When I received my package after a week the only thing that worked was the USB cable. I wouldn't buy again nor would I recommend any one else to buy this item.
1,What is this thing,"Purchased because the original charger wasn't working. It comes in the mail and... the pieces don't fit together. The home charger won't even realize it's plugged into an outlet unless it remains at JUST the right angle, and then how it's ever supposed to actually charge the PSP is a mystery because the USB charger, which apparently doubles as the PSP end of the other two chargers, won't go all the way into the charger base. The USB charger does, to its credit, actually fit into a USB port, which is about the best I can say about this product because it STILL won't charge my PSP.Do not buy. Do not consider. Just... don't."
1,"poor quality, choose another brand","First time we attempted to use this it failed. The prongs sunk into the unit and the unit fell apart. Waste of money. When the unit fell apart I looked at the parts and it is very poorly made, cheap, solders weak etc.find another brand. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it none."
1,Not worth the money,"I recently bought this charger because it seemed like a cool idea to have a charger that had differant uses...but it turns out it is just a POS.Every time that i use the charger i have to wiggle the plug that going into the PSP untill the light orange light comes on and then worry able whether it is going to stay on the whole time it is charging,have tryed this with my 1000 psp and the newer 3000 psp and it always the same thing."
2,Broken,"I read the reviews and didn't expect the car adapter to work for long, but I didn't expect it to fall apart as I was unboxing it (which it did).The cable is not the one pictured. I was expecting a neat retractable usb-to-psp power cable. The one I got, while functional, was not the retractable one pictured. It was just a plain old straight cable with a USB A head on one end and a USB Mini-B, PSP power, and PSP Go power head on the other end.I gave it two stars for being inexpensive and for not being completely useless (the USB power cable does work...)."
3,Broken items,"I ordered two of these items, and I am glad that I did because one of them was broken. It would be one thing if the item got broken while it was being shipped, but this was not the case. The outer box was fine, someone packaged a broken item and shipped it anyways. Other than that.... great device."
2,Fax does not work,"After having problems receiving faxes from certain fax machines, I just returned my HP to buy a Cannon Multipass."
4,Great multifunction device for small office,"We have three of these and just purchased a fourth. They are fast and work very well for medium-volume work (probably could handle more). All three currently running are in different offices and users roam from office to office and are able to print/scan/fax.The setup was a little clunky and hard to understand how to make work. We did have to get on the phone with tech support a couple times for the first printer, after we knew what we were doing they were much easier. Support was very knowledgeable.The drivers are the only other sticky point. They are a little difficult to reconfigure when the network configuration changes. And may require re-installation to make work after a change. But once they work, they work well."
1,Worst Machine Ever,"I sit next to this monstrosity at work. I see and hear the complaints daily. It pulls multiple pages while both printing AND faxing. We even sent it back to be fixed because of another issue, and it is still as difficult as ever.DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE"
1,"Great hardware, but the PC software is terrible","The hardware functionality is excellent for our small office; however, the Windows PC-Hosted software is awful! The ""scan to destination"" feature is only compatible with Acrobat 5, and will it only work from the profile under which it was installed. So, if you log in as ""bob"" and install Acrobat and the HP software, you will only be able to create pdfs while logged in as ""bob"". Acrobat disappears as an option under all other profiles. Judging by HP's forums, this is a well known problem; however, they haven't released new software since 9-17-2003. The media slot can only be accessed through HP's proprietary software; thererfore, it doesn't appear as a drive, and can't be shared over the network without installing the nasty HP software on every machine.If you just want a great fax/copier get this. If you'd actually like to use the other features in a networked environment, forget about it."
1,very disappointed,"I wash everything before use; what a wrinkled, shrunken mess! The color wasn't ""true"" either.Tadpoles Basics Gingham Rod Pocket Window Valance, Yellow"
3,This is just okay,"If you want a fuller looking valance like what is shown in the picture, you should buy two. I only purchased one, but did not go to buy another only because the color doesn't match my daughter's room like I would like. I put it up and will leave it until I find exactly what I am looking for - so it is good for the time being. Had it been more expensive, I would have returned it. I give 3 stars because I don't feel like the material is that great - but what should I have expected for the price? You get what you pay for and maybe if there were two hanging, it wouldn't look as cheap."
1,Bluchhh!,"I love a light clever read and I like to think I have a sense of humor. But standing in front of a mirror, grasping my bosom and shouting ""Mine are Spectacular"" would not make me ""collapse in giggles"" with tears streaming down my face as it did the 40 year old, well educated characters. I just was not able to find any of this force fed humor believable enough, or funny enough, to engage in. Exhausting over-use of contrived quips and predictable dialogue of predictable characters underestimated the sophistication of readership. Sorry Janice and Lynn, for a crappy review. But you're laughing all the way to the bank with the 24 bucks I paid for this literary junk food, which was clearly the only end goal here."
3,Chick Lit... Light & Frothy,"A fine and sexy romp with interesting women you find yourself rooting for.Charming and whacky characters with warming flaws who find a way into your heart.I liked the book and think it will stay with me, if not for too long, at least for a couple of months. I think this book is better than their debut. Here you find women with new challenges and it might inspire you to try new things or to hope for new and exciting changes."
5,"A ""laugh-out-loud"" book","This book is really a ""laugh-out-loud"" and, a quick read novel. It relates to real life and real situations in a ""easily read"" format. A joy to read and a ""hate-to-finish"" from beginning to end."
4,easy summer read,"I bought this simply because the title intrigued me. It was a really easy, enjoyable read although not great literature. But sometimes, we need to simply be entertained by a book without alot of thinking and this one does that. My only complaint is that there are far too many references that seem to be nothing but advertisements for every product under the sun."
2,ok for a quick read,Not great but not horrible either its alright if you are just looking for some fluff to read and take up some relax time.
4,"Good fun, light read, definitely a chick book","Having lived in NYC for 5 years, I found this book hilarious. It's hard to believe that people would actually pay for a sleep pod, but this is New York we are talking about. A fun, fast summer read!"
1,Terrible,"Really weak book. I actually though it was not legal to use the real life famous star names in imaginary situations as this book does and after reading it you would wish that it is true. The name-dropping was suppose to be fun and entertaining but is irritating and unconvincing. The main character is supposed to be beyond the ""wanna-be""s but the plot is so weak that it is completely inappropriate. Save your self time and money and if you want a fun light read go for Sophia Kinsella or somebody else. Anybody else."
4,highly enjoyable,"this was a great, enjoyable, fluid read- it was clever and fun- i enjoyed the plot, the characters and the quality of writing was great- (i can't stand poor writing- feel like it is a waste of my time- an insult to my intelligence etc) -but these women can write really well and i look forward to another collaboration between them- i wanted to finish it quickly- really good book all around!"
2,product placement at its best,Mine Are Spectacular is an OK book if you want to read about every product that can be endorsed under the sun. I really felt like I was reading an advertisement. Predictable plot line at best.
3,Mindless Entertainment,"Cute and funny! More entertaining than the previous ""Botox diaries."" Great beach read, but not a lot of substance."
1,Wasn't worth my time,The only way that this book could be entertaining at all is if you go into it expecting nothing. I was very disappointed in the writing. The style is cheesy and the storyline is shallow and lame. I had thought that this book was going to be a fun 'chick' book but the only 'chick' that would enjoy it lives in a barn.
3,accuracy,"well, i haven't read this book, but i've read the reviews of it, and for the sake of accuracy, i have to point out that despite what at least two reviewers recollect, the teri hatcher character on ""seinfeld"" doesn't say ""they're mine and they're spectacular."" what she says is, ""they're real. and they're spectacular."" which isn't the same thing."
1,Cross erasers for Cross Classic Pencil,This was not the item described and would not work in my pencil. A full credit was issued to me and company response was good.
3,Galaxina,"Not expecting much from these movies. Galaxina stars Dorothy Stratten and out of curiosity, which is the reason I bought this movie."
3,Make sure you're in the mood before starting to review.,"If you're in the right mood, and realize these are not Grade A Movies, then you'll enjoy remembering your Drive in Theatre days. Only thing is, this time you'll actually watch the movie!"
3,A different blu ray,"I bought this because it was cheap and it was oldies. Teh movies are not so great, actually they're pretty boring. But I love movies and I love watching everything in the history of cinema, from Georges Meli√©s to ""Sharktopus"". So if you like to watch movie as much as me, you'll probably have a fun time watching these two movies."
4,"Impressive sound for MP3s, where is digital in port?","My Audigy 3 card started getting a static sound so I decided to upgrade to the Audigy 4. The sound on MP3s was better than the Audigy 3. However, my Audigy 3 had more inputs like a digital in for my DVD player in my PC. I don't play movies on my PC much but I wonder why it didn't have that port? Maybe there is a higher end Audigy 4 that has more inputs..."
2,Not what I expected!,The perfume came in its original package. The product came to my house in three days. Fast service from the seller. The perfume was just average. I love the smell but it doesnt stay for longer period. I wouldnt recommend this product for summer use.
4,Brenda has such a wonderful voice that is full of emotion,Piano in the dark is such a sensual song that paints a brilliant image in the mind of the listener. Many of Brenda's other recordings are equally as seductive and anyone who likes a full rich voice will love this CD!
4,Great Music from Brenda Russell!,"I bought the IMPORT version because it has 12 tracks instead of the USA version - 10 tracks. The extra two tracks ""Gravity"" and ""In the Thick of It"" are both great. ""Gravity"" was one song that I thought should have been a hit from her ""Get Here"" album but only ""Piano In The Dark"" was a hit. And what a huge awesome hit it was, still the best song from her by far, in my opinion. My second favorite song is ""Le Restaurant"", a light jazzy love story in song. Brilliant."
4,A truly gifted and inspired singer/songwriter.,"Given the fact that she's undeniably one of the best singer/songwriters of our time, it's almost incredible that Brenda Russell is so underrated and overlooked by many. ""If Only For One Night"", ""Get Here"", ""So Good, So Right"", ""Le Restaurant"" and ""Stop Running Away"" are timeless musical masterpieces which will make you a fan of this incredibly talented lady. The only reason why I did NOT give this fine compilation a 5-star rating is because its producers failed to include even one song from her 1981 LP ""Love Life"" (incredibly)."
4,GOOD FOR STARTERS.....BUT NEED MORE!........,"The Greatest Hits CD does have the radio hit 'Piano In The Dark'and songs she's written that were made hits by other artists, ""Get Here""-Oleta Adams, ""If Only For One Night"",-Luther Vandross and""Dinner With Gerswin""-Donna Summer. A true Brenda fan [yours truly]would opt for the ULTIMATE COLLECTION. Brenda Rusell has putout many studio albums that never disappoint."
4,Spellbinding delivery,"from an underappreciated and underexposed talent. ""Piano In The Dark"" is nothing short of brilliant from both songwriting and performace perspectives. Plus, it's the long version of the song, not the radio edit. Worth it, and a great value."
5,Simply Beautiful...,"Russell should have become a huge star. Her songs simple yet beautiful constructs filled with grace, passion and genuine soul. Think of the hits others have had with cuts like ""Get Here"" (Oleta Adams), ""Dinner With Gershwin"" (Donna Summer) or her very first success, 1978's ""So Good, So Right"" (which Joe Cocker covered admirably on Sheffield Steel). Her originals are far more rewarding, her voice lithe and supple, the arrangements cultured and tasteful. Yep, that's her playing the keyboards as well! This collection is a great find for pop fiends and remains a recommended way to get into Russell's magic easily and effortlessly. Exceptional soul music from the eighties..."
5,LOOOOVE melissa joan hart!,"I saw this movie in middle school or something and had to get it when I got the chance. Haven't watched the other movie it came with but it came in good condition so hey! Drive me crazy is a good movie. <3 Also, if you like Britney Spears her song Drive me Crazy is in it 0=-)"
3,its okay,i didnt want the buffy movie i just wanted the movie drive me crazy but it is one of my all time favoite movies ever.
3,"Video converter is poor, it basically disables the function","The reason I bought this one is the functionality. So far, the radio works fine, mp3 quality is good, the games look fun. Battery life needs to improve. But the biggest disspointment comes with the video. The video converter provided is poor. I tried a couple of WMV files, none of them turned out nice."
3,"Charging the Clix battery ""requires"" XP SP1","Nice product, but beware. No mention is ever made that the Clix will *NOT* charge the battery without XP SP1 or SP2 running. USB power bricks and computers running any other OS will *NOT* charge the battery. I've tested the power output with an electrical meter on several computer USB ports and this issue is not related to the power output of the port. The product will ""connect"" but it will not charge."
4,good purchase,"I was referred this product by my good friend. Overall, I like this product, the only downfalls are: 1) a little difficult to use and 2) the battery life... in previously owned mp3 players, I get a beep or a warning whenever the battery is running low. However with this iriver, it just shuts off completely when battery is down.the radio function is excellent."
2,"Very nice, a bit small and died after a year","Got the 2GB Clix ($135) in Dec 2006 for my 14-year-old teen.The screen is very small and it is very easy to use.It is a nice MP3 and Video (avi) player and very cool with lots of features like Flash games, nice FM radio, Alarm clock etc.A few days after the 1-year warranty passed, it suddenly stopped showing up as a Flash drive when connected to a PC.The support person said he works for a third party service and that this problem is common...If this had happened a few days ago, I would have been able to send it for repair. Unfortunately, while trying to troubleshoot the problem, I formatted the device so all we can do with it now is listen to radio..."
5,Pleased,I bought this for a fourteen year old girl for Christmas. It is everything I though it would be and she is in love with it. It is easy to use and sounds great. I let her use URGE (I pay for a certain dollar amount as part of the gift) for downloading music and with Windows Media Player 11 it is so easy just drag and drop. I would buy this product again.
3,Good but bad support,This was a very good mp3 player. It is very unique and your frinds will be amazed. The only problem is that iRiver has very bad customer support. I tryed calling them and i weighted amost one hour then i gave up. Also i sent a email and i still haven't gotten a reply 3 days later. So just make sure not to break you iriver.
4,Love My Clix,"My wife loves her iRiver Clix. She says it's easy to use, it's cute, has good sound quality and has told all her friends to get one. I think her best friend got one for Christmas. Thanks for making my wife happy."
4,Overall Very Good,Has a great display. The sound quality is awesome especially after tweaking the equalizer. The only issue I've had is that it has locked up on three different occasions. Pushing the reset button with a paper clip gets it going again without any loss of data..not a big deal. I would recommend this MP3 player.
1,NICE LOOKING BUT .........,All i have to say is that this thing is terrible. My rich dad bought it for me afterwinning my basketball tournament and it froze came back and froze again. I returned it and got to 60GB video ipods in black and white instead.
1,"Great hardware, terrible software, nonexistant support","I tried to load a playlist from WMP and twice the transfer failed. On the third attempt the player locked up and was unrecoverable (even with the reset button).I tried to contact iriver america by phone, but I was on hold until I gave up. I sent an email and a week later received a return email telling me to fax all of the information I had already emailed and wait another 48 hours to be verified as eligible for support. I returned the unit for a refund, and I'm waiting to get my ipod nano.I really wanted to like this player. The sound is good, the usage is intuitive, but the software is buggy and support is non-existant."
3,"If you like podcasts or video, stay away.","The Clix has very nice deep sound and makes a wonderful music player. It integrates with Windows Media Player 11 like a charm and the music services from URGE, Yahoo Music, Napster, etc. make filling the device full of music a simple task. If you only want to listen to music and just really hate iPods for some reason, get this player, no question. I have also has a Sansa and this player is worth the extra cost. If you want to listen to podcasts on this device, you will be down right angry. Windows Media has no podcast feature, so you will need to get another program to get the podcasts and then you will need to add them to player, this is very annoying. Also, there is not software included for video converting, if you want watch video you will be sent to an open source project and there you will download some crummy software. So overall, sound quality is great, but the software is down right awful. If you want podcasts and video, so with a iPod."
1,No go,"After I purchased my first MP3 Player and watched it die within a week, I decided to purchase this player. I did not turn on. No go. DOA. After consulting the manual, I decided to call customer service. After waiting 15 minutes on the phone, I decided to pack it up and return it to Walmart. Very disappointing. If you read some of the other reviews, they are right about one thing--customer service is almost nonexistent."
1,Products and Customer Service are Horrible,My Iriver worked fine and then the battery life degraded horribly. Returned the unit. They sent another. REPEAT THIS PROCESS FIVE TIMES. I should be on their payroll as much time as I have spent on this. The customer service people do not keep there promises and send you one defective unit for another one. The one I just got back os defective. POOR QUALITY CONTROL. You may get lucky. But when your unit fails expect the custmer service cycle from Hades.
4,Please answer a question about this item!,"It seems I can't find out if you can actually play back the fm recordings on the player, as the 1gb version review states you have to connect it to your PC to get them, which is not good at all, If I record from the radio, I want to be able to play it back on the clix! Also is this really easy to download music? Can you download from itunes?? (I already have music and a video purchased through them, I would like to put on this)Thanks for any help!"
1,Nice design but it doesn't work,"I bought the iriver clix based on the nice design and innovative interface. However the software is riddled with problems. Downloading music from Real Rhapsody is a nightmare. The transfers are extremely slow and deleting playlists from the player doesn't work unless you reformat the whole player. The player freezes when trying to play some songs and you have to carry a paperclip around to reset it. I tried to update the firmware through iriver's support website but it crashes halfway through and says ""firmware file not valid"". I am returning this product and buying a Sansa or a creative Zen."
1,Piece of Junk,Don't buy this. It's a piece of JUNK. I had the player for about a 40 days and the flash memory is toast already. Player tells me 0 mgs free and 0 mgs available. Formatting didn't work. Resetting didn't work. I've tried everything I can think of. Unfortunately I can't send it back to Amazon and I've emailed iRiver with the problem and still haven't heard back. The only reason I gave it one star becuase 0 wasn't an option. Even if iRiver decides to honor their warrenty I would rather send it back for a refund and buy something else...unfortunately I'm now stuck with an expensive paperweight I no longer want.
1,DO NOT BUY IRIVER's JUNK,"This company has some nerve. They sell the products, then go absolutly dark on the customer service end. ....Earth to iriver, come in irver!!! anybody home????"
5,Great book I'm still lost in 17 years later,"This is a very inventive and engaging book. I was probably about 13 or so when I first read this (I'm 30 now) and part of me is STILL lost in it!I hadn't been to the Winchester Mystery House in real life when I read the book. But for years until I finally did go, people who had been there thought I'd been, too, just because I was so familiar with it from the book. This book took me there. If you're looking for a great young adult book that takes you to a whole different place, this is the one to read!"
3,A Good Read,This book has a really cool premise and was carried out fairly well but I felt the ending was unsatisfying. This is one of those books where the characters and the setting are much more interesting than the plot. Still I'd recommend it as a good weekend read. But try to find it in a used bookstore before you buy it here.
4,Vanishing Point,The book is very captivating and full of vivid images of people and places. A book that you will surely read for start to finish!
4,garent earnings,I thought the earnings were reasonably priced and the quality was nice for said price. It was a gift and it could have been packaged better than a little zip bag.
1,Misguided,"If you are a beginner Don't buy this Book. It DOES NOT COME WITH TAB as adverstised. Want a good one get ""The the best Christmas GUITAR Fake book ever"" IT DOES COME WITH TAB!.."
1,No Tab!,The description of this book is 100% incorrect and misleading. It does not contain any guitar tab as indicated.
3,OK,"This watch was exactly what i was looking for when i saw it. However when i recieved it the colour of the band of the watch is not what i expected. The band looks like a beautiful copper tone, what i got was almost mauve(purpleish) in colour."
5,love this watch,"I love this watch. I have had it since November 2009 and although it is a little scratched up it still looks great. The color has not changed and it works well. My problem has been the goldtone comes off either on top or underneath. My skin is very acidic and the tone just disappears very quickly. I wear it everywhere, even doing my dishes. The only time I take it off is to shower, swim and sleep. Very, very happy with the quality and the look."
5,Kenneth Cole Reaction Watch,"I absolutely LOVE this watch. Its easy to read, very well made, and was easy to adjust the band and at a great price. I love the coppery brown color of it too. Its gorgeous!!"
5,The equivalent of Buddhism 101,"Offers bite-sized (2-3 pages) discussions on many of the elements of Buddhism. Structured around the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. An excellent starter, with good line drawing illustrations. Clear and straightforward."
1,"When looking for classic hits, medleys just don't cut it!","The on-line description of this box set does not let the customer know that the majority of the classic hits from the sixties and seventies are performed in medleys. The medleys suck and destroy the power and feeling of the original recordings that made them chart toppers. I wasted my money on this one and if it weren't for Amazon's return policy, I would've sent it back! Word of warning!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!"
5,"SAW LOU LIVE-LOVE TO LISTEN TO LOU ""LIVE""","I HAD HEARD THE ALBUM MANY YEARS AGO AND REALLY LIKED IT. MY WIFE AND I WENT TO ONE OF HIS CONCERTS AND WE BOTH WANTED TO GET THIS CD. IT'S GREAT. IT REMINDS US OF THE THE CONCERT. WE ENJOY THE SONGS YOU DON'T NORMALLY GET TO HEAR HIM SING PLUS SOME OF THE OLDER STUFF (I'LL BUY ONE OF HIS ""BEST OF"" TO HEAR ALL OF THE OLDER HITS). MY WIFE AND I VOTE THIS CD A ""5""."
2,Snapped first time out,First time out with this umbrella was a blustery day in New York City. Gusts up to 35 MPH. Umbrella busted almost instantly. Definitely feel like the construction of this umbrella wasn't what it was cracked up to be.
1,Loved it Until it broke shortly after buying,"Had this product only a few months. Needed an umbrella one rainy day, pulled it out of my car and it's no longer working. For the money spent I would have thought this to be a sturdier product. Disappointed."
2,waste of money,"It's heavy, the button mechanism is hard to push, and retracting the thing is a pain. Much simpler models perform better."
3,"Keeps you dry, poor construction","I received this umbrella as a gift for Christmas and 4 months later, it broke. The product description says it will withstand gusts of up to 60 mph, but based on my experience, that is quite a stretch. It was a moderately windy morning in the Midwest, and as I rounded a corner while I was walking to work, a giant gust of wind flipped my umbrella inside out & instantly broke 2 of the spokes right at the plastic joint. I was really disappointed because this umbrella really keeps you dry and is in a convenience compact size. I really like this brand, so I will stick with this brand, but likely go for the GustBuster one specifically and see if my luck is any better."
2,Small Umbrella,The umbrella was too small to cover me enough in windy New York rain. I ended up making my first return to amazon.com with this umbrella.
2,"Smaller than I had thought, does not auto-close","Item seems well made. Even though it is build as auto-open-auto shut, the shut is manual on the item I received. Advertised as 43 inches, this is measured across the top arc of the umbrella. At the widest point, the diameter is 36 inches....which for myself is too small."
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"I BOUGHT IT AS A MEN'S UMBRELLA,BUT REALLY IS A SMALL AND HEAVY UMBRELLA I DID'NT LIKE IT,I WOULD'NT BUY ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS."
5,Excellent!,Highly recommended! It is as described. My boyfriend loved it since he will be going to London this summer. For sure it will hold the rain along with the wind!
4,Very sturdy umbrella,Sturdy and easy to hold. A bit smaller and heavier than I expected. Auto-open mechanism works well. Glad I bought it.
1,Damaged product,"I received the umbrella and it was damaged. I didn't realize until I tried to use it the hardware underneath was bent, twisted causing the umbrella to leak. I returned the item"
4,Leighton Windefyer Automatic Umbrella,I ordered this umbrella and when it did not arrived on the scheduled delivery day I contacted the company to find out that they had lost track of my order despite the fact that it said it had been shipped so they had to send me another one. I have not gotten a chance to use the umbrella yet but it looks a lot sturdier than my last one so hopefully it will not break in the wind.
4,good for wind,"I wanted an umbrella that would hold against the wind and this one is definitely good for that. So I'm really happy with it. The only things I don't like as much are the short handle and the fact that it's a little hard to close it...and you have to make sure that's really closed, otherwise it opens up and can actually hurt you a little:)"
5,Nothing like this anywhere!,"The brilliant lectures of RS Rushdoony on an overview of the history of the world.Seeing the progress of the Gospel, with fair and balanced treatment of the influence of the disapora, Monks, various monarchs, and the motive behind exploration of the new world, Rushdoony skillfully takes aparts the myths so commonly repeated (I can't even say 'taught"") in the government schools.The ONLY problem with this set is that is ends...."
3,There are better options,"There's nothing really special about this box. It has a tray in the lid and a lift out tray. Half of the compartments are not usable. They're too deep and narrow. They diIt is large enough to hold all your black powder supplies for a day at the range. I'm just disappointed that this is such a generic box. I bought it because of reviews I saw on another site. Also black is a bad color, it keeps you from seeing any spilt powder. I didn't think of that until I had already taken delivery. You can get this box in fluorescent orange here.MTM Sportsmen's Plus Utility Dry BoxWill I keep this? Yes, would I have bought it if I had seen it in a store? No.The comments made by others about MTM ""dry"" boxes apply to this one.I'd recommend looking at small tool boxes at one of the big box stores. Most have trays that are more usable.Stanley 016011R Series 2000 16-Inch Tool Box"
3,I should pay more attention to descriptions...,"I adored the look of this pendant...when looking at the pictures. Even though I read the descriptions and knew how big this was...I bought it anyway. Shame on me. Its rather unwieldy in its design and is heavier than I wanted it to be. Although it looks nice over all, I certainly wish now that it was a bit smaller or lighter. I still wear it of course, but I certainly will pay more heed next time I'm told something is this large."
3,Not as good as Original Equipment,"These connectors work fine, but they are a thinner grade of plastic compared to Original Equipment. The OE connectors are a heavy grade plastic, these connectors are light and flimsy. They hold antifreeze, but I don't think they will last the same amount of years as the original equipment. Next time, I will spend the extra couple bucks and get Original Equipment from the Dealer."
4,"Not as great as ITTY, but that's a different subject.","Her voice is absolutely amazing! It really stands out in the acoustic track. Though it's not like her last, EXCELLENT single, ""I Turn to You"" (which I would highly recomend for the fast music pace goers), ""If That Were Me"" is a slow paced song where you can appreciate the lyrics. Mel C will also donate all proceeds of this single to a charity for the homeless. Good song for a good purpose... which makes this CD a well worth purchase!"
5,Charity,"Melanie C has had major sucess with all of her singles from the album Northern Star so it is to suprise that Mel has decided to give the procedds from her latest single to charity. All of the proceeds from the single ""If That Were Me"" are being donated to a homeless charity. That reason alone wouldn't make you buy the cd but the fact that it is good would. The latest single is a slow ballad which is a good way to finish of the album having explored ever other musical aspect. Well done Mel lets hope that other people will follow your lead and start donating more to charity"
3,KJV Apocryphal Bible,"A very well-bound volume but the print is in need of better ink to paper technology. It is a shame to spend that much money on a Bible and the print be so weak. Still, where else are you going to get this traditional Bible with an enduring cover? The concordance print is almost non-existent on many pages. I still treasure my copy of it,but Cambridge needs to do something regarding the weak printing on many pages."
3,Excellent...though it has some manufacturing flaws,In that it is one of the only KJV's available with the Apocrypha included I must say that it is a great find. My only reservation would be that the one copy I purchased had some loose pages in it (I didn't buy it from Amazon BTW). I returned the copy I purchased. I may end up buying another one and hope that it is free from manufacturing defects. The only other version of the KJV with the Apocrypha in print that I know of is the Oxford classics edition. It's a kind of cheezy looking paperback however. It's too bad there isn't a middle of the road edition available.
5,Love's Unending Legacy,"Great, wholesome movie.The whole family can enjoy this, as well as the other sequels."
4,A Solid Legacy,"This is the first one of these I've seen in the series. And I'm certainly not a Christian fiction reader, but I am a film buff and a couple we are friends with turned me on to this series. I gotta say, I came away very moved. Plenty to pick on to be sure, but dang it, that adoption scene in the church was a tearjerker. And, I kind of like films that are predictable and romantic especially when my wife is getting all caught up in it if you know what I mean. I want to go back and check out the one with the Grey's Anatomy actress, though how she got from Christian fiction to Knocked Up I'd rather not speculate. Anyway, certainly worth watching, and if you like these pioneer sagas, worth buying."
5,Great DVD,This is a great movie. Now I have the whole collection. I watch it over and over and enjoy the books more.
5,Blues gal,"LOVE this series. I watch them all the time, as a pick-me-upper. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the DVD set either. Anyone looking for a down to earth story, watch this series."
5,A Very Good Family Film,The is one of the best of Janette Oke's Love series. A very good movie and suitable for the whole family.
4,Solid,"This is a great movie.Let's be honest, Heigl set the bar pretty high but this carries through the timeless message.My wife bought it last week and we watched it as a family this weekend.Again, solid family-friendly entertainment. My wife is more of the ""Janette Fan"" but nevertheless, she got us hooked on these."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have never read the books,so I can't say how they hold up to them,but the movie series was great until this one came along. As other reviewers have pointed out,WHY did they have to make Willie die!?! Its like they're trying to repeat the first installment,Love comes sofly,all over again and doing a sorry job at it.They killed off one of the best and most enjoyable actors which left me rather annoyed.Also what happened to some of the characters,Marty and Clark's kids and Jeff and the ranch hands? No explaination is given about them. That said, it still has some good points, Dale Midkiff has returned in his role as Clark and Christian morals play a big part in the film."
3,Love's Unending Legacy,I really loved this series of books when I read them. I have enjoyed the movies also. The early movies stayed quite close to the books. This latest movie however really went away from the books. In that way I was a little bit disappointed. To look at it on its own however it was quite beautifully done.
2,What happened?,"This series was great, good, great, great, and then WHAT HAPPENED! This movie was pointless. Someone must have run out of ideas. This movie had nothing to do with anything. It had a language spot too. Sad ending to a line of good clean movies."
1,What a butcher job,I hate what Michael Landon Jr. has done to Janette Oke's writting's. Her books are awsome. It's to bad he didnt follow her story line closer because he really could have gone on farther than Love's Unending Legacy.The first three movies were ok as movies. But for someone who has read Janette Oke's book's......it's just a shame what he did.
2,video,"I bought this movie for someone for Christmas--after purchasing and having it sent, I found it could have been purchased at a local store for about 6 bucks cheaper!!"
5,Love's Uneding Legacy,A great movie. The whole family enjoyed it. We have all the previous DVDs and we could not wait to see what happens next to Missy and her family.Sure recommend this one.
1,If you liked the first ones...,"...Don't get this one. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. (which is saying something as I love 70's horror movies too) The prior movies start out excellent and decline to this gem.How bad is it? We had to turn it off because our wisecracking was waking up the kids. the plot is weak, the acting is weak, and the movie is not worth watching. I donated it to the library to spare as many from purchasing it as possible.sad...very sad"
1,HORRIBLE!!,"This movie is so far off from the book, it is infuriating. To think that they killed off Missie's husband Willie for theatrics and so she could have a new love interest is horrible. Also, what happened to all of Missie's brothers, and her other children? In the books, her and Willie stayed at the ranch and raised a very lovely family and prospered on their ranch. Now, all of the sudden, all of that is gone. Also, Belinda is Marty and Clark's daughter, who was a late surprise, not an adopted daughter of Missie's. I couldn't even finish the movie, I was so upset. DON'T WATCH!!!"
5,Powder my butt,It arrived on time and was just as advertised. Why shop locally when this is so easy? We are blessed.
2,Works great - but now concerned about harmful particles,I'm not usually paranoid but I was very surprised to find out how many health professionals I spoke with were adamant against using talc based powders. The fine particles go deep into the lungs of you and the child. I'm not sure I am 100% that it's similar to asbestos in possible harm but it's enough to make me throw it away and go back to messy creams. I've heard that corn starch is better as the granules are larger.
5,Caldesene Products Are Elite,"Caldesene products never fail me! I use this for just about everything, from hot humid days of cycling to long hikes through the swampslands. After being waterlogged and feeling icky for a good part of the day, a nice hot shower and some medicated powder brings my skin back to life. When my son was a baby, I never had a reason to bother with rash creams as long as Caldesene was around. There isn't much else to say about this except that it works!"
5,Best feminine powder!,This is the best powder on the market to keep females (babies to adult women) fresh & dry all day long!!
3,"Excellent, brilliant- one flaw","Its silent, the water flow is better than any powerheads I have seen. This was my third powerhead in a week, very calm. Biggest flaw is only one rubber stick is holding it to the tank compared to more than twoon any other powerheads, so you may find it swimming with your fishes sometime. Nonetheless great powerhead at an awesome price.Keeps falling off, makes good amount of noise now. Won't recommend."
5,Great water flow and longevity,"I've used this pump now for about a year and it still works perfectly. Water circulation is outstanding. Only gripe I would have is that they need to be primed after every water change. For some reason, they hold the air inside the pump preventing water from flowing. Simple remedy is to just turn the unit upside down in the water for a few seconds to let the air out, once the water starts flowing again, just reinsert it back into the filter tube. Works perfect after that."
5,perfect,I love the use of a power head in an aquarium to move water. It works great and adjusts with ease.
3,Clear images day and night -- with just one flaw,"I purchased this unit from Target on clearance about 2 weeks ago for $50 and it was well worth even double the price. The image is stable and clear, even in night-vision mode. Sound is quite good too, picking up even very faint sounds. (This might be a problem in a noisy setting.) The only downside, so far, is an loud annoying ""click"" that sounded every few seconds the first time we used the monitor. Switching from channel A to channel B seems to have resolved this problem, which may have arisen from another signal source within our home (phone, wireless router, etc.)"
1,Disappointed,"This game came stamped ""not for resale"" and it doesn't work on our Playstation, so I cannot resell the item to Hastings or the pawn shops. Now I am stuck with a scratched up game that was titled ""like new."""
1,Had to return - wouldn't work,"The game wouldn't work in my grandson's playstation - returned it - found it at a local store - it wouldn't work either. However, Offroad Fury I,II,III will work. Don't know what the problem is."
3,Grandson's Gift,Did not play this game but was on the top of our grandsons list for Christmas. It was a great transaction. Very speedy. Thank you.
1,It didn't work,"The game was actually a gift for my husband's 10 year old son. When he received it, it did not work. We have returned it to hopefully receive a working game."
4,David has a wide range of talent,"After recently seeing the new New York Dolls at the House of Blues, I found this little gem in a pile of on sale CDs at the mall. David is certainly one of the most underrated talents in the music business. First of all, the concert was amazing. All the musicians gave it their all despite the fact that is was not a sell out or even close to it. David deserves more recognition than he gets and I hope someday it opens up for him in a big way. Sweet Revenge was is an '80s attempt at the Disco-New Wave sound. The best song on the score is ""The Filthy Rich"" with ""Sweet Revenge"" as second. David proves he can adapt without selling out. A fine talented man whose career I have followed since his early days in New York during the ""70s. I wish him more success than he gets....... and someday he will have it."
3,"the soundtrack to the 80s--but they screwed up the 12"" mixes","Landing pretty much smack dab in the middle of the 80s, this album epitomizes everything we loved about this synth-drenched era. Kind of new wave, kind of arena rock, very camp, and much better than Johansen's REAL sell out..Hot Hot Hot. My only huge disappointment with this near perfect release is that, while the album tracks sound crystal clear, all 3 12"" mixes are totally muffled. I don't know if they had bad master tapes or if they simply mastered them from vinyl and figured 'clouding' the sound quality would hide any defects in the records they used. What a shame."
2,Disappointing coverage of topics,"Thought this book would be perfect A-Z reference for my home-networking needs, but alas, coverage of key topics was disappointing. Details and comparisons of networking protocols was scant. A common file sharing error, which i frequently experience was not covered at all (Windows File Error: 1026). Also this book recommends Norton AntiVirus, one of the most disappointing and buggy AV applications i have tried.I found ""Sams Teach Yourself Windows Networking in 24 Hours"" to be much more informative for my needs (at a lower price)."
5,Can't get by without it,David Strom's Home Networking book is a must have. If you read it you'll get a good tutorial on how things work. If you have things that don't work you can use it as a troubleshooting guide. It is very comprehensive -- includes both PC and the Mac and numerious networking vendors. I recommend the book for anyone who wants or needs to know more about how to share computers and printers and files in their home.
4,Young Lust re-released,"Yes, folks, this is an exact re-release of Young Lust. That one was released only 5 years before this and was remastered, so the sound quality is the same. The reason that only the Geffen stuff is on here is that Young Lust was put out by Geffen. If you have that, skip this. If you don't have that, buy this! This makes a great companion to Pandora's Box, as that set is a 3-CD box covering only their original Columbia years."
1,"Hey, Wait a Minute...","Fans of Aeromsmith may notice that the track listing on this album looks conspicuously like that of a greatest hits collection, ""Young Lust: The Aerosmith Anthology,"" released less than four years ago and now conveniently unavailable at a discounted price. Perhaps unaware that the lack of sales in the previously collection was most likely related to the release of yet another Aerosmith greatest hits album in 2002 by Columbia, Geffen Records has slapped a new cover and title on the 2001 anthology and rereleased it, presumably hoping to sucker a few fans into buying a new copy. Fortunately, it appears to be near the bottom of Amazon's CD sales rankings as of this review (I only came across it because Amazon's algorithms put it on the home page for me), and that is precisely where it should stay.Oh, the actual musical content warrants four stars, by the way. But who really cares at this point?"
4,Oldies but Goodies,"My husband and I really like Steven Tyler on American Idol, and wanted to remember his old songs. We'll listen on our way to Reno, and sing!"
4,Aerosmith - Gold,I recieved this product on time and in great condition for a used CD. I would recomend this company to others.
3,Disappointing.,"I bought this expecting a decent Greatest Hits-type collection. With Aerosmith lately cranking out at least two ""Best Ofs"" per year (and they started back as early as 1980 with Best of Aerosmith!) I now wish I had purchased ""O Yeah! The Greatest Hits"" because ""Gold"" (released through Geffen) is pretty much just a bunch of their recent popular stuff, with a few older songs but none of the truly great ones. The fact that ""Walk This Way"" is not included in its original form, but with the more popular mainstream Run-DMC remix, is suiting.What maddens me the most is that Aerosmith (or their labels) are really milking fans now - I mean, O Yeah is released, then this, and we have yet to even see a new album in between.I'm not saying this is a totally worthless CD; it isn't. It has some good songs. But really, it's good for fans - if I were new to Aerosmith, I don't think this collection would really grab my interest or turn me on to their music."
5,Do computers just run programs?,"Computing the way it was and the way they saw it would be in the future. Add to this a mystery that may rival Stephen King fans.Avery Jensen (Dean Stockwell) is discussing how all the computers in town are linked together. Some rambunctious students see this as and advantage to getting a credit card. So they get fellow student, Karen McMillan (Stefanie Powers) and a young cutie to vamp Avery into making a man on paper. Everything is going swimmingly until the paper man purchase a gun and grows an unnecessary birth certificate. Now it looks as though the computer has a mind of its own and the creators are meeting with a mysterious demise. It also seems mysterious that Avery seems immune.It is interesting to see the actors as they were in this movie the Lisa (Tina Chen) that teaches the computer to say breath (death) is in the movie ""Three Days of the Condor"".Three Days of the Condor"
4,"Good quality, slots too big","Like the other reviews, this is a good product as expected from OXO. Sturdy plastic and comfortable to use.This isn't always good for pasta though, they make it through the cracks."
5,Great product with a Great price,I love OXO products and use this colander almost on a daily basis. OXO products are quality products and I purchase this brand whenever possible.
1,A waste of money!,"The book contains a highly distorted account of the history of the region. Unfortunately, to those unfamiliar with the subject, it may look like a scholarly work. Also, the author's profound anti-Arab sentiments are clear throughout the book. What a waste of money!"
1,WHAT A TRASH.....SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This Jewish author knows nothing about Syria's history. In fact after looking into his other works and watching this Jewish propogandist on Televesion, I concluded that you will be better off talking politic with your dog. This way,you will have a more objective assesment of facts."
1,Not to be trusted,"Daniel Pipes, the head of Campus Watch, is not an author to be trusted on any topics related to the Middle East. Because of the author's extreme anti-Arab, pro-Zionist stand, this book is further proof that Syria is greatly misunderstood in the West. This book is only worth reading to understand some of the neo-con illusions on the region."
5,A wonderful treatise,"This wonderful study of modern syrian politics unmasks the ambitions of Syrias leadership from King Faisal to Hafiz Asad and beyond. An eminent study by an eminent scholar, a must read for anyone interested in Syria, Ba'athism and the like."
1,Hanging on a Straw,"Daniel Pipes aspiration for academic legitimacy is hardly helped by this book. Pipes is not an `Orientalist' in the common sense. He does not view Syria, for example, from the point of view of Cromer and Balfour and their latter day cultists. He does so, from the point of view of the Paul Johnson's of the world. Those who attempt through unabashed distortions (the overwhelming number is truly overwhelming) and short-changing the reader (by half truths already debunked by a number of Israeli historians), to relive the golden age of conquest, of colonialism.The world today is, thankfully, different. Pipes' singing in the academic colonnade sounds more like a visiting swan than a piece of objective delivery of research results."
1,Waste of Money,"I paid far more for this book than I could ever save by using it. Most of the ""offers"" are for free coupons, free newsletters and free contests - if you give up your address/email address/phone number for future spam offers. Sites are even listed that you can ""check for promotions."" Most of the actual free samples offered are expired or the links go nowhere. Very disappointing. Save your money."
1,Don't waste your money,Most of the offers in this book don't exist anymore as well as several of the websites. You can find better freebies yourself by simply going to the websites of the items you need most and looking at their deals. Please don't waste your money on this book! It is NOT worth it!
5,Best-Ever,This is my all time favorite album... and I never get tired of listening to it. Musical expression and delivery can't get any better than 'Hole in the Bucket'. It is always such a delight to listen to meaningful lyrics and a soulful sound... anytime.
4,As Hearty as a Plate of Red Beans and Rice,"How to find enough praise for Michael Franti & Spearhead's ""Home."" It was one of the finest albums of current American music on its release and it remains so. Starting right with ""People in the middle"" - Franti shows an ability to use his words to create visual images and palpable emotions. His clear, strong voice embraces a myriad of styles and his message - a mixture of social commentary and humor - means his intent is never in doubt.As terrific as ""Home"" is, it is but a foreshadowing of some of the work Michael would bring to us in later efforts. It is, a fantastic introduction to the work of one of America's greatest current artists - and one of the world's most beautiful people."
5,Plain Ol' Christmas Songs,"For those of you tired of ""Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire"" for the 19th time in a row, these are plain, normal Christmas songs without any extras added on to them. I personally hate it when modern artists butcher traditional Christmas songs. Here there are lots of rare ones that usually never get played on the Christmas stations. It's refreshing to hear some ""new"" old songs that have almost been forgotten. Some are played on piano, some on organ, and some have the choir singing along. A few feature solos. If you like this album, you'll love the other two in the same series."
4,A Captivating Read,"This debut novel is a definite page turner from beginning to end. It tells the story of Cameron Spears and his account of domestic abuse amongst his parents, and how he grows to hate his father because of it. His character displays a strong voice that draws the reader's into his life story. He is also a teenager going through adolescence and facing teen relationship issues, yet trying to remain focused in his education studies while trying to ""not be like his father"". I would recommend all teens to read as it displays positive insight on issues such as premarital sex, peer pressure, respect for your parents, and many other juvenile related issues. But I strongly encourage parents/adults to read this book because it shows what we as women tolerate some things sometimes for too long and how our children can pick up the negative behavior they become subjected to. I believe J.L. Woodson speaks very clearly in this novel, and he is truly an excellent writer."
1,Boring Tedious Video,After starting salsa classes I thought I would get a video to use at home to supplement my classes but this video is awful! There is a couple who are dancing together and they show you each person's steps while they are dancing. It's very boring and their voices just drone. I am a beginner so this video is not too slow but after one run through I will never use it again. I'll probably just give it to the goodwill. I would not recommend this video to anyone.
3,Ehhhhh. Maybe.,"If you are looking for a primer in Salsa that is cheap, go for it. However, you'd probably receive more interesting instruction elsewhere. This DVD struck me as flat, unemotive, and sterile.The instruction is indeed precise, but salsa is a very emotional and seductive dance. This DVD presents it as more of a surgical procedure :D"
4,"Very Complete, but.....","I have used this publication for several weeks now. It is very complete in all aspects. My only complaint is that with Kindle, it's not easy to navigate when in a classroom environment, where one has to go from scripture to scripture. It can be done, but not sufficiently fast enough to stay with the class as far as my talents go. I have another scripture program on my iPod touch,and the navigation there is much easier. If Kindle ever gets to a touch screen, and the program is modified for that, then obviously the the navigation will work well.For general reading where navigation isn't an issue, I like my Kindle very much. I find I'm doing much more reading, able to have 2 or 3 book going at the same time."
4,"Great Content, But Expensive","The content is wonderful. The scriptures are fully linked with footnotes, etc. It took a very long time to index. I decided it wouldn't index and contacted amazon for a refund. Before the refund came through, it finally indexed successfully. It's a great kindle book, but I think it's priced a little high. $19.99 would be more reasonable for what you get."
5,Can you imagine how long it takes to brush your teeth when you're a crocodile?,"Poor Clarabella! While her friends are playing, eating,and having fun, she's STILL brushing her crocodile teeth!The young children I teach really get into this story. Whenever Clarabella brushes her teeth, I have the kids pretend to brush their teeth as I sing or chant, ""She's brushing, and brushing, and brushing, and brushing, and brushing her crocodile teeth!""Surprise! - Clarabella's resourceful friends present her with an extra-long toothbrush so she can brush her teeth more quickly and have time to play with them!The language is simple, and the illustrations are absolutely adorable. There aren't too many really fun books for young children about toothbrushing! This one is excellent!"
2,A little boring,"My daughter (19 months) hasn't shown much interest in this book. She doesn't usually sit still through the entire reading, but she does for other books (so I know she can)."
4,Super cute!,"What an adorable tale! Clarabella is a young crocodile who misses snack, playtime, and fun because she has to spend so much time brushing her mouthful of teeth. Her friends rescue her from her dilemma, though. Perfect for toddlers and preschoolers just learning about sharing, and playing with others."
4,Does the job,"The tamper works alright. It could be SLIGHTLY larger, as I have lots of pulp come up around the tamper - so it takes longer to juice, but it seems to be the right length. It is VERY lightweight, certainly a big change from the solid wood tamper I grew up using... I was nervous that it might crack with heavy use, but seems to be holding up just fine."
2,Gave up after page 94,"As in my other reviews, I have always found Jane Feather an auto buy and purchased this after being quite pleased with Almost a Bride. But as most the other reviews state, I have to agree this is a sleeper and a dud. I usually can't put her books down but this one I kept down and up for 3 days and still only got to page 94 before finally giving up and tossing it in my give away pile. I just have too many other books to read without spending days trying to find out why I just can't get into this one."
3,not quite...,"While this book was an OK read, there are way too many unanswered questions. Who is Cosimo? What's his story? All unknown. The author never really gave me a reason to bond with the hero. Also, I had a bit of trouble believing that the heroine would forgive the hero his deceptions so seemingly easily. The ending was odd, as well. Not quite..."
2,Disappointed reader,"I have read near every book Jane Feather has written and was looking forward to the release of this book. I was very disappointed. Neither the hero nor the heroine were appealing and too many questions remained unanswered. Who was Cosimo? How did Meg give up her cosseted life so easily?I still would recommend Ms. Feather's ""V"" book series (Vixen, Valentine, etc.), but skip this one."
1,Hard to finish book,"I am a long time fan of Jane Feather. I have even gone out of my way to hunt down and purchase books by her that are out of print. I bought this title with joyful anticipation of another great read, but what a let-down! I couldn't find anything redeeming in either the slutty leading lady nor the sociopath leading man. It was an absolute struggle to get through the ending of the book - I put it down and came back to it a dozen times before I could choke it down. The parrot, Gus, was the most interesting and sympathetic character. Pity he couldn't find a nice female bird."
4,Truly Enjoyable!,"Almost a Lady is a spirited tale of adventure, intrigue, lust and love on the high seas. Jane Feather captures the escapades and caprices of a handsome, mysterious privateer, a lady of the English nobility, and Napolean. A quick, fun read!"
1,Hit or miss,"Jane Feather novels are either hit or miss with me. This was a definite ""miss"". I couldn't finish it."
5,"Very well researched, historical book. A must for musicians!","Hello,Finally, I have read this massive and very well documented volume. This book is an absolute must for Rachmaninov and/or classical fans. Rachmaninov's view on where music is going mirrors my own. The holy grail of this book rests in the many (translated) letters from Rachmaninov to his entourage and friends. I found them very insightful, and it validated my guess that composers write a ""story"" for inspiration before writing musical notes. Of course, Rachmaninov, being a musical genius, can write ""stories"" better than any of us, but this was particularly insightful. I was shocked when Rachmaninov wrote that his Op32 Preludes were 'tedious exercises to compose'; I love his Preludes, and I think he only wrote that because compared to his piano concertos and symphonies--they are comparatively small works indeed.Anyway, if you are a fan of the master, you must buy this chef-d'oeuvre!√Ä la prochaine,Charles Henri Darakdjian"
3,Practice amp for home.,"This is a nice little amp that is good for home practice only. I wouldn't bring it to my jam sessions as I just don't think it has the umph or the features to support playing against anything other than another Bad Dog. However, that being said, I am glad I bought it as it is a great size and the sound quality is good."
5,This CD is great!!,This group is super good. All the songs are written with a great message in them. The Cd is a high quility CD. I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,Review,Replaced identical printer. Works just as good. No problems with this item. Had a miscommunication with vendor but they solved the problem and solve the problem above expectations.
1,Bad printer,"I received a printer from these guys and it was dirty and did not work. They offered to replace with a ""hand picked"" unit from their warehouse. The second printer was dirtier than the first and it had stains on the case. It did not work either. I have uninstalled and reinstalled printer drivers on 3 different computers in our office in an attempt to get this printer to work and have had no luck. As far as I am concerned, these guys sell junk. Be very careful if you do business with them."
2,poor quality type,"I'm not sure what other people use their printer for, but I need top quality-looking manuscripts. I had a 4L for ten years and it gave better quality. The problem is that it prints too light. Otherwise, its a nice machine. But I'm returning mine.good luck."
1,TERRIBLE TEXT QUALITY,Don't waste your time with this printer. Do your research before hand! The text quality on this device is below standard with terrible bleeding and smudgy lines ! My old Laserjet 6l produced far superior results ...Check out other users experiences in Usenet as well as CNET's review where they pointed out the very poor text quality ... HP should be ashamed :-(
2,Good while it lasted...about 2 years,"I came online just to check prices for this printer, since mine just flamed out and I wanted to see how much I'd originally spent on it. I was startled to see other reviews detailing *exactly* what happened to my 1300... steaming along just fine until about year 2, then paper jams, crackling noises, shredded rollers and the works.The printer worked like a champ for as long as it lasted, but once the crackling sound hits, as mentioned in another review, it's time for a new printer."
1,Prints Crooked,"I've purchased and returned three laserjet 1300's due to crooked print. The text rises about 1/8"" from left to right. This is not acceptable. Unless I purchased three lemons, I'd recommend not purchasing this product."
2,Fuser film sleeve problems within a couple of years,"I administer around 40 1300n printers and most of them are doing okay after 15 months worth of use but I have noticed several starting to have problems with the fuser film sleeve coming apart inside. At first you start hearing a noise as the sleeve revolves around with the part that is flaking off making noise with every spin. And from what I understand, this is not something very easy to replace by yourself."
1,Serious problems after less than 2 years,"This printer prints quickly and efficently, it was easy on toner and was used by one person printing less than 15 sheets per day. The down side is that it is less than 18 months old and the roller is shot, the teflon is gone on one side and it distroys anything I try to print. The cost to repair it is estimate to be $300 which is about a wash for a new printer. I guess it would have paid to get the extended warranty. Although new printers should last more than 18 months."
1,Awful,"Our HP Laserjet 1300 lasted two years with very light use. Then the fuser film sleeve ripped. This $30 part cannot be replaced by the average user. I tried, but ended up throwing the whole thing in the garbage.It worked fine during it's short expensive life.Just don't expect to have it for long."
1,Its not our Fathers Hewlett Packard,"I had a HP laser I bought new in 1992 that lasted 13 years under home use. I bought a 1300n and it has lasted 18 months under very moderate home use. I turned it on one day and CLACK CLACK CLACK , very loud. Sounds like the problem described elsewhere. Service cost is ridiculous. I would expect better from HP. In anycase, I am not happy, and won't buy another HP."
3,Pretty Good For The Home Office User,I've had this printer for about a year and have been pleased with it. It's a good little printer that rarely jams or causes any sort of trouble. The one big negative is the manual feeder on this printer is terrible. You can waste three sheets of labels just to get one decent one printed out that isn't crooked. That's a big drawback if you print any sort of label sheet or index sheet regularly.
1,Piece of Junk,"After just a few months, the print began to fade from the center of pages. HP warranty provided for a new ""reconditioned"" machine to be sent to me; same problem, right out of the box. Avoid this one at all costs."
5,Serious Business,"if you don't own this album you're on (...). Springsteen and Neil Young are in trouble. Very important music, listen to it and enjoy it."
4,Groovy,"I found this CD the other night while I was looking through my collection and had to wonder what happened to these guys. On their sophomore set, this foursome blended old school soul sensibilities with mid-90's production values.The video for the popular song on this CD, ""I Can Call You,"" was in heavy rotation on BET in 1995, but it was not played nearly as much on radio. I like that song because it has a jazzy sound to it, and the four harmonize really well throughout the selection. Plus, I love that thumping bass line.This CD also has some some good slow jams such as the title cut, and my favorite ""Much Too Much."" ""Loving You is Alright"" is a nice midtempo cut. Although I do like their cover of ""How Deep Is Your Love,"" I like their original compositions more. It's not a bad cover, I just don't feel it's worth a rave. On the whole, this is solid group with a grasp of the fundamentals -- lyrics, melody and harmony. It would be a shame if this is the last we'll ever hear from them."
5,Good album,A really relaxing album. Overall good. Songs like Much Too Muchand How Deep Is Your Love really did if for me. Worth buying.
2,not received the stuff,"where is my stuff, i still not received yetplease response my review, and make me happy to buy from amazon.com"
3,Decent but small,"The earrings look nice but don't stick out much off of the ear. I thought they would be bigger but they are diamonds, right?"
1,Very small,Bought this as a Christmas gift but when they came they were so small I couldn't find the second ear ring in the bag. Needless to say I sent these back.
2,CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?,"I ordered these as an ""extra"" gift for my Mom. It would have been an embarrassment to give these to her. They are so small that they would go through the piercing hole in her ear. Very, very disappointed. I am returning for my $46.00 refund."
4,Very good for the price!,I bought it for my niece and she loved it...It's small but beautiful!I think its the perfect gift for any woman!!!
1,no sparkle at all,"i was looking for a tiny diamond stud to put on my ear lobes, the size and fit was perfect, but i don't believe they are real diamonds. the gems are so dull, my mineral water bottle has more sparkle than it."
3,Smaller than they appear,I purchased these for my wife but ended up giving them to my daughter due to the tiny size.
5,Loved these!,"I have three holes in each ear and I really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes. These are wonderful! They are small, but exactly what I wanted. Such a great buy for this price!"
3,I was husband of the year anyway,"Saw these on the Deal of the Day two days before Valentine's day at the bargain price of $29.95 with free overnight shipping. Couldn't pass it up. They're tiny little diamond chips, so the image is misleading (hey, you have to be realistic about your expectations... I knew that 1/10 ct tw meant that they would be small, so I don't have much sympathy for someone who thought they were getting the Hope Diamond for under $30 based on the picture), but that didn't matter... she was surprised and thrilled to get something since we usually don't exchange Valentine's Day gifts. It was the thought that counted, and it made her day."
1,too small,this item is too small and the quality was not so great so i had to return it. i think this would only b good for lil kids
2,"So tiny, these earrings are nearly Invisible!","Purchased these earrings for $29.99 around Christmas during a Gold Box deal. For thirty bucks, I figured why not? Well, when the package arrived, I opened it to find a small pouch. I am not exaggerating when I say it took me five minutes to find these tiny, tiny earrings in the pouch. I had to turn the pouch inside out to find them! Even for thirty dollars, I don't feel these earrings are right for an adult. Maybe a toddler or infant. Wound up sending them back, thanks to Amazon's super return policy."
2,A little small,"While I suppose I shouldn't expect much for $30, the picture of the earrings on an ear showed that they would be bigger than what they are. They are tiny little things, though overall they look nice. I was just expecting an earring that was at least twice the size."
4,Pretty good for the Price,"I bought these for my girlfriend for valentines day, the price was right and she loved them. Only thing is they are very tiny and can have a small tendency to fall out of her ears. All in all a good gift for someone special, and havent had a problem with them at all."
3,it was ok,"It looked good. But again for the price i am not complaining about the size of it, but i wish there are a better way to quantify the size of it."
2,pastey,"my 10 yr old son bought this for his mom and if i had my way they would be returned,the stones look pastey and nothing like the picture"
2,Way smaller than I thought they'd be.,"Hope the wife doesn't kill me! On a budget, and it seemed like these would be a nice gift from the photo, which is pretty misleading. Oh well. No going back now, it's too close to Xmas."
1,Good for a younger person,This product was very cloudy and much smaller then expected. I understood that it was 1/10th kt but I was still expecting the coloring to be of better quality. Just not what I wanted. This product may be better for a younger child but not good for an adult.
3,those earings,"anon timeas promised, but far warning the earing are so small it was hard for ne to hold on to them, the picture of them from the site is bogus and a real real close up"
2,dissapointed,"The earrings I purchased were very disappointing, because of their size. They are baby-size!You need to advertise the size of the product!"
2,VERY TINY - not worth it,The image online DEFINITELY magnifies these earrings. I've owned 1/10 ct stones before and I'd have to say I'm in the process of taking these to a jewler to have them verified. There is barely no setting to them at all. They are so tiny and so cheaply set that they could very possibly slip right through the hole in your ear if you're not careful. Were they worth the money even though it was a really good price? NO. Don't waste your money or even your time looking at these.
2,Desepcionante por el tama√±o del articulo.,"He comprado este producto recientemente y al principio pens√© que estaba a buen precio pero me decepciono el tama√±o de los mismos, realmente seria bueno que en la presentaci√≥n pongan referencia al tama√±o pues es decepcionante, la calidad en si es buena y el articulo muy hermoso no hay que confundir, pero lo decepcionante es el tama√±o son demasiado peque√±as, las compre para un regalo a una bebe y la suerte que fue para una bebe. Solo volver√© a comprar nuevamente joyas si tengo una referencia del tama√±o ya sea con una moneda u otro articulo."
2,Too small,"I guess the price should have been a clue, but these earrings are so small that they have slipped out of my ear on 2 occasions. Probably OK for child."
2,diamond ear rings,"Not sure that they are diamonds in gold. They hurt my ears,when theyre not suppost to. I cant take fake,my ears hurt unless they are gold."
1,Bad diamonds,"The diamonds look like dirty glue dots. The backings were so small, they are very hard to handle and the metal is sharp to the touch."
3,10K White Gold Round-Cut Diamond Studs,"The earrings are very tiny. The diamond is barely visible, the picture is not true to size. If you are looking for an earring to wear alone, I would not recommend, otherwise they are perfect for a second earring or if you are looking for tiny."
1,Wasn't expecting much but....,"I wasn't expecting much for a small dimond with I2-I3 clarity. For those of you who do not know much about dimonds, I2-I3 means there are 2-3 flaws in the dimond visible to the eye. I got these dimonds for my baby daughter. I liked the idea that they are small, but they are way to cloudy and do no sparkle at all! Returning to Amazon for a refund."
1,studs,These are so not worth the time. The stones are so small it makes no sense to wear them and dont' even think the thought of giving them as a gift - the receiver will be vex with you for life. LOL
1,Very cloudy,I wanted a small pair of diamond earrings. I knew the size can be very small... but I didn't expect the stones to be this cloudy. They don't even look like diamond. Don't buy it if you are looking for some sparkles!
1,Don't fall for false advertising,The actual studs are much smaller than what they appear to be in the pictures. Also the diamonds are poorly cut and have a milky hue with no clarity or sparkle. They look like pieces of smoked glass rather than real diamonds.
1,oNLY ONE EARING NOT TWO!!,WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO SHIP THE OTHER EARING PLEASE!! pLEASE SHIP ANOTHER EARING AS SOON AS POSIBLE. tHIS WAS A xMAS PRESENT.
1,Misleading to say the least,I did not think the earrings would be huge but I did expect to be able to see them with the naked eye. These are too small for even a newborn. I would not order them for anyone older than 5 days old. I think if I put these in my ears they will go through the hole in my ear. If you want more bling than these earrings just buy a stick pin and put it in your ear it will be larger than this diamond. Huge disappointment.!!!!
3,Is it real diamond?,"I got this box that says the jewelry was made in China, diamond is cloudy Its cheap and serve its purpose of a gift for my teen cousin; however its something I personally would never buy for myself."
1,I hate it,bad service and price. Very Orden and full shipped. Excelent presentation. Good work. Its very nice item. Full services and Very type.
1,too small and cloudy to be worth anything,I agree with the review that said these earrings are overpriced and ridiculously small. The picture is very misleading. These earrings are tiny to the point of being invisible.
3,Should have known,"For the price I should have known they would be ""very"" small! They will be perfect for my 5 year old grand daughter though!"
2,Sooo tiny,"Even though the purpose of these earrings were for my 13 yr old daughter .. she asked for stud earrings, however, they are barely visible. I was very disappointed when I opened the box. Also the backing on one of the earrings bent very easily when we took them out of the packaging."
3,10k white gold round diamond stud earrings,"Can't complain about the service that, as always, was faultless - but the image of the earrings needs to clarify the actual size. The earrings are very small (approx.twice that of a pin head). I did expect them to be small for the price they were, but maybe not qite as tiny as they are. Probably still good value as they claim to be actual diamonds set in white gold."
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"I purchased these far in advance for Christmas, and hid them for safety. Still not found. Would not have used as a gift as these were MICROSCOPIC in person. Disappointed in item"
3,Smaller than I thought,"The sparkle was beautiful, but the earrings were SO tiny that I didn't even think they were in the pouch they came in...they were supposed to be a gift and I was embarrassed to give them because they were so little..."
2,Good for newborns,"So tiny! I got them for my mom but I had to give it to my newborn niece. Cannot see the diamonds...just a little spark in the middle. So remember: ""you get what you pay for"""
1,Buyer Beware,"One star for fast shipping, but these were pinhead sized and definitely not worth 1/2 the price. Kudos to Amazon for removing the misleading picture however I do think the add is still misrepresenting the value of the earrings."
3,Diamond Stud Earring,I was not very impressed with the 10k white gold round diamond stud earring. The stem was a little long and when wearing them touch the back of my ear all the time. They were not as pretty as you showed them.
3,diamond earrings,"The earring is not as big as it appears in the picture but is good for the purpose I need which is as a second earring to compliment another earring. It would be too small for the primary earring for an adult however, would be nice for a child. I purchased them at a really good price and feel with the quality and all I received my money's worth."
3,exchange for a larger size.,"This was to be a gift for my mother. After receiving them I thought I would exchange for a larger size. I had a hard time with returning item as I did not take computer receipts, and the girl did not know how to return an online purchase. I was going to buy a 1/2 ct. but the price on the earrings was missed marked."
1,price change,Not sure what happended but these earings have gotten very poor reviews but the price went up from 26.00 to 51.00 not the product I'm going to purchase. Bad reviews = raising the price to this company????
2,Smaller than I anticipated,I returned the item because they were much smaller than I anticipated. Picture is somewhat misleading. However return was simple and easy.
2,Too small,After buying the diamond stud earring I was disappoint with the size of the earrings looking at the picture will fool you telling the truth is the answer a buyer want not to be fool
1,Very Tiny !,I returned these as they almost slip through the whole in your ears. You could lose them very easily.
5,Earrings,I have three pierced holes in each ear. This earring is perfect for the top hole to be followed by other earrings in the other holes. I think this would be too small to use as the main earring.
1,"Was hoping for a decent earring, but...","I started looking for a pair of earrings to wear in my second hole. When I found these, I thought they would be great, they were the right price, and looked like a nice pair. However, when I received them and put them on, the backings were too loose for the post (so I had to put stoppers on the backs)and I lost both earrings within a couple of days. They also infected my ears within a day. I expected an earring that's advertised as 10k Gold to not cause an infection, but I was wrong. Buyer beware! These really aren't worth the money! Find a different pair of earrings that may cost a little more."
1,Garbage,"I wasn't expecting anything special for the price, but these are completely worthless. The 4 prong setting they're in is both larger and sparklier than the stones. I was hoping to get a tiny little piece of sparkle, and instead, a grey little chunk of rock in an ugly, unpolished chunk of metal. You're much better off buying plastic than this poor excuse for the real thing. Do not let the picture fool you, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the product that will arrive."
4,Tiny but cute,"These do sparkle a little and the color was pretty acurate in the description. Not clear but not yellow either. They are pretty small so be sure the person who wears them is not the gaudy, flashy type."
2,still hasn't shipped!,"I purchased this about two and half weeks ago along with some other things. the other things have arrived, and yet this hasn't even been shipped. the estimated delivery is over two weeks, which means I will have waited over a month to receive the earrings by the time I finally get it. That is bad service. I will write another review rating the actual product when I receive it. Had I known it would take so long, I would have just paid more and went to the jewelry store down the street."
5,Ethereal Engagement,"Mr Sokolowski has produced a work of fine art in this (nearly solo) recording. These original piano compositions convey the listener into the cerebral ether while maintaining full engagement with their heart. Articulate and structurally complex, these six pieces will be sure to stay fresh and interesting even after multiple listenings. I heartily recommend this album!"
1,"Blame Canada, indeed!","Without fail, I have a BAD DAY every time I am forced to hear Mr. Powter's song.Way to go, Quebec! First you give us Celiene Dion, and now you subject us to this forth rate, Elton John rip-off. What did America ever do to you?Quebec, you should have stoped after giving the world William Shatner, Gravy Fries, and Mario Lemiuex. However, after unleashing Celine Dion and now Daniel Powter on the world, I feel obliged to report Quebec to Kofi Annan and the U.N. for the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction!"
2,One Hit Wonder,"I live in Toronto, so Daniel Powter has been playing here for a LONG time. Bad Day was popular in summer of 2005, so when most people here it now, they scream! Radio stations have tried promoting ""jimmy gets high"" and ""free loop"" with little to moderate success. frankly, i think this guys a one hit wonder"
1,Let the vomit flow.,"In five to eight years' time, millions of copies of this CD will be nestled snugly against James Blunt and Aqualung in the reject bin at your local music store, I guarantee it.Whining like a sickly eight-year-old seems to be the ""in thing"" for male vocalists these days. Five years ago it was yelling and screaming like a mental hospital patient with a broken toe. From one extreme to the other, I guess.Do not waste your money on this trash."
1,WRONG MP3,"Really like this album. I even liked it more after I got the correct one. Be advised that the MP3 Album download associated with this album by Daniel Powter is NOT the one you will get if you buy the mp3 album to download. You will get a self-titled album called ""Daniel"" by Daniel."
1,great music,haven't recieved it yet.looking forward to hearing it.lots of reviews about him.anxious to get it.wish it were here allreadylisten to my music while i play games on my pc.
1,Bad Day is all that is Good on this album,"I bought this album of course for Daniel's song ""Bad Day"" which was heard all the time elimination day on American Idol. It was a different sound and was enjoyable. I cannot say that about the rest of the album. The songs are garbage and Daniel uses a really annoying higher octive in most of these songs that often times sounds way strained. If you are looking for other songs on this album like ""Bad Day"" don't waste your time or money. They aren't on this album. I have tried on numerous occasions since I bought this album the day it was released to get through the whole album. I figured it may be one of those albums I have to be in the mood to listen to. Nope. It is just awful."
1,Computer programming at it's best!,"Let's face it - this guy has no talent. The computer and drum programming are pretty good, but the background strings are really annoying. Just about anyone today can do an album like this with really good computer programmers, software, and a large record label that is willing to market you.This is another prime example of an over-hyped no talent artist with canned music in the background. ""Having a Bad Day"" was a catchy tune - but as other's have stated, the lyrics lack depth, it's a one trick pony, and they guy can't sing.I bet he is laughing all the way to the bank though! Because we all got suckered into buying this.If you like ""Teeny Bopper"" ""Bubble Gum"" music - you will like this album - if you are looking for something with some soul - look elsewhere. The fact is - there is very little soulful music these days. Why don't we just throw away all the computers and see who really has some talent?Can I get my money back?"
4,"I've only heard ""Bad Day"" and ""Jimmy Gets High"" but I loved them both","I was introduced to this song earlier than most of my friends because it was a big hit in France and I heard it on the radio loads of times. Then I heard ""Jimmy Gets High"" on the radio and I really liked that one, too. I can't pass a judgement on the rest of the songs or on the CD in general, but I'm going to buy it because two songs that you like is a pretty good deal and this CD isn't THAT expensive, for a CD. None of his songs can ever be as good as ""Bad Day"", but if they're fun to listen to, it's all good."
3,Daniel Powter CD,Not enough music on CD but what was there was very good. I personally think a lot of his music sounds a like. I purchased for the song So You've Had a Bad Day and I do enjoy this song.
4,some better than others,"Like the WORLD, I heard ""had a bad day"" and it's infectious message and melody haunted me...so I got the cd and like most of it. It's more varied stylistically than I expected but some nice surprises."
2,Good music; bad CD; poor treatment of fans,"I love his music. It is the same style found in other artists like James Blunt and KT Tunstall lately. My only complaint is that I listen to music through my IPOD and this CD's copyright protection scheme prevents computers from being able to read it. I hope in the future such albums are sold with a large, clear, and visible warning. And its a bit of a cruel joke given that Daniel's website is constantly giving away IPODs in contests. I really think this copyright protection scheme has done irreparable damage to his career by significantly limiting his exposure. [UPDATE] After reading other reviews it is evident that the recently manufactured 're-release' of his album with additional tracks in 2007 do not have the copyright protection scheme present. It is nice to know that the fans who supported his career in the beginning are being blatantly walked over."
4,Something After A Bad Day... :),"To think that a lot of people told me he sounds gay is utterly atrocious. I mean he just sounds like that when he sings. Why can't you people get that! I must admit this album is something for everyone despite it's short play of just only 10 tracks. I will not compare him to James Blunt because that would already be judging him. Which is no good because we have to look at what artists are trying to convey in their music. You all know that music is a form of expression. So they're expressing themselves. Totally no harm in doing that and it sounds good after a bad day for those of you under a lot of stress. This music can break stress right out of you. Anyways this album is encredibly listener friendly. And you won't find yourself skipping through any tracks at all. I tried, but I couldn't resist hearing every track first. A good debut! Well Done!"
4,Amazing First CD,"I just bought this CD last week and I'm in love with it! It's so rare to find a CD where you enjoy the majority of the songs, let alone from a new emerging artist.I've already listened to the CD several times and found that although it has tones of Maroon 5 and a few other artists, it's still very uniquely Daniel Powter. As I mentioned, I enjoy most of the songs, especially Bad Day, Free Loop, Song 6, Suspect and Give me Life.Overall I would definitely recommend taking a chance on this CD, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,New Age Supertramp Anyone?,"OK I can't myself here, but this guy really listened to a lot Supertramp growing up or something. I liked to album, but I can hear hints of Supertramp's style in about half the songs here in different degrees. ""Bad Day"" probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the ""Breakfast in America"" album to me. Still the album is enjoyable though, especially if you did like Supertramp. I get the Leo Sayer hook, but I think it's off a bit. Leo never used that many keyboards."
2,"Bad Day is great, the rest isn't","I give up. I've listened to this album multiple times looking for something as good as ""Bad Day"". I've come to the conclusion that it just ain't here. Fans have raved about the diversity of styles on this album, and, yes, there is some diversity. But the truth is that regardless of the style, none of the songs (save Bad Day) is particularly catchy or even particularly memorable. This one is going back on the shelf after I pull Bad Day to a good compilation disc. Sorry."
2,More of the same,"I'm lucky, I managed to get this CD for free. I snatched it up because I enjoyed Bad Day, and thought this artist sounded like somebody that could be great.Instead, after I put it on my iTunes (and for the record, I had no problems at all loading it onto my computer, and I have TWO burners) I usually hit skip. The songs aren't BAD. They're just not that GREAT either. They're really rather non-descript and I can't recall most of them now that I'm sitting here trying.I also don't like Powter's voice in several of the songs, including one most people love, Jimmy Got High. He's singing far too high for his range, and it just comes out falsetto and hard on the ears. I reccomend getting songs you like from a music download service, but skipping the whole album unless you've heard and liked it all."
4,"Hiphop meets german, french, englich ... esperanto","Ich schreibe mal in deutsch, da ich denke,m wer sich f√ºr diese (deutsche) Band interessiert, der spricht auch ihre Sprache. Aber das ist nicht unbedingt n√∂tig. Freundeskreis sehen den Hiphop als ein Mittel der weltweiten Kommunikation, das √ºber jede sprachliche Barriere erhaben ist. H√∂rt rein... relax... Esperanto!"
2,This trimmer is pretty good.,"This trimmer performs much like a gas powered trimmer--at the cost of one, too. It is pretty good--but pricey. Because is is so expensive, I cannot say it is a ""5 star"" value. It trims grass well."
2,Disposable Wacker.,"The Ryobi 150r battery-operated weed-whacker is, in itself, not a bad product, but after using it sparingly over the course of about 3 years, the battery died and resuscitation efforts were absolutely futile (mouth-to-mouth resulted in nary a shock).Moreover, I haven't been able to locate a replacement battery - neither from [a local stor], where I bought the 150r nor via the Ryobi website.I guess this is truly a disposable whacker."
4,A necessary component of the martial artists library.,"I have read this book and I must say it is a necessary component to the martial artists' library. The first three chapters provide the reader with an easily understandable explanation of martial arts theory. This book can be used by the beginner to gain a basic idea of the arts or by the adept to assist in their learning. The other chapters, through the use of pictures, provide a great help to the practitioner in serving as a research resource."
2,dv9060us,"I expected a little more performance for a top of the line Hewlett-Packark Laptop. Over all even with 2 gigabyt's of memeory the laptop is sluggish and hanges up. Guess I will have to wait to see if the VISTA upgrade helps. It came with an HD DVD movie however it was not for playing on a US region DVD player. It was for France, I called Amazon, they wanted me to return the entire laptop, wish I had now. They credited my account $10.00 finallt for a $25.00 HD DVD. I will not purchase any tech items from Amazon again"
3,Premeasured Speed Spool Line.,"These prepackeged lengths of line are great for easy installation. Installing line on the Speed Spool is the easiest thing to do and it hardly gets jamed. However, I gave it a 3 for poor line durability. This type of line demenishes rather quickly due to it's thinness. If you want more durable line, I would get the .095 line thickness. (orange colored line) It lasts longer and is a lot more durable."
2,Are you too busy to measure?,"If you really don't want to bother measuring replacement line before you refill your Ryobi line trimmer, this item is for you. It includes two sets of refills that will get you back to work in 5 minutes. But if you had an extra 5 minutes to measure out ten feet of line off of a bulk spool of trimmer line, you could save a lot of $$$. I won't buy it again."
4,String Trimmer,My string trimmer ran out of string and I order refill. I refilled the trimmer and has used it since.
5,Stand-up company.,"My first shipment didn't arrive, when I emailed them I got a no-questions-asked reshipment within days. For such a small purchase they gave me very the service of an important customer."
1,Never Received an issue,"Ordered in early Feb, Its just about June and I have never received an single issue.Do not order your subscription to this magazine on Amazon."
4,Encouraging,"This book would probably be inspiring for someone not already enjoying writing letters and receiving them. Already a letter-writer, I enjoyed it but won't keep it. Some of her suggestions are pricey and might sound funny; so take from this the main point, and use what you can to enjoy letter writing."
4,Inspiring and encouraging,"I read this book several years ago, shortly after its release in hardcover. Always an avid letterwriter, I found in this book several reasons to remain one in the electronic age. I recently gave a copy of the paperback version to a friend, and it changed his way of looking at letterwriting. He sent me a letter to thank me for it - something he could more easily have done in person or over the phone, as he only lives across town from me. The only complaint I have is the myriad of references to sources for letterwriting accessories and stationery which either sell exorbitantly priced goods or are in far-flung locations the average reader will not likely visit. Even this would have been all right if it had been balanced with more references to mainstream sources. Overall, however, a marvelous read."
4,"good music, better memories","I hadn't heard this stuff in decades, and if anything, it was better than I remembered. Very cool California hippie/biker blues band. Clearly repectful of the tradition, these guys were good players (fine harp and guitar) and evolved a unique sound. I'm surprised (like another reviewer) that they left off ""Fried Hockey Boogie,"" but I guess this disc is meant to emphasize the straighter blues stuff and downplay the 60s wierdness. Too bad, if you ask me. Still, a fine, bluesy party disc. Recommended."
4,Good Overview of Canned Heat,"My first experience with Canned Heat was the album ""Boogie With Canned Heat."" At the time I wasn't that much into blues, but these guys changed all that. They had a creative way of taking hard core blues, and making it fun and danceable to a white seventeen year old kid. With this collection, I feel that it only skims the surface of the band's music. The biggest flaw with this anthology is that it has too many cuts released after the band's heyday. Now that the original albums are becoming available on C.D. I would recommend the following. Start off with ""Boogie With Canned Heat."" Then go to ""Living The Blues."" And last ""Hallelujah."" After that it's all down hill for the band. These guys were the gateway for me to start listening to the original songs cut by the original black blues artists. Good place to start.Feltontom"
1,REVIEWING YOUR WHOLE SITE.,"WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE LET US LISTIN TO THE WHOLE SONG,INSTEAD JUST A 30 SECOND BIT."
4,"High variety, Low detail.","Great for those who need a reference to a diverse pool of names fitting geographical conditions. Not useful for finding when a name was used or what mutations exist. It is therefore ideal for gaming, but for other applications, may only serve as a rib in your library, not part of the backbone of collection."
4,A good movie,i liked this film because a promise made was a promise kept. It was not easy and with the help of the community and some people it all worked out. A typical happy ending film.
3,slightly above average TV movie,"As I watched this rather predictable movie, I realized I saw it when itfirst played on TV. It is about a teenage son (Rick Schroeder) tryingto keep his siblings together after his mother dies, and his father hasnever been a stable influence or presence. Done competently if formulaicand based on a true story, it holds the viewers interest, if the subjectmatter is relevant to you."

5,"Cape Cod Cop: a.k.a. Officer ""Crash""","I won't tell you why Alec Wilkinson was given the dubious nickname of ""Crash"" while he served on the Wellfleet Police force. You'll have to read the book to try and figure that one out! What I can tell you is that Midnights is one of the most amusing true stories I have ever read. It's like a real-life Mayberry.. Barney Fife and all! Originally published in 1982, Wilkinson describes his personal experiences as a small town cop on Cape Cod. Fresh out of college with a music degree, he was looking for work in the summer of '75. Wilkinson gave law enforcement a try. So what if he had no police training! As you will read, it was one bizarre summer and off-season that followed. Memorable too. And Wilkinson candidly recounts his year with the men in blue, often with sidesplitting humor! It's no wonder why this comical gem is back in print."
3,Not that endearing,"I had to read this book for a class and there is no other reason why I would have. ""Memoirs"" is a favorite genre of mine, but this one was not interesting to me in the least, much of the reason because I was not sympathetic to the author and cared nothing for him, felt no connection. Blech.If you want to read good police-accounts, check out ""into the kill zone"" or ""blue blood,"" which - though very long - is a better read."
3,"Compact and nice materials, but It's noisy","It's practical and compact for a 15"" laptop, but the zipper handlers hit each other creating a lot of noise when you walk around. Other brands offer plastic covers for them."
4,"Nice Music, Nice People","This is a solid album with two country stars - one of them (Atkins) a legend - who appeal to a broad market. In other words, this CD isn't to just be enjoyed by country music fans, but everyone who likes good music and two solid artists.I disagree with the ""editorial review"" above which somewhat trashes Bogguss. I always found her voice extremely pleasing and albums to be uplifting. Atkins was doing more than trying to help a nice woman's career; he also appreciated Suzy's talent.Overall, its a compilation of songs that will have you humming them in no time.....and putting a smile on your face. Just listening to these two, you know you are listening to very nice people as well. It comes across that way.As another reviewer says here, it's too bad this is out of print but getting a used copy is a lot better than no copy. It's definitely worth a purchase."
3,3.5 rating. Kinda misses the mark.,"Darn. This album opens with a fun, jauntily stripped-down acoustic version of the Jimmie Rodgers oldie, ""In The Jailhouse Now"" -- exactly the kind of sound I was hoping this album would have -- but it soon slides into soft, over-orchestrated Nashville pop, stuff that misses the mark, as far as I'm concerned. There are a couple of tunes that dip back into the simpler style (and they are also pretty nice), but this is one of those guess-they-just-can't-help-themselves outings in which two talented artists who have sometimes-rootsy leanings let their love of studio technique get the best of them. These two are, indeed, simpatico, but it extends to the poppy stuff as well as the more traditional. Bogguss & Atkins fans probably won't be disappointed, but grumpy traditionalists like myself will find this a bit too goopy."
5,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING,THIS BRACELET IS SO PRETTY.I WEAR IT WITH MY WHITE WATCH AND MY ONYX BRACELET AND EVERYTHING.IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE AND FEMININE.I HAD PRICED ANOTHER ONE AT A JEWELERS AND IT WAS $100.00 !!!AGAIN SILVER INSANITY DOES IT WITH BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I CAN AFFORD.
3,Its not so good,"The problem with this skin is not its function cause it truly protects the player, is just that the silicone material feels kinda cheap, of course for that price you can't ask 4 more, but if you can afford a leather case I would recommend it."
4,crue tribute album,"I listen to a lot of Crue, but I really bought this one mostly for the John Corabi tracks. Overall, the whole tribute album is pretty cool."
1,SALSA is no more than Cuba SON.,"This is another book which tries to cheat, to lies us about the so called SALSA. It is well known among musicians greats and musicologists that Salsa is the Cuban SON and the renaming of such Afro-Cuban music has political reasons and not musical reasons. Cuba has been isolated from part of USA and not the other way around as part of the cold war. So there is NOT any musical ""evolution"" from Salsa to SON and therefore the book is a bunch of lies.In addition, another purpose of such denomination of the Cuban SON is to try to give many Latinos in USA an identity that they never had it and STILL don't have.SALSA is no more than Cuba SON."
5,Three Works of Genius on One DVD,"Briliant...simply brilliant.Watch it today, tomrrow and often.You will see something new and funny each time you view"
4,Great DVD,"I don't know how much my toddler watched it, but i enjoyed it quite a bit. I'm sure he'll come to appreciate it more in the near future..."
5,Nick Park,"This was selected for my aunt in Washington State. I had it sent to her directly from you. I do not know if she has viewed it yet, but she told me it arrived in perfect condition."
2,Which is it then?,"The product description shows this:Format: Animated, Color, Dolby, DVD-Video, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSCA few lines down this:Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1How can this product be both widescreen and 1.33 aspect ratio at the same time? Which is it then?"
5,Popular and Timeless,"This product has been an absolute hit with my 5-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl. They have probably seen each episode at least 50 times. Always fun, always gets a laugh or comment. Teaches kids about cheese too, if that is a good thing. Recommended.Oh...but it does teach that the moon is made OUT of cheese...maybe not such a good thing."
4,A great deal for the money!! <333,"While it is on the cheap end for a cordless phone, it is also on the quality end as well. I have found this phone is better than I had expected for the price. It gets scratchy here and there, but that's what they make a channel button for on the phone!! ^_~ I recommend this one 100%!! <333"
4,Classic,Just had to have for an old time foxhunter in Arkansas. However I did read them before gifting to him!
1,Unacceptable,"The story was wonderful, but the typeset was terrible. The type was so large that the person I gifted with the book said she would put it on the opposite side of the room to read it comfortably. The second book I ordered to replace the first was printed in 1980 and the pages were dark and weathered. I have ordered Mackinley Cantor out-of-print books from Amazon before and have been satisfied as they were current printings. What happened to those publishers? Why has Amazon not continued to distribute their work? I speak specifically of the University of Michigans's printing of ""Daughter of Bugle Ann"".A Disappointed Customer."
5,Denalij Digital Angle Protractor works!,It worked well for me. I found this to be an essential tool for installing crown molding in a room with 14 non-standard inside and outside corners.
2,Sure the protractor functions reads but the bubble levels are really off!,"I've got to say, as soon as I opened the packaged I eyeballed the bubble levels and they looked off. After testing against 4 other levels I own, I estimated these bubble levels to be off by almost 5-10 percent. Both of them. This is not acceptable for a simple part of a ""measuring tool"". I do find the angle reader to be within .10 of degree with some fussing at times. I am disappointed with a tool that fails simple tasks. If you don't mind the give an take with accuracy and price, get this, if not don't bother."
3,Useful but not handy,"Oh I thought it would use it more than I have, it is fairly accurate. I don't really care for it much mainly because of preference not quality. It is fairly compact."
2,Guage not accurate,"I ordered and returned the Denali Digital Angle Protractor. It did not read accurately across the 180 degree range I tested. It is a nice looking unit and if it were accurate and consistant it would be a great buy. Apparently some of them are accurate, but I did not want to keep sending them back until I got a good one."
2,Not accurate enough,I have just returned this item to Amazon. It is well-made and would be perfect if it were only more accurate. Unfortunately its readings are in error by amounts that vary with the angle read and at worst are almost half a degree in error. For carpentry work it would probably be fine but I do segmented wood turning where one needs very accurate cuts so this was useless for me.
4,I really wanted to rate this lower...,"...but for $20 I couldn't bring myself to do it. My unit was .7 degrees off. Closed or open 180 on a flat surface. I am a commercial cabinet maker and use my Bosch quite often. There are job sites where angled walls are too short to use the Bosch unit and I thought this one would come in handy. With no way to adjust it I ended up sending it back, but i suppose I could have just subtracted/added the .7 degrees depending on the angle I was measuring.Just as a side not I have owned the bosh unit for years, dropped and abused it and it is still a quality unit even though I do not care for their other tools. I will most likely end up buying the Denali again as soon as I see a floor plan come across my desk where it would be useful and just hope for better quality."
3,It is lacking capability to calculate angle for stairs,"It needs extention to calculate angles for stairs, this small addition to it will make it more useful"
1,Not a good deal,"The ACCURACY is specified on the included spec sheet as +- 1 Degree. a carpenters square measures 88.9 degrees which is probably with in the +- 1 degree. a plain old plastic protractor can be estimated to close to a .1 degree.the description on the website says ""computes angles accurately to +/- 0.1 degrees"" this is bull!fred"
3,It's not a Bosch,"I had purchased some time ago Bosch's angle protractor for our installation tool set. We recently had a need in our shop for a similar tool, so I bought the Denali. It definitely works and I would put it in the catagory of a good tool, but it isn't any where near the quality tool the Bosch unit is, and I would say if you have the money buy the better tool. You won't be disappointed. The Bosch is more accurate, has more features and is better made."
4,Denali protractor,"I bought this to use to install crown molding. So far I have not used it on the job, but from everything I can see, it should do just fine. While I do not have anything to check it out with, it is right on with a square."
5,Shipping,Was advertised as free next day shipping. I was charged and it also 5days to get the product.
1,86 degrees is not close to 90,I got this for a Father's Day present. It's junk. I set it at 90 degrees and it was way off. I measured something that was 90 degrees and got a 86 degree rating. Now I'm returning it and I hope my daughter doesn't find out.
2,cheap copy of the pro site,"The Starrett Pro site is the original one and much better. My dad has one of those and let me borrow it for a project. It was great! This cheapo digital one is not nearly as accurate or versatile, and I'm wishing I'd spent a few bucks more for the real deal."
1,"Great Idea, Problematic Execution","Returning mine. I have two squares at home and this tool states thay are both 89 degrees! I could live with .1 degree off (as claimed here and in the manual), but 1 whole degree off makes this not quite good enough!"
1,A Disaster - DO NOT BUY,"I was so happy with this electronic protractor that i showed it off to everybody i knew had its use.Until one day, i found that the angles it showed were completely inaccurate.The inaccuracy ranged from 2.5 to 7 degrees.The main problem is that this does not have any 'zero' button, where i can calibrate the device. It has a pre-fed zero which can sometimes be inaccruate due to jerks or falls.That is a disaster. I could get get better accuracy with an analog traditional protractor.It was a waste of previous money.I've now ordered a Wixey digital protractor. Because i've got a couple of their other products and they rock..I suggest - DO NOT BUY until a major upgrade"
1,Junk,"Purchased 3 different units - all three were not accurate. If you need the accuracy of a digital protracor, do not waste your money on this one - it is useless"
2,Not sure about this!!,Right out of the box it was 4 degrees off and there is no field calibration provisions. I loosened all of the protractor screws and was able to get it within 1 degree. Time will tell if it's any good.
1,"11"" protractor",A very nice looking tool with a nice case. Unfortunately it is off by as much as 1/2 a degree. We got 2 of these and they were both inacurate.
2,More of a 'Toy' than a 'Tool'.,"This has been on back order for a month. I had been anxiously waiting to finish a large window trimming job thinking this would be the tool I needed for a professional job.You can imagine my disappointment yesterday when I opened it up laid it against my Black & Decker Level and got a reading of 179.5 degrees instead of 180. How the heck can you miss a straight line? Why isn't there a calibration capability to simply reset the reading to a known 180 and get to work?At least I didn't pay a lot for it.Remember people...""You get what you pay for"""
5,Electric Wins Again,"I have just spend the afternoon using this string trimmer for the first time, and I'm extremely satisfied. Two months ago I moved up from my little electric Weed Eater to a Homelite gas 2 cycle string trimmer: darned thing worked twice, then wouldn't start again! When it did run, the engine was awkward to position against my body, it stunk, and was bloody loud (-neighbour guilt.) This Robi really cranked through the tough stuff today: a lower garden area with a metre of grass. The best features: easy-loading string spool, and the two-speed switch it's got. At low speed it is very easy to do fine trimming, then full speed works for the big grass. And, I think my neighbour's a lot happier!"
2,Stay away from all-in-one items!,"I purchased this item along with the edger, and blower attachments. The upper drive shaft on the trimmer gets stripped very easlily, thus making all of your tool useless."
2,Ok but it stinks if the lines jam,"I agree with everyone's assessment that this trimmer is light , easy to load and can cut through moderately thick grass. However, I have had one problem with it. If the line gets jammed or if you don't bump it to release more line fast enough, you have to unscrew the head to reload it... try feeding two lines back into the head when you are hot, sweaty and tired! I don't know if Ryobi offers an accessory that solves this problem."
1,Can't get one anywhere,"This isn't a review of the trimmer; it's a complaint that the trimmer is unavailable anywhere. All the reports say it's the best corded trimmer out there, but GOOD LUCK on finding one!Anyone have any ideas on how to get one? If they're so hard to get, Amazon should really take it out of their lineup. I ordered one three weeks ago (today is June 20) and was told shipping ""may not be until June 28 to July 21"". What's that mean?? Sounds both vague and open-ended. No stars to Amazon for this one......looks like by the time I get it we'll be into the fall, and I won't need it then."
2,Line Jams All the TIme,WHen the line ISNT jammed this trimmer is great. Problem is it jams constantly and the bump knob is nearly impossible to get offfallowing you to get to the line.
3,"Not bad, but not great","I bought this so I could use my tools while my Ryobi 890r 4-cycle power unit was in the shop. Again. And for when it goes in the shop next time, and next...Anyway, this electric version works fairly well. It's great for chopping weeds and blowing leaves. However, it has MUCH less power than the 4-cycle engines, and presumably 2-cycle as well. The vacuum attachment is Useless with this, at least when picking up more than a few small, light, easily suckable leaves.This makes me wary of using the tiller attachment.I'd recommend this to anybody who wants a standby power unit while their's is in the shop, possibly sitting right next to mine. I'd also recommend this unit to folks who need three or so tools, except that it would cost just as much, or less, to buy separate cordless tools, saving the time and trouble of fooling around with a cord."
2,Don't get too close to hard objects,"Brand new, the trimmer spool didn't release cord, so I decided to use it for a few minutes with the cord that was left before going inside to study the instructions. Bad idea. I got too close to some concrete steps and accidentally let the spool contact them. With a tool this powerful, watch out! The spool and casing exploded into shrapnel. The spool is a spare part, but the housing is not. You have to send it back for service. My previous trimmer was a cheap Black and Decker, and I never had problems with the line feed and it seemed rather indestructible. It seems like a very powerful tool, possibly too powerful for its own good. The housing of the spool should be metal, and the drive shaft looks like it could be stripped easily."
2,Switch goes bad often,I have had this trimmer for several years. This is my second one. The trimmer is great EXCEPT for the fact that I have had to replace the trigger switch at least twice every season. This occured on my first and I thought perhaps it was just a lemon. The replacement switches last no longer than the original. I am sure Ryobi planned these to fail since most homeowners would just throw it away. Save yourself the agravation and spend your money on a brand who believes in quality throughout.
5,The best line trimmer ever,"I have had my Ryobi trimmer plus for about 6 years. It is the best electric trimmer I have ever had. I wanted to get another one but for some unknown reason Ryobi thought that gas was better. Not for me I can't stand to use a gas trimmer with the gas smell, the pulling to start the darn thing, and the weight. If Ryobi ever could just come back with this trimmer I would be so happy."
5,I'm here looking for a new one!,"I just threw my Ryobi 132r Trimmer plus in the trash. Yep, darn thing could only take about 10 years of HARD yard work and flower bed construction. In all the years I had it, I replaced one thing on it, the screw down bumper. When I bought it, people who are supposed to know about good lawn care products told me Ryobi was a bad product...wish I could remember who they were, so when I buy my NEW one, I could show it to 'em.You won't be disappointed if you're thinking about buying this trimmer for tough jobs...unless you drag it down the road behind your pickup truck before each use!"
5,Excellent Book!,"I've read the book twice already and love this lady's story. It's very honest and captivating. I don't mind having the older version of the book even though there is a newer edition in print now with a vibrant, pretty cover and pictures of Lydia's life in Jerusalem."
5,Unforgettable Story of an Unbelievable Faith,"I was first introduced to this book a few years ago by my grandfather. It had been read by many members of the family and finally passed down to me. I have been searching for a copy of this amazing book in English (mine is in Russian, so it takes more effort to read through!) and I finally found it! I have read this book 5 or 6 times and I am always inspired and amazed at Lydia's faith in God, but even more so- by God's faith in people! The simple way that the book is written (and it comes across in any language, I think!) is easy to read and hard to put down. One of the greatest books of all time, and should be a classic!"
5,Cleanhead is the man!,"this is a great CD from Eddie Cleanhead Vinson, recorded in 1969 (on the Delmark label out of Chicago)with T Bone Walker, Jay McShann, and Hal Singer. This guy sure knew how to belt out the blues, and played a pretty mean sax, too. Cleanhead had been recording since the late 40's, and I guess you would have to categorize his earlier stuff as ""jump blues"", similar to Louis Jordan, Wynonie Harris, Joe Turner. Anyway, this CD holds up and you will enjoy it a lot."
4,Excellent Book,"I selected this book to be able to learn about Judaism. It is an excellent choice. It arrived on time, and in perfect condition due to Amazon's packaging system. The book is readable and highly informative. I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking information about Judaism."
3,Baruch Ashem,"Books on religion have an inherent problem for me. I want to learn about the faith BUT I don't want to be preached to. A disclaimer - I am Jewish so I have some familiarity with this religion. I would say that very good majority of this book did an excellent job explaining the different reasons for and backgrounds of the many facets to Judaism. Whether one is of that faith or not, the information provided was interesting and the author wrote in an easy, very personal method that I enjoyed. When I came to the final chunk of pages, it seemed a little proselytizing for my taste, but I understand that if you're going to read about Judaism they are going to crow all its qualities. I think It's an enjoyable read for anyone interested in one of the major world religions."
4,Best Introduction to Judaism,"RAbbi Kushner's book without question the most readable, accessible way to understand the basic ideas, rituals and traditions of Judaism whether you are born Jewish or just curious from the outside. This is the first book I give to anyone interested in discovering Judaism. Rabbi Amy Bernstein"
4,Invigorating,"Kushner delivers a work true to its title. To Life is an energetic, meaningful primer to the Jewish religion. Kushner provides an outstanding commentary of the Jewish faith which will positively impact any Jew's decision to return to observance, as well as act as a welcoming introduction for any potential convert. (Like myself.)The one major flaw in Kushner's book has already been noted by other reviewers. Intentionally or otherwise, Kushner does slam the Christian religion a few times during the course of the text. However, overall this remains an inspiring work."
1,inferior sound quality,"Bought this CD to grab a copy of the elusive longer version of ""Love Is Like Oxygen"" but alas, this entire CD has poorer than average sound quality. It sounds like it was dubbed off a cassette."
3,"4 stars for performance, 2 for content = 3 stars","Scofield's playing is on point as always. To me his duo and jazz organ trio are decent but not as spectacular as the quartet performance, which is smoking. Another minus is the lack of bonus features, such as an interview with Sco or backstage footage with the other musicians on the bill. But considering the production values of jazz performances recorded in the early 90's, its likely the record company and the producers were being budget-conscious(i.e., cheap). Too bad. It would have been interesting to know what was going through Scofield's mind back then. He's very insightful, and a pretty funny guy to boot. All in all I still recommend this DVD, just don't expect much beyond the live performance."
4,Works as expected,"The spool is plastic and after 6 years of use, it was ready to be replaced. I was dreading the possibility of buying a new trimmer until I saw this on Amazon. The spool was ordered and arrived in 3 days."
5,Lock & load,"I guess I didn't know what to expect when ordering this item. I was sure there would be only a few feet of string on the spool, probably not enough to do much. Suprise, suprise, it is/was loadedand ready to do serious damage to whatever weed got in its way.Very good product, thank you."
4,Parts as expected - gave new life to my trimmer,"Much better than having to replace the whole trimmer. Now it works well again. And, it was so easy to find the parts from you."
2,Cartridge string problems,The cartridge is easy to put on but I have problems with the dual strings retracting back inside the casting. They continued to go back in the cartridge and unwind. I have to keep taking the cartridge off and re-thread them. I don't know if the cartridge or the Ryobi 825R 4-Cycle Curved Shaft TrimmerPlus is the problem.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I received Ryobi product #181460. The corners of the ratchet on the original spool had been worn down, so the spool did not lock properly. The replacement spool is tooled (designed/manufactured) incorrectly, and demonstrates the same slipping as the original.My suggestion is that you not waste your time even ordering this spool and look for a complete replacement string trimmer. If Ryobi cannot maintain quality standards well enough that the replacement of an wearing item does not meet specifications, you should not give them any of your money. Get a new string trimmer, or spend your time rehabilitating another. I've spent too much time on this one to count. Go elsewhere."
1,Horrible,"Avoid this product, unless you enjoy swearing! I've never had so much buyer's remorse. I spend half my time taking the spool assembly apart because the string breaks off and disappears inside the casing. Ryobi makes fine engines but they screwed up royally with this spooler."
4,No excuses now,"Was considering a 1 star but had to be fair. Since I have received this part, lawn chores are now once again possible."
4,nag nag nag,"what a waste, are you really reading this review of a spool? Yeah it is a spool for the trimmer. I can't believe how many times Amazon nagged me about this stupid review for a trimmer spool. Not like it's rocket science or a computer somebody might actually appreciate a review on..."
5,sturdy and long,Bought this strap to help stretch my legs. The strap is sturdy and the buckle is of good quality too. And the strap is quite long so it's good for tall people too with plenty of strap to hold on to.
3,There are better straps out there,"If you don't want to buckle this strap, then it is fine. But during a yoga class recently, our teacher wanted us to buckle the strap for a certain pose. I finally figured out after the pose was almost over how to turn the end of the strap sideways so it would fit through the slot. It would not go through without turning it. I recently bought two more straps, and they are much easier to buckle. (Gaiam 8-Foot Organic Cotton Yoga Strap)"
3,band is quite slim.,"the 8' cinch buckle cotton strap, even though quite hardy and pretty is actually quite narrow, maybe an inch and a half in width.I certainly was expecting something a LOT wider.. maybe they offer that width in another product."
2,Yoga Strap,"The reason I purchased this strap was to make it easier to carry my mat around over my shoulder.I am sure that it would work out great if the product came with instructions on how to use it.I am sure there are many different ways to wrap the strap around the mat and I do know how touse a Cinch Buckle, but there were no instructions or maybe a ""suggestions on how to use"" piece ofpaper. I do not use this any longer. Feel it was a waste. To replace this I bought theNyon Yoga Mat bag from Amazon, and that was a great purchase."
5,Nice Product. Good Value.,"I was looking for some yoga straps to replace some that I had lost. This time I decided to get longer straps because I 'don't bend' like I used to. I like that these have plastic clips instead of metal and they are a nice material. They are a bit less wide than I'm used to, but that's not necessarily a 'bad thing'.I recommend this product.YogaAccessories (TM) 8' Cinch Buckle Cotton Yoga Strap"
4,Love Green,Got this yoga strap for my father who is obsessed with Astanga yoga and he loves it. It's durable and I ordered the color green which holds up great and doesn't show sweat. I'm please with my purchase.
1,Lasted two weeks.,"Item came and look like it was a perfect match. A little trouble getting installed, but hey! It's an aftermarket replacement. At the end of the first use, it had already worn through, exposing the square nut inside. Within 2 weeks (3 uses) that knob is one-third its original height, having worn the rest of it away. Product had a great price but doesn't last for SQUAT!"
5,Ryobi 181468 Speed Spool Bump Knob Assembly,Couldn't have been easier to find the product to order. I was able to locate my model and find the correct replacement part. It was delivered when promised and works great.
1,Ryobi Bump Knobs,"I thought that buying original parts would save me from buying a new weed eater, but I was wrong. The part did not work as it just kept spooling off the nylon uncontrollably. I have to now consider buying a new machine."
1,Low Quality,"First of all, this part is not made by Ryobi, but it is an universal part used by other brands that have the quick change spool system. So it is not problem who makes the part.This part consists of three components - the knob, the spring and a foam ring. The only component that will break is the foam ring. The one that came with mine crumbed in my hand when I removed it from the bubble pack. It failed without actually being used! So you paid $8 for the knot and spring which will last longer than the weed wacker itself. Don't waste your money."
1,Lost item,"I ordered 2 of these items August 12, 2001. It is now September 12, 2001, and we still have not received the order. Can the order be tracked? We have called customer service. She stated that the item will reach us in two business days. That was September 8, 2001. We don't have the order, but our account has been charged since August 16, 2001."
5,Perfect replacement knob,This part helped revive an old trimmer that was destined for scrap.Fits perfect and works as it should.
5,Ryobi Bump Knob Assy,"This is exactly what I was looking for and I could not find it locally. Item fit on my string trimmer and everything works well. Fast shipping and a good price, couldn't ask for anything more. Since they do wear out rather quickly I will probably order a couple more."
1,Poor Quality,"The bedding is beautiful and perfect for a little girl. However, it is so poorly made. The stitching is coming undone on the bumper and we are unable to secure it to the crib. We could not recommend this o anyone due to the poor quality."
5,a first and good desicion,"The Craft and Art of Clay by Susan Peterson, Jan Peterson is the first book I have bought on line. I had borrowed it from the University (I am a 2nd year student at Southern Cross) library and when I found myself extending the loan I thought it would be worth purchasing this book. It is even better now I own it. Its simple approach to this art that I have not done before makes this book refreshingly easy to read. It can be used for looking up specifics and for a general thumb-through, for interest.As a person new to ceramics I wanted a book that wouldn't talk over my head and I also didn't want to read it through then find it has nothing more to offer.I have found this book to have both basic and advanced information in an easy to read form. I am very happy to recommend it to every and anyone interested in starting to work with clay for students studying 3D and in particular ceramics and I am sure I will continue refer back to this book, throughout my professional career."
5,Lovely Bible,"This is a lovely edition of the REB. The color and texture of the leather are especially beautiful. Cambridge does it again!!The REB is a good, literary translation, good for reading andcomparison with other translations. The print size is good too.This gets and A+ from me!!"
4,A favorite snack,"I ordered this in January, so chances of melting was minimal. I agree that ordering any chocolate product in the middle of summer may not be the best idea. My order was received in excellent condition and the raisins tasted as expected. Chocolate Covered Raisins are one of my ""all-time"" favorite snacks. I love chocolate and the raisins give me the impression I'm eating something that's not so bad for my health. It's 170 cal for 30 pieces with 6g of fat. However, I usually combine the chocolate covered raisins with mixed nuts and regular raisins. Over half the calories are from the sugars in the raisins themselves. But, when mixed with the other stuff, the number eaten is way less than 30 pcs.The packaging is nice but does make a lot of noise in the shipping box. I worry about what people handling the box might think about the contents. Overall, a delicious snack and when mixed with nuts and other dried fruit, not too detrimental to your health."
1,Product is Stale,Even with my high tolerance for this type of thing these chocoate covered raisins were stale beyond redemption. Not with purchase at any price.
5,Kafka in Drag,"Who wouldn't be impressed? The writing -- especially when Ms. Solis sketches her eerie landscapes -- evinces a precision that rivals Kafka's own. Ms. Solis is a master of transport, and the netherworld to which the reader travels is rich, decadent, pleasured by light and dark."
1,Be Aware: Jennifer Lopez is in only ONE of these 2 movies!,"These are both good movies, but ""13 Going on 30"" featuresJennifer GARNER, not Jennifer Lopez...just know what you are buying! 5 stars for the movies, 1 star for Amazon's movie catalogers!"
5,"Perfect little pan for crepes, tortillas, eggs, chocolate etc.","I used this pan on my induction cook top and it is fantastic to use when you don't need a giant fry pan. There is plenty of room to cook a regular size tortilla or several large eggs. I also used it for dipping things in chocolate since the walls are nice and low. It is easy to get to whatever you have. Turning eggs over is a breeze because of the low walls. I love these pans and I also purchased the 13"" and used it for making large crepes. They all work perfectly. Make sure you read up on seasoning pans and watch a couple youtube videos so you know how to do it. The more you season the pan and use oil in the beginning, the more non-stick it will become. This is a MUST. Once you have it seasoned well, you won't have any problems with food sticking, it will act like a teflon or ceramic pan."
1,Difficult to use....,"This pan conducts and distributes heat extremely well. Unfortunately, that also means the handle gets really hot. Every time I use this pan, I burn myself. The pan is also quite heavy."
4,Romance at its Best,"This is the kind of story which makes you feel all warm inside. You get caught up with the efforts of the hero to win the affection of the heroine, without compromising himself or reneging on a promise. You struggle with the heroine as she tries to come to grips with both her past and her future. I had difficulty putting it down, and the story has remained on my mind.There's a good blend of romance, sex, and conflict. I thought that there could have been a little more mystery. However, the book is obviously a romance first and foremost and not a mystery. Not too much tension, but just enough to capture and hold the reader's interest.If you love a romance, and appreciate reading of African-American heros and heroines who reflect good sound values, then you'll love this book. I did."
3,Good but not as good as her others,"I thought Silken Betrayal was good, its a little different from her other story lines, (them wanting at first sight, dieing to touch, several hot and steamy kisses and love scene), you know! Anyway it took me 2 days to read it, when I usually finish her book in one. I thought it took to long for the heroine and hero to get together, she pushed him away more times then not. The ending however showed promise, it was what saved the book for me and the introduction of Sonja and Drake's story I want to read more about them. She is still one of my favorite authors. I think Undeniable was my favorite."
2,not the best book ever,"I didn't really enjoy Autumn of the Royal Tar for a few reasons. The first reason is it lacked a real plot. It didn't really have a climax or an anti-climax, it was just flat the entire way through. There was nothing that really made me want to keep reading.Another reason I didn't really enjoy this book is because the charactors didn't really have any personality. They all seemed to lack the energy that all good charactors have.Altogether, I'm not sure I would recommend this book to anybody."
5,A Wonderful Medieval Tale With Twists...,"This was one of the best medieval time travel romances I have ever read. A young half Asian woman is transported to medieval France by a wizard intent on rescuing his friend from a doomed future. It is unique in that most such stories usually have Caucasian heroines. Her Asian heritage is critical to the storylne because, being so exotic, people from this era mistake her for a demon or the like. In the modern world the heroine is a sort of film critic. When she first arrives in medieval France, she is forced into the role of storyteller, and the stories she tells, based on movies, put into medieval terms, is hilarious. ""Casablanca"" and the Godfather"" will never look the same to me again! Loved the ending, don't read ahead!"
3,Humour and Drama in this Timetravel Tale,"3.5 stars. I started this some months back and then started reading it from the beginning again after finishing another one of the author's book. It was an enjoyable enough read, plenty of humour (mostly related to Jacques - the Merlin character in this Arthurian story - and Diane's thoughts) and of course some drama (this being in medieval times with unending wars). There were some heart warming moments here, pretty good chemistry between the characters but nothing about the book, the story or characters particularly stands out for me. Enjoyable enough but overall an average read."
5,"Autmn Lord, by Susan Sizemore",This dealer is always reliable. The book arrived quickly and is in good condition.
4,Fits Honda S2000 perfectly,"It looks just like the stock one, and fits just like the stock Honda S2000 part."
4,A great buy for kids who are new to the addiction,"My children are young and new to Pokemon, but are already huge fans, so this series was a must buy to get them to understand where the main character had come from."
3,Eh,"I just received this in the mail, after receiving the other two volumes of the first season. This one came pretty beat up, with scratches on the box. Other than that the disks are in tip top shape! The handling was not good."
4,Nice casual set,"This dinnerware is great for every day use and has a rustic feel about it.The bowls, however, are massive and take up huge amounts of space in the dishwasher (they cannot be nested like my old bowls, there are just too big). The plates are large as well, and somewhat non-uniform in color (that adds to their rustic nature). The saving grace was the free fruit bowls - nice sized for a small snack."
2,SEA DOG: THE VIEWER'S CURSE,"SEAWOLF THE PIRATE'S CURSE is lame, ponderous, and dull. Any attempts at humor fall extremely flat, and the whole movie is limp and flaccid. Thomas Ian Griffith (Final Encounter, Excessive Force) is one of the most bland heroes we've seen in some time. Attempting to be a new Harrison Ford, Griffith only serves to remind us how great Indiana Jones was, and how any movie claiming to be ""like"" it always fall flat. Add Gerit Kling, a lovely German actress, whose accident is almost indecipherable, Barry Flatman who lives up to his last name in his role as a villainous colonel, and assorted chases and you have one cheesy movie. The heroes actually use a coral colored Volkswagen as their getaway car; the bad guys pursue an old Chevy Impala in Suzukis!!! There is little to recommend the film except for some lovely scenery of Cuba.A real dud; 2 stars for the landscapes."
5,I Married You,"This book was recommended to me while I was engaged to my wife. It is an awsome book. Mr. Trobisch cast a very clear and poignant perspective to the relationship of marriage. A perspective only God could give. This book should be required reading for all high school and college students who have thoughts, questions, or ideas about marriage and also required for all of us who are now married. I plan on having this classic in my household for all of my children to read."
5,Damn! Good news about northwest Indiana,"If you live in 'the Region' you need to have this book. Because people in the Region are always putting down the area, and talking bad about the place and saying how they want to move to Chicago or Denver or someplace else. Well-this book tells you that there is some stuff to be proud of in northwest Indiana. I know some stuff he left out, but he's got some stuff in there I never heard of."
3,Internal rip,"I purchased this case 5 months. It's great for passing through airport security, but on a recent trip I noticed the internal flap that Velcros to the partition covering the computer has ripped at the seam. This is a weak spot that the manufacturer could of used thicker fabric."
4,"Sharp bag, makes travle a little easier.","The price is right. I like all the various pockets. it is lighter than expected, and the shoulder strap is comfortable. The best part is the butterfly opening for air travel. You don't have to take your laptop out. Just simply zip the laptop compartment open and slide thru the security belt. Then zip up again and your done. The TSA likes this bag as well. I highly recommend this bag if you travel alot."
5,Great Bag - Security is a breeze - so far no gate check!,"I had an old Samsonite laptop roller and to my horror, was made to gate check it while aboard a CRJ. Needless to say, having to pull out my laptop and hand carry it aboard was traumatic enough for me to scramble for another bag.The Checkpoint-friendly aspect is a breeze - it also has icons on the inside, so even if security doesn't speak English they understand that the laptop is on its own. The main compartment holds a good amount of odds and ends, and it's sturdy enough to take a few hits and not damage anything inside.Only con I would say is I wish they would make it in more colors or patterns...but that's subjective I know =)"
5,Worth Buying. Excellent!!!,This is the Second Targus Laptop bag I bought. It is more than my expectation. Worth Buying.
3,A snap to go through TSA...,Excellent bag for a quick trip through airport security as you don't have to remove your computer... the one drawback is that it stands too tall to fit under the seat in front of you.
4,Excellent for checkpoints,"Could be a little larger, but it has the most important part: a checkpoint friendly pouch for your laptop that means you'll never leave your laptop with security. Well made, rolls well, and very easy to maneuver."
3,Zip thru security but with some flaws,"Pros:1. Easy: The Targus Zip-Thru Case, as advertised, is great for passing through US Airports.2. Look and feel: Conservative and professional look and feel. The bag is professional enough to carry into meetings with clients and has a very classy look that is not too gimmicky or flashy.Con;1. Build Quality: Construction of the shoulder cushion needs improvement. The padding began to show on first use with loaded 15.1inch laptop and completley ripped apart after several use. The bag itself is made up of very durable material.2. Space: With 15.1inch laptop, there was not much room for anything else. I had a hard time finding space for the laptop power supply. With one 200 page book and power supply and laptop, it was hard to fit anything else besides pens.If your travels are light with need to carry just your laptop, I highly recommend this bag."
4,Laptop carrying case,Very nice travel case - my only complaint is a lack of dedicated compartment for the battery charger and cord. Otherwise very nice
3,Too Tight to Travel,"This bag is okay if the lap top would just fit but it is too hard to close the zipper. I have an ASUS 15.4"" and it is very thin. This bag was just too tight for the laptop. Now I have to return it and wait look for something larger. I like the leather handles and the multiple storage compartments but I'm sure Targus has something better."
2,Zip thru feature is useless.,"I was disappointed by this bag. The ""zip thru"" feature is completely useless (at least in european airports), and it is too bulky for the capacity provided. I will go back to my good old backpack."
3,gave me rug burn,"There are some really nice features in this bag. It appears to be sturdy and well made. The pockets are adequate for several files and office essentials, my quart bag of hygene products, and my jacket.I probably would have kept the bag except that the material was so rough that it irritated the back of my arms and neck. I'm a smallish woman, so a larger person may not have the issues with rubbing.I returned the bag and purchased the Case Logic check-point friendly bag which I like very well."
5,Awesome!!!,I bought this for my fiance who just started law school. Neither of us have ever owned a laptop so I was pretty clueless as to what to look for. This case looks very professional and it holds everything. He gets compliments on it all the time and one of his friends actually bought the exact same one for himself.
5,Good Introduction to Chinese,"There is an audio tape that goes with this book. It is sold separately and you should get it to help you with pronounciation.This is a very basic book and you can go through it relatively fast, without getting stuck along the way.Highy recommended for beginners.Some other program to help you with pronounciation of Chinese are Pimsleur's programs and to help you write Chinese characters - Easy Chinese Tutor CD."
3,Robbing Peter to pay Paul,"I have to say, Yong Ho is an excellent writer, and teacher. I loved all the cultural tidbits along the way. But he needs to get someone else to publish his book, because I had it maybe three days and the binding split. I'm extremely careful with by books. I try to keep them in perfect condition so that you can't tell they've ever been read. So I was extremely disappointed by that."
2,No pronunciation guide?,"Unless I have totally missed it somehow, there is no explanation in this book as to how the language is actually to be pronounced. Pinyin is used, to be sure, but no explanation of the Pinyin system is given. That seems like a pretty glaring ommission to me.The grammatical explanations are pretty good, so I didn't give the book only one star. I almost gave it three stars, but the author included several interludes in which he tries to teach you about a supposed connection between the Chinese language and the Chinese way of thinking and from a linguistic standpoint, alot of his ideas are questionable to say the least. Take that stuff with a grain of salt anyway, and for my part, I forwent the addition of a star to the book's rating.Final rating: 2 stars."
2,Not good enough without a teacher,This book wont help you to learn speak chinese at all if you dont have a teacher who can tell you how to pronounce the words.
2,Frustrated,Extremely annoyed to find after opening the package (since the wrapper was covering the cutters) that I've received two giraffes and no elephant. I'm making cookies for my son's birthday and elephants are his favorite. I'm am quite disappointed in this product.
3,"cute, too small",they are cute when you look at it but it seems to only work well with thin cookie and not so much else.
4,Mini is Right!,"These cookie cutters are perfect for what I wanted! I have a small (18 lb) pug with a sensitive stomach, so I'm going to try to make some homemade (healthy) cookies for him. I looked everywhere for a cookie cutter that wasn't the size of my dog's head, but everything seemed to be human or big dog size. I was looking for something that was more proportional to a little dog. I saw the ""mini"" cutters and I crossed my fingers. When they arrived tonight, I tried to think of a way to describe how small they are...the ark, for example - a nickel can fit inside, with a little extra on the sides. A dime fits inside the bear and a quarter inside the elephant. So they're definitely mini! The only reason I gave four stars is because I haven't used them yet to know how well they cut through dough. They were a smidge smaller than I expected, but I think they will work really well."
2,very very small,bought these for sandwiched for a party so tiny i can fit all 4 on one slice of bread. didnt work i couldnt use them. saving them for play doh or maybe cookies one day. but very tiny
3,Its ok..,"This move is... ok at best. The information given in it is nothing new, and the same that is in every book anyone buying this movie has ever read. Horrible acting and graphics, not that this is much of a deal in most SEAL movies but due to the lack of interesting information it begins to add up. Also, no actual US Navy SEALs are in this movie (or even helped make it, at least it seems that way)."
1,war time....snooze time,"I have 2 kids, both boys, ages 8 and 12. Both are fans of anything that has to do with war - battleships, battle gears, strategy and of course - engaging war movies. With movies, I veer them away from gory depictions and steer them closer to either well made commercial movies OR those shown in discovery or history channels.They are fascinated with navy seals so this was an easy pick. But boy, this is a really boring pick. The film is clearly low budget production, it's pitiful. Disappointing."
5,CAROLS FROM BUCKFAST,THE ARTICLE WAS PROMPTLY SENT. I HAVE CONTACTED THE SELLER.THE DVD IS JUST SUPER! I AM VERY PLEASED THANKSDAVE LANDSBERGEN
5,Safety for big kids,"I love this car seat. I want my child to be in a 5pt harness for as long as possible. I have taller than average children and love that this seat goes to 52"" for height. It is narrow to fit in to my rather compact car. There are other seats that will accomidate children to 53"" and 60lbs but for the money this one is top notch. The side pannels around the head are well cushioned and though not considered a safety feature are nice for falling asleep and peace of mind. When reaching for something in the back of our vehicle my husband broke one off. I emailed the company and they were AMAZING!!! They sent a replacement free of charge as fast as they could. The coustomer service at Safe Guard is top notch too. I would recomend this car seat to anyone!"
3,Great book!,"Here is a man who lived a long time and experienced many traumas and victories. The leader and first prime minister of Israel, Ben-Gurion was an international legend."
4,"great show, not so great quality","I remember religiously watching Joe Schmo 1 and 2 weekly on SpikeTV. I bought the first DVD set as soon as it came out as I have this one. I give the show 5 stars, I also love how they included the 90 minute episode that was advertised to air but was cut down to a hour. My only complaint is the quality of the episodes aren't so great. I would compare it to watching a Vhs tape of the show recorded on the fastest speed. Actually that may look better than what we have here because there's a lot of digital artifacts and distortion such as a green halo around the skin of anyone in the lightest shadow.Show: 5 starsQuality: 2 starsOverall: 4 stars seems fair right? ok maybe not but I love this show and glad to have it all together on dvd."
4,"The show content itself is great, but the packaging & recording were meh...","Prior to making the purchase, I figured that the quality of the video and sound was going to be sub-par, and I was correct. Luckily, this show is dialogue-driven and doesn't need all of the super duper sounds and picture that the average movie requires. Having seen the show when it first aired, I knew what I was getting and even with the cases plus two sleeves and two discs and shoddy sound, it was still totally worth it to me. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to any fan of any of the Joe Schmo shows."
1,Joe Schmo 1 was funny. Joe Schmo 2 is only Shmo Shmo,"I liked Joe Schmo 1 when it first came out on TV. I hadn't seen Joe Schmo 2, so I thought I would order it for some light comedy.Joe Schmo 2 was not nearly as funny as the original. Season 2 relies too heavily on raunchy situations rather than character interaction as the main vehicle to try to get a cheap laugh.The DVD set was delivered quickly and had no defects so the seller's performance was good - but I just didn't like the content."
3,1 vs. 2 is same as comparing movies to their sequals.,"This show has such a great concept. Regualar people thrown on a fake TV show with fake people, and everyone know but them. This season however was not even close to the first.I really don't understand all the people comparing this season to season 1. There really is no comparison. Season 1 was FAR superior to season 2. I'm pretty sure if you're looking to buy this one you've seen season 1 though, so you'd still want it, maybe to finish your collection or just because you haven't seen it, but again, not even close to season 1."
2,What's wrong with the quality?,"The quality of the audio and video of this set is totally unacceptable. There's a constant buzz in the background and the video is of far less quality than what they showed on Cable nearly 10 years ago. I'm not usually somebody who would comment on quality, either. I don't know 1080 from 720 or Blu Ray from VHS for the most part. Very disappointed. The show is great, though. Not as good as the first, but I'm happy to have seen it."
2,The slim batteries that I got form Amazon don't fit!!,"The PSP Slim Charger Wall Mount 2-In-1 doesn't fit well with the slim batteries that I bought from Amazon. It still charges and it works, but it clearly wasn't designed to go together."
1,P.O.S. PLEASE READ!!,This changer is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought it didn't work the first time I used it and it took a knife to pry my battery back out if it. I even tried modding the little P.O.S. and it still did not work. Buy the official Sony changer and you will be much better off. GARBAGE DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!
1,Mine is a bust,"Boxwave screen protectors have been my go to for 5 years on a sorts of devices, most recently 2 iPhone 4s. I have no idea what's going on with this one for the iPad. Normally I can start at an edge or corner and work to lay it down bubble free without much hassle. This one lays down gradually and creates more bubbles than I can count. Almost as if something is wrong with the backing (my screen is super clean). I can't get them out no a matter how slowly I'm working at it.Never seen this before but another reviewer seems to have the same issue. Maybe a bad batch or something but this one is completely unusable and unlike any of the other 8+ ones I've done before (all flawless or very close using exact same technique).Going to contact the company and see what they say. If this resolves I'll post back and update but I'd steer clear as I'm not the only one reporting this."
1,Unusable!,"It is literally IMPOSSIBLE to apply the screen protector without-1. Having hundreds of air bubbles which are impossible to get out2. Damaging the screen protector by using the ""application tool""Do NOT buy this product. On their site they offer a 30 day money back guarantee - that is, unless you actually try to USE it. Once the application backing is removed you can't return it. Don't waste your money"
2,Nashville sound yuck,"I should have guessed that this was the ""nashville sound""....horns,backup singers, etc. With little music from the artists. Sure enough...sweet orchestra wit strings, brass, singers, etc. If you're looking for good old country music as it should be seen and heard this ain't it.. Save your money! Sounds like lawrece Welk!"
2,Disappointment.,"I purchased this book because I needed a grammar workbook for an 8th grade student I'm tutoring. Looking at the title of the book, the table of contents, and the brief description about the book, I figured this book would have good practice questions. It does have quite a few practice questions, but they lack variety. For examples, under ""Noun"" section it only has ""Underline all nouns in the following sentences"" questions. No student is going to enjoy doing 80 questions in that format. It's supposed to be for grades 6-10, but I don't think this goes beyond 6th grade. Spend your money elsewhere and don't waste it on this book."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased these curtains (insert valance and swags) to replace ones I'd had in my kitchen for several years They were very wrinkled coming out of the package, so I washed them. Upon this first washing, many threads on the lace began to pull out and the header became twisted as if cut on the bias. After much spray starch and clipping of loose threads, I got them to look okay, so I kept them. They definitely did not meet the quality expectations of my first set of battenburg lace curtains."
5,I love the Battenburg lace curtains!,"I have the Battenburg lace curtains up in every room of my house, some ivory, some white and so of course these fit right in!"
1,Not what shown,The curtains we received were poor quality and did not match either the packaging or what is pictured. Unfortunately we had to pay shipping to send them back. We're very disappointed.
4,Battenburg swag curtain,"These are nice, but I thought the lace was crochet, not thin lace. They look nice at my kitchen window, so I decded to keep them.The shipping was fast!"
3,Interesting little film...,"As for the movie, the acting isn't god-aweful, the sets are interesting in a earlier than The Cube way, the killings are pretty run-of-the-mill and the bad guys are ok (the guy with the eye is pretty over-the-top, but my guess is he was told to act that way). You do get a glimpse as to the idea behind the cube and the powers-that-be that run it. You also get a few clarifiers to the original Cube.That written, it wasn't great and it wasn't horrible. I didn't find myself wanting to turn it off and I'll probably watch it again.Three stars"
3,ANYONE FOR ROCKY XXI?,"The people trapped inside of building having to escape by figuring out puzzles has become overdone. Frankly I am a bit burned out by it all, I stopped watching Saw movies at IV because it got so bad and so far from the original, although not as bad as Halloween 3, which had nothing to do with the first two movies other than the fact it was Halloween.What is different about this movie which made it tolerable to watch was that it concentrated on the technicians who were operating the cube rather than the blood and guts aspect of people getting killed in imaginative fashion, although it does have some of that.The bad guy with the fake eye was almost cartoonish. If you sat through the other two movies and liked them, you know you are going to watch this one anyway, so why are you reading the reviews?"
2,I need an ending,"Ok. If you like to have endings to your films and like some sort of logic in your films then this Cube isn't for you. If you like open-ended films and don't want to know why things work and how it ends, then it might be to your liking.This was better than Cube2. But that's not saying much. I agree with another poster that the scenes in the cube look more professional and the ones outside the cube look for Sci-fi Channel movie like. Which is bad.I also like to see the little guys win so that is another reason why I disliked Cube3 and Cube2. I can't remember Cube1.The special effects are decent. And that's the only good thing."
3,So much unrealized potential,"CUBE was pretty darn good. CUBE 2 was a lesser movie, but was faithful enough to the premise and allowed us a peek outside the cube at who or what might have been pulling the strings.CUBE ZERO offers us more outside-the-cube looks, but in a very unsatisfying way. And the character Jax, a disfigured middle-manager type who runs roughshod over the technicians monitoring and (in some case) manipulating activity in the cube, is played WAY too broadly and looks too damn silly to be effective.I wasn't a huge fan of CUBE 2 but I liked what the ending hinted at: a large corporate and military entity with unethical evil on their minds. CUBE ZERO tries to have some degree of ominousness to it, but it just doesn't play out well enough.If this is the direction the series is heading, they should stop now."
4,"Not as good as the 1st CUBE, but miles better than HYPERCUBE.","CUBE ZERO is a pretty good prequel to the 1997 original. I liked the way it explained the origins of the Cube device.Definitely see this, but watch the original first, or the ending wont make sense!Just dont bother with CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE."
1,do NOT waste your money!,"this is a STUPID movie! tho a lot of people may not have liked any of the other cube movies, this one is by far the worst of them all! i liked cube 2: hypercube and the first cube because it focused just on the people in the box. this cube zero has a different genre to it and completely isnt like those other 2 movies. instead of only focusing on the people in the rooms, they show people thats behind the whole deal and its just not the same as the other 2 movies. the music is stupid and sounds cheap and just completely doesnt give you the feel of the other cube movies. i wish i did not rent this crap. save your money and take my word on it, cube zero sucks! do not see it. i didnt even finish seeing the whole thing.. i had to stop it in the beginning part because the vibe of this movie is stupid from the beginning... whoever rated this movie more than 1 star is weird..over all, NOT a good movie like the other cube movies! do NOT rent or buy it!!"
4,"Cube vs. Cube Zero, torn between which is better!?!","Simply put: Cube focuses on ""unwillingly"" particpants/prisoners in a crazed game and Cube Zero zooms in on the makers of the same crazed game. What Cube Zero also offers, to those who missed out on the first Cube, is insight on the particpants/prisoners as they crawl thru this maze of deadly rooms. Although Cube was a thrill to watch, it does tend to get annoying as the characters begin to bicker and turn on each other. Cube Zero jumps from makers to participants preventing the characters from being worn out. You are also given the reason these people were put into these rooms where Cube just throws us into the maze and offers no explanation as to how and why these people have been imprisoned. In vain, that mystery is what makes Cube so intriquing. Both endings are breathtaking and make the whole first 80 mintutes completely worth watching."
3,Similar to Original Cube,This was very similar to the original Cube movie. If you liked the first one you will like this one also.
2,Big Fat Zero,"""Cube Zero"" mearly satisfied my curiousity about what existed outside the CUBE but still leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Perhaps ""CUBE 4"" will answer these questions...someday. Try renting it first."
3,"Not as good as the original, but still a fun movie. Imagery is good.","Not as good as the original, but still a fun movie. Imagery is good."
4,Cube Zero,"i just love these movies, i must admit i did love the bright fresh new idea when the first one came out, I hope there will be others, what I liked about it is that there is now answer really, but there are clues through the movie, I recommennd this movie if your into something strange ;) have fun"
2,same movie different title,i watched the original cube. This is just telling you what was done to get it all started. The charaters are almost Exact to the ones in the cube. Seem like the exact same move different title. id rent it first. They added one or two details but for the most part its the same.
4,Caroline's my favorite,"I love books about submissive girls and Beatrice is one of my favorites. But it is the character of Beatrice's sister whom I most enjoy. However both girls have delicious adventures, being forced (or at least gently coerced) to experience and submit to many things which had been forgotten during Beatrice's unhappy, and short lived marriageMy favorite scene is possibly the one in the stable where the girls are washed using a sponge. Magnificent"
3,Pet Shop Boys remembering the '80's,"This CD is a 2part CD compilation that Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant put together of their favorite songs from the '80'- none of the selections are their creation.Chris' selections are more upbeat and includes some that are danceable like Dirty Talk by Klein & MBO and Passion by The Flirts. Neil's selections include songs that are more toward serious classical music but if you expect them to be danceable, then, think again.I wish they will come out with a re-interpretation or remix of their favorites from other artists that are danceable. After all, the Pet Shop Boys will always be remembered as a fun dance group and not for their admiration of serious classical music.Most disappointing is that they did not use their great talent to create a continuous mix of their favorites. We hope that their next album will be what they are known to be."
3,Back to Mine review,"Both the albumns in this 2 cd Pet Shop Boys albumn are very good but quite diffferent than anything I have heard them do before. I was expecting something similar to their older music that would be fun to run and walk with, but this is more background and listening music."
2,Not Really A PSB Album,"This is a collection of songs that were chosen by PSB, not an original PSB release. (I hope that made sense)The collection is very nice, but not at all what I was expecting."
1,Incredibly Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is without doubt the worst album to come out so far this year. The Chris Lowe cd is listenable but the only thing really good on it is The Flirts Passion. The Neil Tennant cd is just boring. The mixing on both cds is that they just stuck the songs together, a really bad idea. And you think they would at least do a new song for it but no, they just use a bunch of people no one really knows. Overall, this is worse than Disco 2, which up til now has been there worst album. Do Not pay full price for this, wait until you can catch it used and cheap."
1,A Great Disappointment,"I bought this album in the hope that it would contain music composed or performed by the Pet Shop Boys. In fact, the album bears utterly no relationship to PSB music. The Boys owe their fans an apology and a refund."
1,Hype and sterility,"What Madonna and Neil Tennant Have in common is the money and power to pay others to do the job (i am ignoring the other Pet Shop Boy because God alone knows what he is good for). So no talent? Never mind, wave your cheque book and real musicians, top producers, ghost writers and collective sycophants will gather around and come up with goods.You can then float your tinny, thin little vocals and banal lyrics over their work. Afterwards you can go to the bank in your pick-up truck and load it with money. Meanwhile genuinely talented people scrabble to make a living. Ah me.'twas ever thus. To take this parasitical develpment to this logical conclusion they have here issued an album of other peoples songs , sung by....other people. Con-artists of the first degree."
4,great introduction to remixing,"Great buy if you're looking specifically at remixing. The book does not dive into specific programming techniques for synthesizers at a detail enough to become a professional, but it is short enough that it became a quick reference for me on certain techniques. Very good read for the aspiring producer."
1,Way too basic,Not much in this book you can't find on your own. He goes through too many topics in too few pages for this book to be useful. Things are covered at a conceptual level only leaving much to be desired; so either you'll read it and feel like you were not given enough (if you're new to music production) or read it and feel like you wasted time and money (if you have even a basic level of experience).
5,Daughter loves it,"I love the Svan chair...and now that I have the cushion, my 6 mth old is as happy as can be. The cushion is quite thick and cushions her well. I haven't washed the cushion yet, but hopefully it will be easily washable."
2,Out of Date material concerning Saturn,"Vicki Lenz has written a thoughtful, but out of date rendition of how Saturn currently conducts business. Because of lower sales numbers, many of the dealerships have reverted to the old way of selling cars. Long gone are the barbeques and the customer information seminars, proactive recalls, and friendly cost effective customer service. Policy now calls for ""touching the desk"", the typical car sales approach for the sales person to get the manager before the customer leaves the premises as a last ditch effort. Saturn is no longer rated as the number 1 car in sales satisfaction and the JD Powers ranking is sinking annually. Ms. Lenz needs to seriously update her material. The techniques she describes haven't been used by Saturn for quite awhile."
3,Nice unit but......,"This is my second alarm system with this company. Installation in my opinion requires some knowledge of vehicle wiring systems. Documentation could be be more detailed. The unit worked fine. The only downfall is the system remote. The buttons on the remote protrude above the surface, so when it is in your pocket, various buttons get pressed down accidentally. I would give this a 3+!"
5,"Hilarious, engrossing, amazing twists- best of Susan Isaacs","There is no one quite like Lee White. Although everyone finds a part of themselves in Lee White, Susan Isaacs incredibly realistic character. Witty, funny, intelligent reading. Recommended to anyone who enjoys really knowing the characters they read and being engrossed in their lives. Lee finds that perhaps the best way to make yourself happy is to be not quite perfect. Being, not the damsel in distress nor the perfect feminist model, Lee's wit and point- blank look at life make her character incredibly relatable. Isaacs leaves you feeling like looking back after a long trip, complete with u-turns and potholes, but glad you bought your ticket."
2,Ho hum,"This book moved really slowly at first. And the ending (in Lily's personal life) was really unbelievable. I would not recommend this book, it really slogs along and offers no sense of gratification at it's close."
2,I would not give it more than a 3...not up to par,I didnt think it was up to par..because it didnt hold my interrst..very slow in developing
4,"GREAT SONGS, GREAT LYRICS, BAD HAIR","COME OUT AND PLAY DELIVERS MORE FANTASTIC HEAVY METAL TUNES LIKE COME OUT AND PLAY, KING OF THE FOOLS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FIRE BURNS WHICH IS HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE MOST ROCKIN TUNES EVER RECORDED. UNLIKE THE PERFECT STAY HUNGRY COME OUT HAS A COUPLE OF DUDS WITHSTANDING THIS ALBUM IS A MUST BUY FOR TRUE HEAVY METAL FANS"
4,Sentimental Four Stars,"This disc takes me back to a fun time in my life, it's not the best Twisted Sister (Stay Hungry or You can't stop rock-n-roll), but it's a fun listen. And 'King of the fools' is a classic slow song."
4,A Sister with balls!,"From the opening blast of come out and play to the final strains of King of the Fools this is a non-stop blast of 80s metal at its best. The album is full of classics and is without doubt their finest hour with Snider's voice carrying the album to great heights. The only duff song (and what stopped me giving 5) is the cringe-worthy Alice Cooper duet Be Crool to Your Skool, a massive display of misjudgement on their part (great video though!) This is Sister's finest hour with their balls out for all to see. BUY IT!"
4,Some overshadow but great music,"Going in order by release date, I was surprised by this CD. There are less bad tracks on this CD, but they are still on here unfortunately. King of the Fools was a great track. Come out and play was good as well. Be cruel to your school was goofy but not bad enough to have their fans turn from them, which is what happened. Still worth buying. Highly recommended."
3,Come Out & Play,"There is so much a Twisted element to this CD that most TS fans will enjoy. Firstly it has some bump n' grind fast tunes like the title track,COME OUT AND PLAY & KILL or BE KILLED, another two that represent that TS anthem attitude, I BELIEVE IN ROCK n' ROLL & I'M LOOKING OUT FOR #1 and two light hearted gems in the way of 'Leader of The Pack' & the over the top school relic number featuring ALICE COOPER on vocals...the video is a RIOT !!on 'BE CHROOL TO YOUR SCUEL' but my fav track from this bunch is 'King Of Fools' that may perhaps rival 'The Price' as my fav TS ballad of all time.You want It....I GOT It ! Don't expect this one to sound like thier other Cd's. A must to have for True SMF's"
5,alternative fanatic,"I think that this album is totally awesome!!!!!!!!! I mean, this album has great music, lyrics and is great in general. the songs totally rock. i dont see what people see in all this 50 cent CRAP. its basically talking with a beat and some low backround music. it totally cant compare to the guitars, and all the other instruments that make up this album. i think that this album is totally a masterpiece. so, a long story short, BUY THIS INCREDIBLE ABLBUM if u havent already, and kno that u made a smart choice."
5,Strong album,"This is a strong album with enduring musical riffs. I only lament that Amazon's sale pricing today is for the ""explicit"" version. I'm not a prude, nor do I wish to censor artist license (I don't think Radiohead takes it ""too far""), but for the family iPod, I'm going to have to abstain this time. Bummer!"
4,Too bad they went 'too' alternative.,"The Bends was the album that introduced me to Radiohead. I do enjoy this album alot, don't play it as much as I prolly should but each time I play it I get into the music so much. They do really have great accoustic rock songs in here, like the famous 'High n Dry' and prolly fan's fav 'Fake Plastic Trees'. Too bad they couldn't keep it up altho they did made some awesome songs afterwards like my favorite from theirs 'Karma Police'.This is a 3 1/2 stars album. Not more nor less."
4,it's radiohead.:),"Ok, you can just ignore cranky reviewer's supposed review and buddy you don't deserve a best friend. lets just stick to the facts here, this is not stale punk rock, this is some real music. radiohead are real music, they create real, heartfelt albums. you can't diss on these guys, they are a true band. ignorance is not needed."
5,...MUST BUY...,"...Radiohead's follow-up to their pop-hit Pablo Honey is nothing less then classic. It is deep, musical, simply beautiful. I highly recommend this album and OK COMPUTER. Both these albums are just awesome and if you are just looking into Radiohead now, you have been missing out for a while...From beginning to end, Radiohead fuses emo and indie sounds to create this non-stop wall of wonderous sound. 'The Bends,' 'High and Dry', 'Fake Plastic Trees,' the list goes on.HIghly HIGHLY recommended..."
5,I listen to this one as much as OKC.,"In my listening experience, The Bends is everything as enjoyable as OK Computer is. Both are great rock albums, with everyone in the band really delivering quality music. Thom Yorke delivers clean cut, strong, yet unique vocals. It's consistent throughout the whole album, but really shines in Fake Plastic Trees. The guitarists deliver great riffs while not overdrowning the singing. Some of the most enjoyable electric guitar moments can be found in My Iron Lung and The Bends. It's one of those albums that you just never get tired of, because of great songwriting, great composing, and great playing. Deserves a five star. A must listen for any music fan."
5,Superior,"Superior listening experience. Not a collection of songs, each track is unique, but carries a common style throughout. Delicate melodies, inspiring choruses, performed with precision, not a wasted lyric or note. Pure production quality, the music sound unfiltered and live. The crescendos make this album stunning to me because they start from a basic melody, build in volume, power and complexity to a point where you think it could go further. Yet continue to go bigger, and suddenly drop off, back to the beginning to a pause, then ramp up again. The range of emotions in the vocals and lyrics: pain, sarcasm, anger, fear, and love. It's all there, and oddly I hear it in each song. Clearly a masterful performance."
5,it was great,great and fast (duh online mp3!) ;D well you should listen to it yourself to find out if you like the album! so buy it
5,who are your real friends?,the first time i heard My Iron Lung i went into a trance...this entire album is compelling amazing heartbreaking...
5,Just a little under the #1 ranking of OK COMPUTER,"At least for me. I bought this album in May, 1998 and fell in love with it. PLANET TELEX, TEH BENDS, HIGH AND DRY...Man, it doesn't get better than this! JUST is my favorite song on this album, and possibly out of all of them. I like all the songs, even FAKE PLASTIC TREES, which had to grow a bit on me. This album, like OK COMPUTER, is pure genius. It's simple rock, sort of, but it just sounds so great."
5,Radiohead 101,"I've always been kind of afraid of Radiohead's music just from listening to reviews and comments about them. Well a few weeks ago I was going through some really emotional stuff in my life and my best friend handed me this cd...I figured I wouldn't like it but trusted his taste. WELL-long boring story short...this cd could not have come at a better time. I have been listening to it non-stop for weeks and am now a big Radiohead fan. Each song tells a story that you can relate to--it's great for those depressing days but also amazingly great any other time. Thom's vocals, his songwriting, the production...all is brilliant. If you're looking for a starter RADIOHEAD CD...this is it. It'll help, I promise :-)"
5,The Bends..........album of the 90's???,"'The Bends' stands alone in comparison to the prestigious rock album's of the 1990's. The whole album has a strong punch in getting the attention span of the most basic of music gurus. From the psychedelic space-like opening to the genius of the last track (Fade Out....), it surprises with nearly every beat. The title track begins in pure rock form and explodes with vocals, and then a nearly rap-like middle that returns to rock anthemism. The softer tunes don't 'sap it up' and the darkest tune, ""Bulletproof"" is a hidden gem along with ""Black Star"".Though lost in the success of their hit song ""Creep"" from their 1st album 'Pablo Honey', Radiohead's 2nd album has EVERYTHING a rock and roll fan can ask for. 'The Bends' never lets up and provided the momentum that has exploded into superstardom as the band headed into the new millenium. They are quite possibly the most creative band in music."
3,Is giving this 3 stars the equivalent of kicking a puppy?,"Just glancing on a rating website and seeing an average of 4.11 made me think about ""The Bends"". I like it yes, but I have never loved it. And I don't feel the need to love it.Maybe here's why - I was never one to get into this album when it first arrived, and that seems criminal. Friends who are fans of this always talk of the nostalgia it creates, how they reminisce about their great discovery of Radiohead. They talk about how this album changed and shaped their understanding of music. It was their first maturing turning point in musical appreciation. Well, excellent. But I wasn't there, and didn't care for Radiohead as a youth. Yes, there are some standout memorable tracks here, but too much of it strikes me as standard and predictable. Ultimately it's guitar rock that sometimes hits the spot, but just as often drifts by."
5,Best Radiohead CD,"I really like Radiohead and I owned OK Computer and wanted to buy another Radiohead CD and I saw the great reviews this CD got but I was skeptical not having heard of any songs prior to my purchase. But I was pleasantly surprised to how great this CD is. I absolutley love it, even more than OK Computer. Every song is great, nothing to skip over. If you like coldplay or radiohead and you dont own this I higly recommend it. Has a great mellow sound, I love his voice, just overall perfect."
5,Radiohead's Best album for Sure,This is their best album. Sure OK COMPUTER probebly generated more buzz but this is where they reinvented anthemic rock.
5,All Time Greatest rock albums of the 1990's,"released in 1995. The Bends became one of the most dearing, ambitious and interesting albums of the decade and earned Radiohead huge applaud from critics and music fans world-wide.The compositions are amazing, lyrically it's flawless. The perform the music so well, the production is top notch.It still sounds fresh today as it did 8 years ago and every song on it is flawless. It's Radiohead most strongest yet most accesible album.It's heavy, it's fun, sad, poetic , unique and beautiful.An All time great album that everybody needs to have in their record collection."
5,Brilliant,Just wanted to see even tho the Bends is from years ago this is by far still one of the best cd's ever made! It's still in my car. Its breathtaking-------- I cant get enough of it!
4,Essential,"Very good album by Radiohead, although i can't say i hold it in the same regard as some people. This is easily their most accessible album and much stronger than Pablo honey. Songs such as ""fake plastic trees"", ""Just"", ""Bullet proof...i wish i was"" and the title track are why so many people have fallen in love with this band. Not quite as perfect as their follow up Ok Computer, but The Bends is still an essential 90s rock album."
5,There aren't enough stars on this review to rate it justly.,"It's testament to the collective genius of Radiohead that with The Bends, along with OK Computer, they could pen what are probably two of the greatest albums of all time. It's truly spectacular. There is not a flawed song on this album. For anyone who owns OK Computer and not this, the album is just as good. In fact, it's hard to pick a better CD between them. I urge you, buy this album now, before it's too late, and savour one of the true masterpieces of probably the greatest band doing the rounds today."
5,Can't stop listening,"From start to finish this album puts me in some sort of blissful trance. Everyone I've convinced to listen to it has thought it's incredible (except perhaps my mother, but what did I expect). Thom just sings how and what I'd sing if It'd been me, the music spirals and twists just like it would if I was playing it, and if I could make an album it'd sound exactly like this. Particularly strong songs are Fake Plastic Trees, Just (which incidentally may have the greatest music video ever made), My Iron Lung, Bulletproof ... I wish I was, Bones and of course fade out/ street spirit (arpeggiated Am, C, Em with a descending D C B on the B string for any other budding guitarists). Radiohead can blend spontaneity and structure like no other band I've heard and that's what makes them so unique, brilliant and endlessly listenable. Far, far superior to Pablo, and closer to the heart than OK Computer, it's all good."
2,Gave me the Bends,I got the bends listening to this album and had to spend a few hours in a sound less chamber in order to return to normal society.
2,Patience is a virtue,"I tried, I really tried. Played it while I'm cooking, while I'm driving, just about any chance that I can have. I just don't get it. It does not grow on you. It just remains so boring. Makes me feel like my day has been so long. Nothing amazing here. Amazzzzzzzzzzing if you can stand 3-4 songs in a row. I salute anybody who can do that."
1,My ears now have the bends.,"Somebody once asked Ringo Starr what he did with the money his mother gave him for singing lessons. He replied ""I spent it on fish and chips."" He was joking. If the same reply had come out of Thom Yorke's mouth I would have totally believed him. His voice annoyed me. I like something different as much as the next person but PLEASE! One good song, High and Dry, the rest was difficult to digest in an aural sense. For those who do like this band, I am happy you are able to find music that you are so passionate about. Difficult to do now a days."
4,while not as 'amazing' as Kid A and OKC....,"the bends is a great radiohead album. if you want to check out radiohead before they become experimental with OKC, check out the bends. people say the bends has some of the best rock songs from radiohead. and also mellow songs such as [nice dream], bulletproof, and street spirit. the only song i dont like is 'sulk'. the ONLY reason i gave this only four stars is that it just doesn't have the amazing creativity and experimental like OKC and Kid A. if you are just getting into radiohead, get The bends first!!! and you'll love it, but soon after you buy their later albums... you may stop listening to it."
5,An essential album,"This album is a perfectly crafted piece of art. OK Computer is only slightly less perfect in my mind because of ""Fitter, Happier"". This album runs perfectly from beginning to end and it isn't an album which'll make you skip tracks. I would compare this album to The Joshua Tree by U2. The hits off this album are also wonderful. ""High and Dry"", ""Fake Plastic Trees"", ""Just (You Do It To Yourself"", and ""Street Spirit (fade.out)"" are all fantastic singles and one of those songs alone makes this album worth owning. But together those songs and the other songs make this an essential album."
5,big surprise,"I bought this on the reviews of others and am really glad I did. Whenever I buy a cd I am always somewhat disappointed with it and need time to get into the sound, but not with this one. I was hooked 2 minutes into it, then played the whole thing three times. This is one cool cd."
5,Good stuff,"This is tied with OK Computer as my favorite Radiohead album. Planet Telex is my hands down favorite song (I love the bass line and the lyrics), while Street Spirit is a close second (dark and deliciously ominous)."
3,"Pretty good, but its no Ok Computer!","Yeah I like it,but its a bit studenty is'nt it? The singles are great (well apart from 'High and Dry')but some of the other tunes are greatly exaggerated.Ok Computer is transitional, being the future of music without being Dance.Buy that first,but don't ignore The Bends,you'll probably like it.Oh well.I don't like students very much."
3,Some beautiful tunes from early Radiohead,"After the chaos ensued after the release of ""Creep"", Radiohead had to show that they were more than just a slacker one hit wonder band. This is not my favorite Radiohead album, but there are wonderful songs on this album. Although its a very sad and depressing song, ""Street Spirit"" is an incredibly flawless song. As well as the singles ""High and Dry"", ""Just"", and ""Fake Plastic Trees"", this album is definitely a knock out!"
5,The Bends,"I love this album!!! This is like a before there made it big original rock cd. Just a perfect example on where they came from and where they were headed. This is a intense album full of feeling. It really get's the feeling they want out there the best part about it is that almost every song on the cd has a different emotion but unlike other mismatched cds from other bands, The Bends totally flows together. Amazing"
5,A 5 Star CD,"I thought I had taste in music, which I obviously couldn't prove until now, with The Bends. The CD is a masterpiece, which not even Radiohead have been able to replicate since. This music will not appeal to people who enjoy loud rock music or Tool, but for those who enjoy good song-writing and originality."
4,great album; poor pressing,"five-star album; fewer-star pressing.this album is perhaps the best introduction to radiohead for the uninitiated, but what's the deal with capitol's reissue having label-placement issues? i purchased two copies of this LP and on both copies the label on side two is placed such that i have to be poised and ready to lift the needle after street spirit fades out so that it doesn't get sucked onto the paper label making an AWFUL noise and clearly damaging my needle. my new, reissued copy of Kid A has a similar problem (end of side 2 and 4 make awful noise, but don't get sucked all the way on to the paper label). what's the point of going through the trouble of reissuing such an incredible album without seeing the quality-control through to the very end? this item would have most definitely received a five-star rating were it not for this problem."
1,"Keep whining little boy, keep whining.","May all your mindless fans worship your great talent of whining. Yea use that beautiful vocal of yours. lol, NOT!"
1,Garbage,Radiohead are garbage. I never liked them. The lead singer is really ugly and you can't even dance to this music. Buy something from Jimi Hendrix or Bruce Springsteen instead.
1,What the Hell is a RadioHead?,"First, what does Radiohead mean? They're a moderized version of u2..nothing more...nothing less."
4,"8 years, it's still quite good!","After the bad 1st impression we got on Pablo Honey, Radiohead started anew with one of the best albums of 1995. This is the beginning of the sound that Radiohead is known for. There are mostly guitars on this, but here they just started experimenting with electronics. Planet Telex is a good example. It could be mistaken for Bjork. That is, until you hear Thom's whiny yet also beatiful voice. The best songs are High and Dry, a very catchy alternative song, Fake Plastic Trees, their most known single, Nice Dream, a very moody song with a killer guitar break, Just, a very good rock song, and Street Spirit, the sad ender.So, why 4 stars? 3 songs bother me. Bulletproof is out of place. We don't need another acoustic song. There's about 5 on the album. Black Star is too early 90's R.E.M to me (I never liked them), and I never got into Sulk. But it's still a fine album, and a great starting point."
3,I'm A Huge Radiohead Fan,"What really gets me about this album is how good it could have been. The Bends has some tracks that are among Radiohead's worst (""High & Dry,"" ""Black Star,"" and ""Sulk""). And the lesser known tarcks from Bends era singles/EPs were amazing. There was ""You Never Wash Up After Yourself,"" ""Maquiladora,"" ""Talk Show Host,"" ""Molasses!,"" and ""How Can You Be Sure?,"" among others.If those songs were included, I would have half a mind to give the album five stars despite the not-so-hot tracks. Unfortunately for us all, they weren't."
5,they weren't listening...,"Regarding the review from Evanston, IL: obviously they weren't listening to the music. The Bends is one of the most ambitious albums of the '90's and will rightly take it's place as one of the landmark albums since Meat is Murder."
3,"a warm-up for ""ok computer""","This album is very mixed. There are about 5 really good songs here (""Planet Telex"", ""The Bends"", ""Just"" (which I consider their second-best song, after ""Paranoid Android""), ""My Iron Lung"", and ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"". The rest of it, however, is basically filler--not necessarily bad, but all very similar, and not as inventive as the equivalent songs on _OK Computer_. Indeed, that album took all the good parts of this one and (almost) none of the bad, squeezing more variety out of the stereotype of the Radiohead song than you could ever guess from listening to such relatively uninspired tracks as ""High and Dry"" or ""Sulk"". If you were impressed by the experimentation of _OK Computer_, as I was, _The Bends_ may be a little too much like 'alternative rock' for your tastes, even if there are some excellent songs on it."
5,so close,"""the bends"" is brilliant. loud unusual grunting guitars coupled with incredible lyrics conveyed through a soulful, passionate voice. thom yorke and johnny greenwood make radiohead a great band. both play off each other and compliment each other beautifully. yorke's intelligent, superb lyrics and fantastic voice. greenwoods volatile, inventive guitars. sheer magic. less inventive than the slightly better ""ok computer"", this album is an instant favourite once heard by the listener. ""high and dry"", ""just"" and ""fake plastic trees"" ensure that. yet it could hardly be pigeon holed as run of the mill, right down the line rock and roll. its got some beautiful fragile songs that often burst into dramatic finishes (""fake plastic trees"", ""sulk"", ""nice dream""). it oozes class from start to finish and it is hard to fault this wonderful composition."
5,Classic Album,"Radiohead's 2nd album, The Bends, is more guitar-friendly than OK Computer or Kid A. It also has some of their greatest songs. Fake Plastic Trees and High and Dry are the most well-known. However, My Iron Lung, Planet Telex, and The Bends are other solid songs. The entire album is solid -- one that can be listened to without skipping a single track. It just amazes me how this group can put out a great album like this and then follow it up with an even greater release in OK Computer. Not as innovative as OK Computer, The Bends is still a highly-recommended album and one that will stand the test of time. It is not an exaggeration to say that the top 2 albums of the '90's are OK Computer and The Bends."
5,SIMPLY BREATHTAKING!,"This has to be the album of the 90s no question, it is absouletly brilliant. If you only ever buy one album make this your first choice, you won't me dissappointed. Every song is just awsome, never have I bought an album and loved every song, on this one I did! I especially loved ""High and Dry"" and ""Fake Plastic Trees"", but the whole album is just excellent...Go and buy it, one of the best (if not best) albums ever created..."
5,Radiohead at their Finest,"This classic Radiohead album is a must have for anyone who loves music!Starting out with the opening sounds of ""Planet Telex,"" Radiohead takes you on a musical adventure to a pure rock oasis. This pre-OK Computer is an amazing jump, IMO, from their debut album Pablo Honey.I started out actually listening to Radiohead (not counting hearing their name sporadically when I was a kid, pre-teen) with HTTT, and it took me a second to get used to this album, but I'm listening to it right now, and it just blows my mind away!Please, if you love music in the least, try this album out! You won't regret it."
5,A Must Have CD From The Nineties,"Radiohead secured themselves as a permanent member of popular, yet very original Rock Band when they released this album. This album has a unique feel to it, and its nearly impossible not to enjoy all of the songs."
5,A TRULY MAGNIFICENT ALBUM,"Radiohead is clearly one of the finest bands playing today and an integral part of the British invasion. ""The Bends"" is a unique mix of raging guitars and powerful ballads as well as sweet disaster and heartbreak. ""Planet Telex"", ""The Bends"" and ""My Iron Lung"" are rip-roaring monster rock and beautiful melodies ""High and Dry"" and ""Fake Plastic Trees"" turn the album into ice cream from the ears. Thom Yorke's vocie is laced with rage and honey and his vocals are stunning. ""The Bends"" is Radiohead's second best album behind the sprawling, fantastic ""OK Computer"". Both are easily two of the very best albums of the 90's and Radiohead are easily the best British band today. Forget Oasis and Blur! BUY THIS CD!!!!"
5,radiohead/ 5 star CD,"I put on this cd and it transports me to another world. These songs are great, I don't think there is a bad one in the batch. I like ""You Do It To Yourself."" Wow! What a song. The opening song ""Planet Telev"" rocks out and is swirly and strange. The song ""My Iron Lung"" is just brilliant. We play that one a lot. Put this CD on and transport yourself to another universe. Completetly!!!"
5,Very Rare,"There are very few bands that cause me to become passionate. U2 did it with BOY (and October and War...Things started going wrong about there!) Radiohead did it initailly with OK Computer although ironically it was Street Spirit playing on MTV that first got my interest up (Neat Video). Originally the album cover put me off, pathetic excuse for saving money I know but OK C really got me started and the Bends now rates BEYOND OK in preference. There is something timeless in this album. Not some of the ""hits"" (That's a matter of perception) of OK but some more consistant passion, less ecclectic, more pure R&R. That's all. Just a truly great album I will still have in 20 years. Thank you Lord for the long life of CD's!"
5,transcendent,"Some music lifts itself above the fray, yielding far more than the average recording. The ingredients of such creations vary and are difficult to quantify or to describe. People get degrees in humanities and write theses about these records. The Bends is in that category with not many others. It is certainly separate from any other popular issue of its era, and is one of the inestimable Radiohead's best, rawest, yet most easily palatable CDs."
4,radiohead rocker,"To me this is Radiohead's more just rockin' album. It is more pop radio-friendly to me. Which doesnt mean anything except that while I am thinking about it and not listening to it I think of it as simply an album full of popish-hooks. But when you do listen and get the whole album experience you realize that calling it a rock album with nice hooks is way-off. They evolved very nicley with this album from Pablo Honey (their first album). What sets this album apart from other pop-rock is that it has a really great feel to it. The songs are intense for a good example, ""Street Spirit (fade out)."" Its not like the normal deep feeling you get from great artists, its like a great new kind of rock feeling that just makes your mind numb. Its some kind of new feeling and man it wakes you up from your popular rock bore. At least it did for me. If you like Pablo Honey than you will love this album with no problems. Its great to hear how this is their bridge to their OK Computer style."
2,how did they ever get signed!!!!,"im sorry but this album is horrible!!my first and lasst listen tossed it out on I495 expressway!! musically they are ok but they cant sing and the songs are lame! dont waste your time they sound like they want to take a nap!! thats my opinion, sorry"
1,I would like to hear the music before I review it.,I think it would be a good idea if you added a link to your web page that would allow people to hear the cd before they review it. Just a thought.
4,The Bends,"Great CD. The case was broken but the real bummer is that it's too ""used"" to play in some cd players."
5,A simply brilliant ceation,"I do not know which is better, this or OK computer. It doesnt matter though. It is brilliant. Hear Street Spirit or High and Dry to get the best of it."
5,My favourite Radiohead album,"The Bends was basically the beginning of Radiohead's genius (Pablo Honey was pretty good though). That being said, I enjoy it the most out of all Radiohead albums, which means a lot. To me, there are absolutely no weak tracks, and the albums flows very well. As opposed to OK Computer, there are times when the guys rock out, but there are still the quiet, impressive growers. If you're looking for an introduction to Radiohead, this is not it (OK Computer is the best album for starting out). However, this is a brilliant piece of music that should not be overlooked. My favourites include: Nice Dream, My Iron Lung, Just, Bullet Proof, and Planet Telex.Also recommended is the My Iron Lung EP, which holds 6 precious Bends-era b-sides. It helps to bridge the huge musical gap between Pablo Honey and The Bends."
2,False Advertising,"This reality show was a landmark TV show.It had never been done before--following a family, warts and all, with TV cameras.It had recently been shown on PBS--I missed it.Was thrilled to see it in a DVD.BUT BUT no where on the order page did it say that this was a summary of the show.IT IS NOT THE WHOLE SERIES. The whole series ran about 20 hours --this runs two.Buyer beware."
3,a dissapointment,I remember when this was on in the 70's- why not release the whole thing instead of two heavily edited hours???
1,Arrived damaged; very poorly packaged,"This item was a huge disappointment. First of all, it arrived in flimsy packaging which had been completely beat up and had holes in it when it arrived. We should have returned it immediately but our grandson was so anxious to get it and try it out that we went ahead and opened it, thinking that it would be salvageable. It wasn't. Where there was a hole in the package the airplane also had a gouge in it. The airplane itself is made out of very lightweight styrofoam, not the dense kind we were expecting. It was also cracked in another area due to the packaging getting so beat up on its way to our home. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It was a waste of money."
3,Good for children....!,"This glider may be fine for children, but I noticed it did not perform as well as my previous foam glider (which was larger than this one). I tried adding some weight to the nose section to get it to fly faster and farther, but nothing seemed to work. So I will save it for my grandchildren to play with when they visit me again, and keep looking for a glider that will stay in the air for at least 50 feet when tossed in one direction!"
4,Great Foam Glider,This product was a hit with my 5 year old grandsons. They managed to break it many times but masking tape and toothpicks held it together. After a week of constant use one plane was delegated as spare parts and the other flew on.
1,Matrix Amplify,This product arrived totally rock solid frozen! I am using it as I was completely out of it. It is very watery. I won't be purchasing it again.
5,Whew...Finally the Wait is Over,Love doesn't even begin to describe my feelings for this show. I'm just wondering how many times I can watch it before the first two seasons wear out:). I am so hyped that they have finally released Seasons One and Two on DVD as I have purchased both and love them both. I'm eagerly awaiting the remaining seasons. Although I must admit my favorite seasons are the ones that have both the Sugarbaker women in them.I guess I have to do another review for Season One. Maybe I can just copy paste this one.My favorite episode of Season Two is the one where she sees How Great Thou Art. It meant even more to me when she told us from the special episode of Season Two where they are all reunited it was the last time her mother got to see her sing before she died. Her baby girl..singing such a beautiful song in front of the world. Wow..how proud she must have been.
2,Designing Women 2nd Season,"I bought several seasons on Designing Women and at least one disk in each of the boxed sets had issues, either it would skip or some of the episodes wouldn't play at all. Since we purchased multiple seasons, it took time before we realized that this issue was pervasive throughout all of the boxed sets. Severely disappointing as this was a gift."
2,Designing Women season two,"There is a buzzing noise throughout the first few episodes. If I hear it in all the episodes and discs, I will return it."
5,Designing women,"I love the show and am enjoying watching it again. Only problem is the second season DVDs were full of something sticky, I was able to clean the discs do we could watch them. I didn't expect to have to clean new DVDs from the manufacturer."
3,"Love the show, DVDs less than quality shape","The DVDs arrived with ""gunk"" on the back. They paused for long periods of time. I had to clean them with alcohol and that worked - a trick I learned AFTER I requested a return label. They are fine now and easy (and enjoyable) to watch."
1,Designing Women: The Complete Second Season,When I opened this DVD there were 2 Disc 1's and 2 Disc 2's and in both cases disc 2 was defective and would not play. It looked like there was glue or something on the play side of the Discs. Discs 3 and 4 were missing. The Second Season appeared to be factory sealed when I received it.
1,Second Season Designing Women DVD set covered in murky film,"I've just returned the SECOND DVD sed for Designing Women, Second Season because the DVDs were covered with a film. Hopefully, the third time will be the charm. I'm sure that when I received a set that doesn't have film all over it, I'll enjoy the shows."
2,Poor quality,"I bought these slippers for my wife. She wore them around the house for a couple months and the heels wore out, shredded. The inner padding was showing. Our house is all carpet except for the kitchen, which is linoleum. There's no way these slippers should have worn so badly in such a short time. FootSmart would not exchange them since it was past the 60-day exchange period."
3,too tight,I bought these slippers in other colors from another web site and they were perfect. These are the same size but feel a little tight. I can't wear them with socks only with nylon knee highs.
3,Prolix obscures genius,"A well organized anthology of essays on a genius polyglot's philosophical foci. No doubt of Berlin's erudition. Trouble his writing style can be unpenetrable and wordy. I found myself rereading many times passages and still being baffled as to meaning. There are nuggets of wisdom, deep wisdom and practical lessons for conducting an ethical and examined life. But it is a task and requires much prior knowledge of other philosophers' ideasa"
1,nightlife,i didn't really enjoy reading this book i just couldn't pick up the story line which is a first for me cause i do alot of reading but not to
1,utterly biased and misleading,"this is one of the most biased, misleading books I have ever read. it reports all of the bad things that the south and the americans did, but totally ignores the atrocities committed by the north, like the 10,000 civilians killed in Hue during the 1968 VC offensive, including many who were buried alive. if the author is truly a pacifist, why are these not mentioned?beyond that, it tends to be repetitive and self-congradulatory."
1,"Terrible, it lasted 2 weeks!","I bought this cable and the connector broke 2 weeks after I bought it when I connected it to my Treo, I was even worried that it had damaged my Treo!Spend 3 more dollars and get a good one."
2,disappointing,This album was the genre I was looking for but the music fell far below my expectations. It was just another group trying to make apolitical statement with out any responsibility.
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"Well there's not much to sisal rope. It either holds up or fails. I purchased this sisal rope to repair a cat tree and it is the perfect thickness and length for my needs. As an added bonus, the cats LOVE to scratch it instead of the furniture and it is holding up to their sharp claws. This stuff is a win win for everyone, the cats can scratch all they want, the furniture is spared and we all are much happier.So if you need to repair a cat tree or make a scratch post, use this product."
4,Easy to use and moderately effective.,"I had some crash/freeze issues with Norton, so I switched to McAfee. VirusScan and Firewall are really the most useful and seems moderately powerful in par with PCCillin or Norton. I have 1GB ram so have no problem running the programs in the background. Less buggy than last year's McAfee VS, and works well on both my laptop and desktop. Better to buy the VirusScan/Firewall 2-pack.Pros:Easy to configureIntuitive menusFairly effective firewallOK SpamkillerCons:Expensive (comparitively)Privacy Controls buggyBad customer support options"
2,Slows down the computer!,"This is horrible! It slows my computer down to a crawl. Not recommended, except to perhaps do a stand alone virus scan."
1,The worst software in the world - ever!,"Says it all. If you have a standard XP pc you will be lucky to get this software installed. Four hours later, we resolved most problems but cannot get the Privacy Service to install. McAfee do not own up to this common problem and the Web is short on resolution advice too."
2,Spamkiller and support are the weak link,"McAfee has been a good product over the years for anit-virus protection. However, the Spamkiller product does not measure up to their usual high standard. It is full of bugs and and should have been tested more before it was released. My experience with chat support on two different calls about different issues was a complete waste of time."
5,Tight,"this is off the hook. the best track is called ""HATE"" it's so tight. get this hot joint and represent hoo-bangin' for life."
3,Cold and Futuristic,"I have to also confess that I picked this CD up on the strong recommendation of a friend and it's the only Haujobb CD I own. I did have a bit of a tough first couple of listens, but after that, it really grew on me. Really, really grew on me. Tracks like 'Journey Ahead', 'Depths', 'Distance', 'Deviation' and 'Nature's Interface' were heard in my apartment and my car over and over and over and over again. And maybe that's what did it. Or maybe it is overly surgical, mechanically cold sonic structures found on this disc. Or maybe I just got bored with it. But for whatever reason, I haven't been able to listen to this disc at all. And maybe, that's left a bad taste in my mouth. And maybe this disc really is better than three stars..."
5,Accellerationism,"This album is for the futurists of futurists (AKA Accellerationists)... as digital and analogue as music can get, and still retains that human feel with pianos, saxophones, offbeat drum'n'bass, very ""brave new world"" lyrics. Every song seems to be a ridulously true statement about humans relationship with technology... phrases like ""virtual masturbation"", ""no stationary living spaces, no static structures, mobility junkies"", ""jacked on the wire to a thousand billion degrees."" Reminds me very much of a soundtrack to 5th Element or something. haujobb create magical music"
3,opera?,"The Liverpool Oratorio was McCartney's first full-blown foray into classical music since The Family Way in the 60s. Once you get past 30 years of pop music and realize what you are listening to, it isn't that bad. Eventually you even start pickup up on the pop sensabilities of Paul McCartney within the conservative confines of classical music.Having said all that, this single is just two cuts from the Oratorio. No unique material here. Unless you are a die-hard completionist, spend your few cents getting a used copy of the whole thing.Nice songs though."
5,A Fantastic Introduction,"I do very highly recommend this book. It is enjoyable to read - considerably moreso than other books of it's kind. From this book you will get a very good background in the field. I believe this book serves much better for background information than to give you a set of techniques... if you want to learn techniques --- DO IT AT A SEMINAR --- nevertheless it is very useful to learn them ahead of time.This book is a good precursor to The Structure of Magic and Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. both by Richard Bandler and John Grinder -- which go much more indepth into the linguistic portions of the NLP model."
4,Proper intoduction in NLP,"NLP- three letters with plenty of meanings. Put together hypnosis, subconscious influence, association, anchoring, extending submodellities, intern and extern conscience. And all combined with self help, effective living instructions, business applications...This book is introduction in all fields covered by NLP. Interesting, intriguing and demystified in the sense of authors giving up the magic Milton Ericcson once induced for the goal of effectively presenting all NLP layers.Take it, read it, find your favourite NLP field!"
2,Not very good actually,"The book presents a few ideas and techniques from the field of psychology (ie critical thinking) but , because its an introduction, does not go into any real depth. It leave the reader feeling a bit cheated really. Anyone who's really serious can get more knowledge by picking up a few college level text books in psychology and skip this introduction."
5,"Yea, it's like that!","This tape hit a chord with me. If you are ready to accept that problems are half your fault and you really do want to stay with your partner, this tape might hit a chord with you too. She gives lots of techniques and approaches that are sensible, to me anyway. The examples of couples she uses to exemplify problems (wow that sounds just like so-in-so) and possible solutions are wonderful. It's only 4 tapes and the quality is pretty good. Even 1 partner can get some very useful tips about trigger points (approaches on how to uncover these hidden bombs), relationship levels (which I had never heard of before). Too bad it isn't a cd (why I was looking here). Some people don't have tape players in their cars. Hope this helps!"
4,Ambient Bliss,"Its great to see that Beltran has gone back to his more melodic roots. I love everything he's done, but this is a little piece of genius. Its the soundtrack to a hazy day, sometimes a little sad and dark, but the sun is always just about to come out behind the clouds. Good Job Mr. Beltran."
4,Some old fashioned values,I purchased this book because of the author Harold Bell Wright. He wrote some of this book while staying at the Mission Inn Hotel in Riverside CA.in 1919. I found it very interesting and enjoyed it since i am a docent at the Mission Inn .
3,Impossible task?,"I guess you acquire samplings like this to get some sort of overview. In most of the 'best ofs' I've heard & reviewed, despite the difficulty of reducing the choice of tracks from prolific artists, this has been achieved, even at the cost of 'rupturing' the contexts from which the tracks have been drawn. They manage to reweave an aesthetic tapestry. Not so with this, I feel. It's just too eclectic, a likely result of how varied the maps are that Cooder has covered. It isn't that this is a poor sampling. Just that I prefer so many of the complete originals; Boomer's Story, Paradise & Lunch, Purple Valley, and no compilation that pulls a single track from them can reflect their emotive hold."
1,Falls apart,"Although it fits the Ryobi, the bolt isn't secured to the knob, so the assembly falls apart as you try to install it. I recommend trying another vendor."
5,Christmas Choir,"This is an outstanding compilation of traditional Christams music. ""O, Little Town of Bethlehem"" and ""Away in a Manger"" are particularly well done. Do not be put off by the too slow version of ""Hark, the Harald Angels"" which starts the program. All of the following songs use beautiful harmony and accompaniments that are not run-of-the-mill."
1,Far to small!!,Well if you want to make teenie tiny loaves of baby breads maybe! I should have read the demensions but was in a hurry. I have always trusted Wilton. And can't imagine trying to grease every little pan and the clean up! Sent back!
3,ok - they are stuck together,"It would appear these are along a bar or grid, but they are not. they are actually all attached but nicely space for good heat and cooking. The downfall is popping the bread from the pans, you can't really lay them on the side to cool since they are all stuck together, and you don't really want to flip them upside down - so it's a bit of a trick."
4,My new Mini Loaf Pan,Love these little loaf pans. Price was great for a great product.This product is also very sturdy and can take some abuse.
3,Police Field Operations,"Too vague and general for someone using the book to use as a reference. Does not go into a lot of key points you actually use on patrol. Also, tends to make remarks that do not reflect the reality of todays police work. The author seems out of touch with policing today."
4,"Very basic, good book","I had to read this book for a promotional examination and found it to be a good refresher of the very basic points that we all learned at the beginning of our police careers. When I am approached by someone who is not yet in police work and wants to read a good, simply written and understandable book on law enforcement, I always recommend this one. It may seem to be too basic for those of us in this field for the years I have served, but many areas are still very relevant."
2,I hated it,My department changed the reading material for a promotional exam from Callibre Press to this junk. I was forced to read and internalize it; I hated it. This book is intollerable from the front cover. Take a look at the guy in the graphic. He is holding a flashlight in his gun hand; nuf said?
1,TERRIBLE,"Miserable read. Completely unrealistic and one-track BS - only about community policing. This book seems to be written by some retired policeman that is so far removed from the reality of day-to-day operations that makes one believe some of this to be fiction. Too many references to ""when I was an officer"". Several days of my life that i will never get back. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY ! ZERO STARS but unfortunately, that was not an option."
1,Probably the worse book ever written,Book is awful. Author repeats himself endlessly as if the audience is a group of 5 year olds. Information dated and not helpful. Far too many personal opinions of the author which he treats as undebateable in his book but are seriously flawed. Tests should not be based on this book.
3,Not Bad...,"This book is very monotonous. The book is thiner but is top to bottom literature. Ya I know its a book, it's supposed have a lot of writing. The problem is each chapter is 50-60 pages long and has minimal pictures. This combination makes the book very slow and it seems to take forever to make progress."
3,Decent book for police or CJ beginners,"The book was purchased for a promational exam. The book has a lot of good information and some obscure terms and techniques for law enforcement. The book is a very good source of information if one is beginning a career in law enforcement or criminal justice. But for veteran's this book is a little tiresome and goes over a lot of very basic and simplistic information. There were several pages and chapters that I was able to skim and bypass simply because it was simple and the information was already known. If you are many, many years out of the academy and preparing for a promotional test, this book may be a good refresher. Otherwise, save your money."
2,way smaller than they make it look online,"Yes, i guess it's my fault, but I was disappointed to see how small these really were. I know better now and will not buy jewelry online anymore."
5,perfect gift after all,"I bought this as a gift to my mother. I was nervous because my brother bought her larger diamond earrings. He told our mother to only wear his earrings at church. I encouraged her to wear mine often. She said ""These are perfect for daily wearing."" I am very glad I bought these."
2,Pretty but small,They appear to be much larger in the description. Expensive for the size. Made in china And not packaged nice for giving as a gift
3,its okay!,when i got it i was surprise its too small than i thought. but i think its okay anyways. be careful next time
3,Earrings are way too tiny,would not recommend for someone who wants a real diamond look as they do not look like real diamonds..perhaps because they are so small. also the back broke pretty easily the first day and the diamond fell out of my ear.
2,Swindled,The picture is deceiving. I thought they were going to be bigger but they are smaller than a pea. Probably won't be buying much jewelry from here no more.
2,10k Yellow Gold Princess-Cut Diamond Stud Earring,"I ordered two pair. They are both small, which I expected for the price. One pair is pretty. The other is milky in color. I was not very happy with that pair. I decided to keep those and give the other pair as a gift. I am a little embarrassed with the gift being so small."
2,diamond earrings,There's nothing really wrong with them other than they're small my fault for not realizing that. Packaging could use some work though because both posts were bent due to someone using a necklace display instead of an earring display inside the box.
4,I love it!,Great earring studs for my 3rd hole. i gave it 4 stars coz I was kinda expecting slightly bigger ones.
2,Not sure,"Never purchased earrings on line however i gave it a shot and wasnt to happy, the earrings are so tiny but it will not keep me from going threw amazon."
3,These are REALLY small,"I purchased these for my wife when they appeared in the 'deal of the day' section, and did not read the description very carefully. This is definitely a case where the top down view is decieving. I expected a simple, modest, pair of earings she could wear at work.These were tiny -- really baby sized earrings. Look at the side view before purchasing, and note the size of the backing. It's a small backing, and the earrings themselves are the size of a ball point pen.As long as you are aware of the size, I didn't see anything wrong with the quality. They seemed fine. But I expect them to get lost very quickly."
3,Diamond Studs...,"The studs were cute, but a little small. I would not agree that they are the size of a pin-head or . (see the other reviews) but they are certantily not big. I returned them b/c I was too afraid of loosing one. If you are in the market for a second pair of earrings or nose ring, I think they'd be perfect. I think Amazon should be take pictures of these earrings that are ""too scale"" because the picture is decieving."
4,Decent piece of diamond for my baby,"I purchased this diamond earring for my baby, color and size are okay for the price I paid."
2,super tiny,"these ear rings are super tiny. they are meant like for a baby and since they are baby sized, they should probly have the back that screws on. Didn't like them because of the size and I find it a hassle to return so gonna have to give them away as a gift to someone with a baby."
4,Good value,"These earrings were a good value, also because I got a discount.The diamond is sparkly, and I like the small size. I purchased the yellow gold. I don't like the large backings, they were uncomfortable, and I had to use smaller backings from another pair of earrings. Otherwise I recommend these, but wait until there's a 25% or more discount!"
3,You Get What You Pay For!,"I bought these earrings for my girlfriend for Christmas. I thought: hey, they're only 50 bucks, why not. When they arrived, they were just about the smallest things I have ever seen. They are barely bigger than this period---> . I guess I got what I deserve for buying diamonds off of the internet, but at least my girlfriend still loves me ;)"
4,earrings,"earrings were much smaller than I expected, however i did give them as a gift and my niece absolutely loved them. thanks"
3,Nice but....,They are the tiniest diamond earrings I've ever seen. I wore them nonstop a week and no one ever saw them. I do like them.
4,"Quality item, but lots smaller than the pic leads you to believe","There's no easier way to make one's wife cry at Christmas than by giving her diamonds. I purchased this item pretty close to Christmas, and was pleased with the speed at which it shipped. My only complaint is, although I knew the picture on the website was enlarged, the seller could do a better job of representing the actual size of the stones, as they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be. Still, I'm happy with my purchase, as was my wife. Thanks!"
1,"Pitifully small, not worth the money.","I received these to give ithem as a gift, but quickly realized they were too small to even give as a gift. My secret Santa requested these ear rings.she would not have been happy. Do not buy unless you have a microscope."
3,nice but small,A very nice set of SMALL earrings! You get what you pay for but the picture was very deceiving.... They make them look like they are a lot bigger than they really are. Look nice and worth what i paid...
1,get out those magnifying glasses...,"The photos do not do justice to these earrings - they are so small, that you can't even feel them in the velour bag. They have to be shaken out.Sent mine back right away."
5,Diamonds are forever!,It's a very nice earring. My wife loves so much that I can't unplug it from her ear. The Best cost/benefict product.
5,One of the better late 80's-early 90's shows,"I popped the first season of dvd's into my dvd player and it seriously brought back some good memories. I had remembered alot of the episodes from when it had first aired awhile back, and now im glad to have the first season on dvd. I can't wait for season 2 to come out so i can see more of Wanda Plenn (Lisa Dean Ryan)....what a babe."
4,Excellent,I give this 4 stars because there was only one special feature. I would have liked some commentaires or something.
1,No no no no,"If ever there was a show where all copies should be destroyed and never seen again, it's Doogie Howser. Even Harris would attest to this. No matter what he does or what movie he's in, he'll always be Doogie Howswer. Remember when you saw him years back on Starship Troopers? What was the first thing that went through your mind? It was probably ""Holy crap! It's Doogie Howser!!""This show was assinine, even for the 80's. Take an annoying boy genious doctor, put him with an Italian kid who portrays every Italian stereotype proudly, and you got a disaster of a show.Remember the rap song ""Docta Doogie! Doc Docta Doogie""? Then they's show Harris scolding the viewer and preaching about safe sex? Oh this show was just the worst. It should never have gotten past the pilot."
1,the equivalent of being touched by michael jackson except much creepier,"A stupid show, A stupid plot, Stupid charactors and very stupid writing make this one of the top 20 best ways to waste your time without reading Dr. phil's book. If you love a good waste of your life, then watch this show. If you feel too smart, then watch this show and I gaurantee you'll be much dumber after seeing it. I watched just the opening credits and have already forgotten how to breath, DOH! face turning blue, Mind going blank, Elizabeth I'm comin' to see ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
