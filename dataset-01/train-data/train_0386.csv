2,Too dated and difficult for a beginners book.,"I read this book as a Beginner and found it very hard to follow. David Sklansky may be a great poker player but he is a lousy author. Beyond the basic rules of the game, trying to understand the concepts are too much of a chore. I think you would do better buying a more recently written poker book. The recent boom in pokers' popularity has brought many other well written books on strategy and instruction to the market, and you don't need to waste your time and money trying to plow through this short book."
5,Nostalgic and outstanding,"An outstanding book texas holdem. If you are looking for something that is a little less technical than holdem for advanced players, then this book is for you. It is typical Skalansky, packed with knowledge and great strategy."
4,I was an amateur...,"I liked reading this book. It was a short read: 108 pages minus 10ish because there were blank pages to separate sections. I have loved no limit texas holdem, and I've been playing it and watching it on tv for about 7 years. This book is not a perfect fit for no limit, since it refers often to limit holdem. However, I still have learned things, and David put in his rankings for poker hands that are interesting. I have been playing better poker since reading this book. I would recommend it for the amateurs. This book is the first poker book I've read, so I don't have any other book to compare it too. But if you're an amateur that does not know about what position means to poker, than this can definitely help. I'm still looking for a better book for no limit holdem. Also, definitely buy this book used. The book itself cost me a single penny but 3.99 shipping. Don't pay more than 5 bucks for the book. I don't think it's worth that."
3,Not what I expected,"Although this book is rather short, it has some very heavy information that can be useful if studied and practiced thoroughly. However, the information in the book only pertains to limit Hold 'em, not No Limit. Furthermore, the book is a little out of date. However, it does have a lot of good stuff in it, and I would recommend it to any novice player."
4,great book,very cool book. Sklansky is extremely analytical and this book goes a long way to help players learn the game from the theoretical perspective
4,Popcorn,"Order was received in a timely manner and there were no surprises as faras the condition, it was as I expected. The whole process went very smoothly."
4,Exploration of Racial Tension Skin Deep,"""No Way Out"" has to be applauded for tackling the subject of racial tension at a time when it probably wasn't fashionable or commercially viable. That said, despite moments of searing truths, the film only treats it's subject matter superficially. To my mind it never gets to the root causes of institutionalized racism. The makers seem to slough it off to class resentment between blacks and the white underclass who are depicted here as wild eyed yahoos, none worse than an over-the-top Richard Widmark. Never mind that real power is wielded by the elites like the industrialists, the medical profession, and the film industry. Despite these quibbles there is alot to recommend here, not least of all a towering performance by a young Sidney Poitier as the intern caught in the middle of the racial maelstrom. Despite his youth, Poitier's radiant screen presence is much in evidence here and suggests the greater work that was yet to come for him."
1,No Way Out,That movie was horrible!!! Nowhere in the reviews did it inform the consumer that it was a film about such hatred!!!!! It should've said something like:WARNING: The following movie contains ONE of the most offensive words spoken!!! And it was used 26 times!!!This movie offered no redeeming value whatsoever. I hated it!!!!
3,"Famous for Poitier's Debut, but Watch Widmark","This could ""almost"" be called a lost classic.Notably, it's the film debut of Sidney Poitier, along with Ossie Davis in a small role, along with Ruby Dee as Poitier's wife.It's a very good debut for Poitier, but the real star here is Richard Widmark. Poitier is just finding his footing, but Widmark is the star of this film.He plays a racist who thinks that Poitier, as a black doctor, killed his brother, and there's not a false note in his performance.I saw this movie a few nights ago. It came on at 2am on cable and I stayed up until (almost) the end. The end is predictable. Worth watching for Poitier's debut, but especially for Widmark. He carries the film."
4,Not Film Noir but not bad.,"Far too often DVDs of 1940s & 1950s films are labeled as being Film Noir only to help sell the product. Such is the case here. There is no way that ""No Way Out"" qualifies as ""dark cinema,"" however, it still rates as a very good movie. Controversial when released, some of the drama seems forced at times but the story still entertains. The acting is first rate, especially by Sidney Poitier in his first role (and a starring one at that). Also making their debuts were Ozzie Davis and Ruby Dee."
4,Black Diamond,"My book is about baseball. I read tha the baseball starte at 1820's, and when it start only white player weard allow to play it but the blaack players could not play baseball with white players because they weard been raises with them. A lot of cuban people weard playing with whith people with no problem. The white people hate the black people because they weard all different colors. The black people made a team that was call the Negro Baseball League, and there was the American Baseball League. the black people wanted to play in the white league they had to do a lot of stuff to get into the white leage wich was realy hard. They had to go alldoway to cuba to change their names and their social security and everything else they had to do to get to the american league. The book is preaty sad and happy at the same time."
2,Good Information- But Dated,"Originally published in 1974 this book has lots of information on older style (wood) boats (wood) masts etc. Also the book is written more to the ""want to be a surveyor?- this is how you do it"" instead of ""looking for a used boat?-here is what details to check out. Also Nicholson is practices in Scotland and is geared toward european boats as opposed to us boats. I would suggest ""Surveying Fiberglass sailboats"" by Mustin as a better choice. Would I buy again? No."
2,Wish It Worked Better,"I have had this product since April 2001. When it works I love it; when it screws up [which is often] I want to throw it out my car window. Whenever I get back into my car, it seems to have jumped backwards at least 15 minutes in the book I am listening to & then I have to go through the tedious FF exercise & never quite know whee I am. The most frustrating part is when the machine skips forward. I have no idea if it's a minute forward, an hour forward AAAHHHH. But when it works, it's wonderful having it."
4,Digisette 32MB MP3 player,I love the fact that it plays on the casette deck in the car. I only give it 4 stars because there isn't a lot of memory. it holds about 10 songs unless you buy the memory upgrade.
1,Not as advertized,"Liar Liar. Be aware this item does not have USB connection, nor does it allow upgrade to 96mb as advertized. Play audible? No way with this model."
5,Great IDMS Chapter,This is one of the few books that contains anything about IDMS. All other IDMS books are out of print and hard to find. I authored Chapter 23 - The IDMS Chapter.
4,Great Case,"Works well. I don't drop my phone as much as my 12 year old - but this case has saved my phone any damage at all the few times I have. Perfect Color. Doesn't slide out of my pocket, nor is it hard to get out. I will buy the same brand / style again. 4 stars instead of 5 only because it doesn't really go all the way back together when you remove it for new screen protector installs. It STAYS closed - but doesn't want to click all the way back together like it did when brand new. It hasn't fallen off though unless I dropped it."
3,Wacky Price????,"I thought this very odd.....If you buy all the first 5 seasons individually, they cost you $150.37.....And if you buy them this way in a set it is over 30 bucks higher....I thought this was sort of a crazy way to price them........"
4,Wait A Minute Before You Buy,Wait A Minute Before You Buy this set...Did you know you can buy the Complete First SIX Seasons for LESS $$$!!! You can buy the Complete First SIX Seasons for $169.99 so save yourself a few bucks AND get an additional season...more for less now THAT'S a deal!
1,THE Worst !!,Now that my girfriend bought this DVD set I cant get her to watch anything else! This is not a good thing considering I absolutly can't stand this show!!
5,Perfect snuggle music for the summer!,This cd is amazing! it's perfect for getting comfy with that special someone on a nice summer evening... It's alot like modern day Martin Denny. alot better than Taboo and exile in my opinion
3,Gift mildly gives,"Zorn's present of mild-mannered cultured dance stands out even in his ultra-diverse catalog, but more as mere statement then anything truly worth remembering. These pleasant enough compositions would sit well on some of his mellower filmworks compilations but as a whole musical experience remains neither here nor there."
1,Bad Product,The product was so small that when putting it when cellular it was broken easily. It does not have good quality. The products of ebay are but better. I take 1 month in arriving.
2,Poor quality,This is a poorly made product. The adjustments for light direction barely work at all. Gets very hot. I would not recommend this light.
2,Disappointing Turtle Island,"We ordered this pool toy to use on vacation at a family pool in Florida. It is a nice big size, and holds up really well to many hours of fun. However, we were VERY disappointed in the quality of the design on the product. My family uses the spray on sunscreen as it is so much easier to apply. We found that when you were on Turtle Island after applying the sunscreen, the ink came off of the plastic onto your skin! In some cases it took a couple of days for it to come off. Most of the time we ended up turning it over and using the bottom instead so that we did not get ink on our skin or swim suits. I would not recommend the product solely due to the ink rubbbing off onto your body."
1,Didn't Last,"This purchase was to replace a 6' round pool float that the kids had used for over year until the hot Florida sun and pool chemicals did it in. We had hoped to get at least one summer out of this one. The kids loved it ... but it lasted only 1 weekend before getting a hole in it. It was fun for the short time it lasted, but I am very disappointed with the quality."
4,A Jazz Age Charmer,"What a pleasure to re-discover this little book, which I'd first read in about 1950 while a student at theUniversity of Washington. The author, whom I'd met socially, was the former wife of Glenn Hughes, esteemedHead of the U.W. School of Drama; and this ""novel,"" her first, was--everyone knew--a barely disguised memoirof their courtship and marriage back in 1920-something.Her story ""holds up"" admirably as a slight but charming story of the Jazz Age, centering on a very youngbride's fumblings toward maturity and self-realization...all remembered with humor, affection, and a dose ofnostalgia which has of course become more pungent with the years since rolled by. Mrs. Hughes' self-portraitis at once beguiling and unsparing of her teen-age callowness; and the older professor we knew in the '50swas endearingly recognizable in his younger incarnation.The city of Seattle, as it used to be, is also affectionately and accurately recalled."
3,I Don't Hate Comps,"I really enjoy compilations. They're a great way to discover new music. I have a formula for buying a good compilation CD: it should have a few bands you like, a few bands you're curious about, and a few bands you've never heard of. Follow this formula, and you will rarely be disappointed.That being said, this one is far from dud-free. Chris Spedding's ""Love on Death Row,"" Stan Ridgeway's ""Beloved Movie Star,"" David Was' ""Chow Main Street,"" and (sadly) Wayne Cramer's ""Crawling Outta the Jungle"" are indulgent, plodding, and not particularly rocking in even the most charitable sense of the world. Strung Out, Downset, and Cooter turn in tracks that ARE quite rocking, but otherwise pretty forgettable.The tracks that shine are from Mudhoney, Dee Dee Ramone, Quickie, Mother Superior, Lesbianmaker, and Pere Ubu. Of special note is Richard Hell's great song ""Oh."""
4,John Mayall's version is best,Walter Trout is a great blues guitarist and this album is good. The story is that John Mayall fell ill on tour and the band filled in with out him and the Walter Trout band was formed. Walter has gone on to greater albums than this but my personal favourite is still the original John Mayall 'Life in the Jungle' which also features Coco Montoya.
4,Welcome to Walter Trout!,"This is the CD to get if you're fishing for some Trout. A combo of studio and live tracks that will rock away your blues. Had only heard a track on Pandora and started looking at the reviews here. Now that I have the CD, I'm glad I bought it. Can't stop playing it in my car with volume on 11. I'd give it 5 stars but only 9 of the 10 tracks are great."
5,The best unknown music I've ever listened to,"Amazing how the same music can produce such opposite reactions. I agree with none of the assertions from the precedent rater. The music here is tremendously sophisticated and terribly brisk. And totally in the same style than the others volumes too, refering to some kind of jazzy rythmic soundtracks for improbable TV series.""Whitesploitation"" would probably be the best word to describe this music. What you get in more here than in the precedent versions is a last venomous 13' track which, in my point of view, makes this set to be prefered."
3,Sigma Lens Review,"This item was received on March 2nd in good condition. After two weeks of use, however, the autofocus was unable to focus on any object consistently. It would sometimes be able to do so and other times it could not. Mostly this seems to occur with the lens is extended and the object to focus on requires the lens to retract. The retraction motor seems week and unable to pull the lens back in all the way. However, this could be because the lens ""thinks"" it is focused and stops the focus movement. I cannot tell which. I will be sending this one back.We are, however, pleased with the Signma lens in general. We use it a great deal and have two camera so equipped for our business."
2,Picture quality are good but make sure to have warranty,"I bought this lens in December 2007 and just start to use it from this March. The picture quality is good but needs a lot of light and contrast for the AF to work.In June, during an outing, one of the element (glass) fell out of it's holding socket and the lens would not retract to below 1:3.Since I bought this lens in gray market, so that there's no warranty. I just open the lens and fix it myself, works fine.However, the story did not end there. Just yesterday, during some test shots at home, the lens would not focus and the motor is trying but could not move. I switch to Manual but the focusing ring would not stay at M mode and I can turn the ring freely and it won't adjust the focus (in AF mode, the ring supposed to have resistence from the motor gear and you should not try to adjust manually).If you are thinking of buying this lens, make sure to buy it with warranty or better yet extended warranty."
5,Moving Music for the Soul,"I think this is Olivia Newton John's best CD to date. Her voice and her message have matured. I fell in love with the words, the melodies, the mood, the emotions the songs evoked in me. I have listened to this CD dozens of times and I never get tired of it. I find it moving and uplifting. It really taps into the human experience of love, pain, personal growth, and the lightness that comes from being able to let go.... and let life flow. If you're into yoga, meditation, personal growth, or healing, buy this CD."
5,Beautiful,I absolutely loved this cd. You also have to see and hear her on Deepak's The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. Her beautiful singing on there made me want her CD.
1,Are you kidding?,Never received the item and still waiting for promised credit from you. As I have indicated before this process and your customer service are a joke. The companies you use know full well they don't have the prodct. When pressured they just send anything and now I have to hassle with you people for a refund. Should be illegal. I will never use this site again that is for certain.
5,Helped me through a disaster...,"On April 10th 2009 our house was hit by a tornado, F-4 grade,and the house collapsed with us in it. Our cars were also demolished. We climbed out the bedroom window to get out of the house. We are fine, have replaced our cars and bought a new home, but we were devastated and it was extremely traumatic. A good friend gave me this CD a couple of weeks after the storm and I have listened to it in the car, on and off, for the past four months. It has provided healing, has helped give me courage and has helped sustain me through the heartbreak and trauma of what happened. This is truly a CD to use when healing from health problems or any other kind of trauma. I applaud Olivia Newton-John for this CD; she has the voice and the heart of an angel. I highly recommend purchasing this. Wishing you blessings and much peace always..."
5,Innovative!,"Olivia Newton-John and Canadian songwriter and performer Amy Sky teamed up together to record this pivotal CD. Newton-John, who turned to meditation and introspection to deal with breast cancer in 1992, turned her difficult experience into a healing journey. A must for anyone facing adversity, cancer, loss, grief, or any personal challenge, Olivia's CD is grounding and deeply empowering. Structured on the seven chakras, and interspersed with brief linking interludes, Newton-John is at her lyrical best on this CD. Songs such as Love is Letting Go, Pearls on a Chain, and the title track Grace and Gratitude are moving and inspirational. Highly recommended"
5,Livvy - still brilliant,"I, like a lot of these other review-ers, have been an Olivia fan for many many years.. 33 to be exact.i remember buying my first Livvy cassette - Totally Hot. I think it burnt out (sorry!) after a couple of hundred play sessions.BUT, I had not heard of this particular album, until a couple of weeks ago. As soon as i did, i was straight onto the website for a listen..I think it took about 3 minutes to find my c/card & order two copies. One for myself, and one for my ""new-age"" mother-in-law-to-be. Who, after only knowing Grease), is now a new fan.It's a brilliant album. whatever your mood.Thank God CD's should last longer than the old cassettes - cause this one is going to get a huge physical (sorry!) workout.....Livvy sounds brilliant.""........AND I THANK YOU!!!!"""
5,FLAWLESS from start to finish!!!,"I never thought Olivia would top Warm and Tender, her cd of standards and children's songs from the 80's, but this cd really is a work of art. The music, songwriting, her amazing voice, etc. are all top notch. She should stick to this spiritual/ new age/ world music arena for future releases. It suits her and it is heartfelt. Go see her live. You'll be amazed at her voice, as pure and breathtaking as it was 30 years ago.If you're looking for Olivia's best, beside this perfect cd, check out Warm and Tender, Totally Hot, Xanadu, Don't Stop Believin', and of course, Gold."
5,Luba with gratitude,"Olivia's CD speaks and sings to my heart and soul! So sweet and angelic, her voice transcends all the doing-ness gently into just being-ness (without being swarmy. Because you understand that her journey through cancer inspired this.) So when I'm in the mood, I'll just pop this into the CD player in my car, and sing along while driving the road fandango. Thanks Angel!"
2,Love to BBQ,"I love the case for storage purposes. However, I was dissapointed that the handles are plastic, which isn't mentioned in the description. I've seen this same brand w/ all steel handles so I assumed this was going to be the same."
4,Amorphis being Amorphous... as always!,"Amorphis is quite an intresting group, probably the *ONLY* group I have heard that has been able to live up to their name. Amorphis cannot be defined by one genre, they are, well as they're named, amorphous! (Meaning shapeless and without definate form)I am a big fan of Amorphis's deep and hard death metal songs, they're some of the best I have heard. That voice is *NOT* present on this CD, it's only hinted at in a few of the songs. This CD is very melodic. The instrumentals are subtle but powerful and complex. Amorphis broke away from their death metal roots in this CD, who's to say what their next CD will bring?I liked this CD, but being a big fan of their death metal capability, and finding none, I left a star off. Hopefully they'll include a track (much like greed) of death metal in their next cd."
5,Amorphis: Am Universum,"The cd was great! It's something different from Amorphis, a little slower and not as heavy as most of their other work. But I loved the melodies in the songs, and the cd is one of my most listened to in my collection!"
4,Upgrade from Last,"The only thing that bothers me with this album as it did with Tuonela is Pasi's vocal range. He has a nice melody, but he's often stuck in the same chord--although with this album it's somewhat blended and faded and amplified by digital effects. If you hear the whole album through, it begins to get mundane by the middle song,(Crimson Wave) which is a great song. I think that's the only thing that keeps holding back Amorphis. Am Universum is a great album--top songs Goddess, Crimson Wave, and Alone, but too bad it doesn't have better singing on it."
2,Downhill,"I am usually willing to give Amorphis the benefit of the doubt because they have proven themselves in the past. I didn't like Elegy at first but i stuck with it and now think it is easily their second best work (Tales) and is not far from the top. There is no question Amorphis has, well, morphed since the early days. I have no problem with that in it self, but the thing is, this album isn't good. The songs sound the same for the most part and the instrumental work mushes together and competes instead of complements. it isn't really melodic, more like chaotic. I don't think the saxophone helps at all. pasi's voice seems out of place here. The only highlight of this album is the first track, Alone, which is a very good song. The vocals are excellent and the song moves slowly. If you encounter this album in a used CD store for about 2$, you might check it out for that song. Otherwise stick with early Amorphis work."
1,bland,"If you didn't like Tuonela, well, this is more of the same, so stay away by all means. I bought this CD for $3, and it certainly wasn't even worth that. I'm a fan of the Metal band Amorphis once was. All these songs sound the same to me. What are these guys doing? The last good song they made was ""greed"". Amorphis has Metallicitis; they reek of a band that should just quit."
1,Pure Garbage!,"This album is absolute junk! These guys make Metallica's newer albums seem like classics! I'm not just saying this with a close mind here, I've heard it (or at least as much as my poor soul could handle). For crying out loud, its not even metal at all! I hate to say it, but I think they've gone goth here. Beleive me, I feel like I am giving this thing far too much creadit by giving it 1 star. For those of you who give this more than 1 star, I feel bad for you all for liking this stupid and talentless stuff."
1,"Tastes disgusting, does not dissolve, is foamy","I thought I had read other reviews that said this product was specially formulated to dissolve easily in liquid (even water) and I figured natural flavor would be largely tasteless. I've tried everything and this stuff is still disgusting! It does NOT dissolve, no matter now much you blend, shake, let sit, etc. There will always be clumps. More importantly, you can ALWAYS taste the off-spoiled milk taste of this product. Even in shakes, it makes the shakes extra foamy and is hard to swallow. The ONLY luck I've had using this is putting it in pancake batter (beware, as it makes the pancakes burn, as it changes the property of the batter). Very disappointing. I feel misled by other users' product reviews and have no idea what I'm going to do with the huge tub of this stuff now."
2,Stronger than three sleeping pills.,"Having been on a Russian History bender for the past year, I was anxious to learn more about its Medieval Period. This book, however restricts itself primarily to machinations within the Greek Orthodox Church. Liberally peppered with footnotes which only a cloistered monk would find interesting, and written in a choppy, hard to read style, this book is a real ""nodder.""The author assumes in his reader a strong background in 13th and 14th century Byzantine and Russian history. He uses terms which are obscure, and often times, rendered in Greek. Added to Meyendorff's penchant for paragraph long sentences within sentences, this book is nearly unreadable. But if you find yourself having trouble sleeping, this could be your best medicine."
3,"Only good as a small, lightweight life preserver.","I was looking for a compact, lightweight backup and thats what I got. After trying it, I wouldn't want to actually rely on it full time."
5,Easy read,I couldn't put this book down. I have read many holocaust books and this is one of the good ones.
4,To the point,I really liked how simple and to the point the book was written. I have read a few of these types of books. You could really feel what Stella and her family went through. Good book and I would highly recommend it.J.P.
4,beautifully crafted pop,"I continue to listen to almost all of these tracks months after buying the CD. That rare for me. There's always something of melodic interest, I like the mildly wry lyrics, and the studio recording is perfectly mixed. There's a studied quality to their music that might turn some folks off, but anyone who likes the mid-tempo tracks of Stereolab, for example, will likely enjoy this CD.Its a shame that the band seems to have broken up, but this is a great final CD for them if indeed this is the last we'll hear from them."
4,"Quick, Interesting, Engaging Read","I agree with the other reviewer - excellent airplane read. It made my flight time ""fly by"" as well. I enjoy this series, interesting characters."
4,MURDER ON MULBERRY BEND,A captivating read that keeps the pages turning to the end! Victoria Thompson has done it again! I highly recommend it!
4,Good Read!,Great New York SettingsWonderful CharactersSpecial Relationship with Lead CharactersInteresting StoryTakes Real Places with Some Real Characters from the Past
4,Murder on Mulberry Bend,"Enjoyed the historical aspect of this book in early twentieth century New York. Interesting how bigoted the Irish were towards the Italians, not even allowing them to worship together in church (Italians were relegated to the basement to worship). Good character development and certainly entertaining as a mystery novel."
4,It's fun but easy to guess,"I read this book with excitement. It seemed to me that the author gave us enough clues to guess who the murderer was and why. In contrast, both main characters didn't get them, these brought me the excitement and really wanted to know when they would know the truth."
2,"No DVD, book only","Thought the title listed says Book and DVD workout, I received the book only. There was no DVD. Book seems okay but I am now searching for DVD. Seller did refund my money though. Confirm when buying that they include the DVD."
2,Not that great,"This book was okay, it wasn't anything spectacular. I had been doing pilates for about a year when I bought it because I wanted to try something new but this book really didn't challenge me all that much. I suggest Siler's Pilates Body instead which doesn't use a ball but is basically the best book on Pilates I have ever read."
4,So Good!!,"This is a terrific book. I wanted to take a Pilates class but didn't have time to join. This book has allowed me to do my own workout on my own time. It starts with the basics to make sure you are doing things properly. From there you can add more difficult or complicated exercises until you have a complete, challenging workout. This is the best workout ever!"
1,Not worth the money,"If you have ever used an exercise ball, this book has nothing new to offer. I bought the book specifically for the CD. The CD is terrible - really no program to follow. It is so basic and doesn't take you through an organized routine. I looked through the book; watched the CD one time, and the book is now in my garage sale pile!!"
2,Just like any hairspray,"It's simply a hairspray, nothing special about it. If you really think this hair spray has a different chemical to bond to the toppik better then purchase it. I would compare this hair spray with any other strong hold hair spray you can buy anywhere. I don't want to burst your bubble and say Santa don't exist. I was one of those guys dooped thinking this hair spray was different. Save your money and just use your existing hair spray. Honestly, I want my money back but I already paid for the dumb shipping and handling fee so I'm stuck with it. Anyone want a buy a used Toppik Hairspray?"
1,Toppik Fiberhold Spray stinks,"I just bought the Toppik fibers and spray today and used for the first time. I am a woman with thinning hair, and I must say that I am very pleased with the results. BUT, the spray STINKS!!! It has such an overwhelmingly strong smell that I don't plan on using it again - I don't understand why the manufacturer found it necessary to make it scented at all . . . I can't believe that men use this and can tolerate it (or that their girlfriends/wives can stand it!).Unfortunately, the company website has no way of contacting them via email, and since I can't call them while I'm at work, I'm stuck making my comments on this review.I won't be buying the spray again, and will just use my regular unscented hairspray to hold the fibers in place."
2,Nothing Special,"First off, the Toppik Fibers are a great product and I couldn't be more satisfied. However, the ""Fiberhold Spray"" is just like any other strong hairspray. I'm a guy with long hair, so it's somewhat inconvenient for me to use hairspray (I normally leave it natural). I found that the moisture of the hairspray made the fibers actually clump more, so I stopped using it after a week and I've had no problems with the fibers. The most disappointing aspect of this product is it's alcohol-based, which can dry the shafts out and make your hair break easier (not to mention it burns my sensitive scalp). Hairspray would be good for activities where you'll sweat, but I'd recommend using a non-alcohol spray ."
2,Well....,"Honestly, didn't see a big difference when I used the fibers without the spray. I just add a little spritz to my hair."
3,IT WAS A GIFT SO i CAN'T REALLY GIVE A RATING,DIDN'T HEAR ANY COMPLAINS SO THE RECEIVER OF THE GIFT MUST HAVE LIKED IT OR i AM SURE i WOULD HAVE HEARD
3,Great Product!,Got it for my boyfriend!! Holds the toppik fibers amazingly well!!! definetely recommend it! Its not messy and it doenst feel thick like other hold sprays
2,Save your money,"This is no better than any other hair spray. Just buy some generic spray on sale at the drug store. The Toppik fibers, hair fattener and pump attachment are really good products."
5,Hair Spray Help,Toppik Hairspray is a nice product to use with Toppik Fibers. It helps hold them in place. I only use it on areas that have had Toppik allplied.
4,good hair spray for natural toppik fiber,"I used this before, it has good effect on holding the special Toppik made hair fiber. The only thing is it's like selling medicines at pharmacy store, moderately high price at above $30 for just a small bottle of spray. Would be a good thing if this can be sold as ordinary merchant products on the shelf of many supermarkets so price can be more competitive."
3,TOPPIK Fibrehold Review,"I have been using this product for the past year and half. I originally bought it from the actually manufacturer but they no longer ship the product internationally. As a result I have had to buy the product here. The cost of the product is pretty much the same as what the manufacturer charges. However, the shipping and handling costs for this product here is absolutely astronomical!! If I could find somewhere where this product can be shipped for a far more reasonable price, then I would buy there."
4,Good videos,"This was a good value at $6 at K-Mart. I think a future live concert performance would be better, so perhaps in 2004 this may be produced. She is on a 2001 Farm Aid live performance which is good."
3,mildly entertaining,"I remember loving ""I Married Joan"" as a kid. Unfortunately, this sitcom doesn't hold up well over time. The comedy is lack-luster at best. Buy ""The Honeymooners"" and ""Amos 'n' Andy"" instead. They are both delights that pass the test of time, and I watch them over with great appreciation. But ""I Married Joan"" just leaves you thinking the 50's were dorky."
4,Collector's dream!,"Ralph Gleason has allowed to much politics into his epistles and not enough history of jazz lately. Sad, this is a collectors's dream. Two of the greats Torme' and McCrea while not actually together, are quite together musically. They approach the songs quite differently from their later, more engineered and ""choreogrpahed"" stuff. Listen to a copy of the original Rhapsody in Blue compared to what Telarc did to it and you'll know what I mean. ""We've Got A World That Swings"" is perhaps my most favorite. This tune came from a Jerry Lewis movie called the ""Nutty Professor."" I gotta say the best recorded version I have of this tune is the 4 Freshmen from a Liberty disc they made in the early 60's. But what I can tell you, it is almost extinct,therfore quite valuable to a collector of 20th Century jazz. One lsten to Torme' and you'll want this archival disc..and it probably won't be there. Sad!"
3,Protects but not very handy,"I needed something that would protect my new audiovox 6600 pocket pc that would still let me hear when the phone rings. The pouch that comes with the phone muffled the sound so much that it was impossible to hear. This case seemed to be the most protective of everything I found. It does work to protect the phone but almost too well, there are reasons why I need to get to the screen and it is a pain to open and close all the time. The other thing is there is not way to open the cover for the headset jack with the case closed. Then once the cover is open there is no place for the cover to go to get out of the way. All in all this serves the purpose but if I see something better I would give this up in a minute."
1,Failed within the 1st week,This piece of junk failed within the first week. I sent it to a Panasonic Repair Center and after 3 weeks they couldn't repair it and now I have to sent it to the East Coast. I spent $300 for a product that not even the PANASONIC repair center can repair!!! Their warranty is worth absolutely nothing!!!STAY AWAY FROM PANASONIC! THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTE JUNK. IT IS SO BAD THAT PANASONIC REPAIR CENTERS CANNOT REPAIR IT!!!!
1,Not a quality product,"This system has several design flaws. One is the remote control design - intermittent at best. Another is the tray design. It misaligns itself, and scrapes up the disks inside. Do not buy this product. Panasonic needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. This really should have 0 stars, but that was not an option. A waste of time here."
2,Horrible interface (on screen and remote),"PROS: crisp clean picture, great sound, plays DVD+R, DVD+Rs with JPEGsCONS: HORRIBLE remote, HORRIBLE UI - especially for MP3s and JPEGs, shuffle/random play takes 30+ seconds between disks, JPEG image quality not nearly as good as DVD movies and took a long time to render, setup was NOT quickRecommendation: If you're willing to spend the bucks for this system then spend a bit extra and get an Onkyo or Denon receiver/speaker package and buy the DVD, CD changer separately. If you want cheap, buy cheap like an Apex. And above all VISIT a store and use the system for 15 minutes or more before buying!"
2,I almost had a nervous breakdown,"Well, to start with, the first one I brought home, the CD/DVD tray would not open and I had to take it back and exchange it for a new one. All seemed to be going well until I realized that it is not playing my TV programs in surround sound. I tried everything I could think of and I can't fix the problem. The manual is very difficult to use. It gives you a million little buttons to push on the remote which makes a million different things pop up in one or more of several possible display areas. It is nice that it tells you what button makes what thing pop up on the screen but very little to no explaination of how that function is supposed to enhance your listening experience. There is NO area of the manual that addresses difficulties with the TV sound. I'm calling Panasonic tomorrow and if they can't figure it out, I'm taking the piece of junk back"
5,Innocence Revisited,"This is a wonderfully innocent film. The story is such a delight, of course, and it was such fun to refamiliarlize myself with O'neil's play. Even beter, it's a delight to have this along with my most-loved Broadway Musical, ""Take Me Along"" on which it was based. A great gift for literature and musical lovers. JLFL, N.C."
1,Didn't work,"They don't work because Dowsing is not real.Check out all the places where they have been scientifically debunked in peer reviewed journals and online; and most publicly by James Randi. It is called the Ideomotor effect. Instead give your $11 to something that is real, and useful, like feeding hungry kids..."
5,Great CD,"I bought this CD initially for ""Camera One"", but after listening to it several times I just fell in love with it! To me, this CD is really pretty sad, with lyrics about suicide and depression. But, it's just so beautiful. It really had an effect on me, and I hope that the Josh Joplin Group continues to come out with great CDs like this one!"
5,Great Chill Music (or any music for that matter!),"Whether you are looking for something wake you up in the morning or to chill by the pool with, this is a cd for you. This premire album has a sound that most generations will enjoy. (Heck, my mom even listened to it.) With songs like Gravity and Camera One, this cd is well rounded and beautiful.An all around appeal will take this group far."
5,Unbelievable,Simply one of the best records I've listened to in years. Josh Joplin Group has drawn comparisons with bands like R.E.M. and Dave Mathews; the comparison is well disserved. The beautiful music on this album is reminiscent of such great works such as Reckoning and Under the Table and Dreaming. I truly hope that we will be hearing much more from this great band in the coming years. Buy this album. Even if you don't paticularly like alt/folk rock you will still appreciate the wonderful songwriting and excellent musicianship.
2,Sorry Josh!,"The lead singer's voice sounds exactly like Michael Stipe of REM. No matter how many times I've listened to this album, none of the tracks really grab me. I love the lyrics (especially in ""Human""), I give you that. But his voice kind of drones on, and doesn't seem to have the right amount of soul required for such brilliant lyrics. Although, I have to admit some of REM's stuff once did this same thing, until I got used to it...but none of the songs are as classic and original as any of their stuff.And I can understand the comparisons to Semisonic lyricwise, but John Mayer? no. (John rocks)If you love REM, you'd probably like this CD, otherwise I'd research a little more before you buy it."
4,Great Lyrics Great Music,"The title ""Useful Music"" sums up this album nicely. This record is a great piece of work that is just plain fun to listen to. Many of the songs reflect Joplin's love of folk music and Phil Ochs, but the band work the songs up into great pop masterpieces. If you enjoy pop-rock music with meaningful lyrics than this album is a must for you."
4,Complete rock intelligence.,"""Useful Music"" must be one of the most high-quality albums I've heard this year.In some press releases, JJB has been compared to REM. I am going to step on many Atlantan's toes and say Josh Joplin is better than REM. Folk rock may run in the Georgia family, but Josh is such an intelligent lyricist and *darnit* such a good songwriter that he transcends a label like ""alternative"" or ""folk."" If I had to class this one, it would be under ""eclectic genuine music.""Buy it if you are in the mood for beautiful, poetic, undiluted good rock in the same vein as Shawn Mullins, Chris Isaak, and Barenaked Ladies."
4,Get it while you can!,"The Josh Joplin Group (formerly the Josh Joplin Band) no longer exists, so pick up this CD while you still can! This is the best one that is commercially available.Joplin is a rocker who wants to be a folk singer, and his lyrics tend to both quirky and intriguing. Basically, I highly recommend this CD. Give it a few listens and you won't be disappointed."
1,"Rust, Rust, Rust!","Beware. This dish rack is compact and cute, but it rusts big time. Also the cutlery rack is awkwardly designed, so knives and forks lean way over and sometimes flip out."
1,Didnt work,I will need to return. Installed next to original - wont boot. Installed instead of original - wont boot. Switched slots wont boot. Take out boots fine.
3,it is what it is...,"you can't expect too much from such a ""bargain"" pair of shoes... they tend to ""wrinkle"" very easily, but they are light, comfortable, and look good."
2,Poor Customer Service Follow-up,"I needed to change the address for the shipment on an item and it turned into a nightmare. Their customer service number was always busy, and when I did get through I didn't get a sense of security that my matter would be resolved. They have not followed up when they said they would and I have had to call back several times to find out the status of my order. Not good in my opinion."
5,Great final release from a band that never should've broken up!,"Wow is all I can say. Great last album from this band. All kinds of styles on this disc. From metal to pop, jazz, to plain just weird! Swimming in December is my fav along w/ Future and Ordinary(great acoustic number from Ben). Should always be in print!"
5,Something to Say,"This is one fantastic collection of songs. It is truly disappointing that GC is making this their final release together, but what a way to sign off.I should also point out, as was mentioned in an earlier review, that the song ""Another Hill"" is one of the greatest rock songs I've ever heard. There is more creativity and power in one lick of this song than there is in all of the pseudo-rock garbage that radio stations play these days.Everything about this CD was pulled-off perfectly: the vocal blending, the songwriting, the very impressive guitar work of Wally Farkas, and the instant chemistry between GC and King's X drummer Jerry Gaskill, who exhibited his always-exceptional beats for each track."
5,A very appropriate swan song,"The Galactic Cowboys have never disappointed when it comes to fresh, wonderful music. Let It Go is no different! The band's final effort is filled with heart wrenching tunes like Wally Farkas' vocal debut on ""Life and Times"" to political commentary on ""Hey, Mr."". Long time fans of this band are really going to miss the music, but the Cowboys left us with an album that will remain a favorite of mine for years to come."
3,But I don't want to let go!...,"3 and 1/2 stars: This is GC's swan song and it's a pretty darn good one. All their trademark heavy riffs, goofy insights, introspective lyrics and ballads are here in spades. I would have given the disc a higher rating but really, what is the point of ""Boom"" and ""Bucket of Chicken""? I know the guys have active senses of humor, but I just thought those tracks were stupid. Also, ""Dirty Hands"" is pretty dull. ALL THAT SAID, this is a great disc, especially ""TIM"", ""Disney's Spinnin'"", and ""Another Hill"" (listen to the massive bass guitar on that one!) are awesome. Not essential, but very enjoyable."
4,"trance for your mind, body and soul","This latest installment of the Psychotrance series features DJ Brian who is just as good a programmer as D:Fuse. This mix flows and hits it off for the discerning trance lover. Some of my personal favorites are Christian West-""Rotation"", Resistance D- ""Feel High(Spacefrog and Timeload remix)"", and Signs of Life- ""Contact (Lee Coombes mix)"". For anyone who hasnt heard any release from the Psychotrance series this is a good place to start. You really cant go wrong with a Moonshine release!!"
3,"Nice CD, but nothing outstanding really","The title 'psycho trance'is a bit misleading since this cd has very little if any real trance on it. The tracks on this cd are basically progressive in nature and are not as dark as I was expecting. There are a few gems to be found on this disk, but I was hoping to hear darker, harder trance when i bought this mix."
5,DJ Brian can do no wrong,"Look, here is the deal. DJ Brian is the MAN. His Hardesertrance mix CDs were good. So is this one. It has just the right mix of music, and evolving flow, and raucus, hard beats. I can listen to it over and over. I am listening to it right now and I am having a hard time staying in my seat and not getting up to move. This is what techno and trance were meant to be. Not some over-compressed noise, not some cheesey major chord anthem, not some ugly mishmash of rhythms, but brilliant, effervescing, continuous motion, the motion of music. The tracks are unique and yet part of the greater whole, which is the mix that flows from DJ Brian's decks. Buy, and you will enjoy."
3,just a note,"Okay to all of people out there who are misguided, thinking you're so clever by saying sarcastically that this cd is ""too psycho/hardcore"" for you (notice the spelling)- you all need to go to school or something. The root ""psycho"" has to do with the mind, not being crazy. Psycho-trance series are supposed to be thought of as trance for your mind in a sense, not necessarily psychadelic but along those lines. That being said, thanks."
2,More chinese crap,Looks pretty and went together easy. BUT! metal was twisted after first use really inferior made unit but it is pretty until used
5,i love these razors - less to the landfill,I love these refill blades - they work great - and it's less to fill up the landfills!
5,Very nice,would recommend this one. Very relaxing and upbeat. Artist did a very good job on this CD. Love the instruments
5,World Beat Brazil CD - My Comments,"This is one of the most sensuous CDs I've ever listened to. The music is earthy, sensual, passionate and thought-provoking. It's great for dinner parties or just enjoying a quiet evening with a glass of wine. It's relaxing and a great mood enhancer. I introduced this CD to friends who also own and love it."
5,"Another ""Code of the West"" gem.","Kent Conwell does it again. The lone stranger in town standing up to the local land-grabbing villain - not because it's the easy thing to do, but because it is the right thing to do. Excellent characters and savvy plotting make this a worthwhile read. Western storytelling at its best."
2,"Often Interesting, Sometimes Challenging, Rarely Engaging","My first Mcdonald novel, after reading a short story of his in a recent anthology. Very disappointing, the all to brief bits about the Chaga (An alien ecosystem forcibly unleashed on the earth to the supposed benefit of mankinds future evolution - pity about the rest of life on earth) are excellent, but the novel is otherwise far too long, this would have better as a novella or short story. Mcdonald has little else to say, can't do plot, is very variable on characterisation and his fiercely held, and not very original, political views permeate the novel making everything, including the ending, far too predictable. He doesnt even seem capable of seeing that his wonderful Chaga is easily viewable as the grossest most arrogant form of 'pseudo colonization' imaginable."
1,Irritating,"I bought this through one of the Amazon lists, because I found its title in distinguished company. Result: one of the worst books I have ever read. What turned me off since the very beginning was the style: contrived, artificial, kitsch, not to mention that the main character -- a pathetic monument to female ambition -- wasn't interesting at all."
5,One of tha best CD's of tha YEAR!,"2 words:...uh, Awesome.This CD is better than the other Satellite, but only because of the remixes. The DVD really isn't much, just live performances and a little biography of P.O.D. But it's still awesome. I'll give you a preview of some of my favorites:Alive-Best on the CD. You've probably heard it on the radio. Nice lyrics and cool b-ground. Its remix is just the same with a little less b-ground music and not as much echo in Sonny's voice.Boom-A lot of force in the voices and a cool chorus, like most of the songs on the album. Its remix is really cool, because it switches around the lyrics.Youth Of The Nation-Rounded out with a loud chorus and a catchy rythym. The remix isn't too much different.GET THIS CD!"
1,Worthless and Misleading,"This book is a mish-mash of stuff from medieval grimoires, rennaisance soul-selling manuals, and various demonologies. The author clearly doesn't understand the material, and the instructions given are confused and incomplete.There are so many better sources for this stuff that there is no reason to own this book, even if your goal is commerce with demons!"
1,I can't believe that I believed this book once,"As a Wiccan, I started out with hogwash such as this. This is the most uneducated, fictional work that I had ever read. The sad thing about it is that I once believed the nonsence in the book. So if you are interested in REAL witchcraft, get a book by Scott Cunningham, Ray Buckland, or Ed Fitch. This book is more made up than DJ Conways witchcraft books."
1,Very Incorrect,This book bashes witches and everything that they are about. It also makes witches look like they are crazy for instance the ingredients and rituals depicted in the book. Don't waste your money.
1,"Actually, I give this book 0 Stars","This book was complete dival. I am just thankful that I had had the common sense to research witchcraft from other more dependable resources. Please do not let this book be the only reading you do on the subject! It is missleading and portrays witches as evil and sadistic. It is a far cry from complete and it is DEFINATELY NOT up to date! All of the information given in the beginning about withes is most certainly one- sided and very anti-witch. PLEASE do not let this form your oppinion of witches! The only thing that the spells are good for is a good laugh. So, unless you have some donkey ears, fox testicles and bear brains hanging around to cast these spells, I would suggest you steer VERY clear of this book."
3,"good but not ""complete""","this little book go so on my nevers until i bought it personally i don't find it ""complete"" in any way it's all just a bunch of stuff thrown together if your into magic wether it be wicca, voodoo, witchcraft, cerimonial, or satanism you can do youself a favor save the money for the books, grimores..etc that the magic in this thing is based on and have a complete text on it rather than just a few little notes however it does have a lot of intresting rituals ,spells, definately not for a dabbeler or beginner personally i burnt my copy mainly because it isn't what i was looking for"
1,CRAP!!!,"I'm so offended by this book. In witchcraft (the real kind) there are two basic rules: the second is that anything you do comes back to you threefold, but it's only an extension of the first one: HARM NONE. True WitchCraft respects natures beings, and would never actually use their parts in spells. Secondly, true Witches do not beleive in Satan, for he does not exist. This book was written by Statanists, and I would NEVER recomend a book like this to anyone. If you want good books on REAL Wicca, I would suggest The Spiral Dance, or Embracing the Moon, another good one is 13 Moons to Master Natural Magic... There are so many wonderfull books out there, I wish I hadn't read this one. If I could, I would give it 0 stars."
1,OH...MY...WHAT LIES!!!!,"I am a withch and just about everything in that book is lies and it makes me sick!!! If you are a beginner than this is definatley not the book for you. also any one who is a beginner or is not a witch and is exploring the wonderful world of magic, please do not judge witches by the contents of this book, what is in that waste of money and paper is not what whitches do!!! -some guy some where"
1,oh gawd.... what a waste of money,"Iam a beginner in the subject of witchcraft and i have read a couple of books on the subject that were a bit bad but this one just surprised me how BAD it was! The spells in this book are almost all just impossible to do and some dont even work! I regret that i wasted money on this book, if all you beginners out there want a good book get, Mastering Witchcraft or A Modern witche's guide to magic and spells."
2,Pretty Weak,"This is by far, the funniest book that I've read on witchcraft. The spells are ancient and complicated. Most of the ingredients needed are absolutly inpossible to attain and the spells that are workable, are ludicrous. But for $6 bucks, it's a quick read."
3,Dis is an Alright book,"True Some of these spell are impossible to do. But it is a good book to read.Another thing is that who ever comments on this book and i Quote"" that you can case a spell to have some one has a miscarriage."" UnQuote Who ever is that from San Antonio of Teaxs. Cuz there is now where to be found that you can do that spell. in the book. One more thing is that when i read this book my heart start to beat a littler faster then it usely dose and also i Quote that i do get DZ, also i start to get burning up."" UnQuote. it is a good book to me. when i do ever try this spell and if it works then i'll give it a 5 but right now its a 3."
3,Interesting,"I like the first three chapters, wich are very informative, and i like the Glossary, the planetary amulets are very acurate as well as the magical hours, some spells and potions are good but mosts are very gross, their are some other good information, but I got this book because it looked interesting, and i wanted an entertaining read! i see many people hear disscusing about this book, some say the fluffy wiccans dont like this book because its dark or somthing, and then some other people who say that this book has real witchcraft or somthing and that the wiccans are trying to hide it! But i realy dont know maybe some people are very paranoid and maybe others are very morbid! but i dont know!?! but i dont take this book very seriously and im not realy against this book either! I say its pretty interesintg, has alot of history, and information of older books, many wich you cant find anymore! oh and the main reason i would buy this book is for the biblioghraphy!"
3,Fair,"I really like this book. It's kinda like my bible. It has a lot a valuble information for those seeking to find a path. It also contains glossary of herbs, stones, animals and other substances that I found to be very useful. This book also has a series of spells and incantations that the average person seeking to try witchcraft might not be able do considering that the ingredients calls for things that one may not have or be able to find. Even then I really like this book and recomend it to one who wants to learn a little more about witchcraft."
1,A glorious promise gone awry,"Oh, if only the Digisette worked as promised! The engineering is SHODDY. and unfortunately, it's not even predictable: sometimes digisette kills my other USB devices (mouse); sometimes it doesn't. sometimes the software connects to the device; sometimes it doesn't (i think this may have something to do with whether the battery has registered a charge). sometimes the rewind/ff work; sometimes they don't. sadly enough, i have to give this a NO. it's just too terribly frustrating, and i'm a gadget-lover."
4,well it's good and bad,"first off i hate this whole empty box with 1 dvd idea and the pricing is stupid....this is one series that might actually sound better in english...the story sems to take place in the future and everything is pretty much westernized, but all their mannerisms r extremely japanese... the first episode is completely boring and does not spark any interest for me to continue watchin... but i did... thru the flashbacks, the story gets to take on a lot of depth, it follows the lives of these characters thru decades... and it was very surprisingly good, the character and plot development... but since this series is based off a videogame, a lot of its depth and thoughtfulness is undercut by fights that seems completely ridiculous and videogame like... overall it's nicely done series...but i hate the outrageous prices of the american licensed anime dvds"
3,Maybe Vol. 2 will be better...,"Maybe it's just me, but when I see an ad for an Anime DVD with a big gun-toting badass on the cover, I expect to see him in more than one out of four episodes on the DVD.Gungrave Vol. 1 'Beyond the Grave' would have been more aptly titled 'BEFORE the Grave' since it only involves one episode of 'Gungrave action' and three episodes of young Brandon Heat fist fighting in the streets of...wherever.Don't get me wrong, the Anime looked good. The dialog was decent, with the exception of the main character who didn't have any. It was a quality DVD, just not what I was hoping for after reading the back of the box.Perhaps Vol. 2, due at the end of Sept., will get back to the Brandon After Death (or B.A.D.) character that all of the ads are talking about...but I doubt it. At the end of the fourth episode, prospects of getting out of the character history flashback did not look good."
4,Guilty Pleasure,Good CD with interesting songs. One wonders why Greg only gets to sing only one song during a Clark concert. As good as almost anything on any Clarks CD which is pretty good indeed.
5,heavy duty,"Seems like it could run power tools, much heavier construction than needed for wallwarts and it looks ugly with 4 of them hanging off it behind my laptop but it's doing the job well and none have slipped loose so five stars."
2,"Satisfying, but not stuffing","Long time personal heroes of mine Quintron and Miss P bring another fun offering. If you're familiar with past works, you're in for a nice reprise of their signature sound. Songs on the album don't seem as clever or catchy to me as usual, although phenomenal songs like ""Swamp Buggy Baddass"", ""Love is Like a Blob"" and Kiss cover ""God of Thunder"" deserve a place on a Quintron best of album, if one where ever to be made."
4,Just a Krooked Kid,"After doing an Amazon search of the word ""arthrogryposis"", I found Goodwin Hale's book. I am a mother of a son with this condition and so I was interested in reading about Mr. Hale's life. His story is really inspirational and I was constantly stopping to read my husband excerpts from this book. The writing is lively and he has many amusing antecdotes about his growing up years. I am anxious to have my son read it. He is 15 and I think he will be able to relate to Mr. Hale's stories, although he did not grow up in a small town during the depression as Mr. Hale did. Despite the generational difference, his daily life as someone with arthrogryposis will be familiar to anyone with this condition. I would highly recommend his book for anyone with a loved one with this condition- they will be inspired by Mr. Hale. I would also recommend this book to anyone who just wants a positive read, many smiles and inspiration of someone that had difficult challenges from birth."
2,dissapointed,dnt get me wrong but i love equipto. I think he is a solid mc but when he is with nickatina he is unstoppable.In horns and halo series he blue me away. dnt really care to much for this cd.but if you a fan of equipto you should get.thats why i got it.wish it would be better.
4,Nice,"this video has a nice flow to it, and has excellent progression with linking the parts together as you go along...you also get a cd with the music used in the video"
3,"Practical, but uninspiring","This is a decent book describing the basics of 50 different hikes. The book has two pages of text plus a small map of each hike. The text tells you how long the hike is, provides basic driving directions, and indicates whether the hike is rocky or wet. However, I felt uninspired after reading about the hikes. I was left wondering whether it was really worth a two hour drive for some of these out of the way hikes.The author does not present this book as the 50 best hikes, only as a list of 50 decent hikes. I would have liked to see color photos, better maps, a better list of what to look for on the hikes, rankings of the most enjoyable hikes, and a numerical rating of aspects such as rockiness, steepness, and wetness, so I could better determine how certain age groups would fair on the hikes."
4,Pretty good,"Mostly a very good resource. Speaking on a pure scenic level, the author shows you some fantastic views and pretty trails. However, he fails to tell you sometimes when the trail is incredibly rocky or steep. Overall, though, definately worth the money"
3,Good Resource,"This is an good book describing several trails in the area. Some of the trail descriptions are a bit on the short side, but overall it does a good job locating overlooks and trail descriptions.The only thing I could suggest is setting up a website to go along with this book. Something that could keep track of errata and trail conditions along with a messageboard and such. The first time I used this book, we did hike #6, the Maple Run Trail and found out that the book says to go out 2.8 miles out Maple Run Road for the trailhead, but in reality, it is only 1.3 miles. We lost a day of hiking because of the error. If there was an easy way to monitor such errata, it would help."
3,"Good but not ""The Burglar""","I read a lot of Lawrence Block's Burglar books. This Thief book has some nice moments, but it does not have the wit and humor of the various Burglar capers. Maybe the Tanner books got better as they went along, but I've read only the first one."
4,It's a fast read,"Lawrence Block has several characters that we can follow through those series. The Evan Tanner books are earlier works (except for ""Tanner on Ice"") and he got better as he got older. If you are expecting Tanner to be a Bernie Rhodenbarr, you will be in for a disappointment. This book is enjoyable fantasy and comedy about super spies employed by secret agencies of the USA.Block is literate and has a lot of wry humor throughout the book. Like his earlier works, starring Chip Harrison, his main character always has these gorgeous nymphomaniacs who have to bed him repeatedly. For the men who are still emotionally 14 years old, this part will appeal to them. For the rest of us, it is only comedy. Evan Tanner is able to pull a scam on the criminals who intend to cut him out of his reward, and the way he does it is appealing.It's a good read and a fast one, too."
1,Total piece of (junk),This device has been an utter dissapointment from the day I got it. (...) It is almost totally useless for playing audio books. None of the the controls work as advertised. It periodically resets to the beginning of the mp3 file and there is no way to fast forward or skip back to where you were. You can't play it in a cassette player with the power adaptor connected. The battery won't stay charged and the connectors are very flimsey. Digisette should be embarrased for releasing this abomination on the public.
1,Junk...junk...junk,"Although I have owned this device [including one replacement] for about a year, I have NEVER been able to successfully download content from audible.com. The ONLY success was playing the content which Audible itself downloaded to the replacement unit before sending it to me. I have spent ENDLESS hours online with Audible, etc. all to no avail. They remain stumped. [And I am not exactly a novice at all this stuff.]Although the Audible people have been pleasant, I have found them ultimately unreliable [for example, I was told a tech supervisor would call me back the following day...when she didn't, I emailed her ... I got a ""response"" from her saying she was off sick that day but would get back to me immediately on her return to the office ... that was last June ... apparently she is still sick]."
4,Great tool for commuters,"I read a few of the reviews before buying. I agree with the other reviewers, the power switch is the Achilles heel of this product. All in all, a very useful device for listening to audio books while driving. Audible.com is a great resource to take advantage of the DUO-64."
3,Works with cassette decks with seek function,"When I tried this player in my car the first time, I advanced to the next track by using the FF button per manufacturer's directions and noticed that it only advanced a few seconds into the song. Since my deck also had a music seek system which allows me to advance to the next song on a cassette with the touch of a button, I pressed the FWD seek then PLAY just to see what would happen and voila, it advanced to the next song. On another deck without the music seek function, there was no way to jump from one track to another without popping it out of the deck. The inability to skip between tracks is one MAJOR complaint about this product but I found a way around it. Other than that, it's acceptable though overpriced.There's a lot of room for improvement on this mp3 player, I would either wait for another product to come out similar to this or hope that Digisette will improve on some of the pet peeves mentioned by other buyers."

4,Great for sunshine and parties,"This artist was recommended by Ina Garten, guest writer for Bon Appetit, October/11 issue. I'll collect Costes La suite music in the future."
2,Cesaria Fans Stay away as far as you can,"I am giving 2 stars only because I immensely adore Cesaria Evora.Magical voice, terrible compilation.Normally you buy very best albums because you don't want to pay top dollars for regular albums that have 2-3 good songs with filler for rest. This time it is the opposite. This compilation has only 2 of her best songs, the rest is so-so.You will be much better off if you buy her regular albums such as:So VicenteCafe Atlanticowhich are highly recommended.This said Cesaria Evora must be part of your life experience.Imagine the Very Best of Beatles without Yesterday.P.S. Just in case you are wondering which ones are the 2 songs worthy of a CD with a name Very Best, here they are:03. Carnaval De Sao Vicente13. Esperance Irisada"
3,Be careful!,"Good music, indeed, but be careful. I would recommed her ""Anthologie: Mornas & Coladeras"" (double CD) better."
3,20 years Narada Piano and artists,"This is a 2 CD set with a number of different artists and some delightful, original music on it. I found it pleasant, restful, relaxing - no surprises, more like unobtrusive background music. Judy. 20th November 2006"
5,"A ""must-read"" for anyone seeking to pursue higher education","The Social Work Graduate School Applicant's Handbook: The Complete Guide To Selecting And Applying to MSW Programs by Jesus Reyes (Director of the Social Service Department of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and former Assistant Dean for Enrollment at the University of Chicago School for Social service Administration) is a direct, comprehensive, and thoroughly ""user friendly"" guide to preparing effective social work graduate school applications. From searching out the best schools, to what schools look for among the applications submitted to them, to an extensive selection of research resources, The Social Work Graduate School Applicant's Handbook is a ""must-read"" for anyone seeking to pursue higher education in dynamic social work field and to secure their MSW or a social work doctorate."
2,A compendium of papers,"This book is a selection of papers that deals with the basic principles of power electronics and drives. The idea was not to give a definitive and unified treatise on the subject. It is instead a collection of papers for the practitioner and the novice to gain some understanding of the basis of the ideas behind drives and power electronics by reading the original papers written by the original researchers. These papers are considered to be definitive in the mind of the editor. If you need a complete guide to the analysis of power electronic circuits and drives, this is not the book. I would recommend Principles of Power Electronics by Kassakian et. al. or Power electronics: Converters, Applications and Design, by Mohan et.al.This book is more for the graduate student or the researcher who needs to read the original work in order to move along in their research. This is not for the practically minded trouble shooter or the designer."
2,AN ACADEMIC TREATISE,"If you are trying to learn about varible frequency drives or how to build them look elsewhere. If you are willing to spend hours looking for a small piece of practical information, this book MIGHT have it. Dicussion of topics is not conducive to an intuitive understanding of the subject."
2,Not quite there,"The text has some useful attributes, namely lists of references and wide range of coverage. The problem is that detail is lacked in some of the coverage. Some of the chapters are a bit self-serving to the authors of those chapters. The referenced papers at the end are predominantly papers written by the authors themselves. Seems to not acknowledge techniques and ideas other than their own."
2,Blood Covenant- well-researched but WAY too long,"Checking in at 400+ pages, Blood Covenant displays well the author's meticulous research; however, it would benefit dramatically from a hard edit. On the plus side, the characters in the story seem believable for the most part and the story does unfold in a reasonably cohesive manner, something that is not always the case with this genre. However, the suspense of the story is muted by the novel's ponderous length and its author's periodic forays into biblical/political posturing.On the whole, however, Blood Covenant is a good first effort and it will be interesting to see what the author does next."
1,Not Worth The Paper It's Printed On,"I thought this book was trash! I have been studying the CW (particularly Antietam and Gettysburg) for about 30 years and this is one of the worst ""modern"" books on the CW I have come across. The author presents his opinions, often without adequate doumentation. He simply presents something as ""fact"" by stating that ""that is how it must have been"". End of argument. For a ""beginner"" on CW history, I can see this book's appeal, since it tells things simply and confirms all of the popular myths. But the more well-read CW buff should come away shaking his head. Today, there are numerous books on the market that go to great lengths to document, using multiple sources, what they present. This is NOT such a book; I would not rely on anything I read in it. Buy some other book on Gettysburg - this one just doesn't cut it!"
5,A Sense of Wonder,"Excellent condition, prompt delivery. I would definitely use this service again. I wish they had a second copy of this book so I could order one for myself!"
4,A Fast read,"I first read this book at the suggestion of a friend, and it was the first time I ever read anything by this author. I much prefer her short stories, and some of her other characters over Amanda. Amanda can be over-the-top in some ways, and at times I felt like I just wanted to slap her!But, I found I couldn't put the book down and I loved Gilchrist's skill in evoking a sense of place -- both New Orleans and Fayetteville, Arkansas. I've been to both places and Gilchrist manages to capture the ""feel"" of both towns.The ending is sad, but interestingly, in one of her later short story collections -- I think it's ""The Age of Miracles"" -- Gilchrist writes a short story that is a different ending to this book. And that ending I would have liked better!"
3,Good performances...ethics be damned,"The issue of leaking information to the press has been around for years, and this film does its best to illustrate how badly it can backfire when the sources aren't properly checked and re-checked.Having said that, and being a journalist myself, I just want to shoot Sally Field for her gross violations of journalist ethics. Getting involved with the subject? No how, no way. It just isn't done. If you can accept this HUGE leap of journalistic and editorial faith, then the rest of the movie is a breeze.Aside from Newman, I think the best performance in the movie is one of the briefest...Wilford Brimley as the U.S. Attorney who gets to the bottom of the mess. It's just a pleasure to watch him go through the paces of tearing Bob Balaban's little vendetta all to pieces, and to experience his grudging approval to let Newman walk."
5,Just a really good movie,"I can watch this flick over and over. Wilford Brimley completely steals the film when he comes in near the end, but the rest of the movie is great without him.The mom from A Christmas Story is simply fantastic. Sally Field is very good. Paul Newman is what you expect... world class. Bob Balaban is great. Smarmy.There are two scenes that are among my favorites of any scenes in any movie. One is with Sally and Paul. The other is with Melinda Dillon (mom from Christmas Story).See this movie."
3,Makes a good Christmas gift,I gave this as a holiday gift for a family member. It's a classic and they seemed to enjoy it.
5,ABSENCE OF MALICE!,"SEE the star of ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""The Sting"" attack the star of ""Gidget"" and ""The Flying Nun!"" in this CRITICAL EXAMINATION of the FOURTH ESTATE! Is PAUL NEWMAN involved with organized crime or is he AN INNOCENT MAN? Does journalist SALLY FIELD care about the TRUTH or just getting the STORY? Written by former reporter KURT LUETKE, enjoy this study of the POWER and PRIVILEGE of the PRESS! SEE Wilford Brimley come in at the end and put everybody in their place! Another social commentary film from director SYDNEY POLLACK!"
3,A mildly pleasant way to spend an evening,"This movie depends for its climax upon Paul Newman's tricking the other people in the movie. Other than that, there's little drama in the movie. The affair between Newman and Field is not credible, nor is the incident in which Newman throws Field on the floor and rips her blouse, yet she does not report him to the police. The acting and pacing are good, if unexceptional."
1,Snoozefest,Wilford Brimley is very good in this film but that is about all it has going for it. I found it to be a great cure for insominia.
5,My Favorite Paul Newman Movie,"This is a movie I can watch over and over again. I never get tired of it. Just writing this review makes me want see it right now. It is a very powerful story about how the press can ruin peoples lives without being absolutely sure they are printing the truth and how they can be manipulated into furthering someone elses agenda regardless of how accurate the story they have been fed really is. The scene with Wilford Brimley is worth buying the movie for. I think my favorite line from him is ""the last time there was leak this big,Noah had to build himself a boat"". Great story and great acting."
5,"Great Course, Good Teacher","This book is a full university course in Tibetan Buddhism--its roots, its heroes, its evolving schools, and its spiritual practice as the wayfarer experiences it. Ray is a patient, passionate teacher who takes time to clearly explain the pathways and peaks of Buddhist philosophy and practice. I'd definitely recommend it for any student of the subject.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"
3,shallow,"Both books are verbose, repetitive and don't explain much. The little information they contain could be transmitted in 1/8 of their size."
5,Interenational Techno/Terror Thriller,"I personally will guarantee this to be one of the very best 'reads' of the year. Jeff's characters are interesting, believable, and well developed, the plot while complex, is nicely detailed. The locations, mainly Belize and Silicon Valley, are very well researched. You will truly enjoy this fine book, I read the 413 pages in a day and a half, couldn't put the book down.."
5,Perimiter by Jeff Foster,"As international action,intrigue thrillers go this one rates very high.It is a compelling read, keeping you on the edge wanting more as the story developes. Truly a book that once started is very hard to put down and definitely one you will be disappointed to finish."
4,Do you have metatarsalgia?,"I was side-lined for several months because of intense metatarsal pain (metatasalgia). The high metatarsal pad on this product is unlike any other and was very helpful in helping me to heal from the pain. They are expensive and not very soft, but I have not found anything like them on the market. Now I am back to my high intensity running (street and treadmill), and I'm back at Barry's Bootcamp -- so I am grateful."
5,Can't make it work with XP,"It runs fine on Windows 9x, but I just can't make it work on XP. I can't fault the product or MS for this. It won't install properly even using the Compatibility mode options in XP."
3,Poor Pacing,"Lesson of the Harvest has many stories that just begin and end. The pacing of the plot is poor. This could have been an excellent book, but needed more details with better pacing to make a ""book"" not just 'stories'."
5,"A rich, sweeping description of an era","""Lessons of the Heart"" is a rich, sweeping description of an era whose ""roots"" scan and empower the very essence of every reader's character. Mattie McCarey's personal triumph and tragedies reach from the backwoods of Georgia to every nation that reflects the ""truth that sets all men free...""(...)"
5,Masterful playing!!,"Some fantastic music on this CD. I play euphonium, and the Pantomime and Cosma are wonderful pieces. The playing of the Flight of the Bumble Bee is truely amazing and some beautiful melodies. Great choice!"
1,Not even for light duty,"Paid $150 at Tracor Supply and I'm hoping to recover $75 by selling it on craiglist less than a year later.Pros:CheapCons:Ridiculously hard to startChain will not stay tight (and the nuts that have to be wrenched to tighten it will not take a socket because the plastic cover is poorly designed and in the way)Chain dulls after 30 minutes of useHolds only about a cup of gas so it only runs for about 15 minutes before refillI only needed a light duty saw for felling the occasional tree and cutting it up for the camp fire, but this saw is not even suitable for that. If you can only afford $150 for a chain saw, try to borrow one instead. With this thing you will be out $150 and still needing to spend $300 on a usable tool."
3,Light cutting only!!,"I just bought this saw, it started and ran fine. I took it the wood pile out back to try it out; it cut the smaller pieces alright but when I introduced it to a larger cut of wood (14"" dia. pine), it just didn't have the power to go through. It bogged down and did not perform at all.I then proceeded to drain the oil and gas and take it back as it is not suitable for my needs.For light use, I think this saw would probably suffice. For anything above light use, you may consider investing the money in a more substantial saw......which coinicidently is what I'm going to have to do."
3,"Poulan P4018 18"" Chainsaw just OK, not great","I've had this Poulan P4018 18"" Chainsaw for about 5 years and cut firewood and do brush clearing chores with it. It works great with firewood logs, but on small woody brush and briars the chain snags and jumps off the drive sprocket often. Definitely not suitable for clearing brush, saplings, and briars. I suspect that there is a design flaw in mine involving the drive sprocket. Maybe that's been corrected with newer models ? However, it runs nicely all day on larger firewood logs, easy starting, fairly low gas consumption, low vibration fatigue, not as noisy as some. I would not recommend mine due to the problem with the chain coming off the sprocket in small brush."
5,Block Buster,"Hey my Daddy says ""To the new users of chainsaws.The Poulan wild thing is the real deal. ""It is easy to start, lite to handle and can cut clean and quick.Usually I do not rate products however, this equipment works."
1,awful product,"Plastic everything. Console broke when I tightened screw. Chain bar needs constant adjustment. Starter cord often jams and you have to take it apart to free the cord. Rarely starts cold. Chain kicks off all the time, as the bar does not hold steady. Choke slips and does not hold position at full and half choke. This is the epitome of cheap junk thrown together. I have spent more time fixing and trying to start this piece of junk than I have cutting. This is a cheap saw but adds credence to the ole saying: ""penny wise and pound foolish."""
1,totally dissatisfied owner,"I received the Poulan P4018WT ""Wild Thing"" gas chainsaw as a gift last Christmas and have used it a total of 10 times, the reason being it WON'T START most of the time! This is the hardest starting gas chainsaw I have ever used. It was obviously cheaply made. Poulan should be ashamed. DON'T waste your money on this piece of junk!!"
1,Junk - Don't Purchase It,"Well, you get what you pay for. And if you pay for this Poulan ""Wild Thing"" you are buying frustration and little else. This saw cuts well . . . when you can start it and keep it running. Just don't try to restart it when it is warm. You have to wait a couple hours until it cools down completely. The choke won't stay in place. The idle screw does not hold - I have to continuously adjust the idle. The chain/bar oil plug vibrated loose. I lost the plug, oil spilled all over my pants leg and boot. The replacement plug I ordered from Poulan cost a fortune. The fuel tank only holds enough gasoline for, at most, 15 minutes of cutting (if you can get the saw started in the first place) and then you have to wait a couple hours until the engine completely cools before you can restart it. Don't buy this product. Shame on Poulan for marketing such junk. And they call it the Poulan ""Easy Start"" chainsaw!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"I recently bought this from a local hardware store. Initially, I was very pleased with it. I had no problems with starting the saw and it felt good ergonomically. After using it a couple of times, I had plenty of problems with the chain coming off. I keep having to adjust the chain, put the chain back on, etc... This last weekend, I somehow jammed up the cylinder so the sprocket won't even turn. I ended up using a bow saw; it took about the same time. Next time, I will spend the extra money for a good saw (Stihl, Husky, etc.)."
2,"Hard starting, otherwise runs good.","Idles nicely, but is very hard to start when the engine is cold! Needs to be primed multiple times between attempts. Very frustrating, especially in the fall abd winter when then engine cools back down even while refueling."
1,A Piece Of Crap,Don't waste your money on the Poulan Wild Thing. It won't idle well and has to be restarted constantly. Forget trying to use it off the ground on a ladder. It has to be started and restarted just like it has a cold engine each time. Believe me it is so complicated to start you will wish you had never purchased it. I only give this product a one because I can't go any lower and still write a review.
3,Decent saw,"I have owned a wild thing for 2 years now. The only major downfall that i have is its lack of power. I dropped mine down to a 16"" bar which helped it out alot. So my advise is if you are planing to use this saw quite often as in my case to cut firewood every fall. Dont buy it go with a stihl or a husky. They will serve you much better!! as i am looking for a better one now!"
5,wild thing,Good name for the saw.wild thing run's great.It cut's very good and handles very well.especially for the price you can't beat it.I love mine
4,Tough for the price!,"I love this saw! I have owned or used many different brands through the years (Homelite, Poloun, Husqvarna) and have been hard on all of them. I was strapped for cash, but thought the investment in a saw and sweat would be better than the price of wood for a winter. I live in the mountains of California and last winter was WET! I used this saw in what I consider adverse conditions (cool and wet)and my only complaint was the pullcord slipping from the sprocket on occasion. It starts without hesitation and I've had NO issue with the chain. After each use, I clean it up (removing bar and chain), give the chain a quick file upon reassembly, and I'm ready to sweat some more! I'm starting earlier this year cutting wood for winter and it's given me no trouble in the summer heat."
1,Worst tool of mine ever,"I bought this chainsaw at Home Depot in 2006 on a black Friday sale for $100. After using it for ten minutes, the starter mechanism crapped out. Sometimes it helps to knock on it but most of the time I have to take that part apart to make it usable anymore. After about an hour of use the carburetor died. A plug inside the carb came out and it could not be fixed. I ordered a brand new carburetor for it but it still does not run. STAY AWAY from this tool!"
1,Not as shown!!,The pictures are not the actual flag! The actual flag is horrible quality. Mine arrived dirty already when it was supposed to be new! DO NOT ORDER THIS ONE!!!
1,"Terrible, bad customer service, very rude...",As everybody below this review has mentioned. I ordered 12 flags & the photos and description do NOT represent what was sent to me. I expected embroided flags and instead received printed ones. When I contacted customer service and asked them to send the ones that I ordered and was willing to keep the ones that they sent. I was insulted by them saying what do you expect for your money? Great customer service? I don't think so!! What a joke...
2,Not great quality,"The size of the flag is fine, but the quality is cheap. I thought the stars were stitched but they are not. The flag is thin and will not last very long."
2,Deceiving,"The flag received is not the flag from the majority of the pictures. There is a picture zoomed in to show a nicely stitched star, however the flag i received is a a thin flag with printed stars and stripes. The flag is still a good deal for less than $5, but clearly not the flag that is shown in the pictures."
2,pictures do not match product,this flag was very cheap for good reason. I asked an employee to puchase a new flag for in front of our store. they bought this based on the pic but were con cerned by the price(to low). when it arrived I had to throw it away. thin nylon. not something you would display with any pride.
1,Junk made in China,Buy a flag made in the US. Why are we supporting China? Would you be proud to fly the communist flags?
2,American Flag,This flag was disappointing. It is thin and not of the unusual pattern pictured. I doubt if I will display it; will probably donate it.
2,It's worth what you paid for it.,"I thought, what kind of flag can you get for only $5, including shipping? The answer is, not much of one. It's printed on lightweight polyester and good for maybe one Fourth of July. On the other hand, if you need a very inexpensive flag for a one-time use, this is it. Like a lot of buyers, I thought Iwas getting a really super deal, and I was very disappointed by what I actually got- but I really should have known better. There is, after all, no such thing as a free lunch ;-)"
1,Decieved,"These are very poor quality flags! The pictures they use to represent them are in no way pictures of the actual flags. I was very disappointed in them and even more disappointed in the way i was treated when i tried to return them (still trying).The company was rude when they answered my e-mail, and the whole experience has left me questioning whether or not i will continue to do business on Amazon."
1,Poor quality,"Very disappointed. The grommets pulled out after 4 days on my flag pole. The flag was taken down each evening and the weather was good, no heavy winds. The stitching around the flag is very loose and although I have restitched the grommets back on the flag, I would be surprised if I get two more weeks of life out of it. You get what you pay for. The images for the item are also not of the flag received. I would think that qualifies as false advertising."
3,Used.... I didn't know that,When i bought it it didn't say that these were used...... well i guess thats why they were so cheap
3,Good rpice,"I was hoping it would have been more ""sturdy'. I hope it lasts as long as my last one lasted."
3,you can't expect much for $4,"I bought this flag to hang on a wall, and it's perfect for that. The colors are vibrant, but they are printed. The only issue is the patch of fabric where the grommets are sewn on. I wouldn't expect this part to hold for more than 5 minutes. I would not buy this flag to hang outdoors, it will be destroyed quickly. But if you intend to hang it inside on a wall, it's perfect."
2,"Too transparent and sheer, will not hold up in wind.",This flag is very thin and transparent. It will not last long in the wind. You can see right through the flag. I would send it back if it didn't cost as much to send it back as the flag cost. The only way this flag is useful is if it is hung on a wall then it would look good and last much longer. Don't buy this flag if you want to fly it outside in the wind.
4,Satisfactory,"This is a good flag for the money. I have it hanging in my dorm and it looks good. Bright color, good stitching, light weight."
2,not reel thing,American Flag Superknit Polyester 3ft x 5ft with Grommetsnot reel thing you can't use it for the outdoors I don't like it
1,Poor product,I was very disappointed to find these were printed/painted on material flags. They would never hold up on my flagpole for even a short time.
1,DECEIVED by the photo's showing the detail,"DECEIVED and would not recommend buying this product. They used FALSE ADVERTISEING to sell. The flag is cheap cheap cheap. The birds sing their song every morning. CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP! I contacted seller and his reply was, ""these are the flags you paid 4 dollars for right? return them. They aren't even worth my time sending back. They got what they wanted, money, but I won't buy ANYTHING from them again. EVER.....and if you are SMART you won't either.American Flag Superknit Polyester 3ft x 5ft with Grommets"
1,conned,"The American flag I bought was not at all what was represented. The description said that it had individually sewn together stripes and embroidered stars. All this was false. It was just printed on plastic, which has faded within the first two weeks after hanging, the red stripes are now pink and the blue is a faint blue at best. Very poor quality. I bought it through Amazon, from a third party seller."
3,Flag,"We like the flag. Nice for the price. Will unfurl easily in the wind and looks fine from both sides contrary to another review which said it was printed on one side. Perhaps, but it looks just fine on both sides. Have not flown it yet, have another we bought at the same time and are using it first."
1,SCAM,"what a SCAM, nothing else needs to be said about this cheap printed (not embroidered) flag! this is just a cheap printed on flag, nothing more, nothing less. as a member of the Military i was ashamed when i saw these flags!"
1,Junk and made in China,Who wants an AMERICAN flag made in China? I sure as hell don't!!!Take it back. Don't buy this flag!
5,GREAT FLAG,I LIKE THE AMERICAN FLAG FOR THE PRIDE IT REPRESENTS. IF I CAN GET A FLAG FO OUT FRONT AT A LOW PRICE I WILL REPLACE IT WITH THIS ONE EVERY TIME. I LIKE THE QUALITY.
1,Pictures lie!,I was not impressed when this delivery showed up. I looked at the pictures and they clearly show a different product that is all nylon with stiched stars. When i purchased the product i did not read the description closely and focused more on the pictures. BIG MISTAKE! The description is the product I got but the pictures are FALSE ADVERTISING! I will never purchase another product from this dishonest company again.
4,As advertised,Good fabric and the price is right. Do not know if it will fade. Would buy it again without doubt.
2,american flag,its polyester. price was great. color fades fairly quickly-in about 2-3 months of outside usage.not made in the USA...
5,flags,I was very happy with my flags. The price and quality was perfect for me. I will order again when I need one
5,"Writes are Made, not Born","The great take-away from Maughan's fascinating autobiography is this simple fact. Maughan states flatly that he had to ""learn how to write"". The admission that when he started he could hardly string together a coherent sentence - is revelatory. And this coming from a writer who by many accounts was the highest paid writer of his time clearly puts to rest the nonsense that ""writers-are-born"".Storytelling is a craft, like any other profession, and it can and must be learned.W. Sumerset Maughan's ""The Summing Up"" clearly delineates this simple but all important fact for writers. And although critics derided his simple style the public of book buyers clearly appreciated his clarity.The story, after all is said and done, is what people buy. And people buy the books, not critics."
5,"Fast read, great mystery!",Another intriguing plot with a fantastic character! It's fun to learn a little feng shui while reading a great story.Loved this book--rich characters and exciting mystery!
5,Highly recommended.,"I read this book as a schoolboy back in 1978 and recently went over parts of it. It is a great and profound book from a champion thinker. The exposition of Steinitz's ideas is superb. The English prose is a bit dated, but it is also part of the charm of this book. This book is real chess literature - not like those senseless opening monographs!"
3,A Classis Which Needs Updating and Notation Change,"This wonderful classic is very well written for an adult (would be difficult reading for most kids) who is either a beginner or a player who has aquired basic skills. It provides a good mixture of basics with even some more advanced concepts. Lasker was a great chess teacher.Then why 3 stars instead of 5? This is because the book requires some serious updating. For the more advanced player the openings are very outdated. The book needs to be written in the more modern and efficient Algebraic form of notation. And, as already mentioned, it is difficult reading for possible use by a young reader."
3,baxic,"its pretty basic stuff allthough its good for beginners, if you dont know the rules of chess completly!! anyone who knows will win over you, like u have to know about tactics snd this book is a good starting poiny...."
4,we've all been there...,"Michael Coulombe captures the deepest of raw emotions in words that flow like silk.We've all been there-dealt with loss, issues of social sensitivity, joy and epiphanies.One can't help but think as you read...with accord...yes...yes...Storms are best navigated with friends.Enjoy.Regan DuCasse"
3,It LOOKS cool,"Nifty little gadget for the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Pocket, but the glare on the Gameboy screen from the light is somewhat annoying.....still, I bought two more for nephew/niece since it looks cool!"
1,Useless piece of junk! Can't see the game when using it,I paid $8 at gamestop for this garbage to use with my new fucia GBA. The light is so close and bright that all you see on the screen is a huge glare of light. Can't see the game. Don't buy this one! I would gladly pay another $100 for a backlit system to avoid having to use these crummy accesories.
4,So-So,This is a really nice idea but it's not nice enough. The only problem is that it blocks the screen. It has really nice lighting.I rate the visiblity of the screen when it's on 3 out of 5. I rate the lighting 5 out of 5. So on the whole I rate it 4 out of 5.
1,Steer clear of this spotlight!,"This light is concentrated to one area of the screen, it is so bright you can't even see the game you're playing! The one thing that is good about it is it requires no external power source. Furthermore, it works better just as a flashlight. A flashlight and the worm light both can blind you if you stare directly at them for long enough!"
4,Very good accessory,"The worm light is a very good accessory due to fact that no unecessary shadows are cast over the game boy screen. This device also uses the game link port on the game boy color so extra batteries are not needed. I can fit the worm light into my gameboy case without a problem because it is so compact. To all parents that are looking for something for their childs game boy, buy this because it is convenient for them and it is not budget busting either"
5,good light,"This is really good accessory to have for your Game Boy. The best thing about it you don't need to buy batteries for it all the time and never have to change the light source. It lights up the face of the Game Boy in any darkness. In fact, you can also use it as a flash light. The only thing I don't like is the glare of the light on the screen, but you can change the postion to reduce the glare. Over all it's great for all Game Boy players."
5,great light!!,This is a great light for gameboy!I use to get mad because I couldn't see the screen at night on the road and try to use street lights to see which was not fun or easy!But once i got this I could see it with out any trouble or without my mom and dad telling me to shut the light off. the best part is that it doesnt use up battery!!!! Well any way thanks to whom ever made this!!
5,fun,this light is super cool its small it dosent need its own battries you just hook it up to your GBC and you dont need to replace the bulb and when you hook it up to your GBC you can ajust it to however you are comfortable with and no matter how dark it is it will always light up your screen really good your GBC is never complete without on of these you wont be disapointed if you buy it.
1,"Neat idea, if it worked.","I never use my WormLight, because it doesn't illuminate the entire screen adequately, nor is it bright enough. I prefer a floor lamp. The Wormlight is cheap, so it isn't a huge waste of money if you don't like it. If you can try one out first, however, you should."
1,lame,"i requested to cancel to a product a purchase, and the company never replied back to me to cancel it, and it took money out of my bank account,im reporting to to higher grounds because i dont like what's happening, or finding other means to deal with this problem, this is poor customer service, and i feel i got cheated out of my money, i believe i sent the email 2 days ago to have what i order cancel and i never got a reply...."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM COLLECTORSCARDSANDGAMES,"I ordered a purple Worm Light back In September 2010 From the seller ""collectorscardsandgames"", Amazon advertised it as a nyko worm light, Instead what i got was a Innovation Brand Worm light that had a yellow bulb that made the colors on the screen look black and white, So i emailed him, and he says he sells them regardless of brand, So my advice is DO NOT buy from collectorscardsandgames. He did fraud on us"
3,Pretty Useful,"This light is a good alternative to bulkier Game Boy lights, but it does cause a lot of glare if bent at the wrong angle, and isn't that great for playing in total darkness. It is, however, good for making gameplay a bit less painful on the eyes in dimly lit rooms."
3,Wormie,"It's a clever little thing, to be sure - with no extra batteries, it just plugs into the Game Boy. On the other hand, the Game Boy screen is designed to be highly reflective (in order to bounce as much light as possible back into your eyes), and holding a light above it results in the light being reflected into your face. This is why laptops and so forth are lit from behind the screen. There isn't much you can do about glare - if you hold the light at an angle, or far enough away for the reflection to be diffuse, it doesn't illuminate the screen properly. On the good side, you can eventually get used to it, and it is eventually possible to arrange the stalk so that it works well, and if you have to use the Game Boy in low-light conditions there isn't really any alternative. It's also amazingly cheap - perhaps if they had placed a filter of some kind over the light, it would be better."
5,exciting medieval adventure,"I have had the pleasure to meet this author in person, and read this book while still in formation. Ms. Stratton is an up-and-coming new author who, in my opinion, will take the historical market by storm. LADY KNIGHT is the first of a trilogy, and will keep you wanting for the next book. Her writing is fresh, not corny and mushy, like most historicals on the open market. It is definately not a ""cookie cutter"" romance. Her historical facts are correct, and her style is humorous, page turning. I highly recommend this book."
1,Lady Knight,This book is [bad] for four year olds to eight year olds. There is sex in it for heavens sake! I'm eleven years old and I bought this book because you said it was ok for four to eight year olds. I was very upset when I read the sexual stuff at the end. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!
5,Wayward Ways!,"Wow... I just finished this lovely piece of work! I found it through recommendations Amazon provided and by reading the reviews provided I knew I would enjoy it immensely and I was not let down!Okay here is my blurb on the story:Pet has lost her twin and the rest of her family at the hands of raiders and she is doing everything she can to bring justice... however, she is befuddled in her quest by the wayward actions of a particular handsome King's Knight. Matthew can think of nothing else but to make Pet his even at her expense.If you loved Tamora Pierce's work, but also enjoy more intense romance you will love this book! Just read it and learn few things not to perform in front of the person you are trying to woo, such as accidentally ripping off her garments before you realize she is indeed a woman!"
1,Awful stories.,"Only one or two of these stories were even worth reading. ""Goldilocks and the Three Barons"" was just plain stupid. Very little of any of this book drew you in. I would definately pass on it."
3,Not the best collection of erotic bedtime stories,"I read Fairy Tale Lust a few months ago and enjoyed it, so I figured I'd give a different erotica collection a chance. Sadly, this collection was not as good as the other one I read. I felt that some of the stories were not as well written or that the story had been done better by someone else. Some of the problems for me included no build up to the sex or the fact that sex didn't feel consual, or that the characters were poor done and that prevented me from caring about what was happening.I enjoyed the first couple of stories but the stories later on were flat, they lacked a spark I felt the other earlier stories had or the stories I read in the other erotica collection. I also thought it was very odd to have two of the same retellings right next to each other (it was either that they were right next to each other or only one story inbetween).While there were some good things in this, for the most part, I wasn't impressed. 3 Stars."
2,Badly written,"The anthology is a good idea, albeit one done before, but the problem is that the stories are simply badly written. For example, the first story, a retelling of Beauty & The Beast, reads like a lawyer wrote it. The language reads very clinical. It feels like reading stereo instructions and when it does leap into more erotic story telling, the prose is juvenile. I found that most of the stories are this way- at least unsophisticated.I did not find any of the stories ""erotic."" I thought the authors were too worried about their stories being ""porn"" that they forgot to make it sexy."
3,Sometimes Enchanted,This book of short stories uses fairy tales as a starting point. Some take you on an erotic journey while others feel more like the author's commentary on how women are diminished by society. I had hoped for more depth in the stories but the short story format did not allow for that. Much preferred 'Claiming of Sleeping Beauty' and the two subsequent books in that series. If you are looking for quick reads this book will be good for you.
5,Wonderful twist on children's fairy tales,"Looking around this site I stubbled upon this book and being a lover of fairy tales I thought it couldn't hurt to check this one out..and I'm glad I did it was well worth the money. The fairy tales in this book are some of my most favorites and the twists that the author put on them were wonderful. I was very surprised and couldn't put the book down.The way the author describes everything in the stories is excellent not crude or nasty, but in a way that makes your blush a bit as well as get your imagination going. I had no trouble putting myself in different parts of the stories.I do hope that the author writes more and does as well as she did on this one."
3,Like Romance Junkfood,"Overall this book is average. Some of the stories were better than others--they ran the full gambit from very sexy to totally boring. But in the end, none of them are long enough to tell a complete satisfactory story. I would have preferred fewer, longer, more in depth stories. But the book is very much as advertised. Fairy tales with an erotic twist. Worth checking out."
4,"Imaginative, silly and fun.",She has taken our childhood fairy tales and turned them into erotic stories that are sexy and fun. I read a chapter from time to time to my partner and it keeps her attention.
4,Enchanting Stories,"The book was well written. A couple of the stories were boring. But, most of them were very exciting. It was hard to put the book down at times. I liked it. I would recommend this book to most of my friends."
4,gift giving,"I bought this book as a gift for a friend. It was the right amount of sassy and fantasy, but fun."
5,good,This book was fantastic. Its very interesting and some fairy tales I have never heard of were in it as well. Maybe my husband will become more literate if I share this book with him.
3,ahh.. its alright.,It's alright I guess... Not really dirty if that's what your after. Don't get me wrong its ok I think I just expected not so cutsey.
3,Pretty good,"I love to read erotica, and I know for a fact that different people think different things are erotic. Some people have more of an extreme erotic sense, so books like these barely touch the surface. (I am one of those people) But this book was still worth the read. It's tons of fun and i love the fairytale twist of things. You will never look at childhood stories the same way again. I read atleast one chapter a night, and the stories are funny, and definitley grab your attention. I'm very glad i purchased this book. I just would recommend it to the newbies who are just starting to get into reading erotica. To those already into or have been into it for years now...Zane or Allison Hobbs are the authors you need to look for."
2,Why all the high ratings?,"I saw many good reviews and also love fairytales.But these were not the kind of fairytales i was expecting.A few i liked, but most were very 'soft' or weird and short.Too bad I gave my money for this one."
3,"an okay read, but nothing spectacular","I bought this book because I loved Rice's ""Sleeping Beauty"" series. This book doesn't even come close. The author does an okay job mixing the feel of a fairy tale with the erotic, but I feel like there's just something lacking. The eroticism is pretty tame and forgettable, and the writing makes it feel more like a drug store romance novel than a piece of erotica. If you're into lighter fare you may enjoy this book, but I guess it was just a little too tame for my liking."
2,Could have been way better,"I love fairy tale retellings, the hotter the better, but I didn't feel that these were all that hot, or as entertaining as I was expecting. I don't think I'll be trying the next in the series. I do really like the cover, though."
2,book,the stories are kind of dumb and boring. in the middle of reading them i don't even want to finish them even though they are like 20 pages long.
1,are u kidding?,erotic? no. porn? yes. beastiality and sadastic stories are not erotic they are sick and this is more accurately described as porn so do not waste your money.
1,Garbage!,This book couldnt turn on anybody. The stories are just garbage. I bought it as a gift for my ex wife. I am sure she didnt finish even one story.
1,lasks passion,"I found this book to be more feminist propaganda than a real sex book; it talks too much about how women are like this and that's why men are like that... etc., and less about the sex (the last chapter, ""ugly duckling"", doesn't even have any sex in it)! and what little sex it does have is so lame (and at times, awkward, rushed, and a bit disturbing) that I find paperback romance novels to be far more enticing."
1,"Not what I expected, could have been better...","I bought this based on various reviews that I had read. It was very bland, and not what I expected at all. I thought it would be more along the lines of Sleepy Beauty triology, i.e. fairy tales with a nice, erotic twist. These stories were so boring and some of them were disturbing in general. I'm not sure what this book should be classified, but it's not erotica. Rather than moving a woman forward in her sexuality, it seems to promote demeaning them. I would recommend Lora Leigh, Shayla Black, or the Sleeping Beauty triology rather than this book. It could have been so much better..."
2,Very Bland,I found these to be very bland and kind of boring. There was no anticipation and the sex scenes were as boring as weak tea
2,Not worth the time - could have been so much better,"I agree with the poster who says this is an intriguing idea with poor delivery. Too many stories - not enough character development. Some of it is just plain disturbing and uncomfortable. Not enough romance and love. Just kinda yuck. And, if you are curious about this one, but not sure - stay FAR away from the sequel - Enchanted Again. It's horrifying and disgusting, compared to this one.Both books went to recycle land. I'm embarrassed to even have them in the house."
3,Interesting,"This is my first erotic book and it isn't bad for beginners. All of the stories are different. You're likely to find some that you like and some that you don't. Some go into more detail than others. I found three of the stories to be really interestig. However, I also found a few that focused on the backround more than sex."
5,Spicy fairytales,Pleasant fairytales and others of the kind with a great deal of different spices in the plots. Nice and original. Well written.
5,Not Taboo At All,"I've read Nancy Madore before and have been looking for this book again. I would totally recomment this book for a first timer looking to figure out what they are looking for when it comes to their own sexuality. Most of us women have been told all of our lives that sex and our own sexuality is BAD. We are supposed to be ladies on the outside and yet whores in the bedroom, turns out we can be both and it's not a bad thing at all? Am I right, women?Ms. Madore really brings that out and this is a must read for anyone exploring their own sexuality especially a more mature female.Keep reading and Ms. Madore KEEP WRITING!!!"
3,Eh. There could have been more to it.,For this to be a fairy tale take on erotica it lacked the imagination I was expecting.
2,I guess I don't know the meaning of Erotic,"or I am old, because it was not what I expected and kind of boring. I read lots of reviews and while I have been thinking about getting Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty, I decided to start with Enchanted and I was disappointed but again it could just be me."
2,Same Old,"The first five stories are the same story over and over: girl is taken away from family (who hasn't had that fantasy?)to a sumptuous palace/castle/manse, enchanted male sneaks into her room or she into his. He takes her and in some way or other is transformed into a prince. I really didn't find the fantasies erotic for adults. I am surprised to find that her research concluded that women's fantasies are centered around fairy tales. Just did not do it for me."
1,Stupid tales,Please. This is pure junk. I regret downloading it on to my Kindel. A 12 year old could have written better sex scenes. This must be a horney kid's book of tales.
3,hmm..,"I wasn't too thrilled with most of the endings, but as far as eroticism goes, it was definitely that."
2,libido junk food,"I read this cover to cover non stop, put this book down, and left disappointed. I am intrigued that someone could take these beloved fairy tales and add an adult twist to them. However, to go this far why not go further? There was missed opportunity to take some of these stories to a further more evolved plot. This was nothing more than libido junk food."
1,bad bedtime stories,"Hey me and my girlfriend like to read erotic stories. But this book was all but not erotic. The idea is very good but you often read of girls who have sex with a lot of guys (example: snowwhite and the 7 dwarfs) and yes if you thinking ""no this can't be"" then you are right it is. No there is no prince for snowwhite cause she has 7 dwarfs. It was realy awefull to me. So if you want to read a good book espacealy if you are a couple, then keep your hands of this book."
2,Not if you like plot and character development,"I searched high and low for this book after picking up the authors 12 Dancing Princesses...That will probably go into my used bookstore bag unread. While the stories are well written and have the potential to be fun reads, and I love the idea of erotic fairy tales, they are too short! You don't really get to know the characters, there's no real plot to them and if you blink you miss the story.There are better places and authors for making fairy tales erotic."
3,Social commentary disguised as Erotica,"Let me first say that I was very intrigued by the idea of reading my favorite fairy tales with a naughty twist. This book, however, was a bit of a disappointment. I applaud Ms. Madore for incorporating various fantasies throughout her book (to appeal to different sexual tastes). But I was VERY aggravted that she used this type of literature as a place to air her opinions of society. Several stories are almost weighted down by this. One in particualr, The Goose Girl, doesn't even involve sexuality. It's more about self-esteem, pride, and being successful as a woman. WHO CARES!! I am reading EROTICA to be turned on, and occasionally to run across a really interesting character or plot line. NOT TO HEAR WHAT AN AUTHOR THINKS IS WRONG WITH SOCIETY!! NOT IN EROTICA!! Perhaps she should seek a more suitable platform from which to spew her ridiculous ideas. (my first and last Madore read!)"
3,My First!,"Erotica is a new genre for this literature professor.As a woman, I was looking for something titillating for women, but hetero. I found the early stories to fit the bill; however, as I ventured on into the collection of stories, I realized that the stories weren't so much ""for women"" as they were traditional MALE fantasies (more than one story featuring the woman in question enjoying either serial or simultaneous sex with several men at once, for example).Not that there's anything wrong with that, if that's what you want.But I was expecting something more. . . .woman-centered --not so much man-engulfing.So to speak."
2,Just a fairytale not erotica,"I was really disapointed with this set of stories. I read erotica and felt this was just silly and very ""vanilla"". The only stories of this book that I felt were remotely erotic was Beauty and Beast and Snow White and Bluebird,everything else was just like a short trashy romance fan-fiction. Nora Robert's novels have more erotica then this novel, and I gotta say that's really sad."
2,Not the best,"i got this because it was highlighted for women. There were a couple good ones, but overall didn't resonate with me."
3,Mixed Bag,"There are some stories that you will really love and will get to you, and then there are some that will just bore you.It all depends on your fetishes and what you like. If you are looking for an introduction to everything with a fun twist...then this is great."
3,Kenzie,"I liked the book but I wasn't what I had expected. I proably won't purchase the sequals, but it was a good read all-in-all."
2,"A Die-Hard DP Fan, but Not of This!","I've read most of DP's books; some I've loved & read over & over again; some were so boring that I just had to skip-through.... I'm sorry to say that I had to skip-through the first 2/3 of the first story in this book -- Wedding in White. It was not as sensual or gripping as some of her better works. Only the last 1/3 of the story was gripping, and I would give about 2.5 stars for this story....What was worse was the second story in this book -- Circle of Gold. It just didn't make any kind of sense! There were just so many contradictions in this story that made me believe that DP must have written this one while she was dozing-off, and I can't believe that anyone who has the least bit of analytical mind would give this story more than a 1 star!"
5,Must read for a soon to be law student.,"Forget what you see on television about how the law works. The law is often about the forceful personalities behind the robes and how they are shaped by their own life experiences. This book touches on the incorporation doctrine, judicial restraint and many other broad judicial themes. The outcome is counter intuitive and, thus, eyeopening for civil libertarians and conservatives alike."
5,A hot double CD,"Jungle Sky never fails in putting out HOT underground jungle. With DJ Souslinger on the team you can't lose, and The Return of Shft by 1.8.7. is one of my personal all time favorites. Not a disappointment. Get it!"
5,Wonderful book,"This is a wonderful book. It has appetizers, entrees, and of course desserts from Imar's Delights of the Garden Restaurants. My favorite, because it is simple and tastes great, it the basic Kush. It is basically soaked cracked bulgur wheat with seasoning and veggies, but the flavor is fantastic. The desserts are easy and taste great. For those concerned with fat intake, the recipes do not have a calorie tables and some do use oils. If you are vegan, some of the recipes call for honey, but you can substitute maple syrup to taste. I highly recommend this un-cook book.Included in the front matter is a well written discussion on nutrition and in the back is an essential nutrient appendix.One last note, make sure you have a good food processor for some of the dishes. We busted our cheap Regal belt-driven processor and bought a nice little Cuisinart direct-drive.Enjoy"
3,"Good book, but not does not live up to its name","Though the book claims to be about food that is preparedwithout heat, one of the primary ingredients is ""kush"",which is made out of crackedwheat bulgur - cooked!Other than that, I think it is great. END"
2,Not right,This was the wrong dvd that I wanted but never the less it is still in good condition.Thanks you for the prompt deliver.
5,Thought provoking film on Healing,"This DVD opened for me a gateway into the way Spiritists in Brazil combine Spiritual Healing with convential medicine.It makes a link between Shaminism and the healing work of Spiritist hospitals who treat the whole person by giving loving assistance to those spirit entities who are stuck in the energy field of the patients.The film reports that they estimate that these spirit entities are implicated in 60% ofcases of mental illness,In the presentation we see a healing group at work and have commentary as to what is happening.It is well narrated by Emma Bragdon who takes a very practical,questioning,and down to earth approach to this important subject.It is a short film 33 mins and packs in a lot of very honest and truthful comment from its contributors.I was inspired to explore the subject further as a result of my viewing.A wonderful measured introduction to the whole subject of Spiritism and its contribution to our Health"
3,Interesting,"Very interesting documentary, but I thought it was a bit short. I was expecting more out of it. It's good for general info and as an intro to the topic."
2,Fun Book-Lousy Theology,"This series of books should be read for fun and entertainment, not as a discourse in the theology of eschatology. I enjoyed reading the books myself, but would hesitate to recommend them to a new Christian or nonbeliever who might become confused."
5,"""Left Behind"" Collection Volumes 5-8","I've completed reading volumes 1-4 and about 1/2 way thru volume 5.I'm quite late picking up on this series (I think volume 1 was released in 1994). No matter the time frame...everyone, EVERYONE should read this collection...at least volume 1. (I have not talked to anyone who could resist reading additional volumes.)Whether for the ""spiritual reinforcement"", prophecy, or simply for fictional novel entertainment, these books will make you think, AND keep the pages turning! Jenkins' and LaHaye's writing styles work so well in a series, but individually each volume is thought provoking and entertaining!Thank goodness Amazon still makes these books available!"
3,Left Behind Series,"I found the first five volumns(five stars)to be most interesting and believable in terms of my Biblical understanding. However, the last three volumns were no where near the quality and appeal. The authors began reaching for a story line that just was not well thought out. I found myself finishing the series only to be ""left behind"" wondering how the remaining 2 years of the Tribulation period would play out with these characters. I have ordered volumn nine since I might as well see it through but I have to admit I have become dissapointed. I have ordered the Christ Clone Trilogy since the feedback has been so positive."
5,A Great Novel that Has Changed My Life,"When I heard of this book I couldn't wait to buy it. When I got it I couldn't put it down. The book was awesome and I will purchase the other series. Everyone needs to read this book, it will change their lives also. I also read another great book of this nature: ""Revelations: The Years 2000"" by Janet Markey. Both of these books are fantastic books to read!"
4,Brio High Speed Train w/ sound,"My 4 year old son loved this train. It looks like the real TGV, and rolls pretty well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the sound it makes is very quiet. This can be a good thing sometimes, but my son really like noise!"
1,Not worth it,"I was hoping for something much better than this. This was a complete waste of time. It's a home job for sure. There was only talking for the first 20 minutes of the video, then after than it showed drawings, etc. that can easily be found online. Half the video is drawings on a wind generator--for no reason whatsoever. Very lame indeed."
1,Amazing,Hard to believe that people are ignorant enough to buy into this type of B.S. This is an indictment of our school system of the highest order.
4,Good Product,Excellent Book!A must have for the serious Star Was Fan or Gamer. Well laid out with lots of excellent information.
2,He's a great director but not a very good storyteller.,"Burt Kennedy has directed many famous stars and made many famous Westerns. He may be a great story-teller in person however this does not come through in this book. There are many things he says are funny before relating a particular anecdote, but I can't really remember laughing once during this book. All the stories seemed to fizzle out and the punch-line seemed to leave the anecdote unfinished. You all know the type of thing I mean. Think of the last party you went to that had the guy who couldn't tell a joke to save his life.Mr. Kennedy does give some insight into the business of movie-making, and this is interesting, but not enough so to save this effort. I have to wonder after reading some of the other reviews if we all read the same book...."
2,Expected more,"Burt Kennedy has written excellent screenplays for Budd Boetticher, but it does not show here. Perhaps he wrote this small book during two or three evenings. He did not care to check facts. There is no plot, just some stories in no particular order. Some are fairly interesting, but the whole is not good. I expected more stories about Scott and Boetticher. If you want a good book about film-making, buy Harry Carey's book. There is a good filmography, but one can get it from IMBD, too. It is again interesting to observe, how differently one can experience a book or a film. Some liked this book very much, some didn't. These kind of ratings are not very helpful. But I did read it, though, but expected much more. I liked his honest evaluations of some some poor films. For me one of those poor ones is the Train Robbers."
2,The Wild Blue Yonder,"Weird, will definitely be a cult favorite. Found the underwater photography/video a little disappointing."
4,Whoa!,"This movie stopped me in my tracks. Simple photography, simple story, simple presentation. It figures into a thought provoking presentation that forces people to say 'why not?'. Perhaps it is sad that we need such stimulus to make us think. But we are lucky to have the opportunity to have our curiousity piqued enough to investigate Werner Herzog's other films."
5,Great image quality and solidly built,If you wanted to try out some true macro photography this is good lens to start with. It provides a decent working distance to the subjects and also doubles as a very nice portrait lens. It's quite sharp even wide open and it renders colors and blur very well.
1,Typing Tutor Crashes,"Several years ago I bought Typing Tutor 7 for my daughter. She used it on our Mac and learned how to type, but she had to endure the numerous crashes it caused. Later we bought a PC, and foolishly ordered Typing Tutor 10 thinking that surely a program as faulty as the previous Typing Tutor couldn't stay on the market. We were wrong. We installed the program and my son signed in and tried to get started. The comuter crashed twice in the first 15 minutes and we uninstalled the program and vowed never to buy another Typing Tutor program again!"
2,Used book,I ordered a new book. The book I recieved had underlining in it and some of the lessons had been filled in. It is hard to do the lessons when you are looking at someone else's answers.
1,"Sorry, I didn't like it","I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's not that good. Things you don't care about, like who started what and how things were done in the old days, are carefully explained. This is great information if you want to hang out over a couple of brewskies and B.S. with the guys. But the actual step-by-step techniques leave out so many steps they are unusable. In other words, it's a great book if you know so much you don't need it. If you do need it, you've just wasted your money on this one. My hunch is that they got their considerably huge group of scruffy, over 50 geek buddies with pony tails and bald spots to write these reviews for them. You'll be pulling your hair out trying to ""grok"" this one. Besides, they tell you this is the only place to get these ""secrets"". Not in 2001 it aint."
2,What about LAYERS?,"As the book title suggests, channels are the main event here. The problem is that with the introduction of layers in Photoshop, many of the techniques discussed in the book are now much more easily done in layers, making the book out-of-date. The authors suggest that channels are still a valid way to do the work, but why make your work harder than it needs to be?"
5,Best Resource book ever! Buy it for the Holiday's Now!,"A must have for everyone's computer library. Blows the roof off my head. I had waded my way through the other ""Guides"" without results. This book goes strait to the point, direct, simple easy to understand, good condensed facts without the fluff. These guys have a great sense of humour!"
3,Nice,Good value for this item...would purchase again if needed at a later date..would recommend to others to purchase also..thanks for product!
5,Fabulous Scent !,"I wanted to purchase the perfume but found I didn't have that much money to spare so I went for the perfumed lotion. I have to say that this lotion is a man - magnate! Every time I wear it, I get men running after me and telling me I smell so nice. It's so crazy that even my dad and my uncle both in different cities wondered what perfume I was wearing and started to sniff my wrist. The greatest thing is you only need a tiny dab behind your ears, neck and wrists and it lasts and lasts. I will purchase a few more soon."
2,Big mistake,"I bought this version by mistake. This version has it's moments, but is no comparison to the James Stewart version. Harry Anderson as Dowd had potential at first, but the movie is ruined for the most part by certain actors trying too hard to act, and some too little."
3,Real Bass - RMS Not Real,I have had this sub now for about a year. And when I say it is a very nice sounding sub. I am not sure I have ever heard one hit so deep. But the RMS is flat wrong. I blew it using a 120W Bazooka AMP.
2,Not Patchen at his best.,"Unfortunately, this is not the best recording of Patchen with jazz accompaniment. The Canadian jazz group that accompanies Patchen on these recordings play jazz standards that don't necessarily fit with the poetry. Plus, Patchen sounds lost, and his readings are surprisingly poor (even a little bizarre, the way he stretches out the vowels).The jazz/poetry album that Patchen recorded with Allyn Ferguson and the Chamber Jazz Sextet (now available on CD as ""Rebel Poets of America"") is vastly superior to this one. Patchen's readings on ""Rebel Poets"" are top-notch, and the jazz accompaniment (which consists of Ferguson's original compositions that he tailored for each individual poem) is also excellent.If you can find ""Rebel Poets of America,"" I'd say that's the one to own. ""Kenneth Patchen Reads with Jazz in Canada"" is for completists only.`"
3,Useful but annoying,"This is a pretty good wormlight. It does a very good job of lighting up the screen in even the darkest room, and allowed me to see...or it would have, but the light is actually OVER the screen, blocking your vision of whatever you're playing. Another thing that is convinient yet annoying is that you plug the wormlight right into the side of the Game Boy. This is good because you don't need any batteries. This is bad because it drains energy from the Game Boy. I also read in an earlier review that you can't link up in a dark room with this item which is a very good point. It is better than the magnifier light I also reviewed, but not by much."
4,MY review!!!,This ables you to play gameboys in the dark! Or like when you go outside after 5:00 it's dark! So this is great for gameboys and it is at a great price!!
4,Surprisingly good,This is a very thin little paperback publication at only 96 pages long. At first glance I rather expected it to be a cheaply thrown together mish-mash of the usual Chow meins and sweet and sour dishes but the content is actually very good. There is a good range of dishes from across China and several are accompanied by diagrams or pictures illustrating some of the preparation techniques involved. There is not much in here that I don't have in many other books but I would have no hesitation in recommending this to novice cooks. Illustrations for all dishes would have been nice but those that have been provided are very good. A nice little book overall.
1,Bizaar recipe's,Had the most odd stomach turning recipe's. I tossed it... didn't even think I could sell it in a yard sale. Had spices and ingredients I don't even have a clue of where to purchase ... on top of just weird recipes. This was just not a good purchase.
1,Buyer Beware,"This set started shutting itself off intermittently a week after I bought it. When the repairman came, however, it worked perfectly. Then 5 months later it started shutting itself off as soon as it was powered on, and this time the repair is costing $225- for a set that's less than 6 months old!"
3,"Angels, Women, and Typos....","I was fortunate enough to read the full story behind this by contacting the editor, Jim Rizoli. After having finally had the time to sit down and digest this rich piece of fiction, I am most curious to see if I can get my hands on the original novel, because this book seemed to have a number of strikingly modern conceptions of what life before the Deluge might have been like.Told from a first-person point of view in journal format, this beautifully descriptive book gives us a glimpse--and just a glimpse--of a gorgeous world, and the deceptive allure of sin. My only complaint is that which I have repeated for many self-published books, and that is that the editor/author could have used the services of a grammarian. The number of typos and grammatical errors were sufficient to distract me from the story, but only temporarily.Overall, one of the most effective pieces of antediluvian fiction, in terms of being able to describe an alien and credible culture."
4,Fun - and now we have both versions,"This recording stems back from the late 1970s and shows its age a bit but is still fun to listen to. A warning - it may not play properly on your CD player, it played on my iTunes and one CD/DVD player but not the other. Enough said about that. They have remastered the recording as best they can but the balance between voices is a little (and sometimes very) uneven. The performances are spirited and the performers really get into the spirit of this farce. It says it's the 1858 version but you have to go to the other EMI set (Minkowski with Natalie Dessay) to get that. This is actually the 1874 version with a later-written overture tacked onto it. But this does not distract one from the fun of this piece. My advice, buy both versions and sum it up for yourself. Both have their assets and drawbacks. Enjoy listening."
2,Ondekoza Played them better!,"This CD is a re-recording of pieces done better in 1995 or 1980's by Ondekoza. Can't see why anyone would by this CD instead of those. Also, they are genuine Japanese taiko."
1,Audio Quality,"Unfortunately this CD has poor sound quality. Better luck next time. I usually like taiko cds, but this one was not so hot."
5,Essential for Fan Restoration!!!,"This amazing 3-in-oil in the blue bottle labeled for ""MOTOR OIL"" is essential for all activities when rebuilding AC or DC motors especially for fan restoration projects. Don't purchase the ""RED 3-in-1"" as it contains Naptha. The Naptha gets the dirt in suspension then evaporates leaving dirt on the bearing surface, like detergents. Not good idea for motors! Great, inexpensive lubricant for all 20wt. motor applications."
4,"An underappreciated ""Salsa Dura"" gem.","If anything, this relatively-unheralded CSD proves that Papo Lucca and Sonora Poncena could still turn out great albums filled with the strong and spicy ""Salsa Dura"" that has always been their specialty--even at a time when most of their peers from an earlier era had stopped (temporarily) recording. With the sole exception of ""Date Prisa"" virtually every track on this obscure CD is just as good as their 1970s works."
2,Disturbed Man on the Loose,"This ""memoir"" by Mr. Eisenberg is a disgusting display of self indulgence passing for some form of wisdom. His depraved life and behaviors,from the openning chapter where as a buddhist monk he rapes a woman, to the closing sentences indicating no self awareness at all, is an example of the worst of the '60s gone even worse. How Eisenberg is allowed to walk the planet unescorted is a testament to the depravity of amerika. And outing his own daughter? The man is fit for a desserted island somewhere."
3,Nice photography but it's simply not that useful,"My plan for this book was to use it as a reference tool while watching races. Unfortunately, the book fails in this regard. It does not have an index or glossary to look up drivers/constructors/races. The photos (there are many and they are nicely done) and results are listed chronologically but this is cumbersome when trying to look for something when you don't have all of the information (e.g., year/race/driver). This book succeeds as coffee table filler but not much else."
3,Apple corer,"Have only used once, so maybe I need to get more practice, but the apple core was removed before the peeler started, so I ended up peeling the apple by hand, because the remaining apple just kept turning around on the spindle."
5,My encounter with Farpoint...,"This is a very worth debut for the up and coming progressive rock band, Farpoint. The album is well written and performed. Lead singer Dana Oxendine shines on this first release. Her vocals are strong and sultry. Guitar, bass, and drums are very tight. What really impressed me was the obvious effort put into the production and engineering of this cd. High quality prog that echoes Pink Floyd, Genesis, and Yes. Worthy of the collection!Bands like this are hard to come by. I can tell they really love to make music. Good music..."
4,"Not Bad, Not bad at all","Well, I for one think this band has come a long way from their days of playing in a garage of one of the members.....Well o.k. maybe a couple of hundred feet isn't that far but it IS a start and so is this, their first album. I DO think it could use some work (especially in the male vocal department) but it is a very solid effort muscially speaking.And I am NOT saying this because I know members of this band. I am saying this cause one of them has kidnapped one of my dogs and won't let him come home until I write them a favorable review....Seriously though, not bad, you shouldn't take my word for it either, its worth a listen.I thank you, my dog thanks you, the band's mothers thank you...."
2,The Good Old Days....,So I bought this because it was less than $5; well even at that price and with a free $5 promo from Amazon MP3 I still feel I got ripped off. The audio quality on this is horrible. It sounds like they played them on a record player and put a recording mike up to the phonograph player. Hisses and all tinny. :(
4,Laser Decorating Kit,"The Zircon 61385 Laser Decorating Kit is a must have item, especially if you want your wife or girlfriend to perform all the decorating needs in your household. My wife loves it and so do I, for it allows me more time to watch football or basketball games."
2,Would be great -- if it worked,"It looks like it should be a great product. The laser ball thing is kinda cool (though I dont have much need for it.) What I really need is a stud finder. This product is nice, compact, and cheap. Unfortunately, it only finds the studs about 30% of the time. So, if you want a stud finder that finds some studs some of the time, this is for you! If you want a stud finder that reliably finds studs, keep looking.As you may guess, I am returning the product."
2,OOPS! Custom Picnic Furniture doesn't stay locked,"I love that: A) You custom cut the boards so I could make several of different sizes to fit exactly where and whom I wanted. B) They covert quickly and easily from benches with backs to picnic tables with benches. C) Since it has a lifetime warranty and I used composite 2x4's (which have a lifetime warranty), these are the last benches/picnic tables I will have to build. (No rotting, no insect damage).Suggestions: Measure very carefully. Pre-drill holes. Use a screw gun. Use spacers (not provided), don't eyeball it. They go together quickly, but don't rush. Adjust overhang to proportionate degree.TABLE TOP IS WOBBLY, DOESN""T LOCK WELL. MANY SPILLS AND MUCH CLEAN UP!!!"
2,unsteady top,"I bought two of these to use as a complete table. The instructions were easy to follow and it wasn't very difficult to assemble. As a bench, the product is sturdy and comfortable. As a table, or half a table, the product is unsatisfactory. There is no way to lock the table top in the upright postition so that it does not wobble. The plastic parts seem to flex and even a wodden wedge does not allow the top to be made solid and stable."
1,bad engineering,They drilled the holes in the wrong place. The locking mechanism wouldn't. work. It took a long time to reengineer it.
5,Great set up for my deck,"The first one took me about 45 minutes to put together as I tried to get all the spacing correct, etc. The second one only about 20 minutes. (I'm a prefectionist...so could be quicker for others.)They look great and work great!I have a smaller deck so made them the 6 foot length and I have a seating area most of the time and can make the extra table in just a minute!Very sturdy and sit 6 adults comfortably!"
3,Functional but not pretty,"I used TREX instead of wood to make my bench. Worked well by drilling a few holes where there weren't any and that was no big deal. I did try the Krylon plastic paint on the subassembly to give it a more pleasing color and while it did cover, the adhesion was not very durable."
5,THE Retriever,Bought 3 previously and wanted to replace 2 of them! A great invention! Arrived in a timely fashion as usual.
4,bench,"Item is everything advertised. Except they only carry 1 color even though they ask you for your choice. Kind of hard for 1 person to put it together, but once assembled it's great. Would suggest using pressure treated lumber on it."
5,Excellent Tables or Benches,These benches are downright awesome. They are well designed and very sturdy thanks to the 2x4s that you must purchase separately. I bought 4 sets of these to make 2 picnic tables out of. Depending upon where you intend to store these you may wish to stain or water seal the 2x4s so that the benches will last alot longer. When assembling you will want at least one other person there to assist you. You CAN do it by yourself but its a bit difficult.
5,Flip Top BenchTable,"I recently purchased two tan colored Flip Top Bench Tables. I am very pleased with them. The only space I had available to paint & assemble was outdoors. We've been getting a lot of rain, so the painting & assembly was delayed. Everything is now complete & I can say that I found this project easy to assemble, except for the seat portion, that was a little ackward, I needed a second pair of hands for the 2nd bench. I haven't taken any pictures yet, But I painted my 2 x 4s with chocolate brown paint, which looks real nice against the tan frame.It looks to me to be a very sturdy bench/table and I would definitely purchase other products from this company."
3,"great concept, shaky quality control","This is a clever, useful (if not particularly attractive) design. I have 2x4basics benches that I love. However, the flip top bench table that I received was broken. I returned it, and Amazon was great about sending a replacement out immediately. Unfortunately, the replacement was broken in the very same place. After lugging the second return to the post office, I was too tired to give it a third shot. That being said, if you get one that's NOT broken, you'll probably like it!"
4,great farm product,"most things on our farm perform more than one function.the bench/table fits right in.extra outdoor seating for family gatherings.and a shooting bench for our back yard gun range.sitting as a picnic table of a place to set your skeet and shells.Only bad thing, i made mine at the max 8'think i will redo it at 6 or 4'just to much bow in it at 8'"
4,Table/Bench Option,"We purchased two sets of the ends that make into a bench with converting it to a table an option. Many years ago we purchased a similar item but can no longer find the company that made them. Having to settle for a different color scheme was not so difficult as the sand seems to wear the dirt and dust a little easier than our white ones. These don't seem quite as sturdy as the originals we have, but they function very well. The nice thing is we use them as benches most of the time, but when we need eating space the tables are there! They are very easy to put together and since you supply the insert material, you can use what you want. The only suggestion is to paint your inserts before you put it together as it is much easier than after."
2,Needs better editing!,"The content is detailed, informative and sometimes repetitive, but please work on the presentation! One would think that by the 7th edition, most of the mistakes in this textbook would have been corrected. I've seen numerous spelling errors and typos, as well as missing figures. This gives it a really unprofessional look, despite all the diagrams and the ""easy to read style"". The editors should take a course in spelling and typing. If they do not have the time to do so, they should consider spending a few minutes to find out how the spellcheck option works. Proper spelling and grammar are very important, especially for an educational material such as a textbook. Hopefully the eighth edition will turn out to be a bit better."
3,Used by Most of the Larger Vocational Schools,"This book is generally covered in depth by most of the larger vocational schools.I am the owner/Director of a small hands-on type of school We don't have the luxury of time since our course is only 3 months. BUT what we did like was the CD that came with this text. There are still many spelling errors and typing errors, along with missing info. It is a classic-style textbook. I would not recommend it for self-studyN.KehrDirector, National School of Dental Assisting,Stockton[...]"
5,Two romantic tales and one realistic tale,"The big mistake that is made about Flaubert is to classify him as a realist, when in fact he was a romantic. It is universally declared that the whole worth of this volume resides in 'A Simple Heart', the only realistic tale. My heretical take on this is that it is the romantic tales 'St Julian' and 'Herodias' which give this volume its worth. Far from being the best tale, I consider 'A Simple Heart' to be the least interesting tale, a boring tale that has been admired only because of its realism, as if realism were the be-all and end-all of literature."
3,C. Pollard,Craig Pollard is undoubtly the best spy that ever lived. This book is a wonderful documentation of this very true story. The best part of the book is about the Russian archrival spy Leslee.
2,Only in England,"I should have known better. Anything called a ""late summer flower"" by an English author will be long gone in the Midwest. Ok if you live in Maine or seattle, I expect."
1,Don't waste your time...,"I am a big fan of 2KSports, they have the BEST basketball game and until Madden took over, they had a very competitive, and some would say the best, football game. But their baseball franchise is sinking fast. I will go as far as to say that this game is worse than last year. How can any game ratingJD Drew a 100 be worth your time? This game was rushed to the stores and is full of bugs. I pre-ordered it only to re-sell it after playing it once. The Show, 07 is hands down the best baseball game available. So pay the extra 10$ and get a game worth playing, this title will only frustrate you."
3,"Pretty good, but needs work","MLB 2K7 is a great baseball game if you haven't bought one in a while. However, if you can stand it, I encourage you to wait until next year. The game itself looks great, it's just all the little things that give this a rating a 3 stars. For example, the commentary will be ill timed and say ""and he boots it!"" when there was no error on the play. Also, the rosters are only current as of early February as numerous higher profile players David Wells, Jeff Weaver, and Cliff Floyd are still free agents. It also seems to me that the computer plays exceedingly well. My difficulty is only on pro but the computer makes all kind of diving, jumping, and amazing plays in the field to deny me hits. Overall, this game is great, it makes the video game seem more like you were watching a major league game, but all the little things just take away from its greatness and drops it to a 3 star game."
1,Crap-Tastic,"This Game is oh-me-gawd awful. I wouldn't expect crappy graphics out of a 2K series game. 2K is known for putting close to next gen graphics on ESPN NFL 2K5 (which assassinates Madden by a long shot)Outdated Rosters, Sometimes the A.I doesnt allow you to win(and this is on pro!!!) At least it wasnt an offensive minded game like 2K6 for 360. You can actually play D in this game. I could easily score 10-15 runs on all-star in 2K6. That is why I gave a 3 for fun. The A.I. is very competitive, other than that please get MLB: The Show 07. I know it looks like a remake of last year's game, but it is worth the 10 extra dollars."
3,Not Quite what I expected,"I own it for the PS2.Good Game. Overall grapchics are not an improvement from other games, gameplay is somewhat ""more realistic"", that's a plus. Too bad ESPN is not endorsing this game, you really felt like it was a TV broadcast when you played it before, now it sounds like an average baseball game. Too bad for 2K."
2,Baserunning Sucks,"the baserunning on the game sucks. It has many, many bugs and the players dont even come close to how they look. Early 2000 games looked a lot better than this one."
1,Pretty Awful,"This game is terrible. I was shocked to find my Minnesota Twins who won 96 games last year were ranked 24th overall, and the Yankees (with no more than a mediocre pitching staff coming into the season) had a perfect overall rating. The confusing game play did nothing to overcome the ranking flaws. I'll give The Show a try."
2,Ho Hum,I guess I am going to have to upgrade soon to PS 3 or xbox 360. This game is simply not up to par on PS 2.
1,Horrible,"I just went and purchased ""The MLB 2007 the show"" this afternoon. 2K7 froze constantly to the point I had to restart every time I played. Pretty hard to get through a season at that pace. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
3,"Nothing ""baby"" about it!","OK ladies, this watch is HUGE! The measurements listed by Amazon are accurate, but not being terribly familiar with the metric system, they didn't jump out at me as being that large. The watch face is a little over a half inch thick, which feels very big and clunky. I have slightly smaller than average wrists, but I am by no means tiny and I thought for sure they must have sent me the men's version by mistake. I made my 6'2"" husband try it on and it looked like the perfect size for him.Other than the size, the watch looks very well made and is quite attractive. I can't comment on the durability, as it will be going back tomorrow....Bottom line; if you're looking for a very large watch, this is perfect!"
2,dead beat watch,I received the watch quickly and in good shape. It is big for a woman but it's ok. Like the other reviewer said the battery was dead. I had to replace it for $10 or mail it back to the company for about the same. It is also impossible to open. The Jeweler I used is an authorized Invicta dealer. It took him 10 minutes to unlock the band. He said the brand has varying levels of quality. This explaind why some are $130 and some are $1300. If I had to do it over again I honestly wouldn't.
2,Another dead EXPENSIVE battery,"After getting a non-working watch and wanting to write a review, I discovered other reviews indicating this is a common problem. So I went to my local store to get another battery, which usually costs around $5, only to find out the battery for this watch is different and costs $20! You'll be spending more for the watch than you planned. Also, the band is so huge that I could slip it on and off without unlatching it. I had to have 4 links removed to fit my average size wrist. While this is an attractive watch, I'm not confident in Invicta since this is the second defective Invicta watch I received, the other was a chronograph and the stop watch function didn't work so I ordered this one, a second dud."
2,Constructing Questions for Interviews and Questionnaires,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is very clearly written, and gives examples all the way through about the ways in which design of questions will influence the responses to them. Foddy gives a multitude of tips, backed up by research about questionnaire design, about how to standardise questions and get responses to the questions you intended to ask.Highly recommended"
4,nyko wormlight berry,The Nyko Wormlight is just fabulous. It turns the GBC into a flawless handheld. The power it takes is minimal.
5,Peanuts Treasury is NOT the same as Peanuts Treasury,"Apparently there has been a mix-up: The two ""editions"" of this book DON'T correspond to each other. I've bought the paperback one, and it does not contain some of the strips mentioned in the review section."
4,Better than most of the other '60s Peanuts collections,"Until a few years ago, Peanuts Classics collections were very hard to find except in your local library. But Peanuts Treasury is much better than most of those-better than most of the `60s collections, anyway. Not to say that the Classics books aren't good, but several of the books repeat strips, print the pages backwards, or even repeat stories (or parts of stories). But this collection doesn't do that. Not only that, but this book has about three times as many more pages AND there are more strips per page (five instead of two). A few of the stories aren't finished in this book either, but nevertheless it's a great collection."
4,Great Collection,"This is a great overall collection of the comic strip from 1959 through the early 1960's, though I do agree that some of the story lines seem out of chronological order. I do wish there had been more information on Mr. Schulz and where some of his ideas for the story lines came from, but, for the price, it's a great value. I would highly recommend this book to someone who wants a basic collector's book of just the comic strips with no comments from Mr. Schulz. It is strictly a collection of comic strips... nothing more. But it is a collection of some of his best."
5,Used book that looks like new,"The book was supposed to be used, but it is in perfect conditions. No marks, scratch, tears.Great purchase, and great vendor.Book then is fantastic."
2,Expressive and Receptive Fingerspelling for Hearing Adults,"I was told by a native ASL speaker that this was not a good book but having said that, I found this book a guide for practicing. It has you fingerspelling whole sentences and I didn't like that but the parts where it has you practice lists of words with like letters was helpful. It didn't help in either expressing or receiving but it did help in just practicing the letters"
5,i LOVE it!,"hey,first i bought this cd 'cause i only knew the song ""another perfect day"" and i loved it when i first heard it, but then when you start listening to it you can't stop playing this cd over and over again, I just love it, I mean i just start singing the songs all the time, I even listen to it in my moms car, is like adicting, lol. anyways, buy it, this is the coolest cd ever ;) bye!C YA!!!"
2,Good for exfoliation but doesn't last,"The Sisal glove is reasonably priced for short term use. It conforms nicely to your hand and performs well to exfoliate places a normal back brush doesn't do well, such as arms, legs, etc.The problem is that if you leave it in your shower or bath caddy and it stays damp it turns colors in about a week. Also the glove had an earthy ""hay"" smell to it even after several uses. Natural/organic products are prone to natural processes. Oh well."
3,A tool with potential but little pay off.,"It is excellent software for creating characters, but good for little else. The information in the accessory books is all but unusable do to the lack of hyperlinks and the map creating software is very limiting due to the lack of tools and icons available. Part of the problem being, their example maps were created by another piece of software (that they want you to buy) misleading your expectations for this software. It seems if you are willing to shell out more cash for the expansion kit that they fix some of these problems."
3,"It is ok, but...","I had high hopes for a book from these two authors, who are usually informative. Unfortunately, their book is simply another list of plants, as available in many other sources. There's nothing really wrong with the text, but another book with more plants, more pictures, and more info on techniques would probably serve better. The Southern Living Garden Book is much better for experienced gardeners. For new gardeners, the brief books by Rodale or Ortho are better."
3,An incomplete plant list,"The best part of the book is the introduction. Otherwise, some of the plants I see most often around Georgia are not listed - daylilies aren't in there! Other than that, it is well organized, but I wouldn't consider it a good list of what to plant in Georgia."
2,Film Flood,"A very disappointing interpretation of Richard Doyle's excellent book of the same title. They could have done so much more. I appreciate that making disaster films is difficult but huge chunks of the story are missing, chunks which would have given a much better forward to the story. This is one that I would not bother to watch again.Pam Conrads"
2,Most definitely NOT Bobby's best.,"This album was originally released in 1971 and is much more of a boogaloo rather than salsa. I was quite disappointed with this album as it generally lacks the searing-hot salsa dance jams that made his subsequent albums so good. To hear and enjoy Bobby Valentin and his orchestra at their 1970s best buy the ""Rompecabezas"", ""Soy Boricua"" and ""Rey Del Bajo"" CDs from 1972, 1973 and 1974 respectively (all of which feature Frankie Hernandez and the unstoppable Marvin Santiago on lead vocals)."
3,Arrebatarnos.,"I am very split on this album. Made up mostly of boogaloo songs, that were very popular at the time, this album does not exemplify Valentin's music, sound or career to the fullest. Most of the songs are also sung in English, and like I said, are not the hard hitting salsa tune he usual put out, instead boogaloos. Do not fear though, as this was his last album of this type as he would release ""Se la Comio"" just after this one and truly begin to build his legacy as one of the best salsa has ever had. ""Ki Ki Ri Ki"", ""Yambu"" and ""Descarga Mozambique"" are quite good though and would be worthy to be on any of his other albums. Plus they managed to save this album from becoming a total disaster and falling into 1 or 2 star rating. I give it a 2.5 stars."
4,A great song,"My opinion is aonly about the song Margarita, though is not mentioned as one of his best songs I must encourage you to listen to it."
2,Great potential never fulfilled,"When you watch a ghost story, you expect some spooks, chills and a few explanations about the backstory.What you get in Room 205 is a sometimes badly dubbed film that lacks any scare effect.Katrine is a troubled young woman who moves away from home after her mother's death. There, she discovers spiteful housemates who want to make her life hell after a bad hook up. During a rave, a ghost suddenly awakens and sets out to destroy them all.As I watched this film, I kept waiting for that AH-HA moment - the one that pulls everything together in an intriguing twist. I also expected a few scares. I got non of that. The plot was seriously underdeveloped. There were obvious directions it could have gone, but everything was just, well, very dull.Perhaps this works for European audiences, but it is not for the American horror fan. Save your cash for other Ghost House titles."
2,Not very meat-y.,"This book could easily have been half the number of pages for several reasons. Besides using larger print (which is okay by me) and lots of b&w drawings, she only uses about 2/3 of the page for text, so there's quite a bit of blank space. Mainly though, I got tired of her repeating the same information. For example, when she talks about cabinets, she tells you the same stuff in the chapters on kitchens and home offices. She repeats the information about lighting in the bathroom and living room chapters. Also, she likes to decorate with white and often recommends that color scheme, which doesn't seem very practical to me. Overall, I learned a couple of things about decorating and picked up a few tips, but unless you really don't know anything at all about decorating, I would keep looking for a book with more depth and detail."
5,Creative Childbirth,"I felt safe,healthy,confident and my birth was easy and a joy. Book easy to read ,a simple very doable important method.the only way to go .I read them all .this book is a gift to the world for all time."
1,What a [bad book],"This book is a poorly written [copy] of the true HypnoBirhting(R) method founded by Marie Mongan. I had my second child using Marie Mongan's HypnoBirthing(R) method, and later found this book. I was truly disappointed to have wasted my money looking for some kind of extra enlightenment. Save your money and read HypnoBirthing(R), a Celebration of Life and take the HypnoBirthing classes. It's much more simple, with much less fluff."
1,Don't waste your time/money,"This book is more like a pamphlet (100 pages) and mainly consists of the notion that women harbor guilt and fear regarding birth (and life in general). She writes, ""Some of the pain and fear of childbirth may stem from the severance woman has experienced (on an unconscience level) from God/self due to the internalization of the myth of original sin."" Wow, she both debunks and glorifies Christianity all in one sentence. Her ""technique"" consists of about 10 pages in the back of the book devoted to progressive relaxation. I gave birth without drugs or intervention by studying the Bradley method (and by believing in myself). I highly recommend Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way and Birthing from Within. Both books give better, more detailed methods of progressive relaxation and are great books for your partner."
4,Good music... from old guys...,"Do you like the old and good rock'n'roll... without verbosity and without extremes? An old and good rock'n'roll played with guitars, bass and drums and a great vocal? So... 7th Key will give you all that stuff!! Simply enjoy yourself!!!"
1,WARNING,"According to several statements last year by John Rzeznik (look up youtube, search terms Iris and Ronan Keating), the COMPOSER of Iris, Mr. Rzeznik did NOT give prior permission for Mr. Keating to use Iris. If true, this would be a flagrant violation of known copyright law. This review is not intended to harm Mr. Keating in any way, but solely to provide information, which this reviewer invites the public to research and determine the truth for themselves."
4,Love the voice!,"As a fan of Ronan's since the time he was with Boyzone, I always look forward to each new cd with anticipation. Each time, he has not disappointed. This new collection of songs is great. I, especially, love ""Bring you Home"" and ""Superman"".I just wish that the music of artists like Ronan Keating and Westlife were more available in the U.S."
4,Mellow,BoyZone introduced Ronan to me and this CD is haunting. Love his voice and looks. And dedicated to his Mum - what a tribute!
3,Black Showed They Could Act,"This movie may not had Hollywood quality, nor the sound or picture. But its worth watching. If you want to see what Black Life was like, the music, the personality and style. Good speaking also in this movie, no Ebonics, no Uncle Tom talking. Its an enjoyable movie. The first time I watched it, I thought it was boring, except for Eunice Wilson song and dance, but the next time I watched it, I enjoyed it. Prety Dorothy Van Engle has the leading female role, she's a convincing actress and worth a watch. Not one of Oscar Micheaux best, but worth a look."
3,A decent movie....,A lawyer given a pro-bono case that turns into a harder case than expected. The defendant is not what he seemed to be when the case was taken. The movie has a nice plot twist at the end.Cher did a pretty good job of pulling this movie together. It is not a family movie because of the language and intense scenes.
2,It's not widescreen,I ordered this dvd from Amazon and discovered to my dismay that it is full screen rather than widescreen as the amazon description says. It's a good film but would be better in widescreen.
1,A waste of time,"Cher is good in some acting roles, but Cher as a defense attorney - ridiculous. The story and the acting also aren't much, I'd say. Great that some like this film - even Roger Ebert, surprisingly, although he felt cheated by the ending. (His review is interesting.) It all seemed like badly acted nonsense to me. Sorry."
1,Great movie bad dvd,Suspect is a great movie but they ruined this dvd by releasing it in Full Screen only. I disapprove of releasing widescreen filmed movies in non widescreen
4,Cher Bono-Public Defender.Human Rights activist..Superstar!!,"An original tale of corruption within the justice system. Cher defendsa vagrant, played by Liam Neeson, accused of murdering a legal secretary who worked for a supreme court justice, who had committed suicide. Randy Quaid plays a reluctant juror with dubious moral ethics, whose interest in the case takes 2nd place to his interest in the public defender. I liked the chemistry between these two. It was almost palpable. I also liked the cold, forbiding photography, depicting the Capital as a harsh, forbidding and uncaring place. Not the greatest mystery thriller, but certainly watchable,especially with Cher in a starring role, and not a sparkle of glitter or naked skin."
1,"Poor sound, with only a few tracks you havent heard 1000 times.","Compilation with very poor sound quality on songs that have been released many times before, sounding much better. There are two or three tracks that are deep cuts from B.B., and a couple others, that are a little kewl, but overall, not worth the time. There are also mislabled tracks."
1,"Disappointing addition to this series of ""That's Not My..."" books.","If you're looking for a touchy-feely book, keep looking. This one's a real disappointment to the series of ""That's not my..."" books. Quite simply, it's just boring. As an alternative, I'd recomend ""That's Not My Bear"" or ""That's Not My Pony."""
2,dashmat cover,Item looks cheap as the edges aren't stitched and the unit does not fall into the dash depressions as expected. It just sits there and looks wrinkly.
5,A Must Read,This is a true insider's account of the investigation and arrest of John Walker. This and Pete Earley's Family of Spies are the two best books on the Walker spy ring.
2,This CD should not have been recorded or released!!!!,"The late Pete ""Conde"" Rodriguez was undeniably one of the greatest soneros of all time. Papo Lucca is a great pianist/bandleader who has been leading Sonora Poncena (one of Puerto Rico's best salsa bands) for over thirty years now. Unfortunately, this CD is the most lacklustre and uninspired album in their careers. Why? It is an exact replica of Luis Miguel's 1991 bestseller ""Romance"" (with the songs appearing in the exact same sequence as on Luis Miguel's CD!). Real instruments were apparently replaced by electronic keyboards and synthesizers (for the most part) and the production has a very sterile and mechanical feel to it. The only good thing about this CD is that Pete gives some truly fervent and impassioned vocal performances on ""Inolvidable"", ""La Puerta"", ""Como"", ""Mucho Corazon"" and ""Cuando Vuelva A Tu Lado""."
4,Finding the edge regarding Civil War Knives.,"It was quite a wait to obtain a copy of Marc Newman's book regarding Civil War Knives & it was worth the wait to find one at a resonable price.Marc's book gives us a look at a lot of knives rarely mentioned in print. Although I believe that a couple of his knives are misidentified as Civil War era (specifically the knives featured on page 32). For the most part, this book gives the reader a chance to see knives carried by both the front line soldier and the officer.These are using knives,,,not the presentation for pomp knives often featured in similar guides. If I were Marc, I would not worry about the misidentified knives. Even Harold Peterson has knives in his "" American Knives "" that were later identified as contemporary recreations.All & all, Marc has done an outstanding job compiling this selection of historic Americana."
4,Got me through Fluids and Hydraulics,This book helped me get through my Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics classes. Really helps to clarify topics discussed in other text books. I still use this a a reference when i need to look up or clarify something.
2,Boring,"This is an old novel, not particularly well written and tends to be pretentious in the style used in the late 19th century. I do not recommend it and would not buy another one of hers."
1,bad edition for teaching,"This edition of the novel, unlike the older Oxford edition, includes absolutely no information about the novel. From what printing is this edition taken, for example? No introduction, no footnotes or glosses--nothing at all to help students read this novel.But what is far more annoying are the deliberate OMISSIONS OF TEXT! A total of five chapters are missing, described as ""tedious"" and summarized briefly. Also, though Ann Radcliffe selected epigraphs for each chapter before the novel's 1791 publication, none of these are included, despite being rather interesting and insightful.All in all, this edition is ridiculously bad as a scholarly text and not much better as entertainment, since the missing chapters really DO contribute to the enjoyment of the plot and characterization! Teaching with this edition is a nightmare."
3,"Alright, but not nearly as good as The Mysteries of Udolpho!","I admire the way in which the authoress took all of her threads at the end and made them part of a carpet intricate in design. The heroine was lovable, but the romance between her and her lover was too restrictive and cold that I was often disappointed with it and not convinced, all though perhaps it suits the stereotype of the times, but I doubt I could ever keep my feelings so hidden. Despite my many qualms with the book, it was often exciting, and I do credit Radcliffe's ability to set words on paper. It is a perfect example of the gothic genre."
4,Romance of the English language......,"I didn't love this book with the fervent devotion I love her Mysteries of Udolpho or The Italian, you can tell it was one of her first. Radcliffe's writing improved immensely. I wouldn't start out with this book, read Mysteries of Udolpho first!I am a die hard fan of Radcliffe's, this is another excellent and grand novel."
4,My 2 yr old LOVES this train,"We had to buy this train after our old one broke. It's our 2 1/2 yr old son's favorite toy. Unfortunately, the front wheels keep coming off. My husband super glued it so I'm hoping it will stay. It's a great little train but just be smart and use rechargeable batteries! :)"
2,It makes me see spots!,"The light is very attractive looking and does light the screen effectively, but the glare is horrible! All I can see is the light's reflection in the screen...thus making that area of the screen unviewable. Although it's better than playing in a dark room, this light has serious drawbacks. The light is bendable and can be moved to the edges of the screen, but once the reflection is gone from the screen the other edge of the screen is too dark to see. You can't angle it to avoid the glare. What they REALLY need is two lights...one for each side. This one single light is too focused on a small area. It does look pretty cool though."
5,Wormlight,"The Nyko WormLight is great. It is fully bendable, and doesn't have batteries. It uses the GameBoy's Batteries. None of that tiresome dis-assembling to take out a minute battery.It does glare a tiny bit, but, still, the overall result is great."
1,"A nice idea, but not implemented well...","I bought my kids each one of these at Christmas, so that they could play with their Gameboys in the car when the light was low. Waste of time and money.The light isn't very powerful, doesn't illuminate much of the screen, and seems to suck the batteries dry much sooner. The glare makes my eyes hurt, and I can't imagine it's good for my kids either. We don't use them any more. Don't bother."
3,"Nifty, but annoying glare!","Neat little gizmo in design, but in use, the glare on the gameboy color screen is very bothersome....the cool thing about it, though, is the fact that it runs off the gameboy's batteries, rather than off it's own power source (although, this might be a disadvantage to some, since it will wear out the gameboy batteries much faster)."
3,The glare....,"I don't know why people don't address this issue more... Is it just me, or is no really bothered by the great big glare created by this light?Yes, I aggree this light is really cool... it works off no external batteries, it looks nice, it's bendable..But there's this circular glare on the screen glass... it hovers over the game like the sun...I guess if you play the with it long enough, you learn the phase it out of your vision..."
5,Great Nyko Light,"This thing is great! ... It runs forever, doesn't need batteries, plugs into your link cable slot on the side of your gameboy, you can pick a color that matches with your gameboy, the ""white light"" system cuts down the glare, ... I use it everytime I turn on my gameboy even if the lights are on!"
1,It Eats The Batteries Way Too Much Faster,It eats the batteries way too much faster than normal.It's only recommended for night-time use.
3,Go for the next up,"Like my title says, go for the worm light advance. This one works fine. But after a while of bending, the wire attaching the resistor inside the plug area will snap, which is a pain to replace. The advance version has a circuit board inside, from what i have heard is indestrucable under normal use"
4,May be unbent.,"The worm light that I got (seeing as how it was used) was unbent so it was striaght and not curled like in the picture. however this can be pretty much fixed by wrapping it around a pencil. Please be aware that yours may be the same. Mine still works well, as specified."
3,better than nothing!,"I was making a collection of gameboy items.While browsing, I saw this.I thought it would work well and I could play in the dark. Nevertheless, it did work quite well in pitch dark if u only want to see part of the screen. If there's light nearby,there's also a terrible glare.But it was better than no light at all, so I credit them for that. It's better than other lights out there."
4,Good little light,"This is a good little light -- except for the one glare spot it produces on the screen, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It really does make playing easier, though, once you adjust the light to get the glare spot out of the way. Worth the price."
1,Playing in the dark,"Be careful buying this light. The invoice and order just say Tyko Light. We ordered the Game Boy ""Nyko Worm Light"", but was delivered a Game Boy Color light instead. The genius who designed the GB and GBColor flipped the connectors 180 degrees so you can't use the same light on both GBoys. So, no proof on what we ordered (the invoice just said ""Tyko Worm Light"") and shipping cost of more than the worth of the light, we continue to play in the dark. I have learned a couple of times now that it's best to buy from brick & mortar.Dissappointedly,Playing in the dark!!"
4,Like the blue,"Using a Nyko Worm Light is a very good way to get light on your screen. Although it blocks the screen it's still very useful. It's even a very preety color, blue.This is a must for any gamer."
2,You can be awed by the invetion but don't be fooled.,"I have to admit, this is a pretty nifty invention, but it does not work well with GameBoy. It drains the battery from the GameBoy about 3 times than normal. There is a tremendous glare and the light only covers about half the screen when you change the angle to get rid of the glare. Like any other parent, they'd say it is very bad for your eyes. So when you run to the next room in Zelda, arrows are flying at you and you can't see where they're coming from. You change the angle, find the enemies then you can't find Link. Then you switch back to original angle and by the time you get close enough to the enemy, you're dead. They aren't very flexible and seem so fragile that you don't want to bend it. When I got it in the mail, I was surprised how small it was. Also, if you are playing Pokemon or some 2 player game, the Worm Light blocks up the Link Cable slot. Please, think about this and I highly recommend you not to purchase this item."
4,Awesome!,The WormLight is SSOO cool! If you just plug it in to your Game Boy it turns on! It's that simple. It doesn't need any batteries or chargers... It uses the Game Boy batteries instead! It gives light in a dark/low light area for maximum playing ability. It also looks cool. You can also bend it anywhere. You can't afford to miss this great offer. :^)
4,this stuff is good!,i bought this a few weeks ago and it`s great! i don`t have to buy batteries for this thing. the only problem is that it drains the batteries faster. that`s why i give it 4 stars. if you have a rechargeable battery this gadget works just fine!
5,dreamy & wistful & full of beautiful melodies :),"as another reviewer said, if you like arcade fire then it's a safe bet that you'll like this too"
3,Psuedo- Wolf Parade,"I agree with others who say that this is a less accesible, raw version of wolf Parade. However, I disagree with the assertion that this is a good thing. The thing I absolutely love about Wolf Parade is their creative musicallity which this album really seems to lack. It comes accross as cheap and just too damn quircky in some places. The fact that it's trying hard to be an indie album is transparent and this subtracts from the enjoyment. Think Tom Waits meets Wolf Parade. Both are good in their own right but shouldn't necessarily be mixed."
4,Wolf Parade is radical...,"If you like wolf parade you'll like this album...I like spencer's voice, I don't know why but it reminds me of david bowie."
2,Not for me.,I could not wait to receive it but it gave me a headache and did not smell favorably on me. Passed it on to a friend and she was also turned off by the scent. Ended up in the garbage.
1,Totally useless!,"Kept switching computers on its own. Tried everything I could, but nothing helped. This unit is completely useless. Get the IOGear mini 2 port (the one that includes audio sharing). It's been flawless for me for about 2 months."
1,Very Poor Product,"Not at all reliable - switches on it's own, problems with the button. Very frustrating. At this price it should work much better.Do yourself a favor - keep looking..."
4,Old school Bobby,"This is a great example of old salsa. The album starts off with ""Son Son Charari"", a great song with the hard hitting style that characterized Bobby. ""Guarambembere"" is another rhythmic song with good drum sounds. ""Si Yo te Ame"" and ""Mirate al Espejo"" are boleros that somehow move you. Overall, it's an excellent album with Salsa de la gorda and two boleros that's good from start to finish. And it's from 1968! So, it's 50 years later and the songs still sound great, that my friends is a sign of great music."
2,Don't buy this phone,"I was very disappointed by this phone. I've bought AT&T phones before & liked them, but this one stinks.Most importantly, the ring detect on the phone isn't nearly sensitive enough. The phone doesn't ring on incomming calls to my house. I was told that the wires in my house were probably too long -- yet 2 other phones (from Sony & Siemens) work just fine. Additionally, the menu structure just isn't intuitive. There are too many keystrokes for most simple operations, and adding a phone directory is incredibly frustrating. The directory isn't even alphabetized -- the phone prompts you for the numerical 'slots' in the directory for the number you want -- stupid design.The only thing that saved this phone from a single star was the nice physical design. The phone does feel well-built and comfortble in your hand.Bottom Line - It doesn't ring & it's too hard to use."
1,Do not buy this phone,"I have never had a problem with an AT&T phone before, but the problems with this phone are endless. I had 3 of them, thinking I just had a bad one each time. The phone works great for a while then just stops ringing for no apparent reason. Once this starts, you can no longer get any response from any of the keys."
2,If only it would ring!,"Best thing about this phone is its appearance -- really cute compact design. Apart from that.... the ringing is weird, just as described by reviewers before me; there's a phone directory but it organises numbers numerically, ie #1, #2 etc, instead of alphabetically. How are you meant to remember that Aunt Lucille is #16 and Cousin Gary is #9? Also, I found that its range wasn't great, not as good as phones I've had in the past. I hope AT&T reads all these reviews and does something with the complaints, but keeps the size and design of this phone."
1,Do Not Buy this Phone,"Do not buy this phone at all. The only reason to have a phone is to pick up call, or to make calls. Many times this phone cannot find a ""suitable"" channel to use for calls, so the owner is left unable to either make calls or pick up calls. A waste of money and a stain on the otherwise good AT&T name."
3,Feng Shui for Beginners,Your book is intersting but contradictory to the bagua locations that Karen Carter and Lillian Too wrote. In fact the direction patterns are confusing the bagua locations are not clear. Is the placing of the bagua orientted to the entry from the front door like what Carter is saying or is it based on the compass directions of how your apartment is located. Your book mostly apply for a residential place and not to an apartment setting like the one that I have.
3,Err...Math Geek Alert (haven't bought product yet),"This might get the price bumped, but please note: the 4 oz bottle costs 5 times as much as the 1 oz, so it's better to buy 4 of the 1oz version."
3,Worketh not on xp!,"I have had this for a couple of years and it has worked okay - just like to say I recently upgraded to xp, tried to reinstall - and got told Systemworks was not designed for xp. Doh! Oh yeah, the antivirus is the best part but there is not much else that will make an earthshattering help to your PC. In fact Norton is famous for slowing your computer."
5,Exactly what I expected,"I like this pendent a lot. Pretty color, solid feel and not at all fragile. Does not refract light the way you think a crystal pendant might but for $9 I wasn't expecting that."
2,Not a good deal,"After a few weeks of wear, it turned colors. The yellow part turned a brownish color. Disgusting!!! Needless to say I got about 3 weeks use out of it!"
4,The 1970s gave Sonora Poncena one hit after another.,"This superb compilation covers La Sonora Poncena's 1975-78 recordings and all tracks are culled from their ""Tiene Pimienta"" , ""Musical Conquest"", ""El Gigante Del Sur"" and ""Explorando"" albums. This IS a good compilation (with superb sound quality) but if you know and love Puerto Rican Salsa then you know that the four above-mentioned albums are indispensable masterepieces which should be in your collection."
2,Contains little new,"I really wanted to like this book; normally I just love this sort of outrageously long term speculation. Unfortunately it's mainly a summary/historical review of other people's ideas, and if you're interested in this sort of thing then you've probably seen most of it before. On the other hand, if you're new to this kind of speculation then this book might be a good place to start (so add a star) as it covers a lot of ground without too much detail. The frequent references to science fiction (in particular Olaf Stapeldon's cosmological novels, of which the author is obviously a huge fan) in what initially appears to be quite an academic text is quite unusual, and could lead you to add a few titles to your wish list. The book was originally written in French and I suspect that part of the problem is poor translation; it's just not all that compulsive reading."
4,She Got Me.,"To tell you the truth i was never a nivea fan but i became one after this album. She showed that she had something to say. I really enjoy when i listen to a cd and can relate, and i could with alot of the things Nivea was singing about. This is a good cd and you should give it a try if you want to hear some really nice music. Do your thang Nivea."
3,Confused?!?!,"Ok, I really do like Nivea but it just seems like something is missing on this album. Something like that song she got with R. Kelly on the TP.3 album. On that song her voice is beautiful and its just something about Nivea singin' on an R. Kelly songs that brings the true songstress out of her. I don't really feel that on this album. My favorite 2 tracks are ""Complicated"", and ""Parking Lot"", but overall the album really is just alright. I'm patiently waiting for her to do something spectacular that will make her blow up, but until then I'll just be confused as to why she is not utilizing more seasoned producers in the industry. If its on sale it might be worth it, if its full price I wouldn't."
2,Complicated,"This album is a slight improvement over Nivea's debut, her vocal performance is strong on a few tracks but overall mediocre lyrics and recycled beats created too may filler-ish type tracks and nothing really memorable to help Nivea carve out a niche in the r&b;/hip/pop female division.I agree with a previous poster that R. Kelly seems to give Nivea his throw-away tracks and hope that she can improve her writing skills and/or work with writers & producers who can come up with songs that can better showcase her voice and catchier hooks/beats to capture listeners attention.The tracks that I liked solely for the musical arrangements & beats are: INDIAN DANCE; PARKING LOT & OKAY.IT'S ALL GOOD is a nice up-beat track that makes the best presentation of her vocals; GANGSTA GIRL - I really like this track, especially the guitar riffs & SO FAR - her airy, light vocal performance really sounds great on this track."
1,It Is NOT All Good,"I didn't enjoy ""Complicated"" at all. There is not *one* single song that I like on it. The song ""Okay"" is too girly and stupid with that dumb Lil Jon shouting ""What?!"" and ""Yeah!"" in the background. I don't like Nivea's voice and often times I confuse her with Ashanti since they both sing the same crappy way. Anway, someone is buying this crap and it's not going to be me."
4,No Sophomore Jinx,"Nivea's first album was not that good to me. It was a single album, where the only good songs are the ones that were released. I really liked Okay, though so I decided to give this cd a try. And I am glad I did, she did an amazing job. Most of the songs are hot. She used good beats and her vocals really go well with what she is trying to do. My favorite song is, Okay, the remix. The beat is fly and the song just has a great vibe to it. I see bright things for Niv, in the future, if she keeps doing albums like this."
4,Great album!,"Let me start out by saying that this girl never gets the props she deserves. Complicated is actually one of the best R&B albums that came out this year, but a lot of people will never know because her record label, Jive, doesn't promote her well at all. Don't get me wrong, Complicated isn't grammy award winning material, but its just a great R&B album. I've liked Nivea from the beginning, she can truly sing (which has become rare these days) but this album is much better than her first. My favorites are ""Complicated,"" ""Parking Lot,"" and the ""Okay"" remix (this really should have been a single, it's hot!), but all of the songs on this album are nice."
5,Got this toy to make a playstand more interesting...,"...and it worked! I have a little maroon-bellied conure who's intimidated by larger toys that sometimes say they're intended for ""conure sized birds"". I think they usually mean sun conure - or larger - size. This toy is right for his size (about 60 grams) and he likes to play in it and around it and climb through it. We also tied some ""birdy kabobs"" onto it in a couple of places and a bell we had from another toy he destroyed - and he loves it all the more. The plastic links that hang down the middle are surprisingly fascinating to him. This makes his playstand more interesting and acrobatic. He doesn't preen the ropey bits, but he doesn't really use preening toys as a rule so that doesn't mean your bird won't. I would highly recommend this toy for a bird of his species and curiosity!"
5,"Smoooooooth, Cool, and Hip West Coast Sound","When I first heard this album it captured me. Now that I've expanded my House collection my tastes have changed a little, but I still consider this to be a stellar Deep House album. There are enough memorable tracks on this 2-disc set to easily justify owning it. My favorites are ""Waiting"", ""Next To Me"", ""Don't Stand There"", ""Don't Change"", ""You Can't Stop"", ""Petalpushing"", ""The Remedy"", and ""Lionel's Jam"" (in that order). I own just about everything Migs has put out and I consider this to be his best. If I may drop a sales pitch for a couple of his other works it would be Jay-J & Miguel Migs - In The House and Miguel Migs - Colorful You. This latter one has some incredible R&B tracks. My only criticism of Miguel Migs is that some of his tracks have too much Reggae and Latin/Jazz for my tastes. Nevertheless, he is one of the best DJ/Producers I've ever heard."
2,"like deep house, but this is weak","Weak songs. I like deep house, and there are different variations on it so when I say this has a gay parade sound to it that's the description. Not my cup of tea."
1,compared to Nitin Sawhney? i dont think so,"Nitin Sawhney is at the opposite end of the spectrum with interesting progressive sounds and vocals while Miguel Migs is indeed stuck in '95 with some boring, repetitive, unoriginal waste of time music. its not exciting or novel. its just lame. everyone who has left him a positive review must have been tripping on E when they heard it, since a lot of music sounds really good when you're intoxicated. i am reviewing his Selected Nrk Work 2000-2004 album. not worth the download time."
1,Nothing but a killer,"The first chapter about her most loved servent, Farah is good. After that she gets into her absolute LOVE of killing the animals of Africa. She just loves to hunt. If she sees a lion while driving she will stop and kill it. She kills elephants....she kills everything. I couldn't read any more it was disgusting."
3,"Good, but hard to understand book.","I am a student who was assigned to read this book. The best part of reading it was not the actual reading but the reflection on the various meanings conveyed by the stories. It took me a very long time to read because most of the stories required that you read between the lines to understand the full meaning of the story. Overall, an average book"
1,Missing disk from vendor,"This was supposed to dibe a triple feature Although is was a shrink wrapped product, there was only one of teo disks in the case."
3,Old adventure!!,"I remember seeing these movies as a child and it has taken me back to my childhood. Althought most people would find these movies kind of boring, I have a history with them and this is why I bought them!!!"
2,Trite Deus ex Machina,"Bad guys sneer at multiple pious warnings from good guys that they have the protection of their god/demon/idol Daimajin, and attack them; but sure enough Daimajin totters out and destroys the bad guys, rescuing the good guys. Some running around in the meantime, but nothing that advances anything remotely resembling a plot. Pretty much a Godzilla clone remade as a costume drama."
4,"For the type of movie and price, 4 stars.","If you like this type of movie, you like this movie.That said, once you've seen the first one in this three part series, it's painfully obvious what the story line is for the remaining two. A tiny bit more variation would have gone a long way.BUT, this Triple Feature Collectors Edition Blu-Ray is priced very nicely, so nicely that, even if you NEVER watch the second or third movies, it's still a bargain.So, if you like movies such as Gamera, this should round out your collection quite nicely. I just wish they put a bit more effort into their sequels."
5,Beautiful quality and great deal from Mill Creek,"Highly recommended. Bonus features are great too. Three great period samurai movies with a giant ""monster"" to boot - how can you go wrong? Plus on blu-ray the cinematography is so gorgeous."
4,Fantastic deal!,"This has got to be one of the best deals out there for Kaiju and/or Samurai fans!Not quite sure why the Amazon page lists ""NONE"" under the Special features-this set has one of the most entertaining special features I have ever seen on a genre release. There is well over an hours worth of interview footage with cinematographer/spfx man Fujio Morita. Anyone with an interest in these films will be entertained and enlightened! Mr Morita goes in to great detail, even breaking down individual effects shots explaining how they were done, all subtitled in English. Fascinating! I would love to see more footage of this type on other genre releases.Thanks Mill Creek for an incredibly enjoyable release!"
5,Classic Japanese Film,"Recieved this for Christmas. My wife knows I'm a huge fan of Japanese ""giant monster"" films, and this is one I remember fondly from my childhood. This blu-ray collection has all the Daimajin films, which was known as ""The Giant Majin"" in the US. The picture and sound quality of this film is amazing. The cinematography is first rate, and even my wife says the story line is fantastic (she watched them with me and loved them as well!) A great addition to any serious collector of the genre."
3,Watching the person,I have stopped watching movies that everyone tells me are good. I am now watching the stars I enjoy seeing. I bought this because Lou Diamond Phillips was in it. For that reason I enjoyed it and so did my friends.
4,Lone Rider,"This is an action western with Lou Diamond Phillips. He's up to doing his usual fantastic acting job. It's a ""Keeper!"""
2,"Not good, just bad and ugly.","This is the worst kind of made for TV / straight to DVD trash western out there. I can't believe this ever got a positive review. If you're looking for something that blows this nonsense out of the water, try ""Open Range"" with Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner. It's a real shame, because Lou Diamond Phillips is capable of a lot better."
4,Westerns revisited,"First up, I confess to being a fan of the westerd genre, particulary those from the 50s and 60s. That said, I enjoyed Lone Rider. It is most definitely not a revionist western. Modern, certainly but with a respect to the golden age. The white hat/black hat theme is continued here. As are most westerns this one is about the baddies getting their comeuppance at the hands of a reluctant hero, in this caseLou Diampnd Phillips. He carries the part well, as he usually does. Everything you could wish for is here, horse chases, shootouts, robbery and naturally murder. I almost forgot, two lovely female leads. The location shooting is filmed beautifully. I recommend this one to all lovers of good westerns. Enjoy!"
5,"Easy as 1, 2, 3...",This DVD is a great learning tool for any level of modeler. I used the information for building a war-gaming table but the information is universal to any hobbyist interested in creating their own terrain or dioramas. Each step in the process is clearly laid out and presented. The book of the same name serves as an excellent supplement for this video and really should be purchased together.
5,A wonderful Coda to a marvelous career....,"I don't mind when people say ""Laura who""??? I tell them anyway. I tell them of a woman with the voice of an angel, the soul of poet and strength of a Goddess. Whether they ""get it"" or not doesn't matter to me. Laura's been part of my life since 1972 when I first heard ""Gonna Take a Miracle"" on a friends turntable and she's been part of my life ever since. A true ""American Master"" forever destined to be a ""prophet without honor"" in her own land. Where's the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, where's her special Grammy? Phah it's enough to make you sick.This album of cover's and originals is a marvelous bow surrounding a wonderous career. She may not have had the hits or sold the records but by God she wrote the songs!!! Her voice brings me to tears, her picture is the only one on my mantlepiece. Buy this album, listen to the last song... wait for the coda and thank God she graced our lives as long as she did."
4,Songs that Resonate...,"I first heard Ms. Nyro years ago with Eli and the Thirteenth Confession and really enjoyed those New York arrangements by Callelo. Over the years I forgot about that wonderful sound and the good feelings they gave me... Now we have the latest; though sadly the last, of Laura Nyro's music. The happy news is that this CD has songs that resonate with different emotions easily worth your time and money. The liner notes, I think, should be read after listening to the music first. You'll see what I mean when you have this CD in your hands. To sum it up: Ms. Nyro has left us a disc of sounds that are at once happy, sad, melancholy, joyous, and new-york-hip. A glimpse at a life, a peek at a great composer."
5,"pure laura as a ""mature"" artist",She was mature with her first album but she grew into a woman--wise and wonderful. She was always considered sad but there was always so much joy in her saddness. This is a real collection of Laura the singer and such a gift she left behind. The more I listen to it the more I hear. I agree this is probably her most intimate album ever.
1,Not worth the money at all.,"Buy the book if you want to know how NOT to design a C++ OpenGL classes for Windows. The book makes a big (and common) mistake of integrating OpenGL rendering context management into CView derived object, as if OpenGL could render to CView window only! You cant find very important Windows specific issues in the book, like rendering to DIB section and using it to integrate OpenGL rendering with Windows and GDI. Full screen rendering issues are also not covered. You also won't find any WindowsNT specific issues (like rendering to enhanced metafile)."
3,Good but not satisfied,!!Good Things!! (1) Kind explains about relations between OpenGL and Windows 95/NT (2) A lot hints for optimization (3) examples with MFC -This book is only one now- !!Bad Things!! (1) Not sufficient example programs (2) Too kind but long explains - It was somewhat difficult that for non native english speaker to understand- (3) does not cover whole of OpenGL - But you can find breif comments-!!My opinion!! It's good book. But I wish author write 2nd Edition more detail.
2,An introductory text for the technical novice,"I do not recommend this book for anyone with an engineering or math related background. Mr. Fosner makes several comments to the effect that matrix algebra is really not that hard (it isn't) and steps around a simple explanation of the transforms. The definition of the Model-View transform was obscure. A Nutshell Book treatise ... clear, concise and to the point ... would be preferable to the chatty format. If you know nothing about OpenGl and are paranoid about linear algebra, then this is the book for you.ajg"
1,pass.,"OpenGL Programming for Windows 96 and Windows NT sacrifices technical information for amateur hand-holding. The included CD which ""...contains all source code and projects from the book..."" is incomplete and makes annoying assumptions about the user's development platform"
2,Not a good idea to buy this book...,"I am fairly new to programming, although I have a pretty good understanding of C++ and Windows programming with MFC (Thanks to ""Programming Windows with MFC"" by Jeff Prosise). The stuff in this book about windows and MFC won't teach you how to program with either - you'll need another book for that. I, being 16 years old, don't have much of a mathematical background, and the authors explanations did nothing more than confuse me. I seriously think they forgot to put in a couple of chapters... The other reviews are correct - the author is not very clear, and he I don't think he could explain why 1 + 1 = 2. If you want to learn how to program windows, or if you want to learn MFC, don't buy this book. If you can understand even the worst explanations, maybe you can get something from this book... All I got from it was the CD with some sample programs on it."
4,taken a long time,These things have taken a really long time to come in the mail. The ultra sensitive part scares me because it might break... lets hope not!!
3,Benjy is Friendly,"What if you could see ghosts? Wouldn't that be pretty scary? Well Benjy can. Benjy is very easy to become friends with even if he does not think so, in the book Ghost Cadet by Elaine Marie Alphin.The first clue that made me think that Benjy is friendly is because he befriended a ghost named William. That seems like it would be kind of hard to do to me. Secondly, he made friends with his grandma (Miss Leota) which his sister probably could not have done, even if her life depended on it. The final reason that made me think he's affectionate is because he made a friend quickly with Colonel Samuel Edbridge Marshall when he really needed to.Overall, I thought this book was pretty good. Although it was a bit boring in some parts, I still liked reading it. Now I hope you agree with me and think Benjy is friendly.6th grade student at OHES"
3,chad's award winning review,This book is about a boy named Benjy who is visiting his grandma in Virgina.While there he meets this ghost at an old battle field. During the rest of the story Benjy is helping this ghost to find this watch that he hid at the battle field.I think this is a ok book .I think that this would be a goodbook for a fourth or fifth grader.
3,"Graham, Jessie, Sean, Tamera, Joe","This book had a lot of information on the Civil War and the battle of New Market.It told quite a bit about the life of the cadet William Hugh McDowell.We were all excited when the star of the book; Benjy Stark, went to the battle that is ""redone"" every anniversery of the well known date in New Market.We were also proud of Benjy when he bolded his feelings to be brave and work through scary times. Benjy thought that he wouldn't make it, but he worked though the horror."
4,An interesting book on the Civil War,"The book, Ghost Cadet, is really interesting, especially if you've ever visited New Market and VMI. My Mom bought the book for me after we had visited the area, and I found it very interesting. The ghost character, Hugh McDowell, was really a VMI Cadet, which also helps make the book more interesting, so the author did her research well. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the boring parts about Benjy's divorced parents and how nobody liked Benjy. I thought that this took away from the story line because it was too depressing."
2,Lonley Benjy,"Do you believe in ghosts? If you do, then this book by Eliane Marie Alphin is the right book for you. Unfortunately, I did not really like it. It is too hard to believe. Benjy Stark is a twelve year old boy who has no friends at all.This little boy has to go to his grandmother's house that he hasn't even seen before. He is not thrilled, but he goes anyway. But, on the other hand, his sister, Fran, does not want to go at all. She ends up having to go anyway. While they are there, Benjy goes on some pretty cool adventures after all.For example, Benjy finally meets a young boy named William Hugh McDowell. They get along great, but the weird thing is that William isn't a boy, he is a ghost. If you want to read more about Benjy and his adventures read this book.6th Grade Student from OHES"
1,so thin I had to send it back,"I love the design, but the product is so thin I was embarrassed to give it to my mom. A shame they didn't up the quality."
4,worked well,"I needed two ten foot benches to fill an area on my patio. I purchased 3 sets of bench ends and used 3 bench ends per bench, 1 on each end and 1 in the middle. It worked really well. The product specifies to use 2 x 4's for bench seat, back and supports but I used 5/4"" cedar decking for the seat and back and used 2 x 4's for the supports. This is a very reasonable cost way to have a lot of seating."
3,My homemade chair.,I think this item is a good idea. All the more reason I bought it. But it was hard to line up the wood in the right place and after it chair was done oneone wanted to sit on it. I feel it was a waste. Now the item to make a table would be a better idea.
5,My son & I rate this book #1!!,"I really hope the author and illustrator read this review so they will know how much their book is loved!... The rhymes are fun to read and the illustrations are gorgeous. My son is clearly entranced by the pictures and loves to look at them by himself. The book contains a few animals we don't see in other books (moles, spiders) which I like - it is nice to have a break from cows/horses/etc. The pictures are also fairly realistic...."
5,Wonderful small board book for 6 months and up,"I am pleased ""Off We Go"" is now offered as a board book for a very young child. I have the larger hardcover paper page edition but gave my 9 month old granddaughter the smaller board book. She loves the lyrical rhyming and it is a book that can be read over and over again-""Scritch-scratch, scritchity scratch,Directly from the egg I hatch"" Sings Little Duck.A great book for any grandparent to receive or to give as a gift."
1,Waste of Time and Money,This product is poorly documented and technical support is nonexistent. It generates cryptic error codes and provides no support for resolving them. Don't waste your time or money on it.
1,Don't waste your money,There were so many errors in this book that I don't know where to begin. Anyone who has read any other spiritual book will find this book roddled with errors and Christian dogma. Not recommended.
4,Same Book as another title,"I, too, enjoyed this book. However, if you already possess _Crusader Knight_, then save your money. Both books are the exact same. Different titles, different cover art; but, the same text and photos on the exact same numbered page.Buy one or the other -- great book -- but do not buy both."
4,Very Good Overview,"Well researched; good details in the ""expanded"" views; however, I really prefer Rothero or McBride to the overall artistic style of Hook. Otherwise, still a very good resource."
5,Great plates,"This book discusses the military elite of the faltering Catholic Kingdoms of the Middle East following the Battle of Hattin and the capture of Jerusalem by Salah al-Din, as seen in the Kingdom of Heaven. It has the usual excellent twelve pages of artwork by Christa Hook."
4,Roberto was there in the beginning....,"1972, the year of release of #4, was a crucial year at the very beginning of the Salsa era. While recorded in Puerto Rico, it benefitted from the boom that was going on in New York. The vinyl release was on the INTERNATIONAL label, a sub-label the Fania folks created for their Puerto Rico-based bands. Produced by Johnny Pacheco, the salseros of old will remember the radio hits Con Los Pobres Estoy, Las Brisas de mi Borinquen, and the classic charanga-style No Me Hagas Sombra, where The Apollo Sound mimics Orquesta Aragon. with Tito Cruz on lead vocals, this is a record at the heart of the music movement we know as salsa. One of the best by Roberto Roena.Another favorite by the band is Lucky 7."
4,Just what I was looking for,"All I wanted was simple and the T-Trove burner is just that. I only wish it was a litlle bigger. I have to snap the ends off of Satya's 1 gram sticks for it to catch all the ash.I do recommend this burner to anyone who hates cleaning up the ashes that fall from the wooden burners, and to those who feel the bottle burners just don't let enough aroma out."
2,inane characters and many flaws,"The good is that there are lots of games. The bad is that your opponents and partners, (worse) seem to be morons. The bidding in the bridge section is terrible. I was stuck with this game for many weeks and so got to know it. It is hard to figure out why your partner made a particular bid afterwards. There is also a flaw (for my IMAC at least) in the pinochle game that freezes up the game after the second time the game is played. I sent an email to the company complaining, no response ever. Frustrating programs."
5,New Illustrated Treasury of Disney Songs (Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook),I really have enjoyed this piano book!! I love playing the songs from it and have gotten my money's worth from it multiple times!
4,this book is lots of fun,"This Disney song book is fun and easy to play. It's not a fake bookbut the songs are sort of shortened, which I didn't like very much. However, it's still a great book. There is a history of how they included music into the Disney movies and cartoons. There are even songs to the Disney afternoon cartoons. There are a few full paged illustrations and each song title has a illustration next to it. I definitely recommend this book to Disney song lovers out there."
3,I wish I could wear it more often...,"I love the look and feel of this necklace, however the little beads all have rough edges & the gaps between them pinch my skin & pull my hair out. I cannot wear this necklace...it would be fine over clothing, but not on direct skin."
1,did not work,I have an SGH t509 and this cable did not even work with this phone. All it will do is charge. It was a complete waste of time and money.
5,Good Choice!,"My son loved it. He is having so much fun with it. Easy to operate and very accurate. It is very powerful, split our fence. He's excited to be able to add adtional items to bow, increasing it's accuracy."
3,to much money for 5 co2 cartridges,1.co2 is great2.too much money for this item3.should be worth at least $7 bucks4.i personally think co2 cartridges should be worth a dollar
1,what?,Did someone just sit in their hotel room one night and said lets make a band called f()ck? and they had a guitar and a computer and in one night made a whole album like that? cuz thats what it sounds like
3,Not L'Amour's Best,"This book stumbles around from one scene to the next, trying to find its stride. There are plenty of bad guys, and there's lots of gun action, but there's no sense that it's going anywhere. It just wanders from here to yonder. Which is a shame, because Tell Sackett is my favorite L'Amour character. I loved him in ""Mojave Crossing,"" where he takes up with the spicy Dorinda. But in ""Sackett,"" which came first, we meet his pathetic, whining, helpless girlfriend, Angie. I hope he doesn't marry her in a later book! He could do so much better!"
1,"Woman, get a clue about reality",This gal is taking Weight Watchers to court. I wouldn't suggest anyone waste a penny buying this dribble whe writes!
2,meh...,"I have read dozens of books regarding body issues & weight, & this book was a disappointment. I couldn't even finish it--it seemed dated(as it should, I think it was written in 70's/80's),and boring... It could be that I've read all the great books on this subject first(Geneen Roth, Sheryl Canter, etc)& that by the time I read FIFI, it was nothing new to me."
2,irrelevant,"A proper title for this book is 'how to make your 70's car handle'. The book is very out of date and was very generic. There is some information that relates to the new cars, my advise is save your money."
1,check the year published,"Saw the title to this book and really wanted an in depth description of suspension dynamics. The book does go into this info.After receiving the book, I noticed recommended shocks were Monroe Load Levelers and Gabriel gas matics. I'm more interested in coil overs. If you have a 1970's or older car and plan to race Vintage Car Class, you may find this book useful. I however will be continuing to use it to prevent my bedroom door from closing."
3,Old school concepts of car setup and handling,"This book covers the all-important fundamentals of suspension setup, stabilizer bars, aerodynamics and associated down force, tires and weight distribution. I bought this book because I could not find my 30 year old Porsche suspension books and I was trying to refresh my mind on this subject. If you are a purist you will enjoy and understand these concepts and you will understand modern suspension setups a lot better. You will be a better driver too."
5,DVD is FAR superior to CD versions. Period.,"Why in the world would ANYONE prefer a CD version over a DVD version? There is actually a review that says DVD is ""slower"". Is that person from another planet? Are we talking the same technology here? DVD blows CD versions away with FAR more data space and NO DISC SWAPPING! Baldur's Gate is a game with a LOT of disc swapping...unless you have a DVD-Rom. With the DVD version there is NO disc swapping. NONE. Ask yourself how that could possibly be slower. DVD games, including this one, are the BEST format for games. Get them while you can, they can be hard to find."
3,My only concern is the heat shield.,"First off, this will fit 02-05 Chevrolet Trailblazers, despite the ""Make sure it fits"" tells you it won't. Installation was pretty easy, the only this I would recommend is purchasing a small hose clamp to add to the crankcase vent tube (one doesn't come with the kit). Sound is pretty low key unless you really stomp on it, then it becomes very noticeable, and will certainly drown out your radio.The heat shield is really bare bones, though, and this intake still gets hot to the touch with the heat shield in place. I will probably hollow out the stock airbox to insulate the filter better, as the point of a cold air intake is to, well, intake COLD air. Knocked two stars off the product for that."
3,Not as detailed as I would think,"This is a decent atlas, but definitely not as detailed as the ones in the US. It also took 3 weeks to receive this item which was 10 days longer than the other 2 books ordered on the same day. It did arrive in the time window, but 3 weeks - I heard of snail mail, but come on!"
4,Just what you'd expect,"I'm planning a driving tour of New Zealand, and finding good consistant maps has been a challenge. This atlas is just like you'd expect - large pages with readable notations and plenty of close-up city maps."
2,If you love your child don't buy this!,"We have had this crib for just over two years now. I noticed before that it nicked and scratched pretty easy. Well, this morning I woke up to my 26mnth old son SCREAMING! When I went into his room, one of the bars has snapped in half and then completely off. He was stuck in between the two remaining bars, head inside the bed and body dangling outside! I was so upset! I had to push his body back up through the bed! My poor angel was still screaming. He's never been rough with the bed and I don't know how the bar snapped like that! I just know that I will NEVER purchase a crib like this or recommend it to anyone. I am also going to contact the maufacturer so other parents don't end up with the same problem!"
4,Good crib for the price,"We've only had this crib for about a month, so I can't speak for the long term durability, but so far it seems to be fine. My husband and I assembled it in less than half an hour with no problems, and our 4 month old is very happy. One note of caution - purchase this item in the store, not online, and unpack it at the store to be sure every single panel is in good shape. Ours had two damaged panels - one that had been damaged in shipping, one that had clearly been damaged in the factory since they stained the dinged-up area. We had to go to two different Babies R Us stores to gather enough good pieces to make one crib, and even then we had to settle for slightly bowed rails on one fixed side."
3,Not the Best,"Sometimes my eyes feel drier very soon after using this. Not sure why... That doesn't happen with TheraTears or the regular solution by Refresh. I find TheraTears works best for me. I use drops throughout the day, before bed, and upon waking."
2,May work for some - not for me,"I have no doubt that this product may work well for some people. Unfortunately, I have to echo the negative reviews on here. This product makes my eyes sting, makes them feel sticky, and ultimately worsens my dryness symptoms. I have no problem with other brands such as Blink or Systane - the latter of which works best for me. All eyes are different though, so try to find what works best for you!"
5,If you have dry eyes,Use it a few times a day. Really seems to help with dry eyes. Was recommended by my eye doctor.
5,interesting perspective by a great author,"love this author... just need to find a few more books to complete my collection!! And, looking for great authors writing novels of same period"
3,Slow Read,"I wasn't impressed with this book, I got bored at about half way thru and didn't finish it. Just didn't seem anything like what I have read about Anne of Cleves."
4,history could have been different,"If Henry VIII hadn't made a snap judgment about Anne of Cleves & rejected her, he would have found he had an excellent wife. They probably would have had a son who would have been king after the sickly Edward. There wouln't have been a Mary I or Elizabeth I; no Stuart kings, Hanovers, etc.I DID notice one error, at least if Wikipedia has it right. It says that Anne's younger sister never married. The novel says she did; which made me wonder about other things. If authors don't want to stick to what is known, they probably should write about completely imaginary characters."
3,Please note: this is NOT a biography!,"I am fascinated by this woman who not only married Henry VIII for a short period of time and lived to tell about it, but seemingly became close to the King, as well.Yes, this book is a descent read, but I was disappointed a few pages in when I realized this was ""Tudor Fiction"" and not an actual biography of Anne of Cleves. The description does say it is a fictional account, but I didn't read that far into it before I clicked ""Add to cart"".Lesson learned? Read thoroughly before ordering!"
2,Okay when your options are limited,"I purchased this book while on vacation. While much of the book is factually correct some of the language is off, she uses 'em rather than them, and the supposed relationships between Anne of Cleves and the men that surrounded her are figments of an over active imagination. If you have no other options it is a decent read but if you are deciding between this and another book you really want to buy, choose the other book."
4,Gracious Survivor,"Before Sharon Kay Penman, there was Margaret Campbell Barnes. I am delighted that many of her works are lately being republished and reread by a whole new generation of lovers of historical fiction. Barnes has the knack for engendering terrific sympathy for her main characters, and this one is no exception. We get an intimate look at poor Anne, enlisted to be Henry VIII's next wife at a time when that was tantamount to a death sentence. Anne's grace under fire and consequent development of a resolute and courageous nature helps her literally keep her head while navigating the treachery of the Tudor court. Anne is pictured here in a loving and quite believeable way, as are the many other historical figures that populate these pages. Reading a Barnes novel is a wonderful way to combine history with real human drama. She eschews the hysterical and opts for the dignified, resulting in a wonderful tour through this colorful time in English history. Recommended."
4,The best...,Got this an amazon after being told by my prenatal yoga teacher that it is the best. Amazon offers the best price. We had one for a year that we bought in the store and we bought the second one on amazon. The 65 cm one is perfect for sitting on to use our computer and bounce our baby to sleep. Wish the color was more neutral to match our decor better but that is really the only flaw.
3,shiva rea,"Fun practice, but a bit on the "" hollywood"" side. My personal taste is on the ""down to earth"" side. At any rate, I think this dvd will be enjoyed by most."
4,Like Shiva hate dancing,"Shiva RAe is one of my favorite yoga instructors for that reason I would buy anything with her name on it. I don't quite get the whole trance concept however, I tried the Matrix option letting all the dancing parts out and had a blast. The next day I was sore in places I didn't even know I had. It is different lots of new movements and you do end with a sense of freedom. The scenery is amazing as always with her DVD's"
2,Use with care,"I have Shiva Rea's yoga shakti and loved it, bought this assuming it would be on the same lines - I tried it with my 19 year old niece who is not a practised yoga student and she sprained a neck muscle. Yoga and Dance may be a creative mix but somewhat like mixing oil and water - yoga is meant to induce stillness and stretch the body/mind, dance is about movement - shifting from one pose to another itself in yoga should be done with care and with time/attention. Only very experienced dancers or yoga practitioners can just 'let loose' and wiggle body parts in combination with yoga poses thrown in.Shiva should have put in a warning at least or just made it a dance video, not mixing it like this for users of all experience levels."
1,The dancing makes me feel stupid,"I agree with the other reviewer: the dancing segments made me feel stupid. All Shiva says is something along the lines of ""move your body, let it flow, let the sun/air/breath move you. Move. Flow."" On the screen, you see her and the other dancers just dancing, and I had a hard time free flowing to the music. I felt stupid trying, and after a minute, just sat down and watched. When I bought this dvd, I assumed that there were going to be instructional dance movements that incorporated yoga into it somehow, and that is not the case.I'm not using this dvd. What a waste of money.I do, however, like her Creative Core Abs and Yoga Shakti dvds and recommend those."
2,I was disappointed,"Yes, this was a good workout for your heart. But I felt stupid doing it. I felt like I couldn't follow along very well, and that I was like a chicken flapping my arms and feet around, lol. The yoga section I really liked, but the dancing part I was not so fond of."
3,"Seems ok, but not for me.","I just couldn't really follow Shiva's instruction that well. She kind of just assumes you know what you are doing. Also the ""trance"" dance part of the DVD kind of hurt my neck. Overall, the production is beautiful and the music is cool, but just not my go-to DVD. I will probably keep trying it to see if it gets better with practice, but the first few times I lost interest and felt lost! Note: I do yoga regularly and dance, so it was surprising that I would find this DVD hard to follow!"
1,SERIOUSLY!!!,"...I mean seriously!!!why would any one in the world want to purchase such thing! AND why would anyone even give a one star to this!!I've been doing yoga and eastern dance for years now, and this is nothing like yoga or dance or anything else!I'm just shocked at this very moment and all I can say is that, before buying this weird dvd, watch the trailer on amazon!"
2,misleading trailer - be careful,"I saw a trailer for this on my Bollywood workout dvd, and thought it would be OK. I have a number of injuries that have left me with limited movement. The trailer showed very gentle movements from a standing position. But right from the beginning, you must be able to go straight down to the ground or mat - gracefully - and there is no slow working up to it. Many years ago, i watched and worked out with Richard Hittleman's PBS yoga show, and he emphasized working up to things slowly. None of that here. So I will find someone to give it to. If you are looking for an exercise video that allows you to go slowly - this is probably not for you."
5,joyful movement,"I'm really enjoying this dvd. I have been practicing yoga for over 10 years but was recently feeling like my body wanted more free movement. This dvd is a great introduction to prana yoga and trance dance - especially for those of us who are too self conscious to move like this in a class. There is just the right amount of instruction balanced with opportunity to do whatever your body wants to do. The music is energizing and the scenery is interesting as well. The matrix format allows for a customizable workout and limitless combinations so you don't get bored. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who is open to or already loves experimenting with yoga, dance, and movement."
3,well done but..........,I bought this a long time ago and it is collecting dust. It is a really good quality production but I find it hard to get into on a tv screen. The opening yoga has a lot of writhing around creativly which is kind of hard to follow and the dance I would enjoy just as much with any good music without dvd and comments. I think you have to be there to really feel it. peace to you and me.
3,New Fan,"I've never bought a Blake Babies CD until this, and did so based on some positive reviews I had read in various publications. After downloading ""Disappear""... I knew I had to have it.The songs are instantly catchy and likable. I can put this CD and not have to skip over any tracks to get to a more favored one. It makes great background music while doing stuff around the house. I must confess that I don't think it has much staying power. In a few weeks I'll probably be over it and will be filed away with all the other CD's I rarely listen to. So I'll enjoy it for now, and in a few years, dust it off and relive some memories of '01."
4,I miss the old Blake Babies,"""God Bless the Blake Babies"" is a lovely effort. Its songs are melifluous and pleasing. I am happy to have bought the album. But I must admit I was a huge Blake Babies fan circa ""Earwig"" and ""Sunburn,"" and compared to those albums, I am disappointed. ""God Bless . . ."" is like a color reproduction of the Blake Babies. The essential elements that led me to like the early albums--interesting twists on lyrics; beautiful silky vocals; skillful instrumentation--are all there, but they lack a certain crisp edge and conviction. ""God Bless . . ."" is too mature for my taste. Give me a little more unrequited love, anguish and puerile anger. That's the Blake Babies stuff I _loved_."
5,A Hidden Treasure,"The other reviewers describe this book well. I have collected natural health books for over 35 years. Been using this one for about 9 years now There are quite a few health books that have served me well. Of those, this book is my favorite.So many people still have a pills and potion concept about health, which is why so many ""health food"" stores limit their stock to pills and potions. This is not a book for those people. This is a book for people who want to cultivate healthy habits and reap the benefits. It is the best guide to eradicating parasites that I have ever seen. No expensive packaged pills and potions necesarry. Of course, it is so much more. A great gift to yourself and anyone interested in natural health, novice or experienced."
4,You'll laugh your PANTS off!,"This will definitely be the ""gateway"" film for Talkington. This movie is so quotable you'll want to watch it over and over to make sure you get all the gems in it. From the Wikipedia discussion over ""punk"" at the bar to the heart-to-heart behind bars, this movie made me wish I was in the family room playing Perquacky with all the wacky Hagans and Raff... and the music in the film is awesome."
1,Trashy,"The Night of the White Pants is a waste of film and your money, unless you do not mind your brain and soul being used as a garbage dump!Naomi Richardson"
4,informative in words but not multimedia,"It is not easy to make a choice between Britannica and Encarta, but I finally buy this one.First of all, this is the encyclopedia I usually use in school and I always found it is useful. I guess the content will not disappoint me and it is as expected. with over 80,000articles in two cds, the multimedia is the opportunity cost. I think the image is not enough, I read swordfish and it doesn't show me a picture. although the print version has no picture as well, I think it is necessary. there are some minor bugs with the program but it is generally stable. I recommend this product to the serious learners."
3,"Great on hard subject matter, lame on view-based subjects","Very good on hard subject matter, like science, medicine, mathematics. But it is certainly lacking in soft areas, like history, politics.The interface is too constricting in its article presentations.I, too, notice the multiple clicking needed to get thru articles.Tho history and politics are well-known for their inexactness and historians and politicians are known for their sometimes criminal slantedness, I do think Britannicas researchers should try at least a little harder to present balanced, unslanted historical and political information."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the package. They didn't really make an effort to incorporate multimedia like you would expect. I prefer the Encarta deluxe. Encarta deluxe gives me better search results and has the multimedia components one would expect from a computer encyclopedia - and Encarta is slightly more user friendly. In defense of Britannica they have better writers than Encarta in terms of writing style, but the information content is about the same."
1,A very disappointing program,"Encyclopedia Britannica have failed to take advantage of multimedia. There are only a handful of video references, many of low quality. Monochrome images are all dark for some reason.The poorly designed interface has some bugs which should have been worked out. I bought the DVD version and one reason was for the world atlas, which is the most disappointing aspect of the package. I have seen better freeware atlases. Detail is extremely poor. Encarta atlas beats this easily. I wish I could say something nice about the application, but I honestly cannot!"
1,Only a reminder of a once great encyclopedia,Anyone who used the great printed Encyclopedia Britannica of the 1940s to 70s will find this electronic issue a great disappointment. The comprehensive essays and in-depth discussions just are not there. In many cases I found a three-year old one-disk Encarta and a printed twenty-year old World Book more interesting and useful.
2,Not as good as I thought,"The book covers a LOT of topics but it assumes too much. Even on Chapter 1 the author discusses topics that I didnt know about. Name of the book is ""Network Tutorial""; bad name. I would call it Networks Unleashed. It also seems a bit outdated to me, the latest edition was released in Jan/2003, yet there is too much talk about Windows 3.1, OS/2 and NT. Linux and XP are rarely mentioned. I dont recommend it, its good but not worth the price tag."
2,"Fabulous music, dismal sound quality","Gene Krupa's music is a marvel, but unfortunately, the sound quality on this disc is horrifying. Throughout every song, there is an audible, annoying hiss in the background. My old collection of 33 RPM disc's produces fresher sounds than this pathetic excuse of remastering. It's obvious they merely transfered the original mono recordings from vinyl to CD with no remastering or technical wizardry. It's a crying shame because Krupa's band is an underrated orchestra. Do yourself a favor and sample Krupa's music, but not from this poorly produced, shoddy CD."
1,Deceptive description,"What you receive if you order this is quite different from what is described.This dvd came with only one resistance band. The video accompanying it does not explain how to use the resistance bands. Instead, it shows excercises that have to be performed standing up and that do not make use of a resistance band. There is no address on the packaging or on the Funcersice website to which a complaint or return can be sent.I am sure the exercises on the video are good for fully ambulatory young people. For seniors with arthritis who have trouble standing, the video is worthless. I guess I can figure out how to use the resistance bands, but there is nothing to show me."
3,seniors funcercise - strength training with Sunshine,"The exercises are appropriate for the targeted age group. One of the two bands provided with the DVD, however, is far too short to comply with the video as shown. Laying flat, the band is just over one foot in length doubled and should be at least two and a half times as long. When sitting, one is directed to place band under the outstretched feet and pull hands up to ones chin - impossible with that short band. If an additional band is available, I would appreciate receiving one. Thanks."
1,A Little Too Aggressive for Senior Beginner,"I didn't even get halfway through and was too worn out to continue. The format of the DVD is poor, it's irritating to watch and is far too aggressive for an over 50 person who is out of shape and just starting with bands. Most of the time you don't know which band you should be using. It doesn't have options for ""if you're just starting, do it this way..."" Sorry, but I did not like this DVD at all."
3,resistance bands too short,"I like the tape, it is easier than some of my other ones. It is a good one when you are just getting back into the grove. Only complaint is the resistance bands are too short for me."
4,A Uniquely Different Type of Polish Comedy,"""Kitsch"" is a uniquely different type of film. It is about two men and their cameraman (who you rarely see) who know little to nothing about making movies and who fool beautiful women into thinking they are stars in their production. Overall, the film is senseless; but in the chaos, it all adds up into something that takes another shape, one that makes sense.Throughout the movie, the two guys make this film funny by interspersing their commentary on cinema. The men act a little silly occasionally and even look a little goofy, which makes it hard not to find amusement in their antics. The women are hilarious because they take them serious.Without a doubt, ""Kitsch"" is funny. It is a goofy kind of humor, but it is loaded with it! If you thought you have watched enough Polish films about making a film, here is another, but one that takes a unique spin on the idea."
2,Fright Night Remake With A Werewolf,"It's not like Fright Night, it IS Fright Night with werewolves. They literally stole a lot from Fright Night and just changed the characters and made the movie about a werewolf. I was so disappointed that I didn't write this movie and get paid for it. I didn't know you could steal ideas and change just a little and make it a movie. The movie itself isn't that bad for what it is, but I just couldn't believe how unoriginal the movie was. Watch Fright Night (it's better anyway) and you will definitely see all of the similarities."
4,AN AROUSING FILM MINUS KEVIN SORBO!,NINA DOBREV & PETER STEBBINGS ARE HOT ON SCREEN TOGETHER!!! ALTHOUGH NINA WAS ONLY 16 YRS OLD. THE EROTICISM BETWEEN THEM WAS DYNAMIC BUT BRIEF. KEVIN SORBO AS A COMEDIC ELEMENT IN THIS FILM WAS A WASTE OF TIME. IF THIS HAD BEEN A SERIOUS DRAMA IT WOULD HAVE HAD GREAT POTENTIAL.
4,I Loved This Movie! It's Worth The Time And The Dime,"This movie rocked! I don't know about you guys, but I loved Fright Night, so I didn't mind a few similarities! It was gory yet sexy as well! I don't think you will be disappointed with this one. If you liked Dog Soldiers, you will like Never Cry Werewolf!"
3,COPIED FRIGHT NIGHT!,"This movie basically copies Fright Night (which it can't begin to compare with). Everything from the beast next door to the smoke around just the house the beast lives in to the so-called beast hunter. Fright Night had a vampire, this had a wolf. F.N. had a male high school student as the hero, NCW had a female hero. NCW was kind of weak and corny. FN was a much better movie! I was surprised Kevin Sorbo (Hercules) was in this!"
2,"Huff, n' Puff, n' blow it down!","Where to begin with this one. I did not really expect too much from this...for me the selling point was KEVIN SORBO! ( I kid u not...hey...what can I say...I love cheese..and the title and the lead actor made this dvd smell like Gouda)This one had pretty poor story line, somewhat predictable with that 1980's feel to it. The flick was a write off until the middle of the film when headline actor KEVIN SORBO makes his appearance, and he is in the rest of the flick too! After ex Hercules actor makes his screen presence this booger picks up and hilarity and sci fi action ensue. This is not going to win any oscars folks..but it was very very entertaining.If I had it to do again...ID WATCH IT!!"
3,This one is worth a look.,"I watched this on the SciFi Channel and thought it was reasonably well done. Nina Dobrev is charming as the girl who suspects her next door neighbor is a werewolf. Kevin Sorbo adds humor to the proceedings as a big game hunter who isn't as brave as his reputation would lead you to believe.The make-up effects are adequate, and the gore is kept to a minimum. This would make satisfying viewing for a rainy day."
5,Never Cry Werewolf,Never Cry Werewolf is a good movie and for this to be a used dvd the picture was very excellent.
4,Pretty good movie.,I liked this movie. I originally bought it because Nina Dobrev was in it. I think some of the acting could of been better.
5,Gripping scary movie,"I saw this the other day on the sci-fi channel. I could not stop watching it.I know some people may think this is a lame, cheesy picture, but I was mesmerized.I am not a horror fan, but I loved this show. My only dislike would be the heroin's boyfriend is totally lame. He is goofy and just blah. I know she is supposed to hate the werewolf, but hey, he is so much more attractive, despite the evilness, than her boyfriend.It may not be the best wolf movie out there, but I was hooked."
3,Not the Best Werewolf Movie Ever But...,"I will admit that the main reason I watched this movie is to see Peter Stebbings. That said, it's not the best werewolf movie I've ever seen but it's cool. It's more geared towards teens and it's solution is too simple for my taste. But, since it is a teen movie and there isn't a lot of time spent on the back story of the mysterious neighbor, I suppose I should be happy with what we got.Seeing Kevin Sorbo is a reluctant hero role was nice for a change too. I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Stebbings performance but I don't think the lead female (Nina Dobrev) was written as well as she could've been.A lot of people are calling it a ""rip-off"" of Fright Night. Whatever. I liked it and so I recommend seeing it, especially if you are a Stebbings or Sorbo fan, it's worth the watch."
3,It's okay,"I mostly watched it because I started to like Nina Dobrev from her role in The Vampire Diaries. Unfortunately, it's a little too similar to that (substitute werewolf for Vampire) and unspectacular as compared to that.My advise, just watch the Vampire Diaries instead."
4,Pretty Cool,"A good book (the size of a small table) for anyone who likes the Star Wars movies, or for any Star Wars megafan you know. Contains diagrams and detailed cultural overviews of many of the races and species, explores the mythos and lore of the settings of all films, and is brimming with cut-away maps of every major location from the The Phantom Menace to A New Hope. This is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn all about the greatest sextet in movie history."
4,Great book,"I really like this book. The illustrations are incredibly detailed. I would give it 5 stars if I didn't already own the Star Wars: Complete Locations Episode I, II and Original Trilogy. These are all included in this book. However, it was the only way to get the Episode III locations."
1,Printed upside-down,"My son likes to read the book, and it seems fairly entertaining for someone his age (10). Unfortunately, about 8 pages are bound upside-down and backwards half-way through the book. My son is constantly flipping the book upside-down to read. Amazon could not give me a replacement, because I guess the book became no longer available. Needless to say, very disappointing."
1,Complete Locations? In what galaxy?!,"DK Publishing takes a swing at a great book and MISSES BIG TIME! There is one thing they forgot --- WOMEN STAR WARS FANS BUY BOOKS TOO!!! There is not ONE single diagram of Padme's apartment in the WHOLE book! Despite Ep. 3 has nearly 1/3rd of it's location set there. We don't see the Naboo Palaces, the lake retreat or her family home...it's as if she wasn't even in the movie in this book. Diagramming battlefields, speeder chases and futuristic sports clubs is all well and good but if you're looking for anything on Padme and her surroundings... forget it. This book is a miss. One star is too good for this periodical."
2,You'll either love it or hate it,"I tried hard to give Ms. Adams the benefit of the doubt. I read the reviews here as I was partway through the audio edition (narrated by the author). Sadly, the name-dropping increased as the book progressed.Jazzy-the-dog seems secondary to the story - a prop. I had a tough time buying the fact that he could wreck her important business documents. etc. and she never sent him off to obedience training.For all her name-dropping it seemed rather obvious to me that there was a pattern of her ""friends"" being deposed shahs, dictators, etc. It will be interesting to see how many of those ""celebs"" return her calls the day her column ceases. The Birthday Party episode struck me as garish ( tres Nouveau Riche). The not-so-subtle dissing of her beloved husband's relatives was creepy.In summary, the book certainly gives us a thorough insight into Cindy's character; but not the one she was hoping for!"
1,Not What I Was Expecting,"I was expecting a cute story about Jazzy the Yorkshire Terrier, but this story was all about Cindy Adams, A gossip columnist for the New York Post. She was a good friend of the Shaw of Iran and is a friend to Imelda Marcos...that is a big hint. Not only is her constant name dropping annoying, but her trials and tribulations in adjusting to a new dog are tedious. And, just a side note...what self-respecting breeder would place one of her dogs in a home she has not personally investigated? I don't know Cindy Adams and I've never read her column. Maybe if I cared about her I would have enjoyed this book. But I don't and I didn't."
1,BORING!!!,"I found this book to be BORING & irritating, to say the least!! I can't believe it even got published!! Maybe its her money, ya think?? Its certainly NOT talent. My 15 year old nephew writes better stuff than this! WHO CARES about all these famous people she knows?? Almost none of them have anything to do with the story. Its almost like she mentions them just to make sure she lets you know she knows them! I, for one, could care less! Her dog isn't that funny either. Who cares if he pees on her foot? Maybe he's trying to tell her something!!!!!!!!!"
1,not happy at all,"the bards tale first disk says it is empty....i don't get it. and the free game that was sent......i usually don't complain about the things i get for free, but this did not work either"
1,very disappointing,"The interface is very awkward to use. They should have just used a mouse or keyboard commands. The top down view caused me vertigo and is also awkward. The humor is weak. I don't usually give up on a game, but did for this one."
5,Loved It!!!!,"I've had it a week and cant stop playing it. Wonderful, funny RPG. I look forward to re-playing it to try out what I missed the first time around."
1,Complete waste!,"If you want to throw away money, buy this game. The poor interface and hideous execution make this one of the worst games I've ever tried to play. As for the attempt at humor, forget it. The best thing about this game is the tolerable intro in the booklet that comes with it."
4,This also contains the old Bard's Tale games!,"As a bonus feature on the disk, this game contains the full version of Bard's Tale I through III. I used to play these games back in 1990s. They are three great classic RPGs in their own right. To me, for the price of [...] the classic games alone are worth it."
4,Right Mixture,"""The House of a Thousand Candles"" by Meredith Nicholson was a delightful read. Well-written and quick-paced, the tale had just the right mixture of characters and circumstances, mystery and suspense, romance and skullduggery, to make for an enjoyable read. The only part that stretched credulity was the shootout in the library and why no one was seriously wounded or killed with all those bullets flying around. Other than that and the usual eBook typos (although minimal) and the strange over-usage of exclamation points (the 1909 style of punctuation?), the book was worth the time to read."
5,Excellent Saw,"I was nervous about the power this saw would offer, but I have been very pleasantly surprised. It's obviously not as mobile as gas-powered saws because of the need for an extension cord, but it has gone through everything I've needed it to go through with no problem. It's not especially noisy, and light enough to easily maneuver. Would buy it again in a heartbeat."
1,a piece of junk,"it's hard for me to believe that this thing garnered so many good reviews. i read the reviews and purchased one the other day at lowe's because i had a $10 off coupon. when i took it back two days later for a faulty switch and other electronic problems, the lowe's employee said she wasn't surprised. she said it is rare when one is NOT returned. they have repeatedly asked the company not to stock them anymore but so far the pleas have fallen on deaf ears.i usually don't review a product unless i've purchased it on amazon but since i based my purchase on the feedback here, i had to comment.my husband said, ""it's a total piece of plastic junk""."
1,broke on 3rd use,"I used it two times, and it was good but the third try it was dead (within 2 week period). Sent it back back for replacement from poulan - 2 months still waiting."
5,POULAN ES350 ELECTRIC CHAIN SAW - AWESOME,"I cut down a 25 ft pine tree this past weekend and this 16"" chainsaw worked perfectly ! It had zero problem cutting this 14"" diameter tree. Saw worked better than I had expected. Cut fast, smooth, and without incident. Triming the limbs went smooth as did the cutting of the trunk into 16"" length logs. Probably ran the saw off and on for 1 hour and only used 1 tank of bar & chain oil, which is normal. Once finished cutting, I cleaned the saw up (especially behind the chain sprocket cover) just to do proper maintenance and get rid of the wood chips / sawdust. I re-adjusted / tightened the chain as it did stretch some (which is normal). I could not be happier even only after 1 hour of usage. Owners manual was helpful. I would buy this Poulan ES350 saw again tomorrow. Five stars."
3,Disappointed by lack of Safety Brake,"Disappointed by the lack of Safety Brake... and the lack of shipping box. This unit will run on after you let go the trigger and has NO safety brake like other electrics and gas chain saws I have used. Also they just stuck a label on the retail box which is not a suitable UPS carton on it's own.I sent this back and bought the 18"" Pro version with saftey brake. I like it much better and it cuts well. But it is still shipped in it's store box that is too thin. Better packaging is needed."
3,ok..,the condition of the book was fine and all and the seller was awesome but the actual content of the book was not all it was hyped up to be
1,Be warned...,"I bought another one of the author's titles, from the same publisher, to have something a little smaller to read on the subway rather than pulling out my large textbook. The workable problems and their respective solutions are plagued with errors from beginning to end. I attempted to e-mail and call the author at Johns Hopkins to both bring this to his attention and to attempt to get a corrected solutions set, but to no avail. I feel that posting this is an appropriate warning to students who may actually need to rely on supplemental supplemental material like this to help grasp the material. If his other titles are any indication, I warn you to stay away from this book and seek other material."
5,Textbook/Workbook combo,"This book is amazing because it is a textbook-workbook combo.Most of the time in Orgo, homework is too difficult and tricky (that is, it is too far removed from the basic analysis techniques shown in the readings) to let the student learn while doing the homework.However, this book is organized such that a workbook-like section follows every chapter- and plentiful problems (that are designed to reinforce technique application) of increasing difficulty in application follow each section...but the best part about it- there's space in the book to write and draw!and the paperback is so cheap it's very much worth it to just practice in the book and toss it away later."
1,Really different!,"This non-traditional book on trading methods is based upon geometric techniques (which are always subject to potential scaling errors), numerology, and stock market astrology. Bayer's ellipse method is perhaps the most useful system offered in this book, serving as somewhat as a trailing stop-loss indicator. However, Welles Wilder's parabolic system is more rational and not subject to scaling problems.It should be duly noted that in Mr. Bayer's final market letter to his clients (in 1939), he apologized for making a lot of wrong calls on the market's direction!"
5,Great Callaway Warbird Second Chance Golf Balls,I ordered these balls to give away at a recent golf tournament. They did not look like reconditioned golf balls at all. They were in perfect condition! What a great deal. I will order again.
5,Callaway Warbirds...basically brand new,"I am mostly going to be echoing the other reviewers on these Callaway Warbird Recycled balls. I bought these from Amazon and thought they were reasonably priced (for 3 dozen!) paired with good reviews they received. I do not regret buying these one bit. I am not sure about the other posters but the balls I received were basically brand new, I think only one or two had any sign of use or scuffing at all. They are great, I have played a couple of rounds with them and have only positive words to write. About 2/3 of the balls had company names or logo's on them so there is really no need to mark them, they are unique already. If you are able to, I would recommend buying these and get them from Amazon to take advantage of the free shipping."
5,good golf balls,Other than the business logos I can't tell the difference between these and new golf balls. I'll keep buying these and save my money. Good deal
5,Great Value for Callaway,Great value for what you get. Very pleased with the performance of the balls. Will definitely try again when needed.
3,Gallaway Warbird Recycled golf balls,Over all ball quality is above B grade.I like it. I ordered gallaway but delivered titlelist ball.Any way it is a good ball
4,Golf Ball,"I wish my game was a good as these balls! The price was GREAT I should have pick up two sets, no tax, no shipping, 35 of 36 in near new shape. I have purchased recycled Callaways for more dollars from other venders and not nearly as happy. I will buy these from here again and again!!!"
4,Golf Balls,These balls were not that bad for used Callaway balls at that price. I would probably order more at a later date. I used them in a Golf Tournament last weekend - my team finished 3rd out of 20 teams.
5,Great value,"These are really good balls at a very good price, and since I""m a hacker and lose more of them than I care to admit, buying quality balls at this price is a real treat. The quality of the balls I received was perfect -most if not all appears to be brand new (i.e. not reconditioned or from the bottom of a pond) and now I have lots of logos in my bag to never confuse my ball with any from my playing partners."
4,Surprisingly Good,"This product was the cheapest I could find for a good make of golf balls. Definitely a great value. You can't find Callaways at a better price (on a reputable website). Used balls are great if you dont want to open another sleeve to finish the round, or if you like to take multiple shots from the same location to enhance your skill shots.Some of the golf balls look never used, while some have clearly played a round. They all are clean and playable condition.They were delivered ahead of schedule.Only con - the packaging made it to Massachusetts in 'rough' condition. The packaging held together, but couldn't take much more abuse. That being said, the packaging didn't negatively effect the product in any way."
4,As advertised,"These balls arrived as advertised. Some small scuffs, but that is to be expected when buying recycled balls. So far this seems to be a very good value."
4,"as described, good balls","great packaging and balls are in fairly good condition. I could have bought cheaper balls, but many had poor reviews. these balls were definitely as advertised."
5,impeccable Value,"Due to my higher handicap, along with the copious amount of water around the courses I play it was time I stopped burning a hole in my wallet and switch to a lower grade ball, or go to the other alternative route and switch to a recycled golf ball. I didn't want to sacrifice going to the cheapest ball on the market. I still wanted to play with a quality ball during the hole round, even as water balls. I've bought quite a few of recycled balls in my day. I never bought into the hype of the ""AAAAA"" down to ""A"" rating system. I was hesitant at first to buy these but the price made them WELL worth the while. Out of all the balls, there was only one with a few highlighter marks drawn on them. I opted for the two day shipping and they at my doorstep within a day and 1/2. I look forward to dealing with this company even again within the month!"
3,Recycled Golf Balls,"Haven't played them yet, but was disappointed with the visual quality. More scuffs and marks than I expected based on the description. Have received better quality from other sites."
3,Seven MP doesn't make a great camera,After much research - I bought this camera to take to the Virgin Music Fest in Baltimore - I ended up returning it though - didn't like the zoom at all - the pictures that I used the zoom on looked grainy on my computer so I didn't think they would print much better. I have a pentax optio mx - it's a 3.2 mp and the zoom on it is far superior - I ended up taking it to the music fest and got some great shots and mini movies - don't know that I would have had the same results with this camera
3,Ouch! This collection needs an editor!,"As a 25yr vet of Hollywood, I'm often asked for advice by neophyte writers. I always direct them to two things: William Goldman's ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE, and any and all of his screenplays. The man is a genius at screenwriting, and ADVENTURES is witty, brilliant, and dead-on about Hollywood. True to form, this new book contains nuggets of sheer brilliance and some great entertainment. But the unedited (apparently) collection of articles is repetitive, and begins to read as a rant. How many quotes from addlebrained movie execs does it take for us to realize that they can't have an opinion without hedging? How many times must we hear that Mr. Goldman would like the Oscar voting scores revealed and why? I wish he or an editor had spent the time to shape this book into what Mr. Goldman's terrific ideas warrant. He's a much better writer than the sum of this book. Buy this one to read by the pool, but buy his others to laugh and learn from a master."
2,Recycling day at the Goldman's,"Yes, William Goldman is one of the most renowned screenwriters around but no, these essays have not aged well. If you want to read about handicapping the oscar races from five and six years ago, buy this book. But if you want some real insight into Hollywood, start with any other of the non-fiction books Goldman has written over the years."
3,Great Writer. Book covered a bygone era,I own William Goldman's other books and would buy his additional books. The issue was that this collection of essays come by and large from the 1990s. Things have just changed in the Film Industry so greatly since then. Love his writing and take on things though.
2,Less than expected,"Phone would be awesome if it had better sound quality. It was easy to set up and use and was very practical. However this item has horrible sound quality from the incoming callers and average outgoing sound from the conference side. That's all there really is to say, mostly becasue that's the most import or only quality this item has."
5,Polycon teleconference phone,I bought one used for $85 and it works great. Remote mics really help. Buying one new for $700-800 is really too much.
3,"Ok, but AH isn't the same","It's a battery, what is there to say. It works in my Gateway M275. However the battery size is 3200m AH when the original was 3600m AH."
2,Very good instruments but vocals turned me away,i like the guitar work.... very skilled... very tight and toghter sounding.... the only thing is the vocals are very bad.... cheesy sounding.... needs more meat to it. otherwise i would rate a 5
2,Good information but absolutely terrible video quality,This DVD is very informative and pushes their own products heavily but that's ok since most of us would buy their products anyway.I found the video quality of the DVD to be just horrible. It was very difficult to see details of what the instructors were doing on the scenery.Also the video person spent far too much time panning faces in the audience. I am far more interested in seeing the instruction than faces in the crowd.
4,Trumpets galore!,"Celebrating their 10th anniversary, Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz really made their first decade count. The album has several great songs including a beautiful tribute to their Puerto Rican heritage with ""Bandera."" Even though""La Timba"" starts off with an annoying set of voices that seem like the mind of a delusional person, picks up very well and showcases Bobby Cruz' extremely powerful voice, as well as RIcardo Ray's masterful piano playing. Also worth mentioning is the drum playing on this track which is just fantastic. Overall, the album has some solid songs. On the downside it has swung and missed on a couple of tracks also such as in: ""Le Llaman Jesus"" (lyrically good, music style not so good) and ""Mambo Jazz."" The use of female vocalists on the chorus is kind of skeptical in my opinion, maybe since they are not usually used in salsa. 3.5 stars as I am slightly inclined to like it more than not."
4,Good but not excellent...,"The lens is good, however the zoom can't move (it's fixed) so the zoom are your (my)legs... You have to get a distance of your object to take the shot, cause you can't manage the zoom. The image is good, but in indoor sports with my Sony A200 i just can shot in S Mode, 1/250 (no flash)to get good photos."
4,pimsleur egyptian arabic review,"This is the 3rd Pimsleur language cd set I have purchased. I tried the instant immersion arabic and really did not enjoy it. It was too advanced for my abilities and I could not understand the nuances of what the professor said. The Pimsleur, on the other hand, breaks it down simply and makes it easy for me to understand and imitate. From now on, I will stick with Pimsleur."
2,Like an Introduction to this language is good,"I had a travel to Egypt, and before of my travel I bought this course for learn some words. This course has many vocabulary but most of them are words they not use frequently."
3,The Song everyone is looking for,The song played when the gang is going back to the swamp is CIRCLE BACKWARD. There is also another song called MONSTERS played while they are in there working on the control panel. I think the same group sings both songs.
2,About a Missing Song!,"I've read a couple reviews of people talking about some missing songs. Songs that were in the movie, but not on the soundtrack. I hate when they do this! Anyways, one of you asked what the song was in the movie where Mystery Inc. show up at the clubhouse. It's sort of a slow, sad song. After doing a lengthy search on the internet, I've discovered that the song is called ""Circle Backwards"" by a singer named Mark Provart. I've never heard of him and haven't had too much luck finding a download of a song or someplace to get it. Maybe some of you will have better luck. Anyway, I hope this info helps...I loved the song too!"
1,Missing song,"Hmmm there are couple of songs that are missing from this album. I knew ""The Way"" and the rest and I give this star 1 because there are couple of songs missing out of the album. Dont you guys hate that?!?! UGHHH!!!"

3,it's ok,"i bought this cd because i'm a huge simple plan fan! i basically only like 2 songs on it. #1- ""Don't Wanna Think About You"" by simple plan, and #11- ""Here We Go"" by bowling for soup. it does have a few older songs though, like: ""Love Shack"", and an older song...""The Rockfella Skank"" by fatboy slim (i know it's not that old, but its older than some of the songs on this cd). so, overall, i guess it's worth the money."
4,Another consistant performance by Mr. Afinque,"This is a very solid showing by Willie Rosario in this album. Chamaco Rivera once again is the lead vocal on this album and although I'm not his biggest fan, I still enjoy his performance on Willie's albums. It's always good to here a song about Puerto Rican towns as is the case in the track ""Bayamon"" even better when it describes it perfectly: ""cuando llueve se inunda."" ""En El Monte"" is another reference, but this time of PR's countryside. ""Un Amor Borra Otro Amor"" is a funky love song with great piano arrangements.If you listen to ""Ni Pa'lla Voy a Mirar"" there are some interesting lyrics that are directed to someone particular,who I don't know, but definitely picked up a bad vibe someone threw their way and Alberto Santiago backs him up on the chorus. ""Nicolas"" is the standout track for me. Take out the two boleros and this is a 5 star album. Willie truly deserves his name Mr Afinque."
3,Not mediocre but not great either...,"This 1972 release takes up from where 1971's ""De Donde Nace El Ritmo"" left off. Not as good as Rosario's late 1970s and '80s material but ""En Bayamon"" and ""Nicolas"" are great uptempo dance jams and the cover of Arsenio Rodriguez's ""Un Amor Borra A Otro Amor"" were enough for me to buy this CD."
1,"Cute Webcam, Useless Camera","Nice looking camera, and a handy stand makes it a nice little webcam. However, as a digital camera, it is nearly useless. What is not written in any posted description, in fact, not even on the package, but hidden inside is the notice that if the camerais turned off, batteries removed or run dead, it will erase all pictures within. So, if you take pictures, make sure you have a laptop with you to immediately download your pictures. With this little restriction it is really just a web cam because you mast have a computer with it.There are better webcams for the price, but this cannot even be compared to a portable camera."
1,Unadventures With The Stones,"There's a reason why this book is out of print. The autor is on the road with one of the world's most exciting bands (during their prime)and writes the most boring, un-exciting, whining account of the experience. This is good bedside reading on those nights when you need to get to sleep fast."
3,A fun book,"A great book, it is an older publication being copyrighted in 1959. I like the story line, I like the colorful pictures and the encouragement to use one's imagination."
1,Avoid all Tasco small refractors!,"Tasco small refractors are the epitome of the ""junk department store telescope"". As any ""How to Choose a telescope"" book, website, etc., will tell you, the biggest clue that a scope is junk is that it's advertised on the basis of ""power"". For example, this 'scope is called ""675 power"" - but 60mm refractors are worthless at any power over ~120x! The image just gets extremely dim and muddy. If you're considering buying this 'scope, consider researching the issue a bit more! Binoculars , or a somewhat more expensive scope by Meade or Celestron would be a far wiser investment."
4,Great Buy for the Beginner,"We just purchased this telescope, and I must say that I am very pleased with the telescope, being that I am a beginner. The power of the telescope is much better than the one my husband got me for Christmas (Meade). So far, we have seen Saturn and its rings, Jupiter, and some clusters. We are very satisfied with the quality of the images. Easy to use. Lots of fun. Great for a beginner. Comes with three eyepieces, barlow lens, Software for computer."
3,Brio Crane,"This is a nice little addition, but the crank handle is a little small for the Grandsons to always use, but they enjoy it just the same."
5,Ziska Zings!,"Considered as one of her best fantasies, this fine tale of erotic horrors, transmigration of the soul and reincarnations from ancient Egypt culminates with a breathtaking climax in a secret underground chamber of a pyramid. A wild wonderful ride!"

3,Fun - but forgettable,"Earthworm Jim 3d is by no means a bad game, don't be fooled. It has no real distinctive features, and ultimetely wears a little thin towards the end."
4,Good purchase.,Order was filled properly an product was as represented...I use this product in making wind chimes and it works very well for the purpose intended.
5,Jig How: A Story of the Naval Armed Guard in WWII,"Jig How is the story of a teenage boy growing up in America's heartland in the 1930s. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he joins the Navy and soon finds himself thrust into the middle of some of the fiercest naval battles the world has ever known, including Anzio.Written as a novel, Jig How tells the story of a little-known part of the US Navy, the Naval Armed Guard. At the same time, we see the war through the eyes of one of its members, a typcial American teenage boy, who must grow up and become a man virtually overnight. Attacks by Japanese and German aircraft become almost routine. We are given unique insight into what it was like to be a member of the amazing generation of young men who saved the world from tyranny. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Untamed,"Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward give outstanding performances in this all time classic film. A story of one woman's desire for a man which rules her life from ""rags to riches"" and back again. Lots of great actors in the cast. Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward, Richard Egan, Rita Moreno, and Agnes Moorehead all give their best. A ""must see"" for any fan of any of these actors or classic movies."
2,"Promises, but does not deliver","From the stone walls of Ireland to the plains of South Africa, neither Susan Hayward nor Tyrone Power manage an appropriate accent between them, and thus fail to establish credibility at the outset. The story lacks historical context (the Boers were fighting against the British) and after a complicated series of events, resolves itself into a parody of an American Western.The Cinemascope was fine, but this story could just as easily have been shot in Montana for all the realism it conveyed. Not a shining 112 minutes."
3,Right answers .. wrong book,It doesn't seem to answer the same problems in my textbook. It must be for an older edition. I wonder why Ohanian never gives answers to fundamental problems.
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is Awesome! I love it! Whenever I get the chance I'm listening to it! My favorite song on this CD is ""What Now"". Its about a little orphan girl from china and i really like it because my family is in the process of adopting a little girl from china kinda like Steven Curtis Chapman because he has adopted 3 little girls from china. But i would definetley recommend this CD!"
2,MEDIOCRE!!,"this is the typical contemporary christian music of the 2000s that is sooo middle of the road, elevator music, ordinary...it makes me gag!! i remember in the 80s...music like petra, rez band, leslie phillips, amy grant, randy stonehill, larry norman, all had great melodies and some GUTS to their music...now it's just sooooooo limp wristed and weak! there's NOTHING in this music that motivates or inspires me like the veteran christian music did...sorry...this just doesn't cut it for me!"
4,Very Good!,"Steven Curtis Chapman is one of my favorite Christian artists. His songs are motivating, and fun.All Things New is a song that helps show us how powerful our God is.I Want to Make is possibly the best song on the album. The musical talent of Steven Curtis Chapman really shows in this song.Only Getting Started is just a fun, upbeat, motivating song. It is about how as Christians, we sometimes wear down and feel like we're almost done, but we are really just getting started.The other tracks are awesome as well, I only have time to mention these.""See my other reviews, and please vote me helpfull!""In Christ""MEDIA LOVER"""
4,NOT THE USUAL SCC,"This CD is different from the usual fare from Mr. Chapman in a couple of ways. First, it's more piano driven and acoustic than most of his CDs. Second, the songs are more substantial, both lyric-wise and content-wise. That's actually an improvement in that there's more depth in this CD than in any other he's done. And that's a good thing. Shows he's growing. Of course, the tunes have great ""hooks"", so you will remember. As always, his voice is in fine form, the instrumentation is excellent, and the production is stellar. Verdict: Better than ""All About Love"" and ""Declaration,"" and ""Speechless"" was better. Buy it? Oh, yes!"
2,No thanks,"I got this album for Christmas, and I must say I'm disappointed. It sounds much different from his earlier stuff, with a different-sounding of guitar, and a rather electronic sound through the whole album.The songs:In ""All Things New"", Steve's voice sounds like a poor imitation of Christine Dente/Out of the Grey.""Big Story"" reminds me of Christine's ""Bigger Story"", and ""Please Only You"" is somewhat like Out of the Grey's ""Better Way To Fall."" And besides that, they are just plain bad, nothing like Steven's other songs.""Coming Attractions"" instantly brought to my mind Tobymac's song ""What's Goin' Down"" off his album ""Momentum."" Sounds just like it.The other songs I don't care for much either, with three exceptions: ""Much of You"", ""Treasure Of Jesus"", and ""Angels Wish.""Steven Curtis Chapman is my favorite artist, but on this album, he bombed."
1,BUYERS WARNING and I love it,"I have now owned 3 dual strikes the thumb pad is *very* poorlycrafted. The store I bought it from offered a replacement guaranteefor 4.00 so I bought it, and I'm glad Ill be getting my fourth dual strike today. Why you say because is an incredible tool...If it wasn't for the thumb pad I'd throw my mouse, keyboard and joystick out the window. Its a dream pad...If Microsoft can beef up the thumb pad they have a serious winner. If not, Ill just keep exchanging them for a year then get my money back!Thumb pad breaks off way to easily...with maybe 10 hours of game play consistently Don't buy one without a purchase extended warranty. In fact don't buy one unless you have lots of free time to keep exchanging it. END"
2,Good While It Lasted....,"I agree with all of the reviews up until now. The product was GREAT for playing games like Quake 2 and other shoot 'em ups. But, the fun only lasted until the thumb directional pad fell off. After looking at how it happened, it's easy to see that it (the thumb pad) was definitely under-engineered. It's only held on by a small piece of plastic (approx. 1/8"" in diameter), and it is easily broken during normal gameplay.I got more than 10 hours of use, but it definitely didn't last as long as I expected from a product from Microsoft. I have purchased other Microsoft hardware, and I'm very happy with the durability of those, just not the Dual Strike."
2,EXPECTED BETTER FROM MICROSOFT,"This Controller has to be by far, the WORST by Microsoft. Within 5 days, the swivelling Point of View hat had broken off, which didn't really bother me as I couldn't get the controller to work with half of my games! If you want to try it, it isn't a bad price if you like throwing your money. My advice: STAY AWAY! FAR, FAR, AWAY!"
2,the directional pad is cheap!!!,"Within 2 months of buying this controller it broke. although, the thing rocked for Soldier of Fortune. Upon further examination of the boken piece, I realized just how cheaply it had been put together. it seemed bound to break. Otherwise, the game software could come with a lot more configuration shemes. Or, at least have them for download someplace."
5,The Right Controller for the right game...,"For those of you who remember a similar tilt axis namco controller for the playstation will already know that this controller was made for, Racing games. The one I bought it for was Episode 1 PODRACER, just sit back and play with an almost uncanny similarity to the actual game vehicle. Sure it takes getting used to but it is definately worth the time. It's not going to replace the keyboard and mouse for games like Quake and Unreal but I have yet to find a controller that does.The controller is great for freeing yourself from your desk to the comfort of your couch with one device to control. I have successfully configured the game to play for games like Soul Reaver, Slave Zero and Star Seige.-=j=-"
1,WTF IS THIS THIS THING???!!!,"This item appears to be a PC Controller of some type. However, I can't imagine how I could control any game accurately with it. Just look at the stock photo. WTF is this thing?!"
1,Obsolete GameController - don't buy it,"Having purchased a new VISTA PC, I thought I'd try the new game demo LOST PLANET. Remarkable graphics for a first person shooter game, so I tried this game controller to navigate. Ugh. It was designed for win98, and isn't supported by MS. No recent drivers, and you can't easily turn right/left, or look-shoot up or down. Modern games do lots more than this old junk can handle."
2,Does not tolerate Cold,"I bought this for a temperate area of Florida. It arrived OK, and seemed to do well until winter rolled around. We had a 34* night and it died immediately. So beware of planting this in any area where temperature go to 34*."
5,sweet ride,"I just got back from my Super Fat Cat's maiden voyage, and wow...what a nice floater. I looked at a few imitations - the Trout Unlimitet Togiak, and Outcast's el-cheapo version, the Fish Cat - there's no comparison. The SFC is definitely spendy, but if you can swing it, it's worth every penny.You ride nice n high with your butt completely out of the water, which is great for comfort, visibility, and casting. You can get the thing going at least twice as fast as a regular floater, because you're not dragging yourself through the water, and the v-shaped design cuts drag too. Handles great, is nice n stable, and is obviously well-made. There's plenty of space for gear in the side pockets, and in the bow there's tons of room for more stuff...like a cooler :-).Best gear purchase I've made in a while. Get it. You won't regret it."
3,"Very obvious translation from Italian, tendentious","I read this history having some background; while he does cover the facts, the battles and dates and so on, he has what I'd characterize as a disdain for non-European culture, and while the glory of the caliphate was in the 7-11th century, he sort of quickly closes out the recent history without much depth or understanding."
3,Nothing like the original group with their roots music-70's.,"After waiting so long, I was expecting much more roots type music with the cool tones they are known for. Where did all the experience from the 60's & 70's go? The rhythms are less than Abyssinians style. Sorry, I grew up on this music and this one is not up to par."
1,Is this a mono recording?,"This recording sounds mono, not stereo. It reminds me of attending a live symphony while sitting in the top tier of a very large concert hall."
5,A must-have!,"This is a great book. It very nicely documents the rise of the hamburger and White Castle in 1920's America. Hogan follows White Castle through the early times, when a man could work there and make enough to support a family, through the depression, the rough war years, and more recent competition with the fast food giants. I'm not sure why he waited until the last two pages to tell readers what makes White Castle special and has enabled it to persist for so long....but this is a minor complaint. Excellent!"
4,THE NEXT BEST THING TO EATING 'EM!,"Okay, so here's my bias: I grew up eating White Castle Hamburgers, and have been deprived of them ever since I moved out west. So this book was truly the next best thing to eating 'em! Now having said that, this book is nevertheless a fun and informative read; and a pop culture history that will bring a smile to your face. The writing is at times a tad clunky, and the later chapters not as detailed as one would like. The premise of the book--that American culture was shaped in part by the White Castle Hamburger--gets a bit lost. But the premise itself is strong enough to make the overall work a winner. Strongly recommended to burger lovers everywhere!"
3,One of those Cookbooks that you read rather than cook from!,"This book was voted most popular cookbook in UK recently, but the panel of judges were food writers and professional cooks. Beautifully illustrated with watercolor and line drawings, and an enjoyable read with witty anecdotes. However, it is more a cookbook that you spend a Sunday afternoon reading and then put on the shelf and never cook from. So if you are thinking that this is actually useful to have around the house and cook from, beware - the recipes are a little fancy for a busy working woman (let alone mum with kids)!"
4,Not a novel,"I read an article about this book and thought it was a novel; only when I ordered and received did I realize it was cookbook ( I am kinda slow ); however, wonderful and all encompassing cookbook which covers a tremendous range of foods with easily understood instructions; who would have thought what a cup of red wine vinegar would do to a stewing chicknen!"
2,"Somewhat amusing as a set of essays, not so much as a set of recipes","Do any of you recall what M.F.K. Fisher said about a certain kinds of writing about food? Refer to the first chapter of her 1937 'Serve It Forth'; included in the compilation 'The Art of Eating'. Mr. Hopkins' work manages to totter and crumple amongst his experiences and preferences, sometimes evoking appreciation or a chuckle. The recipes are not bad, merely not that necessary if you are an experienced cook. Newish or learning cooks will be better served by purchasing the two volume ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" by Julie Child, a pre-1980's edition of Joy of Cooking, and one of Mark Bittman's 'How to Cook Everything' books. If you want to give a novice cook some food history and appreciation, with recipes, Raymond Sokolov's 'The Cooks Canon' is a better choice."
4,Useful and Thoughtful,"I truly enjoy this cookbook. It has recipes that are very handy, and that have become staples in my household. The directions are clear, which is very important for me as a somewhat novice cook. I have also enjoyed just sitting and reading from it, without directly using it as a resource. The writing is engaging and thoughtful."
4,Editing Makes a Difference,"I love to cook and try new things. I've learned Indian cooking through cookbooks...good thing. Although I love the layout and concept of the book...if I didn't know better there would have been no onions in my curry! ""Mrs. Pringle's Kofta Curry"" is delicious. However, there are no instructions about adding back those deliciously browned onions and garlic to the pan. Editing is everything in cookbooks. Careful please!"
3,It's still a cookbook,"I enjoyed the writing style of the vignettes and the cookbook itself, but it still is mostly a cookbook. The stories element is not really there, it's more like anectdotes realted to the recepies. As a cookbook it is friendly and fun. As a book with stories... Not so much."
4,great book!,"I purchased this second hand book and when it arrived I was delighted to discover it was in pristine condition ""as good as new""."
4,light and entertainting for light entertaining,"This is a refreshing interesting book full of inspiration for those times when you are saying ""what can I make tonight"" excellent choice."
1,too much fat!,"I was very disappointed in this cookbook. I liked the idea of a cookbook with a few recipes for each ingrediant, but these recipes are almost all made with tons of butter, cream etc. I already know how to make anything delicious with those ingrediants!"
1,Poorly made logo should not be sold,The edges of this magnet furl up like a fried oyster and thus provide poor adhesion to the metal surface. It would help if it were bordered by a black or white trim.
2,Doesn't stay on the car.,"Shipping and arrival of this was great. However, I cleaned the side of my wife's car, it doesn't fit on the back, and put it on. At some point in the first 3 miles of driving, locally, the magnet flew off and was lost within 5 hours of my wife opening it as a Christmas gift. I would not recommend this unless you are putting it on the rear of your vehicle or not on a car."
1,worst online purchase ever!!,"I bought 2 of this item from these guys for my kids laptops. One of them came defective and I reqested a full refund for both beacuse they said that according to Amazon policy I had to pay shipping cost for returned items. It has been almost a month sending emails back and forth and I still haven't seen my refund back yet. Needless to say, my kids are still unable to use their laptops and I am extremely unhappy with these guys. I will NEVER buy from them again."
2,lasted seven months,"got this ac adapter in Dec 2007 and at some point in the past 8 months, i slapped quite a bit of electrical tape over the parts that bend the most on the cord as the jacket of the cord was pulling back from the individual wires. last month it started working intermittently and now its dead completely (aug 2008). Poorly constructed."
3,"Works fine, but a little weird","The cord on this that links to the power outlet isn't the greatest thing in the, world, but I was able to use my old cord with no problem. The strange thing though, is that the power source creates some serious interference with my radio. Whenever it is plugged in, whether the computer is attached or not, my radio gets a ton of static. Other than that it seems fine though."
4,What a trip!,"What a great read! Written as a series of short tales, it reminded me of sitting with my buddies swapping stories on any given night. The stories are a great mix of the ribald, the hilarious, and also serious. This is a book that can be read again and again."
5,Funniest Cop Stories I Have Ever Read,"Growing up in NYC usually is synonomous with being a veteran subway rider..there is actually no other way to get around the 5 boroughs without them. I found this book to be extremely funny and it was amazing to see the subways from an ""insider's"" view! Having grown up around alot of NYC cops, I have always loved hearing their stories, and I guess most people feel that way from the success of police stories like ""Cops"" and ""NYPD Blue"". Unlike the above mentioned, Trebor Nehoc's stories are so funny that you will find yourself laughing out loud! Not too many books can make me do that! I think everyone who has ever ridden a subway should read this book, you may even see yourself or someone you know in some of the stories.....can't wait for a sequel!!!!"
4,Got Love Tractor?,"Wow, amazed to hear a new release from Love Tractor!I just happened to be looking on amazon.com and I wanted to see if there were any re-issues of early Love Tractor stuff on CD. And I saw that a new CD was coming out in a week! Talk about timing! Well it's out now!The new CD is fantastic. I just got it today. laid back, spacey, mellow but quirky, with energy, catchy. I love it. Fans don't be scared! Welcome Love Tractor back!"
3,"ugly cover, sweet music","the first thing i thought when i saw this cd was ""oh...wow, this is the band who did that Themes From Venus album a long time ago...cool."" the second thing i thought was ""i have never seen an album cover with worse layout and graphic design. it would have been difficult to make this look any uglier!"" but this is a pretty cool cd, not as embraceable as their past work, but full of some sweet gems like ""Christ Among The Children"" and ""Palace Of Illusion."" Love Tractor's jangly pop sounds just as relevant as it did in their heydey, but the heavy presence of keyboards gives The Sky At Night a less urgent and heartfelt tone...resulting in a lack of sparkle in some of these songs... but overall, not bad."
5,It dose not get better than Henry Miller,"You can not call yourself a reader if you have not read Henry Miller.He is one of the best writers of all times and reading his work will change the way you think of books as an art form.On the next cold wet rainy day you have, stay home and read ""Tropic of Capricorn"" its an exploration a voyage into a higher realm of truth telling.K.LaRon"
2,Uninspiring,This book was recommended to me but it did not satisfy my interest so far that I even don't remeber what it was all about. :(
4,Safe sleeping,"I can now sleep at ease knowing that when my son rolls into his bumper and sleeps, that he is able to breath. I purchased this breathable bumper because once my son was able to roll over at 4 months, I found him sleeping against his bumper that came with the crib. I would wake up every half an hour to go move him away from it because it had no breathable holes and I was so afraid he would suffocate. With this bumper and the breathable holes, I let him sleep up against it all night and he actually sleeps better without me moving him around now.The only bad thing is, he likes to pull it up and down because it is east to move and he sometimes likes to put his limbs out of the crib. Rare occasion does he do that though!This is my best purchase for safe sleeping."
2,Annoyances,"The most annoying thing about these cds is the intrusive and unnecessary intros to the poems which most listeners will not care to listen to more than once. The second most annoying thing about these cds is the intrusive, unnecessary and unattractive trumpet at the beginning or ends of many poems. The third most annoying thing about these cds is the poor reading, which at times doesn't follow either prosody or normal voice in its pitch patterns and emphasis. Apart from these three annoyances, these are fair cds. They might be useful in educational settings, where the intros might be appropriate and the trumpet might keep students awake. I gave this two stars rather than one because the poetry presented is immortal."
4,Great introduction to John Donne,"This set of tapes is a good way to begin a study of John Donne, or if already a fan, to be cradled by his words read aloud by melliflous English voices. There is a good biographical sketch interlaced with some of Donne's most famous works, giving the listener the historical background and influences behind some of the world's best poetry."
3,difficult,"This book (which i did not finish to read) lists a number of flaws you should avoid when you try to convert a thesis into a fair readable book, and that is what I am trying to do.But it is a little wordy and wooly, and a bit too theoretical.However, it can be useful, in my opinion, chiefly for literary workshops."
1,THE NANO IS DEAD!!!,"Here's the deal... Bought this thing a month ago, unpacked it, put a tissue in it and put it underwater overnight, woke up to find a completely dry tissue after being submerged for 8 hours. So, I have been using it for about a month with my iPod Nano. Swimming laps, rockin' out, makes lap swimming fly by.Then this morning I got in the pool at 5:30, put on my headphones and began to swim... by 5:32 my Nano was DEAD. I stopped and looked only to see my screen flashing, the case fill with water and my iPod die before my eyes (how dramatic). After looking at the case, everything looked normal! I am at a loss as to how water got into the thing, and the T seal was IN PLACE!Anyway, I don't recommend this thing at all! Very disappointing! The only good thing about this is that it fried my little nano and not my huge 60 GB model that houses my entire music collection."
1,Very disappointed,"My H2O waterproof housing failed & flooded out after only 5 uses -- obviously ruining a $250 8GB Nano G2. I think the gasket (that comes off and/or moves out of place VERY easily) shifted as I closed the case allowing water by. The Otter box I had was a little larger, but it wouldn't close unless everything was properly in place -- I should have gone with what worked instead of what supposedly worked better (they advertise 3M depth versus 1M for the Otter box). By the way -- they don't cover your iPod in their warranty, which should tell you something.Use the H2O headset, but stay away from this ""waterproof"" housing!!!"
4,Works. But a bit bulky,"This case works as it claims, I've swum 25 miles with it over the last couple of months. The case is bulky, and there's no way to lock the scroll wheel, which is a nuisance. But it works, and that sure makes my 30 minutes in the Endless Pool a lot less boring! The first few times, opening the case is really hard. But it seems to get easier. And the H2O Audio headphones are a dud for me, but work fine for me wife. There are lots of ways to keep your iPod dry, but this seems about as solid as any."
3,An enjoyable read.,"I thought that this book was quite well done. I liked all the pictures and the text was allright. Though I will not rant and rave about this book being the best, (if you want reaaly good, go read I, Jedi), I thought it was a very good effort. Some of the pictures were silly and almost useless, but some like the Drall and the Selonians were interesting to see. I also finally learned what Lando does in Tanaab. It's worth bying."
3,A Good Start -Needs An Update,"This book can be helpful to hard core fans, but it is woefully incomplete and I was not impressed with the tiny artwork. One reviewer here hit it spot on when they said that this book should have focused more on what the planets were like (climate, ecology, civilizations,cultures, mini-history) rather than rehashing the stories from those worlds. It would have been nice if they had explained the meaning of ""Agriworlds"" And ""Industrial Worlds"" and their roles in the SW Galaxy. It would have been nice if they'd done the obvious and updated the book to include the Prequel worlds too. And while they were at it, some of the more intrieguing worlds from the obscure corners of the universe like Togoria, Renastasia, Dellallt, Grizmallt,Taris, Or Malachor V.(Heck- since they could included Rafa IV, they could have included some of these) Of corse if they expanded this in the way I'd like to see, it would be a huge richly illustrated tome indeed. But I'd buy it."
4,Awesome but not so awesome,This book is good but it doesn't say enough about the planets. Most of it is about their involvement in Star Wars
2,outdated and unnecessary,"Published in 1998, this book doesn't include any of the prequel information or planets. It does, however, have some extended universe stuff. Also, most of the ""see also"" books listed in the front are out of print now. This book is nothing but a summary of events and where they take place--you won't find anything new or interesting here."
2,Dosen't give much information.,"The information on websites such as Wookiepedia is much better. It dosn't go in depth, and right now is quite outdated. I was expected maps of the galaxy and planets, but there were none, just a very small section of the planet. I would wait until the Star Wars Atlas (Which I'm extremely excited for) comes out."
3,"great musicians, mediocre material",All jazzers know these cats are great. Let's talk the tunes: You got 35 min. of music and 13 of those minutes are irritating. I've had this disc for a good while and have given the CD many chances to grow on me. I give up. You can hear these guys do better on most other records. I am a jazz drummer (for decades) and can tell you that Pete's soloing is pretty unimpressive on on this disc. The bottom line is: The twenty minutes of palatable music is not worth the cost of the CD. I like Gilmore's distinctive playing. Just wish there were a better selection of tunes on here.
4,Bliss!,"I have had this album for over 17 years. While recently listening to it I realized that this must be a Pete Laroca date. I have it under Chick Corea's name entitled, ""Bliss"". It was given to me by a jazz fan, friend who counldn't stand the drumming of Pete Laroca. I took it and though initially it was kind of srange sounding I have come to cherish it very much. The recording allows the drums to be too prominent, but I very much like the feel. I recommend it for anyone who likes exotic pieces. The recording makes it four stars, otherwise a must for those with eclectic tastes."
2,Ok but buggy,"The gameplay is ok, but a couple of issues really hurt the game. For example (as others have mentioned), if you save a game more often than not when you reload the game it is in a default ballpark. It may seem like a minor thing, but it gives you an idea of the kind of obvious flaws that were released with the game. Also the baserunning controls are sluggish at best. Overall pretty dissapointing."
1,Its not MVP baseball,"This was my first year purchasing the MLB 2k series. I am hugely disapointed with my purchase. Yes the graphics are better, Yes the computer A.I. is smarter, and yes I love the new trading block system. But this game is one of the least user friendly games I have ever played.In order to save while in franchise mode you must save your profile, franchise settings(if modified), Lineup, and season. It takes forever. It extremely difficult to create a player and add him to your team. As for the game mode: there no radar gun for pitchers so you have no idea how hard your pitcher is throwing. The fielding controls are a joke. The batting is the one aspect that's not bad, but once you reach base its a pain in the but to steal a base. Everytime I tried the runner left to early and was picked off by the pitcher. I have always played the EA sports MVP series and this is a huge downgrade from that series. I'm 24 years old and feel like a [...]trying to figure out the controls for this game."
2,Lousy pitching interface...,"I rented this game before buying and I'm glad I did! Graphically nice, but as another reviewer said, ""Often the commentary does not match the gameplay"". Also, I found the pitching interface to be confusing. Maybe I am just stupid, but I did not enjoy this game at all. The opposing batters hit almost everything I threw at them, and there were many in the park homeruns. Pathetic. The EA MVP series was much, much, better and I am sorry to see 2K take over the fanchise. I haven't played the Xbox360 version, but I am not prepared to pay that much for a ""game"" machine."
4,2k7 - fun and frustrating,"The game is a lot of fun, the graphics are great, once you get use to the game play it is a good time. However; the computer makes too many unbelievable catches. The computer will climb the wall and steal away homeruns, or it will have it's players layout for amazing diving catches, the kind that you'd see only once in an entire season from your hall of famers, not every other inning. And the base running should be a little more intuitive, if you accidently hit the run button, the computer should retract the players rather than let them run into a base accidently for an out."
3,the game has a few bugging traits.,"This game is an improvement from last year, but be warned of a few very anoying details... The cpu is a perfect fielder. And yes, in this game there is a defense against homeruns. Every homerun hit is catchable if you jump the wall, which is very hard to do with the right timing. The cpu catches the homeruns almost everytime.Most of the games in the rookie setting, i win 1-0. In the pro setting, I lose like 8-1 alot.Very few ground balls make it through the infield because the cpu can dive for it and still throw you out by a couple yards.Even with all those problems this game is still fun. Payoff pitches and easy diving make it fun.Enter the cheat code Derek Jeter to unlock evrything!"
4,"solid game, awesome graphics","MLB 2K7 for Xbox is solid.the graphics are awesome! you really see the true Atlanta Braves colors in this game.the gameplay is easy and smooth and the rosters are easier to mess with because you only have the MLB and Triple A rosters to play with.in MVP 2005, which i still play, you make one roster move, and then you've got to make 10 more just to fit the bill.Pros-custom music, including batter intro music-awesome detailed graphics-rich in colors and design-different weather modes, cold, cloudy, afternoon-easy and smooth gameplay-commentary from ESPN-old school pitching and hitting modesCons-sometimes, the game can seem to computerized and at times, it seems slow-pitching is slow-although graphics are awesome, MVP had better face and player graphicscompare the 2, and you'll know what i mean.overall, solid game. lots of fun. More for hardcore baseball gamers."
5,Perfect Condition,Better than expected. Book was in perfect condition and we are already using it for Sunday dinner.Not only would I recommend to a friend but others in our family are ordering the book.Thank you!
4,A book of poems by one of the best of Internet poets.,A beautifully produced highly intelligent book of poems from probably the best poet on the Internet. I would pick out the first and the fourth sections.The first section is the `Stony Run' sequence which in tremendous poetry describes the author's Oregon surroundings. The fourth section is purported to be a verse letter by Petrarch. This is all highly intelligent work and is to be recommended.
2,Defective software,"The ""convenient"" install went OK. After it was installed, I immediately registered the product on-line and downloaded the latest update (both content and an apparent bug-patch).Nevertheless, this piece of software seems to have a memory leak, and typically uses 320 Megabytes of system memory EVEN AFTER I QUIT THE APPLICATION. This requires me to re-boot my computer to regain usage of HALF OF MY SYSTEM MEMORY. This is inconvenient, and utterly ridiculous for modern software.Unless you enjoy re-booting your computer everytime you use the Britannica, I advise you to NOT buy this software. This saddens me, because I like the textual content. The multi-media element,however, leaves much to be desired.System details:- Macintosh 867 G4- 640 MB RAM- OS X 10.1.4"
2,A software dud,"Britannica is the best encyclopedia in print. Why, oh why, can't they get the software right? Examples: The video clips are stock footage of no instructional purpose, some are simply of animals grazing (dumb!), the audio clips are few and far between, as are the video clips. This is multimedia circa 1985! Not 2002! The clipboard function explanation was confusing. The navigator was slow and only touched upon articles directly related to the topic. What happened to a macropedia?I was disappointed by this. Maybe they will get it right in a few years. As it is, it is a very unimpressive cd-rom and will put you to sleep."
1,Where?!?!,"I've been anxiously awaiting this product for over two months now, and each time the release date hits, we're then told to wait longer. I'm sure it's because Macmillan is either updating its information, still working out bugs (the PC version was apparently pretty buggy) or Carbonizing for use with OSX. Whatever the case, the company's Web site is hush-hush, and those of us still waiting are starting to get a bit too restless. Let's see how long that sales rank in the upper 500s lasts before we all get fed up."
1,Purfect Prank,"I bought a copy of this book for myself and a copy for a friend. I'm not going to give the copy to my friend and I don't really know what to do with the one I have. It's not because I'm offended at the idea of people painting cats. I just feel ripped off. I bought the book because it was quirky and pretty. While the pictures are still lovely, apparently they're all done in photoshop. There is no disclaimer on the book anywhere, and while I'm sort of glad that people aren't really painting cats, I can mock up pictures of painted cats in photoshop all on my own. This book isn't an oddity of human nature, it's a fraud that doesn't have the decency to let you know that. You have to first buy it and then figure it out for yourself. I want my money back."
1,There should be a warning on this book.,"like a fool i was taken in by this hoax of a book and tried to paint my cat, Mr. Pie. needless to say he did NOT go for it. the peroxide burned his eyes and he scratched the hell out of my arms. i don't recommend trying to paint your cat. just buy this book and enjoy the photos instead. what was i thinking? paint + cats = disaster."
1,Only losers paint cats,Buy this book and share with all your friends- the cat painted as a showgirl got a great laugh here at work.
1,Not so funny now,"I didn't realize that this book was a big lie. I found it interesting until I began to look up each ""artist"" on the internet wanting more information about their ""art."" Hmmmmm, not one person is to be found anywhere painting anything. I no longer think the book interesting or funny, I just feel ripped off and mocked for my interest."
1,Too much time on their hands,"Why give wackos any more ideas whether real or not? Sorry, Amazon,bad idea!"
1,Lame excuse for a book....wasted paper....,"I looked through that book lastnight..., and only becasue my fiance was begging me to. Needles to say, I was unimpressed with the way the book trys to fool its readers into actually thinking people paint their cats like this. The image quality is horrible, and their poor job of ""painting"" the cats only had me fooled for about half of a second. No where in the book(that I could find) does it state that these pictures have been touched up. I did not look long for words stating this, as i was so disgusted at the poor ""photo-chopping"" they did..."
5,Better than Why Cats Paint - by a whisker.,"Why Paint Cats is quite simply wonderful! That these compliant felines will submit to such body art, and strut it, speaks volumes for their egocentricity - and Silver and Busch's mastery. The applications are fabulous and suprising. So be prepared to challenge your whole concept of what is acceptable in cat appearance."
3,Cute but expected more,"I love the Why Paint Cats calendar and so does my mom. I purchased this book for her when I couldnt find a ""Why Paint Cats 2007"" calendar. The pictures are beautiful and the history of the painted cat entertaining but what was most disappointing was the size of the book. It was smaller than your average CD case and yes, I purchased the hardback. Overall, I dont think the book is worth the price, but I would have gladly paid more for a calendar than this book."
1,Also too small!,"I did not notice these were miniature books only 4"" by 4"", you can't see any of the paintings they are too small."
5,Imaginative Yet So Not So,"Photos distributed on the web raised my eyebrows, first at the thought that people would do this to their cats, and then at the growing sense that the photos were doctored. Even so, they are a trip. I am certain that someone somewhere has been inspired to paint or bleach their cats, and one only hopes the cats come out of it all relatively unscathed. Well done."
1,Photoshopped Cats!,"I haven't read this book, merely flipped thru its pages, and while its full of witticisms and dumb observations.. I just can't get over the fact that people think these cats are really painted. They're not. Look real hard, it's photoshop magic. Why bother buying it? I suggest borrowing it if possible."
1,Authors need to make a statement here,"I think with all the confusion here it is hard to give a proper review- maybe some stars for a spoof but should there be any if a lack of a responsible disclaimer is endangering the very cats that the lover's of this book profess to also love?Please Burton Silver, Heather Busch if you are out there- set the record straight for those who might paint a cat!"
1,PLEASE DON'T PAINT YOUR CAT,"I thought Silver's previous book, Why Cats Paint, was hilarious. This book I thought was funny, too - until I saw my first painted cat today. It never occurred to me that people might actually take this stuff seriously and try to imitate it. PEOPLE - IT'S A SPOOF. The cat I saw had paint all over the inside of his mouth and a badly ulcerated tongue. We couldn't get the paint off his coat by any means other than clipping the fur.Enjoy the book. BUT PLEASE - DO NOT PAINT YOUR CAT!"
1,Surprise Surprise,"I bought this book at a fair price in comparison to others at Amazon. It arrived in a tiny envelope....it was a miniature book. No where in the sellers ad did it say it was a mini book. I wrote the seller, and got the standard response, that I can send it back for a refund. If it were advertised correctly, none of this would have happened. Beware!"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"For the hardcover edition if one reads the full description you can see way down on the details for the dimensions that the book is a miniature book, but I think most people look and see the Hardcover edition is cheaper than the Softcover edition and go no further. I think it would be good of Amazon to note on the edition choices that the Hardcover is a miniature copy. The book is fun but the miniature edition takes away from the humor that comes from looking at the photos."
4,Great learning of stopping and going.,My son loved this especially that he is learning the concept of stopping and going. Makes his track set up more interesting now.
2,Too complicated to play!!!,"Very hard to play , sixaxis mode doesn't work very well, very hard to run with man on bases. No recomended for baseball players beginers."
2,Buy MLB 07 The Show Instead,"If you've been playing MLB 06: The Show then do not buy this game. I can already guarantee it will be a better game then this. The controls for this game are awkward to say the least. You use the motion sensing to swing the bat which might sound cool but it's really not. Moving a controller forward to swing a bat isn't cool at all. It's like the people from 2k thought they were making this for the Wii. Also compared to other PS3 games the graphics on this aren't very good. There are aliasing problems all over this version. $60 is a lot to pay for a video game and when it turns out the way this one does you will have a case of buyer's remorse. It won't be that long until MLB 07 comes out (April 16, I believe) so just keep playing 06 for a little longer."
4,A great collection to my library.,I need a book on what if. It helps those on both sides. The information for the most part was great to gather more information off of.
2,"""How To"" get visitation in court when barred by mom/dad","The author presents the basic legal process on obtaining visitation rights via petitioning the circuit court in your state. The steps here are only for those who cannot negotiate reasonable visitation directly with the custodial parent. The book includes brief suggestions on hiring an attorney. The book is fairly dry and basic, with little commentary. An alternative would be to purchase a how-to divorce guide an apply the process to a grandparent motion; you may receive more in-depth information from a ""how to"" divorce guide on the court process than from this book."
3,Legal Forms,"Turns out I won't be needing these forms afterall, but someone else may find them helpful."
5,She's The Best,"I was afraid I would be disappointed because I expect so much of her, based on her past and present cartoons. I love this book, and it never gets old. Turn to any page when you need a good laugh. My dream is to have lunch with Roz Chast and Jon Stewart. My idea of Beautiful people."
5,Absolutely Hilarious -- I've Given This to Everyone I Know,"Ms. Chast should be able to retire now based on the amount of money I've spent just buying copies of this wonderfully witty book. It's good, clean humor that anyone would love. In fact, one of my friends has permanently borrowed MY copy . . ."
4,Keeps on shreding,We've shredded dumpsters full of paper.The paper full detector seems to go on sooner than necessary. We've stopped using plastic bags which seem to make the detector go on too soon.Oil regularly!
5,A homage to my admired Professor Raul Hilber,"With great interest I have red the ""The Warsaw Diary of Adam Czerniakow"". It is very moving and an example of outmost dignity in such catastrophical situations.I was touched by the serenity of Professor Raul Hilberg explaining the personality of Adam Zcerniakow in the film ""SHOA"".He has not deceived me...! By the way, now thatthe Israelis are building Walls... should they not read this terrible Testimony? I recommend then to do"
5,Camp Survivor,"Camp survivor are really books that Interest me. I cannot believe these poor people had to suffer so much just because they were Jews. Hitler was a killer from hell. May his soul, if he had one, burn in hell."
5,Attention Nanci Fans...,"I find it rather disturbing that there are so many of you who claim to be 'fans' who would so quickly turn a cold shoulder to the flyer with her recently released 'best of' album. Consider it a preface to her new album ""Clock without Hands"" due out in July. A true fan is one who knows to pass over the 'best of' albums as they already own the songs and allow newby's the chance to introduce themselves to her music in such a manner. I personally do not own this album because I have each of these songs on other albums, however, I am smart enough to have turned it over and read the titles before purchase. If you don't like it, don't buy it, wait for the new album. Don't slam a woman who works so hard to bring entertainment to our lives, keep it to yourself and move on with your life. Grow up."
3,"The more I listen, the more I like it...","Nanci Griffith's girlish voice and sometimes quirky delivery used to drive me nuts, but she is such an intricate songwriter that it's hard not to be won over eventually. I bought this CD a couple of months ago, and enjoy it quite a bit. ""Trouble In The Fields"" is my favorite Griffith song; it's so perfect. I had never heard ""Late Night Grande Hotel"" before I bought this disc; while many of her songs reflect on sadder themes (""And here you were thinking that you thought you knew me well/But no one ever knows the heart of anyone else/I feel like Garbo in this late night grande hotel/'Cause living alone is all I've ever done well.""), it's almost impossible not to listen."
1,I guess you've made it when all you do is reissue old stuff,For a creative artist like Nanci Griffith to release an album of old stuff like this is disappointing. There's already a cheap-o greatest hits CD and a retrospective CD out on MCA with almost all these songs on it.There's nothing wrong with any of these songs; they're the songs that made many people fans of Nanci Griffith. Those people are still waiting for a Nanci Griffith album. Disappointing.
3,A wonderfull book more about life then building,A wonderfull book more about life then building. I found as a builder it raing a bell. It took poetry and the process of autobiograpy and nailed it on to a rafter for us to find as we take apart his life by building his house.
3,Not what I was looking for,"I think this is a good book, but it's not what I was looking for. It's sort of a little adventure story of one man's experience building a house. If you're looking for a book that covers the human travails of building a house, you'll probably love it. However, if you're looking for something that goes into some of the technical aspects of contracting and building your own house, you'll probably be disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money - a piece of junk,"I bought this for my 3-year old great-granddaughter. I feel ripped off. It was awkward to put together, but we did accomplish that. The biggest thing is that the wheels don't work right. The front wheels won't swivel, every time the cart is pushed a bit the wheels turn sideways. So, on our first shopping venture with it, she couldn't steer it and it was hard to push because the front wheels turned sideways. I put a few things in the front figuring that with a little weight and traction they would work better. That didn't work. I turned them straight often, but they still turned sideways. Since I opened it and assembled it, I guess I can't return it. It's headed for the garbaage. We'll go to a store and buy a different one. Not one from KIDS ONLY."
1,Super Shopper Shopping Cart,this product was enjoyed by my grandchildren but was not very durable. It kept falling apart. I would not recommend it for young children nor purchase another one.
1,Don't waste a penny on this....,"It looked cute in the picture, it came with food and money.... but what a peice of junk. My 4 year old wanted a shopping cart with a seat she could put her baby dolls in and someone bought this off our wishlist.... It doesn't hold an average size baby doll, its flimsy, very easy to put together, and the food comes flat that you have to put together, and its not generic food your kid would even know what it is, very dissapointing. Oh yeah and the money, is one sided and you have to cut it out yourself....."
4,Super Shopper Shopping Cart,I bought this product for my niece for Christmas. She absolutely loved it. She spends hours playing with it. We also got her a kichen so she role plays going to the supermarket first then coming home and cooking. She really likes it and plays with it all the time.
1,An Embarrassment!!,"This is one of the most cheaply made toys I have ever seen! (It wouldn't even stay together!) Not only that, it was SO small. After seeing this shopping cart, I don't see how ANYONE can justify the price. I was too embarrassed to give it to my grandchild. I sent it right back!"
5,Great gift for your little shopper!,"These shopping carts are wonderful for your little play-pretender. They're much more realistic than the plastic ones, and easy to assemble as well. We got out son one for Christmas, so we can't exactly judge whether it's really durable, but so far it's endured being pushed up and down the house, and accidentally overturned, too. My son, who's 5, loves it -- he plays supermarket and loads up on groceries, then brings them to his ""restaurant."" It was a great purchase, worth every penny."
3,"Cute, but tiny and flimsy","I recently purcashed this cart for my daughter for her 5th birthday. While very cute, the cart is way too small for a child over 2 and VERY flimsy. I would not purchase it again. I expect it to break any day. (We've only had it a week.)"
3,A happy Shopper,"My son loves it,but not me so much. Not very duriable at all. Its plastic and doesn't have much support for any real item."
2,Not really what expected.,"The description states that the age recommendation is 5 - 7 years (even though the box clearly says 3+), so I thought it was going to be a little bigger. The description also says metal frame, so I didn't think there was going to be so much plastic.There ARE dimensions listed in the description, so I should have looked at it closer, and the recipient really loves it, so if it holds up more than a couple of weeks, I guess the price was ""right"" for such a FRAGILE toy.If this one doesn't last, I will replace it with a different product."
2,Cute but doesn't hold up.,"I liked this one because it was not pink as I was purchasing it for my two sons. However, it continually falls apart and now the wheels don't work very well. I would recommend spending a bit more money and purchasing something more durable. I wish I would have done that."
2,Light Weight Shopping Cart,"My 2 year old daughter loves pushing around furniture pretending they are shopping carts. I decided to purchase this one, because it appeared sturdy enough without costing too much. However, after setting it up, I realized I should have purchased one a bit sturdier. The cart can't hold very much weight before it starts to sag. The wheels are plastic and have difficulty staying in place while pushing (the front wheels often are aligned perpendicular to the cart and so don't roll when being pushed). My daughter sometimes has to pick the cart up or pull it behind her during playtime. However, she has given up the regular furniture to be her carts and this has saved the wooden floors.The play food provided is dinky and undesirable for my 2 year old. They have found a home in the bottom of a box."
1,Horrible toy!!! Cheaply made,Our daughter played with this for 1 day and the wheel broke off. It is very flimsey and cheaply made. We are going to throw out the cart instead of trying to ship it back and pay more $ for that. It's very disappointing.
1,Cheap design,"This shopping cart looks really nice from the picture, but doesn't hold up well. The color of the cart is what sold me, but after receiving this for christmas, it lasted only a couple days. The frame of the shopping cart is metal, the wheels are plastic and the cage is several peices of plastic that is flimsy and snaps together. When it gets pushed into something the cage comes unsnapped. We had to zipstrip it to stay together a little better, but in the long run we wished we hadn't purchased it. Size wise it would be for a 1 - 2 year old. My four year old has to bend down pretty far to push it."
1,Rip Off!,The cart is made of flimsy plastic! Much smaller than it appears. Food items it comes with are silly. Money has been copied so many times that it is blurry! I was embarrassed to give this as a present to my niece. Looks like I paid $2 for it
2,The picture I order Is not the same as what I got !! They changed the picture on here too after my order !!!,"I ordered this because it looked like the real carts at the store and it says its metal but when I got it ..it is plastic. Only the legs of it is metal ...the cart is blue and red Not the realistic one pictured when I ordered it ...But yet they changed the picture on here and all even went up on the price since I ordered it a week ago...I do not recommend it due to they are obviously misleading people by saying it is metal and change items pics after your purchase !! food items very flimsy !! Doubt they last 30 mins**UPDATE** 6 Months later the cart is broken, the plastic pieces that join the cart together are not very sturdy and have cracked, which causes the cart to dip. Buy at your own risk!"
2,Poor craftmanship,"I bought this cart for my then 2 1/2y.o. daughter for Christmas 2006. She very much enjoyed playing with it for the few months that it lasted. While it was very cute, light enough for a toddler and easy to put together, it was made of very cheap material. Without any abuse or misuse by my daughter, it bent so that it is now permanently lopsided and is no longer fun or easy to push. My daughter never tried to climb in it or overload it with heavy objects. It is simply poorly quality and not made to last. I would recommend shelling out the extra dollars for one of the more sturdy carts."
2,All plastic- not metal!,Bought this for my 1 1/2 year old since she likes to push stuff around. The info says metal frame- it is all plastic and snaps together. We put one or two food items in it and it was weighted down and did not push well. I am going to go tomorrow and buy my daughter a metal shopping cart. Also it is very brightly colored- in the picture posted I thought it was metal colored for the most part with some accents- does not look like real shoppoing cart as my 3 yeasr old pointed out!
2,Dangerous toy - that's why says AGE 5 & up,"This toy is designed for a toddler due to its small size, but interestly is advertized for ages 5 & up. I now know why. It's a hazard. Pros: toddlers love pushing it & it's realistic looking. Incidents with this toy include: tot's head got stuck between handle bar and main cart, tot's foot got stuck in bottom tray slats, wheels continually got stuck on deck furniture with the gap they have in middle, causing toddler distress. Also, the cart is light weight enough that my boy is compelled to race it along the walls and on top of tables. Finally couldn't take it anymore and threw this toy out today. Get the Little Tikes plastic cart instead (our kids love those at nearby rec center), which I'm going to buy to replace this one. I used to be anti-plastic, but with tots, no more. Steel and wood products and tots don't mix well. Plastic is far more safe, as companies such as Step2, Mattel and Fisher Price know all so well."
2,SUPER CUTE AND SUPER CHEAP,"THIS IS SO CUTE BUT CHEAP. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE BUT THE BASKET PART IS CHEAP POP TOGETHER PLASTIC. WORTH 10 BUCKS I PAYED $32.00 TOTAL. DON'T GET ME WRONG MY SON LOVES IT, BUT IT WILL NOT LAST. THEY HAD ONE AT THE DOLLAR GENERAL FOR $9.99 I SHOULD HAVE GOT IT. SUPER CUTE WITH A SUPER NOT CUTE PRICE FOR WHAT IS . THE PLASTIC BASKET HAS NO LIP TO THE PART THAT POPS TOGETHER. WELL IT DOESN'T REALLY EVEN POP TOGETHER MORE LIKE SLIDED TOGETHER. METAL FRAME WITH A ""HOUSE OF CARDS"" STYLE CONTRUCTED BASKET."
2,look for more options,"i ordered this before i went to our local store and saw something very similar. the price of the item in our local store was 10 dollars cheaper and was made out of plastic. this is made out of metal and rusted about a week after we got it. we live in a very humid place so i'm sad that i didn't consider that before i ordered this. two weeks later, the rust caused the bottom rack to fall down that my husband had to put electric tape to hold it. now i don't know where it's at. i think it rusted away taking the tape with it. (it was fun while it lasted)"
5,great pretend play,"This cart is so cute and adorable. My 2 year old daughter spends every morning pushing this cart around the house. She even insists on bringing it to the park and pushing it on the paved trails. The cart is light and easy to push, since the front wheels swivel. It takes just a couple minutes to assemble. You will not be disappointed in this purchase."
3,super shopping cart,"the super shopper shopping cart is a very good new product. it will provide fun and enjoyment for you or your kids. the set contains play shopping items like foods and also contains some play money. it will help you or your child enjoy what you do every week, go shopping. you or your child will be entertained and will enjoy the NEW! SUPER SHOPPER SHOPPING CART. my opinion is that it should be used by kids 3+. it might contain items with choking hazard."
2,Very difficult to push,The wheels on the front of the cart turn sideways and prevent it from rolling. My daughter can rarely get the cart to roll properly and thus rarely plays with it. I wish we had bough a different cart that is less frustrating to push.
2,"Super Shopper Shopping Cart- Super tiny, not worth it!","Though the shopping cart is cute, it is super tiny, more for a 2 yr old to play with. I teach Prekindergarten and my class kids had to stoop to use this cart. The items are spread out to make it look like you get a lot of food items. You don't, and they are so tiny they do not appear realistic to use in a home center setting. Buy another cart if you have 4-5 year olds and teach school."
1,Horrible purchase - don't waste your money,All my daughter wanted for Christmas 2011 was a shopping cart. We ordered this one because she liked the colors - went to put it together on xmas eve only to find there were only 2 wheels included in the box. We ended up running to Walmart to get a replacement
3,"Cute and fun, but not durable for children","This is a very cute shopping cart, however it just does not hold up against a 3 year and an 18 month old. It snaps together easily, meaning it also unsnaps easily. They are constantly taking it apart. It hasn't broken, which is good, but we all know how children play: Rough! It would be a good shopping cart for older children, between 5-8, when they are old enough to play gently with it."
5,FUN BOOK,"This book was great. You could really relate to the heroine, and it was a cool twist on the right side/wrong side of the tracks story. One of my favorites when I was a teen. SNEEBLE!"
5,Wonderful Product,"I built a 17' by 12' bench with these brackets and the same composite material my deck is made out of. It is very sturdy and does not have much wobble. I really love that they take up so little of your deck, saving you room. They are easily installed and just what I was looking for! Excellent product!!"
4,Great projects - good instructions,"I had checked this book out from my local public library - the patterns / projects were so good, I wanted a copy to by to use. I especially like the pattern for the gazebo; I'll build this later this year."
5,A perfect gift for the expectant mother,"When Mary Knight was expecting her baby, she felt inspired to write a series of letters to him. Beginning soon after conception and carrying on through pregnancy, birth and beyond, her heartfelt ""love letters"" record one woman's transition into motherhood. More than that, they are the first links of that mysterious mother-and-baby connection.For anyone expecting a baby, this is a wonderful gift. It's a journal to be used and kept, perhaps to share later with your child. There are lots of inviting empty pages for recording your own ""love letters,"" and insightful suggestions to help you get started journaling. Last but not least, this book feels delicious in your hands and opens up nicely for easy, enjoyable writing."
5,perfect!,"this arrived really quick, it was just as the picture showed & it fit great! i am a dancer so i needed this for a recital, it stayed in place the for whole routine, what more could you ask for? :)"
3,Was not what I had ordered,It was described as an InstFurnace heater with a swivel think base. No where did it say InstaFurnace or Holmes; nor did it have a swivel base. It works and is adequate. I was disappointed as a friend had the real thing and through her reccommendation and seeing hers made me think it would be the one I want. Am using the one you sent 'cause it is cold here and am making the best the situation. It was the Holmes PPH3185-U InstaFurnace heater w/swivel base that I had ordered.Not what I got.K.M
3,"Just okay, not exactly the best","If you're looking for just an everyday playset, then by all means, grab this bridge. The price is right but it's really not as sturdy as the Thomas version, which is more pricey. It works okay and will the job, but it has a tendency to come apart rather quickly - to the point where my husband duct-taped it to the board. It isn't as realistic looking either - it just looks like it's made of plastic. Again, it does the job but if you're really a train buff or are buying it for one, you might want to look at the Thomas version."
1,Camera falls out,I've now had this case turn upside down and drop my camera out TWICE. The weight sits on the top so if you open the case without a strong grip it can easily turn upside down. Once I picked up the case by the straps and when the lid wasn't closed. Flip and dump.
4,Good Protection for Canon 60d,"I originally bought the bag for a Canon XSi. When I traded that camera in for a Canon 60d w/18-200mm lens, I assumed a new bag would be needed. Not so. It's a little snug but I have the camera, lens (with hood and UV filter) and camera strap in the case. I even have a lens cloth, RC-1 wired remote, and extra SDHC included. And since it's compact, airplane carry on bags packing is easy. Needless to say, I'm glad I tried it before buying another bag. The Lowepro fits a wide assortment of cameras and lens."
3,Just OK for my needs,"I can't say anything bad about this case, it was my bad judgement in buying it. Sure the camera fits in it (Rebel XS), and it's very well constructed, but I think there could be another pocket or two, just so you can carry the battery charger comfortably.I'll probably go and buy the larger Canon case that has more room than I need, and will fit another lens when I get it."
3,close but no cigar,"I really wanted this to work: I just want a compact, top-loading, shoulder slung holster with ease of access for (a) walking around town (b) when paired with a large overnight bag for trekking... and I like the buckle feature (no zippers to worry about). But unfortunately, it doesn't quite work. When set against your body, it's hard to open: the top flap is such that it folds against you when you try to access the camera and makes it awkward to reach in for the camera (my Nikon 3100 w/ 18/200 lens otherwise fit perfectly). Reversing the setup so the front rests against your body is no better: still awkward. Bottom line: perfect in size, fit, comfort... but fails the ease of access test. I guess I'll have to go with a zipper option."
5,Frost was the first Chicano rapper,"Frost has been called the Godfather of Latin hip-hop. Every chicano should hear this album. His first hit back in 1990 ""La Raza"" is a very deep song it's the first track on the album. I listened to that rola over and over again but it's so firme, it's like this song goes out to the whole mexican race. Other rolas que estas firme are ""La Familia"" which is about mexican families, ""Raza Park"", ""La Raza 2"", and ""Lowrider"" featuring ALT and Mellow Man Ace"
2,Not Detroit's Frost with Dick Wagner,Amazon does it again - lumps everything together with like names. This is Kid Frost not The Frost with Dick Wagner & Donny Hartman from the Detroit music scene of the late sixties-early seventies. Don't they pay any attention to what they're listing?
3,nice produst,"Very nice produst and seems of great quality. However the sizing is not correct. My son is a 12, and I ordered a 16, yet it fits like a 12. Yet if you want a the jacket a little bit ""loose"" you must order a 16 if your son wears 12!!!!"
4,Order a size or two larger,"I bought this for my 9 year old son who is obsessed with any thing armed forces. Based on other reviews stating how small this is made, I ordered two sizes larger than what my son typically wears. My son is scrawny and small for his age. He typically wears a size 8, sometimes a 10 depending on make. I ordered this jacket in a size 12, and it fits him perfectly. It seems to be made well, not too cheaply made. Just make sure you order large."
4,Camo jacket,Very nice quality jacket just wish I wouldve read the reviews before purchasing jacket runs about 3 sizes small I ordered my son a 14 since he wears a 12 and it to small so in stead of paying for shipping it back I sold it to a friend and will now order a 16 the jacket is well made and a great quality so im not going to give up on it yet lol
2,Get out your airpump - it's gonna take a while,"I bought this thinking, it's great - shade, big area etc. well, there's a minimum of 5 air valves to fill up. i think the canopy area has 3-4. and then when you need to deflate it --- takes longer than when you fill it up. some people buy it and then buy the balls as an add on - this i think would be a good use for it. We're in FL so it's hot and sunny and for just 15-30 minutes of splash time with a 7 month old it's not worth having this big thing at the ready. go with the small intex (sp?) yellow/blue shaded pool, it's small enough yet big enough that you don't feel like the baby is sitting in a small tub. i would pass if i was you, thank goodness the price was cheap, otherwise i would really be bummed."
2,"Slow leak- you win some, you lose some","Got this at the start of last summer for my then 14 month old. We enjoyed it until the dome developed a slow leak. Every time she wanted to play in it, I had to find the dirty plug, try to clean the mildew out, and re-blow it up. Dome is not removable, so had to keep reinflating in order to use pool at all. It fit her and her two cousins, sort of, but no way would an adult fit in there. I had been imagining kicking back in her pool with her, but it wasn't sturdy or big enough for that. It's not easy to find an affordable but decent baby pool, but based on this experience, I'd say keep looking!"
4,Shady Beach Baby Pool,"Nice inflatable pool for the price. Has cushioned floor and wide cushioned sides. Canopy shields baby from sun on 3 sides and top and has air holes to enable air flow. Sections inflate separately. Pictures of starfish and seashells on sides are fun for baby. I bought this pool for my daughter, who was 15-18 months this summer. It is working out perfectly so far. We can both fit inside and splash together. I don't know if it will be around next summer (we leave it inflated and just empty it after each weekend use), but it is exactly what I was looking for at this point in time and for her age."
2,not durable,"This got good ratings on Amazon so I got one for the kids. Only used it once because the second time, it won't inflate anymore. There is already a leak."
4,love it,Marry Poppins comes back in this book.Before Marry Poppins came back the Bank's life was a mess.A new Banks child appeared in this book.Her name was Annabelle.Marry Poppins is mean.She leaves at the end.
1,An Indispensable Guide,"James Finley has attempted and accomplished a truly difficult task. He has constructed a book that is helpful to beginning meditators while it is an inspiration to experienced meditators. The chapters of this book look somewhat traditional with familiar concepts like ""A Ladder to Heaven"",""Entering the Mind of Christ."" Yet in each aspect of Christian meditation that he discusses he discovers new depths.One example. Simply but profoundly he describes the flow of thoughts and memories that inevitably discourage those who are seeking the empty mind. He encourages a ""don't accept, don't reject"" attitude that is grounded in compassion for ourselves that mirrors the compassion of God for us.Finley's style itself is meditative with sentences that parallel each other and lend themselves to thoughtful pauses. This is an extremely valuable book for which anyone who reads with a sincere seeking will be grateful. (Rating should be 5 stars)"
5,"Great master, Great teacher","James Finley is not well known yet, but should be. He speaks with the voice of authority and authenticity. His guided meditation is the best I've heard, and I've heard many. The tone and cadence of his voice are entirely consonant with his message. I highly recommend this series, and also his other series, Path to the Palace of Nowhere. We are using that series for group study and meditation, and everyone in the group loves it."
4,A Tale of Two Halves,"The first half of this book is outstanding. I did not have high expectations, and thought this would be a watered down version of meditation. I was very surprised to see how deep Finely goes into practice and the philosophy behind a monastic lifestyle. I was very pleased to see how he uses the writings of some of the great Christian mystics and Buddhist thought. However, the second half of the book is a dud, and concentrates just on basic techniques. Perhaps if the second half had been in front the book might be better overall. It is worth reading just to get the information from the first half."
3,Christian Meditation : Experiencing the Presence of God,Very thourough but maybe to much so. It is a bit much as far as wording goes. Hard to follow and implement.
4,Cute and stackable,"I bought these just so that I could make Game of Thrones lemon cakes and I was not disappointed. They're cute, thick, and stackable. They wash easily and are a great size for small desserts.That being said, I'm sad to say I dropped one out of the fridge a couple of weeks after I bought the set and it broke right in half. *sigh* It's to be expected of course, since they're such small dishes, but I was sad anyway."
3,these are small,"Oh, wow. These are small. They were to be replacements for an older set but they are just too small. Used to use previous set for all kinds of things, yogurt, apple sauce, ice cream.even small treat bowls for the cats. These are maybe suitable for a baby or very small portions. Going to replace with the 10oz size, which is double the size. On the plus side, they do stack very nicely."
5,It depends on how you look at it,"Sure, I miss the wild colors and the wacky dubbing like everyone else but this still has a lot to offer. If SUSPIRIA is Argento's horror version of Disney's SNOW WHITE then MOTHER OF TEARS is his horror version of ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN (with the visual style of a Jack Chick tract) ...and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
4,Better than nothing,After waiting 25 years for this third film in the trilogy it was pretty good but could have been better.
2,Very strange.,"I saw the trailers for this movie and believe me, that is the best it gets. Not a very goodmovie and it does drag on. Save your money for something better."
2,For die-hard Asia Argento fans,"I bought this film because it had Asia Argento and her dad working together again. I suppose I am happy with the purchace only because it keeps my Asia Argento collection complete. as a movie, I felt let down. Typically dark and forbidding, it was, however, poorly written and grossly overacted. Nowhere near as good as Stendahl Syndrome or B.Monkey, one of her finest. But if you are an Asia Argento fan, by all means get it."
2,Visually entertaining at best,There's not much to be said about this film that has not already been said. I've tried to enjoy it on separate occasions: sober and drinking a few beers with it but on both occasions it's apparent that Mother of tears is just a silly film flat on story and large with the gore and violence.The only reason it didn't get one star is because of the gore and nudity which I feel many modern horror films lack now a days.
3,better then the first....,"i saw mother of tears after seeing suspiria(read my reveiw on that film to see my opinion of it).i can honestly say i liked this third installment better.the bllod and gore were well done,the music was decent and i felt the tone was good.the story was also OK but the actress that played the mother of tears left something to be desired.she wasnt all that scary and was barly in the movie at all...when she was she was always naked(not that im complaining about that).over all this is a movie worth looking at if you are a fan of the other two films or not but i sugest you rent it first unless you are a diehard argento fan that you should buy it.if you love horror,blood and gore watch this film and oyu wont be disapointed."
1,The Awful Truth,"I, like the other negative reviewers, actually love Argento. I have most of his work on DVD, and watch Suspiria over and over again.But every negative word you've read is, unfortunately, true. The movie starts out ok, but really degenerates into a mind-boggling mess, and not even an entertaining mess at that.The Mother of Tears is a young porno girl, the effects are wretched. A lot of blood and nudity seems like a good combination, but it isn't. It's just lame and as much as I wanted to love this movie, it is a disaster on every level. I can't imagine what Argento was thinking."
3,Dario's last in the witch trilogy has below par ending!,"Some of the acting was bad.The ending with the Mother of Tears death was the easiest most lackluster killing of the main villian I have ever seen.The kill scenes besides the one I just mentioned are unparalleled to most horror movies I have seen in the last 10 years.The rich colorful panoramic scenes of""Suspira""and""Inferno""are not here but Argento makes up for this with impressive scenes of gore.If you are a fan of Dario Argento,then it's a passable effort."
4,Horrifyingly exciting!,"A dark and bold film, very true and genuine in terms of violence and gore, which naturally disgusts the viewer. Fine performances from Asia Argento, Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni and the rest of the cast. The story lays decent emphasis on satanic influences in a modern world, which makes the whole plot, very interesting and immediately engages your mind.Not a perfect or a fabulous horror film, but a decent horror experience, worth watching."
5,Good job Argeto!,OK it's Not Suspiria but it's a good film and fits right in with the Mother trilogy. If you like Suspiria and Inferno you will like Mother of Tears. Only bad thing about this film is that the FX are not that great.
2,Mother of disappointments...,"Good start, OK middle, awful ending. Some amateurish acting, hokey dialogue, gratuitous nudity, distasteful killings. Way below Argento's best work, ditto for his daughter, who is mediocre in the lead role. The extra features are interesting, though."
3,Mother of Tears...,"Caught this on cable, 09/14/11 in the early a.m. Harsh, very harsh and graphic. Forget what nudity you may see. Poking out someone's eyes? Impaling women with a stake? Crushing throats?Harsh!The acting?Passable.Would I recommend this movie?Not really.By the other Amazoners' opinions, this auteur is a genius.I just don't know...I rate the ""Mother of Tears""...3 stars...Good luck with this one!"
1,God helps those who can'r help themselves,"One of the worst adventure books I have read. Two young adventurers with little knowledge, skill or ability go where they were unprepared to go. Makes me appreciate what natives living in primitive locations have to put up with when American's searching for thrills invade their world."
3,entertaining and informative tale,"This book is about Joel Kramer and Aaron Lippard's harrowing trip across Papua New Guinea. Aaron is my cousin, so that may contribute to a bias on my part.I found this to be an enjoyable, gripping tale to augment what Aaron has told and shown me in slides from his trip. It was marred for me, however, by the preachiness and by what seemed to me arrogance and condescension on the part of the author, especially when writing about how various experiences would teach things to my cousin--while apparently the author had little to learn."
3,Theocracy in the jungle,"While the writers are earnest and sincere, the evangelical overlay often gets in the way of a good adventure story. The fact that the somewhat hapless expedition didn't end in disaster is, in my mind, a shaky premise from which to deduce ""God's will."" Was impressed more by the compassion of those they happened to meet while off on their ""vision quest."""
4,"A mild disclaimer "" I didn't get it""","This complicated,work so full of ambiguity and difficulty in language and style is one I have found almost unreadable. The broad spaces and the great ranging adventurous mind of Melville in Moby Dick(The work which preceded this and in which all of Melville's writing climaxed) is followed by a claustrophic, domestic drama which seems to go nowhere.My sense many other people have a more generous attitude towards this work, than I do and understand it more deeply.As my old high- school Physics teacher Dave Levenstein ( of blessed memory) said when asked about the Theory of Relativitiy-""I read some of that Einstein stuff and I just didn't get it."" In regard to 'Pierre"" I too ""just didn't get it."""
5,Pierre,I could very much like the second book Melville wrote after Moby Dick this man has written just about twelve novels and I would really enjoy reading this for a comparative paper I have to write.
3,Ambiguities indeed!,"I found this to be a much better Book Club selection than just a classic read. It is the tragic story of a young man who is naive in the world and his life quickly dissipates into ruin. Herman Melville published this novel a year after Moby Dick. I would not necessarily recommend it, but I thought it was an interesting work, especially if you are interested in the career of Melville."
2,Planting Wetlands & Dams: The Way I See It!,"The author specializes in Australian waters and plants. The book was way to small to include all that is need to cover this topic. Further, it is over priced for its size. With that said, the book does offer a good overview into the topic of the creation and enhancement; however little! Some of the diagrams are good (not great) but the color pictures in the center of the book adds greatly to its attractiveness and does provide examples. This is more of a discussion than a guide. It does cover good topics and it would add to supplement anyones library of other such books with more detailed information. A good plant list is included; however, wetland work in America requires using plants based on reference wetlands species. If you have money to spend, buy it. If you are on a budget, pass and get a different book."
5,Free Expression As Revolution,"This compilation of Ian Brown singles is a must for any fan of the Stone Roses or UK music in general. Taken mostly from his three studio albums, The Greatest also features a couple new tracks, most notably 'All Ablaze'. For those that haven't purchsed Brown's post-Roses albums, this album makes for a good primer."
1,Tastes like you're eating the forest,"If you like grainy, course, and dry tasting cereal, this is for you.We're a family of 5, all health nuts, fit, and we love to cook and garden so we know our foods......and let me say that this cereal was a little tough to accept. I think half of it was given to our parrots, they liked it more than we did.Sorry, just being honest.We've not tried any of this companies other products, yet, so not sure what else they make/sell."
5,Still the king of LDS pop music...,"Most the music on this CD was released over 20 years ago, and still no LDS pop music I have ever heard can touch it and I still listen to it regularly...must have listened to these songs over a thousand times by now...they really need to re-release all his albums on CD...it is a shame Bryce does not get the credit he deserves...his name should be revered in LDS cirles. His songs are catchy, touching, often beautiful, and always inspiring...and they are not overly cheesy like most of the 80's LDS pop stuff (afterglow and the like). This should be in every LDS home."
4,Armed and Dangerous...,"From the back cover: ""Stay where you are. I've got a gun."" Tate Cantrell froze in the doorway of her isolated mountain cabin. The big, bearded stranger wielding a revolver was an escaped convict, an embezzler - and a murderer. But he was also badly hurt - and in desperate need of her help.The man calling himself Carl Petersen was determined to find the treacherous double-dealer who'd set him up. But that was before a gunshot wound stranded him in the Ozark wilderness, before the outlaw moon led him to the enchantress who brought him back to life - and unleashed the most powerful desire he'd ever known.He longed to spend a life sentence in her arms, but he had to start running again. Because if they were caught together, he might not be the only one to pay with his life."
5,Product and delivery very acceptable,"Received the item in a very timely manner. It has already been installed by a local plumber. I like the design, in part because there are NO parts to rust out over time. This unit is being used along with a Mainline fullport Backwater valve, which if properly maintained I expect will assure my of NO MORE sewage backing up in to my basement."
1,From barely adequate to useless,"When they were knew, the duration of light was barely adequate, but it was good enough to use in an emergency. Back then, I would get a few minutes of decent light for a minute of light cranking). Within a few short years, they got worse; I know this because I tested them periodically. Now, I get less than 30 seconds of dim light for a minute of vigorous cranking, making them useless."
5,Great Lights but.........,"These are great lights but the price listed is too high. You can get the same product at Costco for $19.99 if they have them in. At that price, they go fast."
1,Not a rating low enough available!,"These things are an absolute joke! Even when new they would not hold a charge for more than 2-3 mintues after 1 minute of cranking. And now that they are older, it is 30 seconds of use after 2 minutes of cranking! Great idea but the product stinks!"
2,Good while it lasts,I enjoy no longer having to search for batteries to make the flashlight work. I do not enjoy cranking for a full minute and only getting 3 minutes worth of light. 1 minute of cranking does NOT give you 1 hour of light. I would suggest another brand.
3,DuraPRO Measurements,"I took one of these flashlights apart to find out how the charging part worked. I couldn't believe you could actually charge a battery in 1 minute. I measured about 60 mA for the 3 LED's while running and about 25-30 mA charging current. This means you crank about 2 to 3 times the ""on"" time. Of course, when the flashlights are new, they're all charged up. 120 mA-hour battery, so they can run quite a while before they really need charging. In the end though, you'll need to crank 2 to 3 hours to get 1 hour of run time. Still OK for some applications."
1,Short Battery Life,"Those who rated this flashlight so highly will have a VERY different opinion in time. It seems that everytime the battery is charged, it remains charged for a shorter period of time. Eventually you will have to crank nonstop because the battery will hold no charge at all. That is my experience."
5,Great! Great! Great!,My three daughters have been fighting over who is going to read the next one first. They have just not been able to put them down. They got the first two sets at Christmas and I had to order the other 4 sets cause they have not stopped one day until they read all 40 books. They really loved them. I think it gave them a better understanding of the book of Revelation. I recommend them to all teenagers.
5,Left Behind Kids,"This is excellent for kids. I got the first series for my 11 year old granddaughter, who is not much of a reader. She loves the books and is really into reading them. She always is carrying one with her. I read the adult series when they first came out and loved them as well. I think the Left Behind Kid series is a good way to get Bible discussion going with the kids."
2,Cheaply made and poor quality,"Bought this to replace my Jeep TV/Radio/CD player, similar set up. This was much cheaper in quality and now that the TV signal requires a converter box, the TV is basically useless. The cd player works and the sound quality isn't too bad. I have to give this a thumbs down, although if you're looking for something to play in your workshop or garage it'll do the job. Just handle it with care."
1,Boring and Slow,"I don't like this game at all. I think the players move too slow, and it seems impossible for them to change directions quickly. I also think the power of the shots are mostly the same. I think this game is extremely boring and I regret buying it."
2,Broke after first cleaning,"Worked nicely for three weeks, ultra quiet and easy to fill. But after the first cleaning it refused to run again. The power light wouldn't even come on. Too delicate? Bad design? Manufacturing defect? Who knows. Returned to Bed, Bath and Beyond, tryng a Vortex model."
1,Poor quality and construction,"According to their advertisement, it's the #1 selling humidifier in Germany. Germans would not put up with it's poor quality and construction. I maintained it as instructed but after a few uses, it started leaking. Luckily I live relatively close and can bring it to their factory. The cap on the tank is leaking. It's a $5.00 part, but costs $7.95 to ship????? It's light-weight plastic and no more than 4in in diameter. This was the most expensive portable humidifier, which goes to show that you don't always get what you paid for. The carpeting and hardwood floors are soaked. Needless to say that I would NOT recommend Venta Sonic."
4,A Good Product For Its Use,I bought my Venta Sonic VS100 about 2 years ago at my local Bed Bath and Beyond Store. I liked the choice between warm or cool mist and that the Venta Sonic was quiet. I have had humidifiers in the past that were loud enough to keep me awake and the Venta Sonic is much quieter. The only problems I have with this product is being able to clean the inside. We have hard water and no matter how often I empty the water or try to clean it I still end up with hard water stains. The other problem is now I can not buy the filter cartridges in the Bed Bath and Beyond store. The store manager said that Venta has stopped manufacturing the VS100 in the United States and that the BBB website has a limited amount of filter cartridges available. He said when the website runs out I will have to buy a new humidifier. The store manager also said I should call Venta and demand that they start manufacturing the VS100 again.
1,It did not last long,"I purchased this humidifier less than 6 months ago. Like Bill, it did not make it through the winter. Just quit working. It did a great job while it worked, but I don't appreciate a product that doesn't last."
1,Expensive landfill,"So disappointed in this product! Bought this last year and it is completely useless now. It stopped working a few times last season, as others have reported in their reviews, and worked intermittently from then on. Now it's not working at all after cleaning it according to instructions. Was great when it actually worked. I didn't know how much my hubby paid for this item until I decided to write a review! Aghh! We have an extra filter too that will now go to waste."
2,expensive humidifier,"This product is very expensive. It eats filters if you`re on well water. I have to clean the unit more frequently then is normal--everytime i change the water, and the filters, when they work, need to be changed once a week at $.13.88 a pop. i bought this to avoid having to buy distilled water, but that was a mistake. It humidifies well, but I know there are better cheaper ones out there."
1,VentaSonic Humidifier,"This humidifier does not work except when set at the lowestsetting. When we turned it up one evening it spewedwater all over the carpet...a real mess to clean up. We bought itfrom the Ace Hardware Outlet and even though they will give us arefund they will not reimburse us for sending it back which I thinkis a real rip-off. I wouldn't expect to be compensated if I had just changed my mind but this is DEFECTIVE merchandise. Think twice before buying this humidifier. It's a dud and the instructionbook is very vague. And, avoid Ace Hardware Outlet!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I purchased this unit from BB&B; and brought it home. I unpacked the unit, filled it with water and allowed the filter to soak. Got everything all set and turned the unit on....NOTHING....no light...thought that maybe the outlet was bad and tried another one....nothing as well. Back to BB&B; for a replacement. Brought the replacement home and noticed that the little stopper for letting water past the filter was broken off so the water would just flow out when the tank was held with the handle...figured no big deal, i'll just be quick getting it onto the base on starting it up. Plugged it in and turned the unit on....NOTHING....no light AGAIN.Like other posters, i wanted to hurl this thing into the street and drive over it with my car!!! I am going to be returning this to BB&B; and staying away from this company. I guess i was being naive thinking that the more expensive unit is going to be the better built one....hahaha"
1,Beware--product stops working before end of season,"I purchased 3 venta sonic humidifiers: 2 for home and 1 for office. Within a week, one stopped working, other two wouldn't work consistently. By the end of season, all three had stopped working. It is a great looking product, with seeming advantages, however, there must be some fundamental engineering problem. At $100 a pop, this is an extraordinary BAD purchase.Good luck to all."
5,So far so good...[still nice after 7 months] - have 2 now.,"Nice and quiet, can be moved without water sloshing out. I put mine on a dresser to push the air more in the middle of the room. Previously I thought it would be possible to just remove the ""aimer"" and have the mist come out the top of it, but it makes it creates a dissatisfactory noise when this happens [no big deal though, just use the ""aimer"" as designed]. The Venta started misting practically immediately on the cool setting which was impressive compared to a prior humidifier I had. Overall a fantastic purchase."
2,sent it packin,"could not for the life of me keep it running. kept propping a part of it up and would run for awhile, then shut off. took it back and still searching for the right humidifier."
2,great until the oscillator died,"Bought this in November and it worked great... for a while. I can't say I got what I paid for.Scale accumulated quickly on the rubber ring holding the oscillator and a greenish scum formed in the water above the oscillator if left for a few days, so it needs cleaning regularly. (You'd think the $15 filters would prevent that...) Then last month the oscilattor gave out. Took it apart and found a metal film from one pole of the oscilattor plate had cracked near a soldered connection. Didn't even make it through the winter. It's headed for the dumpster, which is where it seems my money went on this one.No more ultrasonic humidifiers for me... at least not $99 ones!"
3,good general map of australia,For traveling Australia's highways and main city roads this map was quite good as the maps are quite large and easy to read. But there is not much detail for the smaller streets in the main cities and forget about any sort of details for smaller towns
4,Perfect map. Nice price.,"In my opinion, you don't need an atlas for Australia like you do in the USA. I bought this map and I also drew some of my own more detailed city maps off of Google. I used my hand drawn maps alot more because getting from city to city was incredibly easy with the road signs already in place. But there was no way for me to know that in advance and I felt much safer to have this map in hand. I did have a problem with the shipping (UPS or FedEx). They couldn't find my address that most definitely existed and kept sending it back without so much as a phone call or email. When I finally got it weeks later, there was a huge chunk torn out of New South Wales. Amazon quickly replaced it and that idiot shipping company found my house much quicker that time."
4,Just what you'd expect,"I'm planning a driving tour of Australia, and finding good consistant maps has been a challenge. This atlas is just like you'd expect - large pages with readable notations and plenty of close-up city maps."
1,AA ROAD ATLAS AUSTRALIA,UNFORTUNALY I AM STILL WAITING MY ROAD ATLAS AFTER OVER 1 MONTH FROM MY PURCHASE.AMAZON IS A VERY BEAUTIFULL SERVICE AND I HOPE IN A REPLY TO MY QUESTION TO THE AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE.
2,"Great Watch, Bad Service",I ordered this watch online from Amazon and it arrived in record time (2 days) with standard shipping. I was really impressed until I noticed that the battery in the watch was completely dead on arrival. How a company can ship $165 watches to people without first checking to see if they're at least ticking is beyond me. I think this is completely inexcusable and warrants me a full refund of the $25 it cost me to have the battery replaced on arrival.
2,spoilt by poor soloists,"I am also of the opinion that the critic's enthusiasm for this recording is not justified. Haitink does a reasonable enough job even if he is a bit slow at times and the LPO play wonderfully for him but for me the real spoiler is the two soloists - Summers is I'm afraid just too bland with almost no melody to the voice whatsoever - just listen to Carol-Case on the 1968 Boult recording and you willl hear how wonderful this music can sound and I think Lott is decidedly overwhelmed by the score and produces some pretty awful sounds, quite off pitch!!A big disappointment then and not to be recommended there are other much finer recordings out there and the aforementioned 1968 Boult/LPO remains my favourite."
2,Boring,"This book is like a patchwork quilt with the seams way too obvious and disratcing. It was cobbled together, forced, lacking spark. Stick to the greats."
2,Les Mediocres...Like A Treadmill -- Ending Up Nowhere,"Again, very choppy overall. My hope of discovering something was disappointed by the average to poor writing and disjointed reading experience. One would think two people could keep each other interesting but maybe the converse holds true. This genre seems to suffer from inbreeding. It's chock full of aspiring writers who consider themselves expert because they've read luminaries. They then strive to be writers, the drive is out of ambition, and they end up criticizing each other into monotony. Les Mediocres remain peripheral to talent as long as they spend too much time picking apart each other and the craft. The question that addresses the problem may be, where are the editors who keep this level of blah from congesting the shelves. I suppose it's all right that the sentences and puctuation are correct if you just want to engage your mind like being on a treadmill, ending up nowhere."
4,Good Read,"I enjoy a good space opera, and this is one. I like that it's a book you can read a little at a time."
4,I Would Listen to van Dam Sing the Yellow Pages,Episodic and untheatrical in that maddening- unsatisfying way of 20th century opera-- but try to focus on the vocal performances. van Dam is as eloquent and sings as beautifully as you expect. Listen for the hair-raising Sphynx scene-- Lipovsek is amazing in this small part- one of the scariest things you'll hear in an opera recording anywhere. In fact- just look at all the big names in the cast list-- somebody must have really called some favors in.
3,Inconsistent,"I enjoyed the first 120 pages of Krugman's book. It was very readable and given his biases, I thought, very fair. At that point the discourse becomes an indictment of the ""Supply Siders"". The evenhandedness disappears and one sided views of all conditions,actions and results take over. I am surprised by the large number of ""5"" level reviews. In reading them it is obvious that many of these reviewers have some experience in economics and must be aware of the not only the fallacies of Krugman's conclusions but the bias with which he treats the facts."
4,A great book I had to read it twice,"A highly readable book about economics even for those not interested in the subject. The author is one of the few economists who can explain the subject so clearly and rationally in plain English. I don't necessary agree all of the viewpoints in this book, but this is so intelligually sumulating that really impresses me."
5,Great Book,"I never read a book on economics before this one because I could never understand them. I don't know why I picked this one to read, but it was wonderful. It is the first time ever that I have actually understood anything at all about economics. Reading this book was a wonderful experience. Actually out of five stars I would give it ten."
1,Wrong conclusion from the start,"Krugman has bought into the myth that we are forever going backward and that true progress for all is impossible. This is completely wrong. He may not be as extreme as Marx, but he still believes in the ""limits to growth"" school of economics. No how much evidence is produced to debunk this, it is still the foundatation for benighted folks like Krugman. He has no understanding of innovation and why wealth is unlimited in today's world. He also throws up extreme views and then shoots them down, such as claiming that many argue for no role for government. Goodness, how silly and extreme can you get? If you want to liberate your mind and see the unlimited possibilities of the human mind see anything by Milton Friedman."
5,"Want April Love released, NOW","I grew up in the 50's and enjoyed the movies. Not like the blow em up blood letting garbage now. The bold colors, and clean theme of the movie was very calming. You could go to a movie and absorb the wonderful concept of the film. Please release this movie as soon as you can."
3,Lukewarm,"It is a book you half to read if your Dragonlance fan but it not a book that will stand out in your mind. It probably the least memorble book of the series, but still not terrible."
1,The worst DL book ever,"The adventure was ridiculously far-fetched. The basic idea: decribe Kitiara and Sturm's journey together, was good. It's just when the authors decided to put it into writing that it became terrible. Flying to the moon? Fantasy is supposed to be fantasy, but this takes it to it's awful extremes.The writing style was horrible. I didn't feel that I could connect with any of the characters. The gnomes were just silly.I felt this book was a disgrace to the entire DL series, and the publishers should think twice before putting one of the books by these authors out into the shops."
4,Surprising,"The main reason for the 4 stars, is the fact that the synopsis of the book is somewhat misleading. The synopsis says that this story is about Sturm's search for his father and Kitiara's early merc. days. In fact, after reading this book, it seems that the search for his father was actually a sub-plot (with the majority of the adventure happening on the moon). As far fetched as it seems (and one wonders if Thompson and Carter have been into Otik's finest ale) for the happenings to take place on the moon, the overall story is really good. The gnomes (adding a sense of humor), a wise-cracking brass dragon, a mad man marooned and ruler of the tree-people on the moon, crystal ants, and magicians are present from page one. A really good read."
2,So many wrong things,"This book is very weak, It has so many plot holes that it has taken me a full year to finish reading. The setting is before the war of the lance, yet there are many cleric and draconian refferences. The only reason it did not get a lower mark, is because they did do a good job with Sturm and Kit's personality. Not a good read, buy at your own boredom."
3,Darkness and Light,"This book overall is ok. I mean, yes it tells you about Kitara and Sturms thing together, but where the stroy took place should have been somewhere different. But, if you are a true DragonLance reader, you gotta read this one."
2,Not a bad book but not a very good book,"I picked this one up at a second hand book store for 2 reasons. 1) It was a Dragonlance book 2) It was cheap. I read it and at one point I thought, "" Hey this is pretty good so far"" Then the part of draconians came up and that ruined it for me. I couldn't help but think the author was winging this one. I sat there thinking,"" Didn't the companions first run into the draconians in the chronicles books?"" as in the first books of the Dragonlance series??? Hey if you love Dragonlance read it, but only if you can't find a better book in the series first."
3,A good book but not correct with the actual saga,"A very good story. Any true Dragonlance fan would enjoy reading about the trip of Sturm and Kit on their journey. The only problem that I had with the book, and for that matter any of the preludes that I have read, is that the book contradicts the actual storyline of the chronicles. Sturm had never seen a dragon before the first Chronicles book nor had he heard of Draconians. Yet they are both in this book. Other than that though a very good book."
4,Good Book,I was a somewhat disapointed that you did not find out how Sturm and Kit fall in love. The trip they take is an amazing jurney that takes them out of this world. The gnomes were very amusing to read about. There isn't much more to say except that I would have to say reea this book.
1,Skip it!,"I read this book when it first came out, when I was 15, and it's still prominent in my mind. Not, however, because it was good. It doesn't fit in at all with the Dragonlance universe, and is in fact completely ludicrous. The characterizations are off, the plot is laughable, and the writing style is poor. There are so many wonderful books out there; it would be a shame to spend your time reading this one."
3,Hmmmmmm?,"Well, I won't say that this is a bad book, but is was definately not the best. While it was an interesting story, it relly didn't fit in with to rest of the series. I like how Sturm and Kit are portrayed, but I found the whole idea of landing on Lunitari a little out of it. The gnomes are really cute, and the ending is actually pretty good, so I guess it's not that bad!"
1,Diabetics stay away from this one!,"Mr. Brunner's commentaries on Morning Edition are the reason why I no longer tune in to that show.These essays are pure marshmallow fluff, utterly devoid of any substance save a warm, sugary goo that leaves one gasping for air. They are pure Southern cliché of the worst kind--the stuff that Yankee tourists want to hear about when they venture South of the Mason-Dixon line.Brunner makes Bailey White look like William Faulkner."
2,"Fast, but a bit flimsy","I had about an 8' straight run to put a bench in, so used four brackets. Is was fairly quick (about 2-2.5 hours, I have a power miter saw), and instructions were clear. Once installed, there was too much ""wobble"" in the bench - front-to-back, not side-to-side. Luckily, I had posts on the end I could brace it to, so the end result is fine, if you don't have something to brace the ends to, I'd think twice. Lastly, the bench itself is not that comfortable (I find the seat too shallow). Also, the hardware is not the highest quality, and I anticipate it will rust rather quickly (I used stainless steel deck screws to fasten the back and lower front rails). Lastly, pay extra close attention to the washers you use - very similar OD, with a different ID made me redo about 5 screws (my fault, I know). I am and advanced DIYer (I built the 450 sqft three level deck the bench was for)."
3,"GOOD IDEA, BUT WRONG COLOR","These brackets would probably been a really great thing...EXCEPT they are NOT Sand in color, but the ugliest, don't match anything, clash with everything shade of light olive drab you can imagine. If this does not convince you, buy one set to see for yourself. I, on the other hand, bought five and one-half sets to complete my project. Amazon gave me full credit for five sets, but I had to 'eat' the single I purchased (not through Amazon, but one of Amazons sublets). If you can find a color you can live with, these appear to be sturdy, easy to install brackets to finish your deck. These would be especially good for small decks where you want to save some room."
1,"Hot Yoga is Cold, Cold, Cold","I purchase many yoga tapes and DVDs, and can usually find something of value in all of them. This particular DVD, however, found me challenged to list anything it had going for it -- other than the very good looking male yogis. Still, once you get beyond the buff bods and glistening sweat, there is absolutely no substance to this DVD. If Amazon allowed you to return DVDs after opening them, I'd definitely be returning this one. It is brief beyond belief, with nothing new -- no interesting posture variations, no instructions beyond the most rudimentary and no reason to add it to your collection. A wiser purchase would be ""Better Sex Through Yoga for Gay Men."" It provides a good workout, with yogis that may not be as good looking but inspire you nevertheless."
1,"If I Could Give This Zero Starts, I Would","I guess I ""misunderstood"" the ""hot yoga"" thing. This DVD is totally worthless."
1,alternative lifestyle yoga,It should be labeled for males with alternative life styles...good thing i don't have little kids..I wish i had checked into this video before I bought it..
5,This DVD gets an A+ from a yoga rookie,"Well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out some of these reviews below appear to be written by the competition, or friends of the competition of this product. I bought ""Better Sex Through Yoga,"" and being honestly frank it is totally boring, and the guys are boring! This DVD is what it says it is, a very basic yoga program. However, THESE GUYS ARE HOT!!! I'm a beginner, this DVD did it for me in more ways than one. It relaxed me, and the sensuality was HOT! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the basics, in a very interesting and non threatening way. And three gorgeous hunks in athletic jock straps, with many close up's, sure makes it fun. I highly recommend, and have told my friends, and they highly agree. Great for a party also, it heats up the crowd!"
5,If you're going to buy one book for the MBA process...,"This book is one of the best publications I've read on the MBA applications process. The author makes sure to use examples of the ""dos"" and ""donts"" of MBA applications. Moreover, his examples regarding essays and recommendation letters are excellent. They really show the difference between having an okay essay and the excellent essay that will make your application stand out.All in all, this book has proven to be an extremely useful tool to get through a long and difficult process. It gets rid of the myth of ""I'll work it out as I go along"" for graduate business school applications."
3,You have better choices,"I buy also ""ABC of Getting the MBA Admissions Edge"" and online book from top10mba.com. If let me choose again, I won't buy this one. It cover only basic idea and most of the 88 tips are only common sense. It can only be served as a reminder and not worth your time on it. And it didn't worth the price. Not recommanded."
2,compact file sorter,"Nice heavy duty steel construction, compact footprint. Would have been highly rated by me if it had been shipped professionally; no packing material at all was used... arrived with light single box intact but all vertical dividers are bent and look distorted/repaired even after straightening. Should have been boxed using some packing material by MMF/Amazon."
1,Lifeless,"I'm a huge fan of his hey-day years of '73-'76, and absolutely love his guitar wizardry! However, the majority of his 80's to present releases have been bland and sterile. This one is no exception, pointless and boring drivel, regardless of how good the playing is. I'm not expecting much of the new live DVD either. Why wait until the guy is 60 before releasing a DVD? I will admit the Another Days Blues album isn't too shabby, more blues and less of the lifeless banality."
4,A More mature Trower,"'Living out of time' is considerably better than the past few releases when Trower was a trio. Those releases were terrible: i.e: 20th Century Blues/This was now/Disc 2, etc. That setup didn't work well so now Trower is back to a 4 piece. 'LOOT' to me, is a laid-back affair. There are no balls-out rockers here featuring the usual Trower pyrotechnics, that's a shame too because fans know what he is capable of. The playing is top flight, vocals are very good. Sound quality is also very good. 'LOOT' doesn't remind me of any particular past release, the guitarwork is more mellow. Only on track 11 do things heat up a bit. I think he is headed in the right direction with this lineup. Maybe the next release will be a little heavier. 11 tracks/51.09. The booklet is sparse, just credits/no lyrics."
2,"Welcome to the ""No Spin"" Zone !","I am a professional guitarist and have been a Trower fan since the 70's, but I'm gonna tell you the truth about this CD. I do not agree with other reviewers that say the old Robin Trower is back. All these songs are immediately forgettable. The problem is not with Trower's playing, or the band, or the production, but the songwriting. There is no ""Day of the Eagle"" here; no ""Little Bit of Sympathy;"" no ""Too Rolling Stoned,""....NO ENERGY AT ALL! Most of the songs are slow, dreamy, and dirge-like. Where is the rhythm and blues influence that set apart Robin Trower's first several CD's? The last CD this group of musician's recorded...""Passion""...stood heads above this one. As Dick Cheney would say, ""The fact of the matter is..Robin Trower needs a good songwriter. His music used to be more than just a showcase for his guitar skills. His songs used to make you smile and want to tap your feet and dance a bit and say ""Yes!!"" What's wrong with that?"
2,Far From His Best,"To me this CD has none of the brilliance most of Robin Trower's CDs have.There is a very long guitar solo on I Want To Take You With Me, but it is nothing special compared to the many other long solos Robin has blessed us with. In other words, just about any guitarist that doesn't have Robin's virtuosity could play it.Other solos are few and far between, which is a disappointment.You can't win them all but Robin wins on most - just not this one."
4,Trower on song,"If you don't have a copy of Bridge of Sighs you are missing an essential CD from your rock/blues collection. That's where the magic started. Since then there have been flashes of the same genius on Long Misty Days, and Victims of the Fury. The main ingredients were of course Trowers soaring guitar and Jimmy Dewars vocals.If you enjoyed those then this album is for you. Dave Bronze does an excellent job on vocals replacing the sadly departed Mr Dewar, and an added bonus is the recording quality is very good. I would only give a CD 5 stars if it's outstanding - e.g. Bridge of Sighs. Compared with that I give it 4 stars and recommend it strongly to Trower fans."
1,less lyrics more guitar,why does robin refuse to play guitar like he did in the 70's - i'm a fan and have or have heard all his albums - i read the reviews at amazon and thought that he finally returned to his past glory - but again i was let down - no matter how many times or how loud i play this disc - it is not good - sorry robin - less lyrics - more guitar.
4,Great ballads; smashing vocals!,"I would like to remember Mr. Roger Software that the stunning vocals on this album are NOT from Dave Bronze, but from Davey Pattison, one of the best rock singers at these days. Anyway this cd reveals Trower as an artist whose job gets better from time to time, as a good wine."
4,Wonderful Resource for Adoption Participants,"There are some beautiful songs on this CD that pertain to adoption specifically and some that don't necessarily but could be used in that venue. The ones that pertain to adoption specifically are great for birth mothers, adoptive parents and children. I would recommend this for anyone who is part of the adoption process."
5,The perfect book!,"This sex book is filled with 69 super-short stories. They get right to the ""heart"" of the matter. Featured are some top erotic writers, but I actually liked all the stories, even by authors I hadn't read previously. I really liked a few by Rachel K. Bussel and one about a girl on a rooftop by M. Christian that was totally hot. I thought I'd read a few a night, but I ended up reading the whole book in one weekend. And then my boyfriend took it with him and did the same thing on a business trip...read the entire book in an evening. You just can't put it down."
3,fun easy read,"If your just looking for some fun, easy erotica, this is good. DOn;t count on any intricate stories."
4,"Sometimes a chore, often a joy","This was a book that I had to study for my course, and so I approached it with suspicion. However, the characters are fabulously sculpted and the book grabs your attention. I am now a confirmed fan of Balzac and will be reading more of his works in the future."
1,Science Fiction: A Reader's Checklist and Reference Guide,"I was very disappointed with this so called checklist. I expected (or rather I hoped for) something similar to 'Detecting Women' and 'Detecting Men', (both by Willetta Heising) where I could find lists of books by authors in the Sci Fi field. Instead, I end up with reviews of books (1 per author) of 50 selected writers. This is NOT a checklist! It's just a book of reviews of someone's favorite sci fi authors - not mine!"
1,Kidnapped by Nova...,"This is a very subjective work on the subject. Can't be better in a skeptical way. If you are skeptical and subjective then you are destructive. If so you better shut your mouth. People need to learn and to know by themselves, they don't need somebody to know for them. This is not information but disinformation of course.There was a good one, made before this one and called: ""Kidnapped by UFOs"", without the ""?"".Strangely it seems impossible to find it anymore... If it is still possible, it is much harder anyway. And that's not understandable for a much better made documentary."
2,Boring,"One of the joys I got out of using the 1970s hardcopies as a youngster was to stumbling across tonnes of other topics of interest as I narrowed in on what I was after. Now with the search engine, there is no alphabetical index that alows me to do this. I search for a topic, it gives me that only. If I only know the first few letters of a word I'm looking for, the search engine won't help me. Please put in that index and it will raise the product's edutainment value by 100%"
1,Buyer Beware,This piece of software is very buggy and holds less information than advertised. The scroll boxes didn't refresh correctly so that I was unable to read the information in the box without closing and reopening the box.When searching for information on Red Foxes I was unable to find more than a generic article on foxes in general. If you can't find specific information on the most prevalent subspecies then what good is it?
1,huappauge: a fuzzy dud,"I bought this product based on the reviews i read in the amazon.com section for the huappauge INTERNAL WinTV Personal Video Recorder. Those reviews were fantastic and they raved about the product so I thought the usb one would be just fine, but that was not the case. First I recieved the PVR without the remote control but I thought if the product was going to be as good as its ""sister"" (the internal one) then I might as well keep it. It was not. The picture was horrible and terribly fuzzy, and it skipped frames every fews seconds. So i returned it and I am now trying to go through reviews for other tv tuners to see if there are any decent ones out there. So anyways, I just wrote to warn others that this product is not a good one."
1,don't waste your time with this product,"I have great Dell 2XXX series machine. EVERY other product plugs into USB and works flawlessly. This one does not. Tech support was waste of time. Said to update Dell USB drivers. Already did. Device is NOT certified by Microsoft nor are the Hauppauge Drivers! Power on the unit (straight out of box) was unreliable. Power Light would fail 90% of time I plugged it in (during ALL those resets tech support tried to walk me through). In a day and age of plug and play and USB2 gear, this product is a joke. Please don't waste your time with it. Install software even thought this was a PCI bus internal! a real mess."
1,Poor Performer,"This product has never worked properly. it tends to overheat when in normal use so you can't leave it plugged in all the time, but if you plug it in when your computer is on the drivers will not recognize it properly until you restart. Slightly sad for a USB product. The only tech support solution I have recieved is to update my drivers, only I've done that about ten times and the thing still doesn't work. I recommend buying a ATI All-In-Wonder card instead of this tuner. ATI's product will be an upgrade to your graphics card in addition to providing PVR functionality, although it does require opening your PC's case. Still, it will save you from wasting money on a product that does not work."
4,Good for educational Leapster game.,My daughter is 10 yrs old & enjoys this Leapster game because she loves the School House Rock songs. I enjoy that it is educational.
3,Unrealistic,"I love baseball very much. It makes me sad, however, that this is the only baseball game available for the Xbox 360. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun and most of its cons are easy to look over except for one: AI defense.The game infuriates me when it shows that I hit a homerun and an AI outfielder climbs 39 steps up the wall and catches the ball with his back facing it. The defense makes EXTREMELY unrealistic and unfair plays. This takes away from the game and makes me not want to play it.Another thing is the hitting. The pitches come at you too fast to distinguish if it is a strike or not. It seems more luck than skill. Also, the rosters aren't as up to date as they could be.Overall, the game is fun but the AI defense is insane."
3,fun but won't save,It is a great game and is fun there is a few flaws. One of the huge ones is that after playing for about two hours it will say there is no storage in your game system of course I bought it used so it could also be screwed up.
5,Great product in a shallow market,Great game overall. A little buggy in spots. Don't exactly care for some of the interface in GM Mode. Dramatically changes batting lineups on you if one player gets hurt. Overall a nicely delivered game though. I would like to see a little more personalization to the Career mode.
4,MLB 2K7 hits the ball out of the park,"Major League Baseball 2K7 is a baseball simulation game geared towards a more experienced gamer audience. The game offers multiple game-play choices, such as quick game, season, franchise, GM career, manager challenge, online multiplayer, and five different types of home run derby's. Children under 10 and Players with limited gaming experience will find it very difficult to even make contact with the ball in the first couple hours of playing the game. Pitching is slightly easier, but players will rarely ""strike out"" the computer if a pitch was not performed 100%. Overall, Major League Baseball 2K7 is a great looking game offering many choices and customization options. If you are looking for a hardcore baseball game this one is for you. For easy pick-up-and-play entertainment and family fun you are better off with Nintendo Wii Sports Baseball."
4,beautiful game,"this game is aethesticaly beautiful on high def. the player models are awesome and the game is a joy to watch. gameplay is solid, and you can customize your/AI game to have a virtually competitive game every time you play. 2k sports listened to all the complaints last year and delivered unlike madden."
1,This Game Sucks So Bad,"I am so glad that I rented this game. Because the game is garbage with a $60.00 price tag. 2k sports proves yet again why they are an inferior franchise.The Good:Pitching is O.K. sometimesThe Bad:Controls are garbage.The game is not realisticBase Running is impossibleHitting with the ""hit stick"" makes me want to throw my controller out of the window after I try to hit a home run and the player bunts.The Fielding sucks, it's not accurate at allThe game is not fun at allThe graphics suck for a Next Gen GameMLB should be embarrassed that this is it's only title out there. I think it's about time that we get some competition out there. No-one would buy this game if there was an alternative. Mario Baseball for Gamecube is better than this game.I am glad I rented it and did not pay $60.00 for it."
5,Baseball at its finest!,"I was a little scared to purchase this title because I've been burned by almost every baseball game I've ever played. They've all been so complicated and over thought that I can't even get a base hit nevertheless win a game. Fortunately 2K decided to release this title! I love the camera angles, the pitching system, the batter's eye (it's like a built-in mini-game), the team customization, etc. This game hit a homerun in my book! Happy gaming!!!"
2,Weak!,"I had the game for a week. I hit one base hit and everything else was a strikeout or a home run. Who wants to play a baseball game where every at bat is a strike out then you win with a couple of home runs?? There's little real baseball ""play"" in this game. Graphics are truly amazing but on the XBox360 the game stutters quite often. I took it back to the store."
4,Great for spiritual formation,"Wonderful guide to christian spiritual maturity. Each chapter includes reflection questions to guide one's thinking and to help apply the insights the author gives.The book is in 3 parts: Vocation, which talks about the movement from child to disciple to steward; virtue, which talks about the new virtues of power, intimacy, and imagination; and a third section called ""power and intimacy"" which explores the virtues more deeply in regards to strength, obedience, and a somewhat out-of-place section on women and men in the church, but which is kind of the ""power and intimacy"" in practical action."
3,Bell chain too short for adult bikes.,"This chain supposedly fits 1-3 speed bikes. However, it is too short for my adult-sized 1-speed Schwinn cruiser. I had to buy a second one and splice them together."
1,Deceptive Manufacturers Desription,"I bought this since it was advertised by the manufacturer to be for 1-3 speed bicycles. However, upon open opening this product, I found that the chain didn't fit my 1-speed bike because it was 7-8 links short of meeting the manufacturer's desription of how it should fit. Never buying Bell products again EVER!"
3,Too Short by far for 1991 Murray cruiser adult women's bike,I bought this at Wal-Mart to replace the old chain on my old 1991 Murray Cruiser adult-sized women's bike. I'm guessing this is a standard size for single-speed but it was too short. I also bought a chain for this same bike at LBS (local bike shop) KMC brand and it was too short too. I went to Wal-Mart thinking I could just grab something quick and cheap instead of going back to LBS but apparently it's just my bike and other bikes too based on the number of reviews saying this chain is too short. I give it 3 star because it works fine (I'm sure but couldn't try because doesn't fit) it was cheap and packaged fine.
1,Too short!,"I too found this chain too short for a standard single speed cruiser bike. Very aggravating that they could not even provide enough links for a full size bike. Needed 52"", this one is 48"". All chains offered should have the length listed to prevent this problem."
3,Good western for one of Robbie's first films,Although the VHS print was kind of hazy this was a good film for one of Robbie's first films. The plot was good and the acting was great. Too bad it is not on DVD. It is film hard to find but worth it when you find it if you are a Robbie Benson fan. The film is about a young boy growing up in the West after losing his father and joining a horse drive across the West. He develops into a fine young cowboy--the film is old but a pleasure to watch. Find it if you can.
3,i hate doing reviews,"its ok. it peeves me that the white paint on the stick wears off on my cymbels. they haven't broken yet, the balance is ok, the grip is fair (but not good) overall, it is OK."
1,not what picture shows,The picture shows white drum sticks--I received unfinished-brown sticks..I could've carved these myself froma tree limb.mis-advertised
4,"Good Sticks, Good Drummer","Travis Barker, drummer for Blink-182, Box Car Racer, and Transplants is an awesome drummer and these drumsticks live up to his name. The tip is unigue and the stick has great performance only the white paint tends to get on your drumset sometimes and the Travis Barker and Zildjian logos fade. Still, these are great and not too expensive!"
3,didn't last,I thought these would be better quality. My son is 15 and has been playing drums for a few years now. These sticks didn't last but a few months before they started looking like they had been used for years.
3,"Good, good, good, but bad.","I like the balance and the weight in these sticks for sure. The bead tip is sweet for rebound and they last a decently long time. I'd use this stick for all my general playing, but the paint-coming-off-on-the-cymbals issue is enough for me to stop using these."
4,Good Item,Purchased these for my son who is started to take Drum lessons (his 2nd instrument). He loves the color and has had to share them with his classmates so they can play with them!
4,drumsticks,"They are cheap, you beat on things, they make noise. I'm no Neil Peart so I may not know all the drumstick nuances, but they're fine and kids think that they look neat. whaddaya gonna do?"
2,Cute lamp but.....,"The lamp is very cute but the base has three different sections that were all loose, trying to twist it into place only seemed to wind the cord inside up so when you let go it just unwinds. Sadly sending it back hopefully to get a full refund."
4,"freaky,freaky banjo","God bless Eddie Adcock. This album shows you places you never thought possible on the banjo. People talk about Reno as an antidote to Scruggs style , but Adcock is REALLY out there. I didn't learn one song on this album because noone plays his songs where I live , but I LOVE watching this. It's a great dvd for a banjo nut to watch late at night. WOW , he is something else. When they made Eddie Adcock they broke the mold."
2,Banjo with Eddie Adcock,Must be a good player to understand what he is doing. Not good for beginers.
4,folding knife,"really pleased with knife, came with nice case, might need a little fitting on blade lock, but used it recently filleting several salmon, came very sharp, lost my old norway locking fillet knife and replaced it with this, I bought two, I might buy more for gifts, pretty good quality for being made in china."
5,get this,"very informative book, , it helps if you are a born-again bible-believer to really grasp everything that is covered here."
2,Good for a few laughs but not much else,"Well Texe Marrs was never a major player in the fundamentalist whacko circles. He was always overshadowed by Jack T. Chick. Still this book has some silly bits like blaming Rainbow Brite (Bright?) for children coming to Satan and Saturday morning cartoons for your kid carving up the neighborhood cats. Of course, I love the Bible as evidenced by my editing of the bookShe Nailed a Stake Through His Head: Tales of Biblical Terrorbut you have to read it with your brain and not just the kneejerk reactions."
3,Recommended Pre-Requisite: Being a Christian.,"If your a fundamentalist Christian or Evangelical this is the book for you. This book will speak volumes to your soul.This book is ultimatley, all true. There are many New Age leaders and groups, they have agenda's and beliefs, and they are advancing and shaping our culture and world. Even some of the new age leader do hate relligion to the point of trying to destroy it (even if by violence) And Christians do (should) believe everything this book says.However, Whether or not Christianity is real, or if the New Age is going to end up taking over the world and everyones going to become a demi-god...Is up to the reader.For the non believer, this book is an interesting and factual read into the beliefs and conflict between two relligious groups if taken into a non personal context.So befor for ordering, you better ask yourself...How's your faith?"
1,"Funny, untrue, and filled with fear","I read this off of my shelves that my parents bought a while ago, it was hillarious. I was a Christian, then became a New Ager (long story). I can assure you that we will NOT burn anyone, or start any wars. We learn to harness our sixth sense, and increase our awareness until we can ascend and join with the God force. Total unification is what we want, with peace, love, and joy. We are not harming anyone, we only wish to find answers before we die. If you actually believe Texe's misinterpretations, then go on living afraid of us if you want, it's your life."
3,Mixed bag,"This accordion met some criteria - weight was low for the number of keys, the number of keys and buttons was in the range desired (> 29), but it is disappointing in some aspects for the price. There is a lack of features that I have seen in some older (albeit heavier) accordions, the adjustment for the wrist strap is poor, the lining in the case has starting coming apart. Perhaps I should have looked longer for another accordion, but it is difficult to find the low weight and a decent accordion. This one is okay, but it is nothing special."
2,Not Technical Enough,"This book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from Computer Telephony magazine, without much editing or organization. It lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information, e.g., its index is essentially a word occurance listing."
2,no,"noThis is one guy who can make my head spin like only a handful of musicians ever did, but not here.This to me sounds like a jam session, nothing more. He is repetitive, playing licks instead of letting his heart go -just so you understand what i mean, listen to the track 'Don't blame me' on 'Eastern Sounds':Don't Blame MeOn 'The Man with the big Frontyard' i feel some basic things are missing, like imagination and intuition (Lateef and the piano player are not connected at all). If i could, i'd give this one back."
2,Too painfully slow to maintain interest,"I've listened to many a language tape for several languages, and while I've never adored any of them, this one is just too painful to listen to. The first few discs consist of a voice saying a phrase, then silence while you repeat, then another phrase, silence, then back to the old phrase, silence, etc. Lots of long pauses and repetition, which could be helpful for someone, but was completely unappealing and boring for me."
3,satisfied,I had to wait on my item but they were very good w getting it to me after the mess up happened. Its a good cd so far.
2,Good Mob Book.....Bad Sinatra Biography,"If you were looking to read quite a bit about the Mob from the 1800's in Sicily up through the 1970's you are in for a treat.If you wanted to read a biography about Frank Sinatra go elsewhere.It is so clear that the authors of this book flatout dislike Sinatra and anyone involved with him. Everything is written with a side comment clearly expressing the authors' dislike of Sinatra, for example, about the Rat Pack ""Being Drunk and making cracks about being drunk, was supposed to be hilarious"" Clearly meaning the authors did not find it hilarious.This is what you should expect throughout the book, side comments clearly expressing the authors dislike of anything Sinatra.I'm not the type of person who needs to read gushing about someone I'm interested in but I expect nuetrality at the very least and not flatout hatred."
2,Tedious reading about mobs and Jack Daniels,"I was very disappointed in this, since I liked the guy's Marilyn Monroe biography. There's just too much about the mob and mob connections, and although this may have been very scandalous information about Sinatra 20-30 years ago, it is very ho-hum now. As a human being, there is hardly anything good about Frank Sinatra. His was a screwed up life of drinking, abusing people, using women like tissues, more drinking, more abusing, and playing concert dates. The recitation of all this doesn't fly off the page in any entertaining way. It was very much a book I could put down, and I did often, until I slogged my way to the huge section of references and bookmarks at the end."
2,Nothing new here - Same old inuendo,"Chapter after chapter of the same old organized crime rumor. Who cares? What about the music? One chapter covers the entire Capitol years. The Sinatra/Riddle collaborations rates a couple paragraphs. The mafia connections are retread stories from thirty years ago. The definitive Sinatra biography remains 'Sinatra! The Song is You' by Will Friedwald. The subtitle says it all: ""A Singer's Art""."
2,"drinking, sex and the mob, not enough about the art","Summers dwells on and on about Sinatra's drinking, his women, his mob ties and his meanness. All very interesting, much of it new and revealing. One is left with a bitter, smarmy confusion about this icon of the American music scene. John Lahr once wrote a splendid piece about Sinatra's artistry of the singer in the New Yorker. Summers spends little space on the artistry of the singer and the significant contributions of Nelson Riddle. One wonders why not complete the portrait of Sinatra more than Summers did. the book would have been far more fulfilling."
4,Interesting,"Sinatra: The Life is an honest, intimate portrait of the man, the legend, Sinatra. Although it does get a little tasking tryin to read some of the slower passages, the book as a whole is definitely a worthwhile read, especially if Sinatra's exploits are intriguing to you.I would recommend it to anyone, especially Sinatra fans."
3,Good Biography But Not Anything New,"Advanced stories on Anthony Summer's biography of Frank Sinatra trumpeted the revelations about Sinatra and the mob. Really? Frank Sinatra was connected to the mob? Amazing. Ho hum we knew that already. Summers brings very little new to that already widely perceived assertion.The book is well written and aptly chronicles one of the most fascinating, influential and talented human beings of the 20th century. But the reader will find very little that hasn't been written before.Its all here--the rough and tumble beginnings, the hot headed Italian, the benevolent humanitarian, the womanizer and the raw talent. But if you are looking for something that hasn't been written before you will be left wanting."
1,The Age of Sinatra,"We know Frank Sinatra - we don't know Summers and wife.""They buried a man in California on May 14, 1998, but they didn't bury Frank Sinatra. Rock 'n' roll couldn't bury him, disco and rap couldn't. Elvis and the Beatles couldn't."" What makes you feel you can, Summers?"
2,Not as good as their Kauai book,"I am so disappointed. We bought this book (1 copy for us and 5 for family members) just before moving to the Big Island last month, because of how great the Doughty and Friedman Ultimate Kauai book was. After arriving here, we put it to use. It sure is lacking good places to eat and beaches, and is very negative. Perhaps my expectations were set too high by the fabulous Kauai book, or perhaps the authors couldn't expend the same effort as they did on the Kauai one. Looks like they ran out of steam. I will hunt for another, better book on the Big Island. Hope their new Maui Revealed isn't even worse."
2,"Without a doubt, the best!","After our visit to the Big Island in Jan '02, we planned another trip for Apr '02. Because we felt we had missed a lot, we searched Amazon for guide books and found ""Hawaii, The Big Island Revealed"" by Doughty & Friedman. It was amazing!Just to begin with, one of their suggestions about where to buy gas paid for the book! Twice!!A lot of their comments confirmed our feelings from the first trip so we knew they had great insight. After that, as we toured and decided on places to eat, places to visit, we used their guide and they never failed us! While driving down Hiway 11 and WE would look up places in the book to see what they said. It was a lot more than a guide book on shops and dining, but a guide to knowledge about the island and its hidden secret spots.I can recommend this book for even the most knowledgeable locals! I know you will enjoy it!!"
5,Saved our trip!!,"This book is excellent! You can't possibly get lost with this book in the car, the directions are perfect. We didn't want to spend all our time at the usual tourist locations, and this book lead us right to some of the smaller, less-travelled things that we really hoped to see. The directions were easy to follow and very acurate! Without it, we would have never found the bonsai garden that we wanted to see. We wouldn't have seen a lot of things that we did, if we hadn't had this book. I even left Montana, and left this book behind. I cried on the plane when I realized what I had done. Luckily, I was able to find one for sale in Kona. (at Walmart!) What a relief!! Don't go to Hawaii without this book!"
5,Da Kine Guide Book,"I purchased this book after looking through several at a bookstore, and I could not have been more pleased. The attention to detail is IMPECCABLE. I rarely had the book out of my hands when we were driving around the island. I've traveled to and lived in Hawaii, and this series of books by Doughty and Friedman are the best references you'll find. Their honesty regarding the hotels and restaurants is uncommon for travel guides, but should be the standard to which others aspire. I'm planning a trip to Kauai this year, and look forward to reading their insights. Do not travel to any of the islands without this book -- even if you think you've seen it all."
4,Needs to be updated,"Great book, but needs to be updated. There are many new establishments and activities he hasn't covered."
5,Good Stuff,"I have been to the ""Big Island"" twice and I can't believe how much I missed. If I am fortunate enough to return there some day, I will have this book with me at all times. The attention to detail was excellent, especially using the mile marker system to let people know exactly how to get somewhere. Descriptions were so clear, it was easy to visualize how something must look.I can't wait to go back and take this book with me."
5,Best Guide to the Big Island,"The first time we visited the Big Island we brought the book along but didn't use it. Big Mistake! It's filled with out of the way sights that are incredible to behold. When I did get around to reading it, I read it like a novel. We've used it four times since and have swum in little known volcanically heated pools and 'sauna-ed' in natural caves. It's easy to follow and full of wonderful descriptions. If you're looking for hidden Hawaiian treasures-- Get this book!"
5,What were expecting....,"I'm not sure what the people were expecting when they bought this book of BLESSINGS, yes blessings. This collection of blessings, meditations, poetry or whatever gives a different view that may reach one of our borderline lost Jews. This may be a little off the orthodox or conservative mark but it does reach the many of us that are looking for just something else besides the same old Amida, said twice. I am a male that goes to Minyan (daily services) and wraps teffilin daily. I do not have a problem bringing a little 60's or 70's views into today's praying. ""The Lord spoke to Moses saying""... when you look upon the fringes, well maybe this book will save one of our children from those other groups looking to convert them."
5,11+ years and still going strong,"After all these years, no dead pixels. It's a little bit dimmer now and the speakers are a bit buzzy sometimes. The base is very adjustable and tall-ish."
1,Unconvinced.,"This little book purports to provide the reader with a timetable or schedule upon which to base every major decision in their lives. For only a little more money, you can accessorize with a handy-dandy gold coin with tables from the book on either side. Taken together, you never have to think for yourself again!Oh, and, by the way... According to Lewis' system, 9:00 AM on Tuesday, September 11, 2001, was suitable time for initiating new travel plans or making new financial investments.Lewis wrote some interesting books, but stay away from this turkey!"
4,GREAT Tool for Rosicrucians and Others,"I bought the book and the coin and booklet from the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC (of which I am a member) bookstore. I didn't understand the wheel of life so much as I do know from reading it and utilizing the tools within the system. I understand a lot more how to use the yearly cycles from using this system so that I flow with the various tides now rather than feeling like I must swim against the flow, so to speak. A must have for Rosicrucians and truly beneficial to anyone who wants to make life itself run more efficiently."
5,great work,I just started using the methods in this book and even experimented with the unfortunate periods and found them to be difficult to say the least. I truly believe in life cycles.
2,missing information,I would love to review this book because it started with intriguing premises about how it's possible to create something positive out of chaos..too bad I'm missing pages 40-55...page 56 is printed on the back of page 39.This was a gift from a loving friend...before I reorder one of my own I'd like to think there are complete copies available from amazon.
5,THIS IS MY GUIDE FOR MAKING DECISIONS!!!!!,"This rare book is the best guide for make my personal, financial and business decisions 4 years ago. I would like to haVe this excellent book before because I am sure that with it's help I made better choices. Anyway If you want to escape from the affairs of the ""luck"", study this book and you will find that ""there is a correct time for each thing""......It works!!!!!! How do you feel, and how are your things into the last month before your Birthday??? I am sure that the answer is not very optimistic,....but it can be fixed, look into the book why. T his book contains cycles for your business, health, and much more. it is an simple and easy way to go safe by the life.Some of things I will leave for my son when I go away from this world it this book."
5,Innovative and Engaging,"Nearly 10 years old now, the IJAM is one of the leading scholarly journals in arts management. Each issue brings a new selection of essays on marketing, leadership, fundraising, programming and other topics relecant to arts organizations. There also is generally a profile of a specific arts organization or festival, giving a sense of realism to the other more academic essays. Articles are written by experts and are well-edited and documented. Layout is clean, with numerous bi-lingual articles (generally French and English, reflecting the location of the editorial office in Montreal). A good place to follow developments in arts organizations and to pick up some cues for 'best practices.'"
2,Ok,The pellets are cheap and won't fire out of my gun and just bend overall a horrible pellet would not consider buying again.
1,BaaaaaaaaaaaD do NOT buy,"the can does not open , a car mechanic could not open it either using his strong hands,tools needed, inside what a disaster they are crocked bended pellets i do say almost 40 percentare bad the tip do not belive the picture does not look this pointydo not buy not even the 500 for a dollarthe CAN stuck again i will return or better place it in garbage"
1,too big for .177 phantom,i bought this thinking it would fit my Crosman Phantom 1000this product does not fit the gun.....waste of time and money.the pellets are too big.....
4,Book_Happy,This book was the best thing when it came to learning about Turf management because it is easy to follow. A lot of books out there are not so easy to follow and this one was very easy. The book tells you how much you need to use to water your lawn successfully and not over do it. It tells you what kind of Pesticides you should use on what plants. And best of all you learn Which grasses are which. So I am very happy that this book existed and hope that all of you enjoy it too.
1,Turfgrass,"I cannot give this book a good review as it has not been received as yet. Was it sent? If so, has it been returned? We really need to have this book. If it has been returned, please try to send it again."
3,"Tries to be deep, but is it?","The meaning or underlying effect that this show is supposed to have is... not noticeable from this CD. The synopsis doesn't seem to help either. However how many of us listen to a CD for that? Some of the songs on this CD are great. And of course Ben Vereen is wonderful. The music doesn't sound old, its jazzy and clubby, not following traditional Broadway, but going more into a vaudevillian-night-club sound. I didn't get bored listening to this CD, however I found myself wondering what was going on. Have I convinced you one way or the other about purchasing this? No, and the CD will leave you the same way. Feeling only partially satisfied. I would suggest this for Ben Vereen fans, burlesque lovers, and of course the Broadway collectors. Newer listeners, probably wont want this one. People with an older taste (showboat), might not go for this either. Its a middle of the road CD and its hard to guess who will like it. Favorite Song: ""Katie, My Love"""
1,Cheap,This is a cheap fake katana! The only reason I bought it was because I paid like 5 bucks for it!
2,Not ready for prime time,"The singles just don't compare to his later work. A lot of the songs are in keys that don't work for the vocals. If Magic Sam's reputation had to stand on these recordings alone he'd be remembered as a journeman at best.If you're looking for your first Magic Sam recording get ""West Side Soul."""
5,A blues compilation done to perfection,"Cobra released a great cd here in The Essential Mahic Sam, covering his early recording(which are the only ones you really need). These songs from 1957 to the early 60's are awesome. Perfect msuic to play while cruisin' in your 57 Chevy. This music shows how closely related rockabilly and 50's rock'n'roll really were to urban blues, becaue you can hear a little Magic Sam style in Elvis' recordings of the period, and some of the backup bands on thsi cd sound similar to Gene Vincent's backup band The Blue Caps, and some of the palying here sounds like Bill Haley's backup group the Comets. In any case all the music here jumps and swings, and shuffles. And as far as dancers are concerned there are boppers, jivers, and plenty of strollers!!! Exellent comp."
4,Very Early Magic Sam,"This CD features Magic Sam with his earliest recordings but not raw at all. Magic Sam always seems to be in fine voice and guitar playing. His debut single ""All Your Love"" is featured here along with a cut he did with the late great Earl Hooker.The Cobra and Chief were small recording labels based in Chicago, although not as famous as Chess Records they both played an important part in the history of recorded Chicago blues. This CD is a remastered version of an earlier release too.These recordings find Magic Sam produced and backed by the great Willie Dixon on bass (Dixon had a falling out with the Chess Brothers and moved across town for awhile).I wouldn't call this an essental set but one to have after you've listened to Magic Sam's ""West Side Soul"" or ""Magic Sam Live"" CDs."
3,THREE AND A HALF STARS,"THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL MAGIC SAM RECORDINGS FROM THE SHORT-LIVED CHICAGO BASED COBRA LABEL IN THE LATE 50'S. I HAVE READ SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS HERE AND I HAD TO LAUGH. ONE SAID THAT HIS LATER RECORDINGS WERE BETTER, AND SOMEONE ELSE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS SINGING. THOSE ARE BOTH BOGUS REMARKS, AS HIS LATER STUFF (ON THE DELMARK LABEL) ISN'T QUITE AS GOOD AS THESE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS, AND HIS SINGING SHOULDN'T EVEN BE A CONSIDERATION, SINCE YOU ARE BUYING THE CD TO HEAR HIS GUITAR PLAYING, WHICH IS GREAT (ALTHOUGH SOME SONGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER ONES). HE OPTIMIZED THE USE AND APPLICATION OF ELECTRIC GUITAR FOR HIS TIME, AND THAT IS WHY YOU BUY THE DAMN RECORD, NOT HIS SINGING!"
4,Quick to the point with clearly indexed proficiency areas,"Sams offers another well-researched how-to book for Lotus Notes and true to its title, people using it will teach themselves Notes 4.6 in 24 hours of reading and doing. I used the book to teach 30 other Notes newbies how to use the program to enhance their productivity. The book has found a new home now -- ""borrowed"" by a sales consultant who packed it as part of his notebook and telephone cables."
4,Science Fair Project Kit - Petri dishes,"Everything about this order went very smoothly. The only criticism I have is that the instructions on how to prepare the agar should be clearer. Our daughter used hot water as the method for liquifying the agar. It took forever to accomplish. It took well over 45 minutes, trying varying water temperatures, to liquify and then it wasn't totally in the state it should have been. This is a difficult material to deal with. Otherwise, the purchase process was a breeze."
4,"Good Kit, Includes Everything Needed - Recommended","This kit contains enough supplies to make 20 Petri Dishes for growing bacteria.The instructions are well written and easy to follow. We were able to get very good results (my daughter won her division :-)One note on the Agar, be sure to only fill the Petri dishes to the fine line on the inside as there is *JUST* enough Agar to fill the 20 dishes.This kit is a fairly good value and contains high quality materials.Recommended!"
1,The solution blew up my microwave!!,"UGH! This product looked easy enough to use and we needed a lot of petri dishes, so I thought this was the best buy. I put the solution in my microwave for 2 minutes (the directions said 2-5 so I was being cautious). About a minute and a half later we heard a huge explosion and my microwave was dead. My microwave door is now jammed closed from the explosion and it is completely broken! I HIGHLY caution anyone from using this product."
1,smells,it smelledhorrible and it didnt work even though i followed directions i hate it and dont recommend it
5,Excellent,It arrived quickly and everything was packaged neatly. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. All the essentials are in there. I'm ordering another one right now for this year's science fair. A++
3,Slightly disappointed,"I purchased this kit for my son's science fair project. Admittedly, I am not a scientist, but I was 95% sure we followed the enclosed directions in preparing the auger. Unfortunately we did not get good results at all. So I'm not sure if this was b/c of the auger, the preparation, or the experiment itself. On the other hand, I thought the directions in auger preparation were clear and concise, the packaging was good and the product was good. We just didn't get the results we needed for a good science fair project, luckily we had a backup."
4,great product for science fair,"We ordered 2 of these kits for my 8th grade daughter's science fair project. The kits arrived in great shape with all components. After reading the previous reviews, and taking the advice to heat the agar SLOWLY, loosen cap, etc - my daughter poured the plates and got great results. There was no contamination in any of the plates or in her negative control of her experiment. Although a bit pricey, a really good product to introduce kids to microbiology"
5,Read the instructions,"This worked great for my 5th graders science project. Make sure you read through the instructions. It clearly says to open the lid to the agar a little and to microwave it at half power in 30 second intervals.Do check your science fair rules (we apparently didn't) as my son's fair prohibited growing cultures at home. So while he received great scores at his school fair and passed the course requirements, his project wasn't allowed to advance to the district fair.Here's an idea, let's all lament and complain that children aren't interested in science and then make asinine science fair rules about growing cultures of bacteria collected from freshly washed hands at home. Brilliant!!!"
4,Science project in a box,Project still in progress. Easy instructions and great guide to the scientific method cam along with it. Great package for a kids preoject.
4,Sweet Swing,We loved it. KInda out growed it fast but it was wonderful.. He would swing for hours at a time and the different speeds were great. Great for a boy or girl because it was neutral and it reclines as well as sits upright.
1,Hated this swing,We bought this because it matched the bassinet and high chair. First of all you cannot turn the music off- you have to wait until it is done. Also you cannot adjust the volume. It swings so fast I was afraid to put my son in it while it was on. I returned this and got the Fisher Price Papasan cradle swing. My son loves that one. Don't waste your money on the Eddie Bauer swing.
1,looks good but...,I liked the look of this swing a lot. i set it up before i had my baby. after my baby was born one day i decided to put her in the swing. after about 1 minute in the swing she started crying. when i went to get her out the STRAP WAS STUCK! i couldnt get her out! this made her really cry! when we finally got her out we never put her back into it and brought it back to babies r us assembled. i would not recomend this product.
5,Love It!,"After reading several negative reviews here, I was a little hesitant about purchasing this but I did and I do not regret it!I read in a lot of reviews that the swing was too fast. Not true. I put my son in it for the first time when he was 1 week old and he was frightened at all, in fact he fell asleep RIGHT away, I mean, as soon as I pushed the button to start it. He sleeps in it often, sometimes it's the only thing other than me that soothes him. (He's now almost a month old)The only negative I've found has been the music. Not the music itself just the duration. If you turn it on, you have to endure it for 15 minutes as there is no way to turn it off. So far we haven't exactly needed it anyways so we just don't use it.I love this swing and so does my son. If it weren't for it, ther would be times I wouldn't get any housework done!"
2,I agree with the other MOMS!!,"I wish I had read the reviews first. Beautiful, yes. Functionable, no! There is not much difference between speeds, almost seems too fast for a 2-3 month old on the lowest setting. The music, can't shut it off when you shut the swing off, have to wait for it to finsh on it's own, 15 minutes or so. In retrospect, I wish it had volume control as well, a little too loud at times. Won't get much use out of this product."
1,Really nice swing but horrible!,"This is a really nice wooden swing but when it comes to the music it's horrible. You can't hear a thing. Also, once the music is turned on there's no way of turning it off. My daughter hates this swing. She loves the aquarium swing better."
4,Wonderful Swing,"This swing is exactly as I expected... the sounds are nice, especailly the nature sounds. Was very easy to put together and fits perfectly in with our natural wood with dream teddy them. This swing is beautiful, but I don't think this swing is worth as much at $130.00.... that other 6 speed one suggested on another reviwe looks like it doe sthe same thing and is just as cute. I guess it is the fact that you are paying for the wood on this swing?? Overall... great swing!"
2,Like an amusement ride,"This swing looks nice and is very well constructed. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, even at the slowest setting, it swings ridiculously fast. Our 2 month old son was throwing his arms up scared with each swing! My wife and I say its like the swinging pirate ship ride at amusement parks. Maybe as the batteries wear down or your child grows and weighs more it might be OK. I'd recommend getting one of the smaller travel swings at first. They swing a little slower and take up a lot less room."
1,Too fast,"This thing just moves way too fast, even on the slowest speed. We're going to see if we can return it."
1,"Beautiful swing - yes. Useful, no.","I loved the look of this swing, and the seat seems comfortable to the touch, but my daughter hates it. And the swing mechanism skips around to the different speeds even when you aren't changing them. I also had trouble getting the tray on and off, and the buckles on the safety strap were difficult to get off once she was in the seat. She would scream to get out, and I had to struggle to get the safety belt off. I wouldn't recommend buying this swing."
1,I HATE this swing!,"The speeds are horrible, even though it has 5, none seem to be the ""right"" one. The music is hard to turn off and just annoying. It doesn't have enough color/lights to entertain an awake baby, so we only use ours when she's sleeping. We've used it for about 5 weeks and now the swinging portion isn't working at all!"
2,Baby hated it!,"We bought this swing because it was beautiful and classy. Big mistake! Babies dont care if something is classy, they want something colorful and contrasting! We put our daughter in this several times and everytime she started crying (it swings really fast!). We returned it and got the Baby Einstein one and she loves it! The colors are bright and it's much more entertaining for her!"
1,"Poor quality, poor design","I too was impressed by the looks of this swing. However, once I got one, things were not as well. First, we had to return the first swing we received because one of the housings for the hanging arms of the swing was misaligned so we could not complete assembly. The second set had the same problem, but was able to fix it with a tap of a hammer (should this have to happen with a brand new product???).Then we ran into the problem one of the reviewers mentioned. The music cannot be turned off! You press the button once and music starts. Your press the button twice, sounds come off. But the music will not stop. You have to wait 15 mins for the concert to end! Anybody's heard of an off button at EB's? So, keep a screw driver handy so that you can turn off the music by removing the batteries. I'm scratching Eddie Bauer from my list of baby product suppliers..."
1,Disappointed Mom,"After waiting for 3 months, we finally laid down the cash to buy this cute swing. I was so excited, until my husband finished putting it together. Like so many other parents, we bought it for the wood look, which looks so nice in our wood floor living room. Also, I liked the fabric, which is perfect for both boys and girls. But we can't stand it!!The motor is SO NOISY, it just grinds and grinds. The music is loud and doesn't turn off without removing the batteries. There seems to be no difference between the 5 speeds and the lowest speed is quite fast, although my son doesn't seem to mind.After much anticipation, we have decided to return it and buy one of those bright colored plastic things."
1,Diappointed,I registered for the Eddie Bauer Swing along with other Eddie Bauer items. I loved the look of the wood because it matched my wood floor. After using it for several weeks it stopped swinging. After changing the batteries it was obvious the swing was broken. Babies R Us was kind enough to exchange it but the same thing happened to the 2nd Eddie Bauer Swing. It was such a disappointment because it looked so perfect in my living room and now I'm stuck with a broken swing. I am also going to contact the manufactuer.
1,TERRIBLE!,"We bought this swing mostly for the looks knowing it would be parked in our family room, however I totally regret that. There is no difference between speeds 1 - 5 and ours goes super fast when our son is not in it and is so slow its not even like its swinging when he is in it. He's a big boy - 15.5 lbs at 9 weeks, but it has been like this since he was a newborn. Go with performance and not looks for this piece of equipment!"
2,Bulky and Awkward,"I hated this swing, its heavy and awkward and not easily to move if you plan on using it in multiple rooms. It does look nice but thats about it. I ended up selling mine after using it once."
1,good swing till the motor quits on you,"My son is almost 15 weeks now. He loves the swing and we use it on the highest speed since we start him in it. The motor just failed on us. I would not buy this swing again. The straps are to hard to use and aren't removable for cleaning. We don't use the straps. It is bulky to take with you. The tray is ok. Nice looking but it needs to work. Shoddy workmanship on the motor.The music stops if you hold the button in, just like the swing button. If anyone knows how to get a hold of the manufactuer, please post it.Dave"
1,Awful!,"This swing is not worth the money. My husband put it together so regarding ease to assemble it took him over an hour. The music was blaring and there is not a volume control. Also, the music keeps going and going and going. You can't turn it off. After five minutes I started getting a headache and I was in a different room.Another not so great thing about the swing is the slowest swinging option is really really fast. We put weight in the basket thinking that might slow it down...Yeah, not really. The poor baby that gets put into this will be flung to and fro and will probably have poor hearing from the LOUD music. Trust me....skip it. Not worth the cuteness of it being wood with the Eddie Bauer name. Yikes!"
1,Lasted only 11 weeks,"My son loved this swing for 11 weeks, until the motor died. It is completely out of commission and we are returning it for a new brand. The tray is difficult to open and close, but easier to use if left closed. It took me 9 weeks to figure out that you can shut the music off by holding the music button down for a few seconds. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this swing."
4,my son loves this swing,"I agree with some of the bad reviews on this item, but for the most part this swing is great. The belt on the swing is really difficult to deal with, especially if you have a crying baby that you are trying to get OUT of the thing. I learned though that you have to clasp both sides of the belt, and that makes un-clipping the belt much much easier. It can be very frustrating. The motor is kind of loud for a baby swing, but it is actually what puts my son to sleep most of the time, not the music. We have never had a problem with the motor. The music on this this is pretty annoying for my husband and myself, but the few times that we did turn it on my son did like it. My husband and I also have the high chair and baby bouncer that match the swing. It is a really good looking set. Bad things aside, I LOVE this swing."
2,Not my genre,"This is one of the reasons why I do not like to read books that are written successively by many authors. Unfortunately for the the genre is one that I do not often read so you may want to consider this. The bigger objection I have is the jerking you get from reading one author and then the next. Sorry, but this does not do it for me.J. Robert Ewbank"
4,A different Perspective..,"Most of the historical symbols, Nazis, NSDAP and uncountable others has its roots on MU civilizaton. At least that's what Author concludes from his and Niven's research on Mexico and India. I recommend it's a must for any serious occult or paranormal researcher..."
2,Ancient book about ancient symbols fun but useless,"This book was written in the 30's and, although extremely interesting as a piece of fiction, it is completely ineffective as historical fact. Interesting, but completely irrelevant. Most of the authors conclusions regarding the origins of the worlds religions seem ludicrous. The author speaks of Atlantis as if it were Iowa. Sorry, but there has never been conclusive proof of it's existence. Still, a fun book."
4,Kept me goin'!,"Very intriguing book. I wanted to keep reading it constantly to see what happened with the main characters. Very easy read, with a good story-line."
4,Hats off Ms Pietropaoli!!!,Ms Pietropaoli helps to restore the meaning of friendship. Friendship that over the years has lost its meaning. Then by including a suspenseful storyline only enhances its value. Rainy's character is true to her own character. Hats off Ms Pietropaoli!!! Cant Wait for the next book.
4,BEAUTIFUL.....,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this the first time around--these guys are amazingly gorgeous. On my second viewing, i found myself still unable to take my eyes off of them. These men are hypnotic! Mesmerizing... it's simply a great viewing pleasure, if nothing else!"
2,A CD YOU CAN PASS BY,"Sorry, but this CD lacks too many hits to be called BOBBY'S BIGGEST HITS. Could it be called such when it does NOT contain one of his biggest hits: VOLARE? Among the other missing are THE CHA CHA CHA,GEE IT'S WONDERFUL,THE DOOR TO PARADISE,THE BEST MAN CRIED,I'LL NEVER DANCE AGAIN and DON'T BE AFRAID(to fall in love). Also it would have been nice to have added JINGLE BELL ROCK when he and Chubby Checker teamed to recreate the 2nd time Christmas hit on this song. Anyway, maybe someone will do this collection right some day-until then..............."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about Tolkien and then some,"Like the title of my review says, this set has everything you ever wanted to know about Tolkien and then some. At around 2300 pages, this isn't exactly casual reading, and it isn't for the casual reader either - it is for the devoted Tolkien fan.Devoted Tolkien fans will be rewarded for their patience as they work their way through these thick volumes. Plenty of rare nuggets and interesting commentary on the life and times of Tolkien."
5,"Well, it is finally out","After long wait and anticipation, the Companion and Guide Box Set is out.I reviewed the two volumes separately. I think that those books are the most important Tolkien's scholarship books since H.o.M.E. Vol. 12.Is J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide suitable for all? the answer is no. vol. 2 will be more appealing for the ""average Tolkien enthusiastic"" and Vol.1 will be of much interest and importance for serious Tolkien scholar.The box set is very impressive and convenient, But make sure that you want both books before buying it."
5,This book is amazing,I think that this book is really useful if you have to study Tolkien in depth because it gives you lots of information about his life and creative works. I love it.
2,Overorchestrated,"As a longtime R.R.Kirk listener and fan, this was a big disappointment to me. I had never heard of any of the four albums on this reissue, and there's a good reason. Kirk worked best in small groups; heck, he WAS a group. Most of the material here is overorchestrated, in an embarrassingly dated way. There's good stuff here, but you have to pick through a lot of mediocre-to-bad material. If you're looking for bargains, get ""Dog Years in the Fourth Ring""."
4,No bull,"This is a superbly scripted and acted tv miniseries. It has the feel of a movie, with high production values. The main character, former bull fighter Juncal, is an inveterate bs artist and philanderer. But he has some integrity. The shows have delightful humor and occasional social satire. The scenery in Valencia and Cordoba is first rate, both interior and exterior."
1,Smart Comedy???,"I've decided the term ""smart comedy"" is used to describe a movie that just doesn't have alot of substance or funny and somehow was lucky enough to be made"
2,Where The F Is The Sex Jokes?,"I got this movie because of John C Reilly and Seann Williams Scott. Crazy disappointed. Youd expect hilarious, yet wildly inappropiate humor from Dale Dobak and Stifler. Probably would have been an OK movie if i would have read the description and expected a REAL movie. but the whole time I couldnt stop thinking about American Pie and Step Brothers.... dont expect crazy unbelievable jokes. actually had a good point."
4,The Office meets The Supermarket,"Small details set this human comedy apart: the thick glasses on the nerdy manager, the yearning looks on the young male lead, the set of board members who never say anything except for the chairman who treats the promotion of his next manager as if it were to lead the world, not a ghetto grocery. John C. Reilly is great as the clueless Canadian. The dialogue is pretty pitch perfect. I can't fault this."
3,"LOW KEY COMEDY, NEVER REACHES GREATNESS! 2 1/2 STARS!","I am usually a fan of these little films that pop up from nowhere, but 'The Promotion' while mildly entertaining, lacks the insight and interest level of many films of this nature. it's not a bad film, but I expected more from it. It just kind of sits there and that's never a good thing. It's worth a look for viewers who like small films, but I wouldn't buy this one!"
1,Horrible Movie,We had never heard of the movie but the two guys are usually funny. I bought it and when it got here we put it in at the fire station. We were just wanting to relax and watch a movie that would make us laugh. There were a couple humorous parts but that is about all I can say for this movie. Most of the guys left and went to their rooms within the first 20 minutes. I actually watched the whole thing and decided by the end I should have left when everyone else did. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
4,saw it at the Jacksonville Film Fest,"I saw this piece at the Jacksonville Film Festival. I enjoyed the film, I thought it was cleverly written and before I noticed the review on the website, I thought they used the F-word very well. Then I went on their site and noticed the previews mentioned the same opinion, anyways, Seann William Scott is definitely not type cast and John C. Riley is an extremely talented focus actor. I enjoyed watching this in the theater and I will be renting it tonight!thanks,Nic Christie"
5,NEOPROGRESSIVE FIRST CLASS!!,"Excellent band! I already knew this CD before you buy it in amazon.All tracks are wonderful, perfect vocals and instrumentation.Without doubt, it is hard for an eternity!I recommend and I was very happy to have got the original copy.I loved! Wonderful!If they had more stars available, I completed..."
1,It just doesn't work!,"I have used it by keeping it plugged in all the time 24/7 and after over a month it has failed to catch even one fly. It is located in my kitchen where I kill a dozen flys each day with an old fashioned hand held flyswatter. So there are flys to be killed. I have a spider that lives at a corner of one kitchen window. He (I guess a male as there is no web built) He sits there and when a fly lands on the window he runs up and eats it. I can't recommend this ""Fly Killer"" product, but I would like to have more of these spiders. I counted more than 20 'fly remains' at his corner today.The device has killed maybe a dozen small (moth like) insects and perhaps 20 gnats. But no flys and it's the flys that are the real pesky insects. I might try baiting the trap with a fly bait. It's a glue trap, so I am confident that if they enter they will be trapped. So I will try to lure them in. If I find what works, I'll pass it on to the manufacturer as a hint."
5,Great little product,"Everyone in the office is extremely pleased with these openers. They may not be the fanciest thing around, but the price is right and they do the job they are designed for quite well."
3,It was average,"The book was okay. I couldn't finish it. It was too graphic, mainly towards the end of the book."
5,All that Glitters Ain't Gold,"A look into Dorian Moore's life affords us the opportunity to glimpse at family dysfunctions, lies, hatred and pain. Nevertheless you are not left feeling like ""In Search of Pretty Young Black Men"" was only an entree. For this avid reader it was the entree and the main course.I hear alot of reference to the term ""down low"" with regards to this book, which I do not understand. Is it possible that Dorian had a large apetite?? Heck Baskin Robbins has 32 flavors, it does not hurt to test drive them all.""Black Men"" was just what the doctor ordered short sweet and entertaining.I walked away from ""Black Men"" with the following thought Why are folks willing to die for someone who is not willing to die for them. Be yourself no MATTER who *YOU* are.What an unforgettable read! -Missy"
2,Wished It Was More,This was a pretty strange book. I felt as the other reader did who said it wasn't what he expected and hurried through it so he could give it away.. Very forgettable.
2,Not what I expected,Fooled me... not a great book.. I usually read a book of this size in 1 -2 days.... I'm pushing on two weeks.... just want to get through it and give it away.
1,"Poor writing, poor prose, dull, uneventful story","The author obviously tries TOO hard to write here. Too much icing, not enough cake. His descriptions are too redundant and become trite after three pages of the same thing. This might be his first book he has ever composed. I was sad, not about the storyline but about the authors style. I recommend you move on to other titles...."
1,What the F### is this???,"There are so many posibilities with the premise of this story but the writer just didn't take advantage of them. Too busy hurling shock phrases and filth. Luckily the book is only 163 pages. I'm at 124 and don't see the point in finishing. Female voices don't ring true at all. Too much ""piss elegance"" finger snapping and references to ""Ross"". There are so many mentions made of the diva I thought maybe she'd written this book. All of the female characters were without dimension. The only true voices were the interactions between Lamont and Dorian, but the scene was too short. Maybe the next book will be about male relationships of the heart and not the organ. The writer's style is dramatic and I was looking forward to a good story. I'm still looking for it."
1,Hot Wheels,What happened to hot wheels tracks? Does anyone else remember when you could buy a box with a whole bunch of track and connectors and create your own layouts?The sets available come with a paltry 2 or 3 yards of track and maybe a bunch of hard plastic pieces. Only a limited number of configurations are possible.
4,Laughter and Fun,I bought this toy for my son's third birthday. That night we set it up and he just loved it. We play with it together for about half an hour per day. He just loves testing his cars against one another. The biggest issue is that it is difficult to get two cars going at once. The other issue is that the track is very lightweight and moves a lot across the floor.But I must say that he loves the toy and has fun.
4,Beatrix Potter Biography,"I have always been interested in Beatrix Potter for several reasons. Growing up, I was pretty reclusive and with few friends but to become an accomplished author in a male dominated field, is amazing. Since she was so reclusive, it's very hard to find anything written about her personal life. This book details her life as much as possible but I found it very hard to get through. I had to attempt it several times. I feel the principle reasons are the writing style of the British author, Margaret Lane and the time, 1945- 1946, the book was written/published. I had to read it all at once in one afternoon. I feel it makes a good addition to my collection."
3,Beatrix Potter book,The book arrived on time and in good condition. The book didn't seem to be as interesting as I thought it would be.
2,meh...,"I am a huge Op Ivy fan, but this cd was pretty [...]. The music quality was poor and in fact, I had already had most of these songs. I'd spend a couple dollars on this, but no more."
2,I did not like it,"I was not feeling this album at all which is strange because I like Mac Dre and Dubee quite a bit. I was not feeling the tracks. It was too funk oriented, with some dumb sounding tracks. It was not the smooth type of production that I expected to hear coming out of Vallejo. A big disappointment."
2,"Good toy, but beware for younger children!","We bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter, who just love to make noise with anything. She also loves to stick things in her mouth because she's teething. One day, she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth. the metal from one of the bells cut her lip! We let her play with the other ones still, but the one with the bells is put away at least until she's older!"
5,happy shopper,"Seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical! My niece absolutely loved them. She had such an easy time handling them because they are her size, which is unusual. All other instrument toys are so much larger and it's hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them! The smiles and giggles are worth everything!"
2,a newspaper reporter's quicky,"Readers deserve better from an author than what Gina Kolata, who works for the NY Times, provides. She takes a reporter's easy way and substitutes a few interviews and personal details about current researchers for any depth of research into the history of the 1918 epidemic-- the purported subject of the book-- or the science involved. As intereesting as the subject is iherently, skip this one. You've got more important things to do with your time-- or you should."
3,Flu Review,"Gina Kolata's Flu presents a unique view of the search for the 1918 flu strain. She approaches the topic in a conversational tone, making a complex subject appeal to a lay audience. More specifically, in addition to describing the overall process of discovering the 1918 strain, she goes into great detail about some of the people involved, which humanizes the story. In particular, she sketches a very accurate portrayal of Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger and Dr. Johan Hultin. That being said, there are times at which she seems to dwell on somewhat trivial details, which are not necessarily interesting to the audience. In addition, I found the resolution somewhat lacking, not really providing closure to the all the questions the book raises. Overall, this was a moderately compelling book, bringing exciting and complicated science to a lay audience but not delivering as complete a story as it promised to."
2,Catchy title not related to book content.,"Not only were the survivors of the 1918 flu epidemic so traumatized that few would talk about it, apparently so was the author, Gina Kolata. This is an extremely well written book but other than the first chapter, it is not about the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic. I would look elsewhere for information on that subject."
3,Reasonably Good Narrative of a Dreadful Epidemic,I was drawn to this book by a detail mentioned in passing in a review about baseball players playing games all wearing masks during September 1918 because of the pandemic. Alas I did not see much development of this particular detail. I found the narrative was initially interesting but towards the end my interest waned as we read of various scientific squabbles re discovering the source of the epidemic.
2,Like a bad high school research paper...,"This book actually contains some information on the flu epidemic, but it is precious hard to sort out from all the totally irrelevant stuff. If you're interested in the interior decorating skills or love affairs of the scientists looking for the DNA of the 1918 flu virus, then by all means read this book. But if you want to know about the epidemic itself, there have *got* to be better sources of information. This book reads like a bad high school research paper-- a little actual information, and a whole lot of empty filler to meet the page requirement."
3,Good information but lack of delivery,"We were thinking that this book would be a similar read to ""The Great Influenza"" but came away somewhat disappointed. The information and research methods were fascinating and kept the attention of the reader, but it lacked a good storyline behind the events in 1918. Although this is not the top recommended pick by OUTFOX, it is a good read for students taking classes on communicable diseases. We recommend it also for upper level health classes but only when paired with an appropriate lesson on our modern day risks of an outbreak. This book is good to help get the reader prepared to see what he/she can do to help avoid outbreaks and work better in infection control (especially for infection preventionists).OUTFOXOUTFOXprevention.com"
