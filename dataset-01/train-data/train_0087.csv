5,ADD TO YOUR BEST OF LIVE ALBUMS COLLECTION,"good, solid musicianship... on SPACE TRUCKIN', Ian changes gears mid way through the song and the contrast in style actually sounds like two different drummers... this is 2nd copy I have, not including the original double album vinyl"
1,False description,"This chest, described as having ""real beadboard side panels"" has absolutely no beadboard on it whatsoever. It is a plain white chest, made entirely of melamine and particleboard.I complained about this to Stacks and Stacks and asked if I had received the wrong item and was told via email that ""Amazon forwarded a message from you to me, stating that you believe that you received an incorrect product. You have indeed received the correct item. The beadboard panels refer to the grooves that set a pattern on the panels, not actually beads. These beadboard panels are shown to you on the picture on line, with the grooves present.""Well, the description says beadboard, not ""grooves"", but, be that as it may, this chest doesn't even have ""grooves"" let alone real beadboard.So, not only is this item falsely advertised, they intend to brazen it out! Don't buy it!"
5,Extensions,"They are what they are. Merchandise was as described, delivery was prompt. What more could you ask for?"
1,uggg,"twisted off the end that goes into the socket on 2 out of the 3 bars. 3rd bar would do the same for sure, went and got a smaller (shorter) 3 bar set, same thing happened. tring 3/4 inch now to get that crank shaft bolt off. this was a waste of good money again."
1,Not Heavy Duty,"Unfortunately, this product cannot withstand high torque application. I was trying to remove crankshaft pulley bolt to replacetiming belt, but end where socket goes in got twisted. Seems like this extension wasn't designed to handletorque more than 150 ft/lbs. If you need long and heavy duty long extension, buy it from other brand. Connecting 3 shortair impact extensions gave me better result than this extension."
1,Junk!!,I own a Neiko breaker bar and it works great BUT these extensions are a different story!! I was trying to use these to take off a crankshaft pulley bolt and Broke two of the extensions like it was nothing. I am Very Disappointed with the product and its been just over 30 days so its not worth my time to fight over $5 after i pay for the shipping cost. I wish I would of read deeper into the reviews here and also wish Amazon would not Recommend these with the high torque Neiko bar since these extension are not in the same category! I would guess these extension bars broke around 800 ft/lbs. Do not waste your time with these even on semi-high torque applications!! If you want to loosen something finger tight with these you might be alright.
1,Break easily,"I expected these to be a great addition to my tools collection. Long extension bars in 1/2"" drive can be useful in many applications. I tried to use them to take off a crankshaft pulley bolt on my Honda. The first one snapped immediately. I looked at the surface and it looked like there was a bubble inside steel. Ok, perhaps it was defective. I tried another one. It was much stronger, and I thought I started to get that pesky bolt off, but the second extension bar broke. Just for the fun, I tried the third one, and sure enough it broke too. I am not super strong and did not apply too much force. Still needed to get that bolt off: went to a store, bought two 10"" extension bars for impact guns, put them together for a nice 20"" extension bar and got my bolt off, no problem. Sent the broken bars back to Amazon and got my money back. Don't buy these. Get impact extension bars instead, they are well worth the extra money."
2,Poor Quality,"I have only used the 30"" and it broke in the socket with very little force the first time I used it."
4,Fasrt shipper,FAst shipper but like others reviews the item was boxed about as poor as Ive ever seen. Item fell out of box at post office. Looked like a 10 year old taped it and boxed it. Same for other product I bought to go along with these extensions.
1,No science here,"Maybe it was a bad batch of yeast, but none of the experiments worked for my excited 5 year old nephew. It was a disappointment,"
1,Waste of Money,I have done 3 experiments from this kit so far and every single one was a flop. I even went to the store and bought new yeast because I thought maybe it was old but it didn't make any difference. I wish I could get my money back for this kit. It was a complete waste of time and money.
3,"OK, read the instructions carefully...","Admittedly, my review is tainted by the fact that I now need to find more agar to help my son finish the coolest experiment. Because when I came over to help him and read ""4 cups"", I filled 4 cups of water. Like normal measured cups...not the little one that was included with the kit. So we had very gushy agar in our petri dishes. :( So sorry little guy!And agar in a small amount does not seem to be easy to come by.We've bought some other science kit sets for kids and I'd say this is of about average quality. It didn't seem like there was as much to do with it as it looked like. (That is only partially related back to the whole ""cup"" incident!)But if your child loves Magic School Bus as mine does (and I'm all for it too), that connection can make it even more interesting. I'd say, if it's a good price...go for it!! Just check all those measurements carefully!!"
2,felco shears stick,"I am very disappointed in the Felco pruners I bought. I have trouble with them sticking- even though the release is correctly placed and I keep the blades clean. Every time I do a pruning cut, the shears stick closed and do not release, making it necessary to manually spread the blades for the next cut. For the price, I would have expected better performance and am not too enthusiastic about expensive pruners- give me the old cheapies after this."
2,Niether artist at there best,"I am familiar with much of Holger Czukays work with Can and solo and I have to say this the least spectacular recording he has made. Alot of the two discs fail to walk the very thin line of listenable dance music, which is what it is dance music. Not the place to start for either artist. A real letdown."
5,A excellent resource for a construction manager,"Although this book is intended and best suited for those working full time in excavation, it is also a useful reference for the construction manager/general contractor.The treatment of excavation methods seen from the viewpoint of those actually doing the work provided additional information and insight for those managing the whole project. The explantions were both detailed and practical, and the pictures and diagrams were helpful. Although the later sections on equipment problably will not be useful to me, I could not help reading them.A valuable addition to my reference library.Choosing Project Success - A Guide for Building Professionals"
4,Fine Book,"I wish I had this book when I was starting off; would have saved me a few grey hairs. Moving The Earth does a fine job at covering many situations that ""dirt guys"" find themselves in. This book won't teach you everything about earthwork, but it is an excellent reference that I would recommend to anyone involved excavation projects."
2,Be careful !,"From 3 CD-s I received one is defected, one partially defected .It even doesn't include all samples played in availible mp3 demo .Support will only offer you to buy more CD-s :-(("
5,What a Fantastic Surprise!,"I bought this book thinking it would be a story about a painter..his life complete with struggles and challenges. You know, the ususal biography. Boy, was I surprised! Yes, the book is about a painter but instead of HIS struggles, the reader is taken on a journey into the life of the painter's family...particularly his son. I couldn't put the book down! The author's writing style (son) has a way of drawing you in and really ""painting a picture"" of how life was growing up in a household where his father and he could just not connect. AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ! I experienced many similarities with my own father and reading this book really helped comfort me knowing ""I wasn't the only one."""
2,These are not Original Songs,While this CD is well done for what it is. It does not contain the original songs for these TV shows. They are all instrumental.
2,Scratchy Lining,"I've worn this bra for years and years. The last two bras I ordered have such a scratchy lining in the cup that I can't wear them without major irritation. I've written Playtex but haven't heard. In the meantime, I'm looking for a similar bra without the scratchy lining."
5,"Great support, beautiful bra",Great bra style by Playtex. Cross Your Heart bras have been a favorite style in my family for years and this beautiful Soft Cup bra is one reason why. It gives me just the right amount of coverage and the support that I keep getting from this amazing bra (even after years of wearing it) is nothing less than what I've always expected from a great brand by Playtex. My only wish is that this wonderful bra came in more (even though white is my favorite) colors!
3,Comfort okay but not a good match for me.,"The comfort on this bra is good, as far as the straps and body fit, but the shaping and placement of the cups is a little off for me. The lift and support of the cups was good, but the space between them was way to much for me. Gave me what I would call Grand Canyon cleavage, The girls were practically under my arm pits. Also the shape of the cups is, for lack of a better description, a little to pointy. I would not order this bra again. I got it based on the description and the way it looked on the model pictured. But, it certainly didn't look that good on me."
2,did not fit- will return,"I will be returning this product because it did not fit. From the picture it looked like it would but then when I took it out of the package, it did not."
2,Let's do the time warp again!!!,I think this bra is ok. There is nothing great or amazing about this bra. Its light. Thats it. But on to the interesting part. When I put this particular brazire on I'm instantly transported to the 1950's or at least my bosom is! Why must I look like madonna in a cone bra?I don't like it and after the 18 hours are up this bra becomes the most uncomfortable thing ever.Just don't bother!
2,Straps too short,"I use to buy the Playtex Cross Your Heart bra all the time, then couldn't find it anywhere, so I was glad to see it on Amazon. The size around and the cups fit ok. The problem is the straps, so much shorter than my other bras, which makes it very uncomfortable! I did not have this problem before so maybe the current CYH bra is not made exactly like the ones I use to buy."
2,not pleased,"I believe it is mis sized. I have used this brand for many years, but this was too tight to be comfortble."
4,Durable,"More durable than most bras. Washes well and you can throw it in the dryer with no shrinkage. I wish the elastic was a little less rigid because I find the bra is not particularly comfortable around the back. I wish someone could make a comfortable bra. This is not as comfortable as Playtex would like you to believe. Then again, most bras are uncomfortable as far as I am concerned."
2,returned it,This bra was not what I ordered and it was totally unacceptable to me. It was cheap and scratchy. I sent it back.
4,Playtex Bra,"I have used this bra for years, and bought it on Amazon because the price was much lower than anywhere elseIt's really hard to find my size without wires so this is my everyday braThey last a long time, don't put it in the dryer, that seems to discolor the elastic, otherwise it's a great bra"
2,Okay but would not buy again.,"This bra has a good fit, supports nicely, and I like the lace detail. My biggest complaint is the matterial it is made of. The fabric is rough and itchy feeling and can be uncomfortable. For this reason I will be spending my money on a different Playtex bra in the future."
4,Fits well and is comfortable.,I have never ordered a bra online before and was rather concerned that it would fit properly. It turned out to be fine and saved me a trip to the department store--plus it was a lot less expensive!
2,Product is different,"I have used Playtex Cross your heart bras for years, and always took a size 36B. Compared to the ones i have, and the ones I ordered - the size is very different and no longer fits. I have returned them for an A cup and have not received my replacements from Rockin Sox at this time.Thank you for your attention."
2,Very uncomfortable cups,"I never expected a Playtex bra to be so uncomfortable! The cups are lightly lined with some thin mesh-like fabric that is very itchy! I bought it for my 13-year-old daughter. She brought it back to me after trying it on and said, she just doesn't like it. I tried to wear it myself, but I couldn't handle the fabric. I ended up donating it to Goodwill.I prefer soft fabrics for a bra. The breast area is very sensitive and I can't stand to have a coarse, itchy bra on. I couldn't imagine wearing it in the hot Atlanta summer, sweating and having that mesh clinging to me.If you don't care about fabric, the bra was very well engineered otherwise. The cups had nice lift, even without an underwire. And the shoulder straps adjust in the front, so they are easier to reach. I would not buy it again, and I am glad I only paid $9.00 for it."
5,soft cup bra,I have used this product for about 10 years and I could not find it in the stores so I looked it up on Amazon and there it was. I was very happy.
3,Made for Madonna?,"This bra is nice, but I think it's a bit too ""cone-like"" for me. Makes me think of Madonna every time I put it on! I prefer a more rounded design... But the workmanship is fine and it has held up well since I bought it."
1,Mis-sized Bra,"I ordered 2 40D Cross your Heart bras. The band measurement was 31"". Guess I should have ordered a size 50D??????? I could not believe the band measurement. Naturally, they didn't fit-----you can't stuff 40 pounds of stuff into a 31 pound bag!!! I returned both and had no problem doing this and received my refund very promptly."
2,Very disappointed!,"This bra is very flimsy, you could probably punch a hole right through the side panels with your finger. It doesn't provide enough support for me. The Playtex bra that I had been wearing for years was abruptly discontinued so I gave this one a try...don't like it at all."
1,I was disappointed - strangely unfitting.,"The way it fits in real life is not at all like the photo they use for the product. There are 3 levels of hooks when there should be 2 at maximum, and the cups are oversized. Their B-cup is like a C. Also, the straps are very wide, and the whole bra is cumbersome, uncomfortable, and unflattering."
1,Switch-a-roo,"The picture was different when I ordered, so I thought I was getting more of a sports bra than this. It was uncomfortable and itchy and frumpy. I'm not particularly well-endowed, so I don't need a lot of support in my bras, which I'm sure this one would offer. I just wasn't right for me."
2,Disappointed,"This CD does not have enough jungle sounds like tigers (as pictured on the cover) or anything other than crickets and bug sounds. Once in a while in one of the tracks there is a larger animal sound, but not often. If you want bugs and crickets this is the CD for you. If you want tigers and other cool sounds, I would recommend finding another CD."
2,Disappointing,The descriptions were lovely but seemed to be the raison d'etre for the book. I kept thinking it would get better. If I hadn't bought it on CD I would have abandoned it quite early on. Characters were not engaging and seemed unapproachable. I thought it might have been the reader at first but I don't think so. Kipling seemed a caricature of himself.
2,your time can be better spent,"I am disappointed in this book. I forced myself back into it repeatedly. But it never did fully come together and hold my attention. I wish I had read something else. Some of the use of language is beautiful. But I did not feel like I had more insight into Kipling after reading this than I would have if I had just googled him. The character development is weak and choppy. The book feels pieced togetherIf you are stuck in the backwoods of Vermont and this is the only book available, or if you are on a long plane ride and the choice is this or the airline magazine, read it. Otherwise, please wait for her next novel. This one comes close sometimes, but it seems that she has not fully made the transition from short story to novel. Her writing shows promise but that promise has not been kept in this novel."
3,Fails to live up to expectations,"Everyone seems to be raving about this book. The premise is terrific -- Kipling's interactions with a neighboring Vermont farming family. However, I just couldn't develop a sense of sympathy with any of the characters. I want to like Kipling because I like his work. I want to like Joe (the boy who befriends Rudyard Kipling) because his life is hard. Nevertheless, I don't really like these characters - or care much about them. It saddens me because I really wanted to like the book as well."
2,Not the same as the picture,"My brother has this model and it works great. So I ordered it from from Target online and was displeased because it's not the same shredder. It's the same model number but it does not have the convenient clear button that allows you to clear the shredder of paper. So when it gets jammed, and it does, you have to unplug the shredder, remove the top and dig out the shreddings. It also refused to work after about 4 minutes of use and you must let it cool down for 2-3 hrs. So don't let the items you must shred build up or shredding it will be an all day affair. My brother's has gone for as long as 15 minutes without needing to cool down and he bought it at Target instead of online. It does however shred paper pretty well so I gave it 2 stars. Will be looking for another one soon but this time I'll make the trip to the store."
5,same as the picture and it's a great shredder,"I got it from the seller, price_busters and it is the exactly same one as the picture. It works great. It can shred papers and even credit cards into unreadable small pieces. It works for up to 5 pages of papers at one time and has gone for as long as 15 minutes without cooling down. It is fairly quiet and even has an auto button to allow it to work only when it actually detects papers into it. You can also easily clear it when it's jammed using a reverse button. Furthermore, the trash basket is very easy to empty it and holds quite a bit. I even put a trash bag into it and throw away a whole bag. I am quite satisfied with it."
1,Make sure you buy some needlenose pliers too,"This product worked OK for 3 months then the shredder began to fall apart. There are little finger like pieces (that are breaking off) underneath the shredding area which began to collect paper and cause the paper to backup and jammed in the shredding mechanism. The more fingers that fall off, the faster paper backs up and gets jammed. So after every 10-15 pages I have to get out a pair of needlenose pliers and pull the impacted paper out of these tiny slots. It takes about 10 minutes of extreme frustration to unclog this clunker. That's about a minute a page. This is obviously completely unacceptable because if I had enough time to spend 1 minute to shred each piece of paper I would be paper mache artist.Now, I just use it to store paper until I buy a new shredder. This product was a complete disappointment for me."
3,"Not much ""Royalty"" here!","The first time I used the shredder I had a build up of papers to shred. It worked for about 10 minutes before having to shut down for overheating. After that first shut down, it was about every 5 minutes when continuously shredding. After that first day, I have used it only periodically for credit card offers, etc. It does a fine job when only shredding 1-2 sheets of paper, but any more than that really slows it down. For my general use, it is adequate, but I wouldn't recommend it for any sort of volume shredding. Another complaint is the mesh basket allows a lot of paper dust to accumulate on the floor around the shredder."
3,"Fast shipping, but broke down in a couple of weeks","Seller was quite prompt in shipping the item--but it stopped working only a few weeks after I got it. I never even approached the ""five pages at a time"" limit."
1,Spend the extra money for a better product,"I bought this thinking it would do the job. I have little shredding to do. As it turns out, I used it once and it broke down. You can't see what wrong, so I took it back. My mistake was I exchanged it for another. Used the second one 3 times and then it broke down. Considering the whole thing a loss at this point. I didn't shredd excessive amounts of paper and there was no reason for it to stop working. Will probably spend more money and do a little more research next time."
1,Do yourself a favour and don't buy this shredder!,"I'm very disappointed with this shredder. I got it back in October 2006, and I have only used it about 3 or 4 times. First of all, although the product is supposed to shred up to 5 sheets at a time - IT DOES NOT. It will get jammed, so I only shred 1 or 2 sheets at a time. Tonight I used it again, and it became completely jammed from a few sheets. I cannot get it to work again. It is very loud and a bit slow, but I can live with that, I just don't like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times. I recommend others spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable shredder, unlike the Royal ""5-sheet"" Crosscut Shredder HT500x."
1,waste basket collector,"I've gone through three shredders but this one is the worst. It's loud and jams easily. The others were loud and jammed too but this particular one lasted me only three months. When it jammed, power automatically shutdown. I kept it in reverse and waited for power to come back about one to two hours later. I'm kinda ruthless with the shredders, sticking papers with staplers, tape or dried glue, and I'm pretty impressed that the other shredders lasted so long. Not this one, it came from planet pms and work only when it was in the mood. I kept the baskets and placed one in each room. Looking for the one I bought before this one. At least it lasted almost four years. Wish me luck."
1,Stay away from this shredder!,"I purchased this model at a local store after reading mixed reviews. It was in my price range and had at least some good reviews so I thought I'd take a chance. WOW, bad idea! After about 25 sheets of paper fed 1 page at a time the feed mechanism stopped functioning. I was careful not to overload the unit or run it too long, but the thing didn't last 5 minutes!!! Stay away!"
5,works great so far...,"This shredder works pretty good. It does overheat after long continuous use (15 min roughly) but that's only if you let your paper pile up like I did. I would also say putting 5 sheets of paper maximum into the shredder is a little inaccurate. It goes slow so i put less than that in at a time. I'm pretty happy with it so far, but we haven't had it that long."
1,Junk.,I've used it for less than a year. Already fixed it once by taking the thing apart. Just broke again. Not going to bother with it again... I'm getting a better one.Overheats very easily too.Has trouble with credit cards even though it's supposed to shred them just fine.Summed up... Royal shredders are GARBAGE. Other than the motor and the blade it's all plastic components.
3,"5 stars for supplementary content, 1 star for binding quality","My comments are not about the play ""Le Tartuffe"" itself, but about this edition of the book. I teach French literature and often choose Petits Classiques Larousse editions because they contain excellent supplementary resources to facilitate comprehension, analysis and discussion. Each text includes an author biography, background information situating the work in its historical and social context, discussion questions after each act/section/chapter, and an analysis of major themes of the work. These editions are also reasonably priced...but poorly bound. After one reading the pages begin to fall out."
1,Warning: Do NOT read!,"""Tartuffe"" by Moliere is a feeble attempt at extrodinary literature. The writing itself is lacking in drama and power, and the development of the play through rhyme patterns fails to alleviate the torment of reading it. The reader must realize that at the time Moliere was penning this work, he was in debtor's prison. His clever incorporation of monarchial laud was his means of finding favor in the prince to possibly mitigate his sentence, as well as for him [Moliere] to raise enough to set bail. ""Tartuffe"" is a boring play satirizing Catholic religion and ignorant people who are duped by a wily man using God to deceive and rob a family who cannot see the true nature of Tartuffe. In fact, ""tartuffe"" is French for ""thief"". I seriously would not recommend reading this play, and know 11 other people who would agree."
3,Another chapter in MS Disappointment,"I was astonished at the novelty of this system. The first time I used it I found a new quicker route home from the office. But I have found it is not as I would like it to be.. The altitude measure is completely bogus. I can be a 400 ft elevation and ten seconds down a flat road be at 135 ft elevation. I can be parked and have the elevation and velocty drift around. +/- 10 ft, +1/-0 mph. The feature for getting directions to destination from my current location is very clunky and often unavailable. The least cloud cover appears to disable the GPS sensor - it has been blind more often than not. I have seen glowing reviews of the GPS sensor - and perhaps in high dry regions of the country it's great, otherwise I don't understand entirely positive reviews."
3,Excellent value for the money,"It does not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive products have but for the price it can't be beat!I used it on a 3300 mile RV trip with our laptop and it worked well considering its limitations. A person does need some patience when starting out using it.It is very accurate and can reroute when needed but not as fast as other navigational units. It does not allow map updates, so what you see is what you get but if you want a starter unit that works with a laptop I would recommend it. You will need a co-driver in order to use while driving as finding and changing functions is somewhat slow, otherwise you need to stop along the road to use the mouse pad. An advantage of a laptop is the availability of a large screen.The thing I did not like particularily is when choosing shortest route in or near a city it will find the shortest route but at the expense of taking more time and making lots of turns on all types of streets and roads, but it is accurate!"
4,Maps and Directions are Great!,"I'm a dispatcher for a large trucking company that sends drivers all over the US. With this program I can give detailed directions to the drivers anywhere they go. I've used other mapping software but this one is the best I've found for mapping out step by step directions, zooming in quickly and finding highway/freeway offramps. Downside is that I could never get the GPS locator to work. I was going to purchase this software anyway and I thought the locator would be great to install on my laptop. If the GPS would work this software would be perfect!"
3,Bad map data spoils a good product.,"I eagerly look forward to each new edition of Streets and Trips, having selected it as ""best"" some years ago. The 2007 edition has - unexplainedly - introduced bad map data near me. Specifically, there are ""locked gate"" PennDOT-only access and service plaza service roads being used for routing along the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the Philadelphia suburbs. Clearly this is bad map data in the 2007 edition. Anyone traveling through this area, beware, as the routes are impossible to follow."
1,Pretty much useless,"You would have thought that with the power of a PC behaind it this will be the most capable navigation program. Unfortunately, it is by far the worst navigation software ever devised. Combined with a crappy receiver that takes forever to aquire the satellites (initially I thougt that hardware has failed!)and loses them often, it is a complete waste of money. Too bad there are no negative stars, one star is way too high a rating.I would provide all the gory details of my experience with this product but I am barfing on my keyboard every time I think about it.If you are a masochist, you'll really enjoy this product!!!"
2,Check this before taking it to the Streets,"Before buying the product, I did not think to test my laptop in my vehicle. If I had, I would not have bought this product. I have the 2004 version of Streets and Trips on my desk PC and use it a lot and thought it would be cool to get the GPS version for my laptop to actually use on a real trip. The first time I tried to use it, I realized my laptop screen went unreadble in bright sunlight. My entire justification for buying went out the window. I did not need a second copy of S&T for a laptop and I certainly did not need the pricier GPS version."
3,Watch the screen,this product was good on receiving. The problem is with the laptop screen in that there is a good probility that the screen will break at the connection to the laptop. if you have a tablet style this will work great if you have a bright screen.
4,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 with GPS Locator [DVD],"Excellent software, it could use more user help or be a bit more frendly. Instalation is somewhat confusing but once is up and running works fine. I would sugest more in detail maps for regions outside the US and options for more zooming, this would make it a better software even if it cost more or to give the option if needed to get a more detailed map for the region the user lives at."
4,GPS limitations,"Streets is mostly very good, but there are limits to database of local addresses and pins, especially in smaller cities and towns. The Trips portion is a pretty good guide, and has become increasingly accurate. I was looking forward to the GPS component which I bought for the first time along with my yearly purchase of the program. But I note it does not seem to receive a signal from my various locations. I'll need to see what happens when I get on the road this spring, and use the attachment to affix the receiver to a window - which strikes me as a bit of a bother, when it's already a hassle to run my laptop from the slanted shotgun seat."
4,Trips 2007 with GPS,Purchased because antenna on 2006 went bad with little use. 07 has much improved #500 antenna. I like the program a lot but volume should be louder so it can be heard over road noise. This is a problem as one of the vehicles I have is a Lexus that is very quiet but the program needs more volume. I n some screens it doesn't display the location arrow. I don't know if mine is defective or it is a software deficiency.
1,Microsoft in the name means it doesn't have to work!,"I've used the gps twice, and had some difficulty getting it to reconize where I was the first time. The second time was even harder, the program keeps telling me that it can't find enough signals. This with the ""GPS"" attachment stuck to the front windshield.I also was disappointed that I couldn't cut and paste addresses into the program to search."
2,not exactly,"I give this product 2 stars. When traveling gps voice does not indicate street names. insted it indicates yard or mile one is from next exit. When looking up a location complete address has to be entered. When searching for a location ie search looks throughout the united states and not the state indicated.Ok program. not worth the money. Better off getting a real GPSthe one feature it has going for itself is the trip planner. However, shortest distance, frequent use of highway options are not available. It says so but hard to tell the difference if any between routes. I have also found myself getting lost more frequently with the GPS. Cross refrence with google.maps if in doubt."
4,Streets and Trips,The streets and trips merchandise was delivered on time and in great condition. We already had the software and it was damaged so this was a perfect replacement.
4,Prevention to a massive headache and Marriage saver.....,"Would highly recommend. We attend dog show that are in the middle of no were... This product got us to EVERY SHOW we have been to since we started using it in March 2007.We especially in enjoyed the feature of being able to find what kind of business were in the area were.We hate getting lost especially with a truck loaded down with dogs and conformation equiptment, this product has stopped that from happening. It would be nice if the 2008 version: 1 - it spoke the name of the streets while it was giving you the next turn 2- it would get rid of that agreement screen everytime you use it, once should be enough and 3 - It would be nice if we could log on to the web and down load the latest addition of gas station, place to eat and etc... while we were down loading the construction updates. This product is a good buy for the money.."
3,"If you want to drive alone, this is not for you.","Installation went smooth. I directly plugged the GPS device to laptop, with out extension wire. Didn't have any problem with the satilite signals.The only problem for me is, It is difficult to use this when driving alone. I feel that the following simple options can make the product more useful.- option to set Frequent voice updates.- read out Street names.- Option to recalculate the route automatically, when it detects detour.Hopefully microsoft addes them in next version, or gives an updates to the current users."
2,Not Intuitive; Overly Complex,"I've not been satisfied with this product. Software should be intuitive, and it seems I continually need to refer to the manual to figure out what's happening. I suppose with enough practice I'll get it all ironed out, but competing products seem much more intelligently designed. I've seen a DeLorme in action and it appears to be a far better design, so today I purchased it. I'll provide an eval on it in the future."
1,The USB Stick Thing was broken in Product Box,"I hate this unit. The software sucks but on top of that, the product is flimsy. The GPS unit (a square button thing) is supposed to be attached to a USB stick. One end of this stick is attached to the GPS unit and the other end into the computer (or the supplied cable which then inserts into the USB port of your computer). This USB stick which sits in the middle is the worst product I have seen (from a quality standpoint). The USB stick has a seam which is coming apart. In my case it came that way in the box but I am telling ya, it is easy to break that seam! I am not sure you can get the replacement USB stick or kiss your GPS setup goodbye but in my case, I don't wantto take chances. I am gonna return this and try out the Garmin Mobile 10 GPS (with Software)Garmin Mobile 10 Bluetooth-Enabled GPS Systemand see if I have better luck (its much costlier though)"
2,Get a real GPS,"OK, the maps are good, but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car. It is very disracting and can easily cause an accident. Does not work aroung Lincoln tunnel area. Also would not find my home street, and I have been there for 2 years. Either the one I got was defected, or its not what other make it out to be. I had to return mine."
5,"If you don't mind using your PC, this is the best for the money!!!","I have tried several other GPS programs - and this is by far the best out there in my opinion! Perfect directions, fast to redirect you, lets you know about construction... it has saved me time quite a few times! I tried a handheld GPS and the main difference is that the Microsoft Locator is just much more powerful than the handhelds I have tried. I don't have to stop the car to locate a satelite if I turn it on while I am driving. The Microsoft GPS Locator can find a satelite as I'm driving down the road! Obviously the fact that you need it connected to a PC is not as convenient as carrying a smaller handheld device but I usually have my laptop in the car anyway. On long trips we watch DVD's on the laptop and the GPS simply runs in the background. I would definitely recommend this for long trips. For running around a city, having to open up my laptop is not quite as convenient... but you can't beat the price for a GPS!"
3,i'm a professional driver. i use 2006 S & T,"first off. the maps are horrible. they are missing a lot of streets. i have to go onto my wireless internet to verify addresses on yahoo. very cumbersome.second, the routing is not ideal especially for someone that is using something other than a car. i have to go over the routes and sometimes make corrections before i leave. other times i can't know and it is very frustrating with an 18-wheeler.in summary, this product could be great, but microsoft doesn't use the right people to create it. however, you can still make it work for you by adapting. nevertheless, i still like having the gps in real-time and being able to save locations and routes after i verify everything."
4,Streets and Trips 2007,"product gets good reception, but the streets highways are not up to date. Trip to West Yellowstone took me through 2 cities downtown areas, not the freeway. Coustom abilities are its saving grace. For a few dollors more you could get a Tom-Tom or similar product. Having top hook up to your laptop in a vehicle and not having a copilot is a pain and alot of wires."
4,"Generally useful, at a good price","The new sensor acquires satellites more quickly, and the software provides more accurate solutions, compared to previous versions.My big problem is the extent of the database of locations. My family is interested in National Parks, National Forests, etc (a good deal for the taxpayers, in my eyes), but these are not available. When I wanted directions to the Manassas battlefield, I could only get directions to the town. The map shows something north of the town, but it is not well identified.A solution would be to provide the ability for me to add a category (Lebanese restaurants, anyone?), and to add records. Push pins aren't quite up to the task.Otherwise, I found the product really helpful, with a good interface."
4,2007 an Improvement,"I'm a long-time user of Streets and 2007 has some subtle improvements, including a full-screen view when using the GPS. The full-screen view has a large button to re-route if you miss a turn (not like anyone tries to use the laptop while driving) and an estimated arrive time. I purchased 2007 since it sounds like the 2008 product activiation can be a nightmare."
2,Had to return it,The GPS unit stopped working the first time we tried it so we had to return it for a refund.
2,Works most of the time,"I recently hauled my laptop to Hawaii solely for GPS. I also bought car inverter for long trips. I was really disappointed by the results. The GPS took long times to lock to satelite (as much as 10 mins sometimes). On highways its sensitivity was really low. The driving directios for lot of points was screwed up. Don't drive to Hanauma Bay using MS S&T.;The biggest problem I faced was that the driving directions will not specify which direction to take on HWY (I mean w,s,n or e). It will just say take H1 and I had to guess H1 E or H1 W. Try HNL to Hanauma Bay Natural preserve Honolulu.Further more this GPS solution is very cumbersome (especially since the included suction cup) doesn't stick very long, thus the gps receiver keeps falling off.The reason I bought this unit was to postphone buying a real GPS for a year or two. In retrospect it was a bad decision...."
5,Trip GPS,Great GPS for the money. Works great! Prompt delivery from seller and condition as advertised.
1,Nothing more than a brick,"Bought it less than a year ago. First went bad in three months after some light use. I was using it as RAID 1 but I was told by support that nothing can be recovered. So much for RAID. The replacement lasted for four months. Another replacement has just arrived and its already bad.Whatever the specs, stay away from this product."
2,Worse then you expect,"I knew when I bought this device that I was betting that the drives wouldn't fail for a long time, because the drives are not user replaceable.Of course, after the warranty expired, one of the drives failed. The diagnostics indicate that a drive needs replacement --- but not which drive. To make matters worse, according to Seagate's technical support --- and I quote --- ""The error codes are encrypted so we would not be able to say exactly what the problem is other then it needs to be replaced"".I realized I was buying a ""closed solution"", but I hadn't realized just how closed. Encrypted error codes? That's insane."
1,AVOID AVOID AVOID!,"I just had one of the most infuriating tech support experiences ever - and I've been in IT for 30 years! My drive stopped working after a few months. When I finally got to a tech support person he flat out told me ""What you have there is an expensive paperweight."" They have NO options for repairing it - period. I tried to leave this feedback on their website but (not surprisingly) they have no email address for complaints or comments."
4,Works Great,I have a huge Movie collection that I keep on these servers. I have two of them with USB storage drives connected to them. No problems and easy setup. Going to buy 2 more
1,Horrible! Awful! Please don't waste your money!,"This seems like a great way to go, but it's awful. Truly awful. It's good if you want to back up a few files and don't plan to read/write to the drive very often. But if you plan to use it as a small shared data server (which is what's it's supposedly designed for), don't waste your time or money. The software is problematic. The drive crashes easily and needs constant attention. And the service was ridiculously bad. Maxtor basically told me to take a hike when I called after the latest crash."
1,Same experience as the other posters,"The second day after I purchased this product the power light started flashing amber. This error code is not listed in the actual manual, but on the maxtor site it states that it means there's a problem with the file system... I have to throw my vote in with the others, avoid this product."
2,Ms. Independent **One Spoiler**,"I am a HUGE Hideway series fan I started with Martin & Paris and could not get enough. That being said I was unable to finish this book. My first issue was that Emily took the whole independent woman thing to far. There were times that she would cut Chris down that I actually cringed. **Spoiler** When Cris asked her to go with him to see his father (clearly a BIG moment in his life) Emily automatically said no. There wasn't a let me think on it until he practically begged her and she was still snotty about it. That is where the book ended for me. Emily had one too many snappy remarks, stay out of my business, I can handle this on my own moments for my taste. Next and final issue is that this book was so slow. I can devour most books in a two day period. This one just dragged for me. I could no longer keep trying.I am still a Hideaway fan but will just simply skip the rest of Private Passions."
3,Just not up to snuff,"I have read several of Ms. Alers books and for the most part they have been good. I was a little disappointed in the books because the two main characters had been waiting so long for each other (stil not really sure way the wait),but the story line, as well as, the characters were just so flat, nothing of any excitment. Hopefully, her next book will make you want to turn the page."
2,Not that impressed.,"I like old movies, but I couldn't follow this one that much. Very old but I just couldn't watch it all the way thru. I got it because Joseph Schildkraut was in it. He was in Marie Antionette and he was outstanding in that picture. But I just couldn't get into this one. Plot is not great. Thank you."
1,Absolutely unforgivable.,"This is absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen,in a long,long time. Not horrible in a enjoyable way,see,but horrible in such a way if I ever see Jerry O'Connell I will ask for my money back.Let's see..Jerry O'Connell has only about two facial expressions to work with,the Busey kid creeps me out beyond belief,(hey,just like Dad!!) Shannon Elisabeth is totally wasted and the gags are not funny,especially the long drawn out bit with the discarded testicle. Stay far away from this. Jerry O'Connell ruins every movie he's in. Julia Schultz is wasted as well!! If you see it at a video store and accidentally pick it up,put it down quick,and wash your hands!!!"
2,shannon elizbateh iz soooooooooo hott!!...,"oh my god whez iz saw her in americazn pie i thoiught she waz da bomb! i mean cmon just look at her! i only saw this movie for her and i'm not to glad i did. besides the fact thz she jsust perfect in itz, and should getz abn oscar nomination for thiz film, the reszt isz bad. not very funny pretty disgusting thoiugh. itz made me puke! great job shannon...!"
4,Funny,This 2001 sex comedy delivers the goods. It is very funny especially with its gross out humor bits. You will laugh from beginning to end. The acting in the movie is pretty good. And the beautiful Shannon Elizabeth looks so hot as she usually does. This movie is great fun and will have you wanting more.
3,A Comedy For Open Minded People,"yes you definently have to have an open mind to watch this outrageos movie. There are funny Scenes, and there are not so much funny scenes. Some Characters were very flat, I felt they could of expanded their personality a little. Definently the star of the screen was Shannon Eliziabeth, with her dashing looks and big brown eyes.Overall a funny little movie."
5,Shannon Elizabeth,"I saw this movie in the theatres and just because it isn't out, doesn't mean we can't judge it yet. I think it will be good. Shannon Elizabeth is stunningly beautiful and O'Connel is hilarious 5 out of 5."
1,Wretched In Every Possible Way,"This movie fails in every possible way a comedy can:The characters are so repellent and unfunny that you don't care what happens to them.The story barely exists after 20 minutes.The ""gags"" are torturously lame, especially the scene involving a hospital cafeteria and David Ogden Stiers.Growing up in the 80's, we sat through a lot of horrible comedies aimed at the all-important teen male audience only to hear, ""Well, that sucked but at least we got to see (hot actress name here) naked.""TOMCATS doesn't even deliver on that.What's the point?"
1,Absolutely the worst comedy of the last decade,"Where to start? It's a comedy, yet it's not funny. It's a movie, yet there's no acting in it (at least none that could be called that).Jokes are at a junior high level, if that. Director must've slept through most of the production. But absolutely the worst part are these so called actors, I really wish somebody would explain to them that they are badly in need of another profession.Oh, and I almost forgot, the plot is so predictable that the whole movie is obvious about 5-10 minutes into it.Yes, the lead female role is played by a very beatiful non-actress. That perhaps is it's only redeaming feature.Bottom line: Your money is better spend invested into Enron!"
1,Just Plain Drivel,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is lowest common denominator movie-making at its worst. It makes American Pie look like Shakespeare. Unless you have the IQ and emotional maturity of a 9 year old, avoid this drivel."
5,Toto Bona Lokua,"I really enjoy this CD. The rhythms and tones seem so natural. ""Na Ye"" is my favorite track!"
5,Best kept secret in the Lonestar State,"Lonestar Pornstar is the best kept secret in the Lonestar State! Protection has been on heavy rotation in my stereo, can't wait till they drop a new album. Keep rockin 'em live LSPS!"
5,this music makes you happy!,"When Mike Mcclure wrote in one of is blog's about the good old days with Great Divide, I was listning again to the CD's. Yes indeed, GREAT music!Looking around on the internet I found Dirt & Spirit. I'm not religious at all, but this tunes touched me deep. Nice easy going music, Mike and friends.It was though to get a hard copy, they are really sold out, but at least I got one. Heiko Wester, Hetherlands."
4,Hyponist: A Thrill Ride For The Mind,"This film was well written. The beginning was a bit gruesome. Overall it's thought provoking and a bit mind bending. It has a surprising plot twist. The ending is very abrupt, wierd, and effective at the same time. A classic tale of horror! Somewhat creepy, it leaves disturbing images in the mind for at least an hour after watching. Definitely worth seeing! The only bad thing, there were too many previews on the disc before the film."
2,Barely mediocre at very best.,"I bought this, then sold it that same week. The characters are unbelievable. The story is original, but weak and convoluted. Sorry, but come on. I like to be given credit as a viewer. The Special FX are pretty bad, too. CGI for the death scenes? CGI for breaking glass, even? UGH! I hate to give a bad review, but people ranted and raved about this movie for a while. I sought it out, but was left disapointed and irritated."
2,same old stuff,"Strawson's work reigned as the supreme example of Kant scholarship in English for several decades. It might have been ok for its time, but it offers the typical idealist interpretation of Kant, and attempts to separate the contents of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic from his Transcendental Analytic, arguing that only the contents of the latter have merit. But the two sections play the similar roles in Kant's revolution and to wholly reject the aesthetic and not the analytic is, I believe, impossible. Strawson does not even take seriously the arguments of Kant's aesthetic, probably because he is English and the English always get nervous around the aesthetic. While one may still have to deal with this book if writing a paper on Kant, as Strawson is still held in fairly high regard, I would recommend this book only for one who is not familiar with the traditional idealist interpretations of Kant."
4,Short..but sweet.,"While some fans of the band might consider this a mini album compared to some of their work, what it lacks in quantity it more than makes up for in quality. This is music that lures you into it's own little world ,beguiling and elegant. It is by now obvious how The Llamas and Stereolab interact and influence each other,but this is definitely a High Llamas disc. Overall this is a gentle ,dreamy collection of songs that like all the Llamas work just keeps opening up and breathing into you.Highly recommended."
2,"item is pretty good, price is high","Cheaper in the local large hardware store.Slim, you have to figure out what to do with the cords if you link them - otherwise they hang there looking bad, but otherwise go to your local L**** or H*** D**** for better prices."
1,Don't By This Cable!,"Seriously, it's NOT plug and play compatible! How hard is it to make a cable that works correctly? When I swapped out my perfectly good cable that was just too short, Windows failed to recognize my monitor as a DELL monitor. Instead, it shows ""Generic Non-PnP Monitor"" and reset my monitor settings and put the DELL monitor in a ""safe"" mode resolution.But that's not all. My monitor now fails to recognize when the computer wants to put it into sleep mode. Instead, the monitor stays on and thinks that I have unplugged the cable.Piece of junk. Don't waste your money. I'm going to toss it as it's not worth the hassle of returning.Can anyone recommend a 12' to 15' VGA cable that works?"
4,JOYRIDE! NUMBER! TWO!,I don't really wanna say a lot about this album.It's just a shame really that a lot of people put it off as being bad and uninspiring....Really underated and i can't see why since there are so many good tunes in here.It's not better than Joyride(which album is?) but it comes close as being their second best after it...It rocks a bit harder and the dance influences are well crafted.Excellent production.Crappy sleeve.A band on top form.
5,"Not only ""Sleeping in my car""","When I've buyed this album I was happy to have finally the ""Sleeping in my car"" song, but when I've listened all the songs I've appreciate this album very very much and now I think is the best album of this group. All is great, only ""I love the sound of crashing guitars"" is more stupid but it could change you to a happy people. ""Love is all[shine your light on me]"" is the best composition of the last years ( since Queen songs), close your eyes and it can make you dream. All is perfect, I will listening this album for the rest of my life ( With ""Joyride"" and ""Tourism"", of course )."
4,It's a shame this CD didn't get much exposure in the US,"This album has something for every one: Hard Driving rock (Crashing Guitars, Harleys and Indians) Acoustic classics (Place Your Love, First Girl on the Moon), lush ballads (CBB, Love is all around (Shine your light). I think because Roxette didn't decide to tour the US is one of the major reasons this album didn't do well (that and lack of support from EMI America. The only complaint I have is that it's more than an hour long and there are too many filler songs."
5,"Very good work, by a brilliant cricket writer","I am an avid cricket fan and have been for a few years now. This book captures the brilliance of 25 great players. The writing is exceptional and the pictures are phenomenal. Great for a novice cricket fan who wants background on the history of the greats; and perfect for anyone who eats, sleeps, and drinks cricket because of the details captured and the arguments made for the rankings.Not only is this book great, but anything that Geoff Armstrong has worked on emanates his dedication and knowledge of this most grand sport."
3,"A lot of ups and downs, either hilarious or depressing","I was much more impressed with the follow-up novel, ""Divine Secrets..."" The first half of the book, very visual, about growing up in Louisiana with the greatest mother in the world. The second half was about alcoholism, sexual abuse, and the life of adults trying to combat their dysfunctional childhoods. Overall, it was entertaining, though some parts just went on and on and I began to wonder if the book needed to be as long as it was. Would still like to know Lulu's take on everything that happened."
2,"IF YOU LIKED THE ""YA-YA'S"" SKIP THIS BOOK","I read the ""Ya-Ya's"" and enjoyed it for the most part. However if I had read this book first I would never have picked up the second book! I was shocked to find out that Vivi had molested all of her children. How could R.W. have written a second book that made Vivi a fun likable character, when she was an awful person. I think that R.W. must have had a terrible childhood and a mother who was also incestious to write a book like this. Also the story was disjointed and boring. I nolonger like the ""ya-ya's"" anymore because of this book."
3,"Semi-dark and disturbing, NOT the Ya Ya's...",I read this book after the Ya Ya Sisterhood and it changed my perceptions of that book too. Vivi was way more disturbed than you were lead to believe. If you loved the Ya Ya's Don't read this dark explanation of their lives.
3,"you may curse me, but i did NOT like this book!","I was told to read this before the Divine Secrets, and made the mistake of doing so. The storylines were undeveloped, especially regarding Lulu and a certain storyline with Vivi that I noticed was not a part of Divine Secrets. I ended the book wanting more, and wondering where it was! Divine Secrets was better, but after the bad taste Little Altars left in my mouth, I could hardly enjoy it."
4,funny and very sad at the same time,i read this book in 2 days. i couldn't put it down. rebecca wells has such a dynamic way of writing. the stories of all the characters in this book are so real and even though they are tragic the humility and humurous way wells writes you can't seem to cry you just seem to smile and think and keep reading. i was told to read this book first and now that i'm reading the second novel...i recommend everyone do the same. this book is an amazing read you must try it!
5,Read this one first!,"Everyone knows the success of the Ya Ya book, but this one is actually better (if that's possible)and should be read first to get the true vision that the author had in mind. The writing just flows, and you will be swept away. It was one of those books that I savored right down to the last page, and then I went back and read the intro again."
4,Enjoyed but disappointed,"I loved the first two chapters of this book. I thought it was going to be a funny novel. But there is nothing funny about the tragic turn the childrens' lives takes. Also, the second half of the book was pretty confusing. But Siddalee was a wonderful character and made this novel enjoyable. Overall, I enjoyed the novel - especially the first half - and would recommend it."
3,Anticipation was let down...,"Having read The Divine Secrete of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood first, I had already invested my time and emotions in the Walker family and the extended Ya-Ya's when I came upon this book. I felt the characters were very rich in the Divine Ya-Ya's, but they seemed lost and shallow in this first novel. The horrors the children endured from their mother is unexplained until the second novel, when her past is exposed. The end is vague and incomplete, plus it does not connect well to the second novel.All in all, I was not as pleased with this book as I was the second."
2,Stick to the Ya-Yas,If you like the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood then don't read this book. It takes all your favorite characters and ruins them. I had been really looking forward to reading this book and it ended up making me cranky.
1,Avoid it!,"Why I did this to myself, I will never know....I thought the Ya Ya was totally overrated and BAD...and then I decide to try this one...and it is equally a bad book. Is there a conspiracy out there to PRETEND these books are good? Both this and Ya Ya? Well....save yourself the time and find something worthwhile! BELIEVE ME!"
3,Somewhat Disappointed After All The Good Reviews,"Little Altars Everywhere by Rebecca Wells was recommended by a friend as a good summer read. Unfortunately, I was distracted by the twists in chronology and the different points of view presented in this novel. It had its hilarious moments, but for the most part, they were overshadowed by the Walker family's serious dysfunctions. However, I still want to give Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood a try..."
3,"Its no ""divine secret"" this doesn't quite measure up","I was dissapointed in this book, having read the YA-YA Sisterhood first. This just can't compare, while some of the background is interesting, having the narrator change with each chapter was too distracting, IMHO."
2,"IN COMPARISON TO DIVINE SECRETS, IT DOESN'T STACK UP!","I read Divine Secrets first and absolutely LOVED it. I was disappointed by Little Altars. It was depressing, too many points of view which led to poor character development compared to her 2nd book. Had I read this book first, I would not have chosen to read another of Wells' books, which would have been unfortunate."
3,Don't Expect Hilarity,"Unlike the best-selling follow-up Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, this novel is rarely funny and often cruel. It chronicles the lives of the Walker family of Thornton, Louisiana from varied personal perspectives. Viviane Abbot Walker (mother of Siddalee who is the narrator in Divine Secrets) appears in this story as a crazed alcoholic child abuser. The horror of what the Walker children went through at the hands of Viviane is only whispered in the latter book, but screams out here. Ms. Wells' writing style is impeccable, of course, but I would have done better to read LITTLE ALTARS first-or not at all as it soured the joy of her sequel"
5,"Humor, tragedy, life...","Real people populate Rebecca Wells novels. Her multi-dimensional characters are all at once self confident, insecure, self destructive, hurtful, loving, and playful. In a nutshell, the characters are as flawed as real people, and that's just what makes them so interesting. We've all met people like this and wondered what goes on behind closed doors. Rebecca Wells shares their lives with us."
4,So this is what happened to Vivi!,"I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood before I read Little Altars, and I think I should have read them in order. While I Loved the Ya-Ya's and found so much to take away with me from that novel, I had questions about Sidda and her family, especially her mom, Vivi. I found Little Altars to be a darker, sadder novel than the Ya-Ya's, but it gave me the history of the families and the background to fill in the blanks. If you only read one of Wells novels, read the Ya'Ya's, but if you have the inclination, start with this one. It is good and will leave you anticipating the next one. Debbi"
2,"a mishmosh of alcoholism, child abuse, and immature adults","I was very much disappointed . It was a soap opera told from varying points of view but with one major intention to shock the reader with its descriptions of alcoholism, child abuse, and adult irresponsibility. The Yayas' bonding seemed to be only an excuse to escape the confines of marriage and motherhood. The title and the description of its significance appears to be a pathetic attempt to add literary value to a novel without it."
3,Hmm... Disturbing,"Well..you coudln't really say it's an excellant novel because the Divine Secrets is definitely better. I too support a reader who said that everyone should read the Divine secrets first before reading this. Because this is really just a compilation of short stories of the Walker Family.It doesn't really tell much. BUt as a short stories collection, I still find something to laugh at..."
4,Wow!!,"Well this book was not at all what I expected! It's so much darker than I thought it would be. I thought the Ya-Yas where a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky kinda group (I'm basing this on the few previews I saw of the movie)...but no...not at all. I didn't expect constant drunkiness, child-abuse, and cruelty. It did make for a very entertaining read though...as awful as that sounds.I couldn't put the book down! The messed-up world of the Walker family is funny, tragic, happy and sad all in one. I really recommend this book. I've just picked the 'Divine Secrets', and am really looking forward to what more this family can get themselves into!! Definitely a must read!"
2,"sharply bitter, lacks cohesion","This book is more a series of vignettes or little snap shots of a dysfunctional family in Thornton, Louisiana than it is a novel or story. Vivid, the book evokes pictures of family cruelty and ruthlessness. The whole feel of the book is disjointed, lacking cohesion and feels more bitter than meaningful. This books is a disappointment compared to her other, the Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, which is peopled by the same characters (though is characterized nothing like them) and has more grace and redemption. Bypass this book in favor of Divine Secrets."
2,Wish I hadn't read this one at all,"I read Little Alters everywhere on recommmendation from a co-worker after reading Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. It almost ruined Divine Secrets for me. Incestuous Vivi is stomach churning. What was Miss Wells thinking? It's practically not the same Vivi-acious character. I recommend the second book highly, but this one...should be Vivi-sected."
4,Get over it!!!!,"I prefer this book over the hokier Yaya Sishood. I find its dark depiction of Vivi the child molester and the POVs of others besides whiny (grown-up) Sidda and vivacious Vivi of Divine Secrets fame refreshing. I cannot believe some recommend skipping this novel to protect the images of the Ya Yas they gleaned from reading the sequel. These are Wells' characters, and she has chosen to make them three-dimensional and complex. What's so offensive about that? If you truly loved the Ya Yas, you shouldn't be afraid to read this novel. In fact, I was relieved to discover the neglect and abuse that went uncovered in the Divine Secrets...druggie alchies are not always the bright, shiny French-spouting debutantes they appear to be. Merci, Rebecca Wells!!"
5,Loved it!,Love her characters and their ways of dealing with difficult subjects like alcohol abuse and family discord--not too seriously! Hope Wells is hard at work on another book about these people.
3,A sober story of a dysfunctional family,"I read the Divine Secrets first and throughly enjoyed it. Then I read Little Altars and was shocked to see how truly dysfunctional this family was. Vivi in Divine Secrets, while addicted to pills and drink, was at least a somewhat sympathetic character. She was totally hideous and unlikeable in Little Altars. I would be interested in knowing if the author plans on writing a third volume on the Walker family."
4,Soul Scraping Story,"Just finished LAE. At first, it read like a series of heartwarming stories about a nice childhood w/ some sauced parents. Suddenly, it all takes a very dark turn and this was a difficult transition. It became very depressing and dark. I enjoyed the writers wordsmithing. She is somewhat poetic. I will read DSOYYS because I hope to read that something good happens to these poor souls. Wells certainly managed to extract emotions from my gut (some that I would rather keep tucked away)."
5,"STARTED ON A PLANE, FINISHED IN MY HOMETOWN...","I started reading this book on a 10 1/2 hour flight from Los Angeles to London.I bought Little Altars Everywhere and The Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya sisterhood at the same time. I instinctively read Little Altars Everywhere first, which is the best way to read these two books.Vivi Abbott Walker is truly the star, the others must be content to simply be in her orbit. The minute you feel you know the characters, they totally surprise you. I really liked that. Also, the way you see the family through the innocent eyes of a child and the battle torn eyes of an adult is brilliant. Wish I could write like that!"
4,"Have not read ""Divine Secrets...""","I just read a few reviews and was intrigued and somewhat dissapointed by what many of those who have read ""Divine Secrets..."" have to say about ""Little Altars...""Yes, LA is hilarity interspersed with painful sadness, but so is life. That's what makes it such a wonderful book. So many of you seem upset that LA is ""darker"" than DS. For those of you who feel that way, I think you're missing something. LA did not leave me feeling depressed. It's all about what people go through, to get to the other side, and come out okay. There's nothing morbid about that."
1,The tone of the book changes too drastically...,"What begins as a light-hearted, predicatable story takes an unexpected twist mid-story without any transition. It was drudgery to finish."
3,Wanted a better Apertif...... But still a good read!,"Even though this book is supposed to be read before The Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, I read it afterward; like most folks. In any event, it was a good book and I recommend it, however....I was hoping for more insight. Again, I read it after the YaYas had already enveloped my psyche. I was a die hard YaYa and wanted more. This book, although very good on its own, made me feel like I still wanted more. And I'd hoped it would have answered more questions about ViVi, Shep, Sidda, and the lot.What I really like is that every family/friend/character had his/her own chapter. From that you could reason and view their own perspective of this wonderful family story."
1,Not worth my time.,"I did not like this book. I didn't find any of the characters to be very appealing. The fact that the mother sexually abuses her children gives me absolutely no motivation to read about her life and friendships in the second book, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Why glorify an alcoholic child-molestor?!!"
2,Confusing Characters,"After reading Diving Secrets all I can say is who is Vivi Walker? The character in this novel was a smoothed over version of herself in Little Alters, where she was represented as physically abusice, manipulative, and alcoholic. Here she is simply an overwhelmed mother left alone too often with four young children. Sure she breaks down, but this novel should also be about Vivi's reconciliation with her past, not only Sidda's. I was so disappointed with this novel"
2,A Huge Disappointment!!!,"I read and loved Divine Secrets of the Ya-Yas. It even brought back the memories of growing up with my two best friends. I was so excited to read more about the characters I grew to love in Little Altars, however when the darkest facet of Vivi's personality was revealed I wanted to through the book away. All of a sudden I didn't identify with these women any more. I felt disgusted with the rest of the book!!!"
3,Disjointed,"The plot of this novel is disjointed, like Lamb's This Much I Know Is True. The move from idyllic to horrific is too abrupt and aggravating. The authors should read Roddy Doyle's The Woman Who Walked Through Doors and Paddy Clarke. Altars is still a decent book, but not worth all of the hoopla."
2,ya-ya no,"After reading ""Divine Secrets"", the four lovable, ahead-of-their-times, Southern divas had a strong hold on me. I fell in love with these characters. I wanted to know what went on in Sidda's childhood to cause her such grief. I wish I hadn't have. Reading ""Little Altars"" presents on of the most depressing views of a dysfunctional family that I have ever encountered in literature. If you've already read ""Divine Secrets"", and are in love with Necie, Vivi, Caro and Teensy, do not read this."
4,This is a book you'll want to read non-stop!,"""Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel"" by Rebecca Wells is a great summer read. Wells does have a gift for many voices. I can understand why ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel"" was a #1 New York Times Bestseller over ""Little Alters Everywhere"", and why ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel"" was turned into a movie; it had a better plot and was more intriguing. Not the ""Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel"" didn't, but it left a lot of questions unanswered. And, in this novel, you don't get a great sense of Vivi. You know she is mentally unstable, but I think in Wells' follow up novel, it goes in much great and more interesting detail. I, personally think ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel"" should be read before ""Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel."" I recommend."
3,A Southern Perspective,"While the characters are not always likeable, the book is still engrossing. A tale of a family's trials and tribulations in smalltown Louisiana, this book is rich in Southern traditions and imagery. Wells is especially adept at sharing the perspectives of multiple characters as they cope with the challenges of daily life."
1,junk man!,"okay I read secrets of the ya ya sister hood first unknowing that it twas the second book in the series. I was VERY disappointed, I really didn't need a repeat of my childhood I mean jesus. I may seem a little cruel about this, but I just couldn't follow the stoey and even some parts didn't make sence to me at all. The characters were very generic, and I was at a loss when I began reading knowing that Siddalee Walker wasn't the main character of this novel too. It sadened me deeply, but I guess some books will do that. Hey If you read this Ms. Wells don't be angry with me, I'm just being honest about it. I thought the other book was much better."
2,Quite disappointing,"After reading ""Divine Secrets"", I was excited to read another of Wells' books. Unfortunately, this book falls short in many ways. The storyline is confusing and the characters are not developed in any redeeming way. I'll still give Wells another read when she decides to write another novel, but wouldn't recommend this one."
1,If you love the yahoo sisterhood-do not read this book!,"I read this book anticipating the enjoyment that I received when I read the ""Yahoo Yahoo Sisterhood."". It is written by the same author but has all the sadness of growing up in a childhood filled with alcholism & child abuse with very little humor within. The ""Yahoo Yahoo Sisterhood"" I passed to everyone to read & even bought as birthday presents! This book ""Little Altars Everywhere"" when I finished I threw in the garbage & told everyone do not bother reading."
4,"Wonderful Voice, Dark Story","Little Alters Everywhere shows the darker side of the ""Ya-Yas,"" demonstrating the consequences of frivolity and alcoholism, abuse, and racism. Characters that start out so fascinating and glamorous quickly devolve into a depressed and dysfunctional family. Wells successfully navigates many different voices, struggles, disappointments, horror, and forgiveness. Written with captivating southern charm she opens the the door to a nostalgic world that teeters on the edges of both bitter and sweet."
5,Twenty Years Later,"I bought and read this book based on recommendation from a good and trusted friend. Ever since hearing about it 15 years ago, I had always thought it was a book for girls and women, and that the Divine Sisterhood movie was a chick flick. All that may be true, but I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Little Altars and marvel at its insight and humor. I highly recommend."
3,Set over a 30 years period,"Luckily I read the DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA- YA SISTERHOOD first and loved it so bought LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE, which is a story set over 30 years.What a let down. It is good but no where near the level of DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA- YA SISTERHOOD I felt it was missing detail and I wanted more in it. I hoped it would have answered more questions about Sidda, Big Shep, Lulu and ViVi and others.Personaly skip this one go straight to DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD. What a read.!!!!!"
4,WARNING,I can tell you that the writer Rebecca Wells is very talented.This is a woman who knows how to write.But I found this bookvery disturbing.The incest part was very painful to read.I willnot be rereading this book any time soon.
2,"These are the same people as in ""Divine Secrets""?","After reading and loving ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"" I have to say I was very disappointed with this book. Wells' second book was much, MUCH better, because you get to see the characters at their best as well as their worst, which is all I felt like I saw in ""Little Altars Everywhere."" Although parts of this book are really moving and strongly drawn, many parts are slow or unconvincing, and the frequent changes of viewpoint are distracting. Also, you don't get to know each character well enough to really feel for them going through their painful experiences, especially since most of them don't give you any reasons to care, any hint of anything beyond self-involvement and self-pity."
4,A Prequel That Has Teeth,"I loved ""Ya Ya"" so much, I immediately went out to find this novel and read it. Equally as brilliantly written and captivating it is well worth the read. The only thing I found was that it changed my view of the characters in a way that is kind of upsetting. With ""Ya Ya"", I felt for the mother, I felt her life and struggles damaged her and made her the way she was, but that deep down she was a good mother and a loving mother that did her best with what she had emotionally. In ""Little Alters"" I had no love left for her character, not even a lot of like. She did inexcusable things that are only ever so slightly alluded to in ""Ya Ya"", and it changes your view.This book is fantastic, but, if you have fallen in love with the Ya Ya's as you percieve them in ""Ya Ya"", I reccomend NOT reading this book. I know that sounds strange, but, it's impossible to respect them the same way, to wish that you and your girlfriends will be them someday etc., when you read ""Little Alters""."
4,"Sad, Disturbing, Funny, Beautifully Written","Parts of this book made me breathless with its heart-breaking beauty. Parts made me laugh out loud. Parts have taken up their places in my mind and won't go away.Much of the content of this book is difficult, although it ultimately is about survival. Alcoholism, abuse, casual racism.Although many have called this book a novel, it is more a collection of related short stories told in various voices, most of which seem very authentic and real.Like many people, I read the 2nd book ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" first. This is a more difficult, less funny book, but it is a book worth your time."
3,Little Altars Everywhere,"Ms. Wells introduces us to the Walker family and various other players in the small town of Thornton, Mississippi. This book did not take me through the emotions that her second book The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood did. I couldn't wait to read this book and was somewhat dissappointed in the less than captivating story. I gained tidbits of information about characters I already knew and that helped me enjoy this book a bit. Ms. Wells has the gift to create wonderful characters and make them real to life. Every emotion that the characters feel is there for you to see and feel. Personally I missed the refreshing sense of humor that the second book displayed. I am glad that I read the book but could not say it keep me enthralled like this author's other work. Ms. Wells please give us more about this interesting group of lost souls but please remember that humor is often nature's balm to a bad situation."
3,Thought provoking book on intimacies and control,"Unusual and thought provoking novel written by Rebecca Wells. She allows the reader to part the curtains and have a peak at other peoples lives and their unique lifestyles. The chapters are written by different family members and friends allowing for an objective and subjective look at their experiences, both dark and brooding and some uplifting and fun, very reminiscent of the 60's . The control of a parent over their children, no matter their age, is quite disturbing and powerful. Overall the book was a good read and got better towards the end. Spanning over 30 years, this story is rich in tone and mood and takes a special writing talent to produce a saga that you feel can go on indefinitly."
1,Such a disappointment!,"Really loved Divine Secrets and was so excited to sit down and read Little Altars. Couldn't believe how bad it was. I read Divine Secrets in every spare minute I had, and got it finished in no time. I've had this book for 3 weeks now and have really had to struggle to get to the end. Wish I hadn't bothered. Restrict yourself to Divine Secrets and you'll be left with a wonderful 3 dimensional view of the Walker family and all the Ya Ya's. Read this and that image will be in tatters."
2,Rebecca Wells was not subtle enough with her setting names.,"My sister-in-law gave me this book, and I immediately began trying to identify the people and places of my hometown in Louisiana. Since I grew up in about the same time period as the setting of the novel, it wasn't difficult to begin identifying the characters. Ms. Wells should be very careful about revealing present day ""real life"" characters."
3,Little Altars,"""Little Altars Everywhere"" is a humorous and heart-breaking look further into the Walker family. Although not quite as good as ""Divine Secrets,"" it is an enjoyable read."
5,MUCH better than Divine Secrets,"Little Altars Everywhere is reminiscent of Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, but better. Divine Secrets was a huge disappointment, though."
4,"Good, but Divine Secrets was better","I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-ya sisterhood first, and loved it. This book was good, and I enjoyed it, but I was confused by the shift in many of the characters' personalities. The people I had come to love in Divine Secrets were suddenly quite different."
4,I'd say it was pretty good,"I liked this book a lot, but I found it quite depressing at times, especially towards the end. You found out all these secrets that you really didn't want to read about, like how Vivi abused her kids. I thought after learning that about her, it made her character seem so crazy and deranged. I thought the overall story was great, but the fact that Sidda's parents cared nothing about the kids, only about drinking and fighting, was rather saddening. I haven't read Divine Secrets yet, but I'm planning on it. I hope to get a better outcome after"
3,Duplicate Recording,Do not by this CD if you own Standing Room Only Or Re-Plugged Live They are all the same show Just Different packaging. Another way the record company's Make an extra buck
2,HF100 Vignetting,It works great EXCEPT that there's significant vignetting on the Canon HF100. I've used it on mine as well as my friend's with the same result.
4,Quite a helpful resource!,"I've been told that Lampe is THE lexicon to have if you're doing work with Christian Church Fathers. It doesn't necessarily have every word you'd need, but if used with the unabridged Lidell & Scott, you should be able to translate most patristic writings. If you have ability in Latin, the old Stephanus lexicon (about 10 times the size of Lampe) is helpful. I wouldn't suggest buying that one though, unless you happen to BE a library."
5,The best there is for Patristic studies,"I got this from amazon brand new when the price was down to 228 shipped. As of my writing this review it is back up to 313. I have noticed oxford press sometimes fluctuates there prices or amazon does. One or the other. You can also see my review of the Oxford English Dictionary 20 volumes that I got on sale at the same time. I haven't been able to use this lexicon yet. But I talked with those who are much farther ahead of me in this study, and this is the best. Sophocles is pretty much the only other option, but I haven't talked with any one that was really pleased or enthused with Sophocles."
2,Eh,"Nice leather product by Royce, but the visible snaps cheapen the appearance. They make others without the gold snaps showing and that would be the way to go."
2,Obsolete!,"Beware that this board is very old: the manual says ""Win 98"", ""Win 95"", .... I cannot get it to work on my ""XP"" system with on-board (integrated) video. If I left the ob-board video alone, the system would boot but I lost the video as soon as I logged into a user account. Disable the on-board video then I didn't have any display. My friend claimed if I updated the BIOS it would work. Except I had no idea how to do it if I could not get any display to work with. I had another AGP card that did give me the display with this card plugged in, but again, as soon as I tried to log in to do anything, the video disappeared shortly after the ""loading your personal setting"" message showed up.So, if you are a ""plug-and-play"" type or you are some one that needs a decent display before you can do any work, this card may not be for you."
3,for all those looking for drivers,"yes, the card is very old. ATI considers it a legacy product. diablotek is where you need to look for drivers as it's their card and they can be downloaded from their website.this card won't do all the aero type fancy stuff but it will get you a display..even with windows 7. i've done it myself. it works."
1,NO DRIVERS PAST XP AND THE CARD HARDLY WORKS,"The device works only with plug and play drivers, and has limited functionality with those. Basically this isn't worth the sand it was made from."
1,Did not work when arrived,"system did not accpet the card new from the box, sent it back with no issues"
1,Very Old Card,This is a very old card and does not come with Windows XP or Vista drivers. Good luck finding them. ATI considers this a legacy product.
4,"Well, I had no idea what i was buying.....But very fast shipment!!!","I thought 32mbs of memory was enough but it wasn't. Otherwise it was a wonderful purchasing experience, and it came way before they said it would, so I was very happy. It was my first purchase from amazon, and it won't be the last! Ant online has fast, inexpensive shipping too!"
2,Very small ad for China,"This is more of a charm than a keychain... If that's what you're looking for, buy away! However, the side of the shamrock that isn't shown has a relatively big stamp (not a sticker that can be removed) in the metal that says ""CHINA."" Not quite the Irish spirit I was looking for."
2,Not sure if it's sterling?,"This charm has a goldish tint to it that made me think maybe it wasn't authentically sterling, but it was stamped with 925, as well as a GIANT ""China"" imprint. Not very pleased with the color or the stamp."
3,tarnished,"i was so looking forward to getting this charm and starting my charm bracelet. i was most dissapointed with the quality of the charm. it was practically black from tarnish, not shiney like the picture shows and it is super tiny!!! very poor. but i guess you get what you pay for!"
2,junk,This item is awful! they have stamped the word China and a number into the face of the clover. who wants that?!
2,EXTREMELY SMALL CHARM,"I expected this charm to be much bigger and didn't think to check the measurements when it popped up as my search for a ""four leaf clover key chain."" It is EXTREMELY small. about the size of my finger nail. So if that is what you are looking for than this is the purchase for you. If you were looking for a key chain as I was don't waste your money. It barely fits on my key ring."
1,Too Small A Clover,"If the seller had been specific about the size of this item, it would have eliminated the need of returning it. And MADE IN CHINA stamped on the back of it? -- REALLY !"
4,Pretty good four-leaf clover charm,"It was as advertised and is pretty nice, but a little small and thin for what I was looking for. I'd like the ""made in China"" to be less prominent on the back."
3,Not his best,"I am a huge Richard Elliot fan, owning 12 of his cd's, but if you are looking to purchase a cd by him I would not recommend this one. It has good music on it but his other titles: Chill Factor, On the Town, Crush, and his newest Ricochet are much more enjoyable and you would be better off owning one of those titles."
5,Road trip!,Going down memory lane with Richard Elliot's music in balm to a weary soul after working a ten hour day!
2,THE BEST???,"Richard Elliot is a great musician with a distinguishable record of great albums, but to call this THE BEST, Well...not exactly. There is such a long list of much better tracks that would really make it worth calling it Richard's best. C'mon, Richard, you know you can do better than this!!!"
2,"A Testament to ""Smooth Jazz...""","...and frankly, that's not a compliment. Elliot = Taylor = James = Freeman = take your pick out of any number of other ""smooth jazz"" musicians...ie, glorified Muzak. Not that he's never done anything worth listening to, but don't we already have enough CDs for dentists' offices and hotel lobbies?If you're looking for yet another CD that of background stuff that doesn't merit paying too much attention to, this is pleasant enough. But if you're looking for something with some real ""meat"" to it, expect to be disappointed."
1,Fun but stupid,"This film is set in the sixties in Cadiz, Spain. Young medical students share a house and frequent a bar where they hook up with some prostitutes. The whores move in with them and rock their lives a bit. The boys end up contracting a venereal disease and all hell breaks loose. I found the film stupid because in reality, young boys from a good wealthy family would never glorify and worship worthless whores. In the end, the most conservative of the boys leaves his studies to become a doctor to be with one of the whores. Totally out of character. This made no sense. However, the music on this was pretty cool."
1,Beware!,"Before you order, you need to know these are plastic plates. They are NOT stoneware or quality plates. I did not see any references in the description of the plates that they were anything other than a natural plate. I now have to send back everything that I received, and the prices of these plates are priced the same as quality stoneware plates, such as Fiesta - which is what I intend on replacing them with, except I will go to a department store and purchase them - I wasn't expecting anything but quality platewear. Very disappointed in the lack of description on these plates.All I can say is if you're expecting a quality stoneware type of plate, this is not the one!"
2,"Flawed, what a waste.","I like the book BUT! I don't feel right about bringing it to school, or recomending it, because of the sex chapters. It would be better with out them. What a waste."
5,No doubt!,"The Boss is The Bomb. Yea, yea, the next album was ""chic"" and all that, and perhaps commercially her best seller. When they were in vogue, put anyone on a Chic groove and they sold by the truckloads, i.e. David Bowie, Sister Sledge, etc. Even Lady Madonna got some of their flavor. Having said all that, if you must own at least one Diana Ross album, it's got to be this one, hands down."
5,The Boss Indeed,"Written and produced by Ashford and Simpson, ""The Boss"" brought Diana Ross into a whole new ballgame musically of literate, sophisticated songs with a broad range of themes about independence, jealousy, pride of home, community, freedom and spirituality. Sounds heavy, yep, but the album is as light and shiny as they come. Sumptuous arrangements, a great beat, fabulous sound and reigning above all, Miss Diana Ross with wideopen vocals full of heart, soul and honesty. This album still shines like a star, even better remastered. It ranks right up with her latest opus, ""Every Day Is A New Day"" as the best of her career."
5,DIANA ROSS AT HER BEST!!,"Diana Ross has never sounded better and more self assured on any of her albums. The production by Ashford and Simpson is impeccable. Listen to Diana sing the title track and there is no doubt that she is still the Boss. The Ballads on the cd are also A-1. ""Sparkle"" and ""I'm In The World"" are standouts. Diana was at a point in her life when she wanted to take over her career and make her own choices, it shows on this cd."
3,Mildly Disappointing...,"I liked this one overall; there were some good birth stories, and I learned more than I expected to about the Amish. There was also some good insight into the hospital birth system.However, I was left a bit disappointed because I didn't feel the book was well-written in general. The story was often jerky and disjointed. To offer one example, when Penny went to Scotland for her nurse midwifery training, I wasn't quite sure what was going on. Wasn't she American? Why did she go all the way to Scotland? What, what? Some events just felt... random and not properly introduced.There were also quite a few lulls in the story; about 3/4 of the way through, I got bored and started skimming. I was expecting more birth stories, but there weren't too many.I would recommend checking this out from the library. And if you're looking for more birth stories and drama surrounding midwifery in general, check out ""Baby Catcher"" by Peggy Vincent."
3,A Midwife's Story,"Very interesting but would have liked more detail especially on the doctor's who ""boycotted"" the midwife idea at the hospital."
5,Loved it!,This book was difficult to put down. It is a remarkable story about a midwife's training and practice in a culture very different from her own. Reading this book made me want to train to be a midwife myself - and I will as soon as I complete my nurse's training.
3,I enjoyed it but...,"I felt the author was a little too uncritical of the Amish. Although she herself is not a member of the Amish faith, she seemed to have no questions about whether any of their customs might not be the best (ending their children's education at the eight grade for example, to insure the children will not question the Amish way of life). Instead, everything is perfect. And in fact, if mothers would just act like childbirth is no big deal, like the Amish do (doing housework while in labor--what virtue!!!) they would be much better off. While I enjoyed this book, and found it interesting and well written, I would have ejoyed a more balanced portrayal of the Amish lifestyle."
5,Enjoy cooking now!!,Finally a book that I could learn how to cook with and discover that cooking is actually enjoyable..so many great recipes and I am a picky eater!! A lot of the ingredients I already have..I cant say enough about this book..it saved me time and a lot of frustrations..thank you!!!
5,Exactly as described,"Item arrived in timely fashion. It was described as ""like new"", and it looked like it just came off of a store shelf. I am very pleased."
4,Good cookbook,"If you like to be in the kitchen a short time to prepare a good meal, this is the cookbook for you. country home body"
4,A SyFy movie that fits the bill,The SyFy Channel can come up with some Big creatures & this one is no different. If you like snakes &/or lizards this will please you. Who do you think would win if these two fought? It at least has a plot line & is a movie you can watch without thinking too much! Any Monster movie Sci-Fi fan would enjoy it. Not too much carnage so younger kids can at least watch it without a lot of blood & gore.
1,Just terrible,"First, they could have at least tried to make the animals look more alive and less plastic; even inexpensive CGI is better than this.Then the contents of the movie: Silly, unbelievable. Which even half lousy recon team goes in at night to an unknown island and then without nightvision goggles and constant communication with the extraction team? Who wrote this piece?This whole movie is full of impossible not even well played and worked out scenes. Waste of money, I think, would not recommend it to anyone.I like creature features but this is even unbelievable for kids."
2,Laughing vs. Cringing,"Well, first off, it's pretty obvious that the marketers for this less than good film thought that they could capitalize on the success of Alien vs. Predator. With the ""snazzy"" KVC on the disc. I hate to tell them, but the film is mis-named as it is. It's really a bunch of bad actors vs. bad CGI of a komodo dragon and a cobra. Who wins, who loses? Well, the viewer loses. That's for sure.The aforementioned bad actors run around, alternately going after the monsters and running for their lives. They shoot countless bullets, including maybe 30 or so from a 15-round magazine gun...this happens more than once. I can't really complain about that, though. We see inaccuracies like that all the time.Anyway, overall a pretty bad movie. Only a few interesting scenes. And I believe Michael Pare was asleep for most of the filming."
3,"Its ok, ill give it that...","Well, giving this film as much credit it deserves, i say it gets about a D average. Some acting good, most bad. The CGI on the snake was... well, suprisingly acceptable, but they didn't get the komodo down very well. The feet on the komodo dragon looked so stupid... the toes didn't move at all through the whole thing... but, what do you expect.But hell, at least the cover looks cool for a DVD collection, i say check this one out if you have a high toleration for bad acting and cgi effects, you just might enjoy it."
1,oh.........my...........god...........,"this movie is sssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad every time some 1 swears this ridiculous ""squak"" sound attemps 2 cut it out and since this is a (completly stupid) seequal 2 ""curse of the komodo"" they got some of the origonal actors from ""COTK"" (curse of the komodo)and got them 2 play different characters in ""kvc"" (komodo vs cobra)!!!!!!!!!!!They also stole lines and scenes from ""COTK"". The actors spend half the time shooting at the monsters ( witch look ssssssssooooooo fake)when they should be running away!!!!!!!!! It doesent even connect with ""COTK"" THIS FILM SHOULD BE RATED ""R"" FOR RIDICULOUS, OR SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING LABLE SAYING , WARNING: EXTREMLY CRAPPY!!!!!AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!! AVOID!!AVOID!! AVOID!!"
4,"IN THIS CORNER-KOMODO, IN THIS CORNER-COBRA...","Well. I have to admit that I am the first one to enjoy a nature runs amok epic. I love big critter movies so when I get 2 big critters I'm in scifi heaven. Is this cheesy? of course, as a cheese lovers pizza. Is it fun...you bettcha! This isn't oscar whoha. This is action, adventure and really bad overacting! But people get ate! Yippee! And lets face it, the final fight sequence is more realistic than Stallone's new Rocky film. Sit back and enjoy. A great way to kill a rainy day."
2,AND THE WINNER IS...,"Ready for another CG-laden movie about genetic experimentation gone wrong? Well, here's KOMODO VS. COBRA, a rather misleading title since the climactic battle at the end is left unresolved. But, this movie isn't as bad as it could have been. The effects aren't superlative but they're not bad for one of these quickie flicks. Michael Pare sleepwalks through his role as the ex-military captain whose services as a boat commander are solicited by environmentalists out to expose the wicked treatment of animals on a remote South Pacific island. Along for the ride, naturally, is an ambitious tv journalist out to make the ""big story"", and you know that most of the cast will end up as appetizers for the monsters, but that's what you expect in these kind of films. If you're a fan of giant monster movies, this one's okay."
1,Komodo vs Cobra,This movie is a big joke! Its so obvious the Komodo and Cobra are computer animation rather than real creatures (they look very fake). But its hilarious to watch the actors screaming and running away from the animated creatures like as if they were real. Storyline? I was so busy laughing I didn't realise there was one!! haha
3,Glori-Anne got slurped!,"I recently picked up a copy of KOMODO VS. COBRA at my local video store and was pleasantly surprised to discover that Glori-Anne Gilbert was in the cast. But I was disappointed that she never took her top off (that's gotta be a first!) and astounded when she got slurped by a giant Komodo Dragon! What an icky fate for such a lovely lady!Any way, the movie is not very good. The acting, the CGI, and story are only average. Still I gave it 3 stars because of Glori-Anne's appearance and Michael Pare's 60 shooter. At one point, I counted up to sixty shots that he had fired from that hand gun of his without reloading....and he was still firing when I lost count! Amazing! Does anybody know where I can get one of those things?"
2,Expedition with Chonograph Review and The Watch Zone Company Complaint,"I purchased this watch for a male. The face of the watch appears to be larger than it actually is. This is predominatly an athletic female watch.Furthermore, upon wishing to return the item, I noted the seller (The Watch Zone) charges a $10.95 restocking fee. Not worth buying from this company, when competitors have the watch for only a few more Dollars and guarantee your satisfaction. Also, there were no instructions for the watch in the box and so you are doomed to push buttons like a child until you can figure out the mechanism. Again this is a company problem."
3,Meh,"Meh probably sums up this watch. There is nothing wrong with it but it isn't great either. When it arrived it was much smaller than I expected (almost like a childrens watch) and the compass on it is tiny. On the positive side, I wear it camping and it has survived a good few knocks and some light rain. No bad, not good, just ok."
2,Doesn't beep,"The watch works fine, but it does not make any sounds for the alarm, the hourly chime, or any other function I would expect it to. I suppose I could get that fixed, but it doesn't seem to be worth the trouble, given that the watch is inexpensive. This doesn't bother me all that much because I do not depend on those functions in my daily life, and I definitely do not want it to chime every hour. I'm sure I just had the bad luck to get a rare defect, but I did."
4,Very good,"The first thing that impressed me about this CD was the excellent sound quality. These recordings are often so obviously digital and/or fake. This does have some great animal sounds on it and does make you feel like you're wandering around in a shouthern marsh at twilight. Though in reality, that is scary and not pleasant like this CD is! Hearing a gator growl is not something you'd actually want to experience! I like to read to this recording. Good, unintrusive background noise. Very nice."
3,No Power Needed,"I have been doing yoga for several years and own approximately 10 videos. This reminds me of a Jane Fonda aerobics video gone modern. For practioners wanting to reap the relaxation/flexibility benefits of Yoga, you will NOT find it here. This video serves as a mild workout, great to energize you for the day. It does not concentrate on breathing. Poses are held for short periods of time and not very advanced. It does offer a ""less advanced"" option to the poses. I am giving this a three rating because of the ab workout towards the end of the video; which is its only redeeming quality!"
1,Poor instruction on proper form,"I'm experienced in yoga and was very suprised that the instructors would call out the name of a position and give no advice on proper technique. Not only is this a little dangerous, but it could prevent a novice from getting the full benefits of the workout. The instructor does the same with ballet and pilates positions, which I am less familiar with.So, it is an agressive workout but it might not be a good idea for someone who doesn't know proper form to use this tape."
2,Not a DVD quality effort,"OK, you could go for this DVD version for thomas fans to save the endless rewinds and so on that you get to go through with a tape, but the resolution was extremely poor, and came through with lots of grainy blurred white spots etc. like a really old and worn out video tape!!! Of course the content is as good as the video, but this is not what one expects from normally crystal clear DVDs!!!"
4,I love Thomas and this new DVD!,"Finally, Thomas the Tank Engine stories on DVD. (thank you!) Everything looks and sounds great, but you do have to watch all the Thomas commercials before getting to the menu. As for the extra stuff on the DVD, the games are fun and very easy for me. I like the songs on the bonus music CD, but why only *four* songs? Thomas has lots of songs I would love to listen to while playing with my Thomas train set. Still, if you're a Thomas fan like me, you'll love watching this over and over and over again. (peep, peep!) :-)"
1,Disappointed,"The dvd came on time. But it was NOT in ""acceptable condition"" as stated.It was so badly scratched and not at all viewable. Plus the dvd was not secureinside the package."
4,America's number 1# engine,"Let me start of by saying that viewer selected doesn't mean they have to be great. Thomas's first ever episode Thomas gets Tricked wasn't even in it. I thought Better Late than Never, Thomas comes to Breakfast, Thomas Breaks the Rules, and Thomas and Bertie's Great Race were far better than some of these like Thomas and Stepney or a New Friend for Thomas. Were they really that good. Thomas was barely in both of them. Thomas meets the Queen didn't excalty focus on Thomas. Are these viewers really stupid becasue these epiodes weren't great. And I really think they shoulda kept the Ringo Starr narrations."
2,Thomas = great; DVD = stinks,"We love Thomas, his stories, the lessons, the whole package. The stories are great, but the DVD stinks, why: (1) grainy film used looks worse than VHS we have, (2) horrible chapters / editing for DVD, (3) cuts out episode ends/transitions showing different characters from VHS edition, my kids loved these clips. Keep with the VHS!"
1,Enough of the commercials!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought the DVD version and I have to have my child sit through a five minute long boring commercial EVERY TIME we watch the video. I was upset that the skip, fast foward and menu options were disabled during this commercial. I took it back and bought VHS."
1,WARNING: read this before you buy,"The DVD has a terrible amount of advertising that you're forced to watch before you can see any of the Thomas stories. It's advertising other Thomas products, so it's actually interesting the first time through. But you'll be forced to watch the advertising EVERY time you play this. Other DVDs are programmed so you can jump straight to the menu and skip the advertising. Not this one.Once you run the advertising gauntlet and earn the right to watch videos, they're excellent as always. But given that all the Thomas collections are excellent, you should buy something other than this one."
4,A nice collectable toy,I had just gotten this within 4 business days from paying for it. Which I thought was really fast because it came before the expected delivery date. I say if your a huge Naruto fan who loves both the good and bad guys. This item is worth to buy. It's a good toy to put on your dresser or bookself.
2,low pickup,"I purchased this for my husband, He said it had almost no power to hold the screw in place. He followed the very sparse instruction on the package, and tried several times, After having no luck, He threw it in the trash."
2,Well...,"I had to read this for my AP English class and I probably wouldn't have continued to read it after the first couple of pages if it hadn't been required.While this is a very well written book, conducted in an entertaining but also informative method, it tended to be a bit boring. The names of the Gods and Goddesses seemed to be innumberable and impossible to pronounce unless you've had some previous learning of the Greeks or Romans. Furthermore, since it was difficult to find out how to say their names, it made it difficult to remember them!However, a few of the stories were fun to read, and other were humorous. Also, the stories were written with simplicity; it would be feasible for a middle-schooler to read just as it would be for high-school and beyond.As far as mythology goes, and to it's inherent barrier of excitement, Hamilton did well."
2,not my type,"I thought this book was so boring. I had to force myself to read it. I had to read it for school, i had to end up finding the summary so i wouldn't have to read the rest.I know that its considered a classic, i guess this was seriously not my type of book. I give it 2 stars because it could have been worst."
2,Bestseller?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!,"I had to read this book for my highschool literature class. Now I enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year. This book put me to sleep. The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Trojan War chapter which I wished was longer. It was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading, unlike the rest of the book. I only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that don't waste your time."
1,Booring!!!!!!,This is one of the most booring books i have ever read! ONLY read it if you are forced to for school...Why is this book considered a classic? Got me!
1,about 500 pages of boredom,"Mythology. Sounds great right? I beg to differ. This book describes way too many Greek myths with unnecessary detail. It was about 500 pages of boredom, but if I had to pick a favorite part, it would be the part about the Trojan War. It was the most well-written and I found it interesting. There are so many myths, each with an individual main idea, that it would be impossible to describe all of them, so I won't. The author probably wrote so many myths to better inform the reader about Greeks and their history. Even so, she could have made it a lot more exciting. Overall I didn't like this book at all, but I would still recommend it to kids who like mythology and don't mind a boring book. A measly 1 star. -- Abby"
2,Not what I was looking for...,I was looking for a book that detailed all of the stories of Greek Mythology. This book attempts to but gets lost with too much jumping around from one story to another and between Greek and Roman Mythology. I felt that this book was difficult to follow and didn't really keep you interested enough to try.
5,Big Thumbs Up,"A must read if you enjoy Greek mythology. Hamilton presents each character in both their Greek & Roman titles so you can cross-reference from the various mythology books out there. It's an easy read, and very enjoyable."
2,Like reading a student's summary,"This is not what I remembered as the mythology: the rich and fascinating stories I had read when I was a child.This book is a very dry, summary of the mythology. Boring. Fails to involve the reader or to stir any emotions. ""Hercules did this and then he did that...Yawn...Yawn again...""It looks like a (poor) effort on behalf of a (bored) student to summarize it for the coming high-school exam.Thus: If you are preparing for such an exam - this may be the book for you. If on the other hand, you expect a pleasurable reading experience - find a better alternative."
5,Everything you ever wondered about,Extremely well written to the degree owned it years ago lost it researched and found rereleased now own New Copy !!enough said
4,Love the book,Love the book. If your looking for details about mythology this book is for you. The book is sometimes overly descriptive. But enjoy this kind of literature.
5,pretty good,"I would have to say that this is a pretty good mixture of mythology. Not only Greek but Roman too. Very glad with this purchase. If you want more than a little poem about Hercules or any other hero or god get this book. A lot more through than the Percy Jackson series, which are a good intro but if you want depth get this book."
5,A wonderful collection of myths,The book exceeded all expectations. Mythology is easy to read and understand in this collection. The book was in brand new condition and I know that my daughter has exactly what she needs for school!
4,Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes by Edith Hamilton,"I had to read up on Greek mythology over the summer for my Sophomore English two honors class. This book was wonderful in giving me exactly what I needed to know about each story and character required on my list. And besides that, it was very interesting and entertaining!"
4,"A fine book for reference, but woefully lacking in spirit.","Perhaps spirit is the wrong word. It is obvious by the late Miss Hamilton's writing that she harbors quite an affinity for the Grco-Roman/Norse myths and cultures. However knowledgeable and talented she is at non-fiction and discussion, the actual tellings of the myths emerge as dull and tedious. If the prospective reader is looking for a thorough and well-crafted reference guide with brief recounts of the myths with little poetry or other flairs for the dramatic, this book is a fine choice. On the other hand, if one wants a reference guide that is entertaining as well, they will be more satisfied with ""Bulfinch's Mythology"" as long as it has an index and glossary. If the reader desires not reference but pure entertainment value, and does not wish to read translated Homer, Virgil, Ovid, etc., I suggest ""Gods, Heroes, and Men of Ancient Greece,"" by W.H.D. Rouse. The book is written as a storyteller would deliver the myths."
2,use it as a resource,"As a long-time student of mythology, I was generally disappointed with this book. It hardly appreciates the richness of Greek mythology; Hamilton rather plods through the stories in Greek mythology (the book ought to be called ""Greek and Roman Mythology,"" as it is mostly stories from ancient Greek culture, and its imitators, the Romans), except for that last chapter on Norse mythology. The only useful parts are the introductory chapters, which provide a nice overview of the themes of Greco-Roman mythology, how it came about, brief bios of major writers, etc, and the genealogical tables at the back of the book. For a better introduction to mythology, and a book that encompasses more than Greco-Roman mythology, read Michael Macrone's ""Brush Up Your Mythology."""
5,Great Reference Guide,"I am a student of English, and a favorite subject of mine is Classical Mythology. I find myself going back to this book time and again for most of my research needs on the subject. I was first introduced to mythology through this book. The clear descriptions sparked an intrest. I have read the book several times, and at every reading it is new and fresh. If you are a student doing research or a person who just wants to find out about Mythology, this book is for you."
3,It's a good book,"This book is GREAT, and most excellent in its covering of the Greek and Roman myths, but I found that the information on the Norse myths to be sadly lacking. Overall, the book is good to own, but if you're looking for Norse mythology, buy something else."
4,Ride On The Wind,"This really is one of the best books out there on myths. The one problem I had though is that I found it a little complicating to understand. I had to read it a couple of times to get the full picture. However, it really is a good read. More then likely should be used as an introduction."
2,To Vague for My Liking.,"Can't say I enjoyed this book. I only read it for school, but normally I enjoy reading books or Greek/Roman History. The error in this book was that too much information was covered in so too few of pages. I know that may seem strange as the book is 350 pages, but the author tried to cover ever aspect of Greek and Roman Mythology and Literature. His writing style became to plain and ended up reading like a teenage girl was describing it. It came out like:Zeus sleep with Lady 1. Lady 1 had Son 1. Hera killed Lady 1. Son 1 love Lady 2. Lady two had 3 girls and 1 son. Zeus slept with one of the girls... and so on.Yes that is a simplification of how the book read, but I think it gets my point a cross. This book worked a a great refresher for information I already knew. In that fact it did succeed. I feel if you don't already know Greek/Roman Mythology it will leave you lost or wanting to read a different book to fill in all the holes."
4,NAPAHIGH STUDENT million word report,"Mythology by Edith Hamilton is a wonderful book for anyone who loves the stories of gods and heroes as much as I do. After not studying the Greek and Roman myths for about two years in school, I thought I had lost my love for the stories. But, when I read this book about the stories of myth and ledged, my mind is once again filled with awe and wonder. Reading about how people in ancient Greece and Rome explained how things happened, such as with Hera and Argus and how the peacock got it's eyes, and with Demeter and Hades and how the seasons began, is a truly wonderful reading experience. However, there are so many different stories in this book, it starts to become hard to tell one from the other. That is one thing I disliked about the book Mythology. True, they were separated and placed into categories, but I felt like there were to many stories/legends crammed into one book. However, over all it was a truly wonderful book."
4,Very Pleased,"This book arrived in great condition, packaged in a ziplock bag and was very clean. It arrived exactly as I would expect for paying for the expedited delivery. Would use this seller again."
5,Great for all ages,"What I found pleasantly surprising about this book is that it is easily understood, yet a very viable source of ancient Greek mythology. Great for all ages if you are interested at all in Greek mythology."
2,Grain of Salt,"While it is certainly true that Edith Hamilton is a standby in the field of Classics, her telling of myths must be taken with a grain of salt. A product of her time and education, she has a tendancy to try and force a quasi-Christian mythos on Greek legends ie a Savior figure being slain and resurrected. Although this is a good introduction, particularly for younger folk, it should be viewed as a springboard and no more. It is easy to read, and relatively well laid out, but anyone with a serious interest in Greek mythology and mindset should look elsewhere for a truer understanding and appreciation, one that does not force or contrive Christian parallels."
2,Mythology,"ISBN 0316341142 - Mythology is a bit like Pokemon to me - I can't remember all those names and I certainly can't remember who's got what powers. I had hope that this book would help me start to remember at least some of it, but it seems to have made things a little worse.Author Edith Hamilton retells various Greek and Romans myths, in her own words. Most gods are referred to by both names which, at least for me, only adds to the confusion. On top of that, Hamilton's writing style doesn't appeal to me. I had to read and re-read sentences, not because they were complex and confusing but because my mind would actually wander in the middle of sentences - not a good indicator.Clearly, mythology is a matter of taste, but if you're anything like me - a bit ignorant on the topic and trying to correct that - this book is a good reference, something to open and rely on for info, but not a good read.- AnnaLovesBooks"
3,Not quite as expected...but decent,"Very good book on a basic guide to ancient mythology, but I was disappointed to find out how basic it was. I like how it seemed the author was mixing Greek, Roman, Nordic, and other ancient mythologies together... However, this book seems to stick to Greek and Roman and barely touch on Nordic, and the other mythologies might as well have been deleted they tell so little. Certainly not a bible for mythology at all!Overall I learned a little, and it was interesting, none-the-less. I don't feel cheated, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,easy to read over-view of greek and roman mythology,"I'm actually reviewing the 1969 edition of this, which was a very well organized and informative introduction to most of the characters of greek/roman mythology. Broken into easy parts to read and interestingly written accounts of their tales"
4,An Excellent Overview,"Edith Hamilton offers a great overview of Greek mythology. It is written in simple language and is easy to comprehend. The stories are presented with continuity and the connections between heroes from different myths is shown. She offers good summaries and overviews of the major stories including the Battle of Troy and Odysseus' journey home. She does a good job of tying the mythology surrounding events into the events.This is a beginners book and not a full account of most of the stories. She does site the sources for each of the stories so you could further your own research if you were so inclined.A leisurely read, recommended for youths or anyone looking to fill in the gaps and connect the dots in their knowledge of Greek myths."
3,Good Book,"This book is great for young people or beginner, but I do not recommend it to people with more than a passing interest in Mythology. The stories are well written but very brief. ""The Trojan War"", ""the Adventures of Oddyseus"" and ""The Hunt for the Golden Fleece"" were long when compared with the other stories, but still short, though very well written.The chapter about the norse mythology was completely unnecessary. A bit was written about Odin and a summary of the story of Signy and Sigurd.This book made me bacome interested in mythology, so buying is not a complete waste of money. It's cheap and it's interesting for beginners.Quite good!"
4,not bad for required reading,"I had to read this book for humanities 9 in high school and its really good, especially for a required reading. The way the story is explained is excelled and easy to follow, except that i am horroble with names, especially forign ones so of course i had troube following, but if you can catch on to the names, you will have an enjoyable read"
3,Can be boring at first,"The first couple chapters are boring, do not hold much attention. One must focus in order not to fall asleep. Once past those chapters things get interesting. You might have an issue putting it down."
4,a pretty good book,I had to read this book for my 9th grade Enighish class i thought it would suck but it got kinda intersting and it was a pretty good book for a into to mythology!!!!!!!!
1,A Teacher's Opinion of the Text,"MYTHOLOGY is the text I was given when I first started teaching my mythology class for juniors and seniors. Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Not only does Edith Hamilton blandly summarize every story, but she leaves out many of the details that students are eager to absorb. Although I have great respect for the text since it was one of the first to bring Greek myth into an easily-accessible form, it is dated and a poor text for a high-school mythology class. Some teachers argue that the elevated language and confusing sentence structure is good practice for serious students, and it is in other contexts. But I am of the opinion that mythology should be fresh and exciting--as it was to the original myth-makers. As Thomas Bulfinch had said, ""Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study, but as a relaxation from study."" When a text makes its subject nearly impossible to appreciate, it's not worth it."
1,Unfaithful to the sources,"Hamilton's writings on Classical mythology are very easy to read, and give the general reader an intoductory view of the different myths. However, she was NOT faithful to the sources, and quotes them with many mistakes. While the book may serve as an easy and pleasant introduction, whoever wants to read about the subject and have the correct information, should NOT read this book."
4,Explaining Percy Jackson,"I bought this for my 8 year old son who has become infatuated with thePercy Jackson pbk 5-book boxed set (Percy Jackson and the Olympians)and so I felt the need to give him a good reference to use for background on all the mythology used. Although Hamilton's book is a bit over his head, he and I are able to go through the stories together, and it's written in a way that does a great job of explaining how these characters came about and why they are how they are. It's a great reference tool, and the stories are amazing in their own right. It covers everything and makes it easy to understand. Great buy."
4,An old classic that belongs on the reference shelf.,I bought this to answer questions and settle arguments about Greek and Roman mythology in various word-based game forums. It is a classic and a standard reference. It does little with any mythology of non-mediterranean people.
3,Mythology,Too brief a summary. Nothing about Sisyphus or Damocles . Ok for a taste of Greek mythology as resource of many sayings in English.
1,lasted about a month,"Placed tide clock on sailboat. Paper dial fell apart and stopped working in about 60 days. Plastic and paper construction and way overpriced,"
4,LONGARM OF JUSTICE,"Marshall Custis Long continues to catch the bad guys and love the more-than-willing ladies. This is #329 in the Longarm series and held my attention as did many of the others. Don't expect great thought-provoking literature here...what you get is good old entertainment and adventures, and the ""man"" that can handle anything as it comes along - one moment a gunfight or a barroom brawl, and the next to loving a gorgeous woman. In this one, he finds himself waking up in Arizona next to a very dead redhead, and all his identification papers are gone. Because he is Longarm, he will prevail. A good yarn for a fun romp through the Old West (if it ever existed)."
3,"A jazzy, uneven swan song","""Melting Pot"" was the MG's last album with their original classic line-up (Steve Cropper, Booker T. Jones, Duck Dunn, Al Jackson). It's basically them stretching out in the studio. The songs are longer than usual and the style is jazzier than on any of their previous records. The song ""Melting Pot"" is great but the other tracks aren't nearly as memorable and some verge on funky Muzak and are almost instantly forgettable. This is an album that completists will want but that newcomers should avoid."
3,"A Brief Survey of World History from a French Perspective, Circa 1963","Braudel writes well in French and the English translation is excellent. If you are looking for a comprehensive world history with great detail and thorough research, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a decent general survey of history written by a Frenchman during the height of the Cold War, then this is your book. Africa and the Americas don't get a lot of text and what little they get is extremely biased and fundamentally inaccurate, even for the time. I actually learned something new about East European, Russian and Indian history from this book."
3,This book brought me to a land of confusion,"This book is a mixed bag, and I find myself explaining this book in two ways. I loved the sheer amount of information this book expounds upon, but was often confused by the manner in which it does so. It often seems that every other sentence jumps to a completely new idea, leaving me in a state of, sorry to say, ""WTF?"" The layout is confusing as well, and the coherence is lacking in a large degree. I gave this book three stars only because of its potential. The only time I would recommend this book would be to a college humanities class where the professor can go over the book piece by piece."
1,Agh!,"I read this bookk when it was just published, years and years ago. Then, I was young and silly, and thought that the book was, well, so so. Now at 70 y.old.amd woth my Ph D., I read it again, now in English and I think it is really vomiting. It does not have any profondity, no insight into historical events, it skips names that ""made"" history,he jumps, like a grasshopper, from one century (!) to another without warning, his text is full of quotations with few original material. His conclusions, of each chapter, are so wrong that you doubt if he really ever went -as he says- to all the places he claims he did. What a waste of money, paper and ink.It made me sick.I hope you take it out from your listsCordially,Eugenia"
1,"West Africa gets the short end, yet again...","Very poor analysis of West African civilizations. For example, Ghana was a very significant Soninke empire in Western Africa, yet barely any attention at all is paid to it. To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been ""founded by whites from the North"". Fact is, there were no ""whites"" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race ""browns""."

5,What does it say on your shirt?,"Some records are so perfect there's not a second you'd want to fade or edit out. This was my introduction to Waymore, many years ago. I had the good fortune to discover him via someone who had a number of his records so it was a real eye-opener to find a singer I'd never heard of with a back catalogue of such high quality. I love the record for a number of reasons: the voice; the musicians; the songs, but more than anything else it was memorable for showing me a country band could SWING. It's not rock or blues or jazz but it has it's own feel and, of course, caused me to check out the likes of Bob Wills - not exactly a household name in the United Kingdom. Waylon was making good records til he died, but he never improved on this. Wonderful."
5,If You Have Just One Country Album...,"This should be it.Brian Wilson has Pet Sounds, The Beatles have Sgt Peppers - and Waylon has Dreamin My Dreams.The songs are strong, the arrangements are tight, and the sound is gutsy, warm and robust - all at the same time.Getting into Waylon is not easy, because there are dozens of Best Of Cds available, and many are filled with his own version of C&W; standards, plus duets and combinations with Willy Nelson and others.On Dreamin My Dreams, he masters the album as a piece of music in its own right, not simply as a collection of songs.The CD is wonderfully re-mastered, so the sound is crystal clear. ""Bob Wills is Still the King"" never sounded so good.But again, this isn't an album of individual highlights; rather, it's a celebration of a guy who travelled in the world in many more ways than one, and though his journey is now over, his catalogue is immense, and this CD stands as his opus magnus."
3,Not for the light of heart,"This album says Everclear, but after they've vandalized a couple cars, dranks 37 beers a piece and dumped their girlfriends. Classic themes, but just a little overdone in the rage department. Not enough there to justify it. One real gem on the album is ""Rock Star."" Listen to the rest after you've have the worst day of your life."
1,am I crazy or did people actually like this?,first off...let me say I am a huge everclear fan. I've seen them live plenty of times and love every record they put out. That said...I've listened to this record twice and tried my hardest to like it....but after two attempts...I sold it back..the songs don't make any sense to me...they have no flow and just basically sound like noise I could make in my basement....after seeing all of the positive reviews I feel someone has to take the other side of the debate
4,Finally back to the old school,"I am glad to see that Everclear has finally gone back to the type of music they started with. This album reminds me of Sparkle and Fade or So Much For the Afterglow. Everclear did a lot better with the 'hard' stuff then the happy-go-lucky music of Vol. 1. If your a fan, you'll love this CD."
3,Lost something since Afterglow,"I've been an Everclear fan ever since I memorized their ""So Much for the Afterglow"" cd. These two new ones, Songs from an American Movie Vol. 1 and 2 are good but they don't have that adolescent angst that caught me in Afterglow. Wonderful on vol1 is the only track that gets close to the feeling that I fell in love with but otherwise it's all new stuff to me. I like both vol1 and vol2 but not nearly as much as I loved Afterglow"
3,Ick,"I got this CD and listened to it, finally deciding that this seems to be some truly uninspired music. It's definitely going to be darker, but the CD just doesn't seem like it comes together like Vol 1 did. Some of the loops just have an uncanny resemblance to Dreamcast games. Rock Star's beginning drum intro sounds like the intro to Crazy Taxi, and the main chord line from When It All Goes Wrong Again resembles the chord line for NFL2K. It really flattens the CD. Vol 1 was much better, and So Much For The Afterglow is better than Vol 2. Everclear gave me a let down on this CD. Would I buy it after listening to it? Probably not."
5,This is a great CD!,"If you're looking for a CD that has great rock and some soft tunes too, this CD is for you. Everclear's CD ""Songs From An American Movie Vol. 2: Good Time For A Bad Attitude"" has gone back to their old kind of music. If you've heard Everclear's old music and liked it, you should pick up this ablum, too. Don't let the Parebtal Advisory sticker fool you. It's only one song that has most of the bad words, and they explain about the song, that they are only expressing their feelings about certain things. They're not trying to be cool by cursing. You could always get the clean version, though. Either way, it's a great album."
4,A Wonderful Follow Up Album,"I bought Volume One:Learning How to Smile with high hopes and big expectations, and I was happily surprised. It was a wonderful album, one of my favorites. I was quite sure that Good Time for a Bad Attitude could never even come close.Then I popped it into the CD playerAt first listen, I was dissapointed...it was so different from Volume One and I had been hoping for more of the same. Then, I threw all of my preconcieved notions aside and listened to it as what it was, a great album. They up the ante on this one, making the distortion louder and the lyrics meaner until suddenly I wasn't quite sure how I could ever think it wasn't worth my money.This is one to be bought."
3,Eh,"I have to start out by saying that everclear is my favorite band, and has been for a good six years now. I read these reviews of people saying 'it's just like sparkle and fade' or 'everclear's getting to the top.' no offense to those of you who wrote these things, but everclear is running out of juice. they still manage to do some good things like 'overwhelming,' but it's nowhere near the levels they were at with 'so much for the afterglow' and 'sparkle and fade.' if you want the real, true everclear rocking out, pick up 'world of noise.' again, this isn't a bad cd, but it's far from everclear's best."
1,The worst packaged band of the last seven years,"Ahh well Everclear the masters of three chords, entire songs containing five words or less and disguising one song as a whole albulm, wait no, a whole career have done it again. Exactly. I thouhgt people would stop listing to these guys about '95 but I have to hand it to the brilliant ""artists"" at Everclear and of course there even more sly record producers and radio ""pushers"" who keep selling this trash over and over again to the rebelent youth masses. Congrats. And if your a ""real"" fan dont worry Im sure this group will have a long and healthy career producing the same sounding songs for years to come."
5,VOL. 2 ROCKS!!,"Ok, I love Everclear, I had to get this CD right when it came out. It's so cool. I have been hearing the song ""When it All Goes Wrong Again"" on the radio before the album came out, and I really liked it. This CD has more of a rock edge than ""VOL. 1 Learning How to Smile"". But, I like it. I would definitely recommend this album to Everclear fans, and I would recommend it to anyone. It's a fun CD. It is not a disappointment."
3,Not as melodic as Vol.I,"I understand this is more a return to form for Everclear, but I did prefer the more melodic sounds on Volume I. That being said there are a number of worthy songs here. ""Short Blond Hair"" about what really is not important anymore, ""Out of My Depth"" a tuneful look at despair, and ""Overwhelming"" which may prove to be wishful thinking but is a valiant effort to show the pain of a relationship gone wrong are all excellent examples of the band in top form.But some other tunes are pretty much a waste of time. Like ""Babytalk"" that is pretty much a hard rocker about a pet peeve, and ""Rock Star"" an idea that has been done to death and usually better than this one. And even the title ""Misery Whip"" makes me wince. I just feel Volume I was more consistently listenable."
4,Excellent CD filled with great riffs & melodies...,"This album is harder than volume 1, but it's not nearly as good. That being said, it's still an excellent CD filled with great riffs & melodies. Everclear is one of the few hard rock bands today that can write a great hook."
4,Everclear rocks out,"Everclear throws out another album hot on the heels of Volume One, and this album is for the serious Everclear fans who loved their older album Sparkle and Fade. This has some definate rock in it (Unlike the pop of Volume One) and the maturity of Everclear shines through. This is a serious album, almost the opposite of Volume One."
4,"Great, just not Sparkle & Fade","Vol. 2 is a great album from Everclear. Anyone can tell that this cd was produced with a lot of care and effort, but is that Everclear? In my opinion, no. Don't get me wrong, it truely is a great cd, but Sparkle & Fade and World of Nois are a lot better, so far. I have listened to Vol. 2 like 30 times already today, and it definitely has a harder sound to it. I just don't like some of the songs really as much as others. Songs like ""Thee Good Witch of the North"" and ""Misery Whip"". These two songs could eventually become my favorites, just not now. That's just my two cents."
4,Great Album,"i'm a new everclear fan, so i haven't really heard much of their old stuff. i've read that this album was more like sparkle and fade, so i decided to buy it. i was kind of afraid that because of the parental advisory, every song would just be a blast of badmouthing, but it's not. the stuff here is harder than Vol. 1. my favorite songs are ""rock star"" and ""songs from an american movie pt. 2"". I liked the beginnning to ""All F***ed Up"", but they cliche the curse too much. Overall, it's a great album. If you don't have Vol 1, get it too. You'll enjoy both of them."
2,"Worse than Volume 1, by a long shot.","What little ""Volume 1"" had to offer, ""Volume 2"" has even less.There is not one single memorable tune. It's all Everclear-sounding songs, but nothing that jumps out and says, ""Hey, listen to me again!""Competently done, well played, well produced...but utterly inconsequential. ""Rock Star"" even sounds like an Everclear cover band song, like somebody was trying to imitate Alexakis and company.This was WAY boring, I thought."
5,A Surprise Treat,"I hadn't heard of Orange Laughter or its' author Leone Ross prior to reading this novel. But I promise you that after reading this delightful novel you will never forget the book nor its' author. Orange laughter totally surprised me, by the depth to which it was written and the way it navigated from the rural South during the turbulent Civil Rights movement to the present conditions of life under the tunnels of New York. It also managed to provide total insight into the mind of a mentally disturbed individual and how easy it is to go from above average intelligence to insanity. Orange Laughter is brillantly written in a style like none other. A totally enjoyable read."
5,Hand Pruner,"If you want the best, buy these. Outstanding product with superb performance and a great track record. I couldn't be more satisfied with both price and Felco's F-2."
5,Like It!,"Cuts fish gills and fins without a problem! Prunes very well, too, of course. I oil it after each use and cleaning. Comes with a small tool that needs to be kept separately. I'm afraid to lose it."
3,too big for average hands,ordered this as recommended by our vineyard owner. Worked well but too big for average hand. Returned without any problems.
4,excellent tool,"I have only used these for 2 weeks, but so far I'm very pleased. They have a good grip, and are great for pruning my roses, plants of all kinds, and have maintained their sharpness.Marge"
5,Prune like a champ!,Great pruners! Good feel and always a smooth cut. I have used many others but the felcos have always been my favorite.
5,The Pruner that I'll Hand Down to one of the Children,"I've used a pruner for years (and actually it's done other work such as cutting baling twine)and until our nursery man showed me his Felco, I couldn't part with the first one. Now I'm looking for plants that need a ""little tweaking"". What a joy to use! With replaceable parts, this pruner with the bright red handles lives up to the Swiss reputation for a quality product. You definitely get what you pay for with this indispensable tool."
1,I have never seem a Felco F-2 like this one !!!!!,"My wife Bette has 78 roses in her garden which is in the front yard, back yard and on both sides of our home.For many years she had a Felco F-2 which she loved but somehow she lost it (she thinks by putting it with cuttings and put them in the trash) which sounds like something I would do.We went on-line and ordered an F-2 which we recieved and have been trying to work it but it sticks. I have sprayed it with oil several times and it is good for a day of two and then it sticks again.One of the blades has a ridge which is about 1/8"" wide and 1/8"" thick. I don't remember that on the older one (which she loved) having that.Very disappointed and as you know ""If momma aint happy, aint nobody happy.""What is the next step?Howard HochmanP.S. I have an F-3 and am very happy with it."
2,Disappointing,"Given the high reputation of these pruners (and the great reviews they got on Amazon) I decided to invest in them. But as much as I wanted to like them, after six months of use I have to admit I'm disappointed. The blade has already dulled and shows signs of rust, and the pruners now often stick (i.e., do not snap back open after a cut and need to be nudged open). I have oiled them regularly and sharpened as well. It's possible I'm missing something on the maintenance front. But after only six months one would expect a quality product to work well even with less-than-perfect maintenance, no? In short, in my experience these have been no better, and actually a bit worse, than the ""regular"" pruners you can buy for 1/3 the price."
5,These work great,These work great. They are the best i don't think I will ever buy another brand of sheers. They are just perfect
2,Overpriced. Look further.,"Clearly of quality construction, but far too expensive given options that are available. Mine were stolen from my garage, and I replaced them with a two-piece combo purchased at Costco for $19.00. They come with a life-time replacement guarantee. The $19 item cuts just as well as the Felco and is equally comfortable to hold and use."
3,falco cutter,"I was searching for the ""best"" pair of cutters after years of one piece of junk after another. Although this is big step up over others, when will somone make a really solid pair of cutters that will last a lifetime? They cut well, fit is adequate, the clasp lock is as cheesy as other lesser brands. I suspect this pair will last a season or two more only than some other brands I have owned then it too will need to be replaced. ""They just don't make them like they used too"" unfortunately."
5,Perfect tool,"Exceptional tool, easy, comfortable grip. I have used many other brands and this one is at the top my list."
5,Great product!!!,Was given one of these as a gift about 15 years ago and still have it! I decided to buy one for my wife so that I could keep mine handy! Great!
5,Great pruner,My husband asked for a new pruner for Father's Day. I had heard and read about the Felco Pruner and ordered it. It is phenomenal and makes the job of dead heading and trimming so easy.
5,You Get What You Pay For,"Swiss Made - Buy it, you will not be disappointed. Be sure to keep the sap cleaned off the blades as it will cause some sticking over time. These pruners are always on my belt when I am in the garden."
5,Felco F-2 Hand Pruner,"I bought the Felco F-2 hand pruner recently because I wanted a new pair after using my others for over 35 years. The old ones are still usable and better than most other new ones you would buy that are not Felco. Felco are by far the very best hand pruners you can buy. They are expensive but worth every penny. Once you use these high quality pruners you will throw your others away, if you have any. In the long run they are the best buy because with very little or no care they will last indefinitely. I used to grow roses and bought my original Felso hand pruners because they were recommended by the rose growers I dealt with--and they really gave me good advice. These hand pruners are in a class by themselves."
1,Poor quality control,"Although these pruners cost over twice as much as I had paid for pruners in the past, I bought them on Amazon, based on the feedback, thinking I had made a long-term investment. Instead, they have been a royal pain to use. The pruner sticks, meaning that I have to use both hands to make them open. In addition, the safety catch sticks and is hard to use. I've almost cut myself several times as a result.I've used oil, silicone, WD-40 to no avail. I keep thinking something so well rated will improve but that has not occurred. They certainly were a bad choice for me."
4,Bought mine used...,"saved a ton of money. Sure, you can tell they are used, but they came with the original packaging and the tool itself has little wear and tear. Worth it, for me."
5,"In the leaf pile for a year, still fine!","I lost my Felcos last year (I've had them for maybe 5 years). Found them this year when cleaning out the last of the leaf mulch pile. They were still in their leather sheath, which was wet. The Felcos still worked fine! A bit of lube and I unscrewed everything. There was some corrosion on the aluminum and steel that mostly came off with steel wool. The blade had the most corrosion, but was still serviceable. There was only a hint of rust on the spring. Even the leather sheath is still serviceable, after drying out and much Lexol. You can tell the Felcos are not brand new, but that bit of corrosion is a badge of honor!These are my favorite pruners - they hold an edge well, are easy to sharpen, they fit my hand better than anything else, and are easy to hang onto when working. I have another major brand pruner (less expensive) that I use too, but Felcos are more rugged and versatile and definitely worth the price."
1,Not a Felco pruner!,"This is listed as a felco pruner, so I ordered one, however, the pruner I got is NOT Felco. They sent me a pruner made by Zenport Industries in Taiwan. What a ripoff. Please be careful, this is a knockoff of the Felco brand."
5,Best Pruners!,"These are worth the investment, best pruners around, very sharp, clean and easy cuts. Tried and true. I am an avid gardener and these go with me everywhere. If you are looking for your first pruner this is it and go with an F-2 for shrubs, roses."
3,Quality product but overrated,"I expected much more with all the positive reviews. Certainly a quality made product but for the money I should have zero complaints after using for one month. It sticks worse than my prior 2 pairs of ""cheap"" Fiskars which last about 2 years before blades dull. I'd prefer to spend less and replace every couple years than have a product I have to baby, oil after every use, and replace parts. Not as impressed as I was hoping to be."
5,AT LAST,This compilation is amazimg. I was looking for it for years.A friend of mine had it on vinyl since 1983 and I had heard itbut could not find it. If you are into blues GRAB IT as soon asyou can.Angelos Karagiannis
3,Not as described,"Received this figaro chain quickly but it wasn't as described in sellers listing. Stated it had a lobster clasp, which was important to me. Came with a spring clasp. Passed over several other less expensive chains for that reason. Although the chain is nice; it's a dissapointment to me."
1,This was horrible,"This movie was horrible. I would give it zero stars, the only reason I would even give it one is because the very gorgeous Brad Pitt is in it. This movie has charecters are so unbelievable. I could not stand Julia Robert's charecter, she was evil and selfish throughout the entire film. In fact this movie was so terrible that I almost could not sit through it. Do not waste your money in buying or renting this film. Save your money and see it on TV."
1,Toilet - The Movie,"I recently tried to watch this movie by just looking at the case of the movie and thinking that this would be a very romantic movie starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt but i could not watch the whole movie, i had to stop it because of too many toilet related scenes. Because of these scenes it made me think that this movie should not have named The Mexican, it should have named ""Toilet"" or ""Ugly Toilet"" or ""Toilet Exchangers"". There was not a single character in this movie whom the director did not show us going to the toilet. One character comes out of the toilet and the other goes in and this carries on making the viewer think that they do not have any thing else to do. This was an ugliest and worst movie i have seen in my life time. This was an ugly movie by ugly Americans named ""The Mexican"". I think Mexicans should have sued the director. By looking at the above comments, would any body think that i would recommend this movie. Nada"
3,WOW! is this mediocre.,You would think with all that talent on the screen...you wouldn't mind it steal 2 hours out of your life.But I did. And I will never get them back. Nope never.
1,"I Can't Believe Julia Roberts Starred in ""The Mexican.""","As a Julia Roberts' fan, I was very disappointed in this movie. In fact, I fell asleep during it. I've seen Julia in much, much better movies, including ""Mystic Pizza,"" ""Steel Magnolias,"" and ""Pretty Woman."" All of which I own on DVD. Too bad she had to add this one to her resume. I can't believe I bought this DVD! What a waste of money!"
1,Waste of time,"The plot of this movie was really quite stupid and confusing. Brad Pitt, who I think is a very talented actor, was really wasted in this role. And I have never understood the hype about Julia Roberts. She is an extremely mediocre actress, and rather average looking to boot. In this movie, she is exceptionally mediocre. We turned it off about two thirds through--why waste anymore of valuable time."
3,WEIRD ROMANTIC COMEDY... DIDN'T BUY THE ROMANCE THOUGH,"I gave ""The Mexican"" a three star rating because of the amount of star power that was put into this movie. Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini give incredible performances, but the movie falls short somehow. I do admit that I laughed more than a few times, but the romance between Julia and Brad seemed fake. It didn't have enough chemistry to hold its own. The DVD is PACKED with deleted scenes that do add a certain something to the plot. Definitely and strictly a rental. Not worth owning, but worth watching just once."
3,Modern screwball comedy,"I was surprised to like this as much as I did, not a stupendous, mind-blowing film or outrageously hilarious, but quirky. I love the way the Brad Pitt character subtley evolved into the ""smart"" guy as the movie progressed without losing his bumbling charm. I liked the way all the characters kept coming back together and a little bit more of the connection was being revealed. It was well put together in an old-fashioned, screwball comedy kind of way--a clever little bit of entertainment. I could see Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn doing a variation on this. The cinematographic touch of recreating an old hand-cranked camera for the telling of the legend was nice. And I'm an absolute sucker for the Ennio Morricone rip-off soundtrack. I've seen so many absolute dog movies lately . . .I really don't see what so many of the reviewers were complaining about."
3,Hey! THAT was pretty good!,"I bought this DVD for a single scene I had seen once. The scene was worth purchasing the DVD, or so I thought. Wrong! Much of the movie was worth the price of the DVD. Actually, I more than got my money's worth. The acting is great, the plot is a great tease, and it never stops moving. I would have given it 4 stars, but the language was unnecessarily much thicker than I cared for. But all in all, a VERY solid movie."
1,25 Word Or Less Review,So tedious and uninspired I was comparatively enraptured by the Entertainment Weekly I read while this thing plodded on in the background.
4,"Good, Convuluted Story","I liked it. Lot's of people didn't, but for a Brad Pitt movie with my least favorite actress Julia Roberts, I found it highly entertaining. Some violence, some edge of the seat moments and some dark humor. Quite a tale."
5,One of the best movies ive seen,"The Mexican staring two world wide known actors Julia Roberts and oh so hot Brad Pitt, is a great movie! its halarious, yet a romance movie of how Jerry (brad pitt) has to do one last job , but meanwhile Sam (julia), thinks that his last job is the last straw! Its a thrilling movie that makes your wonder whos on whos side!It takes you on two trips. The movie starts with Brad and julia together and ends with them together but in between its a whole different story.I wont give off anymore, so i don't spoil the fun of the people who haven't seen it!Its a great movie though! thats why i bought it! ive watched it 20 times on satellite and now i have the movie and will watch it even more! heehee! i love it! Brad pitts hot!Buy the movie everyone!!!!"
2,Mexican pistol.,"Two hours of not-so-funny comedy/thriller all concerning a Mexican pistol that none of the audience gives a s... about. (Bad McGuffin). Pitt and Roberts are both very cute, but Gandolfini steals the show. A few amusing moments, but mostly boring."
2,NOT FUNNY OR EVEN ROMANTIC,"This is not romantic, funny or enterteining.It's something boring and stupid.Julia Roberts always looks radiant.And Brad Pitt can't do much here.The should try to do something else together, but thet aren't a nice couple."
1,Not much ....,"Unless you really do not have any thing else to watch at night, then have a go... but you can certainly speed-forward the video for some part. The scenario was basically made around a couple of famous actor, but the story is really nothing to be doing kart-wheels about! I do not recommend this movie even though the main actors are nice to watch. Julia Roberts always has a great laugh and smile...."
2,Actually Pretty Boring,"The interesting part of this movie is the story behind ""The Mexican"" which is a one of a kind gun that Brad Pitt is sent to get for the mob. They do little vignettes whenever Brad Pitt finds out more history about the gun, which is the only entertaining part of the movie. Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts hardly spend any time together in the movie, maybe because they both suck as actors and the supposed chemistry between them was laughable? So only rent this if you think Pitt or Roberts is a ""hottie"", since the acting throughout the movie is lame. Any attempts at humour fail, as does much of the movie. It was so boring that I kept getting distracted and focusing on more interesting things, like the tread of my shoe and my split ends."
2,surprisingly disappointing,"I thought that a film with Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt would have to be a good one. This isn't the case. The story hardly holds together and rambles. Even Roberts and Pitt lose some of their appeal as the protagonists they play are non sympathetic characters who, in the end, I didn't care about at all. The only character to elicit my sympathy was the hired killer who at least is changed by his experiences in the movie. The others remained unaffected, as I was."
1,After 15 Minutes,this film goes down hill. You keep expecting it to pick up but the story let's the actor's down. I watch this because of the star's past reputation. They have both made some good movie's. But in this film you need more than just star chasima to carrey a film. Pitt seems to have fun with the role and his take on it is fun but Robert's is relying to much on her smile. If she ever loses her teeth she is in trouble. There are few suprises and you come away disapointed. This movie you forget as soon as you get out of the theater. That's why the review. I would like to see better movie's. Movie's with some comic insperation. When we give film's like this a good review we get what we deserve. These actor's and especially writer's can do better.
1,the mexican,"i ordered this movie oct. 14, 2001 and never received it-buyers beware-there is a crook on this line"
2,A disappointment........,"Ever since I viewed this movie, I've been trying to figure out how they ever got two big stars like Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt to appear in it. The loosely-woven plot centers around a beautiful pistol, inlaid with silver, which seems to be valuable to a lot of people. Brad Pitt had the temerity to run into a big-time crook with his car and ever since then has worked off his debt by doing the bad guy's dirty deeds. (How unlikely is that?) His last assignment is to recover the gun and bring it back to his boss. Julia Roberts is kidnapped by another bad guy with a heart of gold and they form a real bond as the movie progresses. It's hard to tell who's a bad guy and who's a good guy and frankly, by the end of the movie, I didn't care!"
4,Very funny,I have heard a lot of people complain that there is no interaction between Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt but if you over look that it is still a very good film. The interaction between Roberts and James Gandolfini is really what makes the film interesting. Pitt is also very good even though he is rarely in a scene with Roberts. A very funny film and if you like either of these actors their performances are excellent. Do not over look this film because it did not live up to some peoples unfounded expectations.
4,What's not to like?,"I cannot even begin to understand what people do not like about this film. Is it an epic? nah. It is funny? you bet it's funny. Maybe that's why so many people here have panned it. A lack of a sense of humor in the subtleties of humor. There is a lot of wry wit in this, with some fun characters, parodies of life, personal development stories, etc etc. In all, a broad stroke of paint on the canvas of life's problems and challenges. This will not go down as one of the most memorable of roles for either Brad Pitt of Julia Roberts, but must EVERY movie be judged by a performers' prior best works? Can't we just sit back and enjoy something for the fun of it? Too many of the reviews here seem tooooo overburdened by what the reviwer almost wishes what this movie could have been, instead of what it is -- a wry, subtle, humourous road/love epic. And enjoyable at that!"
3,"Quirky, romantic comedy","People going in expecting your typical Julia Roberts romantic comedy will be disappointed-- it is a romantic movie, but with an edge, a body count, some language, and the two stars separated together. When they are together they work well, but Roberts works best with James Gandolfini. There scenes together are funny and touching-- while Pitt displays some fine physical comedy... it does get a little long, but it is enjoyable. I love the DVD... if you liked ""Nurse Betty""... or quirky, independent romantic comedies then give it a try. This was a small budget film that did well thanks to two big stars."
3,Mixed feelings,"I enjoyed the majority of this movie, but there were some big holes in this movie. There is no doubt that James Gandolfini steals this movie as the homosexual hitman. This is a great character. The script is very well written, but it reaches a point where it stretches a bit long. You start to say, ""Ok that's enough, how much more do you have to put these people through?"" Julia Roberts was a sweetheart, like always, but Brad Pitt was a little to stupid for my liking. I really don't think a crime boss would but this guy in charge of something this important. My favorie scene is Nayman's huge speech explaining what Jerry has to do. This is a great, great speech; worthy of a college student to do it for an Acting 1 monologue."
2,Like a good pudding but then there is a fly...,"The music is terrific. The atmosphere of Mexico is terrific. Brad Pitt is good. I can't stand Roberts. What is she doing, going for the Barbara Streisand acting award? Talk about annoying. I mean really annoying... The movie is on the one hand fun as long as she is not on the screen. But then she is back on the screen..."
1,Just a terrible movie!!!,"The only thing to say about The Mexican is that it is a monumental disaster! It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and joins the ranks of other movie stinkers such as Batman and Robin and The Quest for Camelot. I suppose the director thought that by getting big names to be in his movie (Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts) that he could make this movie flop, a hit. This is not the case at all. He was horribly mistaken. The story goes absolutely nowhere and from the very first scene, there begins a steep downward spiral. So if you enjoy watching movies with no plot and horrible a script, by all means, view this movie. But if you like movies with plots and a somewhat presentable script, avoid The Mexican at all cost. This movie is not worth the time or the paper the script was printed on."
1,"OK Idea, Poorly Executed","Julia was good. Brad was his usual wooden, only appeals to adolescent females, boyish, hopeless self. Together they might as well have been in different movies. NO CONNECTION! James Gandolfini stole the entire movie. He was awesome, and he and Roberts did manage to generate some believable interaction. Not enough to save the movie. Hackneyed imagery, blown opportunities. An over the top boring bad guy. Save your money and the precious time you might spend. They are both wasted on this turkey."
2,Nice packaging,"Yeah, nice packaging. But content... something is lacking and I'm not sure what it is. I didn't get bored watching this film, but I didn't get very excited either. I think I chuckled twice, both times at Pitt's character. This film just seemed like vanilla... nothing particlularly bad about it, but nothing particularly good about it either. Bland..."
2,can't just make it happen ....,"Its obvious the filmakers bet on chemistry between Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and a clever screenplay to carry this movie - unfortunately the chemistry just isnt there between these two and the screenplay, well it isnt very clever or smart. So what you have is a very forgettable road movie."
2,"I'm surprised it was dull, boring and bad...","I was surprised that Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt choose this movie to play. It wasn't Roberts-isk. Nor do I think it was Pitt-isk. Funny in few parts but overall the movie is dull and boring.About a Mexican gun with a ""story"" behind it. Jerry (Pitt) is set out to hunt the gun down and bring it back to his ""boss"". In the meantime, someone 'kidnaps' Sam (Julia Roberts), who is Jerry's than girlfriend, to tell him where the gun is and where Jerry is. Sam knows nothing, of course, because they broke up because Jerry keeps being Jerry (aka selfish, not ready to settle down).In the long run, someone gets killed, all others are threatened by someone else. And in the end it's a happy ever after story, as well all know that's how stories usually end up.Again funny few parts but I suggest one to pass on the movie. It's not Roberts or Pitt's best!!"
3,The Mexican,"Brad Pitt is a bungling thug, Julia Roberts is his shrill and ditzy girlfriend, and James Gandolfini is a hit man with a penchant for talking about feelings.Fans of Pitt and/or Roberts should get a kick out of THE MEXICAN, but I thought it was too long, too loud, and the two stars' scenes together more grating than amusing. Gandolfini plays a mob thug who discusses emotions with Roberts after kidnapping her. If that sounds a lot like an episode of The Sopranos, you're right. If this had just been a Gandolfini/Roberts film I suspect I would have enjoyed it quite a bit more than I did."
1,Tragic Comedy???,"One of the worst movies ever made. Mades for long for an Istar re-release. Not one worthwhile character in the whole mix. Are we truly supposed to feel sorrow for the gay contract killer and share his loss. Regardless of how well you develope the chacters, if every one in the movie is a killer and a loser how do you feel for any of them??? Mindless dribble posing as art."
1,Utterly awful! America spent 60+ mill on watching this! Ugh!,"Pitt has proven time & time again that he is a rare breed! Hollywood's pretty boy WITH talent (Meet Joe Black, Kalifornia, Fight Club). Roberts makes ""girlie"" flicks and, in my opinion, ranks up there with G.Close in good looks! Uh-huh! Pitt & Roberts are the unlikely couple that go seperate ways after she finds out he has to do a ""job"" in Mexico. From here it goes downhill! There's even characters that have NO point being in this flick! Sappy, Hollywood ending..."
3,Put the deleted scenes back in and I'd buy it,"I liked this movie but it could have been so much more if the deleted scenes had been left in. The acting was great, I mean You've gotta love a movie where the hero keeps dropping his gun. The story was compelling and the legend of the pistola (done wonderfully to mimic the era of silent films) really make this one special. Too bad they didn't put the same running edit feature as they had on Me Myself and Irene where you could watch the movie with the deleted scenes inserted if you chose to do so."
2,I am glad that I didn't see this is the movive theater,"....this is movie is okay to rent....it did have some cute, funny momments....Brad Pitt did a pretty good as the doofus, ganster (or whatever you want to call him).......but I think that Julia Roberts is soooooooooooo over-rated, there I said it. I know she is America's Sweetheart Super Movie Star.....but, she always seems to be playing herself. This movie became drawn out.....get to the point.....I guess the point is that it is another ""Julia Roberts perfect tooth smile movie."""
4,whats all the flack?,"i heard this movie was a dud. boy did i hear wrong. it was funny plain old fashioned funny.as my husband said, it's one of those rode map movies. you need one to keep track. i like a movie that makes me feel something. it doesn't matter what it makes me feel. happy, sad, reflective. just so i don't get get to the end and feel disapointed. the mexican started out making you think. you had to watch it to be entertained. i like that. i shows that the people who made it trusts us to really watch it. they don't wrap it up and hand it to you all nice and tidy. the cast is so wonderful. you know they had to like what they were doing. the comady was fun the drama was dramatic and the storyline was very unique. i recomend this movie to anyone who likes comady, pitt, roberts and gandolphino. it's a hoot. well worth the time and the money."
3,The long movie,The movie gets long. It very funny but the only reason to see it would be for its great cast. THe key word is video!
4,This is one cool movie.,"In the grand scheme of things, this isn't the greatest movie ever made. But we don't always go to the theatre for art do we? No we go to have a good time, and that is exactly what this movie is, a good time. The plot takes a few twists and turns, and some of the shots are rather beautiful, but what really makes this movie fun is the characters. You grow to like them as the grow through the movie and wince when the make mistakes. The humor in the movie plays well against the action and romance. This is the first action/romance that I've ever seen work. I highly recommend this movie."
2,A Lousy film,"It stinks. Brad Pit doesn't work as a bad guy. Julia doesn't look good in this movie either. James Gandolfini plays a character like Tony Soprano - a professional bad guy mixed with some genuine, down-to-earth, human characteristics. Most of the scenes in Mexico are done as humorous stereotypes. The plot is junk."
2,Amateur hour,"This movie is a mess. The convoluted plot could probably work in good hands, but the direction is completely lacking in focus, and the editing is atrocious. Pitt and Gandolfini turn in good performances -- the only redeeming qualities to be found here. There are too many plot points that don't make any sense at all. One fairly prominent character disappears without a trace about halfway through the movie, and there is no explanation as to what happened to him -- or how a particular plot thread was resolved. You do figure that out after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD -- but why were these two or three key scenes deleted? This movie was made by a bunch of no-talent amateurs who got in way over their heads."
1,Almost Criminal,"The title of this review refers to the waste of Julia's and Jimmy Gs talents. If I'd known in advance of buying this turkey that the director was also responsible for ""Mouse Hunt"" of a few years ago, I'd not bought it, even though I'm fond of Julia and Jimmy. Mr. Pitt isn't very convincing either. Specifically, this film is a dog because: Incredible poor editing. You have to see the outakes to get a glimmer of what this film is about and then it's so what. Julia and Jimmy struggled valiantly to save this mess, but their efforts were wasted on such a thin story line."
3,Did anyone one else notice,"the fun quirky stuff in this movie? The lamppost, the dog, the continual theme of peeing? Wierd, funny, quirky.That is all there is in this movie that is worth enjoying. The rest of it is garbage. Sorry to Brad and Julia, not to mention James, but did you guys actually READ this script first?"
3,"Quirky, amusing, and a little long.","Brad Pitt is great at those little comedic gestures of frustration; there are funny moments throughout, although you may feel that this movie is overlong. There's the token gay couple (one tough and violent, both likeable, but you knew that), many variants of the history of an old gun everyone's after, traffic lights in the middle of nowhere, endearing characters, some memorable scenes. Worth at least one watch."
3,Mexican Standstill,"A movie that, considering it's ample star power, should've been so much better. Brad Pitt is charming enough, but Julia Roberts is at her most annoyingly strident. Only James Gandolfini makes the movie shine as the complex, deep-thinking hitman. When he wasn't on-screen, I found myself checking my watch."
2,Probably Not Worth Your Money,"This movie is quite confusing, actually.. I left the theatre bewildered. The only reason I gave it two stars is for Brad, Julia and the hilarious Leroy. I have to say, some parts that were trying to be funny were actually quite morbid- such as when Brad shoots the man in his foot, unmercifially- I found myself wincing for him. I'd have to see this movie again to understand at least some of it, but for now- no thanks, I'll pass."
5,An Actual Review,"The title of the book says a lot about it (unsurprisingly). If you are not interested in system cybernetics, such as the first 2 reviewers, you should not (obviously) pick up the book and attempt to read it. To say ""I don't understand it so its bad"" or ""there's too many big words"" is really infantile. This book is aimed at the intellectual. His other books, such as Radiant Mind are entirely experiential therapeutic meditation handbooks that anyone can understand! Read those instead, if you don't have a philosophy degree."
1,How not to understand Madhymika,"This book attributes inconsistent premisses to Madhaymika, and then, wonder of wonder, finds that contradictions can be deduced. Dumb beyond words. Don't waste your money."
1,Terrible book,"This is a terrible book. It is all just a bunch of mumbo jumbo gobbledy gook. It says nothing. The author is just trying to see how many big words he can put in a book, all saying nothing. Don't waste your money, this is not even a joke of a book it is so bad."
4,mystery of history,Great for multiple grades. Hands on activity for each week. Makes learning fun and adaptable for all ages.
3,Not for us,"I bought this curriculum because it was recommended by some friends but it did not work for us. We found it to be a bit boring. My fifth grader already knew a lot of the information and it was even a bit repetitious for my 2nd grader. We had always done our own unit studies before and we missed the indepth study of a subject that we loved. It was easy to use, but it definately took the joy out of learning for us. I did like the way she incorporates Christ into all of the lessons, but this is something I already do with my children. My guess is that most people would probably like the way this is set up, it just didn't work for us."
3,Didn't Work for Us...,"I bought the book to use with my 2nd-grader and 8th-grader together. This was a mistake, as the book presented very little information that my 8th-grader didn't already know, and too many unimportant tidbits that were confusing to my 2nd-grader. This is neither a big-picture introduction to World History, nor an in-depth secondary-level study. The book is well-suited for a first history text for 3rd-5th graders, I think. MOH is a good choice for a student who loves variety, as lessons jump in chronological order from one location and culture to another from day to day. This jumping around is a difficult format for a child who needs repetition. I ended up switching curricula in the middle of the year."
5,Mystery of History is awesome!,This is an awesome resource for homeschooling. My boys finished (and LOVED) Story of the World. We have been searching for a new curriculum... and finally found it. They LOVE this!!My boys are in 6th grade. It has options for kids of all ages and abilities. It is wonderful.
2,Sorry to be a spoil sport.,"I was very disappointed in this text.I like that bible history is included in the chronology. However, I wanted more world history...too much of this text is bible history. We have had to delve into Mesopotamia, Egypt and China and Greece from other sources and therefor are quite ""behind"" for the year. And we haven't gotten to Rome yet.That being said, I did feel comfortable dropping our bible curriculum and just using MOH for that, although I do disagree with the author on some of the implications of the bible characters. (especially Gideon)I think this is more of a biblical history, with some stuff that was going on at the same time in the rest of the world...as opposed to a comprehensive world history text that includes bible history.My son does not care for history, and this text did not change his mind.I adore history, but find this text difficult to relate to and not detailed about the most interesting bits."
4,Mystery of History + Story of the World works for us.,"I appreciate Linda's biblical foundations and biblical framework for teaching history. I have implemented her timeline activity for my first grader and we both enjoy it. Having said that, I will say that I much prefer reading the historical narratives, legends, and stories from ""The Story of the World."" When I read to my first grader from Mystery of History, it goes over her head. I would not enjoy using Mystery of History on its own. I recommend this book and when we start the next section of history next year, we will be ordering her Volume 2 and the Story of the World, Volume 2 as well."
5,Love it.,"Card Player Magazine, this one (Casino Player), and Poker Pro are my favs.Nolan Dalla, J. Phillip Vogel, and Rob Wiser are great writers and have add to the entertainment and knowledge of poker and the casinos live and online."
4,dvd,"Fun Dvd, grand kids liked it. Would reccomend to others. It was something different than we had watched before, good for kids."
2,A disapointment,The story line is weak the acting even from cartoons is terrible. The one about snow white is the worst. We only made it through about 20 minutes. Not worth time or money
4,Different...,"If you were to take all Garth Brooks' CDs and pick out the one that is the most unlike the others, this would have to be it. Out of all the Garth CDs, I think this one is my least favorite. Not because it's bad and not because it's not 'country' enough, just because I don't like it as must as the others.But, it's worth buying just to have some of the songs on it. *Face to face* is an amazing song that a lot of people can really relate to. *Every now and then* is a great piece, and *Somewhere other than the night* is my personal favorite on the disc.For the true Garth Brooks fan, you will want this CD no matter what. As it is written on the case ""Every artist seems to have an album that reflects 'the person' rather than 'the artist.' The Chase is that album for Garth Brooks."""
1,Be afraid,"Be afraid - be very afraid. Because of his popularity, it may encourage other no-talent musicians to keep recording. Why not? Look what Garth has done with very damn little talent. This cd is solid proof."
5,A Family Tradition,"My father introduced me and my brother to this wonderful album after adopting a beagle for us and naming her ""Arrow"". He wanted us to have it while he was away at sea (Vietnam). The comfort of our little ""Arrow"" and what we believed to be ""her album"" made the separation from our father easier and our dog would go crazy, when hearing ""Me and My Arrow"". We listened over and over and over again. The songs and narration are outstanding and hearing them again as an adult is a whole new experience. I think this should be a family tradition, passed down to generations and I have already started the trend with my family."
5,A review from Colorado,"In the late 1970's I lent my copy of ""The Point"" to a co-worker and I never saw the album again. After seeing ""You've Got Mail"" and hearing Harry Nilsson's voice again, I knew I had to find this story again. It is wonderful to have amazon.com and the efficiency with which they operate. Thank you so much....."
4,5 Stars for the Story. 3 for the Music.,"This CD is really REALLY hard to find anywhere but online. The story is so good! I love Harry's voice as the narrator; it has a soothing yet captivating tone that is ideal for storytelling. The music is only pretty good. A few of the songs are excellent, but the rest are just OK. Adults listening to The Point! will think about what really is ""pointless"" and what is not; and about how as the man in the Pointless Forest says, ""a point in every direction is the same as having no point at all."" Kids will hear a heartwarming story about a boy who doesn't fit in (and his lovable dog!) who is able to show everyone that it's okay (and in fact sometimes good) to be different."
3,"Beautiful album art, perplexing content...","Another obscure offering from Mayo Thompson and friends. The album doesn't list musician credits, but from the sound of it he's back with members of Tortoise and Gastr Del Sol (particulaly, David Grubbs.) Much like those bands and the recent RK albums, this is an exercise in abstract beauty and minimalism, which translates into wonder and frustration for the listener. The first song sounds alot like Tortoise with Mayo singing a typically atonal, meandering melody on top. After a few minutes a roller-rink sounding keyboard chimes in with a repetitive riff that seems to go on forever. If you can get past that, you'll find a few pleasantly breezy, experimental ""ballads."" It often takes a awhile for new RK to sink in, but I'd say for the casual listener there's nothing here to impress you. But a Krayola fanatic will assuredly lap it up, much as I did."
5,Fosse's Funny Faustian Fantasy,"Pardon the expression, but Damn Yankees is funny as hell, filled with devilish humor and great music! I think I like it better even than Cabaret and Chicago, two other great Fosse musicals. Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon sizzle as the horned one and his temptress. They could have done better than Tab Hunter as Joe, but he does a fine job. The movie was made in 1958 but it doesn't seem dated because it's dealing with universal themes. Watch it and laugh and sing!"
5,GREAT!,"They don't make em like this anymore...great choreography, terrific Gwen, a wonderful musical! See it!"
4,God Bless Those Damn Yankees,"If you have any love for GOOD Broadway theatre, you will love this movie. It not only contains quite a few of the original Broadway stars (Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon just to name two) but quite a number of the supporting cast as well. In other words, this casting is a dream. And to be honest with you, Tab Hunter, in one of is earlier works hard at playing Joe Hardy and quite nearly pulls it off.The singing and the wonderfull dancing really pull this show upwards. Especially when you can see Gwen Verdon dancing with her real life husband, choreographer Bob Fosse in the ""Who's Got the Pain?"" number. A real show stopper.This in one DVD you will play, again and again every time you want to remember what the Golden Age of Broadway was like, or just want to get a great taste of good theatre transfered to the screen. Get it and enjoy it!"
2,Sound off ???,I waited to long to view the tape and found the sound and picture don't match. Did not return because of the time but am very disapointed in the quality as the music is one of the best parts of the video and it is now uncomfortable to watch (Kinda like a dubbed Japanese movie)
4,Don't judge this movie by it's cover!,"Fun, Sexy, Cute! What you'd want in a musical. Except for the sexy part. Too much sugestive dialogue and lyrics. Other than that, great. But why the heck did they put Lola in her slinky outfit on the cover?"
1,Fantastic Material But Be Warned,"The film of Damn Yankees is a wonderful and a faithful recreation of the stage musical, but be warned: the current DVD release is a butchered mess. There are only 4 songs left in the film, entire scenes and plot points have been edited out, it runs a little over 90 minutes and is a total mess. I have seen the film before and know what it is like, and the DVD release, or at least the copy I had, was an abomination. Had posted a review once before but removed it after another poster vehemently argued and insisted I was wrong (in not so nice terms). I even went and ran the DVD to make sure I was not nuts, and I am absolutely, 100% accurate in my assessment. It is a mess!"
4,Period piece but camp fun!,This is very much a period piece but take it for what it is and it's good fun. Great performances by Tab Hunter and Gwen Verdon; fantastic performance by Ray Walston listed film from a 3 star to 4 star film. May Lola carry on getting what Lola wants. Great fun.
2,"If you like the stage production, you will be disappointed!","I was very disappointed. The acting by the principles was fine, but I think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by Bob Fosse. I think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs. The following tunes from the original show were left out - Near To You, We've Got To Think About the Game, A Man Doesn't Know. And Applegate's tune, The Good Old Days, was abridged. A new tune, There's Something About an Empty Chair, was added to replace Near To You, but it was very weak. I wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they've done recently with Music Man and Bye Bye Birdie."
2,The book was better.,"I read the book ""The year the Yankees lost the Pennant"" years ago but had never seen the play. I bought the movie and was disappointed that several critical scenes from the book had been changed in the play/movie. They left out the finale where Joe Hardy is changed back to the salesman as he rounds the bases. The Devil, a Yankee fan, wants him out. He is out but the ump calls him safe so the Senators win. The story ends with the Devil putting on a Yankee cap and arguing with the umpire- but no one, not even the Devil, can change an umpire's decision!"
3,Damn Yankees,"I have liked the story for many years. The DVD is ""grainy"", being a reproduction of some other media (I'm not sure which - VHS or original film)."
4,damn yankees,i ordered this because our community theatre is going to do this musical and i wanted to see the dance numbers. it was interesting to see fosse dance in his early works.
3,I know there is another version of this play,"i really like the play, thought this was the one i saw in the movies many years ago, but it wasn't, don't remember who was in that movie but this was not it.."
4,An Enriching Study,"I went through this Bible study with a new moms' group. This was my first Bible study in 10 years and I found the format of the study friendly, encouraging and challenging. Barbara Henry asks the difficult questions of women - why are we built the way we are as individuals and as a group - all the while reminding us of our soft place to land in God's love. The study never felt like the word according to Barbara Henry, but rather a study in the true sense of the word. She encourages reading, researching, cross-referencing and discussing the tenets of Titus 2 so that we may encourage each other in discovering God's will for our lives. My recommendation is to use this study as another tool in your shed to sharpen your knowledge of the Bible, to discover God's intentions for your life and to find encouragement in your relationships with women. Ms. Henry's book was very effective in helping me do just that."
2,"""Missed it by THAT much""","This album should have been great. It's a great idea but the execution is lacking. The symphonic arrangements are competent but the sound isn't nearly as impressive as an average Telarc release. The cameo vocal performances by various special guests are reasonably good but generally uninteresting. The surprise highlight is Adrian Baker's vocal labyrinth on ""Warmth of the Sun""."
5,A TIGHT CD,"FIRST OFF I WANNA SAY THAT I AM A BIG DAZ AND JT FAN. I'VE HEARD THERE LAST ALBUM ""LONGBEACH TO FILLMORE"" AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS ALBUM IS WAY BETTER. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I LUV 13 OUT OF THE 16 TRACKS SPECIALLY 1-8. IF U LIKE DAZ,JT,E-40,DRU DOWN,KURUPT,C-BO AND ALL OTHER WESTCOAST RAPPERS, THIS IS A MUST HAVE ALBUM. BUY IT, U WONT REGRET IT"
5,jt and daz dilly come off with some hot ish,This is str8 westcoast at itz best comin off thier not so good release longbeach to fillmoe this is better then lonbeach to fillmoe if you a daz or jt or westcoast cop thiz.
4,Outstanding ! But with a concern.,"With respect to fit, finish, and performance, this AP is an outstanding value at the AMAZON new price. My only caveat is that, if one buys it in""like new"" condition (as I did, at a considerable discount), it would be well to ensure that the piece has been scrupulously maintained. Though there was no visible pitting involved, removal of light rust from the bore and action was necessary. Fortunately, cocking, loading, and accuracy seem not to have been affected."
5,Great trash can,"This trash can is large and easy to use. With the step mechanism, you do not have to touch the can. The lid can also be pushed open to stay open. Best of all, with this design, you do not have to use their specially-designed (and expensive) trash can liners. I use regular 13-gallon trash can liners with no problem."
2,Disappointed,Ours is a little over a year old and the lid is broken. Seems to me the drive gear that opens and shuts the lid is too strong for the hindge. Over time the hindge broke on us. $70 for a one year of use is not worth it for us. I must say I loved it when it worked.
3,What batteries?,This can is great. Until the the battery cover and batteries fall into the trash and you take the bag out to the curb. Then you have a really expensive can with a manual lid.
1,Very Loud,This trash can is attractive but it makes a lot of noise when the foot press is pushed and the lid opens. I returned the item and got a full refund.
5,"So good, you'll forget that it's Christmas music","Firstly, a caveat. I hate Christmas music. I love Christmas, I am a Christian, but I hate Christmas music. I made a promise to myself to never ever purchase a holiday album; I love to sing carols and play them in church, but other than that, the commercial people can keep their schmaltz. However, I know what Phillip Aaberg is capable of, and when I saw this album, I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.I am so glad that I did. He re-interprets the old carols, and writes some wonderful new ones, they are so vibrant and full of life that you will see Christmas in a new light. This album can be played at any time of the year, and I know of no other holiday album that can do that. If you love good music and hate Xmas music, this CD is for you. Trust me."
4,exceptional Piano,"exceptional playing and recording, I had only one Phil Aaberg CD until this order. I really like it."
4,Fun movie!,"This is a fun movie! It's a Saturday Matinee ""popcorn"" type of movie. There's no ""academy award-winning"" performances here, just good fun watching car chases/crashes.Note: Why would anyone think a move made in 1977 would be based upon the video/computer game that's popular now? lol"
4,Great review of a movie not based on a video game...,"This is a great movie with a lot of, yes I said it, car crashes. This movie has the most car crashes in one movie. And it was made waaaay before the games were made. If you want this movie thinking its based on the video game, shop elsewhere. If you want a good car crash movie, check this out."
3,"Grand Theft Auto-Cool Cars,Neat Rolls but shoulda had a Vette!","Ron Howard I have never liked nor Corman but I enjoy the film because of the Rolls Royce and the Neat Cars,Although I thsould have a Vette' in it as the Lead Car Star. And More Vettes,But I digress,I love how the ugly FIAT X1/9 1300(138AS)-The yellow car at the start before they take the Rolls-just comes apart.The Acting and plot I could do without,also the little as usual Ron Howard Style-jabs at Christianity-(this time at the Typical Protestants with a Preacher,but funny I never seen a movie he has made poking Fun at IslamOrthe Jewish Community?-instead you get propaganda based off the davinci book and angelsanddemons)it's the Chase and the cars,I hate the destroyed Rolls perhaps it was This LiberalElitist way of getting back at the So-called Man,regardless of the film makers motive and ugly mug I love Car movies especially of this era."
4,The Destroy a Rolls Royce,"This was the directorial debu for film legend Ron Howard he also stars in it along with borther Clint Howard and Maryion Ross makes an apperance in it(she was Maryion Cunningham on Happy Days)they destroy some of the best cars in the world in this film including a Rolls Royce,Porche and many more but I found staring Ron Howard it had a pit of a chessy feel to it and more of a happy-go-lucky feeling over hard core action but still a real neat film for any car fans"
2,not what i thought,"I thought this movie was going to be like the video game ""Grand Theft Auto"", boy was i wrong. Its not a horrible movie or anything but i was expecting alot of blood and violance and it turned out to be a Ron Howard Movie."
1,Worst shredder to-date,The JS 55 heats up too fast and you have to wait up to 20 minutes (or more?) for it to cool back down. Also shreds too wide and overall is too expensive for the trouble that it is.
1,Poor design leads to poor performance,Poor exit design at the bottom of the shredder leads to frequent jamming. Jams are also very difficult to remove due to the narrow crevice. The noise level is also very loud compared to the relative little power of the device itself. I spend far more time unjamming the machine than I do shredding documents.
1,Don't buy this.,I returned this product because it was not worth keeping...even though it cost me $7 to return it. It jammed up the first time I used it to cut up two sheets of paper. An expensive lesson when you consider it was only a $20 item.
1,dangerous junk! dont buy!,crap! fire hazard!!!dies after every few sheets! don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is the absolute worse shredder you could ever waste your money on!
3,Adequate Product for Low Security Shredding,"This strip shredder is adequate as home shredder meant to discourage the casual information sniffer from stealing your information from your garbage. One problem I have had with it is that it occasionally continues to run, requiring me to switch it into reverse and back to forward to ""finish off"" whatever I am shredding. This seems to mainly happen when shredding a single sheet or small item."
1,It's in the GARBAGE,"I purchased this product as a used, but ""in perfect working ordr. As soon as I used it the first time, I saw that this machine could not shred toilet paper. It jamed with every attempt I tried. It was apparently not in "" WORKING ORDER "". I took this machine out to the garbage within 5 days of frustration."
1,It broke already,This paper shredder is poorly constructed and already broke. Very cheap. Do not buy.
2,This product did not live up to expectations,We thought is would be a bigger version of the shredder.. and it can only be used for a minute at a time
2,Flimsy Device,"Not exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to replace a shredder that had quit working. Yet the basket is still in excellent shape. It would be nice to find a good portable shredder that will fit on a wire basket that was designed to accommodate a shredder. Why discard the basket if the shredder quits working? This Royal model is a rather flimsy device. It doesn't shred credit cards. Then the overview didn't say it would, either. Still, it will only shred a few pages at a time; it's loud, too. It will suffice for now."
1,Regrettable purchase,"From all outer appearances this item looked like it would function well in my office. The day I received it I eagerly placed paper in it only to question if I was using it correctly. I discovered that this item requires an hour or so to warm up before it will shred anything as fed.But here are some suggested ways to work around it: First, you can leave paper in the mouth and it will sit inactively for 40-60 minutes before it arbitrarily shreds. The noise level is comparable to a sink disposal. A second alternative is to feed the paper from bottom up and hit reverse because that is the only working function available from the get-go."
1,Wide stipes,"The paper stripes of 1/4"" are too wide. at times Information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear. IF somebody is really after information he shouldn't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your papers"
1,do not buy,This shredder is ok if you have 3 sheets to shred once a week. You cannot shred sheet repeatedly. It clogs up and is very hard to operate.
2,Royal Paper Shredder,"I was disappointed in this shredder. It jams frequently and overheats much too quickly. It won't last long I'm sure, and I certainly won't replace it with the same product."
1,Piece of Trash,"This shredder stopped feeding the paper 10 minutes after I got it. The manual says to only use for 2 minutes and then let it rest for 4 minutes and then turn the power off, put it in reverse and start over. A long and annoying process! I tried all kinds of things to get it to feed the paper but nothing. Not even worth the 14 dollars it costs!"
1,If I could give a negative number of stars I would,This is a piece of garbage. It jams even if you try to shred only one sheet of paper the size of a CHECK at a time!DO NOT BUY!! you'd just be throwing your money down the tube.It is literally faster to cut up your waste paper with a pair of scissors than to spend time trying to un-jam this piece of garbage.PS I didn't buy this from Amazon. I have never been dissatisfied with anything I have purchased from Amazon.
1,Worked for Less Than One Week!,"This is a complete waste of money. This machine shreds just one piece of paper at a time. It does not shred credit cards. After I had this machine for less than one week, I was using it one morning, one sheet at a time, for about 15 minutes. It died! Totally stopped working.This is a complete DO NOT BUY!I gave it one star because I couldn't figure out how to post my review with no stars."
3,"does the job, a little cheaply made","this thing does what it's intended to do (at standard range). the plastic is pretty cheap and seems fragile. i don't like how the antenna only turns upward in one direction. a lot of usb ports on computers are vertical where this, as you can see by the picture, only allows the antenna to accomodate a horizontal port.i wonder if the antenna even serves a purpose because i can't find this device up to 100 meters like the description claims it can."
1,Terrible!,"This adapter didn't work at all when I got it. So just for the heck of it I took it apart to maybe see what was the problem and the antenna is only there for looks. It isn't even attached. haha dumbest thing i've ever seen. This is why the other person that rated this doesn't get good reception. The only good thing about this transaction was that the company I bought them from credited me without even returning them. Very promptly too.they probably realized they were junk too. haha Surprisingly walmart sells a very nice adapter for $20.00. This is cheaper (after shipping) easier, and doesn't have that useless antenna."
2,British Original SoundTrack - 1 CD version,"I thought I was buying the 2 CD set, so was rather disappointed when I received the one with only 1 CD.The 2 CD set includes the track, Hold That Sucker Down, probably the best track on the set. Without this song to listen to, I find the single CD rather a waste of money."
5,Nobody's Angel,This book is like all of Karen Robards books; EXCELLENT. I love the way Karen Robard writes. She's a terrific story teller.
4,A rare Robards historical romance,"This book has long been one of my favorite historical romances, including all the elements of a great read: intriguing plot, relatable heroine, and a hero that has a lot more to him than meets the eye. I am a big fan of Robard's historical romances - one of my favorite trilogies is her series on the Banning sisters - and I cannot say enough good things about Nobody's Angel.This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a departure in the normal ""stunning"" beauty with a fashionable figure and enviable social life - Sarah is the older sister who fades into the background when in the presence of her beautiful younger sister, yet Sarah ends up catching the eye of the handsome hero, who has a past of his own.Word of warning - this is not a suspenseful thriller like Robards' novels of recent years, just an entertaining historical romance novel that will bring a smile to face when you're in the mood to read a story with no other expectation than a happy ending."
5,"Wonderful romance with a ""plain looking"" girl.",This was a very fast paced book that kept me on edge anticipating turning to the next page. One of the things I liked most about this story was that Susannah was not the typical beauty that you find in most books. I read this book in one night and have passed it on to several friends and sisters who loved it just as I did.
3,Pretty Steamy!,"This book was amazing after the first initial chapters. I drug myself throught the first 5 chapters. It starts out really boring and i wonder why my best friend is telling me to read it. Then, out of the blue, they're going at it like crazy! It's pretty steamy when it gets to the ""intimate"" parts. I completely recomend this one! Eventually you will feel like you are Suzanna and Ian has just swept you off of your feet. It's pretty good stuff!P.S. This girl gets FREAKY!!"
5,Preacher's daughter meets bonded man with secret past,"This is a wonderful love story. Susannah is the ""old maid"" eldest daughter of a widower preacher. To help ease her workload, she decides to purchase a ""bound man."" She recklessly purchases Ian Connelly,a convict who has been badly beaten. While restoring him back to health, she develops an instant attraction to this stranger who is surprisingly well educated and very handsome. Ian has a secret past and identity, and this past is still trying to hunt him down. He works diligently to prove himself to Susannah, but she has difficulty pushing aside his status as her ""bound"" servant. The romance that develops between these two characters is so sweet and strong, that you will not be able to sert the book down until you've finished. I literally stayed up all night to read this book, it was that good. The story takes place in both America and England, during the days when convicts were shipped off to America to be sold as slaves."
4,A pretty good read!,"Karen Robards did a good job of telling her story about a family in the deep south in 1769. Most of us have little knowledge of the everyday life during that time so Robards did a good job of researching her subject. Religion plays a big part in the family life of a southern preacher--her father. His four daughters are who the story centers around. Susannah is the key person who shows southern hospitality and sweet innocence in the matter of the heart. The scene is ripe for her to be swept off her feet by a young dashing--reprobate. Robards spins her yarn telling how these two opposites' paths cross and love blossoms. This was a quick and interesting read. It has a wonderful twist on the prince charming subject. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about southern comfort, history, sibling rivalry and the rags to riches theme.--- Beverly C. Sanders"
3,"There have been better, there have been worse....","This was a well developed story about four sisters and their minister father who live and work on a farm in the late 1700's. Farm life, chores, and family values are the focus of this family's lifestyle. Out of a desperate need for help on the farm, the eldest daughter, Savannah, decides to purchase a ""bound-man"" (convict/slave), Ian.This book is enjoyable enough to keep you turning the pages, but the romance between Ian and Savannah is a bit far-fetched. Savannah's immature and hostile attitude becomes tiresome and I constantly wondered why Ian kept chasing after her.It's an original story, which makes it worth reading."
4,A great way to find out if this stuff's for you!,"Like everyone else, I've heard a lot about these 'nature sound' CDs. I was curious, but I wasn't sure if I'd actually like the stuff. I bought this sampler to help me decide, and I think it was a good choice. It offers nine tracks of highlights from other 'Echoes of Nature' albums. The tracks may be short (approx. 7.5 minutes each), but it's still a great way to decide whether you like this sort of thing, and what kind of sounds you're looking for. Personally, I was rather impressed at the quality of recording on such a cheap CD! While I'd be willing to bet that the sounds are re-mixed, they all sound quite real, the volume is constant throughout the CD, and for the most part there aren't any lengthy repetitive stretches which seem to plague other albums. If you're curious about this sort of CD, I'd highly suggest getting this one first!"
3,Not your typical CD...,"I popped this CD into my computer's CD-ROM drive and turned up the volume on my Sony speakers. I wanted to play the CD before I went to bed in an effort to relax my body, soul, and mind. During the first few tracks I dozed off into dreamland. I was awaken during the Jungle Talk track by the sounds of wild animals. I was afraid; I had forgotten all about the CD and I was appalled. Then I realized sitting in my dark room that I wasn't lost in the jungle, but that it was just Echoes of Nature. Immerse yourself in a truly exotic virtual reality experience."
1,blah!,i bought this cd at a thriftstore. glad i only gave a dollar for it. i'm giving it one star for ocean waves and thunderstorms. Autumn Breeze.
3,Some sweet songs,"I bought this for the one song, The Dance, hoping the rest would be as special. I was pretty disappointed as they all sound the same. Next time I'll sample an entire album first."
1,Garth really isn't that good!,"This album, like the rest of Garth's collection, is over rated for the most part. I respect his position and his fame, but when I listen to this album and others and I reminded that he is a commercial creation and not a talented artists.There is not a single song on this album that stays with you after listening to it. I really expected better of him! Tim McGraw is more heart and soul country - Garth tries but it falls flat.Unlike Elvis whose early tracks such as on Sun Records are classics, early Garth is not much better than later Garth.I'm sorry, but this album is a let down."
5,Timeless,"Imagine most pop singers available now-- the likes of Ricky Martin and Britney Spears-- ten years from now will we really appreciate their music as much as many people do now? In all likelyhood, the answer is no. But when I listened to his CD ten years after it debuted, I realized how timeless the songs were. I can understand how the critics are quick to slam his later CDs but one should think about the success that Garth had. He is selling millions and it is no wonder that the reviewers feel that it is unjust to become so more famous than particular singers they affirm to."
2,VERY AVERAGE,I'M Hardly A Fan OF Garth Brooks Music.cuz all of his Albums sound the exact same.in fact for me he has had only 5 Good solid songs for his Career.but two of them are Here on this Debut.The Dance which is a Great song.& If Tomorrow never comes.that songs is very honest.in fact My favorite of his.but the rest of the Album just Like the rest of His Music is pure Formula&Predictable.
2,Good debut album,"I am not a big fan of traditional country music, so this isnt among my favorite Garth CD's. However, it is a very good debut album overall. Includes the only song Garth ever wrote alone ""Not Counting You"" Also includes the classics ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" ""The Dance"", and ""Much Too Young To Feel This Damn Old"" Very good!!"
4,The Best Album Garth Put Out,"When Garth first hit the country music scene, it was back in '89 or '90. I remember first hearing him on the radio and was very delighted to hear something different and at the same time it was country.This debut album of Garth's convey's a whole other side of Garth.His version of, ""I Know One"" is beautifully done. Just wish he would have still done his music the way he started out; country."
4,Pretty good debut,The 1989 debut from Garth Brooks has its moments of greatness and then I feel that there are maybe one or two songs that are not that great on here. Overall it is an outstanding release the 4 hit singles were great. Much too young to feel this damn old to me being the best one. I think fans will also like maybe the first couple of non singles on this record like Everytime it Rains and Cowboy Bill I've got a good thing going are all very good. A strong release from Garth and if you own one of his records own this one.
2,"O.K. CD SOME SONGS ARE GOOD, MOST ARE AVERAGE!","Like most of Garth Brook's CDs, this one is average. The best songs on here are ""The Dance"" and ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"". Recording techniques using ultra modern equipment make anyone sound good but if you have ever seen this man perform live..and I have....he tends to go flat very often and cannot maintain his pitch. They can make anyone sound good on the records but the real proof of a good singer is in hearing them live. In Garth's case he does a lot of screaming and banging and breaking guitars but the man really cannot carry a tune to save his life."
2,"My son likes it, but delivery is so long!","I bought this for my 5 yo son. He likes it, but the deliver to forever to get the first issue and when they did deliver it, they sent it to my work address not my home. This is the second time this has happened. I will not be purchasing magazines from here anymore."
4,"a fine ""orchstral"" version of t.v. cop show themes","When I saw the original tape before the CD came out, I GRABBED it!. And, except for the ONE track I was seeking, it was a fine tape. I wanted the ORIGINAL music for Kojak, and presumeably because of the cost of providing the original soundtracks, the producers had an orchestra do the music and they had to inject their own ""dramatic license"", or they had to change it some small bit, not much, so it wouldn't be a copyright thing, which was FINE, it just wasn't what I hoped for... The CD was the same thing, and I GRABBED it also.....I just wish someone would do this using the ORIGINAL music...Please?!... Anyway, if you are into scores from detective TV shows this is a good as it is for now.....I recommend it."
1,Don't buy this book,"I found out I was having twins and ran to the bookstore. Having Twins...was the thickest volume I could find on the topic. Reading it left me depressed, paranoid and angry. As if this experience isn't difficult enough for a working-full-time soon- to-be-mother of three children under the age of THREE!!! Are there any books out there for real mothers? Elizabeth Noble is a crank who eschews medical science for a misplaced nostaglia for the good old days of home birth, home schooling, vegetables fresh from the garden and of course breastfeeding. None of these things are bad but most are largely impractical for working mothers in the 21st century. Thanks for the guilt Ms. Noble."
1,Just Terrible,I recieved this has a gift from my sister in law. I read some of this book one night. It left me scared and restless. The part about planting your placenta under a tree was very odd to say the least. This lady is a freak. I threw it in the garbage. I wouldn't sell it for a $1.00 I'd feel to guilty subjecting someone else to it. I wish I would have read these reviews before I opened it. If no stars was an option I would have put that. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!
1,HORRIBLE,"Shouldn't pregnancy books be unbiased, truthful and scientific? This book is the LEAST of all three. The author is overly opinionated, uses scare tactics and everything I was looking for WAS NOT found in this book.If you believe that formula will kill your baby, that circumcision is mutiliation that your child will never forgive you for, and that if you don't attachment parent your child, it will grow to be unemotional or emotionally retarted, then this book is for you.If you are looking for science and information to help you get through your pregnancy, look at another book. I am TAKING THIS BOOK BACK!"
2,Not the best choice,"This book is somewhat informative, but very negative. It is very anti-doctors, and scares you more than helps you. I would opt for another book."
1,Bizarre perspective,"I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago always gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."
1,Some interesting info under a lot of crazy talk,"While this book does provide some valuable information, it seems to me that the author can't resist throwing in a lot of opinion and judgment under the guise of fact. Her off the wall blanket statements can be quite offensive and detract from the points in the book that look as though they might otherwise have been useful. With every Say ""NO!"" to dairy, stop the mutilation of our boys through circumcision, or the doctors are ruining your pregnancy- I lost more faith in this author. I wish that I had chosen another book or read the reviews before I purchased this one."
1,I COMPLETELY agree with all the horrible reviews,"It didn't take reading these reviews to realize that I needed to return this book after attempting to get through it. What a HORRIBLE book. I can not wait to share these comments with my husband since it sounds like they were all written by me. Terribly opinionated and one sided. I strongly recommend no one wastes their money on this. I returned it to Barnes and Noble even after loosing the receipt and exchanged it for Everything you Need to Know to Have a Healthy Twin Pregnancy, which is a much better/healthier read!"
1,Horrible Book,"All the other reviews pretty much sums it up, but I think it should be noted that not only has Noble never been pregnant with multiples, she is a physical therapist, and Dr. Leo Sorger is her partner with whom she has had children with. Why she feels she is qualified to write this book is beyond me. I gave birth to twins at 38 weeks. One was 7.0 lbs, the other 6.1 lbs and I in no way followed any of the advice in this book."
1,Out of date statistics - up to date politics,"If you're looking for a nicely packaged sermon - you've found it. If you'd like to have someone tell you how to think, feel, reason, etc., Ms. Noble is game for that too. Unfortunately, I bought this new third edition book hoping to better educate myself about our upcoming twins. The advice ranges from judgemental to downright nasty. Some of the statistics are also FRIGHTENINGLY out of range from what I've read in recent studies. If you happen to have used any sort of assisted reproductive technology (from IVF to aspirin), make certain you don't read the introduction as it is particularly damning. I would say that the new addition has been updated in its political idealogy only, with little focus on improving the accuracy of the information."
5,Having Twins and MOre,"As a HypnoBirthing instuctor and childbirth educator, I think this is the best book out there for mom's expecting twins. I have read many books about having twins and most dwell on the risks and dangers of multiple birth. There are more risks involved in twin birth and a book would hardly be balanced if this were not mentioned. However this book is a positive statement to moms of muliples that they can have the natural vaginal birth they want in most cases. There are lots of stories of moms who have birthed naturally and successfully. There is much info about twins in general. This book gives moms hope that they can aviod cesarean birth most of the time. It tells when a cesarean is indicated and when it is not. A good thing to have if your doctor is induction or cesarean happy."
2,an author with an agenda,"This author clearly has her opinions--and negative ones directed at the medical community. Admittedly, while this author probably knows more than I do about twins (I'm still pregnant with mine), I felt as if I were reading an editorial at times rather than an informative book about being pregnant with, having, and raising twins. She's against circumcisions. She's against C-sections. She thinks mothers should take their twins to the doctor's separately (what??), etc., etc.. There are some helpful notes in the margins which are from parents of twins, but some of them were worrisome rather than helpful (""I thought everything was fine and I lost one twin at 12 weeks...""). I just happened to buy this book because it was among the first I had seen. Perhaps it was not my wisest choice."
1,I just threw it away.,"This is the worst book I have ever read about pregnancy, parenthood and multiple birth. The author seems to mistrust every healthcare professional, medical procedure and discourages common sense. With phrases like, ""Circumsizing terrorizes, terrorism circumcises,"" you can get your guilt trip without even leaving the house. Negative and disturbing."
5,A Vast Exploration,"This book is all over the place. It is refreshing to read a guidebook that reflects a vast exploration beyond the prevailing myths about multiple births. I like Noble's free range genius that presents evidence based data, stories, ideas, and an invitation to think outside of fear (and the complicity it engenders in parents of twins and more). HAVING TWINS has courage. The author takes the reader to the primal core and by educating us, more babies can be gently welcomed with love rather than viewed as medical emergencies waiting to happen."
1,why am i still reading this book?,"I continue to search the pages of this book for ""guidance."" All I seem to find are very negative, very opinionated statements on what the author wants to convey are the ONLY ways that you can carry, birth and raise twins. The last thing a parent of multiples needs is reading that they've been doing it wrong. We are all one step away from insanity in those first months and surely want to read something more objective and encouraging. Don't waste your time getting depressed from reading this book."
1,"This Book is Biased, Unscientific, and Unhelpful","I am pregnant with twins and I've read six books so far on pregnancy and this is the only book I've read that reads like an opinion column and not one based on any medical facts or published studies. Worse yet, the author presents her strong biases only and her views are not ones that are supported by the majority of OB/GYN doctors, including mine. Beyond the misinformation, I just did not enjoy this book at all and thought it was a big waste of money. Among other things, I was really offended by the author's preachy tone and lack of any factual support for her opinions on the evils of all milk and dairy products, circumcision, and C-sections for babies in the breech position. I did not learn a single thing from this book. There are so many other twin books out there and ALL of them are more helpful than this one."
1,be careful with this advice,"This author offers a lot of advice that, in my opinion, make a multiple-birth pregnancy more, rather than less, risky. With any multiple pregnancy you would be playing it safe to weigh the unconventional advice against the more conventional."
1,Hard to find good info,"I received this book as gift when I found out I was pregnant with twins. I am horribly disappointed. The author just fills the book with her radical left-wing opinions (like we should not drink another animal's milk, even cows!) She makes you feel like if you have to have a cesarean- you are already a failure as a mother! She also highlights people's regressed memories of fertilization and their loss of a twin before birth! Throughout the entire book she keeps reiterating the fact the having children in Europe is so much better than here in America. Well, like most people, I do not have a choice! The only reason I have finished the book is I kept hoping for some useful information. I never really found it!"
1,A Parent's Guide to Fear and Guilt,"Do not read this book if you are an expecting parent of twins unless you are looking a nightmarish exploration of medical challenges, frightening statistics, and guilt-inducing diatribes that--even if true--is by no means helpful. This book is written for academics and professionals, not parents. It has only encouraged us to fear the remainder of our pregnancy, the well-being of our first child, and the pains we will suffer in the afterlife for having resorted to fertility drugs to have children."
4,One of the best,"Dolly Parton is the most successful female recording artist in Country music, yet so few of her original labums are available on CD. This 1977 album is, perhaps, her most definitive of her later 70s albums. Great songwriting and singing add up to a fun and heartbreaking album."
2,Diappointed,I was disappointed in this product due to it being horribly warped. So far it plays OK but you can hear a distortion of the Music and Vocals.
1,Too much pop,"Bland and unorignal, this album contains too much of the slick pop that dominated Dolly's career duing the late 70's and early 80's. Now that she is beginning to embrace her roots again it is time to forget about this sad chapter in her career."
1,Unlistenable,"For anyone who has spent the past 20 years or so writing off Parton as merely an icon of American kitsch, this album is a big reason why. With this album Parton made a conscious effort to leave her country roots behind and go for the big bucks that bouncy and heavily produced pop had to offer and her credibility as a writer, and musician was lost for many years as a result. To make maters worse these songs sound very dated today and the whole thing is all but unlistenalbe."
2,"Unfortunately, only good for a solid overview","It covered all the topics you would expect, but it is mostly a just a good overview of .NET security. I expected more in-depth coverage for a book titled as such. It has only a very brief overview of encryption algorithms without enough real world examples in my opinion, being an advanced .NET programmer but new to the issue of security.The book is actually quite thin compared to its competition, so that should have tipped me off. You could go through it in a couple of days, but the price doesn't reflect that. I was really impressed with the .NET Programming with C# book from the same (small) publisher, so I was really hoping for a lot more. Consider the table of contents and decide for yourself whether this books warrants a purchase. It's a reasonably new topic of course so there are only a few other choices out there right now."
3,A terse introduction only...,"I bought this book in hopes it would add to the excellent information in the book "".NET Framework Security"".Alas, the book's various topics are only given lip service.If you're looking for a hard core analysis of code access security, only buy this as a secondary reference."
4,Score!,I was just in Maryland at the outlet stores over the weekendand I came across this in a music store. the cover caught myattention. great music samples if your not sure who to buy. END
2,BLACK CRSCENT MOON,The plot sounded intriguing but the acting and actual story line were just so-so. I have placed this one on the shelf and very likely will never watch it again unless absolutely bored to tears.
3,Useful but limited,"Buyer beware. As explained in the book's forward, ""this is not an all-new Survey. It is an Update...We have included 30 key places that were not in the previous Survey, as well as made changes to indicate new addresses, phone numbers, chef changes etc."" In other words, the reviews are similar or identical to those found in 1999.Also, note that ""more than 550 restaurants are covered with input from more than 560 people."" This is a pretty low reviewer-to-restaurant ratio, so the reviews do not necessarily reflect the input of many different opinions."
3,"Interesting, funny",Funny in a 1930's type of way. I enjoyed the use of slang and the descriptions of people. Very colorful.
5,Keyless entry remote,The replacement keyless entry remote worked perfectly after programming. Called tech support and they were fantastic! Was working in less than 5 minutes.
4,A Wonderful Album With Several 5-Star Songs,"An uneven third album, but still dizzying, dazzling and inspired. ""The River"" may just go down as one of the all-time great songs of hope and inspiration, while ""Papa Loved Mama"" is an all-out rowdy delight. ""What's She Doin' Now"" - pop melodrama of the tallest order - testifies yet again to Brook's vocal strengths, while ""Shameless"" (at least for me) falls flat, subpar even to its live versions. All in all, though, ""Ropin' the Wind"" stands as one of Garth's finest."
1,Ropin' the wind is the same as trying to find Garth's talent,"Why does this horrible garbage sell? This album is awful. Chris Gaines is better than this because it's more honest. This is ""poser"" country to use an old term.Ropin the wind is the same as trying to find talent in Garth. Or a reason to buy this cd."
5,Beginning to End-AWESOME!!,"This is one of those CD's you can throw in & press the ""repeat all"" button & just let it play over & over & over...!! Every song is great! You'll find yourself singing along to all of them in no time! This is a must have for all country music lovers! (I won't list off all of the songs since they do that above.)I have seen Garth 6 times in concert - 3 of those from the front row!! - This CD brings back all of the excitement of being there live!! Own it!-You'll be happy you do!1smileycat :-)"
3,Home Run Bat?,"This is the kind of film that requires a lot of popcorn..and some regular corn also. Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead liven up the proceedings and mercifully, the film runs about 70 minutes...with electric doors...and leather gloves that O.J. Simpson would admire.Of course the motive for all the goings on is revealed at the end...but....WATCH OUT FOR THAT BAT!!!"
3,"The Bat has great cast, great atmosphere.","The Bat is a remake of the 1930 film ""The Bat Whispers""--which itself was a remake of the silent film ""The Bat"". This version has the benefit of Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead leading the cast. Price is a writer who comes to spend the summer at a spooky mansion. A hooded, steel-clawed killer known only as The Bat is terrorizing the locals at the same time. Director Crane Wilbur builds great atmosphere and fans of the genre won't be dissappointed. The DVD is full-frame, with good but not spectacular audio."
3,kind of cheesy,"This is what we'd have called a ""B"" movie back in the fifties when I was a kid. I loved the ""B"" movies back then and I still do. Vincent Price is a little on the lame side, but Agnus Morehead does a very good job. The ending was a bit contrived, but not enough to ruin the movie."
5,SO BAD IT IS GREAT!,"When I was a kid, the local channel used to have Fright Night - this takes me right back to that time. I love this movie. It really is so bad it is great! Agnes Moorhead in spite of a terrible script shows what a great actor can bring to a role. Some of the dialogue is as campy as you can get. It's alot of fun too. Perfect for late night popcorn movie. Good companion double feature to the great original HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL."
5,"Excellent, readable translation, superb notes",This is an excellent piece of scholarship and a very readable translation. No collection of primary sources of the period is complete without it.
4,"""hahn-ting""","As it has been said, ""if you rememember the 60's, you weren't really there,"" but this recording may very well be your entry point! If you do remember and you're tired of the same old, same old Jimi Hendrix, John Coltrane, and Ravi Shankar sounds, give this one a try. ""In the Breeze"" shows off Jerry's bop chops. Certainly not a ""desert island disc"" but not bad for a ""throw-back"" event. Break out the herb!"
5,Every family should own,"I decided to get this cd after opening day of my daughters little league ceremony when they played this song. Baseball, kids, family, patriotic music, hot dogs, the crack of the bat, firefighters and policemen (real heroes). What a great cd. His interpretations of Americana classics hit the mark. Politically correct types will not like this (and who the hell cares) but those that are proud to be Americans and have not taken their flags down yet, this is a must have cd. The fourth of July is coming. 'AMerican Patriot' would be the perfect gift for the family and thus for the nation"
3,One hit wonder,"I was dissapointed that there were only a couple descent songs on here. That is what I get for an impulse purchase, I guess!!"
1,This cd wouldnt of sold if 911 didnt occur,"After 9-11, Americans bought flags, stickers, and banners to say that they love America so much. Music artist starting to cash in on the event by releasing songs about how much they loved America. This is why I stopped listening to country for awhile, false patriotism! If 9-11 didnt happen, Lee Greenwood's career wouldnt have be revived and this wouldnt of sold. American's wouldnt have so many bumper stickers saying ""we'll never forget"" or waving flags proudly. Greenwood can thank the events of 9-11 for reviving his career, without it this cd would be sitting on a Wal Mart shelf, gathering dust for $5.88."
5,God Bless America!!,This is an awesome CD. Timeless songs done in a great understated style. Perfect for teaching these great patriotic numbers to your kids (or for learning them yourself)! Actually finding a vocal version of Dixie on the cd was an extra treat.
5,God Bless Lee Greenwood!,"Ever since the attack on the US on September 11, 2001, I have been playing my Lee Greenwood CD. Lee Greenwood took a stance on patriotism in a time when it wasn't as important to us as it is now. We were a fragmented society, but after the attack, our nation, in mourning, sharpened its focus and dropped the many adjectives defining ethnicities. Gone are the labels of Latin-Americans and African-Americans. Now we are all just ""Americans.""Thanks, Lee, for your heart-felt songs that honor our wonderful country. I, too, am proud to be an American.God Bless the U.S.A.Valerie"
4,American Patriot ~ Lee Greenwood,More than at any time in my memory of the United States this CD should be in EVERY American home. The events of Sept 11th 2001 will live forever in the minds of people across this land. Feel the surge of patriotism every time you listen to this CD. Give thanks to those who have fought and/or died to provide us the freedom we enjoy.I can't think of a more wonderful way to share the joy and pride of Your Great Nation with your family and friends than to sing with Lee Greenwood our most beloved anthems.
5,Does he have esp?,"In this time of conflict,this is a must.I am buying another CD, because I plan to share with everyone the true beauty that is the Pledge of Allegiance.Lee Greenwood must have had a vision because this song alone explains it all - ONE NATION UNDER GOD!"
3,"A decent account of Carnegie, Frick & Homestead","The book is fairly well-written & is easy to read. As far as it goes, it is an accurate account of the often tumultuous relationship between Carnegie & Frick, focusing of course on the Homestead Strike.Standiford does a reasonably good job of fleshing out the personalities of the key actors in the drama. While hardly a definitive study of the period, this book would serve well as an introductory work into this particular subject."
4,Meet You in Hell,"For anyone who loves history this is a good read, especially if you enjoy reading about the industrialists who, rightly or wrongly, packed so much influence into their time. It reads even better if you're from the areas in Western PA where they weilded their combative and contentious power"
4,The greed of two men was what caused the conflict.,"I enjoyed this book very much. I think the author tried to rope in the conflict at Homestead as the reason for the split of these two greedy capitalists. Their conflict was due to want of money, not the position of what was best at Homestead. Frick wanted to wage war on his employees, while Carnegie wanted to starve them out. I don't think there is much difference. However, the conflict at Homestead showed how these early venture capitalists were unconcerned for their employees. Make big money, and reduce costs (employee wages) and get rich in the process.This is the sad tale of two wretched men who destroyed the lives of thousands. They were successful, but at a cost. I hope that they do speand a eternity where they deserve it most. I think the author did a good job of detailing the conflict at Homestead, and what mattered. This is history that is no longer covered in schools, but should be."
3,Lastest forever...,"I had to read this book for school, so my views could be skewed. I just thought the book was wayyyyyyyyyyyy to long, but it was interesting. It is sort of depressing how our society does not learn from others like him and try to better ourselves we just keep on trying to better the ones that we believe had it all like him."
4,Funny flick,This is a pretty funny movie. Definitely the funniest documentary I've seen. I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie. You gotta see it - it's fun to laugh at star wars geeks.
1,These aren't the droids you're looking for...,"Complete garbage. While it starts out trying to cover STAR WARS fans waiting for the release of PHANTOM MENACE, it goes off on many wild and uninteresting tangents, and ends with some clouded message about young men without fathers who like Star Wars. A waste of time. Check out STARWOIDS for a better look at this subject."
2,Move along... nothing to see here,"I guess I'm not sure what I expected but the book does not live up to the hype. The book seemed more about a phase in Mlodinow's life; Feynman, Gell-Mann, Helen, and the garbageman neighbor just happened to be there at the time -- like the cast of a play. Getting an insight into physics from reading this book is like learning about bartending by watching Cheers, or medicine by watching Scrubs. It's a good, light read, reminiscent of a well-told recount of an eventful personal vacation."
5,Feynman's Rainbow,"EXCELLENT!!! Gives the layman a look inside the world of Physics research, while presenting a life-lesson theme that transcends science. A great read for both science and non-science readers. I'm a Physics teacher, and the reason I love this book has absolutely NOTHING to do with science. I'm making it required reading for my Physics classes!!"
2,What do you care what other people think?,"Mlodinow's book is more about himself than about Feynman, whom he admits he hardly knew. There are no insights here into Feynman's character, or his personality, or the incredible story of his marriage to Arline. Nope, this book is mostly the author boasting about graduating early, writing a well-respected thesis, and being expected to excel. It should have been called ""Mlodinow's Rainbow"" but I guess that wouldn't have sold as many copies, would it?Don't get me wrong. The book is entertaining enough, and short enough (171 pages of large type) to be quickly devoured in a single sitting. Just don't expect there to be anything of substance about the name in the title, which is obviously a marketing ploy."
3,Not totally disappointed,"This was an easy read however if you are looking to know Feynman, you may be disappointed. In reading the back cover, I expect more about Feynman and less about the author. But I was not totally disappointed, the book was well written and could be digested in one sitting."
1,Mlodinow's rainbow,"This book has nothing to do with Feynman, it is a book in which the author boast about what he did in his PhD thesis and tries to justify his choices of not doing science full-time (perhaps because not good enough.. don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad in it). I find pathetic the way the author uses Feynman's name to get attention and selling books. Not worth the money."
4,Thought on Feynman's Rainbow,I recently read the book Feynman's Rainbow. I really enjoyed this book and I thought it was very interesting. I learned about quantum chromodynamics and the electromagnetic force. I alo learned about Murray Gell-mann's ideas about quarks. I also learned about Joyhn Schawartz's string theory and the thoughts that Richard Feynman had on them. Leonard Mlodinow had an interesting encouter with Richard Feynman while they were both faculty at Caltech. The author used very personal experiences to tell his story of his experience at Caltech. The book keeps the reader engaged and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in physics or Richard Feynman.-Devon Harris
5,Guidance for the blind,"As a physicist-turned-freelance writer, this book struck home for me in a big way. Mlodinow addresses issues that every budding scientist must deal with in his or her own way, and I would personally recommend that anyone exploring a career in science read this.The book explores a lot of common misconceptions about scientists and specifically, physicists, by following Mlodinow's own personal story. In this way he manages to show the reader some of the more common pitfalls of the young science enthusiast in ways that could be life-changing to the right people. I only wish I had read this as a student at MIT; perhaps it wouldn't have been so difficult for me to arrive where I am if I had that opportunity back then."
4,"Good insight into Feynman, the professor","I had read about Feynman only in books written by him, or through his published lectures. This was the first book I read about Feynman from the perspective of somebody who knew him first hand, more specifically as a junior, in some sense a mentee. I enjoyed reading about the author's honest portrayal of the insecurities he faced as a kid just out of college and his interactions with Feynman in an indirect effort to overcome those."
5,Another piece of the puzzle,"I enjoyed this book immensely and feel that it adds another facet to an overall portrait of Richard Feynman. No one book is ever going to have it all, the physics, the bio, the insight, but this adds a very appealing view from one who was at least on the same floor at CalTech as Feynman himself. As the Zen Master said, it is when something is dying that it is the greatest teacher and in this book Feynman is dying but he's going out the same way as he lived and there is a lot to be learned from him. He gives the author a push toward living in his own skin and finding his own path and does it with the directness that always characterized Feynman. Words to live by? When Feynman tells Leonard that if he's unhappy he should think about that but that when he's happy just let it be and on't question it."
2,"Interesting, but not enough ""book material""",I would only read it if you want another view at Feynman's life. Keep in mind that half the book is autobiographical and not too interesting
4,Feynman as seen by a peer,"Written by a physicist who spent a year in an office on the same floor as Feynman and Murray Gell-Man, this book provides yet another view of Feynman and the love-hate relationship that existed between him and Gell-Man, two of the finest physicists of the 20th Century. It is interesting to compare this view with the one provided by the letters collected by his daughter, Michelle,Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From The Beaten Track: The Letters Of Richard P. Feynmanand the excellent, but hard to find, collection of essays written by other peers.""Most of the Good Stuff:"" Memories of Richard Feynman."
1,Mlotinow's Rainbow,"Don't buy this book thinking it's about Feynman; it's really all about the author, a whiny sycophant who attached himself to Feynman at Caltech while the professor worked in his final years. Mlotinow offers precious little from Feynman, while going on interminably about his inability to find a purpose in his work, his pot-smoking buddies and an especially excruciating bit about a false-positive testicular cancer diagnosis. The few-and-far-between anecdotes and quotes from Feynman are nuggets, but there's really nothing here that can't be found in Surely You're Joking or What Do You Care What Other People Think.If you're looking for information about and from Richard Feynman, read the two titles listed above. If you want to find out about quantum theory or string theory, read The Whole Shebang by Timothy Ferris or The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene. Take a pass on this one."
3,Moderate Bag with a Stink,"It appears that this bag is actually a generic bag with an embroidered S&W; logo rather than an official S&W; product. Oh and be sure you air it out because this bag smells AWFUL upon arrival.Regardless, it certainly suits my needs and is able to transport my equipment quite well. The zippers are big and reliable (though not quite the size to fit my locks) and the pouches are prolific. I like the idea of a movable divider but have found that I prefer not to use since it usually just gets in the way (the velcro doesn't hold up against the weight of the weapons). Shoulder strap is well positioned and makes carrying quite easy."
1,don't care for,The rain sounded more like something frying in a pan and all the same all the way threw didn't care for.Thanks
3,Catholic Book of Days,"This book is well written, but it is not relevant to me...over 50, no children. The readings deal with family life joys and problems, most of which I have not experienced. Therefore, I cannot draw meaning from the devotions. Also, the devotions seem to be mostly the story of her life, not any good advice for me. A young woman with children...a stay at home mom...would probably benefit from this book."
4,Daily Inspiration,This book is great for Mom's who find themselves waiting for their children and need a boost of faith filled inspiration. I enjoy reading daily -- and each day helps me to focus spiritually.
3,Not His Best,This is a fairly uninspired outing by Albert. The vocals are weak and the backing band members are sound muffled. Booker T. and the MG's are not present on this album. If you don't have any Albert King albums stick with the classics (i.e. King of the Blues Guitar and I'll Play the Blues for You). If your collection is already fairly extensive and you still want more Albert then this would be acceptable.
1,Sticks out to the side of your face,these earrings do not lay right. It looked like I was taking off from outer space!!!!
3,Reality hurts sometimes,I was surprised that Ms. Heinie was a drunk and mean and vindictive. It was a life that was about her and her only. Not a very good example of using the gifts one was given by God and hurting people consistently during your life. She is not someone I would have looked up to or wanted to know.
4,Fun toy,"Works great, pretty fun and I dont have any complaints. I like the touch screen and the interface is easy to see and use."
1,Total junk,"Got this as a gift for my wife and it didn't work out of the box. And amazon won't take it back or give refund because it contains ""hazardous"" materials. Very disappointed in the product and amazon."
2,i don't like my electronic sudoku,"this is a disappointment, i expected better clarity and brightness. it's sitting collecting dust. I wouldn't recommend this specific unit."
5,Perfect,It was exactly the correct battery. It saved tons of time running around the mall trying to find it! And it was a lot cheaper too
5,Perfect for falling asleep,"This CD puts me to sleep -- which is a good thing. In addition to the babbling water, there are bird and other forest sounds, but nothing is too loud or jarring. I put this in my CD player, press 'repeat' and drift away. If you share a house with snorers, it's either environmental recordings like this one or earplugs!"
1,Was looking forward to receiving this...,"but it sounds like running bath water. I too have had exposure to real woods, real rivers - this is not it."
5,Weekend athlete,I received this book as a Christmas gift from my daughter. I was skeptical at first that Pilates could help out a weekend softball player like myself. As a new years resolution I work out 3 times per week at home. Through the first 3 weeks of the year I have lost 10lbs via working out with IM=X and a new diet. It's a great workout and I don't have to worry about injuring my arm lifting heavy weights at the gym. Thanks to McNergney for this wonderful program.
5,"Not an Idol, just a toy","I love these Wee 3 Friends. A much better alternative to Barbie. These dolls bring a smile to my daughters face and I don't have to worry about her wanting high healed shoes! The legs bend and the faces show a much more young, happy look. Your child will love them. I believe these are new and there are not a lot of clothes options yet. But I think they will be making more."
5,Get lost Bratz,"These dolls are the best thing ever. What I want to know is, how can people NOT like these dolls? I mean, yeah, they DO have (...) and curves, but so what? So do I, and I'm only 11. Okay, whoever would buy Bratz or My Scene instead of Wee 3 Friends is mentally challenged. YOU KNOW WHAT BRATZ REPRESENTS???????? That it's good to be a bad girl. HELLO! These dolls are ANOREXIC! And My Scene just plain shows sexuality. Wee 3 Friends shows how great it is to be a kid! Do you want your lil' girl to be thinking about boys 24/7? BUY WEE 3 FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Who writes 'Get Lost Bratz' review...your wrong,"I know different people comes with different opinion. But I think My Scene is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy cooler than Barbie.Bratz are better than Barbie, and what's up with the 'MAN'S' name.Ken???? Eeeeeewwwwwwwww!!!! I think that is the stupidest name I ever heard."
5,Best damn blues LP/CD ever! With props to the two below.,"My favorite Albert King LP, 'cause, it has the Stax/Barkays folks on it and it is definitely phonkay, dig? It has the title cut, which is like the Cadillac Mack Daddy's theme song--plus it has my favorite creepin' days (when I was younger, of course) song ""Breaking Up Somebody's Home""...and the great ""I'll Be Doggone"". It's good damn blues done damn right."
3,Hard to read,This book was written in old style language. Very hard to read. If you are reading for pleasure and want something quick do not start this book.
3,aight,its okay its watery consistency...good for hair...if u have a special use for jojoba oil then go for it but u probably would want more...if not then dont bother. i wouldnt buy it again but i dont hate it either
4,An excellent journey,"Boredoms new album feels like a long trip. A winding, tribal, sun-worshipping, occasionally spastic (but nothing like before) quest. Beautiful quiet sections, fascinating stuttering noise, fields of drums. Track numbers mark more than an hour of mostly uninterrupted music. A delicate track separated from the rest at the end. My only complaint is that, as on their magnum opus ""super ae"" (or ""super are""), the recording is a bit flat. With so much aural animation, the disc deserves more depth, especially in splitting the laminated rhythms. To be listened to in its entirety, every time."
5,Excellent follow up to Super Are,"Vision Creation Newsun follows the new course the boredoms took with Super Are into long rock-trance sonic collages. I don't know of any other music produced today that is simultaneously so experimental and exciting. Although miles apart stylistically, Vision Creation Newsun excites and uplifts the listener in the same fashion as the John Coltrane Quartet did. You really don't care how long the songs are, because every second is bursting with energy and creativity. My favorite album from this year."
2,Could have been much better,"This book has a few scattered pieces of very nice concept art, but on the whole I was dissappointed. A lot of the art is pretty sloppy, even by ""concept art"" standards. The most dissappointing part of the whole book though is the presentation. Many of the images have the pixelated look of low-res digital art that has been blown-up way beyond acceptable range. Also, the binding is coming apart on the book I have despite limited use so far."
5,Beautiful piece of work from Blizzard,It's a book that gives great inspiration. It's a great piece of work and it's now one of the main books in mine and my bride's collection of concept art. Is stunning to have the root art of a such massive and beautiful game.
3,Good for an artbook shipped with the game.,"Not the best ""Art of..."" book I have ever purchased. I use the book mainly to understand the style and direction of blizzard's art, and to be honest there could have been alot more art shown. Several pictures throughout the book are grainy and clearly enlarged to fill space, there is rarely any insight from the artists, and you don't get to see the stages of design.If you are buying this for the artwork rather than just a casual glance through, make sure you get it at a good price."
5,Oversize Jug,"Hi,This hone worked perfectly! I had to go up to the first overbore, on the cylinder on my vintage 1974 S3 400 Mach ll Kawasaki Triple 2-stroke. That meant honing out 0.50mm or .020 thousandths + another .003 thousandths for piston to wall clearance. It took about an hour, but the cylinder came out straight with no taper in it. It's running fine. I'll be running it at the Bonneville Salt Flats next month, look for #3121 PP . Thanks again!Joe"
5,Enlightening,"This is a magnificent work. It focuses light upon what has been dark too long. It also brings General Semantics into the mainstream in a useful, logical manner vs. some of the more technical GS literature which seems questionable from a scientific perspective. True, the author is a strong proponent of psychic phenomena. But, a true scientist keeps an open mind and the literature is growing and convincing in these areas. For example, the illustrious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) did a rigorous study on telepathy and published the sender's randomly selected photographs right next to the receiver's hand drawn responses. The results were VERY convincing. But, ESP is NOT the main thrust of this book. Rather, it is an attempt to integrate and extend intuitive reasoning minds through the past and into the near future. I'm impressed."
3,"important to read, but boring","I read this book after reading The DaVinci Code, as the Age ofAquarius was mentioned.This book should be required reading in all religions. The bookoffers 50 Insights to help people make sense of the world.Most people do their best to live by religious principles, without questioning the religious principles. Most people do and think what they do because that's what they were taught."
5,Useful and concrete advice,"This book explains that people who are targets of verbal abuse aren't helpless, and provides them with strategies for verbal self-defense. The approach is not ""blaming"" the targeted individuals -- it's empowering them. Elgin has never suggested, either in print or aloud, that verbal abuse victims are responsible for the hostile language environments that make their lives miserable, but she has told them how to take control and cure their environments. This book teaches that at a level written to those who need it most."
1,Don't buy this book!,"What a waste! I agree with the other reviewers. This book might be of some (limited) benefit in dealing with verbal jabs from people with whom you have limited contact or limited emotional investment. But, her assertion that these techniques will defuse all but the most egregious verbal abusers is so absurd that it makes me wonder if she's ever been in the same room with one. Don't waste your time or money. A MUCH BETTER option would be Patricia Evans' ""The Verbally Abusive Relationship."" Evans addresses the problem, from why it happens to how to recognize it to what you can and can not do about it. Elgin tries to create a Pollyanna world where the abuser will respond logically and like a ""sane"" human being. If that were the case, you wouldn't be considering this book in the first place."
4,Extremely Useful Resource,"I found Elgin's techniques to be extremely helpful when I was struggling with remaining in an abusive situation. They helped me recognize, analyze, and divert the verbal abuse. Although it did not cure the abuser of the need to abuse, it did change the abuse to more open and easily recognized forms, that made the final solution more obvious. These techniques have been extremely useful in other instances of verbal abuse from healthy individuals, and have changed the mode of communication of those individuals towards me for the better. She gave me the power to control my language environment, and to remove myself from toxic language."
1,This is not about true abuse,"I was deeply disappointed in this book. I am desperate to find some effective strategies for dealing with a verbally and emotionally abusive parent. The author makes one good point: that what abusers want is to get attention and a ""rise"" out of you. But her strategies for avoiding this are *only* useful for very *mild* cases. I laughed out loud at some of the techniques she thinks would work. She clearly does not know my abuser. She herself does note this, by saying that some people have an underlying problem that has to be solved before the abuse will stop. But what to do in that case? Her only answer is that you may have to leave, and of course one can't ""leave"" a parent. She completely ignores that the verbal abuser is usually blackmailing you in a very effective way until you give in to them. Ultimately, the book is misnamed. This is not about verbal *abuse,* but simply about becoming more effective communicators with normal people."
3,some very practical tips,"This book could have provided the useful material in about one-fourth of the length, which is why I rated it down. What I got out of it that is helpful to me includes the following. Never feed the verbal violence loop - use neutral intonation and impersonal language (the 2 main keys to her theory). Also that we need to realize that, ""Letting verbal abusers' insults and smart cracks and hurtful remarks go by isn't letting them get away with it. Allowing them to succeed in their goal of tying up your attention and getting an emotional reaction from you is letting them get away with it."" I also found helpful some specific ""language stategies"" to use for getting up and leaving when the conversation is hostile and apparently going nowhere."
1,Facile and simplistic,"The author's recommendation for responding to verbal abuse from a spouse or significant other amounts to ""cleverly change the subject, and all will be well"". That might work with small children, but it doesn't work with abusive spouses. The author's prescription reflects a breathtaking lack of appreciation for what the victims of verbal abuse are subjected to, day in and day out, often for many hours at a time and with no meaningful way to escape, and is quite reminiscent of 'just say no' as a cure for drug addiction. I think that a good deal of the problem comes from the lack of a clear distinction between abuse and occasional crankiness. The author's word games may offer a polite way of deflecting the latter, but as to the former they are a surefire prescription for continuing to be abused. I don't know what the solution is, but you won't find it in this book."
5,Good Advice,"I really enjoy all of her books, although the repetitiveness is a bit annoying. This one has more new information in it than the others."
2,Not helpful...too wordy and the scenarios are a bit ridiculous,"I couldn't get through more than a couple chapters...the rest I scanned through and realized it wasn't for me. The scenarios she uses are silly. In short, this book is about the cause and effect of verbal communication. The wife is angry and verbally abusive, so the husband 'catches' that and passes it on to his coworkers...and so forth. She is trying to basically dissect how a person says something will affect people in different ways depending on HOW they say it. Isn't that obvious? I think the only people this book would help is those who find themselves snappy towards others."
1,"MISSES THE MARK, DO NOT READ!","WEAK ADVICE by someone with no clue of the irrational situation in true Verbal Abuse. This is more of a self-help manual for normal relationships. Verbal Abuse is different -- you cannot stop the abuse, nothing will work. Abusers lack empathy. After I escaped a traumatic marriage, I read all I could, to deal with my pain and confusion. THIS BOOK IS USELESS -- do not read it! Especially if you're in trouble and need help. MUCH BETTER BOOKS EXIST to help you! ""The Verbally Abusive Relationship"" by Patricia Evans, and ""Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"" by Lundy Bancroft. Do reach out! We survivors are here, hoping you will soon choose to open your eyes, learn the facts, begin to love yourself, and realize how abnormal it is to be hurt by the one who should love and cherish you."
5,Underrated GEM!,"This is the album that featured the blockbuster ""When You tell me that you love me""! This is one of Ms. Ross greatest albums in the 90's. Diana Ross is splendid in ""Blame it on the sun"" (Stevie Wonder) & ""The Force Behind the power"" will sure lift you from your seats... Other great love songs such as ""Heart don't change my mind"" & ""One Shining Moment"" are here. This album has been overlooked and underrated by many critics... a decade later it shows that it is a gem & Diana Ross was really inspiring. Recommended."
2,Fine selection of tunes but not one of the better CDs.,"Unfortunately, the tune selection is good but the listening quality is not. I had to turn my CD player way up to get any kind of depth. The lack of clarity alone causes me not to reach for this CD. There are other CDs available with more talent and clarity. Too bad, because there were some good traditional tunes on the CD."
2,The worst bagpipe CD I have listened to yet.,"I got this for me birthday as I am a HUGE fan of bagpipe music. The first songs I listened to were absolute rubbish. They absolutely butchered some of my favorite songs like ""The Mist Covered Mountains"" and ""Amazing Grace""."
3,Great Practice CD!,This CD really does have some great things for individual practice -- rhythms and tempi. Those other people don't know what they were talking about.
2,not very good,The recording quality was not very good. There are much better recording of this great singer.
3,"Good multi-cultural DVD, Not intended for teaching Spanish","English-speaking parents note: Plaza Sesamo not designed to teach Spanish. Like English Sesame Street, it engages and entertains kids who already speak Spanish. (Grover is HILARIOUS in any language.) This DVD focuses on body parts. Good for vocabulary reinforcement. The videos of actual kids show a diversity of Latino images. My boys shout each others' names when they see a child that looks like their brother. (One has blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin. The other has brown hair, eyes and skin.) The live-action studio segments have very scripted, somewhat unnatural child actors - my kids don't seem to relate to them. The animated segments like the Spider Picasso and Teeth Brushing Orchestra are really fun for our toddlers. Gracias Plaza Sesamo"
4,Like a low-budget Sesame Street episode,"Like any Sesame Street episode, this video is split up into short skits.Some of them are re-used material from old Sesame Street episodes from the 1980s and they just dubbed Spanish-speaking music over it.Other skits that have puppets (Cookie Monster) are also old skits with the voices dubbed over in Spanish.The only skits that appear to be original content have low production values on cheap-looking sets.However, it's still the same quality content you'd expect from Sesame Street, so it gets four stars.Due to its low price, it's a good value for an immersion Spanish video."
4,cute spanish dvd,"this is a cute spanish dvd, my daughter seems to enjoy it at the age of 2, but she loves any tv. it's cute to see the spanish versions of sesame street though. i'm sure my daughter will learn a few spanish words."
3,Not for a toddler who is learning spanish,"I rated this item in the lower range because I though my 2 1/2 year old could learn more spanish with this video. Definitely is designed for kids that are already fluent in the language. The conversation is quite difficult to follow for a 2 1/2 year old who is just learning spanish. Perhaps is for older kids 4 or 5. However, it does entertain my toddler and she likes all the characters in the video. For the beginner learner i found thatBrainy Baby - Spanishwas a better choice."
1,Bloody well bites,This cd bloody well bites. I got a bloody right to say. Bites It bloody well bites
1,Simply the worst possible,"How can somebody be so far from deep, real, thought-provoking musci? I don't think anybody knows. Garth Brooks epitimises terrible music, there is no way that you can get any worse. No possible way. Not even pop like Britney Spears and N' Sync is worse than is worse than him. If there was one kind of music that I wish never existed, it would be country. I mean, WHAT EXACATLY IS SO GOOD ABOUT IT?!?!?!"
3,Garth Brooks Fan,I got this CD out and played it and really like it again I like the song Unanswered prayers
2,Bad...but not as bad as it has gotten,"This cd is Garth still a bit innocent and trying different styles. While bland, it still is not nearly as arrogant as his later releases such as the song, ""It was your song"" from the live, 2 cd set. That song is 1% talent and 99% ego. This cd is better only in comparison to how far he would fall afterwards."
3,Half,"I wanted to rate this latest release half, (three stars), because Pinoccio only has one woman to complete him right now. This is really starting to show through in his latest cd. The old stuff was FAR better. I love Garth's old stuff.When Garth meets the other women he desperately needs in his life, and becomes ""a real boy"" - I will give Pinoccio five stars. I'm sure his music will improve then.Isn't that what life's all about? Do a little memory dance through life, pat your wife on the head for being a good sport, and keep truckin until the next stop? What an ego! I am asking, because I am not as old as him yet, and I am still trying to learn.His ex-wife may not be a glamorous singer, but she must be an amazing woman to devote her life towards his happiness.I guess Hollywood will make a movie soon, and try to make her look evil or something."
1,Rammed An Ice-Pick Instead,"I fought off the urge to ram a turkey baster in my ear - but thought an ice-pick might relieve the pain of listening to this CD even more. To call this CD an abismal piece of drivel would be to disrespect things that truly are abismal pieces of drivel. Shucks this is even worse. ""The Thunder Rolls"" is as overblown as it is insulting to the listeners's intellegence. Garth - your fans can't handle any questions more difficult than 1) where's the beer?, 2) did you gamble away the welfare cheque again, Clem?, 3) if my wife divorses me, is she still my sister?"
1,I would rather ram a turkey baster in my ear than listen to,"this again. Rebel yells, monster truck pulls, and rodeos are the only things that this album is good for. Maybe I too can aspire to live in a single wide, drink Bud, and watch wrestling all day. Hopefully that day won't be soon."
4,Good Music...period!!!,"Garth is a fantastic songwriter! My wife and recently started listening to country music and WOW...it's addicting. Get this Cd, sit back and enjoy!"
5,This album is the best he has ever released.,"This album is the best because of the different performance Garth gives to the audience, unlike his others. Even though success has come to Garth through selling millions of albums, he hasn't changed his priorities."
5,"Garth, at his very best.","This album packs a punch, with mega hits like The Thunder Rolls and Friends in Low Places. Representitive of his older style, this is an album that is sure to please even the most timid country music fans. If you like Garth, you'll love this album! You can sing along with most of the songs and it has a little of everything in it."
5,Can't say enough about Bobby.......,"Great, great collection. Too bad that Bobby isn't appreciated more. But this is certainly a good start. Missing alot of what Shaun says above. Need a little Odessa or Salt Lake City... Like I said, many missing songs. But, still a great, great collection."
4,Nice product,"I was a little skeptical at first, but this thing really does grow some nice plants. I have been enjoying fresh basil and mint lately, and they are very nice and quite flavorful."
4,Kitchen herbs sprouting right on schedule,"The seed packages state the likely time for contents to sprout and, after three weeks of hydroponic effort, everything is precisely on schedule. Another two weeks pass before the harvest begins. Then, we'll be enjoying fresh, organic herbs, grown under our own supervision. So far, the Aerogarden is working exactly as advertised. The water tank had to be refilled after the first two weeks and new nutrients were needed at the same time. Separate warning lights indicated the need for those things to be done. Now, we just watch the grass grow. Not the most exciting activity, but the herbs are plentiful."
2,Mold!!! aka White Fuzz on my pods and roots,I use well-filtered water and followed the directions to grow herbs and then salad greens. both have failed. why? white fuzz aka fungus/mold. even tried to pull out any seed casings or seeds that did not sprout to avoid the mold. kept water levels high at all times. even added hydrogen peroxide to the reservoir. failed!! called support at aerogrow and they said they cant do anything about it except send another seed kit and I should disinfect the system again. did disinfect with hydrogen peroxide not bleach for my second planting. very disappointing...salad greens look like they are limp and dying. roots are becoming brown. mold is greatly reduced however salad greens look sick and dying. will try to plant my third set of seeds after using chlorine bleach this time. very frustrating. no clear answers. would not recommend purchasing the aerogrow. i unfortunately stuck with the pro200.
3,Not quite as much output as I would have liked.,"I'm sure others will pipe in with more thoughts, this is just a brief comment.This is very small, somehow I had pictured it larger. I thought I was going to be able to have enough lettuce to meet my needs. What I have is a few gourmet lettuce leaves a day. They are wonderful and the thing is a lot of fun and nice looking but it just doesn't produce much lettuce.I have not tried any other seeds yet.That said, being the only person in the house eating greens means that I can have the lovely tender lettuce leaves that I couldn't before because I couldn't eat the whole grocery store package fast enough.Love,Marianne"
5,Made a great gift for the cook in my life,"I've seen reviews where DIYers complain it's easily made, but if you're giving this kit to someone as a gift they're probably gardeners or cooks, and would probably appreciate the simplicity and effectiveness of the kit. They grow quickly and abundantly - the demo photo isn't an exaggeration. After the first crop, maybe you should look into making your own seed pods, but regardless this made a great gift."
1,Not so green thumb!,"Aerogarden doesn't live up to it claims. Plants on outside corners underperform. I contacted Aerogarden directly and they sent me a new pump, which means you have to disassemble the unit and take the plant pods out to install. New pump doesn't seem to make much difference. Save your $ and grow your herbs outside during growing season!"
1,"Pump stopped working after 1 Month, my plants are now going to die.","The Aerogarden was going great until today when the pump stopped working. I did some searching on the net and found others have the same problem. The pump needs to be replaced, I wrote Amazon to see if they are going to replace or refund my money for the Aerogarden. I am not very happy, especially when many other have the same problem with defective units. Buyer beware, you may want to wait a year or two until they perfect this system. Who want to watch their plants die because of a bad pump, then after they die you have to put in a new pump and start all over again.I don't think they even tested many of these units before they sold them to the public. How could a problem like this happen to so many people if they did proper testing? And if they did test them out good, they must not care about selling a quality product.My final thought is it works well at first, but does not last long."
4,3 Year Old Will Eat His Veggies!,"My 3 year old hated lettuce before we purchased the Aerogarden. After watching the leaves grow, he is always asking for the lettuce. We no longer have problems getting him to eat his salads and he loves to snack on the leaves! We all do!The only downside- the outside leaves are not that pretty, and the lettuce does not stay lush and full. But it's still great to look at. Customer service is also great and they quickly sent replacements for the seeds that did not sprout.Follow-up! I called aerogarden and let them know about my not so pretty outer lettuce leaves after about 6 weeks of growth. They immediately sent a replacement seed kit. The new seed kit has grown VERY full and lush, much better than the first kit. I was told to call back with any problems. Customer service really wants you to be completely happy. I am impressed! Make that 5 stars!"
5,BLAM! We have veggies!,"I love this little thing! I have successfully grown veggies in my kitchen and they look great. Except the Cilantro and Dill didn't sprout, so it ain't perfect I guess ... still love it though.We plugged it in, placed in the pods, pressed the button for what we were growing and {POOF!} we haven't touched it, other than adding water and the little tablets everyonce and a while.Like others mentioned it puts off a lot of light ... almost like a Flood Light in the Kitchen at night. So be careful where you put it at night."
5,Amazing Product,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we both are amazed at the quality of this product. Our first 'planting' was tomatoes and 4 days later we have sprouts. This is easy to use with no mess.The only thing I'd like to see done differently is the ability to grow multiple products (i.e., tomatoes, salad, herbs) at the same time. Currently, you can only grow the same item at one time.Update: 3 months laterThis thing is noisy. The pump is making an awful racket and am afraid it will fail soon...have contacted the manufacturer for a replacement and I hope the customer service horror stories I've seen so far have been resolved."
4,Cute Little Garden,I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves to cook using different herbs and grows herbs in a garden in the summer. Now he can grow them year round. He was really pleased with this garden and it is growing exactly as they said it would. The only reason I didn't give it a five is because the light is so extremely bright that we moved it around several times before we found a suitable place for it. I guess the plants need that light but it was way too bright to leave in the kitchen. I am pleased with this item and would buy it again.
4,aero review,"Stylish and easy to set up. Unfortunately one of the seven pods didn't do anything but turn to mold. Guess they should check their ""dill"" crop. And the lights don't stay off for 8 hours; 7 is more what I have experienced. Otherwise, we'll see as I await results."
5,AeroGarden is wonderful,"I've purchased my fair share of gadgets over the years, the AeroGarden gets a GOLD medal. It is flawless. It is easy to assemble, It took me less than 10 minutes. Planting was equally easy, I just dropped the little canisters in the appropriate spots and plugged it in. Within a week the various herbs were sprouting as advertised. It is so exciting. I do not have a green-thumb but AeroGarden makes me a competent gardener. I check it 2-3 times a day, not because I need to (it runs automatically) but out of sheer pleasure. I highly recommend this product and in fact I will buy a second one and start growing tomatoes next. It is such great value for money, I estimate that it will pay for itself within 90-120 days compared with purchasing fresh herbs in the supermarket."
2,Not Completely Happy,"Three of the seven herbs are not growing and the selection of plants isn't very good, think they should offer single plants."
5,"High Quality, and Attractive Too.","I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, so this is just an initial review. It will be updated later.First of all, AeroGrow packages there product very well. It is very well contain and also nice to look at.We upboxed it and followed the directions to set up the product. The directions were very good and easy to follow. They made it very simple and took away any potential confusion.When we plugged it in and let it do it's thing, it sounds like a high quality device. It does not make any irritating noises, and in fact sounds a bit like a quiet fish tank.The light is very bright, and very clean and crisp. This is wonderful.We got the white one, which is bright and refreshing. I think silver and black would be good colors as well, but black was a little too dark for my tastes. The white is just very appropriate. I was afraid at first that it would look a bit like some giant ipod, but it does not.So far this product is a 5 star item."
5,AeroGrow - Plant and stand back,"We saw a friend's AeroGrow and collected a handful of basil. Looked like fun, so we got one. WOW. Everything came up. The plants sat there for a couple of weeks then took off. The chives reached the light and it browned the tips. We raised the lights one notch, then another, then another. Now a month out, the light is in the highest notch. Everything is growing well, although the parsley is slower than the rest. The growing is fun, but having a sprig of fresh cilantro in homemade salsa is even better! Instruction sheet is clearly written and easy to follow. I rate this product as 5 star fun. Christmas breakfast will include scrambled eggs with fresh chives. We bought a second one to give as a gift."
4,AeroGrow AeroGarden,I have really enjoyed this product. My plants are growing like crazy! I love the way the fresh herbs look and smell. My 9 year old son thinks it the coolest thing to watch everything grow with out dirt. I'm very pleased! Thank you!
1,Makes a lousy gift,"I purchased this for my dad as a Father's Day gift because he likes to cook and he's always had a green thumb. Unfortunately, it's been over two months since he had it and nothing ever grew. He followed all of the directions to no avail. I contacted AeroGrow but they didn't seem to care and were zero help. I do not recommend this to anyone, unless you're one of those people that enjoys throwing your money down the drain? Instead, if you want herbs for the kitchen, I recommend buying dry herbs. And, if you want to grow herbs (or vegetables) then I recommend doing it the old fashioned way."
3,Not what I expected,The refills for this item are a little pricey. The initial layout has numerous of the same type herb. I was expecting more variety in the sample pack.
5,Very Impressed,I recently picked up the Aerogarden for my wife since she loves fresh herbs. The only Herb she didn't like in the package was Dill. So we replaced the Dill with Oregano and let me say it worked like a charm. We simply removed the Dill seed from the sponge and put in our Oregano seed. Normal germination for Oregano is 10 to 20 days. We had growth after only 3 days using the Aerogarden. Big Success - Love the Machine.Take Care..
1,aerogrow shipping is the worst!,"I ordered an Elite Aerogrow Garden on April 1, 2010. My credit card was immediately charged and here it is April 28th and still no Aerogrow! I have repeatedly called customer service and while the people are quite attentive I have yet to receive a shipping confirmation - no Aerogrow. I am told my product is sitting on a pallet in their shipping warehouse. My, my...An Extremely disappointed ex-customer"
1,Great if ....you want to grow bugs!!,This product is an awful waste of money!!! It started to sprout within a few days as advertised and that is it. After that the only thing that grew out of this total waste of money were small bugs. The small sprouts died off and the bugs took over. What a shame because this seemed like the perfect solution to my apartment blues. Needless to I threw it in the trash after trying everything but CPR to get one little plant.
1,Very difficult company-bad customer service,very bad customer service.my mother who is 86 years old bought one for her grandson who happens to be in the Army. She entered the wrong address on the order. She called aerogarden immeidately and Aerogarden customer service told her to order a second one and to fix the address problem on the second order. Aerogarden could have EASILY rerouted the order to the correct address--she called within 10 minutes of placing the order. They forced her to order a second one and then they made her pay for the freight to return it to them. poor customer service all around. very unhelpful.
3,Difficult to use when you live in the Southwest,It is an great concept but only 3 out of my 7 pods came up and aerogrow customer service was out of a lot of spices when I called to get them replaced. It is recommended that you only use distilled water if you live in the southwest which makes it more expensive to grow.
3,Did not grow,We purchased this in August 2010 but didn't start it till 12-05-10. Three of the pods never sprouted and the ones that did were stunted and had yellow leaves. I contacted AeroGarden and they explained that they had changed from tablet nutrient to liquid and would ship a whole new kit with nutrients. Hooray for AeroGarden but not the shipper I used at Amazon: HorticultureSource.com
1,disappointed,"I purchased the 7-pod AeroGarden approx. five weeks ago. I immediately set it up which was very simple to do. I inserted the pods and added the water and nutrients tablets as instructed. I saw sprouts take place within a week as expected. I check everything daily anticipating growth....well this is where we are very disappointed. After five weeks the plants grew to heights of only 1 1/2 inches at best. They seem dormant, stopped growing weeks ago, and basically just quit on me. I followed the instructions and can't understand why they quit growing other than maybe the seeds were of poor quality. We have city water which we use on all of our house plants which flurish. So.. needless to say that we are very disappointed. I will go on line and purchase seven more seed pods and hopefully things will turn out differently. By the way...I do have a green thumb, you should see my garden outside every year...wow !"
4,Aerogarden system,"I bought the unit from Amazon and It came with the herbs. The herbs grew very well and fast and will last a long time. Easy to read and follow instructions. I did purchase the Strawberry plants for this directly from Aerogarden in Colorado in early spreing . The plants arrived and the root system was a little bit black, even though it was sent with a heated unit for the plants. Several weeks later I received an email stating that they made an error with the nutrients tablets and that you should use only 1 at a time . Th strawberry plants did not do well until I transplanted them into my outdoor strawberry bed, now they ar fine. Buy the unit though and get the herb garden its really worth it."
3,My experience,I have had the aerogarden for three months. Maybe I am doing something wrong but the yield does not justify the cost. The seeds cost about $20. Running 100 watts for about 18 hours a day is expensive. You can do much better buying organic food at Whole Foods.It is a good conversation piece.
2,Nothing like those commercials,"I have had my Aerogarden for about nine months. I am definitely not impressed. I planted my first set of gourmet herbs which came with the garden, and all I ever got to harvest and use was tons of basil, more than I could ever use, and a little cilantro. The dill, mint, chives, and parsley never grew big enough to use. And I was really looking forward to picking fresh sprigs of mint anytime I wanted to make a mojito. I have been waiting months for that mojito. My results never looked anything like the big bushes of herbs they show on the infomercials. I planted my second round of herbs about 6 weeks ago. This time, most of my herbs did not even germinate. And my pump rattles ridiculously loud. I e-mailed the company and they are more than helpful and are sending out a new seed kit and a new pump. I am not looking forward to installing that pump after reading others experiences. For the money, it is not worth the very small amount of useable herbs."
3,"Great product, Horrible customer service.","I received the garden and followed the directions exactly as written. Everything was sprouting wonderfully except the cilantro. There are germination days listed on each pod and the cilantro states 14 days. Everything else in the garden was growing great! I wrote 3 emails to aerogarden and after a week no response. I've called them three times and been on hold over 15 minutes each never getting a customer service representative. I have left a voicemail on their vm service, still ZERO response. Once you buy the product you are ON YOUR OWN! Good Luck!"
2,AeroGrow,"Little over priced for what it is. The lights are way too bright, so if you do not have a room to put it in, you will get a headache from the light. Where they show it sitting in a kitchen, I believe it to be very impractical.I haven't had mine long enough yet to get any product from it, but the plants are growing nicely."
2,Blanks,"After 3 weeks, all that is growing is the two Basils and dill - no sign of anything coming upin the other three pods."
2,"More work, but it works","It took 2 kits to get a full garden. Only 2 seeds grew on the first kit. I wrote to aerogarden and they sent me a replacement, told me to use distilled water (the kit said not to use distilled water, to use tap water). I received the replacement kit quickly and was able to get some more growth from new seeds, but took a few more times. There are 7 spots, 2 grew with first kit, 3 more grew with second kit, and 2 more are still waiting on. I like this product, but should be as easy as they said. I really like the customer service that went with the product though."
2,Wait until price drops,"This thing is huge. At full height it won't fit on the counter under the kitchen cabinets. So definitely think about where you'll put this before you buy it. Also, the output wasn't what I expected. I've grown the herb kit and the tomato kit. It's easier to grow tomatoes outside than in this thing. I got a lot of dill from the herb kit, not much else. I don't even use dill that much. I'll definitely stick with an outdoor garden next year."
3,Buggy Garden!,"I got this garden for Christmas. My first round of mixed herbs went pretty well. However, you need to follow the directions for harvesting. Some of my plants did not look so good after awhile. Also, something was eating my basil. Everyday I would find little bite marks on it. I did get some nice herbs and enjoyed cooking with them at the beginning. My garden never really looked like the picture. I think I harvested a little early and took to much off at first. I decided to try again.My next herb kit is in there right now. Not doing so well. Little nats or white flys are everywhere. They must have come with the plants. There are a ton of them everywhere. I tried to spray them with an herbal spray but it killed the nats and and injured the plants. I rinced them all off but they are stuggling. I'm going to have to start over again!"
2,Poor quality,It sounded neat but it has some major drawbacks. Only 2 weeks after purchasing it the water level low light came on and won't turn off. Only half of the pods appear to be sprouting - the others died (for a $20 seed kit I expect all to live). The lights are very bright and the motor can be distracting but isn't too bad. Every 6 months you need to replace the bulbs.
3,"Fun novelty, kind of works, way overpriced","I got this as a gift, which tempers my review -- had I paid nearly $150 for it, I'd feel pretty ripped off. But, it does grow some nice basil. I'd prefer some oregano or tarragon in the herb kit in place of the second type of basil though, just for more variety. And cilantro seems an odd choice, it's not as versatile or universally loved as some herbs, but mine never sprouted at all anyway. The parsley never made it past 2"". I'm excited to start my second kit, the tomato one, as tomato season winds down, but I'm not as optimistic as I was now that I've read about all these pump problems. If your place doesn't get much direct sun, it's a fun experiment (and my cat has enjoyed eating the chives...) but if you've got a sunny windowsill, save your money and grow them the old-fashioned way."
4,Grow your own stuff,"The AeroGarden is a great idea and will definitely be appreciated by gadget-lovers, home cooks, and those not blessed with a green thumb (but especially folks who are all of the above, like me :)) The system works surprisingly well and is very easy to use. The effect: fresh herbs at an arm's reach without dirt or fuss or mess plus a nice kitchen decoration as a bonus. The only flaw is the noise of the pump which can get pretty loud and annoying at times."
3,Too soon to tell,"Even though I bought this (as a Christmas gift to myself) about a month ago, it has only been planted for one week now so it is a bit early to tell how successful it will be. (Hence only a three-star rating) The one thing I noticed right away is how brilliant the grow light is - so much so that I am having to drape dish towels over it when the lights are on otherwise it is blinding. I have a small house and even with the dish towels covering it, I have to close my bedroom door at night because it would otherwise be too light in my bedroom to sleep.Four of the pods have already sprouted, the other three will likely poke their heads out in another day or two. I have my fingers crossed that I will garner a good herb harvest for winter cooking. I will update once I have had some experience to share."
2,Big and VERY Bright,"Mine just arrived a couple of days ago, so plants haven't grown yet. However, just wanted to share how important it is to have the right place for the thing. The lights are VERY bright, and you'd need to have a huge kitchen counter to place it on. It is bigger than I expected, and kind of intrusive. If I had seen it in person, I would not have bought it. Measure your space carefully before buying, and consider having very bright light almost all the time!"
5,great product,"i love watching the plants sprout and grow--it's extremely exciting. a bit expensive, but worth it to me because I live on a military-like compound and do not have access to markets to buy herbs."
2,"Disappointing Read: If you are looking for details of the Panic of 1873 or The Sioux, this is not for you","I was expecting the title to be followed closely. This was not the case. It is a very detailed and exhaustively researched book on the Northern Pacific railroad, its construction and the cast of characters (Gen. Custer included) who were associated with it. It gives only very brief coverage of the Panic of 1873 (this is not a similar book as the ""Panic of 1907"", covering a similar event of another time). The Sioux get bit more coverage but only as they relate to the Railroad construction. A bit more detail about them in a general sense would have been useful. If you are looking for railroad history in the US, with some colorful charachters like Custer, this is your book. If you are looking for a book with an economic and markets bent, as it relates to the 1873 Panic and its aftermath or the history of the Sioux, you may be disappointed."
4,substantial but not overwhelming,"I don't really agree with either of the other reviews -- I find this to be a good introduction to linguistic anthropology, not too high level (certainly not as dense as similar books by Duranti or others). It's short enough that I can use it in a survey course and still have room for some articles and perhaps an ethnography. It covers all the major areas without going into so much detail than non-majors will get lost or fed up. It may be ""cheap"" inasmuch as there are no color photos, but I appreciate that such measures keep the price down. However, the lack of an index and a glossary are indeed significant drawbacks.I was assigned the first edition of this book when I was a student. Now that I'm a professor, I keep looking around, but haven't found another that fits my needs quite as well as this one does, despite its shortcomings."
5,aawesome,Its crazy hatchtoric funny and awesome everyone with clown love has to see it my kidlos even loved ot mcl los
3,Not At All Original,"This CD has one major flaw, that is if you are a real fan of the Dramatics. The flaw is with track # 16. This track is not orinigal. This is one of several post original versions of ""Toast To The Fool"". Sound quality is very good, and the selection is good until one gets to track #16, then one has this very big let down. The version everyone is most familiar with, is the version which only appeared on the 45, and the cassete version, of this very CD.I hope this information will be passed on to Stax Records, and corrected, in future productions.Maybe in future productions the 45 version can be included as well."
5,Must Have,"This CD is sort of a starter kit for fans of the Dramatics that do not have larger compilations. What is important to note is that this CD contains the SECOND version of ""Toast to the Fool"", the one with LJ and Lenny. This version was never played on the radio when the song was actually out. It's an OK version, but doesnt come close to comparing with WeeGee Howard and Elbert Wilkin's version, which is the authentic ""hit"" version. Most Dramatic's fans dont know this, and this is the only version they have heard since the real ""Toast"" was never on an album (only came out on a 45)."
1,the worst,"i have been collecting gay related films for years and have watched some bad movies from beginning to end. but this was a truly painful experience, the worst gay movie i have ever watched"
2,"Not Inspired, Not memorable","Gonzalo is a fantastic pianist. This CD however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side. However, it is languid and the tunes don't stand out. It is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if driving later in the day. I have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste. But it is exciting. Not here. There is barely a hint of any Cuban influence in this music as well. Now some will like the gentleness I suppose, but with weak material and not much diversity, it sits pretty flat with me."
2,Inside itself,"2 1/2With few exceptions, this slow paced night jazz is too meanderingly mellow, while fiery flights of latin-tinged fancy can feel familiar as well."
4,Hilarious almost from Start to Finish,"I picked this book up randomly, just because the premise sounded interesting, but I ended up reading the whole thing in one day. Just the fact that the book revolves around a rag-tag superteam composed of people with some people with almost useless powers (or none at all) is funny enough, but then they get into some ridiculous situations that made me literally laugh out loud. Unfortunately, then they start to deal with some more serious topics and issues that kind of hurt the initial feel of the book. It is certainly a memorable book though, so much that I even went out and got the second one later on."
2,disappointment,"I bought this after hearing ""Summer in Siam"" off the ""Basquiat"" soundtrack. I love that song, but nothing else on this CD came anywhere near it. A lot of the songs sound like they are sung by an Irish Bruce Springsteen--ugh! I am glad I bought this puppy used. Now I am wondering if I should try a different album of theirs or just forget it."
2,The Cracks Were Showing,"Slagging the Pogues isn't something I like to do, but if you're going to be true to the bands you like, that means they have to take the criticism as well as the accolades. And the fact is, this album misses the mark by far.By any other band it might even be a 3- or 4-star affair, but not by the Pogues. Spider Stacy claimed that 'it's not timid... it's raucous when it has to be.' but this is hogwash. The songwriting is uninteresting, the conviction of the band (especially shane's vocals) is found wanting, and the album never really gels as a 'Pogues' release.Matt Johnson's subsequent TheThe releases following 'Infected' are similar, in that they're a total departure, and they might be saluted as an artistic (read: maturity) change, but they're less interesting as a result.If you find it used--cheap--you might want to pick it up, but otherwise forget about it. I'm sure the Pogues already have."
4,Pocket guide,"Handy pocket size book, 75 page guide on basic manners and behaviour.Gift idea for first-time visitors to Thailand."
3,Artifact game,"This was purchased with an 11-yr old in mind. I, as the parent, had a difficult time understanding the instructions and the game itself was extremely time-consuming. The child will probably grow into it, however, he did loose interest after 45 minutes of playing time with little advancement on the playing board."
3,"Hard to find battery, FSB96","Works fine, but this is one hard battery to find. B&D says ""they're in all the hardware stores,"" but I've yet to find one anywhere but online (just one). They must have built this drill as a loss leader, since the batteries are nearly extinct."
5,Reference NKJV to this for plain english,I love the NKJV but have been using The Promise along with it! Also bought an extra copy to give to my son to tempt him to read the Bible through.
5,Excellent Translation,"This Bible is so easy to read and understand and written with great ""intent"" so you really get the underlying message God wants you to understand. I have recommended this book in my forthcoming book, God of Miracles (Publishing date: 3/99). I have purchased many of these books and given to friends and unbelievers so they can read the Bible, and they certainly do so with ""The Promise."" I strongly recommend this book for all those who really wish to ""understand"" the Word of God and have fun doing so! James Russell/author"
5,Nice meat pounder,"I got this because I was looking for something better than the little meat hammer I've used since I was a boy. I had made some chicken piccata and had pretty much shredded the meat with the hammer - mostly, I think, because of its small surface area. This has a nice big surface - I used it on some more chicken piccata and it worked fine. I also like its ability to tenderize meat (you unscrew the handle and screw it in on the other side so the prongs stick out. I haven't tried this, but it looks like it'll do the job. You have better control over the hammer action, I think, because you grasp the tool and your arm becomes the hammer handle, so to speak. There's a plastic piece that goes between the handle and the hammer surface. I think it keeps the handle tight. Looks like it'd be easy to lose when cleaning."
1,Please...,"I'm sorry but I saw her live and I found her obnoxious, insulting, and ridiculous. I know blues music, real blues music and this is not it. Try the legendary Ella Fitzgerald, a woman she was so quick to insult at the concert I attended. Ella was blues- this woman is not."
4,Extremely enjoyable and historical interesting,"I really enjoyed this novel. It has history, romance, faith, adventure, all centered around the issue of slavery. The characters are interesting and alive, and in Hannah, we find someone we can relate to. Because of past tragedies, she struggles with her faith in God and when confronted with the issue of slavery, she doesn't want to get involved. Yet, inevitably, she comes head to head with it, as two handsome men battle for her affections, one who owns slaves and the other who helps them escape. I guarantee you will enjoy every minute of this charming story!"
2,Haven't I read this before?,"Seems to me that another book I read by this author had many of the same themes. She writes well enough, and there are some moments in this book that I found disturbing, particularly as some of my own family members were victims of the Nazi occupation in Ukraine. They and many other survivors of the Third Reich (and of the Soviets, who were worse)have accurately reported on how many millions of Ukrainians were enslaved or murdered by both regimes. Anyway, I put this book down feeling as if this author has written much of this before. Just can't remember where. So I don't rate it as highly as some other books I have read about the Holocaust. In terms of personal memoirs I recommend Stefan Petelycky's Into Auschwitz, For Ukraine. It's the true story of a Holocaust survivor, Auschwitz #154922, and a Ukrainian patriot. Quite au contraire to the usual prejudiced stereotypes about Ukrainians as collaborators."

4,1.5 gal,one of the reviews stated that they got fast shipping. i live in utah and it took over 2 weeks to get to me. i ordered it for a camping trip and when i got home from the trip this tank was waiting for me on my front porch(too late). the handle is great and any heater/grill will work just fine. i got the atachment hose from home-depo $20. so i have not used it yet. i got it filled up for about $4. i got 1.1 gal of propan in it. i guess it will eventualy pay for it self.
5,The Best New Age Pianist,I originally heard Aaberg on a Windham Hill collection. His sole cut on that album was O Shenandoah. There was so much feeling and originality in that take that I had to pursue his other works. Via the Amazon website I selected this album. It is as fantastic as all of these reviewers indicate. The piano is an extension of this performer.
4,Straight out of american minds,"This anthology was written straight out of american minds. Minds that are everyday heros in poetry's battle to stay mainstream. The poems and feelings reflected here are quality works although written by amature poets. You don't need a literary degree to write good poetry and certainly not to enjoy this excellent work by Lovestories.com poets. They have set a new standard in the way American poets and storytellers can come together through the internet and make their voices heard. Congrats to all the poets and the founder/editor, Alanna Webb."
5,Bytes offers many Bites,A surprisingly wide breadth of poetry in this Anthology. This translates to some poem Bytes not suited to a particular pallet but everyone will find several servings of words that are cause for salivation. Taste it as a snack as opposed to a sitdown dinner and make it last. Byte into it.
1,Misleading description,"I agree with the last reviewer, the description for this item makes it sound like it is a featherbed, not simply as a cover. Admittedly, its name is ""featherbed cover,"" but the description says that it has goose down fill --- which this cover certainly does not!"
1,I was robbed,It is a sheet with a zipper. No feathers any where. Completely mis leading. But aint worth the $10 hassle to return.
1,233-Thread-Count King Featherbed Cover (Zippered),"Because,Your title not clear; your post ""233-thread-count king featherbed cover(zippered)"". I confused it was full size not king size. So I purchased for king comforter not fit for them; but marterial not bad. Can you change to me king size . Thanks alot...."
5,Great Cover!,"I think this cover is just perfect for the price and easy zipper closure! The other reviewers must not have read the description closely because it does say COVER! A featherbed is a featherbed, this says featherbed cover! Easy to take off, easy to wash, and easy to put back on!"
4,Better than you may think,"The teeth of the zipper could be a bit stronger as it often comes undone but I just run the zipper over that spot again and it stays shut. The cotton is very soft. I wish it was more of a box design so it could fit the 5"" height of my featherbed to allow for maximum loft. Otherwise, for the price, this thing rocks!"
3,It's a COVER. It looks NOTHING like the picture. It's NOT padded.,"I read the item name, description, reviews and looked at the picture.This picture is decieving.I've purchased 3 bed toppers from Amazon that were ~ $12-$14 - ""Pillow Top Queen Fiberbed"" for regular mattresses that are 3"" thick hypoallergenic polyester fiber filled that look in their picture a lot like this cover...a stuffed ""something.""If you're looking for a padded or filled cover you don't want this.If you're looking for a single layer protective cover - like a 233 thread count flat fitted sheet for your feather bed, this is what you want. Beware of the pictures."
5,great resource,I was looking for this book. It's a great book for me!!I'm very happy to have it in my library.
2,Not worth it,"This is not a ""fat burning"" yoga session. If you want a strenuous, Ashtanga workout, try Bryan Kest. If you want a contemplative, relaxing session, try Crunch ""Candlelight Yoga"". Skip this one. I actually became bored and angry watching this dud."
2,no sweat,"I have been practicing yoga for about two months and thought this tape would offer me a portable workout. I am not at all advanced, but this tape still offered no challenge or burn for me. I suppose it is ok for those just starting, or perhaps those with a low starting fitness level, but if you exercise regularly, this is not the tape for you. On the plus side, the poses were explained well, by an instructor who seemed to know her stuff."
2,merely okay,"I would not call myself an advanced practitioner of yoga but I have been practising for a few years.I was really hoping that this tape would be a more rigorous workout than it was.Although the instructor was very clear and easy to follow, i really wished that there were more sequences and that the class would move a little bit faster.I would recommend this tape more for yoga novices and not for intermediate practitioners who are looking for a more challenging workout."
4,Very good for beginners like me,"This video was what I used for the first time I ever attempted yoga and, after being slightly discouraged at my lack of skill during the first few times, I have now advanced to a stage where I actually look forward to doing yoga, thanks to this cassette. It's a great toner, especially for arms (usually a difficult area to trim down for me) and abdomen. And I very definitely find myself working up a serious sweat. Sara Ivanhoe's (cool name, I must admit) extra-calm demeanor can be somewhat annoying at first but you get used to it and afterwards even learn to appreciate it. The cool-down period could have been a little more extended. After mastering this cassette, one can probably move on to a more advance workout."
2,Good only for a slow day,"I found this yoga workout to be great for stretching out the muscles and is a great option for a day I'm not really into working out. But, I definitely do not think it's ""fat burning"" as touted. It did work some muscles I didn't know I had, but I think that there are much better options in Karen Voight's collection."
4,crunch - fat burning yoga,"I bought this thinking it was for beginners like it said, but if you never did yoga before and are not that flexible its not for you. Just couldn't do have the stuff on the tape."
4,Great Video to Start With!,"This was the first yoga tape I've ever bought. I've gone to the gym and taken yoga before and really liked it, but I wanted to find a challenging enough workout to do at home. This tape was it! It's great for the beginner to intermediate and the instructor is a nice-girl-next door personality. I found the workout to be challenging, and just when the thought ""is this ever going to be over?"" crosses your mind, it is just that-over! I think it's a great workout in the 45 mins it takes. I hope they come out with another tape soon."
2,Tough stuff!,"I'm no yoga beginner, I've been doing it for a few years, and Crunch's first yoga tape (The Joy of Yoga) is still one of my favorites, I love the style and the instructor (who also does this video too). This tape is only recommended for those who are advanced in their yoga practice or just naturally very flexible. I did make it through the whole tape, but I was miserable for the next two days, my back and hips were killing me. This is probably a good tape for the advanced, but if you're a beginner, leave this one alone, there are better ones to start with that will help you to stick with yoga."
4,Challenging yet fun,"I found this yoga tape to be very instructive and the breathing reminders helpful. As a yoga beginner the little ""tips"" on how to maximize each pose were great. Much of this information will be helpful to keep in mind while completing other yoga videotapes. The setting and the music were calming, yet still had energy. I would recommend this to those who are just learning yoga and to those who want to challenge themselves more."
2,Get the MTV Yoga Video Instead,"I was really looking forward to using this video, but once I got it I was disappointed. The video doesn't offer much of a workout, and I found the host to be annoying. At the end of the video viewers are taken through a series of sit-ups, which are good for the abs, but not at all yogic.For anyone looking for a good yoga video, I would recommend the MTV Yoga tape. The host is great and it moves at a faster pace, offering a better workout in my opinion."
4,Good Workout,"I really like this video! I think those of us who did all of those aerobic classes in the 80s and 90s have struggled to believe that there are low/non-impact ways to burn fat and tone/sculpt one's body. Practicing yoga does in fact do both of these and all you have to do is try it and you'll like it. This video is a good length and because Sarah, the instructor, takes you through the moves in a ""yoga flow"" your heart rate will go up and you'll be building muscles at the same time. If you want to balance out those spinning and kick boxing classes like I did, this video works and gives you results! Also if you are a true beginner, who has never taken any yoga classes, this tape may be too much to start with. For beginners, get the Crunch Joy of Yoga or one of the Living Arts beginner videos to familiarize yourself w/the poses and the style of yoga. For those who do know yoga, this tape allows you to use your knowledge and get a good workout."
1,This yoga tape is a waste of time and money,"I own nearly 20 yoga tapes--and use them, nearly every day. This is my second Crunch yoga video and both of them are terrible, but this one is particularly bad. I am not one of those ""deep"" yogis--I do it for exercise, mainly, and not really for the breathing and meditation aspects--but this is the most un-yoga-like video imaginable. It treats yoga like an aerobics class. That aside, the workout itself is very lame and has no flow to it, the sequence of poses is awkward, and by the time a vinyasa has finally been pieced together, the tape has ended. The only fat this tape could possibly burn is from your wallet."
2,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this yoga tape. I had never taken a yoga class before and was surprised by how easy the tape was for me to do. This tape might be good for someone that's not in good shape what-so-ever but if you're in any kind of shape at all, this tape is not for you. It was kind of disappointing even for a beginner yoga enthusiast like myself."
5,Good toning workout,"This workout is execllent for toning. If a person is trying to lose weight, I would recommend to combine it with aerobics and weight training exercises. One important thing to keep in mind is that this dvd is not for beginners or people who are new to yoga. Sarah Ivanhoe is one of my favorite instructer, and her cueing is perfect. After sometime you don't need to look at the tv screen.."
3,Good for Quick Workout,"This is a good, quick workout if you're new to yoga or if you're not looking for a full yogic workout. This is more of an intro to vinyasa or for someone wanting a cardio workout without a lot of holding or flexibility practice. My heart rate was definitely up and I broke a bit of a sweat, but I'm spoiled by a typical 90 minute class with lots of poses and challenges. This a good ""teaser"" when you don't have time for a full 90 minute session."
4,A good way to revive your routine...,"I've been exercising on and off for a few years. When I started again a few months back, I wanted minimal impact exercise with a lot of stretching for flexibility as well as a flow series that would get me sweating. Crunch's Fat Burning Yoga did the job! It doesn't make you sweat as much and the poses are for those who are more or less knowledgeable about yoga basics but you can easily follow Sarah's instructions and if you practice in front of a mirror, you'll manage to adjust your posture correctly. It's a good everyday workout for those days when you're neither too lazy nor too energetic. I do this 3x a week. Nice!"
2,Good only for a slow day,"I found this yoga workout to be great option for a day I'm not motivated for a tough workout. But, I definitely do not think it's ""fat burning"" as touted. It did work some muscles I didn't know I had, but I think that there are much better options in Karen Voight's collection."
4,"What's certain?: One boy dead, and many commentaries","Other reviewers cover the ground well; but let me fill in a blank or two. I am white, and I have several Hispanic and black friends. I believe each of us looks, ... or rather, would look, ... at the death of this boy from different perspectives that result directly from the color of skin we have. This forces upon us an inherent lapse in reason when deciding how justice may be found. Our ability to reason is something we must constantly refresh, or we are the less human. I suppose, contrary to feelings and what the eye tells us, my being ""white,"" and the color of someone else's skin, same or different, becomes irrelevant while we have command of our reasoning abilities. So, do we have that command?"
2,"Disjointed, unstable focus","Kotlowitz's first book was stunning and I think he should have stuck with that type of writing. This book is a disappointing second. The entire story is rambling and often has no discernible point. I'm sure this is much more meaningful for residents of the town. The racial thing has been slanted so many ways in the media by now, I still think that 'The Eye of the Storm' from 1968 takes the cake."
3,My Thoughts on the Subject...,"Alex Kotlowitz's ""The Other Side of the River"" is a disturbing account of how people live in this country today. At times it is hard to believe that this story actually takes place in America. This book is relatively easy to read, which is a plus. The multitude of facts, opinions, theories, speculations and rumors makes this book hard to put down. Each chapter raises more questions, and answers fewer. This book also does a good job presenting a story from two very different perspectives. Both perspectives have their supporting elements and their holes. In the end the reader chooses which side of the story to believe, and utlimately which side of the river they more readily identify with. Overall, this book is worth taking the time to read."
4,A thought provking look into the tragedy of a young man.,I think this book allows for an accurate look into an unfortunate and often true racial tensions that have long been ignored in this country. Kotlowitz has done his homework and presents a story in a hartfelt maner that will remain with the reader for a very long time to follow. I personally was asigned this book as required reading for a class on state and local government and would highly recomend that it becomes a part of high school required reading. The book makes you realy think about your own racial stereotypes and briefly allows you to see the same issue from a different perspective. I think we all feel the same seperation that these two towns have experienced at some point in our lives. Maybee we are all more similar to one anther than we think.
3,"Good book, but I've read better","This book is well written and explores the racial and socioeconomic difference our society holds. I however find that it is similar in plot and theme to his previous book, There are no Children Here. I still recommend that this book be read in conjunction with the other, but not by itself."
3,Private Troubles?,"This book was indeed an intrigue. It was rather easy to read and actually a good supplemental reading for a sociology class. Though slightly biased as he was, Kotlowitz uses the individual example of Eric McGinnis's death to illustrate the unrest and snowball effect that race has on society. The social problems that are results of ""killings"" (presumed race killings) are of a high magnitude. Although I live in the state where these events occurred (and therefore have my own biases) I believe this to be an accurate portrayal of social unrest due to race relations."
2,Eh,"Was assigned for a Social Studies class. Prof was highly enthused, no one else in the class was. Fortunately I was able to still get my A without finishing this one."
2,Not as good as I expected...,"Alex's last book There Are No Children Here is hard to top, but I tried to give The Other Side of the River a chance. What was the point of the book? To show the different levels of racial tensions within this particular community or to find out who killed the teenager? I am still trying to understand the purpose of the book. I felt like I didn't learn anything new."
1,Beware of offensive language,"The story of two towns in Michigan - St. Joseph and Benton Harbor - geographically close but racially worlds apart. St. Joseph is 95% white, Benton Harbor is 92% black. St. Joseph is prosperous, Benton Harbor impoverished. When the body of a black, teenage boy from Benton Harbor is found in the river, suspicions between the towns surface. The author reports results of his investigation into the case and reveals racial attitudes in the process.For mature readers only because of offensive language and discussions of gangs and the Ku Klux Klan."
3,Informative. Author understands people.,"I read this book because I lived in Michigan 25 years and never knew about the friction between St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. I found the facts about Benton Harbor's police cars being repoed and how the repair of colapsed main street was handled to say alot about the living conditions in Benton Harbor. It is shocking how the fathers of a city can really mess things up. As far as the death investigation, this is a throughly researched book and by the end you understand why the case has not been solved. The author has a way with describing the embarrassing characteristics of people. The investigation was doomed the moment the body was found. Did anyone else notice that the body was hosed down before the police even arrived. Alot of people are clearly stupid in this country and this book does a great job at shedding light on how their actions can effect an entire community."
4,okay but flawed,"well-written and easy to read, but degenerates into just a series of anecdotes. Why? The author has no moral compass and not only admits it, but celebrates it as a liberal virtue. ""Truth depends on what race you are"" he expressly says. This is not only an infinitely sad statement, but also explains why this book has no center and is all frosting and no cake. Enjoy it skeptically."
5,A must read,"I actually lived in St. Joseph when this happened and I do remember all the racial tension. As a child and teenager I was always told never to cross the bridge over to Benton Harbor because of how dangerous it was over there. I moved from St. Joes in 1995 and I did not know about this book until a couple years ago. When I first started reading it, it brought back a lot of memorys. This really is a great book and it does capture the tension between the two towns perfectly. I would really recommend this book."
4,Well written and compelling,I had to read this book and honestly was not too excited about it but after beginning I could not put it down. I was also fortunate enough to hear the author speak about how he became interested in the story. I would recomend this to anyone.
4,predictable but a good read,I have loved every book from Catherine Anderson. This book was no different. She has always brought such deep emotional love to her characters. Good Read!
5,Didn't want this book to end.......,"I loved this book.. but then I love most all of Catherine Anderson's books. I got so into this book I couldn't put it down. It's a book that you don't want to end. You don't think of ""abuse"" happening back in those days, but it was probably more common then we would think. It's just talked about more today. I really felt for this woman & her child. It's really a great story, has it all.... tears, warmth & a few laughs. Keep it up Catherine Anderson..."
3,Coming Up Roses,"This book wasn't in good condition. I was really disappointed with it, but wanted it so bad that I'll keep it until I can find another one. For the price, it wasn't worth it. I love to order through Amazon and this is the first disappointment I've had."
1,Terrible dark book,This book was awful. I can't believe anybody liked it. I will never buy another book by this author. It was really an awful book.
4,Enjoyable read,I enjoy Catherine Anderson's books and this one didn't disappoint. The fear that the heroine had of her brother-in-law was a little over the top but then back then a female wasn't always listened to. The end of the trial was a little unbelievable and wrapped up a little to pat but overall the book was still enjoyable.
4,Mick Harte Was Here,"Have you ever enjoyed riding your bike and not bothering to wear a helmet? Well, in this book you will find it is very important.Mick is a young boy in the 7th grade who thought he would never fall of his bike. One morning he rode his bike to school. When his friends mom decided she would pick them up from school for work they were working on together, Mick had to find a way to get his bike home.While at lunch he kindally asked his sister to ride his bike home but she had soccer practice. This left Mick to ride his bike home and then go to his friends house.Mick was riding home when suddenly he fell over a rock and into the path of a car. He had serious head injuries since he wasn't wearing his helmet. His death was tragic.This book is very good. You will see how his mom, dad, and sister try to move on! I highly reccommend this book."
2,Mick Harte Was Here,"Phoebe Harte, one of the characters in Mick Harte Was Here, is going through some tough times when her brother gets hit in the back of the head by a truck after tumbling over a rock. Phoebe will never forgive herself for that day. When a teacher asked Phoebe if she could tell a little bit about bike accidents, she is still in pain, so decides not to, but later she changes her mind and does. Take it from a kid who knows a good book when he sees it: this was just plan boring. However, if you had a sibling who just died, I would recommend this book."
2,Eric's Review,I did not like the book Mick Harte Was Here. I have never liked sad stories. There were a few parts I liked. One part was when Phoebe and Mick were fighting over a tattoo. There was one more part. It was when Mick got run over. Those are the only parts I liked. The books I like are action and adventure. Books like that are exciing. That's why I did not like this book.
2,MICK HARTE WAS HERE,MICK HARTE WAS HERE is an emotional book. The book talks about death.This book has the characters crying. That book has the mother taking sleeping pills.That is why MICK HARTE WAS HERE was so emotional.
4,Mick Harte Was Here,"I'm surprised this book hasn't won a Newberry Award! It was not only sad, touching, and even funny, but it had a very good message. Despite a few swear words, I found nothing bad or innappropraite about this book, except that some may be disturbed by it. After reading this book, you'll never want to ride your bike without a helmet again."
4,Death and Dealing,"I used to read this book monthly when I was younger. It really helped me grasp the concept of mortality in a nonintrusive manner. I recommend this book to mostly the youth, since it is a children's book, but I say let them read it before someone dear to them passes. It was a very important book to me and I feel it can be just as important to those who let it be."
5,Omigod! This was sooooo sad!,"Omigod! This was sooooo sad! I almost cried! The way Mick was..... How could someone like Phoebe's brother die? Mick Harte was one of the neatest kids you'd ever want to meet---the kid who freaked out his mom by putting a ceramic eye in a defrosted chicken; who went trick-or-treating as Thomas Crapper,the inventor of the modern-day flush toilet; who did a wild solo dance in front of the whole school.Mick was also the kid who would still be alive now---if only he'd worn his bicycle helmet... See?!?!? Now isn't that sad? I can't tell you anymore,you'd have to read it for yourself.Check it out at a local library near you!"
4,CJ's Review,"Mick Harte Was Here is a book about a girl. Her name is Phoebe and she is telling her story about how she gets over her brother's death ,and how she thinks it's her fault.Overall it's an excellent book. There are a lot of heart jerking moments where I had to keep reading, and at some points, it gets hysterically funny. Then at other times, it's a snooze. However, I think if you read this book, you will have fun with it. I really recommend it."
5,Everyone Should Read This Book,"My son brought this book home from school and asked me to read it. He told me his teacher had read it to his class and it was important to him. So a few days later I took some time to read it ,partly because I knew he would keep asking until I did. I was instantly drawn into the story and finished it quickly. This book both tells a story and gets its message across so well . This book made me laugh and cry and put alot of thought into my own family and what is important. Every parent and child should read this book, and talk about it. And EVERYONE should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. Though that is not the only lesson to take from this story it is unmistakeable."
5,Mick Harte was here,"The book Mick Harte was here is a book I would recommned to everyone. You can learn something by reading this book. When you read this book it may make you cry and laugh.This book has the whole package. It was written by Barbara Park,who makes pretty good books.The first part of this book is about a girl telling you about how her brother had died.Then she tells you how before he died,how he use to act.Next how they took his death. It is a lotmore things to this story so go to the libery to get Mick Harte Was Here.by Janesha B."
3,sort of sad read,"The book ""Mick Harte Was Here"" was a little sad. This book mad me think about accidents they could happen to any one at any time. This book is about a nice fellow named MIck Harte who was never a trouble maker and should of never died but did. Mick Harte was a boy who sadly died in a bike accident. His sister Phoebe Harte trys to get through the struggel of her brothers death. In this book Phoebe tells things that have happened with her and her brother,and tells She tells all kinds off memories she had in this book. Mick does'nt want to.The mom of Mick feel to take for the blame because she didnt make him wear his helmet and if he did he would be alive. I think the point of this book was one to allways wear your helmet. And anything can happen, good or bad, expected or unexpected people can allways get hurt no matter what their doing because accidents happen."
5,Tear-jerker!,"This book was so hard to put down! It made me bawl. Maybe some people don't like that kind of story, but I love it! It makes a person think about losing a sibling or anyone for that matter. It reminded me of my relationship with my brother. I have to say this again, I love this book!"
4,Mick Harte Was Here,"The story Mick Harte Was Here is about a 12- year- old boy named Mick Harte. He was riding home when boom! He falls off his bike and hits his head on a truck. Well, when his death occurs, everything turns around. Mick's mom and dad are depressed as is his sistert, Phoebe. They all are moping around and being lazy, and Phoebe's about to go crazy with people asking about Mick. Finally towards the end of the book, Nana comes from Florida and has the family eat together. The book's title comes from Phoebe who wrote in the cement Mick Harte Was Here. I recommend that people should read this book because it is really interesting. That's what Mick Harte Was Here is all about."
4,Mick Harte Was Here,"Mick Harte is a good story. Mick and Phoebe Harte fight over stupid things, like a cereal toy. Also Mick loved to talk to the pictures of Wocket that were around his mirror. Mick died by getting hit by an on-coming truck and hitting his head.I liked this book because Phoebe, the older sister, loved her brother, Mick. Then when Nana from Florida lived with the family, she made dinner every night. Also Nana got the whole family to sit and eat at the dinner table together. Mick Harte is a fun read, and I recommend it!"
5,The PAIN-FREE BACK 6-Step Plan WORKS!,"I read McIlwain-Bruce's book ""Pain-Free Arthritis"" and thought the ""Pain-Free Back"" looked good as well. I have been very pleased with both books. The resistance exercises, low-carb ""pain-free"" diet, healing foods and alternative therapies fit well into my daily routine. Great book and mostly great relief from pain!"
1,Not worth your time or money,I kept reading hoping to find something of importance but zip. The weightloss solutions are to find a fad diet out there that you like. The exercises are nothing new. Save your money and go take a yoga class.
2,Could Be Better,"The polka music on this cd is great. However, they made the mistake of putting lame vocals on every song. With no vocals, this would have been a great cd."
2,Disappointed,"This review has nothing to do with the content of the book, only the quality. What a disappointment! I bought this book as a gift and was horrified at the quality of the book when I saw it. Why should there be pages missing and messy, hard-to-read sections in a book I paid over $35 for? I could go to a copy machine and do better than that myself."
3,A disappointment,"I'm a big fan of P. D. James's mystery novels, so I looked forward to getting to know her better in this book. I guess fame has ruined her. She comes across as opinionated and self-righteous, and drops names to impress us. She's not a person I'd want to sit next to on a train."
3,Time to Be in Earnest,"As an avid fan of PD James's pyschological thrillers, I was looking forward to a good read from her ""fragment of autobiography"". Ms James wrote a memoir for one year - the year of her 77th birthday. It is both a daily diary and a reflection of the past - both personal and historic and has commentary on her writing and books. I found it mostly interesting, but at times very dry. Perhaps we are conditioned to expect too much in the way of personal anguish to be satisfied with bare bones, but I felt that was what we were mostly given. I would recommend it for Ms James'fans, but perhaps not more widely."
4,P.D. James in Her 77th Year,"In addition to being one of the best contemporary mystery writers, P.D. James has an extraordinary command of the English language. Her book, a combination diary of her 77th year and a reflective looking back, is a must read for her fans. Some parts relating to her personal life, such as having a baby while bombs were being dropped during World War II and her relationship with her cat Polly-Hodge, make for interesting reading. Other parts about the more technical aspects of book writing and publishing, with the exception of her comments about adapting her books into TV movies, tend to be dry and would hold more appeal to writers and those in the publishing business."
3,Ms. James is better at fiction.,"I've enjoyed all of P. D. James' fiction works, but found the fragment of autobiography interesting, but a bit tedious. The book is interesting in that her life is filled with drama, trials, and turmoil; tedious in the multiple social and literary events that are recited. I can only surmise that the author herself really was not interested in keeping the diary and found it tiresome."
3,"Beautifully written, as always, but a bit disappointing","I have loved P.D. James mysteries for years and looked forward to getting a glimpse of the author herself. While the book is extremely well-written, as her books invariably are, I found it somewhat disappointing. I found it to be, more than anything, a rather uninteresting description of daily events in 1997 -- luncheons or dinner parties she attended, speaking engagements, conversations with friends and so forth. In addition, I was slightly put off by what seemed to me to be a rather stuffy and self-satisfied tone to the book. I look forward to her next effort -- fiction only, please."
3,Too Earnest,"P.D.James writes wonderful novels, but this autobiographical sketch of one year in her life is not her best. The year she has chosen to relive for us, 1997, seems to be one continuous round of speaking engagements interspersed with frequently stuffy opinions on English political and social issues. Her discussions of writing and writers were of the most interest to me and I wish she had spent more time talking about her own writing and research.Her opinions of the House of Lords were a bit self-serving. Back to Adam Dalgleish, I say!"
3,"Writing a book, or is it just a movie without the projector?","I wasn't sure that I could finish this book after I had read the first half. It seemed disjointed, with no real detail but a bunch of actions thrown together. Each action was meant to catch the attention, and did mine. However, the transition from action to action reminded me of the camera work on NYPD Blue. This may work on TV, but in a book it almost makes you wish you could get seasick.On the other hand, the last half of the book seemed to come together and flow better. In any case, it would make a better movie than a book. Sly Stallone as Evan ""Rambo"" Scott might actually attract some interest, and it would be much better than ""Judge Dread""."
5,"Deep, wide and rich.","His actions scenes are among the best since Howard, his inner glimpses profound, his characters full-fleshed.The Dond. ""Detective"" Rao. Young Bhose.Just amazing.His seemingly oblique references to Afghan Tribesmen, Kipling, cabinet making, home design, and a host of other minutae, can possibly cause the less well read casual ""thriller"" reader to lose the thread (s).Thoughts, feelings, ideas and memories comprise much of the book, and our 2 and 3 star reviewers were obviously out of their literary depth.This book is action literature, in the manner of Thomas Harris in his prime."
2,Negative Karma-No Stone City,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. I loved Stone City and was hoping for some of the same. This is a very pedestrian thriller using cardboard Kali characters as villans. Feels that the author was just going through the motions. Eric Von Lustbadder did it much, much better with his book called Ninja. Mitchell Smith is a great writer but this is not a great book. Sorry, JJM"
3,clc tool pouch,"I was tired of losing tools. I bought this tool pouch, it is light, has alot of space even pockets for pens, shapies,pencils, etc and like for small paperwork or notes. I have alot of hand tools so a packed it. The only thing I didnt like it doesnt close all the way, but it still closes to where if your bag tips over everything will not go flying everywhere."
5,Maintenance review,"This is an exccelent product, I work maint for a vary large company.I work around powdered milk production machines.This bag keeps powder away from my tools after I sanitize them.I love it. Im looking into getting the rest of my maint crew to buy one.all 45 of them."
4,Good quality but too small for network essential tools,Can't close zipper with just the essential network engineer's tools. It would be 4.5 stars if it was a tad bigger.
3,"Nice thought, but could be better.",The dividing pockets are a hindrance and could be replaced with a simpler setup which would fit the tools better.
5,This is one great tool bag,"I bought this tool bag to put electrical maintenance tools and it's perfect. There are numerous pockets to hold everything from my tong meter & tone generator to a pair of scissors. I like the fact that the flap secures tools when not in use and the flap contains a compartment for test leads. The shoulder strap is handy, there is a carrying handle and a loop to run a belt through.With regards to the shoulder strap I thought it was silly but it is incredibly convenient. When carrying tools from my car I sling it over my shoulder and have hands free to carry other stuff-nice feature."
5,Man Pouch,"I love this product,I use it all the time.Many slots for tools and more tools.I also like the zipper pouches for important pieces."
4,complicated...,"OK, so for less than $30, this bag is a steal. Unfortunately, this bag still doesn't provide all the functionality that a field service engineer would expect. I would pay $100 for a bag that does what I need it to do: hold insulated screw drivers, tweaker drivers, a flash light, USB drives, insulated pliers, wire strippers, hex wrenches, adjustable wrenches, electrical tape, measuring tape, spare wire nuts, a LARGE Fluke multimeter with space for extra leads, and ALL that UNDER A ZIPPER ENCLOSURE. This bag doesn't have that much room, and in fact, it has a bunch of internal pockets that are useless and unnecessary. I will probably cut out half the pockets to make room for a multimeter."
4,Good Book to read,"I enjoyed this book very much. My only problem is that it didnt make me feel that I earn over $100,000 a year."
4,Hardly boring at all,"Well a previous review said this toy was boring and was too expensive. If you have an imagination then your fun is endless. As for price, this is a special edition doll with elaborate clothing , AND you get a DVD movie. A doll AND a dvd, (...) thats a bargain."
1,Pictures very misleading,"I bought this doll and others in the series specifically for the accessories shown. I make OOAK dolls and other vignettes. The accessories shown DO NOT all come with these dolls. The beautiful masks, extra purses, hair clips, etc shown are not part of the package. You only get the 1 plain mask per doll, and a random purse, not the extra(s) shown.The clothing is of very poor quality, and Butterfly wings are just paper.If you just want them for play, your experience might be different."
5,Warning this is a real review !,"Very pretty doll,I gave several of these to kids aged 5 to 11 in the past few months and they all loved this doll. The DVD was a little childish but then again this is supposed to be for kids :)This makes a great gift !(And to the kids fighting about Bratz/My Scene,it really looks like your moms should be spending money on tutors instead of dolls.)"
4,SHUT UP,"YOU GUYS ARE SO STUPID! OKAY, SO I'M 16 BUT HEY, THIS AS A DOLL YOUR FIGHTING ABOUT!! And 1. this doll is not ugly but if you think so, then why don't you go look at the worlds most PRETTIEST DOLLS!! ANYWAYZ IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT OVER SOMETHING, FIGHT OVER SOMETHING LIKE, I DUNNO! NOTHING!! JUST STOP FIGHTING AND SHUT UP!!"
5,Bratz vs MyScene,"All of you Bratz fans need to get over your hang-ups about MyScenes. You will continue to enjoy your big headed, big lipped, artificial footed Bratz. Barbie came off the line in 1959,they came well before any of the others! The MyScenes were a spin off of Barbie and include a Barbie. Get over it girls. It sounds like the mean comments that are made in a public school when one child is jealous of another or what they wear,they only wish they could have it! Get over it already!!!!"
1,"Cheap, ugly, stupid!!!",Bratz are much cooler and nicer whilst THESE other dolls will never be ANYTHING to the Bratz soo DREAM ON MY SCENE FANS BRATZ ARE WAY BETTER!!
1,i feel sorry for people.....,"i seriously feel sorry for the not-bright people that have been brainwashed by the evil my scene creators who think that they can get rich quick by making and manufacturing these loads of crap, when we could easily get them from our toilets. why, you ask, would i pay for these punk wannaB's that just make evil smiles to make them look cool??? because the stupid people that would buy one were already brainwashed into thinking that they would also become cool if they get one......but it only makes them look really stupid and wannaB-ish. kids, i seriously warn you; if you want to play with some modelled crap, get some from your toilet. but if you want to pay for modeled crap, then go waste your money on these punk wannaB's and other junk."
1,I HATE MY SCENE!!,"Ok, I hate my scene and I'm here to tell you why. Well, for millions of reasons!!! Here are 10:1.They are ugly2.They copied diva stars and bratz3.They are BORING!!!!4.They are stoopid5.They are REALLY ugly6.No one likes them7.All they talk abot is FASHION, FASHION and FASHION8.Bratz are better than them9.Even my scene guys are ugly10.I HATE THEM!!!!#1 MY SCENE HATER!!!!!!!"
1,Can You Say Poser?,"The My Scene dolls are such posers! They're nothing but wanna'be Bratz (and need I remind you that the Bratz are way cooler!) This Masquerade Madness doll is a copy of the Funk n' Glow Bratz and she doesn't even look half as pretty. Why can't Mattel just except the fact that ""Barbie's Pink Reign of Idiotic Terror"" is OVER. GIVE UP MATTEL MY SCENE HAS NOTHING ON THE BRATZ DOLLS!~From: Kazami Ami a BRATZ fan"
1,Ummmmm,"Well, i just have to say that i'm surprised with Mattel..After they make such lovely Barbie dolls, they go and design something way far from beautiful..I am sorry, but i just don't think these dolls are very beautiful, compared to Bratz and Barbie..Ruth Handler is probubly very disapointed with these dolls, or, she would be."
1,lol this is gross,this is gross cuz its pretty. pretty is bad. i hate my scene they are not ugly like bratz bratz rawk they made me skinny and obsessed with my fashion sense lol lol lol lol!!!!!
2,I wrote the Please read why is there a fight here review,"I am happy with the people who reviewed this doll. You know what? My mom was AFRAID of bratz when she first saw them. She only lets us have the little ones. And of course we all know that Diva starz and Barbie are made by the same company. Once I read a whole review about some kid blabbing over and over about how My scene copied Diva starz. They said one my scene had a diva starz's hair, style, eyes, skin...and so on for each girl. I am saying to all those positive girls...THANKS A WHOLE LOT!!!!:)I really apreaciate that you are doing this. I'm also thanking the people who didn't fight about who's better: my scene or bratz. I'm just sharing my opinion and I don't mean to hurt anyone feelings I usually don't get on someone's nerve like this...just LISTEN TO YOU! For the person who said Kenzie was the ugliest my scene, she the prettiest my scene. For the LoOoOoOsErS person you are acting strange! And I am a my scene fan, no matter what you say."
5,STOP THE ARGUMENT!,"You guys are probably all older than me, and you still fight like little babies!! We are supposed to be reviewing this doll. If you want to say how great Bratz dolls are, review one! Besides, to change a Bratz shoe you have to take off their foot lol. You are wasting people's time. They want to buy a My Scene doll and are seeing this one's reviews and they see: ""Blah-blah-Bratz, Blah-blah-ugly, blah-blah-copying. Just sheesh the argument like a person with sense! I'm sorry for taking up your time with this long notice, but I've been reading these messages...somebody said they'd seen friends braking up because of dolls! You guys are making this the second worst after World War I and II, so quit it!Thank you to the nice reviewers. Stop fighting to the fighters. Both Bratz and My Scene are very good products, so if you're wondering what to buy...buy both, and see which you like better, and then don't argue on Amazon!"
1,I HATE IT,MY SCENE is the DUMBEST name eva and these things r just barbies with huge dememted heads. BUY BRATZ! they are cool and way better 4 kids. my scenes just shop and date. BRATZ R WAYYYYY COOLER! dont waste ur $ on this CRAP!!!
5,"It's myscene,myscene............","O my gosh she is very beautiful.OH! and her cute little pup so cute!I love her hair,wings,clothes.Except the wings are just like paper!Mattel good job I love it keep up the good work!!!!;)"
3,I wrote the Please Read review and I'm here again,"YES!!! Thank you, Megan Sweet lil angel112! I finally found someone who explains perfectly. I think that it's okay to say something like, ""This doll really was kinda ugly. Bratz are better."" But you don't need to get on everyone's nerves and say, ""THESE DOLLS ARE THE MOST UGLIEST EVER! THEY TOTALLY STINK!"" and stuff like that. Again, I am trying to just stop the fighting, not to hurt your feelings. Please forgive me if I did."
5,You guys are mean,"You say somebody is bad because they like my scene. I don't really like my scene that much it's just that I like them better than bratz. And to that girl who says I am a my scene slave, you write cruel and hurtful things. You almost made me consider suicide, they were that mean. You act like you want to kill every single my scene fan. Please, Amazon is a place for opinions, not insults."
4,A blend of African and jazz vocals,"Don't attempt to neatly niche Gino Sitson's SONG ZIN: it just won't work - his music is a blend of African and jazz vocals and is so intrinsically interwoven between both traditions that it's impossible to separate one from the other.Jazz vocalist Sitson's style comes closest to Bobby McFerrin, blended with a distinct Cameroonian vocal style and female backup singers who add touches of gospel, blues and traditional African at the drop of a hat."
5,Sharing her experience,"This is a wonderful read, anecdotal and full of many practical tips. I am a new mother of twins and I appreciated so much about this book. Jane Seymour shares her experiences in a loving, open manner. She talks woman-to-woman about how the pregnancy went for her. There are also several comments by her husband telling things from his point of view. With boxed factual information set amid the text and photographs, it is a fast read rather like a diary or memoir. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."
2,Ego Mania,"If your looking for a book to help you cope with being pregnant with twins, buy a different book. This book didn't give any advice for the common expecting mother. She goes on about how she couldn't sleep so she had a special chair made for her, her clothes didn't fit so she had them specially made for her. She brags about all the gifts she got for the babies, all the help she had once they were born, and how she lost all her weight weeks after delivery. This isn't a book for reality minded mothers-to-be. The only good part were the co-author's little comments (her doctor) they were the only factual, informative part of the book, unfortunately, her doctor didn't write enough to make it worth the money."
1,She needs a clue,"Jane Seymour will never really know what it is like to raise twins, and therefore can't offer any practical advice. Get a full time nurse?? Get real."
1,"get a life, jane!","As another reader put it, Jane will never know what it's REALLY like to have twins-most of us can't afford a baby nurse, let alone a nutritionist, personal trainer, chef, etc. She's unbelievable! Do not buy this book unless you want to be depressed."
1,Useless (except as a psychological document),"This woman lives in cloud cuckoo land. Her advice has absolutely no bearing on most people's everyday reality, and she comes across as a rich, spoilt, pampered woman who has no idea how ordinary people live. This book offers much insight into its author, but very little practical advice for real people. By all means purchase the book if you're sufficiently wealthy and morbidly self-obseesed."
1,I had to give it one star because there was no option for zero...,"Okay this is my first Amazon review ever. You know how you read the reviews, and even if they're bad, you get the book anyhow? Try to give it a chance or whatever? Okay trust me on this one. DON'T DO IT. Right now, the book has a two-star average on Amazon--and I think that's generous at best. Not only does this woman have the special chaise lounge (as mentioned by another reviewer) that's carted EVERYWHERE for her, she also has breakfast (some fancy egg white omelet and extra crunchy hash browns) made for her every morning, maternity clothes crafted expressly to fit her body--and when she decides that the shower adjacent to her new nursery isn't gonna cut it, she has a bathtub put in instead. Huh? Oh and she suggests 24-hour baby nurse care and someone to come do your laundry twice a week. Beg your pardon? Can she suggest the lotto numbers, too? The limited medical advice can be found elsewhere, in other books with actual substance."
1,Living in Fairyland,"What a waste! This was more a fictional novel than a book that offered practical advise. I was so looking forward to reading a biography on a real twin pregnancy and was dissappointed to read about a womans ""diversion"" while being spoilt on set by her lavish lifestyle and ""wonderful"" husband. Don't buy this book if you really need some practical advise."
2,"If you have unlimited resources, this is for you.","Jane Syemour has written a wonderful book about having twins -- as long as you have almost unlimited resources as she has, such as a staff of people, and even designers to make your life easier. Not for real people. Stick to ""Having Twins"" by Elizabeth Noble."
5,Glenn Miller died during World War II leaving us a legacy.,"""In the Christmas Mood II"" is disc 2 of a three-disc box set titled ""In the Christmas Mood"" that I recently got from Amazon.Glenn Miller always wanted to put out a Christmas album and more than twenty years later, his old band members and arrangers made that dream a reality.These discs were recorded in stereo so that didn't have to be remastered or digital or any of that stuff.They are the best an American orchestra can give to the yuletide repetoire. If you like the Big Band sound, you cannot miss out on them."
5,"So revealing, and yet it is ""light stuff"" (in your words).","I felt as though I were reading about my own person's life experiences while reading this book. Although I was raised in America, I was sent to Catholic school for 11 years as a child, knowing I would never be a part of that culture. I have since returned ""home"", just as Malidoma did, and begun my trek on the path of self-realization. But, as Malidoma points out, he did not (and cannot) give you the full ""4-1-1"" on the cultural practices. . . those who are not on the path simply are not allowed to know. Thus, this indeed is ""light stuff"".""When the student is ready, the teacher will come."""
2,One human's torturous removal from his home and culture.,A moving account of an young man experiencing early in his life the wisdom of an elder and then taken away from his tribe and indoctrinated into a life of missionary brainwashing. Malidoma's mission in this world was clearly to pioneer back to his roots and experience two cultures. Thank the higher powers that be.
5,Without repeating others,This book is a transformative agent that releases the Western mind of all false concepts of spirituality and the spiritual world. I highly recommend this book. Recognize that you will not be the same after completing this journey in the form of literature. Bless!
5,Changed My Life,"This book is key. You read this and want to say ""These things can't be possible....just can't be real."" But the lessons are full of truth, and the author is sincere. This story can be comprehended and felt deeply by all of those who have been subject to Christian indoctrination."
2,not like new,"When I was searching for the book I decided on one that said ""Like New,"" but when I received it there was a ripped page and a lot of water damage. How is that Like New?"
5,What a journey!,"With this book, Malidoma Patrice Some opens the door to a whole new way of looking at the world; one in which spirits (ancestor and otherwise), magic, wisdom and community come together as one. I was mesmerized by this story and by the possibility it presented for a deeper understanding of this life and how it can be lived. Hold on to your hat!"
3,Ok.,I usually love Gunnar's DVDs. I own almost all of them and this one just doesn't add up to usual standards. I felt like the main focus of the DVD was Brooke Burke and not abs at all. The camera just kept zooming in on her face and abs. Gunnar also only chose maybe 4 moves and kept repeating them constantly. Yawn. Moving on to another ab DVD...
2,Disappointing,"I did not like the suggestions from this book one bit. The book basically suggests that you appeal to your child's desire to fit in and convince them that sucking his or her thumb will make them appear silly or ""like a baby"" to their friends. I don't like this approach because I'd be telling my four-year-old son that he should pattern his behavior after his friends' which is something I will want to discourage when he grows older. He also wasn't thrilled with the book, its story or its pictures."
2,Skip this book and get Mavala Stop.,"I read the first part of this book to my daughter and although it is well written, it uses guilt to motivate the child to stop which I didn't think would be best. I then tried the flavored nail polish ""Mavala Stop"" and that worked for good: no socks, no charts, no dental appliances, no talk, nothing."
2,Nothing new,The kids dentist recommended to help get the kids to stop sucking fingers and thumb. Nothing new in book that we hadn't already tried. Way to expensive for this.
1,Utter garbage,"The authors of this book do not understand the big picture with regard to computer systems and network architecture. Crandall and Levich whine about the alleged ""conspiracy of parts"" without a clue as to the development of processor and bus structures, and as to the how and why of Moore's law. This book is sufficient to annoy and frustrate any IT professional."
4,Nightmare In Pink,"Aw come on, Travis, you can do it! Poor fellow has to pull out all the stops in order to salvage the poor young thing."
4,"Not the best in the series, but still great.","This is a bit slow in the beginning, but gets better as it goes along. The ending is great, too."
4,Rediscover Travis MaGee,"With the new release of MacDonald 's Travis MaGee books I'm going to start rereading them, after a long hiatius. My discovery of Donald Westlake has led me back to mysteries an thrillers there are very few better than MacDonald."
2,Sadly The Worst In The Series,Even though I truly enjoy the Travis McGee series this was the only one that I feel is not up to the standard of entertainment as the others. It wasn't as riviting and many times I just wanted to skip to the end. This is the only one in the series that I think should be avoided.
3,Second installment in the Travis McGee series,"I once dated a guy who was always quoting Travis McGee. It's not often that a genre fiction hero is a source of quotes. But it is the philosophical aspect of McGee that keeps this series from being a totally dated antiquity. Travis loves women. Travis is a chauvanist, but a thoughtful one. This is only my second McGee novel (trying to read them in order) but I find myself most entertained by his musings on women, loyalty to friends, work and - in this book - the role of New York in the downfall of humanity.The plot is described only too well in other reviews. Suffice it to say that most of the action takes place in the third quarter of the book with a medical scenario that would make Robin Cook proud. It's all a bit far-fetched but the pages turn easily enough. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars overall if the system allowed."
3,Good pix.,"Beautiful pictures, but the storyis a bit weak and perhaps toopolitically correct. Not a bad book,though."
2,Not happy,"I loved this series...until this book. It felt rushed and unbelievable.For example: The thirty something Annie falls for the sixty something doctor after having already dated the doctor's son. Not only does she fall for him, but she blurts out her intentions and all is well between them. Huh?The characters lost the qualities I loved so much in them. It began to feel like a soap opera....only worse.I'm sorry, but this book really fell short. I wish the author's had a chance to do it over."
5,even better,THESE DOLLS ARE BETTER THAN 4 EVER BEST FRIENDS. NOT THAT 4 EVER BEST FRIENDS ARE BAD. THEY ARE NICE BUT THESE U GET MORE ACCESSORIES AND DOLLS FOR THE SAME PRICE.
2,"Bratz, stay in your place!","It won't be long until these cheap, wannabe poser dolls are off the market, and you can go back to living your everyday lives.I HAVE some of these dolls. But now i think they are too similar to Bratz. I have NINE Bratz. Bratz are REAL collector dolls. Thats why they are so expensive. These dolls are POSERS!!! I mean, LOOK at that fake grin!"
5,"jason, freddy,michael, leatherface, king kong all rock","This is so coooooooollllll! It is great for your collection. I'm a big horror fan and love this. He comes with 3 cool accessories. Ann Darrow, and a bug called the weta rex, and a vine to swing on. This is one of the best kongs I have. The others are kong vs fish thing, kong vs dinoasur,furry kong t rex, and bugs of kong. He can hold on to lots of things and it only cost 9 dollars so get yours today."
5,Easy meal to build on with own additions,"we use this as the base, then besides the chicken, we will also add pasta, spices, veggies, or whatever we have around to make quick cheesy meals"
4,"Always loved Truly, MAdly Deeply",Now that I have my mp3 I have been revisiting past songs I just loved. This album has a few good tunes.
4,Sweet Music,"I am pleased with the purchase. I was looking for this music specifically and was not disappointed. I enjoy this duo as they have a nice quality to their voice and have nice romantic lyrics. If that is what you are looking for, than this is a great CD to add to your collection."
4,"Pretty good, but not a Best of","I have to agree that this could have been better due to certain track choices. And instead of having the dvd they could have input another cd and had a complete library of Savage Garden songs including all the B-sides the two Darren Hayes songs on this cd and the never released in America song ""Mine"" which I have to say is one of their best.All in all I don't regret getting it, but it could have better."
4,"Kenny Mac, Mad Soundz (Australia)","after 6 years apart, the best of savage garden cd has finally been released & i am happy to have a copy of my own. the album definetly does not disappoint except songs such as ""gunning down romance"", ""two beds & a coffee machine"", ""i don't know you anymore"", ""carry on dancing"", ""universe"" and ""mine"" which were great songs could have been on there. the two songs by darren hayes were awesome and better than ever. my fav. song would have to be ""i knew i loved you"". Fantastic album overall"
1,Where's the goods???,"They have had this in the works for years, and all they could come up with is the same material most of us die-hard fans already have? Why bother releasing it? Sony never had time to properly promote the band when they were successful on the label and now they are trying to sell this cheap knock-off to the fans at a not-so-cheap price. Not to mention we can't even properly play the DVD on our USA DVD-players. This item is not worth the money, especially if they can't even take the time to include rare material and release it officially in the U.S. for the fans that helped make Savage Garden successful to begin with. Highly disappointed with this product."
3,I am pleased,I bought this CD for one song and was pleased to find a couple others that I didn't know were on here. I am pleased with my purchase.
5,"Savage Garden - Truly, Madly, Completely","This CD appeals to young and old alike. The music itself always puts me in a good mood! If you like easy-going rock music that will stay with you, don't hesitate to buy this one!"
1,nothing like the picture shown,"Picture showed long bracket, was sent stubby brackets instead. Total rip-off, would never buy from again"
1,norma,Specs not provided. Received the brackets which are too small for the rail. Returning would not yield any return since brackets were $1.97 and shipping $4.20. So it was a waste of money.
3,Hollow stems,These would function better if the stems were solid instead of hollow.The drink all goes to the bottom of the stem!
3,Classy but fragile stemless wine glasses,"I have had two different sets of Riedel stemless wine glasses. Of the four that I have had, I have broken two of them. One I dropped on a short carpet with no pad, and the other I broke while I was cleaning it with a rag. They are very nice to have around, especially when your girlfriend's mom, who loves wine, needs a glass. She was impressed. You just need to be very careful with these or look for something that is stronger."
4,our new favorite wine glasses,I love these glasses. They do not tip over and the are large enough for the wine to breathe. I am only worried as they are so light and thin that they might break so I hand wash them. They are both my husband's and my favorite wine glasses and at that price I can afford to replace them!
3,Awkward to handle,"Not for people with small/medium hands. Difficult to hold while washing. Bowl not as easy to grab as a stem. Price is good for Reidel, but what's it matter if you don't use them?"
4,"Beautiful, Fragile","I bought these for my girlfriend, as she was complaining that she didn't have any classy wine glasses. She absolutely loves them. The stemless look seems to be what's ""in"" these days. She's had multiple friends ask where she got them. Only issue is that they are very thin and fragile. So far, I've only broken one :) She had placed it in the sink to be washed and I unknowingly placed a pot or something on top of it, causing it to break. Not totally my fault, by of course, I turned around and bought her another set of 2 to make up for it. So, though these are beautiful wine glasses, you have to be pretty careful with them. I'd recommend using them when you have company, and not as everyday glasses because of the fragility."
3,"good looks, design... eh","The bases are a little narrow which may make them top heavy. We notices they are a bit unsteady on uneven surfaces (ie table cloth, soft coaster etc). We like the design and quality feel."
4,"Great wine glass, when it ships in one piece","I've been using these glasses for 6 months and love them for casual wine drinking. They're great in that they go right into the dish washer with no problems and look beautiful coming out every time.I recently decided to expand the collection a little bit, and ordered eight more. The purchase went through Wine Enthusiast, and I wasn't expecting any issues since I've purchased directly from them in the past. However, and I thought you all might find this entertaining, a rather thin box showed up today and was not in great shape. I picked it up to the sound of raining glass shards inside. Upon opening the box, I found both tubes (each holding 4 glasses) almost completely smashed. I've gotten the occasional broken glass in a shipment before, but this is the first time I've received an entire box of broken glass. :-) Time to go talk to Wine Enthusiast about their shipping practices."
5,My favorite wine glass...,"I got a set of these as a gift and have fallen in love with them. I even went out and bought more include some of the riesling one which if you are looking for a smaller size are the way to go. They are light and wonderful to drink from and easy to care for. They handle the dishwasher very well. Cause although they seem so fragile and delicate they are excellent for day to day use. One did finally break in our home as one of our cats knocked a book from a shelf that cracked it. But I'm replacing it as I type. Having no stems also means less likely to be tipped over which for this home is a good thing.Over all an excellent day to day wine glasses, wonderful quality and good pricing. Makes a great gift for wine drinkers."
3,Good but not perfect,"Let me first say that Riedel's do enhance the taste of any wine and the idea behind the tumblers is good. Unfortunately they do smudge easily and have to be cleaned with soft water or they become cloudy. The manufacturer suggests washing them with only water, i.e. no soap, but this doesn't work for me."
1,Magic glasses,"While at a wine tasting room in Fredericksburg, Texas, we learned about the amazing ""riedel glasses."" They have the ability to make a so-so wine taste as good as its pricier counterparts. It was explained to us that it's due to the shape, lack of stem, special crystal, etc., but we just say it's magic!!!There is a different glass for each type of wine - red, white, etc."
4,Great but not dishwasher safe,"I love these glasses. I've been using them since Riedel started making the ""O"" series. But I want to correct the information provide by Amazon. These glasses are not dishwasher safe. I always hand wash them but a guest snuck them into the dishwasher when I wasn't looking and I forgot to do the ""guest precheck"" on my dishwasher before running. We lost three of the pinot noir glasses to the dishwasher. So I would say great glasses if you are willing to hand wash."
5,I'm a Convert!,"Initially thought stemless wine glasses were dumb. Then got the whole set of ""O"" glasses (4 sizes) as a gift, and realized how wrong I was! Love them so much I've given away all my stemmed glasses. Hold up well in the dishwasher."
2,super breakable!,were great until they broke in the sink while washing... too fragile for everyday use.
4,Also good for your morning orange juice,"My ordinary juice tumblers are wearing out, so I'm trying alternatives for a new set. So far, I'm very happy with these. They have all the qualities of the inexpensive Riedel line, including being able to go in the dishwasher. And sure 'nuff, I can tell a difference between a glass of riesling, even *cheap* riesling, by drinking it out of this glass. (My major experiment was using a bottle of wine that was merely okay. The glass made it a *better* okay. I think it still ended up in a fondue.)The glasses are just a tiny bit fragile for everyday use, but I'm comparing them to heavy juice clunkers rather than a wine glass. They do make my morning juice look cool. If you're thinking of them for wine service, though, they don't seem quite as elegant as stemware... on the other hand, it'll be a lot harder to knock one of these over."
1,Break too easily,"Hi,Really like drinking wine from these glasses. Ended up with 8 each in two sizes. Broke my 4th glass the other day while cleaning it. NEVER broke any other end-high stemware doing that. Believe me, I've been very careful too.Also had one break in a very modern dishwasher operating on a crystal cycle.Just too thin and fragile despite the resonable price and good functionality"
4,Fun glasses,"I love Riedel glasses and these are no exception. These are great for casual wine drinking ~week day dinners or just a couple of friends drinking and chatting.Sure they don't have a stem, but I rarely hold the glass in my hand the entire time I have a glass of wine so the wine doesn't heat up anyway. Elegant but durable, they fit in the dishwasher. And they are spill proof.If I set a fancy table, I still turn to my beautiful stemmed wine glasses."
2,Too big,These glases are too big for practical use. Instead we recommend the Chardonnay/Voigner model.
3,Interesting add to any Riedel collection,"Nice- good for the toast w/ friends or any special occasion. I wouldn't trust them in the dishwasher (thin, and breakable)."
1,Flimsy Glasses,Paper thin glasses; a two year-old could crush them like beer cans. Sincerely disappointed in Riedel. They are no better than Ikea glasses.
5,Versitile glassware...,"Love these glasses. Can see them being used for many types of drinks, not just red wine. Only drawback is fingerprints show up well."
4,Stemless Wine Glasses,"I bought them for someone this is what they said - ""I think they do enhance the flavor of the wine. They seem to be of really fine quality (very thin glass but not fragile). and with no stem, I don't have to worry about knocking them over so easily."""
3,Great but BE VERY CAREFUL!,"I really would like to give these 5 stars, but I was able to use mine only 3 times before one broke in the dishwasher. Not from the machine, just from bumping it as I put it in.I am always very careful with my dishes, and couldn't believe how easily it broke.I do love the idea of these however. Waterford has a great set that is a bit thicker if you are worried about breaking."
4,Red Wine Tumblers,"Product met expectations, at a very competitive price. These glasses claim to oxygenate the wine and do seem to improve the taste of wine even if it is only in my head.Only dislike was the poor packaging which was very flimsy. Amazingly these very delicate glasses arrive in one piece. I will probably buy some more for various types of other wines."
3,Nice,"These are nice glasses - a little big for my hand - I always feel like it could easily slip out. I like the stemless;, but it is very thin glass. We haven't broken any, but we do feel as if they would break easily. We ordered 4 and use them for ""every day"", but probably will not order more."
3,Impractical (red) wine glass,"Beautiful, delicate crystal, however the glass is so large it is impossible to grip safely, you need to support the base with your little finger."
3,thin glass,the glasses are thinner than most other martini glasses which makes them very delicate and can be easily broken. otherwise they are very pretty
2,not user friendly,"Altho the quality seems good, the size is so large for a woman to hold, fear of dropping! This is very thin glass and seems like it will break easy and is hard to hold onto to wash. won't buy more."
4,Nice wine glasses,"I bought some of these as a gift when they first came out and have wanted them ever since. Very nice feel, thin crystal rim, goood for swirling. The only problem is they are somewhat hard to hold because they are so big around."
5,A must for Riedel fanatics!,"These are amazing! Exactly the same as the Vinum line, minus the stems. The bowl is identical so you still get the breathing and flavor distinction you've come to expect from Riedel. They're just a bit more casual - perfect for a picnic or going out on your porch or patio to enjoy wine with friends or sitting around a fireplace. No worries about the stem breaking or finding a perfectly level place to set them down as they're like weebles - they'll wobble, but don't fall down. At about half the cost - if you like Riedel Vinum, you'll quickly be building your collection of the O line. One note, if you're a fanatic about the wine temperature, you may want to stick with the reds as you ARE holding the bowl while drinking, but I've not yet had that issue. What a great concept!"
4,"Unusual, great glasses","These are incredible glasses! Very high quality, sleek glasses that feel great in your hand and look great on your table. As the shape is different, they make an excellent conversation piece. They are good wine glasses if you are sitting down or have the opportunity to place your glass down often; they're not good for wine at cocktail parties or instances where you have to hold your glass often - holding them in your hand often will warm them quickly. They also make great beverage glasses for water, etc."
4,a bit less of a masterpiece than his others,"Okay, maybe I'm being picky because I'm on this Jonathan Carroll streak right now and just finished four of his other books before this one. Like his great books, this one has brilliant scenes, concepts and wild plot devices, but I found that it didn't hold together as well as his others. At times, it seems like even Carroll might have lost one of his own threads. This book made me appreciate how great his new one, Marriage of Sticks, is. If you haven't read anything by Carroll before, I'd stick to his others first. If you're a Carroll freak like I am, you'll want to search this one out. Rondua appears in this one too and you may recognize Finky-Linky and some of the usual suspects."
3,not his best,"I agree with the previous review, that this isn't the best book with which to acquaint yourself with Carroll. THE LAND OF LAUGHS might be the best place to start - or try his last book, THE WOODEN SEA. Truth be told, A CHILD ACROSS THE SKY falls far short of his other works. Its highlights are two short stories, both of which can be found in his terrific collection, THE PANIC HAND. The plotting of CHILD feels rushed and forced, and its themes slightly convoluted. Carroll's distinctive voice is very much present - and as always a pleasure to listen to. This just didn't hit the mark like so many of his others."
3,french women of old,"A very detailed study about how some women in the XVIII century France became leading ""locomotives"" in society, dictating the ways people shoud behave, talk and even think. It's interesting but a little too long and too detailed."
3,Didn't Grab Me,"First, I'll say that my review isn't AS relevant, because I haven't heard the whole CD straight through. My friend burned me a CD with 6 tracks on it from Poem.I have several ""older"" Delerium CDs, and really enjoy them. The wonderful mixture of electronics and world sounds really grabbed my attention. It was like listening to a creature made from a strange mixture of Godflesh, Dead Can Dance, and Tangerine Dream. They're great CDs just put on...and really listen to. They have a lot happening in them.My problem with Poem is that I really like the songs...until the singing starts. My personal feeling is that having singing on the tracks detracts from the great music behind it. I really get into the music...and then lyrics are thrust upon me.From the rest of the reviews I see that most people disagree with me. Those of you who like this CD, try listening to Spheres II, Morpheus, and Semantic Spaces. They're great CDs that give a really different and darker feeling than Poem."
4,This is my first but not my last Delerium!!,"I have no idea why I picked this one up... could be the pkging made an Impression. There were names I recognized... Sarah McLachlan, the Medieval Babes (sp)... thought I'd give it a try. Parts of the instrumental remind me of Robert Miles, so that element hooked me right away. Be sure to get this version with the extra tracks because 'Silence' is nothing short of amazing. I have to run a few errands today, and I'm planning on sliding this gem into the Bose in the car and cranking it."
2,"Delerium has gone pop, rather disappointing.","Despite the grandeur of ""Underwater"" on the first CD of this set and the excellence of the 2nd CD, I was overall disappointed with this release. It was prevalent that Delerium was heading this direction ever since ""Semantic Spaces"" but I wouldn't have expected it to happen this early. Kristy Thirsk was already pushing Delerium's style off the edge, however, it was a good combination. This CD is the landmark of Delerium's fall into commerciality. If you're into the popular type of stuff, then you might like this CD, but for someone that still prefers something such as ""Karma"", this just isn't for you.I hope Bill Leeb is getting enough cash off this, maybe he can do better with his already excellent projects such as Front Line Assembly."
2,Mediocre At Best,"I bought ""Karma"" a few years ago. It was the first thing I had ever heard by Delerium and I was blown away. So, when I saw that ""Poem"" had been released, I eagerly snatched it up. What I got was a big disappointment once the disc started to play. The whole CD reminded me too much of a group who had a hit and now wanted to reproduce the same success by not evolving in any way. Did they really need another remix of ""Silence"" featuring Sarah McLachlan?"
2,"TO MUCH SINGING,NOT MY FAVORITE CD","Been waiting for four years for the next Delerium album,but when peom came out for the 4th release,hasn't what I had expected from Bill leeb.This album is focus on singing with special artist,I was hoping for alots of instrumental beat music with gregorian chant and other culture sound.There a few song with gregorian chant which you might like,is call TERRA FIRMA & AMONGST THE RUINS.I don't know why Bill Leeb would do this,Mr.Leeb did great on the last two album Semantic Spaces & Karma.Poem doesn't do it for me,there's about 8 tracks with artist that sing and sing.Delerium Peom fail BIG TIME so I am dissappionted."
3,Luscious,"If you are a fan of the last two Nettwerk releases by Delerium, you may be in for a little surprise. This album is good but it lacks a certain sound. If the dark lush soundscapes are what you found most interesting with the last CD, you may find yourself popping Karma back in to the player. In my opinion Delerium is missing a key ingredient with Poem. Maybe it left with Rhys Fulber or maybe it's a new direction. Who knows really. All that aside this CD is worth buying. Try to get the double disc set for some killer remixes!"
3,Change of Styles Complete for Delerium,"And so it was that 'Poem' heralded the completion of the change in direction and style for Delerium. Gone were the dark, eerie, sharpe and solid ambient beats that made Delerium what it is today. It was replaced by a softer duller trance rythm that were sung by guest female vocalists. It was Delerium that made Sarah McLachlan famouse in her rendition of the hit Silence (which is a great song whatever variation it is played in).Innocente, Aria and A Poem for Byzantium would become hits for Delerium and recive some radio time and were remixed and became popular with mainstream music buffs. Most of the other songs are dry and lack the strength of early Delerium songs.Early Delerium fans may be disappointed with this album as was I alittle. It is a passable album for the songs I mentioned positively. Silence and A Poem For Byzantium were my favourites of this album."
3,Beautiful but empty,"I never heard of Delerium before I saw this album, so I can't compare this to their other albums. But this is a very nicely made, slightly vapid album in the tradition of Enigma, Dead Can Dance, Deep Forest and Mediaeval Baebes, with some late Cocteau Twins and some ambient beats thrown into the mix. Good background music for the most part. Standout tracks are Aria, Daylight, the Silence remix and the Flowers Become Screens version. The last two are only found on the bonus disc, so I'd say it's well worth getting the special edition. By the way, the very first sound on the album is a sampled water drum from Union Jack's excellent trance-ambient album ""There Will Be No Armageddon"". People who loved ""Poem"" may want to check that one out."
4,Hauntingly beautiful,Fans of Karma and Semantic Spaces will be pleased with Delerium's newest work of art.The double disc set has what will be many new favorites. The only minor downside is that there are too many artist's. The music lends cohesion for the disc. Despite this the disc is masterfully written and performed.The bonus four track disc has the best remixes of Silence and Flowers Become Screens outside the originals.You won't be disappointed.
5,More from the masters,"Delerium has come a long way from Morpheus way back when and their sound has changed dramatically. I really recommend this album, and Chimera, their latest. I am a die hard Delerium fan and listened to this album non-stop when it came out. This was probably due to the extremely different and ethereal sounds. There are too many good tracks on this album to pick one, but Innocente and Underwater are great. Simply amazing, a must buy!"
4,Great alblum,"I was really suprised to see another delerium alblum, because I thought that the group was split up, but as it ends up, bill leeb is doing it on his own now.Delerium continues to change with every alblum, and this is no exception. Poem continues the same progression that happened between semantic spaces and Karma. It has quite a bit of vocals to it, but thankfully, the songs do not depend on the vocals. And like I expected, the songs tended to be very happy, and haunting at the same time.My favorite songs are Aria, which sounds kind of like a christmass song to me, in a good way. I was at first sceptical of daylight because I wondered if a male singer would be able to match the feeling of the female singers, but I was promply proven wrong on that. A Poem for bizantiam is also a good song.I think that one of the reasons that I like delerium so much is that it is so spiritual. I would give it 4.5 stars, but to a certain degree I cant really rate it untill I have listed to it for a while."
5,Among my most favorite albums,"I bought this album not knowing what to expect, but was immediately hooked. I often leave this thing playing in my car over and over for several days. Each song has a different tone, but they all grab you and hold on. I wish I had a million albums like this one. The female voices are entrancing, yet the vocals of Matthew Sweet are fantastic as well. I am normally very picky about my music, but this album has me hooked! Get it!"
5,New to Delirium,"Before Poem by Delirium, I mostly had an interest in Latin pop. I was shopping one day and saw the cover of this cd and its unique packaging and just loved it. So I picked up the cd based on the packaging, as I had never heard any Delirium before. So I get to my car, open the packaging and slip the cd in. I loved it. This was my first taste of this kind of music and I loved it. This was a few years ago. This cd helped me open into accepting new sounds of music, and have been since. Delirium's Poem is definitely a great place to start if you never have listened to this type of music. I highly recommend it along with the other Delirium cds."
5,Delerium's best album...,"I wasn't a Delerium fan until the release of Karma in 1997. After buying Karma, I went backa nd bought their earlier work (and while it was good, I liked very few songs). Poem & Karma are my favorite CD's from Delrium. Every single track on this CD is good (of course some are better than others). Give it a listen and you are bound to fall in love with it as well."
5,Unexpected Wonder,"Forget that this album is Delerium. For good or bad, this album has its own flavor. I purchased this knowing that Nature's Kingdom and Aria were pieces that pulled me in every time I heard them, but I had no idea that the rest of album would be even better. The lyrical hooks and rythms are extremely well composed and keep you wanting more."
2,Very Disapointing,"As hard as this is for me to say, this is a terrible Delerium CD. A previous reviewer said the singing was the cause and I agree. I find most of the singing quite boring and often covers up some good music. The CD's only redeeming factor is the track Innocente which is fantastic. I hear this one will be released as a single so my advice is to skip Poem and buy just the single. I own many other Delerium CD's and this one just doesn't compare. Too bad."
5,Loved it,"I thought this was a very fun, innovative workout. Now I have another tape I can alternate with Boot Camp Training, both videos alternate cardio and strength training sessions which I really like. I thought it had alot of fun new moves, nothing complicated. It was a nice efficient workout. I've read other reviews on another web site that this workout was hard on knees, I didn't have a problem. I liked the instructor very much and hope they feature her in future videos. A winner!"
1,too fast and unsafe,"i love crunch fitness, when they were on ESPN2 I taped them and still workout to those. When i got this DVD i was bitterly dissapointed. There are movements in this viedo that should not be atempted by anyone with weights. (ie standing on one leg, kicking out and doing a shoulder press all at the same time). also the flow of the movements was not well coordinated. It was choppy and the putting of the weights up and down was just too much. Her cueing could be better."
4,"good workout, bad music",A nice little 30-minute workout with interesting moves but marred by some of the most annoying music this side of Kenny G.
3,Not that great,"I have been working out with videos for years and this one was one of the worst. The moves were annoying and didn't even make sense. I also didn't like the way she combined the moves. Some of the moves did really work, though, especially the triceps and the music had a great beat. The Crunch Boot Camp video is much better."
1,Cardio Sculpt is Amazing!,"I'm a mom of three. My youngest are twin daughters age three. I've been carrying about twenty pounds extra fat weight and have been having a hard time with other videos trimming down my hips and removing the bumpy fat down my legs, etc. I have been using this video for awhile now and WOW! I look great!!!!! I have lost all the weight and I feel all muscle, and is it ever a great feeling. I actually have a six pack now and no other video has been able to produce such amazing results, because believe me I've tried others combined with a healthy eating plan and this one really works! I recommend this video/DVD to anyone who really wants to feel that muscle tone. This video combines cardio with toning in perfect harmony. Cut down on the carbs and fat and calories combined with this workout and you're on your way to the body you've always wanted. I'm living proof it works!!!Sincerely,Reva ( Ontario, Canada )"
2,Not That Great,"I was not even sweating at the end of this workout - I found the moves to be out of synch - they did not flow easily from one to another - I was a dancer and fitness instructor for years and I found these moves very uncoordinated. The weights were picked up and put down too many times during the workout also, detracting from any consistent and steady fat-burning cardio session. Try Denise Austin's cardio-kickboxing workout - you can use light weights with this too for an even better workout."
5,Who Knew? It's a fantastic workout!,"I've worked our regularly for years and have grown bored of the gym. I'm not a big class person so I tried this video. I was so amazed at what a workout it is! I read previous reviews that some wrote, stating it wasn't a cardio workout- nonsense! They're not doing it right- if you put effort it this, you'll sweat big time and tone your body as well. In reality, 30 mins does the trick and for someone who gets tired of the 60-90 mins workouts, this is a refreshing change! I'm now onto the Bootcamp video!"
2,Great!!! if your a trapeze artist.,"Im sorry folks!!I bought this video based on other reviews,about how good it is.I admit she packs a lot of moves into the workout for a half an hour video, but what is with the balancing act with weights?,if I wanted to become a trapeze artist I would have joined the circus. I HATE this video, reach for it the least and I am just about ready to slam dunk it into the bin,but might twist my ankle doing it(the video)."
5,Great Workout,This is absolutely the best 30 minute workout. The concept of using two different sets of weights allows you to work at your own ability level. Violet is a great instructor and I hope to see her in more videos.
5,A great strength and cardio workout! Love it!,"I've bought most of the Crunch video series and love them all, but cardioscuplt, I must say is my favourite. It does bring your heart rate up while working more than one body part. The exercises are new and interesting,giving you the opportunity to take it at your own ability level,using two sets of different weights. I find that when I'm unable to make it to the gym, I can do cardiosculpt and know that I'll get a great total body workout. Violet is a pleasant instructor who walks you through the exercises, has excellent form ,and keeps you motivated for the entire 30 mins. It would be nice to see her in more videos. LOVE IT!!"
2,short and light on the cardio,"I bought this tape because I have several other crunch videos and enjoy them. But this one just didnt live up to what I had come to expect from them.Its a very short tape and I knew that buying it, but compared to ""Bootcamp"" this just doesnt pack the same punch. The cardio segments arent energizing enough and the weight segments are pretty light as well.If your looking for a short workout that has a cardio/sculpt mix and that will make you sweat get ""Bootcamp"" its a great video. Ive had it for almost a year and still reach for it about once a week as filler for more workouts."
3,Good for BEGINNERS!,Not enough cardio. I think this is more sculpting than any type of cardio workout. I barely even sweat with this workout! It would be great for beginners who do not lead active lifestyles. It is pretty easy to follow after viewing it a couple of times.
3,FAST FOR BEGINNERS,"First off let me say I am new to exercise, I wanted a workout I could do at home and tone up this flabby body. I use Zumba 6 to 7 days a week and love it! So i think i can go pretty fast for a beginner but then again Zumba is latin dance oriented. Any way I want to do this video badly because i think it would really work but every time I try Violet loses me in the warm up bringing in too many new moves adding to the list. Even my husband was suprised at how fast it goes at the beginning...I can't say much for the rest of it because I don't get past the beginning.So you are wondering if i don't get past the beginning why did I give it 3 stars. Because I would love to do it, Violet is great to listen to, motivating and energetic without being irritated, her having an Aussie accent is nice too. I like to listen to her and know if I ever progress to keeping up with her I would enjoy the workout."
3,too many fancy steps,I was hoping for a nice workout that I could do. I've been working out for years and years and still can't do all those fancy steps and moves. I have found the best success with Leslie Sansone videos. I want to like this but it just scares me to know I can't do it right.
5,"Simple, exact and excelent",When we see how much quantum mechanics pushed our civilization and how bad it became explained on 'modern' textbooks it is a relief to find out that this book is still published and affordable. A must for anyone interested in the subject or needing to understand it with the help of one of the fathers of QM.
3,Jesse Owens,"Jesse Owens was born in 1913 in Alabama.His mother and father or as they were sharecroppers.Jesse or as they called him ""JC"" was the youngest of his family.He was small and skinney. ""JC"" had a sickniss in his leg that his mother had to take out with a hot kichen knife.He calls that leg his lucky leg.In the 1920's the owens moved to Cleveland's black ghetto where he went to high school. He had to get a job shining shoes and sweeping floors in stores while going to school.In 1936,""JC"" won a gold medal at the Olypics that year and helped his team win."
2,Picture not true to product,The box was in a little bad shape.Picture did not show silver paint or nail polishon box(on the front). Felt that I was miss lead!
2,Dances around commodities...more philosophical than anything,"Larry Williams' book was something of a disappointment to me. Maybe I was expecting too much. Larry provides a great introduction to key ideas like premiums, open interest, and oscillators but sadly leaves the reader dangling. Much of the reading is more philosophical than scientific. For $50 dollars I expect details, not generalization. For example, Larry mentions that a change in open interest of 25% or more greatly excites him. A change over what time period? A day, week, what? To be fair, I'm very sure Mr. Williams is an excellent commodity speculator and very intelligent person. I just wish he would explain his ideas with a little more detail."
5,Classical Commodity Trading Manual,"The simplest stuff that works. This manual includes methods for trading the trend. Furthermore, it shows how to use fundamental data that is freely available to the small trader. That data is spread data, open interest data and committment of traders data. In addition to good fundamental information, the manual has technical trading methods and money management guidelines. Highly recommended"
1,Stay away,"A lot of the books on the bookshelves don't belong there-- some belong in your homes others the trash. This one is really bad. Larry Williams is a direct marketer not a trader. If you want to learn how to trade read Market Wizards, or Trade Your way to Financial Freedom, or how I made two million in the stock market-by Krubel which tells how he first lost money very badly and learned from his mistakes. Larry is a gambler, not a trader. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"
3,A bit vague but worthwhile,"Larry still teaches most of this material at his current seminars. He has refined the technique a bit and added a couple of new technical indicators, but his fundamental approach is the same. His ""million dollar tools"" are extremely useful for position trading and anyone who has the patience and discipline to take a little time and test the relationships outlined in this book should prosper. The relationships discussed in his book have stood the test of time and are among the most consistently profitable to this day."
1,This book gives people the impression trading is easy.,"Larry Williams is a snake-oil salesman, just like his buddies Jake Bernstein and Ken Roberts. He has made his millions selling garbage like this book, not from trading. REAL successful traders are too busy making money, and keeping their secrets to success...a secret!"
4,Smells great,Smells great and I love the sound of the crackles. I would buy more of these again in the future. They make great gifts too.
3,More garage than church,"Three masters, jamming loosely on a throwaway recording destined for the cutout bin. Fans of Pops Staples may be disappointed because the feel is more garage than church. Pops does get a chance to stroll through a casual version of John Lee Hooker's ""Tupelo,"" sermonizing in much the same way as on his ""Miss Cocaine"" from Peace to the Neighborhood. Mostly Pops is in the background, playing shimmering tremolo backup guitar for Cropper and King solos. The overall recording sounds dated rather than timeless, but with some of the production credits by Isaac Hayes and Booker T. Jones, and some classic horn arrangements (as on ""Don't Turn Your Heater Down""), it's of archival interest to the serious collector of Memphis Soul. Nice café background music, with some nice grooves and shining moments, but nothing that really sticks with you."
5,Remastered Masterpiece!,"If you are like me, you sometimes wonder whether it's worth it to spend a couple of extra dollars to obtain a ""remastered"" CD, especially when the original version is still available. In this instance, I purchased the regular version of this CD and was so impressed with the performance of these three individuals that I gave in to the urge to also purchase this 24 BIT remastered for comparison purposes. The first thing that is noticeable is the improved quality of the bass and vocals on all songs. This is especially noticeable on the disc's opener, ""What'd I Say"" where, on the original, the bass and vocals sound as though they are miles away from the other performers. In fact, the bass is now so prominent on this particular track, that some may find it just a little too much. Overall, the improved sound quality merits the extra couple of bucks and the 24 BIT remastering will enhance your listening experience with this particular disc."
3,Masterpiece Ruined! by Remastering the Legendary Recording,"This remaster sacrifices the essence of the music and intention of the album: three guitar legends jamming together. By boosting the bass and drums they have successfully drowned the guitars in a misguided attempt to sonically improve the rhythm. The rhythm was produced musically to support the featured guitarists, not smother their symbiotic relationship, the very relationship which is the genius of the record. The magically improvised conversation of the guitarists has been destroyed. Please do not buy the remastered CD. Steve Cropper, Pop Staples, and Albert King deserve better, purchase the original recording."
2,"Content ok, annoying ads can't be skipped","My son loves Thomas. He can operate the DVD player just fine. However, on these Thomas DVDs, there are 2-3 minutes of advertizing (Spam) for other DVDs before you can get to see the content. They can't be skipped although some players let you fast forward through them. This totally sucks. It's hard to explain to a small child that he'll have to wait. Although cheap for 3 dvds (~$25 at the time of writing), since this set only contains about 30 minutes of ""actual content"" on each disc, I find that I have paid in full and shouldn't be forced to sit through the spam. Again, the content is fine - it's just unbelievably rude that they don't let you skip the ads."
3,Not the one he wanted,"I love Alec Baldwin but my son doesnt :(. It seems there are two (maybe more) different thomas and friends series with different narrators. The one my son loves is with Ringo Starr and is a newer version to this series with the Alec Baldwin narration. I honestly dont know how my son can tell the difference but once he started watching ""totally thomas volume 1"" he just looked at me with those ""this is not what I want"" eyes and walked away like a prince that was given the wrong crown (if you know what I mean)...:)"
5,Great collectors set,"If you're child loves Thomas like so many do, then you'll want to get this set. My son watched them over and over and over again. It's fun for parents to watch as well."
1,Disappointed,"I'm sad! My grandson loves Thomas and when these DVD's arrived, the cases were all cracked and 1 of the disc's kept freezing! Needless to say, I won't be buying anything from this seller ever again!"
3,What a belt! but...,still too big for us thinnys. Not all carpenters and trades are pie munchers you know!Also the narrow buckle band should go all the way round and just attach at the back so you can thread on pouches just to that rather than onto the big padded belt.I suppose Custom Leathercraft/Kunys are trying to limit customers to just their pouch system. Would go for something simpler I think in future.Quality of materials and manufacture +++++Quality of design ++---
5,"Royal Philharmonic ""Rocks"" the Beatles","I absolutely ADORE this CD!! I had another copy of this CD which was lost, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon. The music arrangement is amazing and, after all, it's THE BEATLES!"
1,Fell asleep during the first chapter,"I asked for a book on Scottish history for x-mas and this is what I get! Im trudging through the first couple of pages and I have the urge to grab a pencil and rewrite stuff. I dont usually get that urge when reading books. After that, I decided to look at the author's credentials to see if it was even worth reading. Apparently its his first book, he works for some nobleman in the UK somewhere. Scotland deserves better than this book. The only thing I gleaned(sp?) off this book was that this author thinks Scotland is the greatest place on Earth. Avoid this book. Based on the book I'd add: Avoid the ""A Traveler's History of"" series. Buy a ""short history"" if you can find one."
1,High maitenance filter,I have used this filter for over 3 years. During that time I have had to replace almost every part in the system. It never would prime correctly and had to be cleaned almost every week due to decreased flow rate. After the handle broke last week I went out and bought a Rena XP2 filter. I have never seen my tank as clean as it is now. The XP2 was also almost $30 cheaper than the EHEIM.
1,"Great at first, but ended up being a dud","I bought this after my previous Eheim filter began losing significant pressure after about 4 years. I was very happy with it, so got this one, which is the newer model of what I had before. It worked great for about 2 months, then began losing pressure. Now, at less than 3 months, it's as bad as my other one was at 4 years. Is the this the new improved model? Not impressed. And not happy with blowing $120!"
5,One of the best albums I've ever had,"I'm in love with two tracks: ""a few lines written by hand"" and ""since"". the second one makes me cry every time I listen to. Try [...] and [...] :)"
1,Blah blah blah. . . .,"Well, having met and been fortunate enough to drop one of Daryl Moen's classes in the past, I can safely say that this book cements his status as a classic example of ""those who 'teach' because they can't 'do'."" (Oh, sorry, was that sentence a bit too ""cluttered""?)"
5,wonderful!,I love this book. The photos are great! It has quickly become one of my daughter's favorites!
4,Cool looking shoes,"These are really good looking casual shoes. They even came with an extra set of laces ... One pair of white and one pair of gray. I haven't yet worn them for long periods but they seem comfortable. Not as supportive as my saucony running shoes, but I didn't expect them to be. My only complaint is that the heel seems a little bit shallow, in the sense that my heel feels like it wants to slip a bit when I walk, despite the overall size of the shoe being right. This is minor though. Good look and good feel for a good price."
3,saucony jazz,i had these shoes years ago and remember them having more cushion they seemed more firm. They serve a purpose but they are not the same as store bought.....
5,Saucony Jazz,These are my favorite shoes. I will be so sad if they ever stop making them. They are the most comfortable for walking or for casual.
2,Could be improved,"First of all, I'm Mary Graham, not Jessica Shoemaker. I'd really like these shoes if the white part were black. Please make some of those shoes, all black, the way you used to."
4,Awesome sneakers!,"I love Saucony... I don't know why I bought a different brand for my previous pair. I just got these in the mail today and they are so comfortable. When I was on the subway to work today, I was wondering when my shoes would arrive. I looked at this stylish girl sitting across from me and she was wearing the EXACT style I just bought. Damn!"
5,old favorites :),"I've had several pairs of these sneakers over the years. They are so comfy, affordable, and I see no reason to ever switch to a different shoe."
5,Superb disc. Incredible performance of the Liszt Sonata,"I have many recordings of the Liszt Sonata and have heard it numerous times in recital. This includes performances by Richter, Argerich,Horowitz, and early Brendel as well as many others. It is rare that the pianist can easily meet the technical challenges of the piece and also display the great beauty of this sonata. This performances displays both great technical ability and great beauty. Excellent recorded sound. Beautiful highly emotional music. Please do not miss it."
4,Good taste,Little game taste but overall a very satisfying piece of meat. I would recommend to anyone looking for a different jerky
1,Disappointing cartoon style book,"I expected more detailed, better drawn images than what the book contained. Coarse grained paper is used for the pages & the overall quality of the project is poor. Several short episodes of Victorian murder are presented in black & white line drawings with little detail. Nothing unusual or particularly interesting in the telling or presentation."
4,Intriguing story,"Very interesting story that first caught my attention on the Mysteries at the Museum television show. I was a bit disappointed to discover that this book is really a graphic novel or whatnot, but it was still informative and held my attention."
1,Pathetic,"Great nozzle if you plan on using it for a few days, because after that it renders itself USELESS!!"
4,One man's emotions reveal a lot about retirement,This book is a soft approach to facing the emotional side of ending one's working life and becoming retired. I found it useful even many years ahead of retirement. The author's diary style and his description of very mundane conversations and small incidents and how he felt about it makes for a very credible revealing of how this life transition may go for others.
1,"""Taking Retirement: Get On With It!""","I wanted to like this book very much, but after the first 50 pages I began to identify with the author's wife who encouraged him to quit ruminating on the loss of his title, his students, his office, etc. He visits friends and relatives in nursing homes to make himself even more melancholy about the future, frets over the variables of his investments and gives his co-workers a hard time over having a party to commemorate his career. I was hoping this would be a helpful ""How To"", but I found it to be a definite ""How Not To""."
3,woodsball / scenario player who always bangs into rocks and ground,"Only used these knee/shin pads once so far. Wish they did not need to be ""pulled"" over the leg. The velcro straps are good but you still need to pull these over your leg or THIN pants under your camos or regular pants. I guess they are expensive cause of the name brand- which seems to be importamt for speedball players ;)? Bought mine with the 30.00 off with amazon card so 12.00 is not bad. Another strange item would be the ""bag"" it comes in has a cardboard top and if you pull this off you ruin the bag that is suppose to be used to transport the pads- bad design on that. They should have connected the cardboard to a thick plastic piece in order to avoid this. Since I have not used other pads I cant compare but the price tag is steep so look around first and see what is best for you.Aj"
3,Not what I was looking for.,I had been told this was the only version of Big Bruce. It is not the one I wanted. Good if you like bluegrass banjo picking songs.
2,The Early rebel Recordins: 1962-1971,Really enjoying these songs on CD. Nice listening to Older recordings. Would Highly recommend this album for other people
4,Good book.,"Good review of the negative aspects of SSRIs (and there are many). Would have given it five stars, but he leaves out the very important fact that SSRIs can sometimes cause permanent sexual dysfunction after the drugs are stopped. This has long been overlooked by the medical community and should be included here. Do a goolge search for details."
2,Not what I expected.,I ordered this book without knowing it was an anti-anti-depressant book. I was looking for a book with more knowledge about living on anti-depressants. This book bashes medication too much for my tastes.
3,Naive,"I always try to consider different opinions while we're speaking of depression and other mental disorders. Nonetheless I must say M.D.Breggin's consideration of depression is pretty naive nowdays and in this society. Probably he'd never been depressed in his life. He talks of depression like a ""gift"" given to us for overcoming our's own life difficulties. Something we have to pass by only with our willn (but he doesn't consider that will is right the thing that depressed people miss). Other thumb down in my opinion is the fact that the author tends a little bit too much to attack pharmaceuticals and everything is chemical. Nothing's new here in Europe (where everything's not natural is considered dangerous) but I hoped at least in the US in a more objective and non-passionable point of view."
1,Dangerous misconceptions,"This is an irresponsible book in the gravest extreme. All medications have down sides and side effects. Celexa gave me my life back, and it is greatly disturbing to me that many people who need medical help beyond ""talk therapy"" will be discouraged from seeking it through fear and panic spread by Breggin. My doctor was not pro-pharmaceutical, he was desperatly searching for a med that would get me out of my bed and let me resume my life. Depression is a biochemical disorder, which has been proved beyond any doubt. For a chemical disorder, you need medicine, period. The same way a cancer patient needs meds. Just like the cancer patient hasn't a prayer without meds, neither do the clinically depressed. It is a DISEASE...GET IT!!!"
2,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I should have heeded the warnings of reviews on previous versions of this movie. Or maybe I just had too high of expectations for this compilation. Whatever the reason was, I felt a little ""let down"" when i finally viewed this DVD. I have been wanting to see one of these movies for about 15 years now since they started the tour. I was intrigued by the name ""sick and twisted animation"" Well maybe if I was still in my 20's this may have been a bit more interesting. But as an ""official grown-up"" now it wasn't. I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster. One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats. If you like a guy named Bill Plympton, then maybe you will like this as several of the sketches are from him, otherwise I have to give this a big thuymbs down."
4,Fun and smart,"Rosie can time travel, This time she goes back to 1943 and Ireland in the ""Emergency"" to help an old friend facing a murder charge.I really liked this book: it handles the different values of 1943 and 2000 very well, the difficulty Rosie has talking to someone she once new as a boy and the ways in which Ireland conducted itself in WWII come over very well. Best is the really strong flavour of urban Ireland.And finally, Rosie is a lot of fun. Smart, conniving, ingenious."
5,Wonderful for teachers & homeschoolers,"I decided to teach my children art (ages 5 & 7) during their X-mas break. This book served as the curriculum. It was excellent. I xeroxed the exercises (as instructed in the book), my kids were focused during the lessons. After a total of 6 hours of instruction... they are very good drawers. They have developed their spatial awareness, which was my aim. ""Drawing with Children"" and its 8 basic shapes methodology is excellent for anyone who wants to teach or learn art in a school or home environment. Especially if the teacher is not a practicing artist."
5,"Drawing With Children: A Creative Method for Adult Beginners, Too",I love this book. I'm the furthest person from being an artist that I can think of but loved drawing as a child. I like to diddle through the exercises and love the freedom the author gives me to not have my art look like everyone else's. It takes a lot to convince a person like me that art is an expression of self and doesn't need to mimic the rules of society for good art or great art. I now enjoy creating my own art again:-) I also have grandchildren now and want to instill a love of creation that won't die with adulthood. I believe art is an important expression of self that should never be abandoned.
5,Drawing with Children,I found this book to be a big help with teaching art. It gives wonderful ideas and explains why. It is a big help in adding to the curriculum.
5,How to teach this,"I read through this book, as suggested by the author, to familiarize myself with it first before attempting to teach it to my home schooled children. I was very excited, but was at a loss, as this book does not give step by step instructions, on how to teach it.It is a great book in regards to theory, but is a bit disorganized unless you have perhaps taken the monart lessons at her school.So I sat down and attempted to write out lessons, which was frustrating and time consuming. So I decided to google it. I found this great site and wanted to share it with you all if you want to use this book and are confused in how to present the material. I am glad to say, I was on the right track, and most of what I had already prepared (after several hours of flipping from page to page!!) goes along with this comprehensive lesson plan done for you!Yay![...]Hope it saves you time, as it did me!!Blessings."
3,a little too advanced for younger ages...,"I bought this book on the advice that it was appropriate for younger children, but after reading it I am convinced that it will be several years before it is appropriate for my son. It seems to be more a ""theory"" book than a how-to manual which is what I was led to expect."
2,waste of time,I wish that I had not purchased this book. The entire book could have been summed up in a chapter. It was very repetitive and filled with examples of children's drawings. Including a few drawings as examples would have been fine but they seemed to be used as filler. I did not find it very helpful in teaching me or my children how to draw.
4,Drawing Novice,I am excited to start this book with my 5 year old. She loves to draw. I can't wait to see if the book's suggestions actually work...
4,suspenseful and chilling,"This was an exciting book to read. If you are into undercover ops type stories I would recommend this one. I looked forward to picking up and continuing the story every chance I could until finishing it. If you are interested (for whatever morbid reason) in the motorcycle gang subculture, don't miss this one."
2,disappointing,"I was expecting alot more actual stories; instead, kept hearing about how brutal they were and all the criminal activities.Seemed like a second hand report on supposed criminal activities. Maybe, being a long time biker made it seem intended for the nonbiker to further their disdain for bikers in general.I found it to be very tame compared with other books of the same genre.Try being friendly to an OTW, for a couple of beers you can learn alot more activities."
5,I didn't want to put the book down,"I consider William Queen to be a true American hero. He's the new gold standard by which all undercover police officers will be judged. Infiltrating the Mongols required an incredible amount of courage and personal sacrifice. William Queen put his life on the line every single day for two and a half years. The story will draw you in and will have you reading page after page to find out what happens next. I opened the book one evening just to read the first few pages so I could get a feel for the story. A few hours later when I finished the book I actually said out loud to myself, ""Wow"". You won't be disappointed with this book."
3,"Interesting story, poorly written","The author is a brave man, no doubt, and the subject matter is a good one, a view into a side of life most of us will never see. Unfortunately the writing wasn't very good, many tired cliches and lame metaphors made this a clunky book to read."
4,Not bad! Kept me on the edge of my seat.,"Not a bad written book, considering it was written by a cop. This guy's got guts, I'll give him that! He should read about some Customs agents in another book I just read ""U.S. CUSTOMS, BADGE OF DISHONOR."" Both of these books give me a sound respect for cops."
2,Men Behaving Badly,"This slim volume was too Ramboesque by half, and it wasn't long before all the overtly macho bearhug-my-beer-buddies posturing made me feel like I was trapped in a Chuck Norris film. Stick to those ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" reruns instead...."
1,Self serving hype,"The author owes his kids an apology for the double standard he imposed on the rational for accusing his ""new friends"" of abusing their children while abandoning his own for the two years he was involved in this project. This book is filled with contradictions and not for one second do I believe the author didn't do drugs or screw around. You wonder what the cost effectivness multiplied by the number of these small projects that get approved around the country cost the taxpayers. I hope that this book gets made into a movie so he can afford all the therapy and rehab this is going to cost his family. Waste of time."
1,Don't waste your time or money,I'll keep it short.........just a bunch of self serving crap. The only thing that truly gets infiltrated is your pocketbook.
5,Fast read,"If you are planning a trip, or want a fast and great read, pick it up. Started the book in the airport, and finished before my plane landed."
5,Great Book,"Great Book i read the entire thing in one sitting, I have to give probs to William Queen not all cops can do undercover work."
4,Unbelievable sacrifice for no reward,"William Queen had true guts, infiltrating the Mongols, putting not just his life on hold for the rest of his life, as a result of a 20 month undercover operation. For what, so a couple of Mongols get jail time.The undercover operation, and subsequent court cases were longer than the sentences handed down. Red Dog has served his time and is a free man, Queen is still hiding, always under an ever threatning death sentence.And has the culture in the Mongols changed, doubt it. Maybe William Queen ""Billy St John"" made the wrong choice in the end, the Mongols were his brothers and ""loved"" him in times of grief, the Feds couldnt care less.Readers of this book will form their own conclusions but I think ""Billy St John"" probably regrets his chosen course."
2,wannabe?,"Its a few years since i read this,but I cannot help thinking that most ""infiltraters"" have a deep desire to become part of what what they are infiltrating. Queen is now obviously a ""marked man"" for life, no job can be worth that, - and for what? True, he put some of the guys behind bars, but The Mongols are still going strong. Would he do the same again? Somehow i doubt it."
4,Great Read,Very easy reading book seems to give the reader a pretty good taste of the current MC world.
5,Under cover,I loved this book and recomend it to all my friends. It shows a clasic struggle between good and evil and how at times it can be hard to tell which is which. Shows both sides to being a member of a MC in that the brother hood is awsome but it also shows you the illegal side of things and how evil the people in the Club can be.
5,Billy Queen,"This is a great book even if your not into MC's. The book is a wild ride and very hard to put down for any length of time. What he did and how he did it make for a great story, as seen on the tv show Gangland.The book is better"
3,"Ok read, predictable storyline","Guess I should seek a shrink for counsel as I find myself fascinated with the Outlaw MC gang lifestyle.Hard to believe something like it can exist in today's high tech world with dominating anti crime forces.Pretend you're a biker, get in the gang, rat em' all out and come out alive. Predictable reading at best. Interesting story but didn't keep me on the edge of my seat by any means."
5,Very enjoyable.,I enjoyed this book more than anything I've read in a long time. Most enjoyable book I've read since Shadow Divers.
5,Awesome book,"This was a great read. I do not read as much as I use to but was fascinated with the title at an airport bookstore so I purchased it. Needless to say, I completed it roundtrip from East Coast to West Coast and the time flew by."
4,C'Mon! Is it really the WHOLE Truth?,"As one who has LIVED the LIFE for over 30 of my 53 years, I can personally testify that the OMG lifestyle description in this book is right on, good or bad, this is pretty much the way it is.My main problem with this book is that Agent Queen could really make it from Hang-around to Prospect to Patchholder Mongol in this daily environment of violence, crime, drug & alcohol abuse, and sex and maintain his ethical and moral legal criteria. The man definitely has some big stones, but are they THAT big.I personally had a few brief brushes with the Mongols & Vagos both back in the early '80's, and it sounds like things haven't changed, but I believe there's a LOT of this tale that got left out."
4,entertaining,"I found this story very entertaining. A hard book to put down! However, there are points where you have to question if there is some fiction thrown in the story or weather Queen is being completely truthful about his involvement in certain circumstances. None the less, it is a very entertaining read."
5,Great example of an outlaw life and the men of law enforcement.,"I loved this book. I just didn't want to put t down. I ride Harley Davidsons but not affilated with any gang. I have had some assocition tih patched members of variours gangs and have always been glad I never joined. This book is very realistic and the biker world. I further show the dedication, detmination, and what our law enforcement gives up to protect the citizens."
4,Well written,"I thought it was well written and very informative. It was also concise where it needed to be. I would recommend if you like this type of thing, which I do."
5,The Real Deal,"This book gives the reader a realistic look at the life of an undercover Federal Agent. The book is easy to read, yet interesting and informative. If you want to take an entertaining look at the life of an undercover cop, read this book."
3,great ride... but left me hanging,"I enjoyed reading this book and had a hard time putting it down. He does a great job of taking us with him into the OMG world, I would have prefered a diffent conclusion to the book. The ending left be hanging, however it was still worth my time to read."
4,"Great, fast read","You can easily read this in a sitting or two.William Queen does a great job, very descriptive, and extremely brave."
5,AWESOME!!,"I have never written a review before, but this book truly deserves the 5 stars I gave it. I could not put it down.Being in federal law enforcement I can tell you that William Queen went way above and beyond the call of duty.Best book I ever read!"
5,Great Reading,"This was great reading. As a law enforcement officer, I can only offer tribute to this brave ATF Agent who never lost focus of his mission. At the risk of being ""made"" he refused to abort the investigation. I highly recommend this book."
5,Couldn't put it down!,I have always been fascinated about biker gangs and this book was easily the best book I have read about undercover operations and the information about one of the worst biker gangs ever. The detail by the author made it hard for me to put it down and I am not a huge reader. I was truly riveted. I highly recommend this book over other biker gang books that I have read by far.
5,"Great storytelling, great story.","This is a book difficult to lay down. The only problem with it is that it kept me up at night, and late for work. I dont know what to believe, and I dont care. I'll recommend it to anyone anytime. Great storytelling, great story."
5,Step inside,"This is a great book that takes you along for the ride with one of the country's most violent mcs. At times you feel that you're right beside the author when he's telling the events he witnissed while riding with The Mongols. There are times when it seems he's cover is blown, then there are times when certain members of the club treat him better then teir own family members. This book is an emotional ride...the insanity,bravery and sometimes heart felt feelings of brotherly love... this book delivers."
4,Good but brief insight,"I liked the book. It was an easy read, I do wish it would have gone a little more into detail. After reading the book I wonder why the Monguls are/were considered such a violent gang. He wrote more about the posturing that was done.Over all I would recomend the book."
3,A peek...,and little more into the Mongols motorcycle club. The facts are obviously limited to what was in court. What's missing is how did he really survive for two years. Are we to believe merely delivering beer and drugs was enough to earn full patch?
4,Really a good read,"This book is easily a 5 star review save for a few minor things. It is a shame Amazon does not have 1/2 stars you can add. This is a really interesting book above an undercover agent that infiltrates and actually gets patched into the Mongols(an outlaw motorcycle gang). What makes this unique is how far into the gang he actually got, and that it involves a gang other than the Hell's Angels who have had more than there share of books written about them. This is a quick and easy read, which is good in one way, but it left me wanting for more. I think this could have been fleshed out a little more. I would have liked to hear more about how his deep undercover mission affected his kids and family. Aside from a few paragraphs, the author breezes over the subject. It is a minor quibble, but the story was so interesting, I would have loved to have more."
5,Excellent Read,"My dad is a hardcore Harley enthusiast, and former Motorcycle shop owner. He knows a lot about various OMGs from being in the business, but enjoys reading about them still. I bought this book for him several months ago, and he said it was one of the better OMG books he had read. I acquired the book several days ago, and sat down to read it. I had a hard time putting it down. William Queens infiltration of the Mongols was fascinating and exciting to read about. I really enjoyed how he didnt make these outlaws seem inhuman and unfeeling all the time. This truly was one of the best OMG books Ive read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with any interest in motorcycle gangs."
3,Like watching a R rated movie on a public network.,"Good read but I couldnt help but feel like the author left a lot of stuff out. It just seemed like everytime a dangerous situation came up, there was this very simple way out. too simply and hard to believe. Im expected to believe the atf agent never did any drugs during his 2 1/2 yrs. undercover. I recommend Hells angels into the abyss by Yves Lavigne. Its more realistic and way more interesting. I think the fact that the majority of the book has to do with a informant gave the book a deeper look into what most motorcycle gangs are like."
4,MONGOLS,I really liked this book. Mr. Queen does a great job of telling the story of how he came to become a member of the Mongols in an non-egotistical fashion.He keeps the readers interest by telling about his day to day dealings with some dangerous individuals and actually earning his patch in the club without always trying to place the spotlight on himself. It's too bad that Jay Dobyns did not read this book before he wrote his. This is a book that anyone who has an interest of learning about the Mongols will have a hard time putting down.Highly recommended reading.
2,bad music,"Watch out, there's music! I personally don't mind music in the background of nature CDs, but this music sounds kind of fake or synthetic, almost like the instruments were all played on an elecric piano. You could probably pick out a more enjoyable CD."
2,Disappointed,I usually love these CDs and I own at least six. I was hoping for something to fall asleep to. Unfortunately the music isn't relaxing. I love falling asleep to thunderstorms so I thought this CD would do it but the background music is too upbeat.
4,"great music, but gets repetitive","This CD has always been one of my favorites. I don't remember when this CD was purchased, but I didn't pay much attention to it until a few years later. During a family vacation to the Southwest in December 2000, this was the CD I had listened for most of the time on the car. Whenever I listen to this CD now, it reminds me of that trip - classical conditioning at work!Anyway, the CD basically consists of one very long track, which is about an hour long. It is mostly raining and thunder, with drums and guitars. It's very relaxing (despite the thunder) and fun to listen to.My only complaint is that it gets repetitive after a long time."
5,off da heezy fo sheezy,yo this cd is the tightest and fattest cd i have ever heard ftf has dirty south beats and ill lyrics my favorite songs are #2 # 4 #12 if your gonna buy a christian cd buy fireproof? i also recommend t-bone's the last street preacha
1,The butchering of a masterpiece,"The reason that this film lacks cohesion between the animation and live action, is that the creator did not create any of the animated segments. All of this film's animated sequences are taken directly from Mamoru Oshii's brilliant yet obscure film, Tenshi no Tamago (Angel's Egg), and justice is certainly not done to it. Many people (including myself) consider the original film to be Oshii's best work, and it is without a doubt, a masterpiece. This film degrades it by cutting parts of it together with footage (live action) of a much lower standard.I advise anyone who finds this film interesting to track down ""Tenshi no Tamago"". It is generally hard to find, but if you can get a hold of a copy (preferably an original widescreen DVD) it's well worth it - Tenshi no Tamago is certainly a film worthy of a five star rating."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading the first three Fortunes' stories, I really thought that this one was disapointing. I must have put the book down 4 or 5 times AND read books in between! The ending gave a little thrill, but I didn't like Maggie at all! She had no self-esteem or self-confidence! Dallas was a great hero, though a little too pushy for my taste. I've read other books by Jackie Merritt and thought they were great, but this one dragged on for WAY too long!"
3,Very good!,Lonely cowboy who lost his wife and son years ago sees a beautiful woman and her son. Because she's very beautiful he decides she'll be glad to warm a Fortune's bed and assaults her in her parents own home. She quickly sends him packing for insulting her. The rest of the book is about him convincing her to accept his apology and go out with him. She quickly becomes more to him than a conquest. The only thing I don't like is the constant issue of women sleeping with men not their husbands that seems to be in almost every romance book today.
5,Touching!,"When I first saw the cover of the book in my Literature class,I thought it would be some serious,weirdo novel....and I was right..it is serious but not weird!It was simply amazing.I don;t think I'ver read a book that touched me so much!It was something that provided me a lot of insight about the country of South Arica and it's problems.It made me fall in love with the country!"
3,This book was very hard for me to understand at first,"In my honors english class, I had to read this book and do a book talk on it. At first, I thought it would be very fun to read because it was easy for me to understand, but as I kept reading it, the book was boring. Now, I have to do an essay on the author's purpose and I've been going through some comments on what other people said about the book, and I saw something touching. Not knowingly, this book touched my heart all of a sudden..."
3,Slow response!,"I purchased this software for my kids 9 and 10, and while I can appreciate the attraction to this game, I must warn users to make sure you have a FAST machine! I have a dual 867 mHz G4 and the program runs so slow, it really not that fun to use. My youngest gave it about 15 minutes then lost interest. I gave it a good 45 minutes, but I too lost interest."
3,Runs slow,"I have a fairly new computer with 512 Meg of RAM. The program is so slow that my kids will not use it. I am considering upgrading my computer RAM to 1024 Meg just for this software, because I want to expose my kids to Solidworks. Any other suggestions are appreciated! john-ani@gloryworks.com."
1,Bummer,"I can't really give a good review because I ordered a small, yet received an XXL. Not doing much good for me!"
1,Not worth the cost of shipping,"Of course this book is now seriously outdated, but if you are tempted to pick it up cheap, I'd recommend against it, because it was outdated and full of useless filler even when it was published in 2003. Outdated information from previous editions was left to pile up, so this book is more of a history book than a description of the state of the art at the time. Other info belongs in other textbooks. For example, the description of how the Internet works (IP addresses and such) isn't relevant to multimedia production.There are also a bunch of sidebars that are supposed to be entertaining or deep. I found most of them to be boring and self-indulgent."
3,Interesting story plot,"I usually don't like this author's work. I was sure I would not enjoy this one, but I was wrong. Maura is willing to do anything to save her grandfather's life. Her beloved grandfather is suffering from a terrible illness. Maura does not have the money for a much needed operation that could save her father's life. A wealthy old flame enters her life and is the answer to all her prayers. She marries him, just so she can help him realize his dream of becoming a father. What Josh does not count on is actually falling in love and making this a true marriage. Not just a business venture. Nice story."
2,Compelling plot but disappointing style.,"I was surprised that this is actually my first read by Ms Craft. I confess, I own another et.al book with her, but I have not read it. Obviously, I must have seen her picture on other covers but never bought her books.I usually find this type of plot, arranged marriages, interesting reading with charming characters. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this. Ms. Craft seems to have too many other characters, who were certainly not charming and not engaging. Her main characters never develop beyond a ""lack-luster"" appeal. And I honestly almost ""lost it"" when they broke out into the FUNKY CHICKEN! [This is the part where I turn back to check out the copyright and printing dates. And it's actually the year 2000.]The best thing that I can say is that I kept reading - hoping that Maura and Josh would evolve or explode or ...something, ....anything!! It ended up being too long and very disappointing overall."
4,A Must-Read for those who want to know about Jerry Jones,"This book basically tells about Jerry from when he was growing up, through his time at high school and college, his business ventures, and his ownership of the Cowboys. A lot can be learned from Jerry whether you like him or not. Jerry is definitely a man who lives the credo ""Business is Business"".You may/may not like the way he has gone about things in life.But as a Cowboys fan, the bottom line is this: Jerry is what he is; but he wants to win. Rest assured, he will do everything he can to put a winner on the field. And when something is wrong, he will go out and fix it."
5,I love them!!!,These washcloths are very nice. They are thick and when washed the color holds. I'm very pleased with this purchase at such a great price.
3,my title for my review,"They are fine- if you need 2 washcloths, or a small purchase to help you get to 25$ so you can get free shipping- this is the purchase for you! I mean come on- they are washcloths- what can I possibly say about them? Also, they were so cheap, I thought to myself ""What the heck?"" It wasn't like it was a major purchase or something."
3,"Washcloth, not bad for the price","got it with the handtower... not bad for the price I've paid. I've washed it, and using it currently. It is soft enough for the price paid."
5,This is some of the best blues you will ever here,"Well this is just one of those records that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The guitar playing is amazing and King's voice great. If you have not heard much blues before lisen to this and you will be hooked for life. The highlight for me is the guitar palying on Down The Road I Go,and Stop Lying. I only have one question why did it take so long to bring this great musical work to the needing public. And where would we be in music with out the great John Mayall."
4,Good enough for lite duty.,Not gods gift to hard hats but easily adjustable and perfect for bump protection.Well worth the price. You can't go wrong with this.
1,What an awful book,"Outdated, declasse and so preachy/stupid. You'd be better using the internet to find out the real deal on international adoption than reading this insipid book."
2,Not really what the title promised,"While she has a lot of good information (the list of contacts at the end are great), as a Catholic-Christian, married-father adopting from Guatemala, I did not like the single-mother, pro-homosexual slant of the book. It is NOT a handbook of how to adopt internationally. It is her story of adopting a girl from China. In writing the book, she talked to a lot of people who adopted from all over the world. Their stories are spread throughout the book and add a lot to the book. Overall, I was disappointed with the book and would not recommend its purchase."
4,Fascinating. Started me on my cryptologic studies.,"Reading this book gave me my start in my self study of cryptography, its science and its history. While I will not pretend to be anywhere near an expert on the subject, I found this book very insightful. It is an easy read, and not tedious in any way. It is meant as a ""science for non-scientists"" type book, and more of a history than anything else. (I have only managed to solve the first two cryptologic challenges at the end of this book, but am diligently working on the rest in my spare time.)"
1,Encyclopedia Britannica 2000,"Good graphics--poor tech support, hard to load, locks up machines, custom version has problems."
1,Ackward implementation and poor ease of use,"What is EB afraid of? That we will print our the 40,000 pages and bind our own set for the bookshelf?They could really have a great product, but they don't seem to have their heart into the computer version. EB seems to treat this as a teaser for the print version. I hope they get this right in the future. I hope they avoid the flavor of the other CD references, and stake out a high ground of scholorship, relevance, and authoritative fact checking. They could fill a large void in education, business, and home markets with such a tool."
1,Britannica Deluxe 2000,This product is not ready for prime time though the content is great. The installation is proned to errors. The product does not follow the standard Windows interface and can not be re-sized which means you get very small text on a large screen (I assume it was ported from a Mac without regard to how it functions under Windows and it shows in many places as you try to navigate).
1,Britannica 2000 is problematic,"At first, Britannica 2000 CD worked reasonably well. However, now, it does not work at all. It hangs during application start-up. I suspect it has a problem sharing one or more DLLs with other applications, since there was an update to Britannica 1999 to resolve a similar problem. The excellent content is of NO value if you can't access it (and I can't)."
2,Extremely irritating interface,"The user interface for the Brittanica has gotten worse in every year since the first CD-ROM version was isssued. Too many bells and whistles, all of them amiguously named and idiosyncratic in operation. The current version has irritated me so much that I unistalled it and went back to using the 1997 version, which has a very simple interface using Netscape 2.0. The material the encyclopedia provides is still excellect, but it is very difficult to find what you need."
2,"Useful, but limited","I have to say that I felt let down by this book. It was recommended to me, and I picked it up with anticipation, ready to buy a copy. I was very disappointed, (as a psychotherapist specializing in recovery issues), to find that the dual diagnosis approach to recovery and mental health was mentioned exactly once, then ignored in favor of the old ""either/or"" paradigm discarded by most of us in the eighties; thus the sections on addiction and mental health are of limited use, since the interactions between the two are ignored. This book is better than nothing, but you'll have to infer your treatment plans if you let yourself be limited by its contents. Hopefully a forthcoming edition will bring it's recovery paradigm into the nineties, before they're too far behind us."
5,"the best comprehensive, univeral book on mental health","Having first discovered this remarkable book in my local suburban library whilst preparing my training course for volunteers on a 24 hour HELPLINE (for relatives and friends of those with a mental illness), I felt that this large paperback was the best book I had seen. As a social worker, I also needed up to date information and chapters with sections detailed on aspects of psychiatry, and this book was perfect. However, I have found it difficult to purchase it here. I cannot take out a permanent loan from the library, so I must buy a copy for me and also one for a friend who also works in the field! An excellent well presented text!."
5,Caring for the Mind,"This book was recommended to me by a professor and I just love it because Caring for the Mind is very comprehensive and helps me better understand and make a diagnosis. I have recommended this book to several people in the field because I thought it would be helpful. This is good for straight mental health issues.Since, I deal with addiction and co-occurring disorders I am hopeful a future edition would address this more fully. I did not find the ""blurb"" about addictions very helpful. It also appeared to be dated."
5,To appreciate the mind is everything.,"We do Family Development training (comprehensive case management) to staff at Community Action Agencies (mostly not-for-profits) providing vital human services to low-income families so they can become more self-sufficient. We certify these staff as Family Development Specialists through training and testing. Though these people are not mental health therapists, they need to understand the many different psychological and emotional issues participants of their programs are dealing with. The Hale's book Caring for the Mind provides us with a easy to understand description of of these issues that are part of the DSMIV. It's great!"
5,The Best Stories of Businesses I Know,"This book is the best ever of stories regarding businesses & items we all recognize...WD40, Life Savers, and of course, the Cadillac. It's an easy and fun read; great gift loaded with lots of obscure information to dazzle and amaze your friends. I'm sure they will appreciate EVERY detail that you share!"
2,Beginner Phone,"This phone is definitely a beginner phone. If you just want this phone simply for phone calls, then this phone is for you. But if you want a phone that has a good quality camera, takes videos, and etc. this phone is DEFINTELY not for you. This phone doesn't even have the video feature on it.Oh and the battery life absolutely sucks!The only good thing about this phone is the cool lighting features. THAT'S IT."
2,OKAY,"I've had this phone for under a year. It has some great features for sure! I really liked the pink color and I am over 30. From the begining, everyone I spoke to on the phone said they could not hear me unless I spoke loudly into the bottom of the phone which was quite annoying esspecially in public. Then one day no one could hear me at all. I tried everything including reseting the phone, nothing worked. I am now in the market for a new phone in less than a year, what a waste."
4,Pink phone actually looks Maroon color,"I like this phone since mine is a go phone which is all I need, but the color says ""pink"" but it looks more like ""maroon"" color to me, it's quite dark and I expected it to look more pink which would have been prettier I think. The phone works great though. I like it because it's not very difficult for me to use and I like simplicity."
2,pink stinks,"My mom and I both tried this phone. My husband tried it in black. All three of us had problems both sending and receiving calls. Half the time it didn't even register that we had missed a call. Other times it took us directly to voicemail without alerting that caller that they were being called. Tried Sony's recommendations--downloading updates via a usb cable sony sent, and a new charger. Tried AT&T's recommendation to ""Turn it off while you shower and then turn it back on afterwards so it can receive updates from the tower."" Nothing helped. I guess you get what you pay for--this was the free phone offered by AT&T when we set up our plan."
3,madsen at his best as usual,"this was a good video. It had Dennis Hopper in at as well. Hopper and Madsen were 2 different people from very opposite walks of life that became connected. Although it seemed a little unbelievanle at times, it is a must see for a madsen fan. I especially liked the ending. one of those movies where you thought you knew what was happening and the last 15 minutes of the movie gave the movie new meaning."
4,GREAT!,"pay no attention to 'mark twain, 'sam'. This is a great movie.....unexpected, and not the typical Dennis hopper film. I had no idea who was in this , when I saw it ."
1,a 5 letter title better described by a 4 letter word that rymes with rap,This is a bad movie. Not a good bad movie. Just a bad one. No fun no nothing. Wasted cast and waste of my time.
1,Laughably awful,All the people on this page who have given this movie a positive review must be members of the directors family. This movie was terrible.I have wasted too long thinking about it already so I can't be more specific.
5,GREAT BOOK!!,"This is a great book. It's a collection of 3 Carousels magazines No. 1 to 3. It has many short but moving stories that teaches values and virtues. Following each story is an exercise composed of several questions about it that helps a kid comprehend the story better. I got to know this book because my 5-year-old kid got several reading and written assignments on it from his kindergarten teacher. Every time he brought this book home, my 3-year-old kid would be very excited because she liked the stories in it, too. It is a good book that you can keep for very long. Younger ones love to listen to the stories and the older ones can can use it to sharpen their reading and writing skills. It seems a bit pricey; however, if you can find it at a used book store, by no means, buy it."
5,The Cat Came Back,"If you like the old time country music with all the unplugged instruments being played like they have never been played before, you will love this CD!!"
3,It was okay.,"The title sums up my feeling on the book. It wasn't their best, and I hope it was their worst. (After all - I rated it three stars.) 'Still Life with Crows' is (yes) still their best book with Pendergast."
5,Awesome book,"Another awesome book by P&C, couldn't put book down, on my way to reading a second time."
5,Reading Schedule,"Preston/Child are such marvelous writers, it's important to do them justice. You want to make sure you get the full effect of Diogenes' (dare I say it) diabolical plot.Here's how it should go. Get ""Brimstone"", ""Dance of Death"", and ""Book of the Dead"". Put them by your reading chair, but do not open them.Clear your calendar--call in sick, take vacation days, whatever you need to do. Check for sufficient provisions for several days--whatever your reading food of choice is. Make peace with your family, insure they have enough food and clean laundry to tide them over, (does not work with young children) and explain that you will be incommunicado for a while. If necessary, go shopping. Have a talk with your pets (does not work with cats) and make arrangements to have them fed and watered.Now, with a clear conscience, open ""Brimstone"". Enjoy"
5,Book of the Dead,Another hit by Preston and Child. I can't wait for the next installment of the adventures of Special Agent Pendergast.
2,Departure from Great Writing,"As a big fan of Preston/Child, I was looking forward to reading this book. I wish I had not. After savoring so many previous efforts, ""Book of the Dead"" is like reading a bad novel by an acolyte author. It is everything previous Preston/Child novels are not - predictable, formulaic and uninspired. Sure, there are occasional flashes of technical and storytelling brilliance, but they are few and far between. I suspect this gifted writing duo was pressured into writing faster than they prefer, were too busy doing other things, or have grown weary of their characters. Let's hope future books return to the suspense, subtlety and craftsmanship for which Preston/Child are rightly praised."
5,Must read,"Diabolical Diogenes outdoes himself. The book reveals the abysmal depth of his madness and despair. I would have liked to see more direct reference to Special Agent Pendergast, as I so enjoyed him in the authors' other books. Here, he is peripheral to the real drama of the story and did not appear much, and one has to really draw on memory of prior books to connect with the character. Nonetheless, it is a page turner that practically reads itself, I easily finished it in one day. On par with Brimstone and Dance of Death, but falls just a little short of Relic, which I think is the author's best thus far."
5,"Great read, kept me engrossed","I discovered Preston and Child not too long ago, and I am now in love! The Pendergast series has been my favorite...I couldn't put this last book down. Pendergast is like a modern day Sherlock. Kept me engrossed from the very beginning, the short chapters gave it a fast move, which I always love. Just wanted to keep turning those pages. Enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the characters and surroundings, colorful visuals... as good as watching a movie."
2,Complete Disappointment,The first book was incredible and the second book of the series was equally mesmerizing but this book bored me to tears. The main character was incarcerated it seemed for half the book. Way too much time was spent on the details of Egyptology. The book had some good parts but even the ending fizzled out and was not worth drudging through all of the tedious details that in my opinion only served as filler to add pages to the book. Save yourself the time and aggravation and stop after the first two books...
3,Entirely Average,"The funny thing about this book is actually the plethora of great reviews it got/is getting on this site. This book is not at all bad, but then again it's not at all good either. The problem with the book is that is basically the definition of average in a novel. It's hard to rant and rave about this book and Preston/Child if you've read other mystery/thriller/suspense books by other authors that were so much better. All in all, this book is too average to get higher than a three rating and I'd imagine it would be good for an aiport layover or a long drive, not to keep you absolutely enthralled."
3,"At minimum, a good beach read","I was somewhat let down by this one, after the other books in the series. I expected it to go out with more of a bang. Still, these authors entertain by educating readers, and they certainly do that here. I wish the characters were a bit richer and the plot a bit less rambling, but, you know, there are a lot of worse books out there (I know that's an awful endorsement of any book and I don't mean it as harshly as it sounds). I enjoyed this one, for the most part, while I was reading it; I guess it just isn't as memorable as I'd have like it to be. I'll keep reading Preston and Child's books with hopes they go back to the snappier style of their earlier stories."
1,The Book of the Trite,"This book is awful! It's 'Silence of the Lambs' meets 'Dark Shadows' meets Ann Rice's witches' series - with none of the originality of any of them. The characters are ridiculous stereotypes from soap operas and cop shows. Their names are hard enough to swallow, but their actions stretch the suspension of disbelief. Come one, ""Aloysius and Diogenes Pendergast!"" An FBI agent who lives in mansion, complete with a dungeon? Ancestors who lived on the brink of madness and genius? It's just really an awful, awful book."
2,You can skip it unless you love the series.,"Another to add to the ""never read another book by this author"" pile. Pure cliché.In their defense, this was the first of their books I read and may have missed the character development. That would not have saved the book from the cookie-cutter clichés of the modern book though."
4,Maybe the best of the series,"Although the pacing was a little slow in some parts, especially those dealing wtih Pendergast getting out of prison, all told I liked how the authors put this book together.Book of the Dead has all the usual elements in this series, fast action, interesting story and setting, and mostly likable characters. But what I liked most was that, for once, the ending was not too crazy or involving, as literary types sometimes say, deus ex machina. There were some things that were far-fetched, like Constance being able to track down Diogenes as well as she did, that were not adequately explained, but Ive come to expect that.Overall, I was satisfied with the story and enjoyed my time reading it. I was about ready to toss in the towel on this series after several ridiculous plot-twists in earlier books, but this one has brought me back to the fold. I look forward to reading more novels involving Agent Pendergast, one of the more intriguing characters in fiction."
4,Good book...,"The Book of the Dead was a good book, it was slow up until about the middle.. then it became a page turner. I hadn't read the previous two books in the trilogy, and after reading this one, which most people say is the best, i dont think i'll waste my time on them. All in all this was a good book, but not a great one."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I have been the biggest fan of of the Preston/Child novels since the first (The Relic) But I have to say this was not what I was expecting for the end of the trilogy. I did enjoy Brimstone, I felt it was alot of story backed into a good novel, with an ending that opened up the Dionesis charactor. Then Dance of Death continued the fued between the the Predergast brothers, this was a good novel. But Dance of Death lacked a few element. For one it took too long to get to the prison sequence, we were half way through the novel before anything happens, second the conclusion was summed up too quickly. I did enjoy it more that most novels, but I was not the biggest fan of this outing. I miss the novels like Riptide and Ice Limit."
4,Ok this was good,"Very clever premiss, caused me to look into the actual ""Books of the Dead"" which are simplistic yet provided the entire faith system for an ancient culture that dominates the world today. The mystery was fun to read and there were a few nice twists but as in ""The DaVinci Code"", the historical fiction far surpassed the story telling."
4,Better than Dance of Death,"I've read every Pendergast book, and Still Life with Crows is by far my favorite. So I tend to measure each book by Still Life. This book, while a lot better than the previous Dance of Death, still doesn't eclipse Still Life. However, it's good for what it is: a fairly predictable and formulaic Pendergast novel. But what's wrong with that? The formula is fun, Pendergast is an intriguing and neat character, and the expanding role of Constance Green is well worth a return trip to whatever Pendergast novel comes next."
1,Wasted my money,"Never picked up a previous one and won't pick up a later edition. I'm half way through and have no idea what's going on! Why the hero is incarcerated, why a special agent can think he can tell a warden to keep an attorney from his inmate (who isn't actually sentenced yet), or put him in danger in a prison yard, and think he can do it again -- all on the word of an agent he's never met before. There's two women who are dead or injured and I'm clueless as to why. One Prof. entering the museum at 3 in the morning -- when 2 men were attacked there the night before and one died! Its really, really stupid !!! Like a really bad B movie. Hey, I love thrillers - believe me, this is terrible!"
1,Unlistenable,"I got the 12-CD edition from my library, and found the reading by Scott Brick so awful I quit before the end of the first disk. From what I heard of it, the story is good and deserves better treatment than it get."
4,great book for Egyptology nerds,"as a real Egygptology nerd I can say that this is a great book, really interesting, considering its fiction.... I wouldnt rely on it as an educational tool, but its definitely great entertainment...."
2,Not about the Book of the Dead,While the book was fairly entertaining it barely touches on the Book of the Dead. Was the title merely a marketing ploy to appeal the those who liked the B movie The Mummy?
4,Book of the dead,I felt the first half of this book was kind of stagnant but as it progressed I realize the action was going to be at the end. It was a great read! All of the Prendergast books are! You could read it alone but I would recommend reading Brimstone and Dance of Death first.
3,Read other books by these authors first,"Same title as the Cornwell book, but entirely different story. I picked this up as a paper back at the airport before a trip and had never read these authors before. This was part of a series but I understood most of it without having the background. Set in a museum and dealing with Egyptian artifacts and murder. Good story. I would advise reading earlier books by these two before picking up this book."
3,"Predictable, The Book of the Dead","This could have been a good mystery if not for the multitude of unnecessary characters in the story, all introduced in each short chapter.Historically, it leaves something to be desired, but most unfortunately rarely delves into the science & particulars of egyptology and the reason for the title of this book. It mentions a few times, but briefly the meaning of the ancient texts. It was an easy read but could have been much more interesting with some historical facts that could have fitted nicely into this story."
5,Couldn't put it down!!!,"I bought this book on the way home from our memorial Day weekend and finished it in two days! It was just as good as Dance of Death. READ THIS BOOK!!!! While you're at it, also read WINTER HILL by Matthew Farrell. This was one of the best books I've read to date."
1,Disappointed in Preston,"I very much enjoyed Brimstone and was looking forward to completeing the series, but in light of Mr. Preston's opinion of ebook readers, specifically Kindle owners, I have decided to take my Wal-Mart attitude and MONEY and give it to some other author who appreciates me.Those Indie authors seem to be a down right inviting group.Sorry Mr. Childs if you do not share Mr. Preston's views."
2,"Amusing, but would not recommend it.",Characters not well developed. Plot(s) fragmented and difficult to follow. A long read with little payoff.
2,How can you go wrong with mummies...,"apparently it is very easy. Don't bother, this book should be marketed to young readers. It started off better than it ended, which is worst than startng off slow and building. Totaly unbelievable, unimaginitive and well, which means its pretty boring and predictable. Its a 1 1/2 stars at best. A mysterious benefactor, a magician style arch nemesis all seem over the top. I guess I should have read the first two novels in the trilogy because I don't think this novel stands by itself very well. My bad."
5,Absolutely Awesome!!!,"A fantastic conclusion to the Diogenes series (though I wouldn't be surprised if he somehow made a comeback in the next book!). As with their other novels, I didn't feel like I was reading a book, but rather that I was there seeing it all happen in front of me. The writing is fantastic, and the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat. I would really recommend that you read Brimstone and Dance of Death before you read this, otherwise much of it doesn't make sense.I highly recommend this book, along with all of the other books by these authors."
3,Beware before you read...,"Having not read the previous books, and only found out that other books should be read prior to this one, I think I missed out on a great oppirtunity for a good read. There were many parts that I thought needed more description, or background, but I am sure it was known to all who have read the books prior...knowing characters, etc.I found the main character came in and everything 'fell into place' when I was still trying to figure out ... how did that happen so quickly?Not a bad book, but not a standalone novel."
4,"Entertaining suspense, stands on own","Although I liked it and found the science behind the eventually ""Big Event"" cool, I wish I had read the 1st 2 of the trilogy first, but I got it from the library and it was not clear from the cover this was the 3rd. It managed to stand alone well enough but the Constance long-childhood thing was very unclear and hinted at annoying. If a focus was going to put on it, then it should have been flatout stated. Despite that, it was a rewarding, quick and exciting read. For a suspense novel, there were very few holes...I can't think of any except a weird statement made about Nora by her husband that seemed like something bad editing failed to catch a change in characterization. Still, a fun story great for a rainy day or beach."
3,Good but not as good as I'd hoped,"I enjoyed the book but was a little disappointed because it didn't quite live up to the build up from the previous book. The ultimate crime executed by Diogenes wasn't as diabolical as I expected and the chase at the end could have been fleshed out a lot more, with better explanations of how the pursuer tracked the pursee. Overall, though, Lincoln and Child produced another entertaining page turner."
4,Great Stanley tradition,"Great album with only a couple of minor low points. Not bad for a 2 CD set. You more than get your moneys worth... Ralph could have had a couple more musicians instead of show casing his son so much, but he is up front about it at least.If you are a Stanleys fan you will like this album.."
2,Best for very small child/toddlers - really tiny,"Bought these for my 9 year old niece for christmas and was slightly disappointed in them. They are really small. You have to have tiny ears to be able to notice that you even have them on. So, I'd only recommend them for toddlers and younger children pre-school who have pierced ears. Quality is decent sterling silver, and they are probably ok for moms to put on their toddlers because they will stay nicely due to the good screw backing. But,kids a little older who usually put their own earrings in might be disappointed and will probably have trouble putting them in themselves. They are so tiny (looks like about 1/4"") it's difficult to hold them to put them in and they will also be lost easily. Probably good for a small child who won't want to change their earrings very often and maybe keep them in, or if mom can do it for her. They might also be good for anyone with multiple piercings who want a few tiny earrings to go with their central earring."
2,Not very nice,I was disappointed in these earring. They were very small and not very detail. It was not a good purchase
1,These are not the black connectors youre looking for,For those of you looking for black connectors to replace the white connectors that come with the new 06 series of Fluval filters this is NOT the right product. The picture is wrong.
5,Works Great,Bought this to turn my Fluval filter to make it clean two tanks instead of one. Everything works great!Received my parts quick and I am happy with everything.
5,Celtic Christmas: A Windham Hill Sampler,"I had a copy of this CD in the past and I wore it out. Because I enjoyed it so much, I decided to order another copy. It's too bad that it is such a short season because I'd listen to this album from November through Easter."
2,Background Music For a Depressing Holiday,"I'm familiar with with some Celtic artists, and I have owned Windham Hill ""seasonal"" collections through the years (started buying them when they were still on vinyl). I guess you could say this is a more contemplative, cerebral album, but there is little on it that inspires me for the Christmas season. Celtic music can be uplifting and inspirational, but this album is nothing more than a collection of mournful tunes. If you think Christmas is about dirges, and depression, this album might suit you, but it has nothing to do with the spirit of Christmas or its message."
3,OK,Good for developing ideas for licks. Not a good tab booklet. U have to watch the video many times to actually get the lick.
1,Not Happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The book was old and not worth the price that I paid. Had it not been my daughter needed it for a class I would have returned it and demanded my money back. I was very disappointed in the product.
3,more influential than good,"Seminal (pun intended) blaxploitation text from the 60's & the inevitable bastard child ofRichard Wright's Native Son. Dan Freeman (get it) is hired as the CIA's token black; he is literally ""the spook who sat by the door"". However, Freeman has his own agenda and while the CIA is using him to alleviate pressure from white liberals, he's soaking up as much knowledge as he can. When he leaves the CIA and goes back to the 'hood, he brings an extensive background in the techniques and theories of armed insurrection and he leads the revolt against whitey.All of the familiar elements of blaxploitation abound: whitey's stupid, the hero possesses somehyper-magnetism which draws all women to him and earns the instant respect of all men, thetwo most hated groups are white liberals--who don't recognize the racism inherent in their ownideas and the black middle class--which has sold out.Later turned into a very bad movie"
