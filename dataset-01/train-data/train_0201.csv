3,"Great book, just not on the Kindle addition.","It is an amazing book. And if I were to rate the book I would give it 5 out of 5! But the kindle addition is absolutely unreadable and terrible. Paragraphs will end at random points and a completely different sentence will began. This makes it impossible to actually follow the thoughts, for they are broken in pieces and randomly scattered throughout. The English is very old. I do not mean old king James English, older then that. It is likened to the 1611 King James bible English. Things are not spelled phonetically correct but rather how it may sound. the word ""he"" is spelled ""hee"" and ""we"" is ""wee"" and so on.So my opinion, incredible book that I wish every Christian would read. But if you desire to read it, don't get the kindle addition.Thank you for reading."
4,George Fox,Still trying to work thru it. Alot of history and the language is sometimes hard to read. But a valuable tool to have for historical purposes.
2,Doggy Days by Borgenicht,"A pretty book, but NOT useful.I was expecting a rich resource of inventive games to engage my very active non-fetching dog. Instead, this small book is in the genre of cutsie cat books: the doggie illustrations are adorable (hence the 2 star rating), but content is largely unserious. Nothing wrong with this genre...as long as you know what you're getting.Here are some examples: Relax with Your Dog (""Curl up around your pooch, with your belly to her back"") // Watch Out the Window (""Your dog spends hours staring out the front window watching the cats, cars, and walkers stroll by. Join her, and find hours of enjoyment"") // Play ""Smurf Dog"" (paint your dog entirely blue) // Play ""Salvador Doggy"" (""dip his tail in some paint [or] tape or tie a paint brush to your dog's tail"") // Vacuum Attack (""Turn the tables on your dog and chase him around the house with your vacuum"") // Surfing (""Take Rufus out with you on your [surf] board and see how he takes to it."")."
5,Great book!,"This is a fantastic book! Greg Hatcher is the number one Blue Cross agent in Arkansas. If more people cared about customer service they would be more successful!,"
4,Outrageous Indeed.,"A friend sent me this book. I have no idea why. After reading it I can say that the ideas Mr. Hatcher illustrated are good ones. The book does not flow as well as it could, but then again it speaks from a person-to-person level. It's easy to see why he is so successful."
3,Much better than remembered,"With thirteen years of perspective, the album that derailed the Connells career has actually aged better than much of their catalog. At the time of its release, I agreed with the majority of posters here that the melodies were much weaker than previous and the harder, experimental edge didn't suit the band's strengths.While there are some absolute disasters (Mike Connell's ""Friendly Time"" in particular), ""Weird Food and Devasataion"" highlights singer Doug MacMillan's growth as a songwriter and the bands evolution past a somewhat dated ""90's college rock"" sound to one more sonically challenging. MacMillan's ""Too High"" and ""Fifth Fret"", while less catchy than previous albums' highlights, are interesting and worthwhile additions to the Connells' catalog. At the stunningly cheap prices this disc is being offered by Amazon's sellers, this record is worth a re-evalutation."
3,Grew on me.. over a LONG time,"But it only grew to 3 stars out of 5. Still, it's not nearly as bad as the latest CD, Old School Dropouts.If you're new to the Connells, I'd recommend this order: start with One Simple Word, Fun & Games, Still Life, Ring, Boylan Heights, Darker Days"
1,Avoid,"Recently, I was in the USED CD section of a music store and they had NINE copies of this. There is a good reason for that. This album is a real stinker.The Connells are a good band, and even the best of them stumble on occasion. This is not a stumble, this is a free fall. If you like the Conells as I do, avoid this one. If you are just starting out with them LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
2,take it easy,"I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could... OK, it was a disappointment after ""Ring"" but there are good things here ('Maybe', 'Any', 'Hang On','Back to Blue,' 'Pretty Rough'). But it is mediocre, and the self-indulgence of 'Friendly Time' is almost unforgiveable. But it's worth owning. Just a plea for reason amid all these hostile reviews."
2,"Big Connell fan, but.....","I just can't give this one a 3. This CD drags through. Mind you, there are a few good songs but when you first knew them from Fun and Games you begin to miss the upbeat fun of this band. Add it to your collection if you are a Connell fan. You will get in a mood to hear this. But buy all the other CDs first."
1,Totally Devoid Of Melodies,"It does not take many listens to understand just why this is easily the worst album the Connells have ever recorded. Somewhere along the line the band forgot the melodies and the hooks that made all their other album so enjoyable, and this album is a major stinker as a result. If you are new to the Connells start elsewhere. Any of their other albums are a better place to start than here, although ""Ring"" is especially good. If you already are a Connells fan there is no reason to add this to your collection, unless you are a completist, in which case you should have little problem finding this one in the used CD bins of your local store."
1,Let Down,"Having only heard One Simple Word, and being quite happy with what I heard,I was looking forward to this album being the breakthrough.Let down is all I can say that i felt.Overall the album was boring.It seems like TVT hyped this release as that Big album that we all knew the world was waiting for.And I bought it because I know the connells stand apart from most of the backwash we are forced to deal with on the corporate airwaves.I believe there is Still Life now I just need to get it.Looking forward to genuine guitar pop."
1,Synapse Services (The company that handles your subscription) SUCKS!,"Amazon, apparently, contracts out these subscription services to Synapse, Inc. I ordered Mix and Recording Magazine for my husband for XMAS on DEC.5th. We have never received EITHER magazine. When I called to inquire, I was told that it it would be 4 BUSINESS DAYS before I would be contacted by a customer service representative who could help me with my problem.I do not recommend anyone subscribe to any magazine through Amazon that is handled by Synapse,Inc. The only reason I gave them 1 star is because I the rating system would not allow me to give them ZERO."
1,"Still waiting, 3 months later",Don't bother. I payed for this 3 months ago and am still waiting. How hard can it be to initiate an automated subscription in this day and age?
1,Synapse Services - not very good service,"I ordered the subscription on October 6, 2008. As of January 6, 2009 I have received nothing. It took TWO calls to Synapse Services to get the explanation that the original order was never submitted (although they certainly charged my credit card for the subscription in October). Now it will be ANOTHER 4-6 weeks before the first issue will arrive.PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!"
5,"Excellent, Great Book for All Ages",My daughter is 9 months old. We were lucky to find this book at our local library. We read it and we were just laughing. My husband also listen to the story. We thought it was a really cute book. It teaches a good lesson about not crying boy when it isn't true. I plan to buy this book in the future. We let my sister-in-law read this book to her boys and they loved it too. My sister in law is a school teacher and she is going to buy this book. We really enjoyed reading this book as a family! I think every home needs this book because it teaches our children a great lesson
4,Just what I was looking for,I was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these. I have purchased this brand at Williams and Sonoma before but always in small containers. I paid the same amount here for the bulk package. I am very happy.
5,I Felt Like A Thief When I Bought These!,"What a steal! I make a lot of Gingerbread Cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6"" long - and I bag them in florist corsage bags. They look like you bought them at a fancy store. These decorations are the best and they are so cheap."
3,Joe is O.K.,"Wanted to give this 4 stars, but the Thunderbirds, etc. are so much better. Still, Joe is O.K. If you find it used for twenty dollars or so,then it's well worth it. Otherwise, you might want to check out some other Gerry Anderson shows first before buying Joe 90."
5,Love Super-Marionation!,"I first saw Joe 90 when A&E showed them many years ago. I really enjoy the complete series and love watching the story and watching how they put everything together so that you really forget the ""strings"""
4,Very creative,"I never saw this series back in the day, but was able to see Thunderbirds and Stingray regularly as a child. I figured I would give this a watch since the price was great. It is a bit more drama based than the other 2 series dealing with world espionage and their may be groups of people...(parents) that may take issue with a father using his son as a spy and implanting information into his brain but lets remember that it is fantasy and came out of a much different era. It's fun and cool to remember some of the things that were done before CGI became such a big deal."
4,"wonderfully filmed, interesting characters","The central idea that these men find they MUST push a rock over the edge of a cliff speaks volumes about human nature. The characters are also somewhat interesting but there is no great drama in their lives or the story other than finding they cannot move forward in live without pushing a rock they had never seen before over a cliff. The very lack of central drama leads the viewer to philosophical questioning and the subtle storyline does not really seek to interrupt that. I really appreciate it when a film does this, especially when filmed so beautifully."
3,"so far, very good","I've tried a few after market brands and this seems, so far, the best. I would definitely buy it again."
3,Half happy,"I ordered my husband two pair (same size) of these, as he has been wearing Carhart jeans only for years. One pair fit perfectly, but the other pair were too small in the waist. This has never happened before. He loves Carhart jeans, and they last a long time, but we will probably only buy from our local store from now on."
4,"nice fabric, nice fit",My title says it all. These jeans come in 35 inch waist and the traditional fit is really nice. Nice material too
3,These are not slim fit,"These are probably good jeans but are not ""slim fit in the seat and thigh"" as described. They are, in fact, quite loose. I am 5'9"" and 160 lbs so I am pretty average in size. I wish I hadn't washed them before I wore them or I would send them back. At least some heavier guy is going to get a good deal on 2 pair of new jeans when he visits the Goodwill store. I wasted $60."
5,The way jeans should be,"These jeans are made the way jeans should be. Brands that I used to buy just don't make the cut anymore. Thankfully, Carhart makes jeans the 'traditional' way. Quality material and no crazy stitching patterns on the backside, perfectly fitting and well constructed. Don't pass these up if you're looking for that all-purpose jean."
4,Happy,"Good quality, fit, and price. One negative thought.. Not made in the USA. I searched out Carhartt due to a brothers comment about Made in USA."
1,Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own,Not made in USA ... Not measuring the same as a pair I own. Carhartt I am deeply ashamed !!!!!!!
1,Don't buy these,"First I purchased these a few weeks ago. Nice looking heavy built jean. NOT SO! These are tapered leg which makes them fitt like skinny jeans!!! Tight at the knee, calf, and butt. These have lasted I think about 3 weeks which would equal about 3 or 4 washings. I noticed today that they are already tearing at the pocket. I am a slender guy with no butt so there should be no reason that these are tearing at the corner of the pocket from stress. They do fit a size smaller after you wash them so order a size larger in the waist! Especially since you can't return after you wash them! I would not recommend these jeans. I have 2 pair of them and I am glad I purchased the 3 other pairs in relaxed fit. They still fit a little tight around the waist after washing so I would suggest you get a size larger in those too."
2,If you love 80's hair band jeans....,"Then buy these jeans. They didn't add that they were tapered in the description. Just traditional fit. Had to cut them to fit over my work boots. Can't send them back, cuz I'm in Afghanistan."
1,Unusable jeans,Bought (3) pair of carhartt jeans from Amazon and they will not stay zipped. I emailed Carhartt to let them know and got no reply from them. These jeans are unusable and I lost $80.00 dollars.
2,Not as good as I was hoping..,just recv flat iron. not as good was i was hoping. does not feel like it gets a good grip of hair when using it. it says its highest heat setting is 400 and that should burn pretty good but my chi got to 392 and it would burn your hand.
4,good straightener for the price,I bought this for my daughter and she is very happy with it. She wanted the Chi brand but I wasn't willing to pay that much money for a straightener. This product heats up quickly and works very well.
1,Hate it,"I purchased this straightening iron as a temporary replacement for one i lost. Ive always loved TiGi hair products and thought their irons would be the same. NOT AT ALL! This doesn't tell you when its done heating up, the lights come on as soon as you hit the on switch. the different colored lights are of no help what-so ever. They are orange anything below 325 degrees and green as soon as you turn the dial to 325 all the way up to 400. the temperature dial sticks out of the side and i'm constantly hitting it and changing the temp. it ALWAYS snags my hair and breaks it. I hate it, replacing ASAP."
2,Lame!,"I got this straightener two years ago for Christmas and always thought it was just OK. It takes several minutes to heat up and even at maximum heat it can take nearly an hour to get my thick hair completely straight! I always liked the color and the way it lights up when it gets hot, but several weeks ago I turned it on and the light was burnt out. Lame! Then I noticed the straightener was gradually getting weaker and taking longer to reach maximum heat. Finally, one day when i went to turn it on, it make a strange popping noise, buzzed for a few seconds, then died. Dead! I even tried plugging it into different outlets, but it never went on again. My friend also has this product, and has only had it for about a year, and she recently told me that the light in hers blew out as well. I am now looking into getting a quality straightener, possibly from Chi or Remmington. Overall, I would NOT recommend this product."
1,PLATES PEAL,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, THE PLATES PEAL AFTER JUST A MONTH AND THAT'S NOT EVEN IF YOU USE IT EVERYDAY!"
2,not so good.,"This flat iron, makes me extremly aggravated. it will straighten amazingly, but when i get to highschool, its all gross and wavey once more. i wouldnt waste money on this one, i would go for one thats actually worth your money."
4,Good,"I didn't get mine from amazon but I do like it. It gets my hair pretty straight, and it is a lot better than the straightener that I had before. My last one was a cheap-o, ""mini"" straightener and it didn't work that great. This one does its job and also tames the frizz! My hair isn't very curly but it is frizzy, and this one keeps the frizz way down!!!"
1,Bed Head is not a good straightner,"I bought this straightner for myself. My hair has alot of body to it and this is absolutely a terrible straightner. It pulls your hair. I threw out box and cant return in, but ablosutely will not use it on my hair because it will eventually ruin hair. Terrible straightner not recomended"
4,I <3 this!,"I used to own one of these when they were close to $100. I only had it for a few weeks before it broke because the outlets in my house were burning out everything I plugged into them so I had been using cheaper, low quality, flat irons. I have naturaly curly hair, that I don't like, and I've bever owned a flat iron that COMPLETLY straightened all of my hair until this one. It's perfect. I used to have to spend at least an hour using a flat iron to straighten it and it never completely straightened. With this one it's maybe 20 minutes and my hair looks great. I love the changing light too. It feels really big in my hand when I'm using it and like it's not closing enough but otherwise this is the best one I've used."
4,Good Deal,"Surprisingly good sound from such a bargain unit. The blue led's add little to nothing to the value, though they are kind of novel. I expected them to pulse to the beat, but they just cast off their blue glow. Luckily you can switch them off seperately from the sound, so the unit is satisfactory!"
2,Cheaply made,"It is serviceable, but up close it looks and feels cheap.I would gladly have paid a little more for something better made."
4,Building your system for Prime time,"Purchased two P362's to replace my Bose acoustimassfront's. They paired up very nice with my InfinityIL-36C(center channel)that I've had for years. After replacing my old Yamaha receiver with the Onkyo TX-NR808. It allowed me to go 7.1 surround.Purchased 4 more P362's for surround & rear surround. Velodyne CT-150 sub provides the room vibrating low's. If you are looking for a good quality speaker that is rich in sound, and lighton your pocket. The Infinity Primus P362/P363 isa decision that you can't go wrong on. These speakers have great range and clearity for whatever your music preference may be. I watched Avitar in 3-D on my Panasonic TC-P50VT25 with the Infinity Primus's cranked up,..awesome experience!"
2,not bad but messy and too many quotes and misplaced pics.,"Not bad, but too many quotes from others, drawings scattered strangely, and nothing really tangible. All seemed to be written 'too hod' and many things repeated in a strange structure. Go for the book below, this author actually did merkavah mysticism instead of searching for old quotes about it, and also provides and intro to Kabbalah.Trinity of Wisdom - Truth, Philosophy & Hermetic Alchemical QabalahOverall though, not a bad introduction."
4,Essential Clapton,"I was looking for a reasonably priced Clapton hits package to put on my mp3 player. This turned out to be a winner. With ""Layla,"" ""Wonderful Tonight,"" ""Cocaine,"" and ""Lay Down Sally,"" this disc includes most of my favorites. It also includes his wonderful cover of Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door."" The only one that appears to be missing is ""Tears in Heaven."" But every song on here is a classic song, and if you are on a budget, this makes for a great start to a vast Clapton collection.P.S.: Some other reviewers are complaining that there is no Cream on this CD. That is true, but there is a seperate 20th Century Masters collection for Cream."
4,"One of the better ""20th Century Masters"" Discs","I usually despise the ""20th Century Masters"" releases, for obvious reasons. However, most of the volumes I've heard come from bands that I have more than a passing interest in. I like Eric Clapton, but but I won't go much further than these songs when it comes to collecting his work. This CD contains ""After Midnight,"" ""Layla,"" ""Cocaine,"" and ""I Shot the Sheriff,"" plus his beautiful Dylan cover, ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door."" The only song that I like that's missing is ""Tears in Heaven.""There is no Cream or Yardbirds material on this CD, but those can be found on other Clapton compilations. (As a matter of fact there is a 20th Century Masters CD devoted entirely to Cream, which I also have and like.) What's here is Clapton's solo essentials -- in other words, the basics that you hear on the radio. As I said I'm not the biggest Clapton fan in the world, so for me, this will do."
5,Great CD!,"There is no question in my mind that Eric Clapton is an amazing musician. I think he would have to be among the top ten musicians in the era of 1960-Present. In one ranking of the top guitarists of all time, he placed 4th.This album is terrific. While it is rather brief (not really geared towards long trademark guitar solos), it really shows Eric's talent and the diversity of the music he's played.I highly recommend this!"
3,It's Ok,"I still have a half jar left under the sink. It's not greasy but feels more like a lotion that is a light peach color. Well the name says root stimulator. It makes dull hair look glossy but I can't say that it stimulates anything. I thought well carrots are good but I am not sure it's doing anything. So I probably will finish it up and come to check it out later. So, it's ok."
5,Why can't we find it??,This is an excellent product that our family has used fpr many years.Our grocery tores no longer carry it an I can't find an online source.D S Buchanan
3,Enlightening,"This Lecture DVD is very informative! A must read for all who are serious about the health of their friends, family, and our fellow man!"
4,Great product for the price,"I purchased the Tassimo for my husband for Christmas. I was a little nervous about how it might actually function - but to my surprise - I fell in love with it. It is very simple to use and so far we have been pleased with it. We have tried the Coffee, Espresso, Hot Chocolate and Cappacino. NOW - if you think it is going to replace your favorite ""coffee' shop coffee - probably not - but it is really good and satisfies your craving.My two concerns about it - there is water that does leak out into the cup holder area - that you have to make sure you clean up after you make the coffee - it can be messy if you don't. The other one is the limited availability of the coffee. I have to run to either Target or Linen N Things to pick it up or order it online. Small items, but worth it. If you don't have a ton of coffee drinkers in the house like our home, this is well worth it."
4,Drinking coffee has never been so much fun,"I love my new Tassimo. I was hesitate to buy this at first, based on the ""cost per cup"". Before, I could make a whole pot of coffee for almost nothing, the Tassimo disks are approximately 40-50 cents per cup. I wasn't sure it was worth that. I usually have 1-2 cups per day and my husband drinks his coffee at work. Well, all that has changed! Since buying the Tassimo, my husband is now drinking tea, my son wants the hot chocolate or a decaf cappaccino! I bought about 10 different types of coffee and have them in a big cookie jar next to the Tassimo machine. Every morning I look forward to choosing a different coffee. I'm actually excited! I feel like it's an indulgence/treat for myself. I wouldn't care if it were $1.00 a cup! It's worth every penny."
5,Tassimo 1400,"it works as advertised, no mess to clean up just insert the disc and enjoy the coffee. this machine is idiot proof, anyone can make an excellent cup of coffee, or other beverage. the only down side would be it only produces 1 cup size. it would be nice if they could make T-disc for larger sizes."
5,I LOVE my Tassimo!,"I LOVE my Tassimo Beverage maker. I Love the convenience, the ease of making one FRESH cup of coffee each time I want it. It's neat, it's small & it makes absolutely terrific fresh coffee.....one cup at a time."
3,Where can I find only the t discs with cream/milk?,"The machine Is great, the coffee/cappuccino is too. It produces a fast and gourmet product.Minor: I cannot locate the milk/cream t-discs anywhere! Very disappointing for a high quality product."
4,"So far, so good!","I have had the machine for about a month now. I love the variety of drinks and their taste. It is easy to use and clean up is minimal so I am not sure what the comments about being messy are all about. It is a little noisy but only for a few seconds..so that is not a problem.I find it confusing whe I first hit the button, it goes into the heating cycle. I usually have to hit the button again to begin the brew cycle after it has heated. A minor glitch and it could definitely be operator error.I have had ""wand"" type cappucino machines in the past and they have usually wound up at my next garage sale because they were messy and difficult to use. For me, this one is a keeper!"
1,Buyer beware - Recalls and poor taste,"we bought our tassimo about a year ago and were relatively happy with the Starbucks brand coffee brews, but then Starbucks dropped Tassimo and there isn't even a close replacement in the Tassimo brand coffees. Now there is a recall because their T disks are exploding and burning people. Don't waste your money on this machine."
3,Pods too hard to find.,"The Tassimo is cuter than the Keurig and a little shorter, plus a couple of people at work love their machines, so I chose the Tassimo.Poor choice.1. No Pods at any supermarkets that I have found.2. Always have to use Tassimo brand pods. Keurig has a pod you can fill with your own coffee. Filter pods (for Senseo) are available everywhere.3. Just getting more hot water into the cup is a matter of split second timing. The machine is restrictive.4. No foamy head.5. The latte isn't very exciting. Starbucks has NOTHING to worry about.Tassimo is sitting in my kitchen, but I am using my old Senseo."
2,Makes fast but bitter coffee.,"After ordering this machine I couldn't wait to try it. I ordered 10 different types of beverages for it and after trying nearly all of them, I have yet to find a coffee that doesn't taste bitter. The hot chocolate was good, but so far, every coffee has been nearly undrinkable."
1,Poor Service,"I have the machine which works well, HOWEVER, T's service is terrible. They have many restrictions or rules on ordering and when you trip one, they cancel your order and they don't tell you about the cancelation. But they do send you an email confirming the order???? Because they are so slow to ship, you don't know they canceled until two or three weeks later you don't receive the order. We are constantly running out of coffee. When you enquire as to their quirky rules, they act indignant like its none of my business. It's a so what attitude. Pass- do not buy. MJH in Connecticut"
2,Not for the discriminating coffee drinker,"If you're looking for a novelty coffee machine, this is for you but it won't give you real coffee or cappucino.This machine appears to be a cheaper knock-off of the Nespresso D90 and Concept capsule machines, which make excellent coffee and espresso. It tries to go one step further with the milk pod to give you instant cappucino but falls flat.The package says it's creamer made from milk. Doesn't taste like milk and half the pod goes unused on the automatic setting. It says not to refrigerate the creamer so you can't use the leftover milk again.If you're comparing this to Starbucks (I think Peet's is better) coffee, this is worse.The positive reviews seem suspect. The reviewers have either nothing critical to say about other products they've rated or this is their first review. This is not to say that I'm working for a competitor, I just know what the better machines are."
1,this machine ceases to work after 2-3 years,I've owned two Tassimo machines. Both died after 2-3 years. One is left with a useless bulky machine sitting on the kitchen counter and lots of useless environmentally horrible little plastic coffee pods. Save your money and get a simple decent drip coffeemaker at half the price that will last many years longer.
1,Might as well brew your own,"I have the Keurig single cup at home and the Tassimo at work and there is no comparison between the two. I love the Keurig and hate the Tassimo. The Keurig is always ready to brew with no wait. The Tassimo has to warm up and heat the water first. Plus, the Tassimo rarely correctly reads the bar code on the T-discs. I've had 4 cups of coffee today and had to manually (holding down the brew button for the duration of the brewing process) make each one with the Tassimo. In short, the Keurig is a hassle-free, coffee on demand product. The Tassimo is a wait a couple a couple minutes for water to heat up, hold down the button while the cup brews product. I would not recommend the Tassimo to anyone."
3,Good machine for its purposes.,"I don't know what others expect of this product, but it does what it's supposed to do. The coffee is limited and fairly expensive, however, it's quick and easy. The cappuccinos and lattes are the best! The water container has to fit exactly right, or the coffee doesn't brew correctly and is a little difficult to put in place. As far as the noise level, I didn't find it all that loud - coffee-makers do make a certain amount of noise when brewing. I like weaker coffee, so it suits me just fine! All in all, it serves the purpose."
3,When is AUTO not AUTO,"Although this unit does not cost a lot, and it makes a good cup of coffee; it is very fustigating to use. When I purchased it I thought the automatic mode meant you turned on the unit, put in water and a T disc; and set it to auto - you went away can back and coffee was ready - not so. Auto means it reads the disc and does what the bar code tells it to do. This system is really a manual system, you ""tell"" it to heat the water, and when the water gets hot, the unit move to auto, and you push the stop start button to tell it to make the coffee. If you do not push the start/stop button within a very minutes of the system moving to auto it reverts to standby (safety feature)."
2,Drinks taste good but it generates a lot of trash,We gave this as a Christmas gift along with a variety of coffees and latte pods. The gift went over well and the recipient was really happy with it. The family jokingly fought over who got to press the button each time. All of the drinks we tried tasted good and were the appropriate temperature.The only thing that really bothered us about it was the amount of waste from the pods. I knew it was single use and expected a little bit of waste but we cringed at the amount of trash from the pods. They were large pieces of plastic packaged in a cardboard box in a plastic/metallic bag and the plastic didn't even have a recycle symbol on it.If you're constantly driving to coffee shops to pick up drinks this might make sense but I'm sticking to my french press and loose tea at home for beverages that taste just as good and generate a lot less trash.
5,Great Coffee Every Time,I really like the ease of use and the freshness of the coffee. The cappuccino and expresso are as good as in a coffee house.
2,It works but too expensive,This was a wonderful Christmas gift that someone gave. The machine works. You get a cup of hot coffee in about a minute with little mess to clean up. The bad news is the coffee is too expensive and choice is limited to what kinds of coffee and teas that can be used. So if your wealth is such that the cost doesn't matter and you like the coffee then go for it.I'm thinking of acendently knocking it off the counter and inadvertnetly kicking it hard enough to break it so I can throw the damn thing out.
1,I can't believe I bought this and they dont have Hazelnut coffee,"When I bought my Tassimo from Bed Bath and Beyond the sales rep told me I could order online Hazelnut coffee. I come to find the Tassimo has a very limited range and its of brands i never heard of. I really was looking forward to making Hazelnut cappuccinos in my home. I am returning this system and going with the system my sister just got, the FLAVIA since it not only makes cappuccinos it makes Hazelnut, French Vanilla cappuccinos. I can't believe these guys launched a system in the states without flavored coffee."
4,"good coffee, environmentally unfriendly",I do love the coffee but I wish that the disks were recyclable. There's a plastic part with a foil top that has to be thrown in the trash after each use. Out here in Oregon we hate to throw anything into the trash. Tassimo would be doing the earth a big favor if it could figure out how to make a biodegradable or recyclable disk.
4,"""Good to the last drop""","I love coffee machines...I wish I could have them all, but my latest purchase will be with me for a long time. The Braun Tassimo makes a great cup of coffee, an expresso, a latte, a cappacino and a hot chocolate...I have tried all of these bar-coded discs in this machine and I am here to attest that it works as advertised. The machine takes a little getting used to, and it is a little loud, but the result is excellent. I saw the machine advertised in an episode of Martha Stewart's ""Apprentice"". Good marketing piece. I have had the Senseo and the Tassimo wins hands down. It may cost a little more than the Senseo but the coffee is hotter, it tastes remarkedly better and there are more choices. Now, you can truly have a little bistro right in your kitchen."
3,ehhh...,"It's convenient, but not that great. Noise and vibration others complain about doesn't bother me. Coffee is not as good as from my drip coffee maker, but it's nice to have a choice of other drinks. I was really really looking forward to this machine, but overall I was a little disappointed. Kinda wish I would have bought the Keurig machine."
4,very good for a single serving,I like the opportunity to have a latte or cappucino without having to pay Starbuck's prices. The flavors are excellent. I cannot give this product 5 stars however because the coffee is sometimes dispensed erratically;the pod is not always read correctly.
5,Purchase of Tassimo,"Since I am single, Tassimo does the job. It allows me to brew one cup at a time. It also is very fast with little mess. You have no coffee pot to clean!"
1,Like hot water with a hint of flavor...,"I don't know what kind of coffee people drink but this is horrible. Anyway, I certainly didn't expect any kind of coffee house coffee, but I did expect a bit more than coffee flavored water. I returned it and happy that I did. I'd rather buy an espresso machine and a coffee machine and do it that way, than spend this much money on something that is not near worth it. If I could rate this with minus stars, I would, but I had to give it at least one star."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"I received this as a free promotional gift and although I appreciate the thought it is a terrible product. I was looking forward to it being a great coffee machine, but it's not.There are two things that make it a waste of money for those of you who may think of buying it.1. You can only buy tasteless and weak coffee to use in it.2. You can't buy the coffee in any local grocery store, only specialty kitchen stores or Amazon. This is not very convenient.I bought all the coffees that Amazon sells and along with a few friends tested them out. The only thing worth drinking was the Earl Grey Tea and the Hot Chocolate. The question you should consider, is why spend over $150 on an instant hot water machine. Use a microwave if you need it that fast.The coffee taste awful! If you are someone who drinks Pete's or Starbucks coffee on a regular basis you will not like this machine."
2,"Good coffee, slow delivery of T-Pods","I bought my Tassimo in January 2007. I like the coffee very much, especially since there are many choices. However, I very much dislike the slow and inconsistent delivery of T-Pods purchased from the Tassimo site and the indifferent customer service. I have no choice but to order T-Pods, so my overall rating is influenced by delivery.The Tassimo machine has been removed from my Christmas giving list. I would not recommend it to those who cannot buy at retail, or who would feel limited by the typical retail selection."
4,We like it a lot.,"This is a great machine. We definitely like it.However...Our first one died after 3 months. But, we contacted Braun and they replaced it free of charge. It took over a month to exchange, though, as they had to ship us a shipping box, and then we sent it back, and then they had to inspect it, and then they gave us a new one.... But, it was at no cost to us, which was very appreciated.I'm also not as crazy about the latte's and cappucino's as when we first got the machine. The novelty has worn off, and I now taste the fakeness a little bit more than in the beginning. But, they're still pretty good. The regular coffee is great, though, and super convenient.The machine can be a little finicky, sometimes, though. The programming needs to be revamped for the next generation model. It doesn't always work correctly and you sometimes have to turn it off and then back on to reset it, and then it works. A minor annoyance.But, the coffee is great! :)"
2,Disappointed,"We've had a Bruan Tassimo about a week now and I am really disappointed in the end product which is about a measly 5 ounces of lukewarm coffee. We have to zap water in the coffee cup in the m/w twice to heat the cup, empty the water, then make the coffee, add about an ounce or so of water to it and put it back in the micro wave for another zap. Hardly user friendly. Also, we have difficulty finding the coffee pods and find that the stores are usually limited to Gevaglia decaffinated or chocolate drinks. It is one of the more expensive single cup coffee systems and one should expect a better end product then this. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one. I am returning the one I have to the store tomorrow. Buyer beware!"
3,"Meh, it's okay.","Honestly, I was expecting alot more from this machine. So far I have tried two flavors, hot chocolate, and cappuccino. I'm not very impressed. The hot chocolate tasted very ""synthetic"" and artificial. In fact, the bag on the hot chocolate T-discs says, ""Artificially flavored."" I actually prefer the taste of Swiss Miss powdered hot chocolate over this, and I get marshmellows with that. The cappuccino taste was mediocre. I could get the same tasting coffee from a 30$ machine, but I wouldn't get the milk froth, and the milk froth does not really improve the flavor that much. The machine, in my opinion, is not worth $130. It should cost $99. I wouldn't be so critical about it if it didn't cost so much."
3,"Great, but has its drawbacks too","This is the most convenient coffee maker I have ever owned, but it has a few minor flaws that keep it from earning a 4 or 5 stars in my opinion.THE GOOD:* Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks* It's small* It's easy to operate* Provides ""instant coffee"" convenience* No mess, ever!THE BAD:* Big mugs don't fit well* No way to permanently adjust the strength of the coffee.* Someone always has to wait their turn.* It's noisy* Sometimes the heater light stays on and will not go to automatic, forcing me to open and close the top again. This seems like a system error. Maybe it's just mine.* Convenience costs. Starbucks translates to approx $0.77/cup, which is rediculous when you consider you can buy 1 pound of Starbucks for $10 and make dozens of cups."
1,Tassimo,After listening to Imus hype this thing for weeks I bought it for my wife's birthday. It makes great coffee but the grinding noise and vibrating water pump were just too annoying. I am returning it within the 30 day trial.My wife and I don't get up at the same time every morning and the noise was horrendous for the person trying to get an extra 30 minutes of sleep.
5,Great Machine,I have had this machine for a year now -it is simple to use and the variety of hot beverages are great For anyone who is having problems getting tea or other T discs just join the Tassimo Home delivery - You can get any kind of t-disc delivered right to your door. Now discount stores like Target sell the discs. I love the machine its quick and easy to use.
2,Should be better for the price,"The problem with the Tassimo machine is it's design and quality. The first problem is that it sounds like a jet plane taking off when it brews a cup of coffee. I wish I were exaggerating, but it is a VERY loud machine. The other major problem is that it leaks almost as much water into the drip cup as the single cup of coffee it produces. This is especially problematic if the cup you are using does not fit onto the platform. You are then forced to place the coffee mug into the drip cup with the leaking water . Ingenious design! The quality of the coffee it produces is good, but the hassle with the noise and water only allow me to give it 2 stars. There are better products on the market."
1,I hope it never breaks!,"I bought this machine in December - it broke in January - it's now March and still no machine, no refund and Tassimo always has an excuse...I've contacted them by phone and emails several times.I did love the coffee when I had the machine. But I wouldn't spend the time or money again with a Braun product.Buyer beware! No service with this company."
3,Coffee is good - Customer service get D-,"I have had two of these machines. Coffee is good as we like the single serving and fresh taste.First one lasted 1 yr 3 mo. Was asked to send back and was told 2 weeks for them to figure out what is wrong. Decided to buy another instead of not having coffee. Had this one 1 yr and breaks. Send back with above condition of 2 weeks and they will get back to us. 4 weeks go by no calls. Call customer service. No record of receiving it. Check UPS and package was sent. Call customer service for status and told they are looking into it and will call. 2 more weeks go by no call from service center. Call 5 days in a row bugging service center. Finally get call back telling us they found it can't fix and will send a machine within 2 weeks.Must be ""The checks in the mail"" as 2 weeks has come and gone.This one breaks and I'll be exploring another machine and it won't be a Tassimo."
4,Zman,"Braun Tassimo TA1200 Single-Serve Hot-Beverage SystemMakes great cappucino & latte, easily and quickly. Clean-up is simple and fast. However, finding Tassimo T-discs, other than on the web, is somewhat difficult. It's a very nice machine, and I'm enjoyng it immensely."
4,Tassimo Hot Beverage System,"This is a great little machine. Makes your hot beverage in a flash, no wasted time in switching between tea, hot chocolate, coffee, latte or cappuncino.I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't so noisy. I guess it is the pump that makes the noise. It runs such a short time, so it's not too bad. Otherwise, it's a great investment !Braun Tassimo TA 1400 Hot Beverage System"
5,I don't even drink coffee and I love it,"I used to make coffee the night before and set the timer so my husband could have coffee when he wakes up early with the kids but this beautiful machine put an end to that. I do not even drink coffee but was always stuck making it. Now all my husband has to do is put a T-disc in the machine and push the button and seconds later he has a steaming cup right there waiting for him. No waiting for the coffee maker, it is gourmet coffee on demand. We have actually saved money because he doesn't want to go to a coffee shop as often anymore since he has a variety of choices for coffee right in our living room."
2,T-Discs not a cup of tea,"I just received my tassimo today. I made 3 cappuccinos and made a complete mess with the second. I also have a Keurig K-cup machine and it wins hands down. The only thing is it does not have the ability to make espressos or cappuccinos. But it truly does not make any mess and is easier to work. I knew when the first thing I unpacked was a cleaning disc that this machine was not going to be a ""cup of tea"".As others have reported the first couple of drinks, even after running several cups with the cleaning disc, tasted very plasticy. After that, and changing to a 2 espressos to one milk ratio, they were fine.If you've never used the Keurig machine you will probably be very happy with this machine. But if you are looking for a coffee maker with a large variety of coffees, you would consider the Keurig."
2,"4 star product, BUT should have advertised as USED","The product works great, but the one I received had been previously opened(from Amazon, not another vendor from the Amazon site). The coffee capsules were all loose in the sample box. The bags had been cut open and the boxes with the capsules had also been opened. All the bags were in the box but none of the parts were in the bags. The water filter had already been cut open and used.I will just sell this one since it was on ""Sale"" and I used a gift card, the one I have that is new works great. Cleanup is simple, just run the cleaning disc before and after use(this takes one minute each time).Beware of sale, it maybe because these were all returned."
2,Not bad but not good,"This coffee maker brews a quick cup, but I do prefer the old-fashioned slow-brewed coffee with real steamed milk. That said, I will sacrifice some taste for a few extra minutes before work. I recommend this if you don't mind a slightly artificial taste.But I am really, really bothered by the amount of waste each cup produces. I much prefer the Senseo type coffee pods, which are still more expensive than regular coffee but at least I can throw the entire pod in the compost bin. I hate looking into my trashcan and seeing all those spent plastic Tassimo pods. Not for the earth-friendly crowd."
4,GREAT SINGLE SERVE BEVERAGE SYSTEM,THIS BEVERAGE SYSTEM IS MUCH EASIER TO HANDLE THAN OTHERS.THE PORTIONS ARE MEASURED OUT IN SINGLE SERVE PACKETS. NO CLEAN-UP NEEDED!!!!!
4,Love this machine,"Not much more I can add to the positive reviews. I received this machine as a Christmas 2006 present.One negative: I do find that at times I have to open the lid where I've put the t-disc and then close it again to get my machine to go into the auto mode. Other than this, I get a perfect cup every time.I have tried most all the coffees offered but my husband and I like the lattes and cappaccinos best because they are sweeter. The earl grey and green teas are also very tasty.Bed, Bath and Beyond sells a lot of the t-discs but they are more expensive than ordering from the tassimo website. For instance, for the lattes--a package at Bed, Bath and Beyond is $8.99 (for 9 cups) vs. $4.99 on the website. Target also carries some t-discs but the choices of t-discs in my area Target are limited. All in all, I haven't been to starbucks as often because, in my opinion, the cappaccinos and lattes are just as good. This was well worth the investment."
4,pretty good,"I recently purchased this product. I read the previous reviews and most were true. Its very loud! But it does make excellent cappochino and hot chocolate. I am not very found of the coffee, though. Overall the product was worth it for me!"
2,Don't waste your money!,This coffee is terrible! The pods are very expensive and there's absolutely NO AROMA. This was a completly stupid purchase on my part. Returning the item back to Amazon. Don't buy this machine.
3,opportunity missed,"The concept is ideal in simplicity and convenience. Unfortunately, every product I've been able to use with it has simply led to mediocre coffee drinks."
5,Not sure what the bad fuss is about,"After going through ALL of the reviews, and having purchased one and tried it for three nights, I'm not sure what all the bad press is about.Noisy, yes, but for what? Less than a minute.Leaks, if that's what you call steam relief yes.Lukewarm, not. Hot enough to singe the tastebuds.However, I would like to see more t discs.Maybe if I get more money, I would buy the Lavazza Espresso Point."
2,Yum! Enjoy it while it lasts.,"I bought this machine yesterday after a week of doing research. I decided to go with the Tassimo because of what people were saying about the quality of the coffee with the t-disks. Set up was incredibly easy and within a half hour of opening the box, I had a fabulous cup of latte (it took that long only because you have to soak the filter in water for 30 minutes before first use). Yes, it's a little pricy, but considering the fact that a latte is almost $4 a pop at the coffee houses, I think it's worth it. I would definitely recommend this product.*Update* This machine only lasted about a year before we started having trouble with it. The coffee didn't taste good, no matter how I changed the filter and cleaned the pieces. Then it started to spit and shut off mid brew. Everyone I know (6 other people) who had this machine had the same problems.Great while it lasted, but for the price, it didn't last long enough."
5,Fantastic despite the noise,"We purchased this 5 months ago and have loved it since day 1. I am not a coffee drinker, but my husband is. I was getting tired of always dumping out tons of coffee and cleaning the coffee machine (which I never used). A friend owned one and after some research we decided to purchase this. I am so glad that we did. It saves so much time on cleanup and gone are the days of half a pot of coffee being wasted. The machine does get a little noisy but it's really not bad. Also we find that the wait time for the water the heat up isn't long at all. Added bonus is that I can enjoy other beverages with the Tassimo. Initially we thought we'd never spend so much money on a coffee maker but we are so glad we did."
5,We love it,"I purchased the tassimo last year at this time. We had tried the One to One and it was ok for a short time. We still make a full pot in our capresso in the morning but in the evening we use the tassimo. I just got 2 of the ta1200. Our office is chipping in for one and then each person will buy and keep their preference in their desk.Ours still works the same as it did last year. I like the latte and the cappuchino. My son likes the Tazo tea, green tea, and hot chocolate. My husband loves the Maxwell House Crema and the Columbian.Target, Linens N Things and Bed Bath & Beyond have the gevalia ones. We buy the others direct from tassimo. Just leave extra time for shipping.This machine is really simple to use. Virtually no clean up. The beverages taste really good."
4,Out of date t-discs,"This machine is great, however, the coffee I purchased to use with it had an expiration date on it that was only 2 weeks from the day it arrived. No way could I have used it all. What really got me was that Amazon would not let me return it. Soooo, get the machine BUT keep away from the t-discs that go with it - at least from Amazon."
4,Great item for an office,"We use our tassimo in our office and it's great to offer our clients different choices of coffee drinks. THe only negative thing I would say about it, is that it is a little bit loud when it's brewing and also the t-disc's are kind of expensive. But the clients feel very special when they can ""order"" their specialty drink from us."
4,"Noisy, pricey disks, but makes a decent cup of coffee","I had the Tassimo for 6 months and use it pretty often, which requires purchasing the pricey disks from Amazon or Bed Bath and Beyond. The machine is very convenient and easy to use. It's a bit noisy. There are discs available from Gevalia and Starbucks, which are both great. Espresso is my favorite, the machine actually creates the foam on top.BOTTOM LINE: IT'S THE BEST ENTRY LEVEL COFFEE MACHINE FOR EVERY DAY USE THAT MAKES COFFEE THAT IS WAY BETTER THAN INSTANT BUT FAR FROM ""REAL"" COFFEE THAT WAS GROUND AND BREWED FROM SCRATCH"
4,Better than expected!,"I've now had this coffee maker 6 months and couldn't be happier. We're especially thankful to FINALLY have fresh, bistro tasting coffee, expressos and cappucinos at home without the hassle of grinding, packing, frothing and extensive cleanup! There have been absolutely NO problems with this coffeemaker. We drink cappuccino's every day! Cleanup is minor and takes just a couple of seconds. Target, Walmart and local grocery stores now carry a few of the T-discs so they ARE accessible. This coffee maker is fool proof, easy to use and worth every penny."
3,Personally liked a Keurig better!,I bought this and I bought a Platinum Keurig and I kept the Keurig. It was easier finding the K-Cups for the Keurig in retail stores and there were more flavor options and I just liked the way it looked on the counter better.
3,No Servics,"I have had this machine for a little over 2 years,just out of warrenty,.It will only make about half a cup of coffee so I tried to get it repaired.$95 to fix it and I cant buy parts so now I have to buy a new one,It wont be Tassimo."
2,"OK brewer, but for the price buy a Keurig B60","The Tassimo TA 1400 is an ok coffee machine. It makes a decent cup of coffee, and if they have your preferred coffee type, this may be a good choice for you. However, for the same price the Keurig B60 is a better buy. I use a Keurig at work and bought a Tassimo for home, figuring that it would be similar in features to the Keurig. I found the Tassimo lacking in comparison. Here's what I like about each:Tassimo:Nice looking machineWater filter is a good plusThe ability to do milk based drinks like lattesKeurig:Also nice lookingWider selection of coffeeYou can buy a filter that allows you to use your own coffeeIncludes a menu driven LCD that allows you to adjust things like temperature, auto-start time, cup size, etc. LCD also gives you status message so you know what the unit is doingThe side mounted water cannister is more convient than the rear mount of the Tassimo (strictly preferance here)"
4,Tassimo treats,"We are pleased with the Tassimo. After the initial learning curve, we find it is great on work mornings. My son enjoys the rich hot chocolate and we're still exploring all the coffees."
5,Innovative,"This is more than an automative coffee machine, it is way beyond that, it is not only brews coffee, tea and hot chocolate it makes it fun."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I bought htis coffee maker online without realizung it was available in local stores. I immediatly called thier customer service and was told they could not reverse the order (it had been seconds)but was told to refuse delivery. The item arrived at the USPS and I told the clerk to refuse delivery, which he did electronicly by scanning it in and out again. Well, 5 weeks later and Tassimo has billed my credit card twice and told me they don't have the item and will not look into tracking. They refuse to credit my account. The customer service I have found to be the worst I have ever had, very unfriendly and not helpful at all. Further more I consider thier actions as fraudulent. Great coffee maker, the very worst in customer support."
3,"Also missing the free T-Discs, seems to be common","Order one of these a few weeks back, and found no T-Discs when I checked through the packaging. I contacted Amazon, and arranged for a replacement unit to be sent out as a 'missing part' return. I got the replacement unit in yesterday, and it also did not contain samples of the tea/coffee.Fortunately I've got some time to track down some coffee and tea that I can include with this gift. I think Amazon should remove the mention of the samples being included with these units. Seems like false advertising."
2,Loud and bland,We got this as a wedding gift. It's fun to make one cup at a time and convient. Although the set up with sitting the filter for a half hour running water through the entire system and getting it set up took over 2 hours..The tea is not any better than what you can make with a tea bag at home... The coffee is ok per my brother and fiance. The machine is so loud.. It sounds like a jackhammer. We thought we had done something wrong but that's apparently how it is...
4,Excellant coffee maker,"I have read other reviews concerning malfunctioning Tassimo Systems. I have had absolutely no problems with my system. Set up was easy and the directions very understandable. This system makes a great cup of coffee. There are two reasons why I did not give it 5 stars: l. Some of the choices of the coffee T-discs only make a 4 ounce cup of coffee. So, to make a full cup you have to use two T-discs for each cup. 2. It would be great if there was an empty, reusable disc that a person could fill with their own favorite coffee. I love my machine and look forward to my morning cup of coffee. The machine is a bit noisy when brewing but after the first day it becomes unnoticeable."
4,Quick and easy for everyone to use.,"I love this coffee machine because its everything rolled into one. My husband can make himself a cup of coffee in less then a minute to go to work,then I can enjoy a great tasting hot chocolate myself. Its makes tea and other things too. I love it for one reason only its so easy to use and no messy clean ups.If you want a greast cup of coffee without all the fuss this machine is pricey but in the long run its worth it."
5,HOT - EASY - & GOOD,"I have found the Tassimo to be very easy to use. The machine works extremely fast. Your beverage will be finished in less than one minute and will be ready to start the next one immediately. The beverages are surprisingly hot and of high quality. We love the cappuccino!! The capuccino ends up costing about a dollar per serving and is very well worth it when you consider what you would pay getting one at Starbucks.The disks are available by mail order through www.Tassimo.com or Linens's & Things, Bed Bath & Beyond etc. It also comes with a two year warranty and when you register your machine, they will send you two full size packages of your choice of beverage.I have never written a review of any product, but since this is new to USA, I thought I would add my two cents. I would highly recommend this for those who want variety and/or one cup at a time."
5,Tassimo 1400,"Easy to use, easy to clean, makes superb coffee/cappuccino/etc. The only problem I've encountered is finding stores that can keep the pods in stock, as they sell out VERY quickly."
5,A Change of pace,"I really love this CD. espicially the pop remakes. So often Jazz musicians feel the need to place over used standards on their recordings. Prince's Rasberry beret Offer the listener a new take on a pop clssic. Chris Foreman's Organ playing brings comparisons to the classic organists, ala Jimmy Smith Brother Jack McDuff to name a few. i really love the playing of Bobby Broom. A truly gifted and sophisticated player. The CD is Awesome."
3,"""Charo"" showing you how to do the Macarena in easy steps.","Shot in South Beach, Florida, this video shows how anyone can learn how to do the popular ""Macarena"" dance. From kids, to the Florida marlins, she teaches the dance in her own inimitable way. A great way to learn in the comfort of your own living room."
4,A lot of great climbing,"First ascent is a film that shows a lot of great climbing. From Dean Potters FA of The Tombstone in Utah to DWS in Thailand and a gripping account of the Cobra Crack's first ascent (8c+). I must also say that a few scenes in the film are a waste of time and are probably included in an attempt to add humour (i.e. ""Human Ape"", an idea to sell a urban climbing concept to Hollywood). In contrast a few other recent climbing films, First Ascent appears ""homemade"" in the sense that sometimes the director cheers for the climbers and comments on the climbing. This does no diminish the quality of the film, rather it makes it more real as if it's just a bunch of friends out climbing together. All in all I recommend this movie - the Cobra Crack account alone is worth the film in it self."
4,"Dark, but Clever, Aphorisms","Stanislaw Lec's collected thoughts (at least in this translation) are frequently clever and memorable. They also tend to be dark, understandable given the author's life experiences - he was, for instance, imprisoned in a WWII German concentration camp.Introduction to books are very often forgettable. Not so in this case. Clifton Fadiman's introduction is superb. His analysis and musings on aphorisms make one of the best essays I've ever read.I have one small quibble with the translation. A number of aphorisms quote latin texts and it would have been nice if these had also been translated, perhaps in a footnote."
2,Hard book to get into,"I found this book very hard to read. I had to force myself to read the book. It had a good story line, but it moved way too slow to keep my interest."
5,Love it!,"This is delicate and beautiful cake topper...It has an off white color, and it was perfect for our two tier cake. Best of all, we can now display it in our living room, and it looks just as beautiful as it did on the wedding day. You can't go wrong with it, if you are trying to convey simple and elegant in your wedding."
5,frauen,"An excellant companion to Men at arms 254 Wehrmacht Auxiliary Forces, as well as both Men at arms 357 World war II allied Women's services and Men at arms 370 World War II allied Nursing services.In my previous readings in other books, I did not know The NS Frauenschaft had a Uniform, other than their triangular badge. I guess you learn something every day.Pretty good for 48 pages, however BDM does not stand for League of German Maidens, it stands for League of German Girls. Madchen is maiden, Madel is girl. Family values and stuff like that were not the Nazi way for society."
2,Stop it already!!,"After Better Days, it's all been downhill with these posthumous releases. They are obviously running out of material that Pac left behind. Plus, I hate seeing him get put on tracks with rappers he never knew or liked when he was living.And finally, these corny a$$ new school beats don't mix with Tupac's style."
4,If 2Pac was alive would he sound like this?,I am a huge 2Pac fan and have all of his albums his latest posthumous album isn't bad i mean its still 2pac. But i dont think he would rap with t.i. i understand that his songs might be dated and needed a reboot. But they should have put the game or dr. dre on the album. More west coast artist. Although snoop is on the album its not enough comparing that half of the artist on the album are southern artist. But this is still a great album the production although is not original beats from the orignal song it is still good production and you also have bone thugs n harmony which is one of the album's highlights. Regardless if you are a 2pac fan you are getting this album anyway and i guarantee that there isn't that you can really dissapointed.
2,Please let this be the last one,When an artist decides not to release a track its usually for good reason. Adding artist that were around 12 (TI and Ashanti) when he died does not make the track better. Overall the song is ok at best. I have to say this album is not worth of gracing Pac's name. IMO after Makaveli the albums just kept getting worse and this album falls right in line.
2,Man oh Man,"I 1st heard the single Pac's Life on the radio. Actually, I only heard part of the song.When Ashanti is singing the hook ""Pac's Life"". Then I discovered the song featured T.I.. I have nothing against these current hip-hop stars, BUT WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT PAC'S LIFE? They have no understanding or comprehension what THUG LIFE is or means. Dont get it twisted, i am a huge pac fan and believe he is the illest MC to bless to mic. But this album just does not do justice for how lyrically skilled 2pac was. If you want to buy a pac CD, make sure its no more recent than Loyal 2 Tha Game. Thank you and i know all the real pac fans feel me out there."
2,Just to let ya'll know,"The only original on this album is ""Soon as I get home"" thats why it sounds so good. It was done when he was still alive. Will they please keep it original and let Jonny J do the production work?? The man that did tons of tracks with pac, who pac personally worked with?? Who when they made music it was like marriage in compliments. That was the best combination in music history I have to say."
1,pac is rolling in his grave,"this is the worst pac record to date,i thought the last one was.i just wish you would leave his music alone,cause it doesnt look like its going to get better.i thought i would never say this but i hope theres never a pac record to get released again,lets face it rap mucic is dead,once it went commercial.makaveli r.i.p."
5,Like he never left...,FINALLY!!!!! they have done justice in memory of Tupac. This album is complete. I think Pac would be proud himself. The list of featured artist are superb. I was hoping to hear some tracks produced by Dr. Dre but maybe on the next album. Afeni make it happen. Go out and buy this album you won't be disappointed.
1,horrible,This isnt raw like regular 2pac I think that afeni should stop degrading her son and keep putting out pac's real stuff.
3,Tupac fades slowly,"I orderd this item about a month ago.I'm a big tupac fan.But this time I have to say that they're running out of recordings.The past albums had enough of tupac's voice in'em, this album has only 13 songs (but 2 remixes, which make it 11 songs), and tupac only has one verse in most of them.The beats are not more then nice, except song number 11.But damn... tupac is fading away....I hate the fact that they had 3 double albums out after he died, we need to save his voice for ever, so please do it slowly and don't jump out with 3 double albums.Anyway, I don't think they have more of tupac's recordings left... 2 bad."
2,Pac's Life? or Lil Jon's?,"I realize Lil John does not provide any production on this album, but he might as well have. What is up with these disgusting Snyth club joints? Pac's rolling in his grave listening to this bull. Again, I agree the bootleg versions are far superior. You want something to sound like Pac, then you need to have a funky groove, and some soul. Earlier posthumous albums understood that. Especially Better Dayz, R U Still Down,and Still I Rise. This CD is a travesty to this man's legacy."
1,Never leave a 1-star but heres a warning,If Your Thinking of Getting Into 2Pac Or at least think of buying this I dont think you should beacause It's A horrible Example Of Him. Sounds Almost 100% Unlike Any Of The Rest Of His Great Work. Sort-of a cookie cutter remake or pop version of his usually serious deep message.
3,I ain't mad at u Pac,"This is definitely a different album compared to the others but I don't imagine that Pac would of picked this kind of production for one of his albums. Some of the beats just kill the mood on Tupacs voice, it doesn't hype you up like it would normally do. 3-4 songs are good the rest are just not there."
2,There's a reason why these songs were unreleased...,"Pac would record extra songs to vent his frustrations and get whatever he had off his chest. He never meant for these recordings to be released as he didn't see them as his ""A"" material. His mother is continuing to explot her son's considerable name at the expense of the quality of the music. Pairing him up with ppl who aren't good enuff to tie his shoes, let alone rap w/ him is a shame and a disgrace. These albums showcase the greed of Afeni Shakur, not the talent of her son."
5,Good Album,"This album is definitely worth to keep. Every single track is wonderful. The plastic case was slightly cracked during shipment, but this happens."
3,Shouldn't be hated on so much,"Well its certainly better than that ""Loyal To The Game"" episode, though its a very mixed bag. Tracks like the lead single ""Pac's Life"" are pure garbage. However tracks like ""Dumpin"", ""Playa Cardz Right"", ""Don't Sleep"" and Soon As I Get Home (The only original on the album) are well worth listening to. Though i do hope the soundtrack for the upcoming movie coming out that Pac wrote in jail, will be the last as Pac's legacy is starting to get pretty greedy.R.I.P. Tupac Amaru Shakur"
3,2pac compilation.,"I wonder if this album can be categoriezed in 2pac albums? every song has only one verse by pac ,except 2 songs , and the other verses by poor rappers , except luda ,TI and chamilionair . The production is ok ."
1,pac's life it ain't...,"Tupac was once a modern-day folk hero, and over the years, his smother has turned him into a laughing stock. Tupac's legacy has gone from class to trash. Congrat's Afeni and Co., you've tarnished a man's life-long work in the name of the almighty dollar. What you people have done is the equivalent of taking a van gogh painting, deficating all over it, and then saying that's the way vincent would have wanted it. You all should be ashamed of yourselves."
5,Super Nova II a stellar product,This is my second chuck from Teknatool. The first is a midi scroll chuck with which I am quite happy. The supernova is beautifully made and smooth operating. I cannot detect any vibration or runout even at high speeds. The hex key operation is a nice convenience although it gives you more mechanical advantage than is safe for some woods. The product has met or exceeded all of my expectationsThe manual is more advertisment than practical instruction on the use of the product.Service from the vendor was prompt and curteous. The chuck was shipped two days after I placed the order.
5,I Really enjoy this book because It's really cool.,"Well I Hope she changed him back to human again. I Know she has the most powerful magic to do anything to change Harvey looks. I Want to know is Melissa Joan Hart is going to school & I Hope she is getting wonderful grades in with her classes that she is taking for the semester requirments. I Giving this book 5 Stars because I Really like the outfit she is wearing is really beautiful on this book cover of hers. And My Name is Jennifer White & I Really enjoy reading all these novels of these books beause she is the coolest person in this book, I really think that cat is cute. And I named my stuffed turtle after him. It's name is sailliem but I Enjoy hugging him I'm a little nervous taking about this but It's just strange to me. I Hope you have lots of luck & I Hope my dreams come true anyway. Well I Think Caroline Rhea is beautiful & skinny, like my sister It's too cool."
4,The foundation for well-being,"As a Prostate Cancer surviver, I found the information contained in this video to be helpful. ""Hin Yin"" is ancient Chinese to describe the genital area (penis, perineum and anus) but this video explores the entire body and various exercises.Especially valuable to me was the section on the PC muscles developed by Kegel excercises. The mastering of these are essential after nerve-sparing surgical removal of the protate.The general well-being and euphoria that these exercises promote are healthy for all men, even those fortunate enough to still have prostates.All men can benefit from this video - it will increase one's understanding of the other Men's Sexuality Series videos."
5,perfect,"it was perfect, saved me alot of problems with installing the carseatit was shipped quickly and arrived in good timethanks"
1,Not as Described,"This says it is an Evenflo clip from Evenflo. The one I got was sent from Hungary (NOT USA as stated). It is also silver and says ""Seat Belt Extender Pros"" on it. It is clearly not an Evenflo clip and seeing as you are supposed to use original parts with these car seats to be safe, it is not what I was looking for. The one in the photo looks like the original clip (has the burnished bronze/gold color). Mine is silver and even feels different - not the same at all and I am worried about using it now as I wanted the original EVENFLO one (which is what this product is described as in the title and the photo). I am very disappointed with the mis-representation. I wouldn't have wasted my money if I thought it was a replacement one from Europe and not the original from Evenflo in the USA."
4,3.5 Stars for Gallimaufry Introduction on Biochemistry,"I read the 2002 paperback of the 2001 book. It contains just 185 regular text pages, including 40 illustrations. It touches upon subjects such as biosynergetic engineering, supramolecular chemistry, molecular computing or, more down to earth, such topics as the workings of hormones, drugs and painkillers. In other words it's more about biochemistry than anything else. It may function as a conspectus of the subject of molecules. Yet, I find the concept or message of the book difficult to detect. At times, the choice of topics seemed logical, at other times the entire book felt arbitrary. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret having read the book. However, it gave me little more than an idea of topics I may want to read about elsewhere in-depth."
4,interesting,"this book got even someone like me, a total amateur in biology and physics interested in molecules. the material is very broad and covers a wide range of particles. I first read it as a library loan, but found it worthy of having it in my permanent collection for reference and more. It is writen in an easy to follow format even though there is nothing easy to decipher much of molecular science.thanks to the author."
2,too dry,Most readers with an interest inscience will be familiar with theground covered here. Unfortunatelythe style tends to be too often dryand flat - almost like a textbook.
5,This book is a good beginning and will OPEN your mind!,I've owned this hardcover book since the late 60'sand I will NOT part with it! It whet my appetite and set me off on an incredible journey of exploration about reincarnation and I haven't stopped since. I've re-read it every decade since! I highly recommned it as a good primer!
1,Feh!,"If this or any book sets someone on the path of enlightenment, I commend it. Personally, though, this book was almost unreadable. A play-it-safe tome of psychobabble, it is written on the level of People magazine. No wonder there are people trying to unload their used copies for $0.01!"
3,the best gift i have ever recieved,my mom gave me this for christmas and i have loved filling out the pages so that i can then pass all this information on to my girls
5,LOVE IT!,"I love, love, LOVE this Mother's Journal. It prompts you with questions to give lots of thought and love in your entries. I have one for each of my children and need to order another for the next one on it's way. I received it promptly and the order process was easy and smooth."
5,The best gets even better!,"In this revised version of an already excellent book, Deborah Kurata has skillfully fleshed out areas that were sparse in the original, and has added very useful information both on OO development and VB 5.0's new features. Ms. Kurata has an enviable ability to focus on critical development issues, explain them clearly and succinctly, and supply very practical examples. Because of this, I would argue that her GUIDS methodology, far from being a waste of time for anyone, is the only OO methodology I've seen that is presented clearly and directly enough to be immediately useful to any programmer. If you're looking for the typical rewrite of the VB manual, skip this book. If you want to finally get your money's worth out of a computer book, buy it. It's the only programming book I've ever actually enjoyed reading (and I've read a LOT of them)."
2,"Better than I could do, but...","I read this book after getting what I felt was a pretty good grasp of object oriented programming. By the time I'd gotten it 3/4 read I was completely confused. Since putting it down for a few weeks I've gotten back on track and have become proficient. I respect anyone with the gumption to write a book, but Deb has a way of confusing the simplest issue and her writing style is far from clear. On the positive side, I did glean clarification of some concepts but it was too painful. She should read Mark Warhol's book on The Art of Programming with Visual Basic - there's a writing style that works."
3,"Yes, the world is a little more complicated than simply wrap",I agree with msserf@hotmail.com : the world is a little more complicated than simply wrapping tables in classes. Here you can find some fairly good ideas but analysis are not deepened to a real world level. Databound controls and Recordset.MoveLast in a serious application?
2,For novices only...,"An extremely high-level look at the fundamentals of OO programming. The techniques illustrated are certainly not advised for the serious developer and do not reflect what Microsoft considers as best practices for n-tiered development. The world is a little more complicated than simply wrapping tables in classes and Kurata devotes very little time to discussing when and why certain techniques should be used. The variables that need to be considered when making performance, reusability, encapsulation, scalability, and abstraction decisions simply aren't covered in this book. The VB5 product ships with better docs than this book (Programmer's Guide, Getting Results, etc.). Save yourself some money and stick with them."
3,"Handy, but not durable","I got this watch a few years ago, and I loved it. It is very easy to use, and has many fantastic options. When it comes to a heart rate monitor, this is wonderful. It tests you, and gives you your own heart rate zones, shows you how many calories you burn in a workout, and even gives you a graph that plots your heart rate throughout your workout.The downfall of this watch comes when you wear it on a daily basis. After wearing the watch for about 9 months, I noticed that the rubber/plastic that most of the watch is made of, started to pull away from the face of the watch. After a few more months, there was a huge gap between the face of the watch and the surrounding area. Finally, I went swimming one day, and when I got in the water, the watch died. (It's supposed to be water-proof up to 50m.)So, like I said, if you are looking for a watch that is primarily a heart monitor, this is very nice, but not for everyday use."
4,easy to use!,This is an easy to use unit that travels well and gives all the info a weekend warrior would need with out a bunch of drama. I love the calorie burned function and the fact I can change the batteries with sending the unit away somewhere!
1,snoozer,"Basically if you like Pantera, black era Metallica and Machine Head chances are you will like this stuff. I personally don't, therefore only 1 star. I heard the song cold years ago on a metal blade sampler (Metalmeister 2 for those inclined) and liked it back then. I saw the cd was cheap so I figured I'd give it a try. That was a mistake on my part. But to you the reviewer who hasn't heard this band and might be interested, they are 4 young guys from down under who play music in the vein of the bands I mentioned above. This stuff is just too bland for me."
3,Metal thrashing madness,"This album should appeal to all ppl who like technical thrash metal. The songs are unpredictable enough and the riffs just won't stop hammering your head until you drop. The sound will blow you through the wall (eat your heart out, Colin Richardson!). Not easy to get such a powerful sound on a first record...i wonder how the Aussie lads did it.Yeah, it's not groundbreaking stuff (bands like Metallica, Slayer or Machine Head have gone this road before, and with better results) and it all starts to sound the same after the 3rd/4th song but, when it's played with such competence...who f**king cares? This is pure headbanging pleasure."
3,"Pretty good, nothing original","I feel like I've heard this album already fifty times.. although, those were a good fifty times, so i guess thats ok. They dont really break any new ground though - hey sound like Pantera, Anthrax, testament CoC, old Metallica, any other thrash band you can think of. Not bad, but totally generic."
5,Best of Surf/Indie Rock,"Along with Man or Astroman?, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet released several outstanding indie instrumental albums in the 1990s. This is their second and probably best one, and still sounds great almost 15 years later. Fans of this band should also check out 'Fresh Gasoline' by Phono-Comb."
3,"Objective, humorous, and insightful","While Miller's book is not as fascinating as the one related to Cuba that I am currently reading (Che Guevara, A Revolutionary Life--I can't put it down!), I am still shocked by the harsh criticism of some of the other reviewers. I thoroughly enjoyed Miller's objective, humorous, and insightful account of his time in Cuba, which only further fuelled my desire to visit this extraordinary country. My only complaint is that it wasn't more up-to-date. The bulk of the book takes place about 10 years ago...though it is still definitely worth the read if you are interested in Cuba."
4,Well Balanced and Honest,"This is by far the most balanced book I've read about Cuba. Basically, Tom traveled through Cuba for around 8 months and told the stories of hundreds of folks he met - with a ton of varying views. He seemed to be a pretty non-biased bystander and effectively portrayed all sides of the debate."
1,An Ugly American Abroad,"I didn't know this sort of 18th and 19th century Travel Literature was still being written today. Tom Miller travels awful far to come home with his suitcase full of frat-boy stereotypes and over determined metaphors. Cubans here are sexy, mango eating, Chevy driving caricatures. Having traveled there frequently over the last ten years, I can tell you the only subject illuminated by this book is the inability of Miller's mind to look past his own North American biases. There are excellent books about Cuba written by strangers to that country, see Cardenal's for example. There are also excellent books about Cuba written by Cubans, see for example Franqui. This book however is not worthy of the trees that died for it."
1,"A self-indulgent, disjointed dog of a book. Awful!","This book is a complete waste of money and time. The author demonstrates little (if any) literary skill. The book is completely disjointed, with little connection between paragraphs. It contains pointless accounts of virtually every boring encounter the author had. It is painful reading. In my view, the book is not worth the paper it is written on. There is very little that any traveller to Cuba will find useful and it's not worth the effort to find the few things that might be moderately helpful. I'm kicking myself that I spent even a penny on this nonsense. Don't bother!!"
4,Only minor disappointments...Overall good book,"The Book delivers almost exactly what it promises ,so I will not mention its good points .One thing I didnt like much was the lack of clear photos for the points ,inside the chambers section of the book .Although you get a rough idea on where each point is ,I had to use my older bibliography in order to pinpoint the exact location of most points .Also I find unacceptable that the authors did not give extensive information on Governing Vessel and Conception Vessel .Although they mention the points at the last section of the book where they present a sum of combinations and points ,there is no analysis of GV and CV .That was a disappointment ."
3,little encycopedia about the subject,"I didn't like the illustrations. They didn't seem too precise as far as I had previously studied the subject.the text itself is ok, but I missed some explanations of the techniques the authors proposed, because they sometimes spoke of tsukis (Japanese) and sometimes about tai chi techniques (the horse mane this and that). Damm, I went to tkd classes!"
4,One of the Baddest Artists Ever,"I've always been a Huge fan of Brian Mcknight. the Brother can write slow jams or drop a tight Mid-tempo Jam. He is so Musically Versatile. this compilation captures the many sides of His Talents. He is Songwriter,Producer, Arranger,Instrumentalist&a PowerHouse of a Vocalist. the Brother is something else. His vocal Runs along with His Piano Runs are his trademarks. this is a very Good collection that Covers his career. he is nearly two Decades deep which is a testiment to His Longevity&Musical reach. he has covered a whole lot of bases."
4,Definitive Collection,"To be upfront, yes, the album does contain a lot of Brian's materials available from his albums.But out of the 29 songs, the following 9 aren't readily available on his standard releases:I'll Take herWhenever you callDistant loverWinOver and over againOverCareless WhisperDon't lieTo youSo this compilation encapsulates songs that were featured on soundtracks, other artists' albums and bonus tracks from Brian's Japanese editions albums.The only disappointment I have with this release is that the 2 bonus tracks from the Japanese edition of Gemini (Don't lie & Sexy) were not included. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.But apart from that, this is quite a definitive collection of his popular and rare materials and is a must-have for all Brian McKnight fans!"
4,R&B tasty,"This is one of my favourite R&B male singer. The ""GOLD"" album is the best one than the his latest compilation album's ""From There To Here""."
4,"Pretty easy to mount, with a little planning","A pretty good product. Take your time mounting the first one if you order more than one like I did. I recommend figuring out the lines you want the racks to follow first, then mark the stud points along those lines. Seriously, use a chalk line to line up all the anchor brackets when mounting two racks in a row. All in all, easy to install, and sturdy enough to get a lot of miscellaneous junk off the floor in my garage."
5,Excellent,"Great product, i oredred 4. The first one was a little difficult to asssemble, after that it was a breeze. Great organizer and space saver. Highly recommend."
4,Does the job,Strong and sturdy product. I have purchase 7 units for my garage. Can't go wrong. Quality product that has solved my storage needs...
5,Love It!,"We purchased 4 of these that go across our 3-car garage. They are wonderful. All our seasonal decorations, ski equipment, and lots of other items fit great and have freed up so much space in our garage. It is also easy to get things down from the shelves. It took my husband and a friend a few hours to install but if they can do it, any one can. LOVE THESE!!"
2,sturday but a little overpriced,"While the unit appears to be well built and strong enough, may be a little overpriced for what you actually get once it's up in place. I was a little disappointed in what I could get it to hold."
2,Save your money!,"Hy loft is great if you plan on storing items of very little weight. Its also very cheesy looking if you are a man that wants a tough looking garage. I suggest Monster Rax if you want a tough sturdy rack for storage. I purchased two a week ago, and just purchased two more. No, i do not work for Monster Rax, i am just a satisfied customer who has tried others."
3,Not too bad...,"For the money, I think it's worth it...was kind of a pain putting up, but maybe that's because I'm not the best handyman in the world. LOTS of trial and error :("
4,great space saver,I bought two of these for my garage and they have been excellent space savers. I got to make use of some dead space. I'd definitely recommend this..
4,Overpriced at $70,"Just picked up four of these from Lowes, $[...] each. Decent product. Fairly easy to install. Once you have the ceiling brackets screwed in the rest is easy. Only takes one person, though two would be great. Keeps you from running up and down the ladder. I used mine for ceiling storage above my garage door. Once you see them in the box you will understand why paying more than $30 - $40 bucks is to much."
4,Good Product. Could be better.,"I was so excited that I found a product that would help create room in my garage. I purchased 5 of these units and called over a buddy to help me install them. First thing we noticed is that only ONE of the boxes had instructions in it. After reading the instructions, it was not clear that you need to measure 45"" in one direction to make sure there is enough room to install the unit. It just states you need between 28-36 inches.Next trying to install the units finding the studs was challenging but able to be accomplished. After installing all 5 of the units, they looked great. Not to mention, they can hold 250 pounds without a problem.In short, if you can figure out how to put these things up properly they are a good buy and will definitely save you space in your garage."
2,"Decent product, but I'd only use it with additional braces","I installed 2 of these over one of my garage doors (one on each side of the chain track). It took a few hours to do them but I'm happy with the result...only because I was able to use some additional brackets securing then to the same strong angle iron braces used to hold up the garage motor. Hyloft is a good product, but this design is flimsy without additional brackets."
5,Perfect storage unit,We bought this product since we only have a 2 car garage. It works great and frees up a lot of space in our garage. My husband said it was easy to install and we have actually purchased a 2nd one to install. It does what we need it to and is inexpensive compared to other products out there. If you are looking for a good storage system this is the one to get!
4,Nice storage,"Provides well needed storage space and was pretty easy to install, but I did have to do some customization for my task. It feels very solid."
1,Flimsy,"We bought the product and installed it after we had to purchase additional mounting screws. The ones supplied are not adequate. We loaded the rack with less than half of the weight capacity only to find it sags by about 2"" in the center. We were not comfortable putting anything up there at all. Looked like it would fall down."
2,Hy-Loft Review,"This is my second Hy-Loft and the first is why i bought a second one. When i picked the unit up at the post office i found the ends of the box not sealed and the unit was basically falling out of the packaging. Makes you wonder if the quality of the unit has gone down as much as the packaging. i have not installed yet, so cannot comment on the quality at this time, nor do i know if anything is missing due to the box being open."
5,"Good value, takes some time to install","The HyLoft units are composed of solid materials, come with great instructions (with videos on the web), and also look nice when finished. I purchased three of them to connect together, and they do fit together nicely with the stud layout in my garage. I don't think it would have worked as nicely if the studs in my garage ran the other direction, so you will want to check which way they run when planning your layout. The instructions restrict you from mounting more than two on any set of studs. Installation took me a lot longer than the 60 minutes suggested for each unit - I spent at least an hour just getting the brackets centered on the studs.These issues do not affect my review - I give them 5 stars since they do work great and look nice too, just be sure to plan for your layout and consider it an all day project if you are putting up multiple units."
4,Nice product for Overhead storage,Solid and stable and a good solution to overhead storage. Cost per storage space is a bit high ... however it does get unused items well out of the way of valuable floor space.Installation is a snap.Consider buying 2 or 3 and making sure you have a long high empty wall and ceiling space to fill ... such as an entire forefront of a garage. [This would give it far higher functionality for the enduser]
4,So far so good. Great idea!,Not to difficult to install if you've got a good tall ladder. You need a good stud finder if you're installing through sheetrock. Finished product is quite nice. We'll see how it holds up but right now I'd highly recommend.
5,Works as designed,The rack system is simple to install and very sturdy. The hardest part is finding the studs in the ceiling to drill into. It holds quite a lot and is a great product to solve the cluttered garage.
4,Nice Option for Extra Storage,"I purchased two of these units to use in my garage and installed them together end-to-end as a single unit. Instructions for installing them this way were vague and it was difficult to get the wire shelves to butt together so that one was not higher than the other. Needs a better way of connecting them together than with the nylon ties included. Otherwise, they are great for extra storage."
5,Great Storage!,"This is the 5th one of these I bought. I have moved a ton of stuff off the floor of my garage. Our garage is tall so I was able to create a shelf about 24"" high. I also bought the ladder accessories. Pretty easy install and can be done with 1 person like the box says."
4,HyLoft Overhead Storage,"The product is exactly as advertised. I placed four lofts in my garage. The installation is basic and the instructions are good. Bolting the mounting plates into the ceiling of the garage is the most work. If you have a 7/16"" socket adapted to a drill, it would make the mounting plates a lot easier. They even provide extra hardware incase you drop and lose something."
4,Good Storage solution,"I have a dozen of these mounted on my garage ceiling. Installation was quick, easy and can be done by one person. The first one took a bit of effort, after that it was no more than 20 minutes per shelf. A powered nut driver helps to screw the lag bolts in, tightening that many bolts overhead can be a bit tiring. Once you have located the joists its no problem. Since alignment of the brackets is not critical, they can be mounted regardless of which way your joists run.Loading and unloading items on the back of these shelves can be a bit tricky. It is not easy to slide loose items across the wire shelves. Also they do sway a bit from side to side"
5,Perfect for the garage,This is my second Hyloft overhead storage system. Filled up the first one pretty quickly and needed more storage space. This unit looks good and is easy for one person to install in a half hour or less.
5,Easy to install and function exactly as promised,Super easy to install(clue: have a good stud finder with you) and rock solid design!! Great product that I highly recommend!
4,Solution to overhead storage in the garage,I bought two of these as I needed extra storage. The units arrived within 2 days of shipment notification -WOW. Directions were clear and concise. The packaging was superior. All parts plus a few extra small bolts/washers/nuts were included. Assembly and installation were pretty straight forward. I added an extra lag screw to each ceiling bracket to insure carrying capacity of unit. I also added metal straps to improve the latteral stability. The cable ties included would work only if you installed the units end to end.Overall highly recommended.
3,Didnt work in my garage setup,"I was really hoping this would provide more floor space in my garage. I read that this would work with any garage ceiling. Upon more investigation, this system just wouldnt work with my garage. I dont have wood studs in the ceiling, but rather aluminum rails that my drywall is hanging on. This system wouldn't work too well with the aluminum rails. It's really the fault of the construction of my garage. I only found this out after I received the product in the mail. I had to pay $15 to ship this back to Amazon."
4,Great overhead storage solution,System is well designed and takes only 20 minutes to install; that includes time for a beer. Sturdy and seems to be an excellent way to add space to garage.
5,"Took a While to Install, but Works Great!","Purchased this for use in the garage as we ran out of shelf spaces against the walls. Right now it's holding tupperware containers filled with various holiday decor, plus some other random stuff that we don't access often. It feels very sturdy once hung up - I would totally buy another one."
2,Great Product - One big disappointment,"This is a great product ... with one big disappointment in my case. Every piece in every box had multiple scratches and gouges down the the bare metal with rust beginning to show. They were so bad that people asked if I had bought them used.I suspect that I received product that was misplaced for some years and was finally found and shipped out. The zip ties for holding multiple units together all snapped when I tried to pull them tight. I had to go buy new zip ties, which led me to believe that this was some very old product.Bottom line: I suggest that you buy these locally if possible. Our Lowes had the same product for about a buck less. Returns would be much faster and convenient.I agree with the other reviews that this is a well designed product. I put four up and my garage and I really like them. My only disappointment is with the condition of the product, which is why I can't give it more than two stars."
2,Time consuming to install,Took too long to install. Wire shelf in center did not fit because the holes for the screws on one of the support bars was drilled incorrectly. I would have returned it if I did not wait so long to install it.
2,Not Buying this One,"It's important when purchasing an Audio CD on Meditation that you enjoy the voice of the person leading the meditation. Sadly, Amazon doesn't offer a sample clip so I buzzed around the internet until I found a sample from the CD and it was the Breathing exercise.The mans voice sounds somewhat automated. ""Breath in two, three, four..."" I'm trying to decide if I find his voice soothing or even tolerable for meditation but then as he begins counting down (to exhale) you hear this loud ""AHHHHHHHH...."" followed by ""out two, three, four"". Kinda caught me off guard. Personally, I didn't find his voice soothing or the loud ""AHHHHHH"" relaxing. In fact, I immediately realized that I would end up feeling anxiety instead of relaxation and decided this isn't the right Meditation disc for me. Before you buy a CD, try to find a sample of the persons voice leading the meditation. Had I purchased this, I would have been truly disappointed."
5,excellent for beginers!,"I love this CD. It has almost every technique of meditation. It is very instructional which I think is great for a beginer to get a taste of what meditation techniques work best for them. LOVE it, let my friends borrow it they love it too!"
1,Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation,"This was one of the worst 'relaxation' techniques I have ever experienced. I would rate this <1, but that was not a choice. I bought two different CDs on the same day and I have listened to Indigo Dreams only twice; the first time I turned it off and the second was to make sure I heard it correctly the first time. This CD is useless to me, since I bypass most of it. The breathing exercises are absolutely horrible; the counting seems to make you FORCE your breath, as opposed to relaxing and allowing your body to do what's natural. I would not recommend this for anyone."
5,We all need affirmations,"We have had a few of Lori Lite CD's in the house now for the past 5 years. The Indigo Dream's collection has helped my son learn the skills to cope with his ADHD and Sensory issues without medication. I decided to give the adult CD a go for myself in hopes of some techniques to learn for myself with stress, which leads to anger and anxiety.I bought this CD and was really pleased with the results to which this CD has helped me with. By eliminating the stress and the calming voice and wonderful, positive affirmations that are on this CD, it has helped me to manage my stress and also helped me to make healthier food choices. Healthier food choice helped me to kick start my weight loss and I continue to fell better and better each day."
4,affirmations,I enjoyed the breathing techniques and the selection of positive affirmations to pick from. I think I can boost my self esteem with this cd.
2,okay,This was not was I expected. I didn't like this cd but maybe someone else will. I will not buy again.
1,Isobel Aura's Meditations are better,"If you only ever listen to one meditation then it should be Isobel Aura's You are Powerful Meditation, which is both calming and empowering all at the same time. There is no single meditation that I have listened to that is anywhere near as good."
4,Good product,"I have quite enjoyed this cd, it is very helpful. I don't know why a review cannot be short and to the point and needs a million words."
5,A+ for Relaxing,Liked all of the methods of relaxation/meditation in the CD ... especially the breathing and the rainbow colors flowing through the body!
1,Disappointing version of RIOT,"I'm a big RIOT Fan from the early days. This is a lot heavier version of the band and wasn't what I was hoping it would be. I just took a chance to see what they have done later. A lot of the people who like the heavier bands may enjoy this, it's just not the sound I was hoping for."
5,In the mind of Desperate Mesures,"Desperate Mesures the novel is similar to the movie. Starring Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia. Its about a NYC officer Frank(andy Gracia) who has a sun that has lucimia. He hacks into the FBI files to find a donor. While almost being caught they find only one. They were stunned to find out Peter Mcabe(Michale Keaton)that he had counts of murder, rape, and is a escappe. They finally goto to Peter Mcabe. He accepts after a few offers for plees. These offers are granted and Franks job is to save his suon before its to late because Peter has escaped!If you are lloking for suspence a little romance to keep you off your read area till the end.....I suggest you pick this one up!"
2,1998 Release,"Amazon lists this as a 2007 release when in fact it dates from 1998. In my view Bruno e Marrone haven't found their niche yet when they made this album. There are no memorable, melodious songs on this cd. As per another review of mine for this duo: if you want to buy only one Bruno e Marrone CD, buy 2003's ""Inevitavel"" - a great CD with many brilliant songs which linger in your head, esp track 2 - 4 + 13."
2,rather a let down,"I was really looking forward to reading another novel by the talented author of The Vow and The Baron. Unfortunately, this one is not nearly as heart-tugging and emotional as the former. The constant faith discussions for the first half of the book between the two leads really started to wear me down (Can we talk about something else besides religion?) And if Aislinn is so pious as to worry about breaking a commandment (like lying) - isn't fornication right up there as well - perhaps even more serious? A little contradicting.However, I did like the history info - esp the final chapter included by Garnet about her research.Inspite of this, I look forward to Garnet's next book. I still think she has incredible talent and potential."
5,Insects,Insects . this is a very educational book I keep finding information on insects that i have around my house. Very helpful.
4,nice small id book,good pictures and keysbought it as a gift and she was thrilled and has used many insect id books
5,reef fish,"used this book on our first trip to mexico, pictures are pretty amazing so many different fish in other parts of the world"
1,Delightful book on insects for a young age.,"I really enjoy Golden Guide books from St. Martin Press. They have been around for a long time where I enjoyed their small, colorful illustrative books as a child. It is fairly accurate in illustations and a brief description of the various insects that can be found. For those children who enjoy science and the curiousity of insects, this book is handy and a nice presentation of introducing them to the world of insects."
5,A True Leader,"Shackleton was an amazing man full of true grit and true leadership. Among the many things that stand out in his story of survival is the importance of keeping a journal. Even after many supplies and equipment were left on the ice, the men were instructed to continue to carry their journals. And what if they had not? Where would be the true story that outshines most fictional adventure stories in the minds and imaginations of many, including myself?If you want to read more about Antarctica, I suggest T.H. Baughman's ""Before the Heroes Came."""
5,A leeson in courage and...endurance,"Certainly a must readbook for anybody in leadership...and for any person who thinks she or he...has a problem in life....These people really had an issue...to survive in these inhuman conditions....and they did almos all of them. A credit to Shackleton leadership and charachter, as well as his people's endurance..."
4,Story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 Antarctic Expedition,Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton's own words reproduced. With a map of the Antarctic from Google you feel his incredible experience.
5,Shackelton's expedition,"Great read. Hard to put down. A very inspiring tale of endurance, adventure and devotion to the welfare of his crew."
5,Shackleton,very fascinating story of early antarctic exploration. Book can be a little challenging as a lot of words need to be looked up as they are from the early 18th century and also maritime descriptions of sea and weather conditions. but a very interesting story of the courage and sacrifices Shackleton and the men of his expedition.
3,The Story of Shackleton,"I gave this three stars because it is a slow read. It does provide a detailed account of what took place. I don't think it shows a full insight into Ernest Shackleton's leadership. I think I will now have a look at anothe book ""Leading at The Edge""."
3,Like a diary,"I found the information about Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition very interesting, but it is written like a diary so it is not as exciting to read as a typical book. However, it is very educational and provides insight to an place on earth that we hear very little about, even in the 21st century. I was impressed with the ability of the men on the expedition to withstand the environment for multiple years. It's hard to believe that they could separate into very small groups, sometimes leaving a single man in an area for more than a week."
4,South: The Story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 Expedition,"A amazing true story of courage and bravery. I found parts of it a bit long and tedious, especially when they were stuck in the ice. The amazing thing was that they all survived."
1,"Good text (I suppose), awful edition","I am sure Ernest Shackleton's account of his adventure deserve a better edition than this one. It's more like a bunch of typed pages, printed by some demestic inkjet printer, and gathered by some cheap glue.I was eager for this book, after reading four other books about the Endurance odissey. But this one is so poor that I returned it immediately after opening the package. I hope you don't make the same mistake. Try another edition.South: the story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition"
3,Other books on this journey are better,"I previously readEndurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyageabout Shackleton's voyage on the Endurance. I decided to read Shackleton's version of events and it was not even close to being as good a read as ""Endurance"". What the captain and crew accomplished is astonishing and a great testament to courage. This book may be good if you are familiar with sailing, as there are lots of latitude and longitude coordinates. It seems almost an entire chapter is filled with the weather observations of a support ship stuck in the ice and drifting for several weeks - not very compelling reading. I skimmed most of this chapter as it held no real content. I believe most readers would enjoy Lansing's work much better."
5,They all could have perished,"Except that they had an extraordinary leader,Shackleton.In this age of GPS and ships powered by the atom,there's not as much chance of adventure.This man, with a backbone of steel and against the longest odds imaginable, lost nary a man.Excellent story, and if I had a bucket list and could go back in time, I'dbe in that crew."
2,Repetitive,"I'm afraid I gave up on this one. The first hundred pages or so was like reading a Groundhog day book. Ice, cold, more ice, more cold, distance traveled. I know expeditions are like that but I got the idea early on. Can't comment on the rest of the book."
5,The most exciting advsnture that you never heard about...,I read this book after seeing a review in the Wall Street Journal 2 years ago. The horrors of the first World War pushed the story from the consciousness of the world. At every second you expect catastrophe and yet Shackleton saves every man in his expedition.What a story!!
3,"interesting at times, but the writing is lacking","I think I've been spoilt by reading dramatic non-fiction like Capote's In Cold Blood. This book came across as very dry to me. There was some good writing, but much of it was tedious, as parts were a day-to-day chronicle of Shackleton's expedition in the South. Interesting, from a historical perspective, but it gives the book a strung-together-with-pedantic-filler feeling.The description of the book that I read implied that there would be more discussion as to exactly why the expedition had problems. Although many of those issues are mentioned, it wasn't as in depth as I expected. Perhaps the historical documentation used to fill the book out wasn't as rich as the author originally anticipated. Whatever happened, the result is a book that feels choppy and stilted in too many places.There were some excellent pictures, and parts of the book were briefly exciting, but it was an uninspiring read overall."
3,fun to read,"enjoyed reading this ""old style"" writing of a great story. It was inspiring to read of the crews strength, courage and resourcefulness."
4,"missing pages, no map","Pages 153 to 180 are repeated, and then 181 to 209 are missing (gone south?). Also, there is no general map in a book which discusses the geography and navigation of the expedition at length. There are lots of good b&w photos, and the story in absorbing, but this is some seriously sloppy publishing.Rob Anzellotti"
1,Worst format ever,"I gave it one star because I just wanted to let others know that, while this looks like a great edition - and informs you TWICE on the very cover that it's quality, it isn't. The print which looks readable on the 'look inside' feature is so pale it can only be read in very bright light and it's put together like a manuscript rather than a 'quality paperback'. I felt deceived and have returned it for another version. Sir Shackleton has been done a disservice. While waiting for the new book I'm reading Worsley's Endurance."
5,This is the Real Swing Music....,"Swing music seems to have come full circle and Buddy Morrow is definately the best musician to bring a fitting tribute to Frank Sinatra to musical life. These songs all have a special touch and that comes from the golden trombone of Buddy Morrow. There is nobody better at swing and good dancing music than Buddy Morrow. He has played with Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, and has had numerous hits on his own, including ""Night Train"". Buddy now conducts The Tommy Dorsey Orchestra which travels with the ""Sinatra of the 90s"" Walt Andrus. Don't miss this album if you want to enjoy truly good music."
5,My girlfriend's fav,"Her absolute favorite movie of all time. I've never seen it, but take her word for it for what you will."
1,I love this cult film but I'm very disappointed,"I love this cult film but I was very disappointed to realize that the original French version disappeared. I'm so upset because I was waiting for this release with impatient and the result is a crappy French version.The first French version was very faithfull to the film because Watts is Watts but here, Watts is called ""Sharleen"". It's very stupid and the new dialogues are not so strong in style and humour.To sum up, it's a good film but I hate the new French version very bad in the DVD"
1,I never received this product,"I guess I really couldn't give an accurate review of the product since I never received it. I've seen the movie before and I really liked it, so I was hoping to see it again."
4,Masterson steals it ! ! !,"Cute in the sense that it rises above most teen-angst films of the era. Boy likes girl, girl doesn't know he exists but his best friend adores him. Mary Stuart Masterson was the right pick for the character of Watts. Notice the kiss scene: Masterson exhibits the perfect balance of nervous tension and school girl charm, holding back and striking at the right moment. Mary, you should have gotten tons of work after this performance but I think you were typecasted. At least we still have this film to cherish. The Paramount DVD is nearly worthless; sporting only a crispy widescreen transfer without a commentary or any other extras. That's too bad."
4,I just wish it had a better title,"""Some Kind Of Wonderful""? The title makes it sound like a light Maeve Binchy novel. The first time I saw this movie on TV I couldn't get over the incredible acting mostly because of the name, because a title means alot in a film. I definetely wasn't expecting this."
4,Pretty In Pink with a sex change...,"Very cute movie by eighties teen film master, John Hughes, has a young Eric Stoltz as the poor kid trying to land a date with Lea Thompson, playing the rich girl, even though Mary Stuart Masterson, Stoltz's tomboy best friend, is really in love with him. I really liked this one, I can't imagine why it's the only one of Hughe's teen flicks that never got alot of attention considering it's up there with Ferris Bueller and Sweet Sixteen. Perhaps cinema audiences were getting tired of the formula at the time but in retrospect it's a sweet, funny little drama with the goofy late-Eighties settings and costumes we all know and love."
3,good movie!,"Some Kind Of Wonderful remains one of my favorite 80s movies. Not quite up there with Pretty In Pink, but nonetheless very entertaining. Eric Stolz is great as the loner Keith and I totally sympathize with Mary Stuart Masterson's Watts. The girl has it bad and she's only seen as a friend. She suffers from the ""Ducky"" syndrome a la Pretty In Pink. Lea Thompson is also very appealing in this role. Awesome music!! I especially love the song playing during the scene where Keith and Watts ""Kiss"" in the garage. Can't wait for the dvd! :)"
3,Nice little movie,Good cast. Good story. A nice little teen movie from the past but it was a little better than just a teen movie. Had a big crush back then on Mary Stuart Masterson and her character here and in 'At Close Range' with Shawn Penn. Eric Stolz was great in his role and so was pretty much the rest of the cast. I was rooting the whole time for Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson to get together in the end.Good little movie from the past.
3,Hmm it is some kind of wonderful!,"I love this movie. Pure 80's romantic comedy! Eric Stoltz is blind to see the love right in front of his face, while chasing for the love of the high school beauty (Lea Thompson). A great movie to watch, if you want to revisit your dramatic high school crushes."
5,Good teen movie from the past...,I'm in the process of finding the old 80s movies that I'd seen and liked. This was a decent movie and will make a nice addition to my collection...
3,movie,"I havd never ordered a DVD on line and was not aware of what a ""Region 2"" item was. Now I am stuck with this DVD and Ican not even watch it."
4,FEEL GOOD MOVIE,OMG! this movie was filmed at my high school! Its so trippy. San Pedro High. Its a nice good movie. A girls night movie
4,Three great actors for the price of one.,"How can you lose? You've got Stoltz, Masterson and Thompson, all before they became big stars. The teen angst is genuine, the characters a little too cute, but the ending just what every heartsick high-schooler could want. Masterson serves every tomboy/unappreciated best friend just right."
5,BEST TEEN FLICK EVER,"I am not a John Hughes fan, but this disarming movie takes the ""teen"" out of teen flick. The characters are so keenly drawn, and the poignant, potent romantic entanglements so utterly winning, that this movie is hard to resist. Mary Stuart Masterson is simply heartbreaking in this movie, and unaffecedly so; Eric Stoltz has never been more appealing, or attractive. The details follow suit -- from Keith's realistic family to the Barbie-like world of the ""pretty kids"". This simple movie earns its well-deserved emotional lift, and remains with you."
4,The adult film that isn't really an adult film!,"SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is an adult film because it is now 21 years old. It was theatrically released 21 years ago today,as a matter of fact. And is not an adult film because it is not pornographic(this may make you chuckle). Anyway,director John Hughes(PLANES TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES,SHE'S HAVING A BABY,CURLY SUE,HOME ALONE 1 & 2),worked with a talented cast featuring Eric Stoltz(MASK),Lea Thompson(HOWARD THE DUCK),Mary Stuart Masterson(FUNNY ABOUT LOVE,FRIED GREEN TOMATOES) and John Ashton(BEVERLY HILLS COP 1 & 2,MIDNIGHT RUN,LITTLE BIG LEAGUE). Thompson and MSM are respectively,Stoltz's love interests. Interestingly,MSM plays drums in the film. Ashton is Keith's(Stoltz) father Cliff,a service station attendant. This film,like many others,features a great pop music soundtrack. Subsequently,Ashton had cameos in SHAB and CS."
5,OLD TIME FAVORITE,I have always liked this movie ever since it came out in the 80's. I had it on VHS but I kept looking for it on DVD everywhere. I decided to look on Amazon cause Amazon has everything...and I found it. Thanks amazon!
3,Some Kind Of Disappointment !,"I love this movie.It is my absolute favorite from 1987-88. It made me a lifelong fan of the wonderful Mary Stuart Masterson and fans of Lea Thompson and Eric Stoltz too. Read the other reviews to see how good this movie is. However, the DVD was not what I hoped. It is wide screen but does not appear to be anamorphic. The color is good but not great, same for the picture and sound quality. However, for a DVD with a list price of $$$$ you expect SOME extras but you get absolutely nothing! No trailer, no deleted scenes, no making of feature, no director commentary no Easter Eggs No NOTHING! ZIP. NADA.This DVD is an improvement over the tape and LD versions I had before but could have been so much more. ... I give the movie five stars but the DVD only two with three stars overall. LW"
3,A review that amazon requested,This movie was for my wife. Hope she likes it I haven't bn able to watch it. I accidentally erased this movie on our DVr and she was very upset. So I went to amazon cause they seem to have everything I need and found it at a very low price. So glad cause she like those old movies.
4,Good,The cover of this movie was a little more worn than what I was hoping but the movie played perfect and that is what is most important. I am happy with my purchase.
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome.","This 2nd release from Vaz (a project from the band Hammerhead) will never be labeled as a ""sophomore slump"". The chaos of these songs blazes through 30 minutes of rock so quickly you'll miss it the instant the last note is struck. The duo juggle time signatures and rhythms from one moment to the next, leaving barely enough time for them to breathe in between songs.Beyond the eerie similarity to Ian Curtis's voice, what stands out is how melodic the vocals are. Downright catchy at times, these tunes are what mainstream rock radio could sound like if it were actually interesting. But songs about drive-by swordfights and lifelike headless statues are not mainstream fodder, and for that we have Vaz. We should consider ourselves lucky."
2,Big disapointment,"My 5 year old loves TMNT and received this for Christmas. The box boasts that the copter can fit all 4 ninjas but this is misleading as we could barely cram one in and still manage to close the windshield. There are handholds on the outside for the other turtles. Further, the helicopter's blades repeatedly fall out and so does the back (tail)portion."
4,Great book!!,"Excellent book! I was really astounded by the authors knowledge on building cart-type race vehicles. He explains a lot of suspension theories and chassis designing theories. Though I was hoping for more information on the rally aspect of this book, it was entertaining to see how older rally vehicles had advantages and disadvantges. The only reason the book gets a 4* is because it doesn't have as much information on prepping and building a car for rallying. That would've made this book that much better. I would only get this book if you are going to build a cart type vehicle for school, or racing."
4,review,"the book was in excellent condition, even better than what the seller labeled it as.it came very quickly too"
5,Should Have Read It First,"Highly recommend book to every man who is contemplating marriage. I wish I had read it before I had gotten married and un-married. The book raises issues that every man should consider before making that leap of faith. Simply put, love is not enough."
3,"..An ""OK"" source","Schaums outline of Russian Grammer is structured like a workbook, with brief explanations of different aspects of Russian grammer, followed by numerous exercises. It is helpful if you are taking a Russian language course as well, but if you are not taking a course, this book alone cannot help you. I have used many of the grammer books, and the source that has worked best for me is Master the Basics by Natalia LUsin. For people taking a language course, it is a great study guide, and simply the best for teaching grammer to yourself if you are not enrolled in a class."
3,A very difficult book to follow,"A good book, but...why does the author use italics to highlight the words he is trying to make some grammatical point about? I know I need to eventually learn italics (5 small Russian letters don't look anything like the standard letters) but not now."
5,Need some quick revision? Get this!,"As I am currently studying for my university Russian exams, this book is an absolute goldmine for practice exercises and simple explanations into noun endings, cases, numerals, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Very helpful!"
3,DEAD END-good but....,"This movie reminded me of a combination of several movies. First there is a lot of Blair Witch Project in it-instead of walking in the woods, they are driving...endlessly in circles, with wierd things happening along the way. Most of the movie evolves around this theme just as Blair Witch did--but Blair Witch was a lot creepier.Add a touch of The Others-well I'll be giving away some plot but if you seen The Others you will see what I mean.But I am not saying it is a bad movie. In fact, it held my attention but not what I call a great movie either. It's an even ""okay"" movie but elements of the film are very familiar from other movies I've seen. So the originality of it is not that great.It's an okay rent, but it is something I would not purchase for a lot of money to get, and I would not be in a rush to get it either."
5,"Great horror needs no dissection, just viewing","But since you're curious...This was darn good soup! Great horror flick. The Journey of the Doomed is what it was (my term). The gore is mostly implied. Doesn't matter. The plot and acting get the point across just fine. Lots of shock moments, lots of tension, lots of despair as the hoplessness of their situation grows clearer. Somewhat predictable here and there but good stuff for a Friday night. I recognized the mom but couldn't place her - she was the landlord in Kingpin. I always wondered what she looked like in real life. Ray Wise always satisfies. I like anything he ever does. I think it's because of the bond I developed with him in the Twin Peaks series. The son needed a slap and cracked me up continuously. This movie is creepy, disturbing, and fun."
2,I don't regret renting it,"This was a ridiculous movie; there were a few creepy scenes, but I found this to be more of a comedy than a horror. The acting was lame, but that is to be expected with a film like this. It wasn't very scarry, but I thought the scene where the shadows danced around the car was down right freaky. I also liked the aerial shots of the car moving through the endless forrest, but it was the comedy that gives this lame flick 2.5 stars....I thought the part where the Father walked into the barb wired fence was hilarious. Not great (not even good) but I've seen worst (i.e. Ghost Watcher)."
1,Abysmal.,"I love horror movies but this has awful acting, writing, directing...it's one of the biggest letdowns I've seen recently. I kept hearing how genuinely creepy and fun this is but it is legitimately HORRIBLE. Stay away!"
2,"2.5 STARS, Do not pay $20","This movie gets 2 1/2 stars . The acting is pretty good along with the idea of the story. I thought it was ok in a way similar to the Blair witch project. A bit creepy and wierd, not enough to scare anyone but worth of one viewing. If you can find this movie for $7 maybe 8, $10 the most then I guess give it a shot. I rented it and found out that i will not and would not buy this movie even for $1, because if im hungry I could buy one egg roll or 2 spring rolls from the chinese restaurant for $1, I also wouldnt waste the $1 because i will never watch it agian. Its the type of movie rent first then decide but no way in hell is this movie worth more than $10, so please dont waste $20, this movie is being very overrated by everyone. 3 stars is high for this flick but excepotable."
2,I felt cheated... *~Ending spoiler~*,"The idea of this movie was great! And it had plenty of creepy elements and had me thinking the whole way through it. That is up until the last 7 minutes or so...I don't like putting that much thought into a movie, getting all creeped out and such only to be told at the end basically ""it was all a dream!"" What a ripoff!I know not everything was a dream; i.e. Marian's whole family was killed in the crash (but IN THE CRASH, not in the disturbing ways in which we see them die!). I just feel like I don't know what the point was. And then, the pasty black-haired guy who saved Marian from the accident driving his black hearse comes on looking all creepy for the last 2 minutes and I'm left thinking ""What the F?""I dunno... I was told by a few people that this movie was so fantastic and that I had to see it, so I did. I'm certainly not making any recommendations here. See this if you want, but if you're like me, be prepared for a let down at the end."
1,Don't be fooled by the positive reviews,"Lets see here, horrible acting = check, horrible script = check, bad special effects = check. I am always on the look out for good horror movies but this was such a disappointment. Horrible, just flat out horrible."
1,Run away!,This movie is almost has bad as Manos: THe Hands of FateAhh! Run away before you lose precious minutes of your life!
1,HORRIBLE....JUST HORRIBLE.,"If you are familiar with Lionsgate, a film company with a bad track record, you won't be suprised by my next words: this film is crap. The only highlight of it was at the end where Steve Valentine makes an appearance, though it's only for about seven minutes or so. Don't waste your time on this. Life is too short."
1,dead end,"this dvd came from america. we did not know you cannot view it, as it states ""out of region"" and our dvd players (x3) will not read it."
3,An interesting twist,"DEAD END is a film which seemed to skip the cinemas and head straight to video. My review is based on the Australian DVD release of 6 October.DEAD END focusses on a family who are travelling on christmas eve to visit their family. They have been taking the same route for 20 years, but on this occassion, the father decides to take a different route. Big mistake! From then on, nothing goes right. It's hard to take the characters seriously as they seem to overeact to everything, but by the end of the film you will understand why. The film contains an interesting twist that I cannot give away.Worth seeing if you enjoy films with a bit of tension and horror thrown in. I was a tad disappointed in the film overall, it just got too annoying for its own good in parts.DEAD END Region 4 DVD contains talent profiles, trailers for other movies, and a 16:9 widescreen transfer."
2,DEAD SPIN!,An okay scary movie but waaaaay too long. It seems to go in circles and never ends. I think it's still playing on my DVD player right now ..... Now THAT'S scary!
4,An Entertaining Ride,"I generally enjoy well produced horror movies with all the effects and so on. Therefore, I had little hope for this low budget film before I watched it, but I was pleasantly surprised when it was over. This movie starts a little slow but builds nicely. There isn't much gore, as matter of fact you don't actually see anyone getting killed at all. All that said, somehow this film flows and gives enough chills topped off with some funny one liners to make this a ride to remember. The ending was kind of lame, but I still would recommend checking this one out anyway."
4,Graduates of the Roman Polanski School,"This is the first movie that has managed to successfully creep me out in quite a while. The visuals are done in classic Roman Polanski fashion, and some of them stayed with me long into the night. It's too bad that a movie like this had to be lost on the Blockbuster video shelves, when it probably could have done well with a theatrical release. Shame on Lion's Gate for burying this one and making such a fuss over House of 1000 Corpses instead.Ray Wise has been one of my favorites since Twin Peaks, and he's up to his old tricks in this movie. I would hate to have that guy as my father. The story is fairly predictable, but manages to give the audience enough creepy images and scares along the way to make it worth a watch.Dead End is not a perfect horror movie, there are moments where the protagonists make some questionable decisions, but it's better than most. Four stars for these French first timers."
4,Better than Blair Witch Project...,"I'm typically not a big fan of horror films; many of them are predictable, completely unbelievable, and so poorly written that they rely on gory special effects to compensate for a plethora of plot and character deficits...""Dead End"" avoids many of the typical horror flick pitfalls--except, perhaps, predictability--and engrosses the viewer psychologically. While it is true that there are some similarities between ""Dead End"" and the ""Blair Witch Project,"" ""Dead End"" is better written, more engrossing, and uses superior cinematography to create the overall mood. A must see for anyone interested in intelligent horror..."
4,Good Horror Film,"Feels more like a twilight zone episode that someone decided to make into a movie, so I couldn't really give this one a full 5 stars. I picked the movie up because it was on sale at the local Best Buy and the jacket cover featuring the hand coming out of the hearse looked interesting. I was worried that it was going to be just a waste of money, but it turned out to have enough frights to be a good horror movie. Without giving away too much, I will say that this movie was disturbing enough that it altered my driving habits, albeit for a day."
3,Send back,Love this movie but had to send it back cuz it wouldnt work in my dvd player plus I found it somewhere else.
5,A Great Learning Tool!,"As a vet student I am using this book to study for anatomy. The pictures are detailed and accurate! This is a great resource for learning equine anatomy, and coloring in the pictures helps with memorization."
3,"Great, basic book.","An easy to understand, entry level book that imparts a nice starting point for those wishing to learn about equine anatomy. Well detailed without overwhelming the reader. And, of course, the coloring book aspect is a lot of fun."
4,very good supplement,This book is a great supplement especially because there doesn't seem to be a lot of good horse anatomy diagrams published.
4,"Good overview, nice drawings","This item is named 'coloring atlas', so I expected colours and pictures, but it is drawings with no colours. This book gives an excellent overview i a very systematic manner. Good to get understanding, but not details i excess."
3,It's Good Trashy Fun and We get to see What all the....,"Hullabaloo was about Angie Dickinson in one of her best nude scenes.This movie has few redemming social values, other than it's shot pretty good, and it has a weak plot and some beautiful women, including a former supporting actress from ""Eight is Enough,"" Ms. Dickinson, and even ""Captain Kirk."" But, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good period campy movie..."
3,A message to 'A viewer',"I feel like a fraud, because I have not recently seen this film. I just wanted to let 'a viewer' in Stockton know that I knew Robbie Lee [actress playing Polly] in 1972. I was almost 13 and in 7th grade, and she was just out of high school. So I would guess she was close to 20 [give or take a year] when this film was made."
2,As good as I remember,"Not sure why Angie did this one, but it is good, fun and she is absolutely beautiful when she is in bed with William Shatner and the guy from Top Gun (Not Tom Cruise.. his boss at Top Gun)"
3,"Pretty good vintage Dickinson, Shatner","Saw the movie years ago. You know how time does. Didn't think it was as great as I remembered. Still an action movie. Not altogether bad, just not as good as I thought I remembered."
1,Big Bad Mama,"Angie is beautiful,the Brunette is Beautiful,the music great the action when it's on good. but it is slow paced and on top of that little jabs at Rockerfeller,Free-Market/Open Market/Capitalism and taking pot shots at Organized Religion specifically Christianity(Of course the biblethumpers in the movie are accurate,being they are protestant sects and not Catholic.)But nonetheless Corman as most hollywood Resents people of faith as if having Faith is a bad thing.This is one of those Movies you wait to see on skinamax instead of being praised for a good movie it's a sub-par B-Movie that dares to invoke smug elitism,and Who can stand Shatner except a Trekkie? or Skeritt(Cousin Strawberry in Up in Smoke.)This is not a hoot,I prefer Six-pack Annie."
3,angie yes,"in thefirst movie angie is her usual stunning self, not an actress more of a physical curiosity. but i have always have loved her and enjoy watching despite the poor acting. the sequel is just awful and a rip-off of the first one. angie at 60 years of age was justused to sell the movie and too old for the part."
2,Big bad mama/big bad mama II ( Roger Corman's Cult Classic,"these movie's in my apenion are not that great, the action seems phoney, the way they run around there shooting, and the way they talk, all the action just seems phoney to me i'm sorry but that is my apenion. SG"
4,Campy Fun,"From the retrospective included on the disc you get the impression that star Angie Dickinson thought she was making high art. I'm not so sure Roger Corman thought so. The film seems to have a split personality. Stars Dickinson, Tom Skerritt, and William Shatner play their characters pretty straight to the vest. The script, however, suggests a parody of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" with alot of comic violence and gunplay and humorously gratuitous nudity. I did enjoy the contributions of the young actresses playing Dickinson's daughters, Susan Sennett and Robbie Lee. I purchased this film expecting some trashy fun and it did deliver the goods."
1,Spend your time on something else.,The author needs to group together the VisualAge IDE concepts and separate them from the program development concepts. If you took out all the wordiness the book would be half the size. This book was aweful!
4,Great Book to Learn VisualAge for Java,"This book is great for someone who already knows Java, but needs to learn VA quickly. I will be joining a project that uses VA so I need to jump from a text editor to an IDE. This book shows you how to move around easily in VisualAge. It gives tips and tricks of the tool and gives good examples to clarify the text. If you want to learn the Java language, this book is not for you. I didn't give 5 stars because I would have liked more information on advanced features of the tool for servlets and EJB's. However, with the start-up I got from this book, I can learn that on my own."
5,Great Book on VisualAge,This is a great book for learning how to use VisualAge for Java. There are many hints and tips on how to develop java programs and use the IDE.
3,Not Comprehensive,This book is not comprehensive. Some of the topics are not clear. Good book for beginners not experts.
4,If only it weren't so heavy,"I do like this bag, it looks nice, has plenty of padding to keep your computer safe and has nice sections for pens, drink etc. Loads of room for all your stuff and the actual computer compartment seems big enough to fit the largest of laptops. But the problem is that it's a bit heavy. I have never used a laptop bag so maybe they're all like this but the empty bag is certainly not lightweight and when you do fill it up it weighs a ton. The product description said it has been designed with some enhanced comfort feature but I can't see how this could ever make much difference as you still have all the weight on one shoulder.Anyway, it's perfect if you want to look cool getting out of your car but if you want to walk further than a couple of minutes with it I would suggest looking for something lighter."
5,Great bag,This is a great bag especially for the price. It is very comfortable. The bag hugs your body instead of bouncing against your leg. It fits a large laptop and has plenty of room.
2,Disappointing.,"After viewing ""The Million Dollar Strip Off,"" I was hoping us Americans could do a lot better. Again, very amateurish, with women who were not that hot. What can I say? If you want a tantalizing strip video, I guess you have to go to a strip club with a camera and tape it yourself."
3,Chilton's Jeep Wrangler/Yj 1988-90,"I've found this book very helpful, but it's not the best book for those who are looking for ""do it your self"" repairing book."
2,"Great concept, but completely missing content","A great idea for a book but it falls flat in execution. The book promises several plugins and support files are available on its website but no such site exists. The book was published in July and still nothing. You cannot use Chapters 16 or 19 whatsoever, which were the exact reasons for my purchase. The site claims the hurricane is to blame. While I do have sympathies, wasn't that after July? Wouldn't you have your support site ready to go at publishing time? I have so far gotten no response from emailed queries about the missing content. I do not recommend this book due to this situation, which is a shame as it held so much promise. If you don't mind missing that portion, then perhaps you'll like this resource."
1,Why didn't I check reviews?????,"I purchased this book after browsing it at the bookstore and reading about all the nifty extra downloads available at the book's ""companion site."" Guess what? All the reviews are right - there IS NO SITE. It is now May of 2007 and the site STILL says it is ""coming soon,"" with no explanation. The companion site (which sounded very cool in the book)was never developed and not only is there no explanation at the site - but not even here at Amazon where Matt Haughey and the other authors have the opportunity to write in the book blog - or leave comments to the reviews in answer to all those wondering about what happened. I just don't get it. The silence is deafening. No site? A disappointment, but no problem that can't be forgiven if someone just took the time to offer those of us who spent $30.00 an explanation. But even after 2 years of publication, that seems to be too much trouble. Shame."
1,No online content,"I bought this book at full price and was disgusted to find out the website they direct you to has no content! At the bookstore, I was excited by all of the examples and code I could download from hackingmt.com. I accessed the website at home and there was nothing on it. There is some value to the book, but much of the advanced material is all on the missing website. Terrible!"
5,This Time,"As with all products it is essential that you receive your merchandiseas quickly as possible,and in the condition you have been promised.Well- this transaction exceeded my expectations on both counts.The product arrived much faster than had been predicted and it's condition was absolutely pristine-all in all i'm extremely impressedand would not hesitate to use this service again."
4,"It's 2009, How about a Digital Download of this gem?","Just a shout out to get this album on digital download. From the heyday of Jarreau's golden era this album is full of great singing and some real gems in the Jarreau catalog. ""Never Giving Up"" is one of those optimistic songs that Al specializes in and his version of ""Spain"" is my favorite rendition of all time."
5,Mary's stations of the cross,"I'm not a fan of Angelina's singing voice, but the text of this CD is very moving and inspirational"
1,Boring & Pedantic,"If I'd wanted a lecture on an author's opinions of ecology, I'd have been better off buying a textbook. The nuts and bolts of what a guidebook should provide -- descriptions and details of hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions are presented in a shopping list style that is less useful than the yellow pages.I want my money back!"
2,Yellow (only) Pages for multi-colored country,I was deeply disappointed with this travel book. It is merely a list of hotel and restaurant options (with a few activities thrown in) that does little to help you separate and decide what is worthwhile. The overall organization is terrible as is the index.In the section on sports there is nothing on hiking tours and hiking is not in the index.You will do much better with Lonely Planet!
5,Must Have,"Im not sure why this book hasnt gotten more raves than it has. This is and excellant,well written story and is much better than I expected it to be. The development and uniqueness of the Night Lords is very well done, as is the character development of the Inquisitress. The w40k fiction universe is fantastic,but in desperate need of some fresh life and different character behaviors. This book really achieves that, and I would love to see a sequel."
4,Lord of the Night review,"I just finished Lord of the Night and really enjoyed this book. It is about Zso Sahaal, a traitor space marine, who is the leader of the Night Lord Legion and must recover a stolen artifact. The book is about instilling fear into your enemy. There is lots of action and gore. The book is very vivid and there is wonderful character development. The book alternates between the two protagonist's points of view but flows well."
3,It's not terrible......,"However I've read better. Alot of the time Simon spent describing the main character, I couldn't tell if he was talkinga about a chaos marine or an insect. It was damn slow getting going, but about a 1/4 of the way into it, it definately got my attention. Apart from the insect like descriptions of the chaos marine, and the slow moving of the first 70 or so pages, it's not a bad book. Not the best offering from the Black Library, but certainly not the worst."
4,Dark and moody,I found LotD to be enthralling and unputdownable. I can't wait to see a sequel to this novel with the Night Lord and the interrogator characters coming back again. Fantastic!!!!
3,This was to be their original farewell!,"The first seven songs were recorded live in Edmonton, at what was to be one of the final gigs. The live tracks are top notch recordings. The remainder of this disc is comprised mainly of throw away studio tracks, alternate takes and some old early rare comp tracks they re-recorded for fun. This was to be their Cargo records contract farewell. This was to be the first time SNFU called it quits. A ""Daily Book of Fun Facts"" piece. Depending on what member in the band you ask to date SNFU had stood for three different little common phrases. Number one-S.N.A.F.U. (Situation Normal All F**ked Up) was the original name but they dropped the A as people kept circling the A and this annoyed them a bit according to an old Chi Pig interview. Number two-S.N.F.U. (Society's Not For You) Only heard of once in a different MRR or Flipside interview. and Number three-S.N.F.U. (Society's No F**king Use) is the final true meaning."
4,"Good, but not great foam mattress","I bought this mattress for the guest room because the price seemed extremely cheap. After unpacking the foam it takes about 2 days to fully expand and once it does its a fairly good mattress. If you press your hand on the foam it does not retain the memory of the hand and is over all significantly stiffer than other memory foam products. That being said it is still comfortable, but it offers no clear advantage over a spring mattress in my opinion. You won't be disappointed with this, however you certainly will not be thrilled."
3,Excellent Overview of One of the World's Top Air Forces.,"More than almost any other nation on earth, Israel relies for its survival on a large, superbly trained and equipped air force ready for instant action. Sam Katz, a veteran profiler of the world's elite counter-terrorist and police forces gives an excellent overview of how this amazing organization operates. The highlight, however, is undoubtedly the chapter on the incredibly demanding selection and training process for Israeli pilots. Katz's trademark ""buff"" prose grates after awhile, but overall, a fine handbook."
5,As good as everyone says,"Just as good as the rest of the reviewers here said. Took about 2 hours to replace a 3-year-old Kenmore that had cracked and was leaking -- and extremely noisy. That included installing the plug-in cord accessory. It was easy because we had just had the last disposal professionally installed, so I didn't have to deal with the old copper connections and such in our 1970-built home. Very quiet operation -- just an electric hum, even when processing food. There was some loud rattling the first few times we turned it on, so I initially was disappointed, but that disappeared as the unit seemed to wear in to place.Paid $169 at Home Depot. Now we can put things back under the sink again!"
4,BE CAREFUL!,BE CAREFUL!The InSinkErator Evolution is so quiet when it is runningthat you may forget that it is ON. Very smooth operationand NO noise...
5,Quiet and works very well,This turned out to be a great deal and the disposal is pretty quiet not to mention it grinds everything well.
5,NICE !,"Although I bought from Home Depot (same $ as online) locally (5 minutes from house) I will still give my thoughts. I use the reviews seriously when buying product. I read some good and bad. After buying this and installing it I think the ones who gave bad reviews are morons. First this is the quietest disposal I ever heard. The person who reviewed as noisy certainly did not install it properly. The one lady who couldn't hold it up and used a car jack to do so deserves some credit for using her brain because I did the same thing as not to struggle. I took my time and used all the suggestions and it is still running great. The old disposal was a InSinkEator but a lower model and was all rusted, only 9 years old. Hopefully this one will last a lot longer. Great purchase !Read all the reviews and take the good with the bad. Sometimes you have to use your brain."
5,Amazingly Quiet,"I recently bought a new Kohler Task Center Pro (see separate review) and wanted 2 new Insinkerators for each of the basins. These units are so quiet that it is very hard to tell if they are even on! Highly, highly recommend!"
5,"QUIET,STRONG, EASY TO INSTALL","I HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT THE CHEAPER DISPOSALS IN THE PAST, AND THEY WORKED, BUT AFTER INSTALLING THE INSINKERATOR 3/4 HP, I NOW SEE THE DIFFERENCE. EVEN THOUGH THIS ONE ISN'T THE TOP OF THE PRODUCT LINE, IT IS MUCH QUIETER AND DEFINITELY SEEMS STRONGER THAN WHAT I HAVE HAD. THE INSTALL WAS VERY EASY AND FAST, EXCEPT FOR HAVING TO WORK UNDER AND IN A SINK CABINET."
5,Workin' Great!,"Installed it about 2 months ago. If you currently have an Insinkerator, they best thing about them is that they are universal with themselves! We took the old one out and used the same fitting connected to the sink to mount the new disposal. It took about an hour or so to install, but it's one of those things where once you've installed it one time, the next time it could be done in 15 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone. It's a little pricey over the cheaper models, but I've found that it works like a champ and is much, much quieter than my previous Insinkerator."
5,Great Purchase,"Evolution Compact disposal from InSinkErator is so quiet and easy to install (replaced previous 20 year old InSinkErator product). Another person commented on the poor rubber baffle design (""the baffle requires assistance to put anything into the disposal"") but I have found this feature a postitve. It has already saved my daughter's ring and a random wingnut from going into the disposal. Very happy with my purchase and hope that it lasts for another 20 years :)"
5,Great garbage disposal,I've had this installed for a while and have had no problems. It is a pretty quiet unit and runs smoothly. It has never jammed up and works flawlessly.
5,My First Garbage Disposer Installed,"The instructions are very well written. They also explain how to uninstall your old unit (if need be). It took me about an hour and a half to install and I'm not handy. I needed to pick up some plumbers putty, but, otherwise, everything was in the box. It's very quiet and there's no vibration. It's pretty small. About an inch smaller than my 10 year old 1/2 HP. Anyone who wants to save money on having one professionally installed should get this slightly more expensive unit."
5,Great Disposer! Worth a bit more than the cheap ones.,"Ok, so this is the first disposer I've used in my own house that cost more than $75. Let me tell you it's worth paying a bit more! I put one of these in my remodeled kitchen 6 months ago and it is super quiet. Way better than the standard unit. I highly recommend. -Matt Risinger"
1,Planned Obsolescence,"Five years after purchasing this, not only has the motor burned up, but the bottom is just about to rust through. I don't find this acceptable, as the previous (Kenmore) model lasted more than 20 years. And those 20 years were the years spent with 6-8 people in the house, now it is just two of us. I'm disappointed to say the least, and absolutely FED UP with planned obsolescence. Obviously IT IS (or was?) possible to make a disposal that lasted a lot longer. I'm delving through reviews right now trying to find a replacement that is quality, but most of the review relate to installation and sound. Perhaps this will be helpful to those of you not wanting to relive this process five years from now?"
5,Exceeds Expectations,"I am the sort who reads consumer reports and online product reviews before making a decision -- even about a garbage disposal. This seems to be a fine product. I had read someone who said it was so quite they thought it wasn't working. I thought, ""yea, right."" But then the same thing happened to me. When I first turned it on (without waste the first time), I had to look to be certain it was even functioning. One quick caution -- I also had to use larger wire nuts than the ones that came with the electrical connection kit. Also, there seem to be two versions of the evolution disposal out there. I have seen both a 5/8 hp and a 3/4 hp by the same name at two major competing home supply retailers. I have the 3/4hp from Amazon. While I suspect they are both fine, you will want to be aware of what you are getting."
4,Replaced old ISE Disposer that had a crack,"Installation went rather well. No leaks, pretty good instructions. (wish this manual was linked here in PDF form before I ordered since not all parts are included. I had to also purchase wire nuts, Romex connector (http://www.amazon.com/Romex%C2%AE-Connector-1-2-in/dp/B0003S2MEQ) and lastly some plumbers putty.)All in all, removal, purchasing new parts and full installation took 2-3 hours.Solid motor, quiet."
5,Hard to believe...,"This thing is really, really quiet. The two stage grind process really gets the job done on things like potato peelings. Let's hope the longevity is better with the higher quality internal components over the Badger series. If you are replacing one of the Badger disposals, the sink mount ring is identical so you can eliminate that step if you choose to.Overall, I am very pleased with the unit. It really is true that the running water is louder than this disposal."
2,Stopped Working after 1 Year,I would have rated this 5 stars but it stopped working after a year. I have a service repairman from the in-home warranty department coming to check it out but I think the motor burned out. It wasn't used that hard either.
1,Technical Support=FAIL,So before I bought I called their 800 number to get tech info and see how they handle customers. My view is the back end is always the true indicator of the company.Customer and technical support is located in the Philippines. Twenty minute wait and then almost moronic clarification.Decided against inviting future problems and gave the purchase a miss.
5,"So far, excellent",Have had it a month and it works great. It's compact so it's great for space under the sink yet its super strong and amazingly quiet. We went from an old badger I think it was 1/3hp to this and man is the noise difference noticeable. I didn't realize garbage disposals could be so quiet!
5,very satisfied,"Very good and quiet operation compared to the unit it replaced.3/4 HP is the better minimum choice for most households--IMOBe aware that unit doe's not come with power cord but if it isa replacement then you can probably use the previous wiring,otherwise you will need to purchase the cord separately.One last reminder....be sure to break out the plastic stopperif your are adding the drain hose from a dishwasher!!"
4,Brand New,"I just purchased and installed this unit and the power cord (sold separately). The install was pretty straight forward and simple. I had never installed or removed a disposal before. I removed the old until in bout 2 - 3 minutes. I used all of the new parts which came in the box replacing the old part. The hardest part of the install was lining the disposal up, under the sink, and connecting it to the flange (which still wasn't difficult took about 5 minutes).I ran the water for a couple of minutes while checking for leaks. I was pleasantly surprised when we turned the disposal on. It was so much quieter than the old unit. In fact, I actually thought, is it working? When the old unit began to malfunction sometimes it would only hum, opposed to spinning as it should. I'm if you are looking for a new disposal, then you know the humming sound I'm talking about. This new unit, running, chopping food, is about as loud as that hum."
4,Quiet and efficient,"In the month or so since we installed the InSinkErator Evolution 3/4HP disposer, it has lived up to its favorable reviews. It is extremely quiet and performs as advertised. We were able to install it ourselves in about one hour, replacing an older InSinkErator 3/4HP disposer. The old model did not last as long as I expected, so my only concern is whether this model will be equally short-lived. For now, I recommend it."
3,Decent,"This make and model of Product Meets expectations thus far , however over time will be indicator of durability of unit."
1,ISE 3/4 HP teeth broke off less than 1 year - from Lowe's,"ISE 3/4 HP teeth broke off less than 1 year - from Lowe's, Allen, TXInSinkErator ESSENTIAL 3/4 Horsepower Dura Drive, Multigrind Technology"
1,Cracked and Useless,"I would never buy an item from this company again. I purchased an insinkerator, The box arrived with no packaging material surrounding the product. The housing of the insinkerator was cracked, our plumber said it would leak if he installed it. I tried to return the product but EvVive said it was too late. I first called to return the product when the plumber took it out of the box two weeks after it arrived. I e-mailed them 17 days after it arrived. They responded 25 days after it arrived and said it was more than 30 days and I cannot return it. I purchased an insinkerator from another company and the EvVive product is worthless sitting in my garage. If it was a more than a $300.00 loss I would surely be in court to sue for damages."
4,So far so good,"Quiet and powerful, very compact and easy to install. Unit is what I needed for a limited space installation. Based on previous experience with this brand looking forward to many years of good service from this unit. Just wish they would include a power cord wit the unit but you can always use the cord from your old disposal. Pricing was very good better than I could find locally."
5,Concise advice for every new manager,"Most young managers were outstanding individual performers before promotion to management, and many get the bulk of their basic management training on the job. This concisely written, vastly informative handbook from the Harvard Business Essentials series covers the basic skills all managers need to know. Richard Luecke and Christopher Bartlett divide the book into three sections - learning the basics, reaching the next level and mastering the financial tools a manager needs - with the key topics listed at the beginning of each chapter. We say if you think of this book as the coaching you would receive from a smart, well-connected mentor, you will get an idea of its tone. It contains no esoteric or faddish advice, but solid, practical tips, presented in a way you can use right now."
1,13? Book is nothing but stale dough - NO MEAT you will gain,"I honestly can't belive this qualifies as a book. Sure, Harvard is a excellent school. However, don't let this book fool you."
2,captain america,"very disappointing in light of some of the great serials that have been remastered. the quality of this dvd is no better that the vhs tape i have, which is poor."
3,Captain America serial on DVD,"Great serial plenty of action and cliffhanger suspence, although it's all on one disc and picture isn't too sharp a bit on the grainy side."
5,Captain America,Sorry but there is a mistake here. I have never ordered or received this serial. Sorry about that.
4,"Great serial, unfair reviews","Perhaps I'm seeing a later-generation release of this title, but I found the release to be acceptable. Yes, releasing this title (a 15-chapter serial) on a single DVD-R does create some compression artifacts....but it's far from terrible. My copy has chapter stops for each episode. The source print is rough, but I've never seen a better print for this particular serial. Until Paramount decides to release their vault materials (never) for some of these titles, this is probably about as good as we'll see on DVD."
1,Burned!,"This is not about the program, but rather the actual product. I was really surprised and disappointed about the poor quality of the label on the box. Right away it seemed amateurish. Needless to say, I was even more upset to see that when I opened it, it was a BURNED COPY. Why is Amazon selling burned copies? Luckily it works (so far)."
5,Merry and Bright !,"This little volume only 61/2"" x 7"" is a perfect gift for you to give to some harried person you love that has been scurrying around, shopping, baking, cooking, cleaning, wrapping and decorating to make the holidays wonderful. I suggest you put it on a tray with some hot cocoa (with a candy cane in it) and a couple of those Christmas cookies and serve it up with a kiss BEFORE Christmas Eve. It contains 33 colorful and very funny and endearing paintings of charming animals in zany holiday motiff. You'll love them all but my favorite is a big Polar Bear expectantly puckered up beneath the mistletoe, and I know you'll chuckle when you see the walrus in his Santa suit. The only text is a witty caption beneath each picture so there's no ""work"" to enjoying this book. Maybe throw in a pair of warm slippers when you give this book and stick around to share the smiles."
3,Not as listed,"I think Case Logic changed this case somewhat. I received a CDY64 case, but the front cover now has a curved pattern and DOES NOT HAVE A ZIPPER as stated. It does have the fastfile as stated. As far as the Prosleves, I thought this meant removable but I guess not. The case also looks thicker than it needs to be."
4,"An interesting, intricate alternate history","A rich tapestry of ideas and half-familiar characters, it's witty, and dark, and complex, and I like it a lot. I haven't read the book this is supposedly a sequel to, yet, but I certainly intend to now! I should note, I do tend to enjoy Victorian-flavored alternate history in general (like Phil Foglio's Girl Genius series, which is admittedly MUCH sillier than this). Papal assassins. A countdown to disaster. Massive neat-looking airships, and city streetcars that look like dragonflies ..."
1,Save your dough!,"Better choice ""Your money or your life""! Great nuts and bolts instructions on getting a financial grip."
3,Better Yet,"Suze Orzman has a few valuable lessons to teach, but sends mixed messages. I found a much more readable, deeper (yet practical), healthier, and consistent approach in The Mindful Money Guide. The author of The Mindful Money Guide is a former stockbroker who retired at a young age and then spent the next 15 years honing the art and balance of managing money--so it doesn't manage you. The Mindful Money Guide shows you how to simplify your money life, but it doesn't pretend there are easy answers. Despite the serious sounding title, it's actually a fun read."
2,"Calm Down, Suze","One of the worst audio tapes I've listened to. At times, Suze Orman is yelling each word and it sounds as if each sentence ends in an exclamation mark. It's especially obvious since the tape/book is done in a question & answer style and the people asking the questions are speaking in a normal tone of voice. It's been a few years since I've read her other books, but this seems to be a repeat of previous information, just presented in a question & answer format. It also includes odd advice on personal matters, like dealing with divorce, death of a loved one, etc. I know these are related to financial situations, but I expect Suze Orman to give her opinion on the financial side of a situation, not the emotional side."
1,BORING BORING BORING,Well folks I don't know which is more boring Suze's long-winded response to customer comments or her book. I am happy that I bought this book because it will save me thousands of dollars in sleep aids in the years to come. zzzzzzzzzz Sleep well my friends.
3,Suze gives us courage to be rich!,"I won't say much but the book will help a lot of people who are lost about saving money or spend too much money. Suze's common sense is simple but it comes from personal experiences. I was surprised to learn that her father dropped out of law school to run the family chicken stand business. I knew about Suze's work at the Buttercup Bakery and her life after college. She got screwed when she went to invest $50,000 loaned from good friends to open her own restaurant. Instead, she went into finance and investment at Merrill Lynch in San Francisco and the rest becomes history.She writes about her own losses and mistakes along the way which has infused her with knowledge to correct herself and others from making the same mistakes. This book is to help and assist people in difficult situations."
3,"Useful advice, but overzealous philosophically","Orman provides very helpful and easy-to-understand financial advice. Her theme about financial courage, however, is overly dramatic. She makes her point within a few pages, then proceeds to pound it into your head for the remainder of the book. While not everyone will find all parts of this book useful (ie. divorce, bankruptcy), everyone should be able to find something that will help them make sensible and rewarding financial decisions."
2,Reworking of previous books and TV appearances.,"I agree with the reader from Phoenix, AZ. Orman's previous books had more meat with the potatoes. This book is mostly potatoes. Read her previous books and watch her on TV. She is very knowledgable and there is info in this book also, but, I felt I had read it and heard it before. Of course, if you like potatoes..."
1,Not as good as Koppels MONEY TALKS,"I must agree with the several reviews that cited the excellent book by Robert Koppel on the subject of money,MONEY TALKS.IT is a far more interesting and thought provoking book."
2,Overrated and simplistic,"Ms. Orman treatment of financial matters are rather basic in this book. Only beginners will get much information. Some of the advice is somewhat inaccurate (for example, recommendations on taking on a 15 year morgage)."
2,Outdated Material,"Suze Orman has many good ideas and interesting stories. However when I got to the mortgage and real estate section, (being in the mortgage business for 13 years), I was shocked to see her information was about 10 years old. Which makes me wonder if she's just writing the same book over and over. After seeing her bestsellers and seeing her on public television I was quite disappointed."
4,Great Book for Finacial Starters,If you have no clue about how to get your Finances in order and don't even know what IRA stands for then this is the book for you.Suze explains it all.Get rid of your debt and smartly invest in your future.
3,Good for beginers,Ive seen the video and in it she presents good basic information for those at the beginer level.
1,Delusions of knowing what she is talking about,"Well, I finally read the final chapter of this book last night. The misinformation in the book goes far beyond mere mistakes. There are glaring errors in the book and I don't know who did some of the math but they certainly did not graduate from MIT. The stories that Suze has to convey tell about her own success, but with stories like these there is often more than meets the eye. I wish I could recommend this book, but I can't and I felt like it was not worth my time and effort. Better luck next time Suze, but before you write your next book readers need to ask this question:Do we really need another Suze Orman book that will add to the millions of dollars that she has already made?? The answer has to be No!"
3,O.K. but over simplistic and trite.,This book is not nearly as comprehensive in its treatment of money nor thoughtful as I had hoped.A much better book on the subject of money is Money Talks by Robert Koppel-a truly excellent work.
1,The DUD of the Year,After reading this book I almost wanted to cry. The reason for my sad state is that I realized how much I payed for this book. Thank God I returned it and got my money back.The book is filled with misinformation and there are a number of factual errors as well. This is a result of a rushed job instead of a well thought out project.
1,"Get a clue, Suze","The only person who is getting rich because of this book is Suze Orman. Her tone is condescending, and her advice is patently un-helpful. If you are young and want to learn about investing & how to make smart money decisions, I recommend ""Get a Financial Life"" by Beth Kobliner.The bottom line is that you should make decisions about your money based on sound information, not a bunch of psycho-babble."
1,"This book is nothing but a garbage, and wastage of money","I think, I should have bought 9 steps rather than this COURAGE TO BE RICH. The authors intention was to put stories from her clients as many as she can to increase the size of the book. It is a total wastage of money and I regret to buy this book. I wish I could return that and buy 9 steps. I should not recommend anyone to buy this book. Regards, Tipu"
5,The Courage to Take your Head Out of the Sand.,"I saw this video when it appeared during a PBS Fund Drive. I found Ms. Orman's advice to be practical and inspiring. Although at first blush it seemed a bit ""New Ageish"", after seeing it a second time, I realized that she was merely tying to demonstrate how our emotions are connected to our spending habits. Basically, she recommends good self-esteem and common sense! I can't wait to buy it."
3,Good...but would like more info on investing,"When I purchased the audio of this book, I was expecting to get sound advice from Suze on investing and proper allocation of my money. After listening to the tapes, I feel that a few areas did no meet my expectations. At various points throughout the tape, I felt like most of the ""testimonials"" were from women which got the raw end of the deal by their partner. Then, there was about 20% of the time spent on correctly establishing Pre-Nuptial agreements, how to get the most ""bang for the buck"" in a divorce, and the same for the death of a spouse.The info before and after these chapters was pretty good, but she lost me with the continuous male bashing that was prevelant throughout the book. I would personally have preferred more information on investment strategies. Obviously the audio is different than reading the book, but this is just my $.02"
1,WASTE of TIME and MONEY,P.T. Barnum was right: It's impossible to underestimate what Americans will waste their money on. SUZE BRAGS THAT SHE HAS MADE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS from this and other books and tapes. She is making this money from struggling people (mostly women) who are trying against tough odds to somehow take charge of their finances. Ms. Orman should be ashamed of herself for exploiting these people for her personal gain! Forbes magazines exposed her more than a year ago for the phony and imposter that she really is.
1,Waste of time and money,"The Courage to be Rich should be called the courage to steal. It is a complete waste of the readers time and money. If You must read something by Suze Orman read ""You've earned it,Don't lose it""."
1,Big Con Job!,"What a waste of money. My bridge club bought copies of this book because we were told it was a good investment and would help us take charge of our money. We tried the so-called advice and it did NOT work.We finally had a garage sale and unloaded our copies of this book for $1 each. The person who bought it is using them as doorstops!Forbes Magazine exposed her in their magazine. Read about the ""real"" Suze and how she's lied about her background and even how she lost the lawsuits she claimed that she won. Why take advice from her?"
3,Where's the system?,"Although there are some good ideas in this book, it fails to give us a system we can all use to rich the top.I would suggest a great book which gives you a simple system by which everyone can reach the top. It is ""I'm Rich Beyond My Wildest Dreams. I am. I am. I am."" by Thomas L. Pauley and Penelope J. Pauley"
1,OPPOSITE OF HELPFUL,"That's right. I followed some of the advice in this book and it got me deeper in debt and invested in some mutual funds that I later discovered were totally wrong for me. In desperation, I finally called a nonprofit credit counseling service and they negotiated with my creditors and got my monthly payments reduced by $89 and even got two credit card companies to remove $372 in late charges and finance charges. The counselor did it free of charge and got me real help. This book just spewed useless feel-good slogans."
1,"Trust Yourself, NOT This Absurd Book",Stupid. Goofy. Useless advice that isn't worth the paper it's written on. Use your money for better purposes than this dreadful book.
1,Dangerous Advice From a Self-Centered Woman,"Your advice doesn't work but that hasn't stopped you from scaring women into buying your worthless books, tapes and calendars. You should feel guilty about taking money from women who are barely getting by. But you just keep scamming new women instead. Suze it's time for you to fade into the darkness and the sooner the better."
1,The Courage to be Poor,Just imagine if you had the courage to put your money into the qqq in 99 in the wholesale fashion which this author suggests.
5,An Excellent primer,"My wallet has been like a sieve for most of my life. No small thanks to one parent's exceptionally poor money handling ways.However, this book gives me hope, on every page. Suze Orman writes with a clear, concise, reader-friendly style and gets her financial wisdom across without using unintelligible terminology, for which I am eternally grateful.And -- if the only page in this book was the page on the Five Laws of Life, I would still give this book 5 stars."
5,The courage to be rich is practical and down-to-earth,"Suze Orman is a woman with abundant endownment of knowledge. This book is a real practical book, easy to understand and follow as Suze walks you through the chapters. The various practical stories are real life examples of the laxities in our everyday life. The book reveals that a person's destiny is actually in is hands and that each of us are our individual enemies blocking our individual fortunes. I would like to read the book ten more times."
5,Lessons on Abundance,"In THE COURAGE TO BE RICH, Suze Orman reminds us just how spiritual our relationship to money is. She reminds us how our past views impose upon present realities determining our ability to open ourselves to more abundance or the lack thereof. Thanks, Suze, for writing a book that is both practical in its applications and revelational in the way our soul manifests material reality from the infinite correlations we place our attention upon. -- Samuel Oliver, author of, WHAT THE DYING TEACH US: LESSONS ON LIVING."
1,"Boring, I couldn't wait to finish it!","I'm sorry but I dont like this series at all so far, I've read Melody, Heart Song, and I'm reading Unfinished Syphony right now. I find myself hating Melody so much she is such a good-two-shoes. She wont do anything bad, she wont cause anyone and trouble. It pisses me off. I find so many things the same with this series and the dollanganger, casteel and cutler series. It's getting old. I recemend that you dont read this book or any other logan books. I havt read the last two and i heard they are better then the books with melody so i might end up reading them. I just hate Melody's character!!"
2,Predictable,"Nothing too exciting about this book. Pretty predictable if you've ever read any other V.C. Andrews series. Also not a fan of 2nd cousins being in an intimate relationship. Boring read, but I'm the type of person who has to finish a book, even if it's painfully boring. Was glad to finally get to the end."
2,Eh,"This book was alright. Not the best one in the series, but I think it still gave some insight about the lead character, Melody. The one thing that's always bothered me about V.C. Andrews is that I don't think she ever makes clear what time frame she's writing about. I can probably guess, but I know I won't be right. I assume Melody is set during the 70's or early 90's. I can only imagine that Laura is written during the late 50s or early 60s just because of how strict her bible wielding father is. Plus he was always adamant about praying before eating and reading the bible and who Laura could date. I don't think that kind of parenting is common these days, but I could be wrong."
2,Like I've never seen this before,"This is basically a Harlequin romance for teens. Many hot love scenes are portrayed in disgusting detail. It's definitely melodramatic and unbelievable. Very mindless. Heck, *I* could have written the plot for this book!"
3,the long awaited book arrives...,"After waiting what for seemed like forever, the book finally came out. I had very high expectations for it after reading all the other books in the ""Once Upon A Time"" series, but they were quickly crushed as the book progressed. I didn't like it at all. She abandoned her people (the English) and lived with the Native Americans on her own free will. I think that is so wrong. Yeah, the guy saved her life about twice, but that is no reason to abandon her religion, suddenly leave her father and her people. She basically does nothing while her people die. Throughout the book, she is torn between the Natives and the English. You can't be loyal to both!!In conclusion, do not read this book. It is not a good book."
1,Terrible.,"I was REALLY looking forward to this book. I enjoyed several others from this series, as well as other books by Nancy Holder, and I love colonial American settings. Boy, was I disappointed. First off, the book claims to be a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, but I could find only the barest hints of that story. Secondly, I found the love story completely unbelievable. I never felt that these two characters loved each other or could be happy together. And the ending came out of nowhere and was just totally bizarre and made very little sense. All in all, I can't find anything to recommend in this book."
2,"too much violence, not enough fun.","Spirited: Knowing that it was a smash up of the last of the Mohicansand beauty & the beast might help going into it, but then again...not so much. Lots of violence. Lots of blood thristy men.blech ! Then they throw in leprechauns!!!The story was drawn out and pretty strange.***SPOILER****Not sure how the reader is supposed towarm up to a hero who is a scary violent savage... was married,had a child & lost them in a horrific slaughter.Y'know it doesn't matter if he's good looking...unless you're the kind who goes for the creepy, dark brooding typePass on this. I'm giving up on this author !"
3,powerfull percussion real steel,"Pan showdown is my fav on this Cd, although he is in fine company.Ray and pan go hand in hand smoothtouch@onthebreez.com"
1,Will be throwing this away,"Not only are the element boxes severely cluttered due to the (oh so politically correct) labeling in a handful of languages, there are basic grammatical issues with the chart. The legend is labeled ""Legenda"". The approach to capitalization is perhaps appropriate to some language, but that language is not English.Because everything is labeled in five language, the mnemonic properties of the chart are reduced and diluted. An English-speaking child has to consciously ignore 4/5th of the printed text. This thing is an absurdity and going into the trash."
3,Blocks other outlet,"As a warning, when used with a standard, 2-outlet wall box, this surge protector will block both outlets in all scenarios."
5,Excellent single power protection,Ordered for a TV in den - to separate from all PC etc - Plugged into bottom of outlet and theMaxxima MLN-10 LED Night Light with Sensor (Pack of 4)fits perfectly secure in the top outlet slot.Will be getting more of these as well as sensors for friends who have and travel with laptops -Not utilizing the phone line function as not needed.
4,"It's a surge protector, I hope I never have to find out that it doesn't work.","It's a surge protector, I hope I never have to find out that it doesn't work.Supposedly has protection for power, ground, and neutral. I bought it for my new laptop to be protected. Good cheap surge protector. A bunch of different people selling the same thing at different prices on Amazon, make sure to get the cheap one, they are all the same!"
5,Little Phone Lifesaver,"These little marvels have saved many a phone for me. They are quite simple and relatively inexpensive when you consider how much it costs to replace a phone these days (or finding one you like as well as the one that's broke). When we have lightning storms I try to unplug everything but sometimes I'm not at home or don't take the storm seriously enough until I hear that familiar ""ding"" on the phoneline. When I do, after the storm I replace the surge protector and I'm up and running again. Keep two or three on hand so you are never without. A little tip: When the phoneline is fried, the electric part still works so if your phone is still functional but no dial tone, check your Belkin MasterCube before calling the phone company!"
1,Just right! OOPS! See change in review. Don't trust Belkin!,"Received 2 days before expected delivery. Surge protecters are just right for my purpose. One on each of telephone and modem connections. Right size for my purposes.Oops! ordered 6-27-2011 and installed upon receipt. One was installed on cordless base station/answering machine. Had a electrical spike yesterday (7-15-2011) and base station fried. Surge protectors indicator lights show everything still working! Having to replace cordless phone system (base with 6 remotes). Manufacturer, Panasonic, says it is outdated model. Costing me about $150 or so.Don't trust Belkin at all now."
2,Not for use with 2-line phones,"Seems to work fine, but its not clear from the description that it only protects 1 line, not all 4 pins of an RJ-11 phone cable."
4,No problems work good,"I bought 4 of these at one time to get the free shipping. I live in Florida where these are a must! Not to mention I also have two whole house surge breakers. I put one on the refrigerate, microwave, printer, etc.; everything else has a battery back up (UPS)"
4,Well built,"This product is solidly built and comes with good written information. It also has 2 warning lights, one for power and one for surge protection. It also has a line for the phone cord. It plugs into the wall solidly and other items plug into it solidly. It comes with a generous guarantee, although you have to read the fine print to discover that if a given device (e.g. TV) does not also have separate surge protection for the cable, the warranty is void. No lightening strikes yet so I can't tell you how well it protects against surges."
4,Works fine - but one failed when plugged in,We bought 5 of these devices - max allowed by Amazon. 4 worked fine (and are still doing fine after2 months) but one failed as soon as we plugged it in. Smell of burned wiring came of the device.Asked for and received a replacement ASAP from Amazon.
3,"works, but bulky-may not fit in all plugs","Works, but ""wide & bulky"". May not work for restricted spaces. Takes up both plugs, esp older ones. Plan on using 1 outlet"
1,Belkin Mastercube F9H120-CW 1-Outlet Wall-Mount Surge Protector,Lousy product. I used it to protect my refrigerator outlet. It didn't last more than 1 minute and the product smell burnt and stopped working. I don't recommend this product to any body. Poor quality. Fire hazzard.
1,voltage,"i purchased 2 units for laptop use when traveling. i found it handy, and cheap.the problem is that its only 110V which should be ""auto volt or 100-250v""i'm disappointed because i can't use it in asia like the Philippines for 240v and japan 100V."
4,Good Family Movies,"4 Original Nancy Drew movies on 1 DVD. Each run around 65 minutes. A little suspencful and some good laughter. Nancy is somewhat modern minded refering to women needing to have a career and she does disobey her father. The disobedience does get her in trouble each time. Ted (Ned) provides the laughter always getting involved in Nancy's schemes. Not perfect, but still fun to watch."
3,Delightful Family Fare,Good family entertainment. Bonita Granville is cute and funny. I recommend this for any family or person who desires an alternative to the junk coming out of Hollywood and TV today.
3,Nancy Drew Mystery?,Another Nancy Drew mystery? I guess it wasn't all that I thought it could have been....the discs weren't well put together and two of the movies actually pixalated on me...doubtful if I will try Nancy Drew again any time soon!
3,Remember--it's black and white,"My 8 year old grand-daughter was disappointed that the movies weren't in color. Also, they are so dated that she didn't understand some of the references."
5,Good Saturday afternoon fun,"I adore the films in this collection. Bonita Granville has such vivacity that it's easy to see why the people around her help her out, including her ever patient neighbor. He is great as a supporting character. I wish there were more than four movies with the cast in these movies. You feel like Nancy and her father really like each other, even outside the movies."
5,Nancy Drew,"I bought the Original Nancy Drew collection. I really like the whole collection. they were made in the 30's. It goes back to the simple time of no blood, no bad language, no sex. just a collection of simple mysteries that are fun stories. My mom is in her 80's and she really enjoyed them too. She also liked the simple stories, seeing the old cars and going back to the good old days."
3,"Light, fun mystery from the old days","Sweet, fun Nancy Drew mysteries from the old days. One of these not good reproduction...that's why not as good a review. A good classic video set to add to your library."
4,Great Combination of Classics,"The songs on this albulm are great. If you don't have WOW 2003, then definately get this. The only reason this isn't five stars is that some of the songs you always see on every Dove/Wow or any other contemporary christian album:4.) He Reigns - Newsboys6.) You Are So Good To Me - Third Day14.) All About Love - Steven Curtis Chapman18.) The Valley Song (Sing of Your Mercy) - Jars of Clay(this song is all over the place)"
4,"""Kids in the Hall""","If you ever watched the old Kids in the Hall show, the theme song was written by these guys. It's on this album known as ""Having an Average Weekend"". Savvy Show Stoppers is a great collection of surf guitar instrumentals all in the spirit of ""Having an Average Weekend.Orginal rhythms permeate the album, but there isn't a lot variation on the songs. They're all about the same pace. Think of this as a surf guitar jam album. It's just the band jamming away on slightly different rhythms. Somehow it doesn't detract from the album's appeal though."
3,easy to read...,"I had to read this book for a grad. course.C. Hill is a great writer, and the book is very easy to follow. However, while his contributions to English history are certainly there, Hill's Marxist view of history certainly has hurt his work. The argument that Henry VIII's rebellion against the papacy created a rebellious spirit in the english people that ultimately led to the English Civil War, is short sighted. It can be argued, as M. Walzer argues, that the nature of Calvinism created a different approach to politics, or a revolutionary one. The way Calvinists percieved the world and their position in it certainly effected the English political culture during the 17thc. However, while this may have some truth, the idea that everything that happened in tyhe 1640s is purely based off Henry's opposition to the papacy needs to be re-worked. And, it has been re-worked by well post-marxists historians or what we would call post-Hillian approahces to English history."
3,Simple and Easy,Good wholesome (smut free) reading. Recommended if you want a vacation from the real world-- escape into the world of the Amish.
1,Bad Pump,"This pump was defective upon receipt. But, I damaged the plug a little, so didn't feel it was returnable. It was only $10, but it was a bad product that didn't work."
5,Wonderful pump,This is an excellent quality pump and certainly a very good price. Easily installed and worked fine. Far better than any I could fine at the local hardware stores.
2,too noisy!,I have this pump in a small outdoor fountain. It was quiet for about 3 minutes and now makes more noise than the running water. Very distracting. The water is filtered to keep debris out of the pump.
3,It works well......but...,"I ordered this pump to use in a small outside faux rock fountain when the original pump died after a year. The pump works pretty well, but not always quietly. It takes a few minutes to ""warm "" up when first turned on and makes a fairly loud noise but then becomes quiet and stays that way for the duration it is on."
2,Best of two similar options,"EDITED TO ADD:This thing died after 2 months. It couldn't manage a comeback after the fountain went dry a couple of times. I drop it to 2 stars rather than 5.**************************************************************I just bought this Sunterra 109006 and aSTI Aquatics Infinity 75 gph Magnetic Drive Submersible Pump Kit With 6-Foot Cable. Both are adjustable to 75 gph and both are about the same price, shipping free with Amazon Prime. This Sunterra outperformed the Aquatics Infinity by 50% in our kitchen sink.SUNTERRA:- 11 seconds to fill a pint sized mug- A little more noisy than the Aquatics Infinity- Adjustable dial was more solid.STI AQUATICS INFINITY- 16 seconds to fill a pint sized mug- A little quieter than the Aquatics Infinity- Adjustable dial was loose, giving the impression that it could change position while in use.Both were about the same size. The Sunterra also pushed out a slightly higher stream, perhaps 5 inches rather than 4."
2,"Good while it lasted, but it didn't last very long.","We bought this pump for our birdbath fountain. It was great -- at its highest setting it spewed water like a geyser (which looked awesome but was counter-intuitive to getting birds to use the fountain.) At a medium setting it was perfect. It may have been a little noisy, but the birdbath is far enough away from our home that it didn't bother us, and it definitely didn't bother the birds because they'd play around in it like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately, although I kept it clean and kept the birdbath full, it completely died about 9 months after first using it. I know fountains often don't last too long, but it's still frustrating that it didn't even last a year.I threw it away and bought theLittle Giant PES-80-PW 77 GPH Statuary Fountain Pump, which I installed this week. So far that one's working great, but I'm going to wait for the 1-year mark, or until it dies, to give my final opinion."
2,Pump works but cheap material,"what can I really say about this pump. It does its job, but the material on the pump seems cheap. The connection piece that connects the pump to a tube broke off on me the first time I used it. Sure it came with 2 pieces but they are different sizes which means you're going to replace the tube too! So at the end of the day, the pump does work, does what is needed, but the connection pieces are cheap!"
5,great little pump,Great pump for the price. I have started building several small fountains around the property using half-barrels and yard-sale items. This pump is efficient and inexpensive.
2,Fountain pump,"I should have purchased a larger pump. This pump only lifts about 2 feetSunterra 109006 Small Fountain Pump, 75 GPH, Black"
1,"Lousy pressure, extremely noisy","Spend a little more money and get a better pump. Like the old saying goes, you get what you pay for! This pump does not have the lift it states and it's so noisy you can't hear the water. Very disappointed with this product and it's being returned!"
5,An Icon of the Industrial Revolution,"""The World of Eli Whitney"" by Jeannette Mirsky is an outstanding primer on the early days of the Industrial Revolution and its key players. Mirsky draws heavily on Whitney's correspondence and papers, and much of the text is in either Whitney's or his correspondents' own words. Well-developed, it will hold the reader's attention and provides enough detail to give a full scope of Whitney's life and his pioneering transformation of the world's manufacturing process (the 1793 invention of the cotton gin being only a decade long distraction) without being burdensome. Pictures of equipment, more sketches, and factory layouts would have added to this otherwise excellent work. Well-researched and documented."
1,This stinks for the price,"This item advertised that it held most 7inch screen DVD players. I bought Polaroid brand for my kids for Christmas. Unless you only want to carry the player itself and one unprotected DVD (Cases don't fit in the compartment for DVDs), forget it. The only other accessory that does fit it the remote which isn't of much use when traveling since the player isn't far from you. This case is a total waste in my opinion and I was very disenchanted. I would recommend buying a case specifically made by the company that made the DVD player that you purchased.My whole reasoning for buying a case was so that my kids wouldn't lose all of the components and they don't fit in this one so I defeated my purpose altogether. I guess they can use them for gameboys or short travel."
2,Disappointed,"The cover of this book is beautiful, but the contents weren't even close to what I anticipated after reading the back cover. This is not a ""psychic techniques"" book. Not in comparison with the other books of the same subject. 85% of this book is the author giving his opinions which are not revelatory or insightful. They are ""old news"". I felt if this book had been written in the 1970's it might have been more popular. It also seemed as if this book was written for complete skeptics that have no knowledge of the paranormal or metaphysical. If you have ever read any book on developing your psychic abilities, I would definitely skip this one. If you have no knowledge of psychic senses and metaphysical / paranormal subjects, then you might enjoy this book."
1,Only Thing Related to Psychic is Chakras Here,"The only thing related about developing psychic abilities is about opening the chakras. However, many books out there do a better job than this one. Looks more like the author got his psychic abilities through a traumatuc childreen rather than chakra development. Read the book and you'll see what I mean.Borrow from the library if you are curious but I wouldn't buy this book."
1,The Worst Book on Psychic Development,This is the worst book on the subject of psychic development because you won't learn such things from it. Clearly a waste of paper.
3,LEARN TO SING!!!,"This ""Viking Metal"" band has some of the best and most creative music I've heard. Traditional scandinavian melodies crossed with Monowar style metal. The occasional use of acoustic instruments is a pleasant touch, also. Too bad the ""vocals"" have to ruin the whole thing! The Black metal ""singing"" does not go well against melodic metal- especially when it's this imaginative. And it's not like it's hard to sing here- the chours back ground vocals prove that. To hear some great Swedish Viking Rock where they actually carry a tune check out Frostfodd, Ultima Thule, Dirlewanger, Hel, Enherjarna, and Midgaard Soner."
1,not a great product at all,"I decided to give this new product a try the past couple weeks, and after trying it one more time today, I poured the rest of the bottle out. Even the SMALLEST application makes the hair much harder to comb out than usual, which is really not good when trying to comb out wet, easier-to-break-than-when-dry hair. (I don't get much hair breakage so I'm very sensitive about any new product that leaves my comb full of hair). The rest of the Anti-breakage line is okay-didn't notice a major change one way or another-but DO NOT use this leave-in. Try smooth n shine extreme repair (in the tiny bottles) instead. Got my hair from bob to shoulder length using SnS on the regular."
2,only of academic & historical value,"Even though the story is still fascinating, the 1931 verison of the Opera is NOT brought well to the screen. Compared with other movies from the time, some of the characters seem very flat, especially Mr. Peachum's wife. Even Mack the Knife is not the character, Brecht intended. He and the great composer K.Weill were right to leave the production before it was completed.Nevertheless a must for film historians."
2,SONGS OF SAC/SONGS OF SEA,"I WAS IN CONTACT WITH BULL DURHAM WAY BACK WHEN. AT THAT TIME I GOT COPIES OF ""SONGS OF SEA"" AND ""SONGS OF SAC"" ON AUDIO TAPE. I HAVE BEEN EAGERLY AWAITING THE RELEASE OF THESE SELECTIONS ON C/D. THEY ARE GREAT. TELLING THE STORY OF OUR MEN IN THE ARMED SERVICES IN SOMETIMES SOMBER BUT USUALLY HUMOUROUS AND ALWAYS ACCURATE AND ENTERTAINING SONG. I CANNOT BEGIN TO EXPRESS MY EXCITEMENT AT LEARNING I CAN NOW HAVE THESE SONGS ON C/D. I VERY HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS SELECTION TO ANYONE EVEN REMOTELY INTERESTED IN AVIATION AND THE ARMED FORCES, VERY ENTERTAINING. THANK YOU ""AMAZON FOR"" FOR MAKING THIS SELECTION AVAILABLE AND THANK YOU BULL DURHAM FOR IT'S CREATION. GOD BLESS OUR MEN IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY GOD BLESS AMERICA."
4,Supenseful and well acted,"The cast elevates this 3-star movie to 4 stars. Patrick Stewart, always a tour de force in the acting department, takes command of his role as the intelligent operations manager/mediator who nonetheless underestimates his opponent. Pierce Brosnan, who always brings a human vulnerability to his heroism, slips into James Bond mode. Alexandra Paul does a credible job of portraying a sharpshooter whose raw determination is matched by her female intuition. Ted Levine is flawless as the cocky mercenary. And Christopher Lee nails his role as the Russian evildoer. The performance of these actors is not wasted. The film is intelligent and suspenseful. I cannot fault the direction or camerawork. The soundtrack is understated, so that the film is more ""real world"" than ""dramatic."" DETONATOR is a good film, and its solid cast of actors makes it worth a repeat viewing."
3,Detonator OR is it just Det-On-Actor,"The movie is full of action of guns, shooting, and suspense, yet it lacks the feel of a good action movie. Of general feeling, it could have been made better. Why would I write - Det-On Actor becuase it was just that Det-On of Acting ofPatrick Stewart and Bronson. Everthing was predictiable and of course nothing worked to stop the train till the end of the movie. I would rather wait till you can rent it than buy it and spend the money."
1,More wooden than a forest of trees,Don't waste your time!This movie was boring.I'm not even going to waste time on a review.Gone already ...
1,Boring,"The Detonator was quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever had the unfortunate oppurtunity to watch. Not to mention the most dullest. The acting was horrible, the dialoge weak, and everyone ran around like a chicken with its head cut off. I found myself rooting for Christpher Lee just to pull the plug, and explode the darn bomb.Nothing went right, and the entire experience made you come away with the feeling that you could have done a better job, had the director merely handed the script over. Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother renting this movie, the time spent over it is definatly not a good way to spend those precious minutes of your life."
1,The MOST HORRIBLE MOVIE EVER MADE!,"This ""action"" movie was quite frankly the WORST movie I have ever seen. The dialog was completely predictable, the plot was basically non-existant (a Soviet general wants to send a nuclear bomb to Iraq to make the Russians invade it and restore the USSR... huh?), the acting was a step below Jake Lloyd's (I'm shocked that Patrick Steward would even consider appearing in such a cheesy flick), and even the ""action"" was pathetic; a few gunshots on a rusty train. Oh, and don't look for the soundtrack--it was composed on the director's Apple II. Save yourself the agony; don't watch ""Detonator!"""
1,Not worth the purchse,"I saw no health improvements whatsoever. Like taking a placebo, save your money. Eat clean and get in some daily exercise."
1,BAD!!!,"The reason why I gave it a 1 because it gave me the worse menstral cramps, and I was in pain for a week. I don't recommend this product!!"
4,I think it works ...,"I feel better than before I started taking the pills. I suggest buying a bottle and take as directed. Then half way through the bottle, stop taking them for a week or two and see if symptoms return..."
2,Not for me,"Gave me headaches every day for a couple weeks. I stopped using it and the headaches went away. Over all, it's not for me."
5,DIM-Plus really works!!!,"I started taking this product after hearing a friend comment on how much it has helped her menopausal symptoms. Prior to beginning this product I had all the typical symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness) and fatigue as well. I took the max dose and after 3 weeks of taking the product I started to notice a change with my symptoms lessening. NOW, I do not have the hot flashes, night sweats and yes, even my mood has improved. I do feel I have more energy as well. This is definitely worth a try!!! I can't say it will work for everyone but it has certainly worked for me!!!!!"
5,Excellent Relief from Menopausal Symptons,"After one day of use I stopped having hot flashes, night sweats and actually slept through the night for once in three months!! I have re-ordered Dim-Plus. I've tried other natural supplements that did nothing to relieve the hot flashes, night sweats and sleepless nights. I feel the ""brain fog"" has gone away also. I'm 54 and just started experiencing menopausal symptons and wanted to use natural supplements vs HRT. Dim-Plus works for me!!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I really didn't notice any difference. I did order Green Coffee Bean Extract and noticed a real difference. For weight loss, pre-menopausal, this would not be my choice for weight loss :("
1,title is misleading this is for 60 capsule only!!!,"Title reads: DIM-Plus by Nature's Way - 120 Capsulesnow, how many capsules do you think you'll receive? yes, there's an option for 1 or 60, but when I'm ordering off an ad that titles itself ""120 capsules,"" I think that reads 1 or 60 bottles.CHANGE THE TITLE!!!"
4,Best Deal I found,The price at Amazon was the best deal I found for this product and I'm very pleased with it. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the length of time it took to get to me (4 weeks + even though they stated 10 to 18 days.)
4,Amazon Verified Purchase,"I ordered this product as described on Amazon.Com as I had read that it could possibly help with Enlarged Prostate issues as well as hair loss. At this time, it is too early to tell if this product will address some of those concerns, but I can state that the product came in a timely manner and as described. I am and have always been very pleased with Amazon's products, delivery and customer service. I would have rated this a 5 star, but it is too early to tell the results."
2,Dim,Not really sure if's working or not. I'll keep taking until I run out. I may update later on if things change.
2,Didn't help bring a cycle,I read about this possibly helping bring your cycle back if you're not regular. I used up the whole bottle and never got a cycle with this. That is all I used it for.
3,No sure yet!,This product doesn't seem to work as effectively as another product that I've taken. I will finish the 2 bottles that I have and re-evaluate it later. So far I'm not impressed.
3,Semi satisfied,Took a while to ship out. When I did finally receive package it was tore open and smashed. Box was completely damaged. Bottle wasn't damaged luckily.
5,DIM really helps!,"I can feel this product work in my body as it keeps my system humming along at a smooth, consistent pace."
5,What a wonderful life with DIM!,"I lived in an Asian country for years and I realized that the diet there (high in soy protein) can cause a lot of unexpected problems. What people don't know about soy protein (tofu, soy foods), is that soy turns into (excess) estrogen in the body. Once I returned from overseas, I purchased DIM to regulate my periods, and I am still having the same bloodflow but NO PAIN AT ALL!!!! I am not sure whether this is because of DIM, stopping the soy diet, or BOTH!"
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I've been searching for a cookbook that would help me re-create some of the amazing home-cooked food I had while traveling through Thailand and the dishes I ate at wonderful and very authentic Southeast Asian restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. This cookbook is not it.I've tried a number of the Thai, Cambodian, and Vietnamese recipes in this book, and found all but one to be uninteresting and lacking in flavor, sometimes seemingly due to the cookbook's directions (for example, directing you to simmering pineapple in a soup for 10 minutes, when all other versions of the same soup I've had very briefly cook the pineapple so it remains flavorful). Perhaps the recipes from other countries are better, but for me the search for a Southeast Asian cookbook continues."
5,Gift for my carpenter husband - loved it!,this was a gift for my carpenter husband... his coworkers are always asking him where he got it. It has been holding up for over 6 months now and it gets some serious use. He works in arctic conditions so it is exposed to constant use and harsh weather... a solid buy.
1,DO NOT BUY,"Unless you want broken tools do not buy this item. The clip will not stay on your belt, the bungee balls will not stay in the clip, and all three straps I received broke within 2 weeks after purchase. The only satisfaction this product gave me was when I smashed it into a thousand pieces with my hammer after my drill fell out of it for the last time."
2,It's OK....but,"The idea seems alright but the tool, especially a heavier tool like a drill, bounces in the bungee when you walk. The plastic belt clip also feels like it digs into your waist. The big lug hook is better because you don't have to search for the holder (especially while wearing a coat) like with this one although the hook is a pain sometimes because it tends to catch on things when it is empty. The big lug 2 obviously does not have this problem.All in all, it's ok but the bouncy tool thing is the worst part of it."
4,Using for water bottles as well as tools,"Works reasonably well, but I wish it would snap in place more easily - and at the same time, I wish it would stay in the socket more reliably. In other words, it works, but it has limitations."
4,INTERESTING!,REALLY like this. Has several points of view...from the Mayan calendar...to the I Ching....to computer calculatoins and others. Just flat out interezting. The only thing I did not like was the heavy metal music selection. What a let down on that aspect.
2,2012 Mayan Prophecy,The reviews usually help me decide on a book or movie and the reviews were good so I purchased this movie. My advice to anyone is DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! This movie is terrible the men speaking in it put me to sleep! This is a subject that I am very interested in but I could not keep my eyes open! very boring! If you want to hear some truth about 2012go to the Kryon web site Channeled by Lee Caroll and download all the audio and written information you want FOR FREE!!!!!!!!!
3,Who in the hell did the soundtrack?,I mean it might just be me but metal doesn't inspire trust in the film. In my honest opinion the movie may be good but i'll never know do to the lame mismatched music that keeps distracting from the theme...
1,2012: Mayan Prophecy and the Shift of the Ages,"This video was a waste of my money. The information was not based on science, nor was it a true documentary about Mayan culture and prophecy."
4,A great mix!,"This cd is really interesting. The bossa nova tones give to the beatles songs a unique elegancy and pleasant softness. Some outstanding tracks are ""The fool on the Hill"", ""And I love her"", and ""The long and winding road"". Buy this cd, it is really a must for everyone who likes listening beatles songs from a different perspective."
3,In and outs!,"The word that better would qualify this album is lack of vision.There are admirable versions (such Eleanor Rigby, Don't let me down or Yesterday) but many others themes are played without sense of expression.That's why this album is so uneven. I would recommend it just in case you are a big fan of the Beatles."
3,"Black Cherry Concentrate good, Flavor not so good","I decided to try this as less expensive alternative to Knudsen Just Black Cherry Juice.I will be trying a different Black Cherry Juice concentrate, because this concentrate does have a bit of a cough syrup flavor. I can stand it, but I do not look forward to drinking it like the Knudsen juices, both regular and concentrate."
3,Packing,"This is the second shipment of this item. The critique that I have is concerning the packingof these shipments. Both shipments had leakage of the Cherry juice into the box. These bottlesare plastic and were laid on their sides with other items on top. They could have been individuallybubble wrapped which might have helped. UPS is not gentle with their handling of materialand if liquids aren't properly packed, there will be problems."
2,Cherry juice,This brand is not as good as another brand I tried. It's not as concentrated and doesn't have that right cherry flavor. I'll go back to the other when this is gone.
3,Unsure of the benefits,I was recommended this product to deal with arthritis and joint pain. I used the product for 3 weeks going through 4 bottles.It taste pleasantIt is easy to useI felt no benefit at allI suffer from fibromyalgia and it is possible for someone suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or other joint inflammation this would work quite well.
2,Not Much Help when needed,"I don't take this on a regulare basis, but when I had a flare up this product didn't help at all. I ended up having to usew another Black Cherry juice, that wasn't a concentrate, that I purchased from a local Grocery store to releave the pain."
2,Strong artificial smell and taste,"The bottle says ""100% pure"", and ""Ingredients: Black Cherry Juice Concentrate"", but when I opened the bottle and tasted the product, there is a strong artificial smell and taste. Probably, some chemicals or some kind of extract is added.Black Cherry concentrates from other companies have no such taste and smell."
4,FEEL GOOD!!! I BELIEVE IN 100% BLACK CHERRY CONCENTRATE.,"I BELIEVE IN 100% BLACK CHERRY CONCENTRATE BECAUSE IT IS A FEEL GOOD, AMAZING, DELICIOUS, ENERGETIC, GLORIOUS, HEALTHY, NATURAL, POSITIVE, POWERFUL, PURE, REFRESHING, SIMPLE, SWEETENER, TASTE GREAT, WONDER. I LIKE IT BEST IN GREEN TEA AND IN COLD WATER. THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND THE SELLER GIVES GREAT SERVICE IN A WHOLENESS AND WONDERFUL WAY, WORTHY OF YOUR TRUST. I MUST ADD CONTROL IS THE KEY TO BALANCE, OVER YOUR BODIESLIMIT OF THE CONCENTRATE MAY RESULT IN GAS, SO I ADD MORE WATER OR LESS CONCENTRATE.....P.E.A.C.E."
2,Totally annoying me please some ships well,"It's really annoying I tried to order one of the four was completely smashed, this finisher shipping long reader's products also come in crush one too in the annoying breaking down the deserted Street and Arthur return to eat the rest."
5,juice,Tasty! It's on my re-order list along with the cranberry and tart cherry juice. You won't be disappointed.
3,IT DON'T WORK FOR ME,"Taste good, but does not relieve my chronic gout. My metabolism does NOT synthesize uric acid, so gout is a problem no matter what I eat or don't eat. Maybe I need to drink the whole bottle at one time? I don't know."
3,could I be wrong,"Blk cerry juice is supposed to aid in the aches and pains of joints, although not terrible tasting when mixed with water, it does taste like cough syrup. Has it helped my joint pain, too early to tell, maybe someone using this long term can testify. but I will keep taking my cough syrup water"
3,Good Family Movie,"This is warm,light-hearted movie with some good acting by Nichelle Nichols,James Coburn,and Cuba Gooding Jr. While the plot was plausible at best. It is a kid movie you will love."
4,A Little in the Cold,"Snow Dogs was cute, and even a little funny, but it basically could have been so much better. Cuba Gooding Jr. shows a great performance, but it was a little long and drawn out. Yes, it was pretty comical, and I did enjoy it, and you will probably too, but I have seen funnier movies. A funny one, but a little in the cold."
2,a sNOw good movie,"Funny and entertaining - yes, but very predictable and a bit too unbelievable.I do think the movie does a good job in conveying the different personalities of the dogs. But all togther, it's kind of weak, and before it ended my intrest was melting. Seen it once and that was enough, it's one of those kind of movies."
2,Slow Dogs,"This movie is very slow moving. You just want to push it along. It is a good film for younger children around 8-14, but I would not recommend it for adults. It is a usual love story, where the guy gets the girl at the end. There are some cute scenes with the dogs winking at each other and the lead dog (Demon)showing he is the boss. The whole plot of the movie was a Dentist(adopted boy) who inherited his real mothers home in a small Alaskin town. Then wanting to know who is real father was and seeking information on why he was given up for adoption. I did smile at a few places in the film but overall was glad when it ended."
2,Cheesy and Umimpressed,"My family was not happy with this movie. Personally, I fell asleep during the film, my youngest seemed uninterested and couldn't follow the film, and the rest of my family thought it was okay but not really impressed. I am usually not a complainer but this movie didn't meet up to our expectations!"
3,Funny but inaccurate,We don't have skunks here in Alaska. Cuba is a natural comedian. Silly movie. Great for kids.
3,Kids will love it!,"This is the kind of movie that I would never watch before I had kids. Sure, it's a bit corny, kind of silly, and the plot is predictable. But does that matter to my 3 year old? No way. She adores this movie. I had to go out and get her a stuffed ""snow dog"" after she saw this and it has been her constant companion ever since. She always asks for this movie and it's entertaining enough that I can sit through it without cringing. I might even find myself laughing here and there. True family fare. We're happy to have it in our collection."
4,Hilarious Family from Disney!,"Again, Disney has made a family classic for the whole family. Cuba plays Ted Brooks, a Miami dentist, that learns he is aopted when he is served to attend the reading of his biological mother's will in a small Alaska town. On arrival, he runs into his mother's champion Sled Dogs. Espically the lead dog, who gives him a serious bad time. On top of this, the local legend, Thunder Jack, harrasses him of wanting the dogs. When things couldn't get worse, he finds out that Thunder Jack is indeed his father! To proove that he isn't some city slicker that's out of his league, he tries to learn the sport!I got a kick of all the adventures this poor character goes through in learning how to ride a sled, and the bad time the dogs give him. The dogs don't talk though, that was just a dream scene. This is filled with physical humor, and jockes that will give you a good time. It also has a touching story and a happy ending that makes this enjoyable for everyone!"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!,"I am writing this review to spare you the pain of watching this movie. No one should have to go through this kind of agony. I would rather shoot myself in the foot with a BB gun than watch this piece of garbage again. Not funny AT ALL, stupid, and unoriginal. All this kiddie flik (and I stress KIDDIE) is a series of over-exaggerated screams. Olease, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE for yourself or your kids, I mean dear goodness!!!!!!!My grade: F"
3,Makes Fun of Canadians!,"Even though this movie takes place in Alaska it still insults canadians. In the line where Teddy's mom says to a car driver ""I'm so sorry but all I have is American money"" she probably thinks she's in canada because it's snowing. Same with one of Teddy's dreams where he thinks he lives in an Igloo. Canadians don't live in Igloos! Like some gey people think on ""This hour has 22 minutes"". We live in half diesent 2 story homes and those people aren't called Eskimos anymore their called Inuits. We don't get blizzards and 30 below zero weather every winter. And we have 35 degree summers. And we don't always say ""Eh"" in are phrases. Although this movie is entertaining in some parts it still has those questionable parts. Including that Cuba Gooding got killed almost 100 times and still survived. When he flies through a forest he goes straight down the hill and it seems he just ghosts through the trees. Besides that this movie is a very humerous comedy."
1,Yellow Snow,"What is Disney thinking? DVD is for the movie lover. The movie lover wants to see his DVD's in the original aspect ratio, not this pan and .... This could have been the greatest movie ever (ok, maybe not) and the DVD would still be ruined by not being in Widescreen. I hope this does not become a trend by Disney or anyone else...as long as its only the lousy movies."
1,"NO! NO! NO! BAD DOG! BAD, VERY BAD!",Disney thinks people do not like the black bars. Tell them you want widescreen by not buying Snow Dogs! I won't buy it and I telling everyone not to get it.
5,MY DAUGHTERS IN LOVE,My 4 yr old is obsessed with dogs she fell in love with this movie the first time she seen it. I had to get it for her. She watches it at least once per day if not more.
4,My dog likes it,"This is a funny movie. It is not a hilarious movie, but it is amusing. The plot is a little thin, but it's one of those feel-good fluff movies that was never intended to become a classic.To my dog, on the other hand, this is the greatest movie on the planet. He loves to watch it! He gets excited whenever the movie dogs get excited and interacts with the show. It greatly enhances my amusement with the show."
1,"Thoroughly disappointing- Cuba, what were you thinking?","I have babysat many kids in my life, and consequently watched many Disney films. This is by far one of the worst I've seen. Sure, 9-year old boys and girls will love the slapstick humor, but parents will be wanting to pull their hair out if they have to listen to anymore of the predictable, unimaginative one-liners. I thought Cuba Gooding, Jr. was supposed to be this great, talented actor. So when the kids suggested we watch this film, I admit, I was looking forward to it. I expected some really touching scenes reminiscent of Remember the Titans or some truly hilarious moments like I saw in Cool Runnings. Instead, I was shocked to find overused jokes and no character development. Kids will love it, but parents, if you're looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy- forget about Snow Dogs. You'll be reaching for the aspirin long before it's over."
4,He talked to his team of huskies...,".as he mushed them through the snow...Prior reviewers have mentioned that the trailer led some to believe that this is a Talking Dog movie. (Actually, they only talk in a small sequence of a dream.) This Disney movie is better than a gimmicky talking animal flick. Filmed against the stunning beauty of Alaska, it deals, comfortably, predictably - with relationships - inside and outside the family and with the animal world - and is a funny travelogue to boot, including riotous rides on the sled.Cuba Gooding Jr., James Coburn, Nichelle Nichols, and Joanna Bacalso are well cast. I wish, though, that we could have seen more of Graham Greene, one of my favorite actors.It's cool fun for the whole family!"
5,A Good Comfort Movie,"Whenever I'm a little down, all I have to do is pop in this movie. I rented the movie expecting a cheesy movie about talking dogs. What I got was a more sophisticated Disney movie about a man, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., trying to find his place in the world when he discovers that he was adopted. When he recieves the will of his real mother, he travels to Alaska to sort everything out, and hopefully discover something that he has been missing out on. Something that maybe he was meant to do with his life. What he gets is a group of sled dogs. Gooding did such a wonderful job with this movie, and James Coburn, who plays The Mean Guy Who Doesn't Like Anybody, is really funny. Do not get this movie if you are expecting the dogs to talk. They only talk in a dream sequence. This movie isn't really about the dogs anyway. It doesn't detract from this movie at all, though. This is a wonderful movie, with some very funny scenes and one-liners. You won't be disappointed."
1,To Stephen Verhaeren,"""How can you say you like this movie when you give it 1 star?""It's REAL simple! We would like to see ALL of the movie! We don't want the sides cut off! We ACTUALLY understand how movies should be presented! Our IQs are higher than our shoe size! UNDERSTAND? Pull yourself into the new millennium and demand quality from these studios......."
2,As bad as Inspector Gadget,"I give this movie two stars wholly for the cast members. There are true artists that I admire in this movie in spite of the poor writing. Cuba Gooding Jr. does manage to pull some chuckles out of this movie despite the quality of the material.I was disappointed in the lack of material that was portrayed in both the teaser and the theatrical trailers that did not make it to the movie in the same way as they did to Inspector Gadet. The movie is not as funny as it was touted to be, nor do I find it a worthy film for children. There could have been more time devoted to the dog team since that was the focus of the movie. I was disappointed by the lack of morals portrayed in this movie. I expect better than that from Disney for a children's movie.This movie was advertised to be something that it is not. It's worth watching once, but don't invest any money in it. Babe one and two are much better movies in my opinion."
2,Where is the wide screen version?,"Little to add to the above comments, except that the Alaskan scenery would be more enjoyable on a widescreen TV if there were an anamorphic version of this release. This is something to watch out for when purchasing a Disney DVD."
2,no widescreen---no sale,"no widescreen---no sale. disney is selling this cut up, pan and scan, fullscreen movie for full price. i want the entire movie in widescreen as the director intended it to be viewed."
2,Disney should know better,"As an animal lover I found this movie to be a massive disappointment. The plot has a Miami dentist and dog hater (Cuba Gooding Jr) inheriting his late adoptive mothers sled dog team and moves to Alaska. This is just an excuse for lots of clumsy slapstick a la Cuba's LIGHTNING JACK. The dogs are amusing, but poor old Cuba is wasted. STAR TREK's Nichelle Nichols also co-stars, as does the late James Coburn, who also deserves a better script. Kids may enjoy this, but adults are advised to steer clear. For movies with cute talking animals, you'll never be able to beat BABE."
1,What? No widescreen?,"I give this 1 star because Disney decided to release it in Pan and Scan only. They THINK families prefer fullscreen. WRONG! As more families are educated about widescreen, the less people there are that like fullscreen. So, when Disney decides to release this in WIDESCREEN, I'll buy it, watch it, and give it a better review. Pan and Scan don't deserve more than one star."
1,FULL SCREEN GARBAGE,I DO NOT BUY FULL SCREEN EDITIONS....PURE GARBAGE WIDESCREEN OR NOT AT ALL+it BETTER have dts
4,This is a GOOD Movie!,"I saw this movie in the theatre and as soon as it was over I was looking forward to the DVD release. This movie is funny and heartwarming. The fast-paced plot is not as predictable as you think it will be. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is perfect for this roll because of all of the physical comedy. A great bonus is the performance of Nichelle Nichols as the mom. The scenery is breathtaking since this movie was filmed on location and not on a sound stage. This dogs are cute, of course, and add alot of humor to the story. One scene near the end is unnecessary--you'll know it when you see it--or I would give this movie 5 stars."
3,No Widescreen?,I figure they did this to sell 2 copies. In a year?? you'll be able to buy a deluxe edition that has both formats.Just had to respond to NJ. If it's not in widescreen why did you have to push full screen to remove black bars? You are among the majority who watch dvds on your huge pc screen? Did someone say DUH?
4,fun movie,I just like this movie for when I need a laugh. I've seen it before and it is just one that I wanted to have so I could watch it when ever the need came over me.
3,why so modest ?,"Lindsay Welsh in this book presents eleven different chapters from seven of her early books. All chapters stick with Welsh' favourite theme; lesbian sex with varying degree of D/S, as do the books too.After having red the original books (except ""Private Lessons"", which I've searched for for 2 years without luck!), I must say that the collection is more of an apetiser than a selection of the best, which is maybe not surprising, since that might affect the sale of the originals.But the collections fairly well represents Welsh style of writing, and represent a full span of D/S, from gentle ""Provincetown summer"" to the ""hardest lesson"".It gets 3 stars basically because i dont like story collections generally, and because I think som of her best writing was left out........."
1,"Reliability Problems, Noise Issues, Poor Quality Laptop","I have had the laptop for 3 years now. Fan makes a lot of noise all the time. Tone changes constantly and is very hard to ignore. There is a lot of information on this problem online. Secondly have had problems with dvd drive, costumer service is ok, but I bought a DELL and its much better. Try a DELL and forget the IBM/Lenovo."
5,Excellent book!,"That's War by Brannon Sirmon is a fascinating look into the Great War. Mr. Sirmon's great-grandfather, Captain William Arthur Sirmon kept a diary which details his service in World War I in 1918. We travel from Georgia in the United States to the front lines in France. Captain Sirmon shares the monotony of training each day waiting for orders and his experiences at the front, in the trenches. Captain Sirmon gives us a glimpse into daily life in 1918. We see how he passed his free time. We see his respectful yet candid annoyance with his superior officer. We see the friendships made even though neither party understands the language. We see his patriotism and pride in being an American. And we see the terror of the front line with life in the trenches, in the dark of night and in the hospital after injury.If you're interested in history or war, you'll want to read That's War."
3,Dance your Animal,"Was rather disappointed with this CD although the music beats are good. Its just not in the same caliber as Professor Trance's Shaman's Breath nor do I find the energies all together there. It is, however, unique and one I would recommend to people"
4,Extremely underrated.,"Pearl Harbor is probably one of the most underrated film of 2001.I watched this movie on a bad Tv and widescreen video and I still loved it.I didn't know what to expect when I saw it.The trailer looked very good but because of all the bad reviews I expected it to suck.It didn't.Sure,some of it is a bit baised and some of the romance is corny,but what do you expect?Another Titanic?The special effects were at their best and the acting was good.The silent,slow motion scenes were also effective,as they are in a war movie.I didn't care what people say about Pearl Harbor.It's my praise."
3,Nine Lives,"I had been waiting to see Pearl Harbor for a while, with all the hype and all. I finally have seen it and it definetely did not live up to the hype it created. The Pearl Harbor attack scene made the movie for me. For those of you who enjoy special effects of this magnitude, it's worth renting. Otherwise, its a sappy cliche' love triangle story. Im sorry, but Ben Affleck's character suvives not one, but two plane crashes?!? That was a little more than I could swallow. A good rental for me but that is all."
2,An overall bad movie,"This is just a down right bad movie. I mean, they put a few teen pop-stars in it to get the teen population to come see it, and then they made it into a war movie. this cast of characters needs to be in some mtv movie. The information in the movie is way off... they have just disgraced the one of the biggest tragedies in US history by trying to make it ARMAGEDDON!! This movie is just down right horrible... i would NOT advise you to spend your time watching it."
4,Pearl Harbor.,"This is a very good film with Amazing special effects,I have heard so much bad press about it,that it's not as it happened,but it's a very good film so who cares if it's not strictly 100 percent accurate,Im sure that no film like that is,They had to make it passable as a film and not just another war series or something like that.Top film"
5,Better than Titanic.,"Pearl Harbor was a great movie it was a romance,action,comedy,and basically horror film all in one.It was a great movie and Ben Affleck and his best friend in the movie look and act alot better than the sorry Leonardo Decaprio in Titanic.I think this movie should make it to the movie awards along with winning first place."
4,Pearl Harbor.,"I thought it was a good movie,yeah a bit silly at times,but it was a love story.It looked alot like the war movies form back in the day.The special effects were really good and the southern accents were the best I have heard in years.It is just a movie,not a Documentary.Get over it."
4,Disney releases a gland old movie.,Pearl Harbor is an event movie that treats its subject matter with dignity while never losing an opportunity to entertain royally and slickly.
4,Pearl harbor,Movie was kinda slow in beginning but got better the whole chick falling in love with the best friend was messed up. But it's a long movie must be willing to sit liked it all in all though
4,Pearl Harbor director's cut 4 disc Vista Series,i don't buy blu-ray version because it's not good about the feature and dont' have much bonus. i liked this movie personaly and i fans of michael bay too. but if u want to wait maybe blu-ray version can upgrade with a lot feature like dvd.
4,Special Effects,Didn't care much for the lovey dovey stuff but the special effects are immaculate. Love it on my 240hz tv!
5,An enjoyable war-romance movie,"I always love this movie on DVD and the Blue-Ray quality just make it perfect! The resolution and sound are a lot better, the war scenes feel so real."
5,Pearl Harbor,"The movie Pearl Harbor is about two childhood friends, who become pilots in the Army. Rafe McCawley(Ben Affleck) volunteer's to fly a plane in Europe leaving his best friend Danny Walker(Josh Hartnett),and his girl Evelyn Johnson(Kate Beckisale). The two are told Rafe is dead, because they draw closer together. Rafe turns up alive and hates Danny for liking his girl. Its through the tragedy of Pearl Harbor that they can get through their difference's.Jenny L."
5,Geez.,"Geez people.Even if you think you are too good for big movie blockbuster is have a little respect for the whole basis of the movie.It's just wrong the way you look at the big picture.Thousands of people died.It was the start of the biggest war in the history of the world.So have a little pride,but more importantly a litle heart."
3,Too proud to be good.,"The only thing this movie is worth to watch for is battle-scenes.But there only something about 40 minutes of them. And another part is Titanic-like story of love. But worse. In every part you may predict what will be next. Too much of pathos.3 stars with really big ""minus"". Only for battle scenes."
2,Why 2 Discs?!,"Great special effects but this is no ""Midway"". History buffs need not buy this disc. Save your money and rent this just for the special features.One of the reasons DVD's are so popular is that you can put an entire movie on one disc...Then why did the makers of this movie decide to make the consumer get up to change discs to see the conclusion of the film? Unacceptable. Wait until they put out a 1 disc version!"
4,I liked it!,"I really liked this movie. I understand the critism because it was labeled as a ""war"" movie and it clearly wasn't. So I see how one could be disappointed. I just saw it a week ago, much past all the hype. What I saw was a good movie, not a war movie. I will continue to watch it and enjoy it."
1,unwatchable,"Thank god I didn't bother going to see this at the cinema - got the DVD last weekend and even in the comfort of my own home with a nice glass of wine I couldn't be bothered to watch the whole film. Boring love story, bad casting (Kate Beckinsale was awful) - I want my money back !"
5,Pearl Harbor Blu-ray DVD,Excellent conversion! Great picture and great sound! All of the action scenes look life like and jump out at you. Great gift to go with a new Blu-ray player.
1,"Terrible, just terrible....","No wonder almost half the reviewers here gave this flick 3 stars or less...Shallow plot, way over romanced, and farfetched (how on earth could the fighter pilots have gone to bombers - carrier bombers at that - in that kind of timeframe is beyond me. This includes a stint fighting alongside the RAF in England).This movie rates with ""U-571"" on an accuracy level.It also does no justice to the two pilots Taylor and Welch (real guys who fought at Pearl Harbor) which is a real shame."
2,Average At Best,"Pearl Harbor is a movie unlike many others. Most films are fast and entertaining in the beginning and end, and slump in the middle. At the end of Pearl Harbor, I was bored. The best part of the movie occurs at about 90 minutes into this three hour monster. The attack on Pearl Harbor is absolutely thrilling and fast-paced. It will also bring out the patriotic soul in all of us. The attack lasts for 45 minutes and is the best part of the film. The problem with this movie is that the first 90 minutes and the last 45 minutes come no where near the excitement or involvement of the attack sequence. The love story is filled with cliches and it monopolizes most of the film. Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are fair, but Ben Affleck flounders. Rent this movie; do not buy it."
4,Better than Titanic!,"This movie gets a bad rap, but it's really pretty good! There's plenty of great action, including the bombing sequence which is very well-done. And there's a decent romance, though the acting by Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck leaves much to be desired..."
4,Pearl Harbor: After First Half Hour is Pure Gold,"I'll be the first to admit, the first half hour of this movie is really cheesy (with lines like Beckingsale writing to Affleck that she ""watches the sunrise and tries to take out each last bit of energy from it"" or some line that makes you want to throw up). After that however, it is a great, gripping film. Affleck, after the first half hour, is terrific and Beckingsale is adequate. Hartnett I believe is the real star of the film, in a true star making performance. The special effects are top notch as every one knows, and the ending gets you on the edge of your seat. Even as a guy, I welled up with tears when Cuba Gooding Jr. got his hands on the big machine gun and started firing away. Flawed movie? Yes. Great movie? You bet."
5,This movie was tight as hell.,"I loved this movie. It was well done and very accurate. The love story was hollywood, but would you rather have a 183 minutes of a boring history lesson. The special effects were excellent and the atttack scene is the main thing to watch the movie for."
5,Give Michael Bay a break!,"This film has suffered to much bad mouthing. It is a great historical movie. Titanic wasn't perfect either. This movie is just as good as Titanic. And, for those who disliked the nudity, F words in Titanic this will be welcome relief.The special effects are amazing. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnettgive strong performances. Kate Beckinsale is good looking.See this movie."
1,Accurate???,"First, let me say I haven't seen the movie. But based on the promos for it I was so turned off by the INaccuracy, I refused to see it.In the promos, there's a woman hanging up her wash on an outdoor clothes line. With the Japanese buzzing past her, presumably on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor.The facts are the Japanese attacked at 6:00am.Now, you may say that it's possible for a woman to be doing laundry at 6am on a Sunday.But in the same promo, there's also a little boy playing baseball by himself on a little league field. Also with the Japanese buzzing by.Complete and utter HOGWASH. And an insult to my intelligence.Admittedly, since I haven't actually seen the movie, I could be taking these scenes out of context. But if the Japanese planes had been sighted by civilians(not to mention the Military) at a time previous to the invasion, wouldn't that put a damper on a surprise attack?"
3,Okay.,"This movie was okay but could've been better.The love story was ok, but could've been better and the action was incredible.If you want to see a movie that focus on the attack on Pearl Harbor.Go see Tora Tora Tora."
1,Worst movie of all time.,"[...].I am a major movie buff and this was just one of the worst movies i've ever seen.It was so awful I couldn't.It wasn't realistic,bad story,and very predictable.The only reason this movie did well at the box office is because of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett.In fact I could tell just by the previews.I gave this movie thumbs down and a 1 out of 10."
4,"One of the few that enjoyed this movie, obviously","I am 28 years old and I am not sorry to say that I loved (yes loved) this movie. I don't really know how it compared to the historical event because our wonderful schools in this country did not teach my age group about it. Which is very sad. But I digress. I thought the acting was great and the special effects were top notch. (Typical of Michael Bay movies) But I am a female so that might have something to do with the fact that I liked this movie so much. But I generally DO NOT watch love stories or as some call them ""chick flix"". I do own the DVD and I would not trade any other movie for it. But this is just my opinion. Thank you for your time."
1,A Total Bomb!,"I saw this lame movie last night and was blown away by how weak it was. The lines were so trite that I actually felt embarrassed for everyone who was involved in this film. It was so ""Hollywood"". There was never a moment in the movie when I was not acutely aware of the fact that it was an over-inflated production. In other words, I never lost myself in the story. Also, I thought the attack scenes were awful. I mean, jeeze, whenever a plane was fired upon, the cockpit always exploded. The cockpit!? That would not happen. The fuel tanks are in the wings, not the cockpit. How stupid!!!!!!!!!"
2,Great Movie - Bad Deal,"The poor picture quality has been addressed elsewhere, but my major gripe is the lack of subtitles. People who are deaf or those of us who have hearing loss due to age can't really enjoy this movie. What a shame."
1,Dreadful!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. For those of you who know nothing about history and are fans of this wretched piece of garbage, I must give you this breaking news--the Japanese did not bomb Pearl Harbor to break up a love triangle!I would say that this movie has all the insight and intelligence of an ABC After School Special, but that would be an insult to children's television. If you want to watch a good movie about World War II, don't waste your money on this piece of crap. Buy Saving Private Ryan, Letters From Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers, The Thin Red Line, or Das Boot instead."
5,Dont listen to critics,"This is one must have DVD, everyone who owns a player should have a copy, its that good. The film is ouite honestly fantastic despite what all those magazine reviews say, i cant see why anybody would knock this,it appeals to all age groups, male or female. The romance element is in there for the ladies but is always followed with somthing for the guys to snigger at, its not the funniest of films but you can get a bit of a laugh from it. Then theres the action sequnce, 45 minutes of non stop pure action packed errr.... action, the guys will love it and the girls will cry as some of their most loved characters meet their maker, everyone will love it. The special features are great, toghther with the film they make a great gift for you or someone else. A must have in your collection"
1,This was so bad,"This movie is so bad I don't want to waste my time writing why. One can easily read everyone elses' comments to see why. I just had to add my two cents worth. If you want to see a good movie about Pearl Harbor, watch ""Tora, Tora, Tora"". If you want to see a better movie about Spitfires, watch ""Battle for Britian"". If you want to see a better movie about The Doolittle raid, watch the movie ""Jimmy Doolittles' Raid on Tokyo"". So on and so forth...What a terrible movie."
1,"Inaccurate, stultifyingly boring caricature of a WWII movie","Tora! Tora! Tora! is by far the better film for anyone interested in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.This film is an epic of inaccuracy and the boring love triangle is contrived and completely predictable.The viewer sighs in relief at the conclusion of the Pearl Harbour story only to realise with a growing sense of panic that there's another hour to go to cover the Doolittle raid as well.Why can't Hollywood simply find and show the genuine actual drama in stories like the attack on Pearl Harbour? This film is an insult to veterans, the US, Japan, in fact the whole world.Worrying is the fact that the average rating for the film is four stars, which betrays a general lack of knowledge and taste in the reviewers."
1,Cheesier than fondue,"Even if a movie is cheesy, there is good sort of cheesiness and there is the bad kind. This is definitely very, very bad cheese. If not for their very good marketing campaign and Kate Beckinsale, I wouldn't have watched this, but hey - who can resist Kate.Sadly this movie is an utter waste of time. Ben Affleck is easily one of the worst actors at the moment, the dialogue is gut-wrentchingly bad and the screenplay equally atrocious.I don't understand how Hollywood keeps forgetting that what ppl want is a good story."
1,Yawn.,"I can sum this movie up in one sentence, and I quote South Park--""I get it now--Job has all his children killed and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies...there is no God""."
1,"Long, drawn out, and INCREDIBLY boring","I don't mind a good love story being woven into a war epic, but this movie will test even a romantic's patience. It's got to be the most boring war movie I've ever seen. The director and writer were obviously trying to reproduce the success of ""Titanic"" in a different context but failed miserably. The actual Pearl Harbor invasion scenes are good, but you have to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for it. By then you'll wish the movie would just end and think back to the days when cruder special effects produced vastly superior war epics like ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""."
1,The Extras,"are the only reason for buying this ""Director's Cut"". The movie is still a stinker. ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" did a much better job. This would've been a much better movie if most of the love story were cut out. And the movie should've ended with the attack. Too much of a bad thing!"
3,uhhh ok,"Stunning graphics, loud booms, a hot lead star, and an over riding love story; sound like another movie...say Titanic? I thought so too. It starts out kinda weird, leaving you to wonder..um did i stumble into the wrong theater? Is this a chick flick with the whole love story thing, but then it's like all of a sudden it's like the writers remember, oh yeah there's a war going on, then it's like on man we forgot to end that whole love story thing, then it's like well let's drag it out abit, then BAM!! tadah! the end..leaving me to say uhhh ok..."
2,Just plain offensive,"When I heard that another movie about Pearl Harbor was being made, I was excited. I was curious to see what kind of result we'd get from Jerry Bruckheimer. After waiting in line opening night for three hours, I watched in horror as a horrific American event was turned into a sappy love story. Instead of the movie focusing on the actual event, and the heroes of December 7th, we had to endure watching two idiots fight over a woman, and then the attack scene. I will admit, the attack scene was very dramatic and the special effects were wonderful. That is the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Tora! Tora! Tora! is the only movie about Pearl Harbor that I will acknowledge as a decent piece of filmmaking regarding this crucial event in American history."
3,A Bit Long,"Honestly, one of the only reasons I saw this film was to see Ben Affleck. Like Titanic, this film is predictable in that you know the ending before the movie begins. Aside from the fact that my movie going experience was ruined by a man whose cell phone rang continually throughout the entire movie, I thought it was ""okay."" The thing that bothered me about this movie was that it ""Armageddon""-ized an event that shaped America's history for the past 60 years. The attack scenes were wonderful, but the plot and love scenes were predictable and unimaginative. If only for the special effects, I give this film a three out of five stars. ""Tora Tora Tora"" was definitely a more accurate portrayal of this event, and left a bigger mark in my mind"
2,Style over Substance,This is a classic case where the movie looks better than it really is. This movie released purposely on Memorial Day Weekend 2001 had a thin story line other than the Pearl Harbor Attack. Kate Beckinsale is hardly a good actress and the movie just suffers from bad acting from everyone. The other problem with this film is it is too long. They could have m ade this a 1 and a half hour movie instead of 3 long hours. This movie shouldn't be on two discs because DVDs can hold 4 hours and the extras and the song to this movie are terrible.
2,"One Great Movie on Two ""Inconvenient"" discs","If you loved the movie on the big screen, you'll love the movie on DVD. The BIG problem is that the movie is split-up on TWO discs!You have to get up, about three-quarters through the movie, and change discs!!With 6 hours of space available on one disc, I'm amazed at this ""Laser-Disc-esque"" format. They made a great movie a SUB-PAR DVD experience. I would rather watch something else than have to get up and change discs in the middle of a movie. I would buy it again in two seconds if the movie was available on one DVD, with the bonus materials on a second disc."
2,DVD Better Then The Original Theatrical Release,"This movie almost put me to sleep in the theatre. TOO, too mushc of a love story. Way too much! They could have cut an hour out of the movie and I would have enjoyed it so much more.It works better on the small screen. The attack itself is done very well. The story still lacks integrity, but the visuals are good.The best part about the DVD is the extra features. There is a great perspective video on PerlHarbor. Even the making of the movie documentary is much better than the movie itself overall.The best thing I can say is that the extras on the DVD are better than the Movie itself."
3,I liked this movie - Too bad it's another MPEG2 encode,"This movie was definitely one to show off the Blu-Ray format, but some corporate genius decided not to pay MS royalties for the use of VC-1, and they went with MPEG2 again on PH. Unless you have the sharpness dialed down on your set, or a 720p display blocking can be seen on this title pretty easily. If you're not sensitive to it then you're lucky. It comes through looking almost like a second layer of grain, but not the very fine grain of good film we're used to. I know some films are intentionally grainy, but rather than error diffusion (like real grain) this movie exhibits patterned grain. It is an artifact of MPEG2 block in motion.Titles released on Blu-Ray in VC1 encoding have proven how much better they can look. Why won't they maximize the potential of the format already?"
3,"Great movie, but so so video transfer","This movie is very enjoyable in plot and special effects. But, unfortunately the video transfer was poorly done in Blu-ray. If you already have standard DVD version, save your money."
1,What a waste,"The cinematography was beautiful and the sets were beautiful, catching the time period perfectly. What a pity that they had to be wasted on this pitiful excuse of a movie!Much like ""Titanic"" which preceded it (for which the above paragraph could apply in its entirety), ""Pearl Harbor"", rather than being a great movie about a historic tragic event, offended the viewer by using the event merely as a backdrop for a ""chick flick"" plot...and a very POOR one at that.I truly looked forward to this movie, believing the writers and producers would show this event the respect it deserved. So sad that the remaining WWII vets get THIS as a ""tribute"". What an insult! One can only envision the next step being a romance story called ""9-11: The Twin Towers""."
1,Soap Opera With Pearl Harbor Thrown In,My brother and I started watching this movie. We could barely get through it. We watched the first hour and turned it off. It was that bad. I was opened minded about it. Gave it an hour of a chance. The movie is like a soap opera. Bad all the way around. I guess some people might like it. I thought the writing was terrible. Makes you wince. The pace was slow and you don't care about the characters. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry.
1,Meet Titanic's little brother!,"Okay, I'll admit that the Special-FX and the acting was pretty good. However, the ghetto love story isn't neccesary! It's been done already in ""Titanic"", which is another Hollywood failure! Plus, the attack couldn't have looked anything like this!(""TORA! TORA! TORA!"" had a MORE realistic look). I was sooooo disapointed when I first saw this. They've made TOO many of these P.H. films already. Try something new for crying out loud!!! Want a better war movie? I suggest you skip this mess and see, ""Black Hawk Down"" instead."
1,Horrible,"The previews for this movie were very enticing, so I went to see it in the theaters with my friends last summer with high hopes. I was thoroughly disappointed. Kudos to those who wrote this movie for disgracing an important period in history by making this movie into a tawdry romance. I was expecting a movie about the WAR, not a twisted love story with a [bad] ending. Most of the people in my school who were raving about it cared nothing about the history; they only saw it because they had a thing for either Ben Affleck or Josh Hartnett. If you want to see a real movie, get ""Tora, Tora, Tora."""
1,A Total Bomb!,"I saw this lame movie last night and was blown away by how weak it was. The lines were so trite that I actually felt embarrassed for everyone who was involved in this film. It was so ""Hollywood"". There was never a moment in the movie when I was not acutely aware of the fact that it was an over-inflated production. In other words, I never lost myself in the story. Also, I thought the attack scenes were awful. I mean, jeeze, whenever a plane was fired upon, the cockpit always exploded. The cockpit!? That would not happen. The fuel tanks are in the wings, not the cockpit. How stupid!!!"
3,I liked it only for its action sequences,"Historically, this may be better than Titanic, but not by much. While I am pleased to see some of the stories of some of the things about World War II get introduced to a new couple of generations, I know that most of the things involving the lead characters is falsely portrayed and Hollywoodesque. I did give my students a recommendation to see the movie so that I could use what they saw as a gudieline, but I found myself often wishing that I hadn't due to the misperceptions and inaccuracies I saw historically.As entertainment, it may be, but I could not divorce myself from my feelings of annoyance knowing what I saw was not always the true story."
2,A Not So Good Movie in a Bad DVD Presentation,"First of all, this movie does not have a good storyline nor script. I have a feeling that the main characters were ripped off from some other story. And personally I think Josh Hartnett is the only one doing a decent job while the rests fall below standard.Secondly, the DVD presentation is extremely disappointing. The only reason I choose to buy DVDs is to get the whole movie uninterrupted. Of course I prefer DVDs with lots of extra features. However, I feel that just because there are not enough extra features to fill up the second disc, the studio actually divided the movie into 2 parts!This movie is only 3-hour-long, the same as ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Braveheart"", so I don't see any reason why the studio needs to split it into 2 discs. I must say that I'm extremely disappointed with this DVD."
1,No!,"Are there any clichés left which this film didn't make use of? In fact, in time it may be considered to be `clicking over' to be so bad it's entertaining. But I won't give it any stars for that."
2,Pearl Harbor - 2 hours too long,"I bought this DVD from Amazon 2 years ago and finally watched it yesterday.As a WW2 buff who grew up in England, I enjoy most movies about this era, however this one was mediocre at best.The RC airplanes getting their wings blown off in every dogfight, crashing into towers and still being decipherable, weird 10 minutes with the English battles, 10 minutes at the end for the Doolittle raid, ridiculous love triangle, was not what I had hoped for.The actual main battle scene was good, but there were way too many pretty people in this movie to make it real.And there was plenty of fiction in this one. Let's not use this content for any history books..."
1,Awful,"This movie is absolutely AWFUL. There was not a SINGLE redeeming quality about this film. Normally, if there's a few good explosions or a battle scene, then it usually can save a movie from the trashheap. It is THAT BAD when I can honestly say that the action did NOTHING to save this film.Torture. If you are sado masochistic then this is the movie for you."
1,What a joke,"I absolutely hated this movie. This movie is an absolute disgrace and a disservice to all the people who died on that tragic day. The biggest complaint I have about this sick mess is that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay have taken a serious and somber subject like Pearl Harbor and thrown in a silly love triangle involving hearthrobs Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale to appeal to the MTV crowd which of course is a huge market for the movie industry. That's what I dislike about Bruckheimar and Bay namely how they make big, lavish, loud, dumb-downed movies just so they can appeal to mainstream audiences. Bruckheimer and Bay are the Britney Spears of filmaking. Why am not I talking about the movie? Because there's nothing about the movie that's worth mentioning!! Don't waste your time. If you want to see a good chick flick then see A Walk To Remember or if you want a good war movie then watch Tora Tora Tora."
4,Pearl Harbor,This movie was in great shape. It was opened but there were 0 scratches and it worked very well! :)
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This ranks among the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Visually appealing, yes. But the story, the acting, the flow of the movie - just terrible. It was so bad, my wife and I actually contemplated not watching the 2nd disc - even though that's the half that has the attack, which I knew would be cool to watch; and yet - I had no desire to waste more time watching this film. The joke now is that if someone tells us they liked this movie, we know that we cannot rely on any opinion they might give on another movie.Yes, it's that bad."
1,A movie isn't just action scenes,"The Pearl Harbor attack is indeed spectacular (although a bit long) : good special effects, dynamic...But except for this 15-20 min scene, the movie is quite boring. The love story is just dumb and so predictable : young cute pilots, beautifull nurse, you add a 20 years friendship and a war, and you have the picture. After 5 min. you know how it is going to end (and I'm not talking about the attack)It is just another so-called ""entertaining"" movie (and it's not a compliment) except this one is lame. Famous actors and special effects don't make a movie even if it is supposed to be a patriotic one; you need a story, and this one is ridiculous."
2,One of the worst...,"The action scenes are quite good but that doesn't make a film. The scipt is terrible. Probably the most stereotypical plot possible for a war film, a woman loosing a man to war. I've seen that many times. Pearl Harbor has 2 hours of pathetic unoriginal footage. The only parts i cant complain much about are the action sequences because well, they came close to depicting war. However I thought Disney's desicion to not allow the film to be rated R was rediculous. It didn't make it seem as terrible as it was. Almost a lack of respect towards those who were at pearl harbor.If they weren't about to change the script so that the actual story [not the events of pearl harbor] were something new, the least stupid braukheimer could have done was shorten the thing to torture movie goers a little less. Thanks a lot...jerk....I can only hope he doesn't ruin BlackHawk Down, ridley scott beauty, the same way."
2,Waste of money,"The movie itself is alright, but Ben Affleck isn't an actor at all. He ruined the whole movie. Josh Hartnet was excelent."
3,A hard movie overall to give thumbs up,"It has a terribly cliched love triangle and scenes that are cut and chopped together in a pointless manner. Only when the attack on Pearl and the 30 seconds over Tokyo in the ending are we treated to an epic spectacle. Unfortunately, the remaining two hours is fairly standard and boring stuff. I like the stars but few are very good. Affleck is a good actor but I dont think anyone could have made such silly dialogue plausible. Its worth watching for the amazing battle scenes, which are to be honest hard to watch since they vividly represent a traumatic time in American history. I recommend renting it, unless you are a die hard fan of WWII films."
2,"Inferior to ""Tora Tora Tora""","I was hoping for a lot from this film, but I was disappointed.The effects were Ok, but using modern vessels as ""stand ins"" for some scenes did not look quite right.The entire last third of the film had nothing to do with the Japanese attack, instead it concentrated on the Doolittle raid.I feel that this was a pointless exercise, as it did not advance the plot, or tell anything about Pearl harbour. I think that the Doolittle raid deserves a film in its own right, it is a classic story of WW2.The film should also have concentrated on the real human drama of what happened on dec 4 1941, using actual historical characters, the USN, USMC, USAAF and US army produced many real heroes on that day.Making a film about their exploits would have been a far better tribute."
1,Even the longest day had better special effects,"Alright, I really like movies. But if you're used to quality products, this is not a movie you're after. ... First of all, it takes ages before the actual attack starts. And what about Benn Affleck saying he was in occupied France? After a few months he returns home. It's no secret Americans know nothing about Western history, but this really is not acceptable.Special effects. Alright, you expect a quality attack, a big overwiew of the Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, instead what you get is a camera who individually follows every aircraft one by one, then the bomb as it's flying through the air, an explosion where you can search for blood. Search thoroughly though 'cause it's like watching the A Team. Even the sound effects are nothing. And then the awful love story, but how come a film like Enemy at the Gates can pull it off to put a lovestory into a war movie? Simple, don't use Michael Bay for such a project."
1,Titanic was better.,This movie was very bad and it looks like its been made only for the money.The reason why James Cameron made Titanic is because he just wanted to make a good movie and not for the money.This movie had good effects but the script is bad.Don't see this movie and just go see Titanic instead.
2,Boring melodrama with occasional special effects,"As soon as the film opened with Soap Opera style melo-drama (which is never addressed in the remainder of the film) I knew this was going to be a tough one. The action sequences were brilliantly done, the story completely predictable and contrived. All of this could also be said about Titanic. However Titanic works because it embaces its sappy melo-dramatic nature. Pearl Harbor doesn't work."
3,Titanic all over again,"Pearl Harbor is another Titanic. What could have been a good movie was destroyed by an all to complicated love story. If you hate Titanic you'll think this movie is better. Luckily the love story drops down in the second disc. Speaking of the DVD it is an excellent crisp clear transfer, wth great audio!"
2,"Gospel truth, guv",The first half hour of this film is written as almost slapstick comedy. Now why couldn't 'Saving Private Ryan' treat the war in the innocent way it was meant? We also learn that the poor put upon Japanese were victimised by the USA with an oil blockade. Now why would they go and do a darn fool thing like that? No doubt the gospel according to Jerry would explain Nanking over their failure to lend the imperial army a cup of sugar. Alec Baldwin runs away with the cornball dialogue like there's no tomorrow and seeing as the atomic age was just dawning we can't fault him.
3,Not as good as it should have been,"If it had been made by Stephen Spielberg or Ridley Scott, this could have been one of the best war films of all time. Instead it was made by two people who think 30 minutes of fire on a few ships and 2 and half hours of love story makes a good war movie. It was still an OK movie. As for the DVD, what's with switching discs half way through? Sure, put the special features on a different disk, but at least keep the entire movie on one."
4,pretty good,"This movie was great, and by the end of the movie i really was crying. The movie is a kind of movie you only have to see once, though. Eveyone says either awesome! they are so cute, or i hated it! it is so boring! It doesn't have to be eitherYeah, there were somethings wrong for it, but there were many things that i didn't know about this attack, and learned.I think this movie is a must see movie (but that doesn't mean its necessarily the bast movie, just one you have to see)."
4,Pearl Harbor,"The basic theme of the story centers around the love triangle involving the characters played by Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett. The first hour of the film drags on at times in the building of this triangle. The film then ventures into the events leading to the bombing itself as well as the events after the bombing. The special effects were believable and well timed. The end of the DVD and VHS version offer a documentary through the History Channel with interesting explainations and facts surrounding the bombing. The cast of characters also include supporting roles by known actors such as Cuba Gooding Jr., John Voight, Alec Baldwin, Dan Akroyd, Andrew Bryniarski, and Guy Torry to name a few. With the movie containing a mix of history centered around a romantic theme, overall, it was an enjoyable film."
1,Pearl Harbor - the ultimate chick flick,"3 words can describe this movie: Titanic in khakis. The first 30 minutes or so of this movie will drive all testosterone from the room you're in. This is, without a doubt, a movie destined to be shown on Lifetime or Oxygen cable channels. Let there be no mistake who the target audience was: young teenage girls.The special effects in the attack scene were amazing, but the story was a blatant rip-off of Titanic and Top Gun (even down to the pilots buzzing the air control towers and having a character named ""Goose""). Overall, this movie didn't come close to all the hype around its release. I was thoroughly disappointed when the movie was over. Save yourself some time; the 30-minute attack scene is the only part worth watching. It takes more than just a pile of money (even $135 million) to make a good movie."
1,Now on ebay,"They tried to wrap Tora, Tora, Tora; From Here to Eternity and Thirty Seconds over Tokyo into one film..and failed miserably on all counts.Have you ever regretted buying a DVD ?? This is my situation... This is a sappy; historically inacurate, LONNNNNNG piece of filmmaking garbage...Did the writer ever read a history book or even watch the aforementioned movies ?? Imagine these two stars being involved in BOTH Pearl Harbor AND the Doolittle raid... wow !! Now that I think of it.. this is pretty much an insult to every vet who ever fought in WW2 on any front... All that was lacking was a laugh track..""1942 was more gripping and....more believable and that was fiction !!. Like the previous reviewer, I couldn't watch the whole thing either... Thank God, I have the new DVD of Guadalcanal Diary to fall back on.. I'm putting my Pearl Harbor DVD on ebay and hopefully I can recoup some of the cost..."
2,A poor cousin of Tora Tora Tora,This film tries to be a Titanic but fails miserably. Kate Beckinsale is unbelievable as a nurse with flowing long hair (?) For a war film it is too melodramatic to succeed.
3,I liked it only for its action sequences,"Historically, this may be better than Titanic, but not by much. While I am pleased to see some of the stories of some of the things about World War II get introduced to a new couple of generations, I know that most of the things involving the lead characters is falsely portrayed and Hollywoodesque. I did give my students a recommendation to see the movie so that I could use what they saw as a guideline, but I found myself often wishing that I hadn't due to the misperceptions and inaccuracies I saw historically.As entertainment, it may be, but I could not divorce myself from my feelings of annoyance knowing what I saw was not always the true story."
1,Tasted Great,"Wow, I don't think I have ever seen a better depiction of crap than in this film. The only thing redeeming is that Ben Affleck was in it...on second thought, there was nothing redeeming about it. And coporations wonder why people download movies instead of going and paying for them. In film (as it is in music) if your product is not worth paying for, people will download it. This film is one of many examples where the dobly 5.1 and HD quality picture makes no difference. Wanna see this film? Get it from Kazza"
3,"Too long, love story was stupid","Baisically the movie was too long and the love story was tacked on and unnecessary. My grandfather was at Pearl Harbor (bugler West Virginia), he talked about it all the time, he saw the movie and he agreed with me. He liked the battle scenes, but thought the love story was dumb too. I think we both wanted (and I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) an updated version of ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" I think Michael Bay would have been better off doing that, and having the Doolittle raid at the end rather than the lame love story. Make it more like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and less like ""the Notebook"" It was supposed to be a war movie not a chick flick! Oh well it is what it is."

1,Vile...truly vile...,"In all honesty, I walked out of the movie theatre after 20 minutes of the most cliché, predictable, ridiculous scripting I've ever heard.The previews built this up as a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor. What the viewer receives is a drawn out, Titanic-esque, melodramatic romance, with a 'smidgin' of battle to draw attention. While the battle scenes are impressive, they don't make up for the other two hours of clichéd writing.World War II can be a touchy subject for artists to work with. While I know that romance abounded during that time (how could it not, with soldiers leaving home and loved ones?), this movie SHOULD have focused more strongly on the battle...or else have the show renamed.If you want a *good* World War II movie, try ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", or best yet, HBO's ""Band of Brothers"".If you want bad romance and melodrama, try Titanic."
2,I Wasn't All That Bright to Begin With...,"... but I feel even dumber after watching this beautiful, but awful pudding of a movie. My ninth grade history teacher actually told us that this movie would be educational, but the only thing I learned after watching this movie is that the guy who starred in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER has gained a little weight, Ben Affleck is an awful actor, Josh Hartnett will still be an awful actor even after he changes that stupid haircut of his, James King is pretty and that the evil Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor for two reasons: 1, for ""oil,"" which isn't ever explained, and 2, to destroy the romance between the two pilots and the Olive Oyl girl they fight over.Oh and Cuba Gooding Jr. turns in another magnificent performance in his one recurring role in movies -- yelling like a goon into the camera."
1,One of the great bombs of all time.,"Everything in this movie is bad, the acting, the color, the special effects, the credits are even horrible. Not since Showgirls has there been this kind of awful film making. It is, of course, laughable in all areas...no one scene can be singled out for its non cinematic style and bad acting. Ben Aflik once more proves he cannot be considered an actor of any stature. He should go back to whatever he was doing before Good Will Hunting.All the others are terrible. Buy this and you buy travesty and trivia. An insult to the vets and even the Japanese."
1,Absolute (...),"Ben saves the world!Market Researchers go into overdrive (...)Add Benny boy for the chick flickers, and some bomb effects for the dudes who come along on the date.Mix in a heap of syrup and you have it!After the AOL CD's that litter this land, this DVD is the greatest waste of plastic and non-recyclables on this planet!I think that maybe the little seen (deservedly) flick called, ""Gone Fishin'"" was the latter day sequel to this one. Or is ""Pearl Harbour"" really the prequel to Danny Glover's vehicle of shame, ""Gone Fishin'""??Only time will tell if Benny boy ends up as a rug-wearing barrel like Burt Reynolds evolved into. One can only hope.... :)"
1,awful,"The worst movie of the year, and maybe one of the worse movies ever. Terribly written, trite, almost insulting to the movie goer. Whoever wrote this should be flogged. Only redeeming quality: battle scene."
4,Pear Harbor,"If you love romance movie than you'll love this, although I feel as if there was not enough story on ""Pearl Harbor"" itself. It was all about romance. But it seemed as if something was missing. Anyway, overall this movie was great, if i had to describe this movie in as few words as possible it would be a ""Pop-up excitement,"" you'll never know what they'll hit you with."
1,Bad beyond belief,"Movie should never have been released. This is not a history movie per se but another nauseating love triangle movie. Use of the Queen Mary and USS Missouri as scene backdrops totally inaccurate as one they are instantly recognizeable as their profiles are unmistakeable and neither type ship was anywhere near Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. All in all, a total waste of 3 hours."
1,On Pearl Harbor,"After watching Pearl Harbor, I found it impossible to determine which crime was more atrocious: the bombing of Pearl Harbor or the creation of the saccharin film. Are Hideki Tojo and Hirohito any worse than Michael Bay and Ben Affleck? History will judge."
1,Big disappointment,"I was interested to read other reviews of this movie as I found it the most disappointing movie I saw this year. The love story (stories?) did nothing to endear the main characters to you (if you could even believe that such events transpired) and the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was, sadly, only a small slice of the film. The action scenes were well constructed but it wasn't enough to save this movie.Also - I don't really think personal attacks on someone who writes a review is necessary. There is room for everyone's opinion on this page, & no one logs in to read your opinion on another reviewer, just on the movie, thanks."
1,"""Bora! Bora! Bora!""","Boring, stupid, banal, unneccessary and historically incorrect are all words that can describe this ""epic"" three-hour music video trash. (...)You want to know what really happened December 7, 1941 in the form of a movie? Watch the excellent ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" (1970) where the evil (..Japanese) are REAL people with REAL motivations and the direction of the film is excellent, as opposed to this albeit slick Michael Bay (Armaghedon, Bad Boys) rubish. I'll rate ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" right next to ""Patton"" anyday. As for ""Pearl Harbor""; let's just say I won't be ""enjoying"" this distasteful chick-flick at home anytime soon.""Pearl Harbor"" piddles on the men and women who LIVED the date which will live in infamy. I wish I could give it a rating of No Stars."
1,Disney's Penchant For Rewriting History,"Leave it to Disney to take the most important event of the 2oth century for the USA and make it an uninspired love story. I found some of the lines laughable and without a true understanding of the time and the people who lived it. Hollywood has repeatedly treated the viewing public with contempt. They believe that if you give the public alot of eye candy (Millions of dollars worth of CGI and good-looking acting hacks), the substance and quality of the script is irrelevant. That's like building a designer home with a foundation made of balsa wood. Such a moment in our history should have been treated with more respect and greater attention to detail. If Disney had done that, instead of trying to cash in on a Titanic-esque story, they would have made alot more money (which is all that they are really interested in)."
1,End of an Act... from Team America: World Police,"I miss you more than that movie missed the pointand that's a lot girl. And now, now you've gone awayand all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor suckedand I miss you.I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school.He was terrible in that film.I need you more than Cuba Gooding needed a bigger part.He's way better than Ben Affleck and now,all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor sucked and I miss you.Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies.I guess Pearl Harbor sucked just a little bit more thanI miss you."
2,"The action was good, but the romance ruined it!","When did they decide to make ""Titanic 2"". This movie had some cool VFX and action but the romance took up half the movie. ""Titanic"" was way better compared to this movie. I just hope that the special R-rated director's cut can make this movie more enjoyable, because this movie made me fall asleep several times. I actually fell asleep eating my popcorn. Mike Bay should stick to making intense action thrillers, not sappy love stories, especially ones that are true stories, that never had romance. Save yourself and wait for the R-rated version, because that one should be better because of the bonus footage."
2,This degrades the survivors of that fateful day.,"Thousands of lives lost. The USS Arizona with thousands of men trapped inside. An affair between two friends and their girlfriend. I thought it was supposed to be about Pearl Harbor and the men who died and survived, not about some soap opera where the best friend takes the girl then dies. This truly does degrade the survivors of that fateful day. I will admit, I gave it 2 stars because the Doolittle raid had its moments-until the end: ""Don't die! You can't die, because your gonna be the daddy of my girlfriend's baby!"" It seems more like a soap opera than a tribute, and although it has some parts to it, your better off seeing Tora! Tora! Tora! or even a WW2 documentary."
2,I tried to watch it with my daughter and best friend.,"I honestly did try to watch this movie at one point and just couldn't. It seemed like it dragged on forever and ever. I don't do the long synopsis of movies but I will say this. The story was supposed to revolve around these characters during the attack on Pearl Harbor. That much they got. But I didn't care about the characters, the development really stunk. I found myself rooting for the Japanese pilots, a la MST3K. Drivel doesn't even begin to cover it. The costuming was done well, and the props in the sets well selected, but that's about the only good thing I can say for this movie. Watch it once. This is a movie you'll either love or hate."
1,News flash! Special effects don't make the movie!,"Face it, technical effects and historical significance can't make a good movie without a script, actors and a director with vision.The only reason I can think of to watch this awful retelling of the story of Pearl Harbor is to make one realize how far writers/directors/producers can get from being able to bring a good story to the screen. The dialog is more wooden than the acting, the characters are stereotyped, the history is questionable, the emtional situations are contrived. Tora! Tora! Tora! is a far better telling of the history, and From Here to Eternity is a much better love story. I wonder how this would have come out if it was directed by Steven Spielberg and starred Tom Hanks. Oh, yeah. They made that move and called it Saving Private Ryan. Watch that great film if you are in the mood for a war movie. Watch Pearl Harbor if you want to weep for the victory of hype over substance."
5,Fantastic! [URL],"Hey, this movie just totally rocks! A combination of great music, special effects, loyal friendship, everlasting love and sad tragedy, Pearl Harbor is the best movie in 2001!When I first saw the movie, I immediately loved it! I saw it four times in the cinema and dreamed of owning it on a video - that dream became a reality. :o)That's all I have to say - this movie really is nice, do not listen to critics' reviews - they always find a nice movie to pick on! Go see it - even though I know 90 percent of you have seen it! I dont know what you think, but I think this movie is so beautiful yet so tragic! Buy it - period."
2,wrong message,"WHAT A JOKE! the only message in this film is : ""Japan-BAD, USA-GOOD! it's OKAY if more than a MILLION Japanese CIVILIANS die (and are still suffering + dying till today due to radiation exposure) but it's BAD BAD BAD if 2,000+ American NAVY boys die""you know what.. right after the scene where the Japanese dropped a missile at one of those ships, the credits should have started rolling.i'm giving it a 2 star for the battle scenes that had pretty impressive cinematography. the rest.. a complete waste of time. ben affleck should be thrown out of the film biz."
2,upsetting,i ordered the movie pearl harbor and i also paid to get it gift wrapped. when i gave the gift i looked at the discs and the second disc is scratched beyond repair.
1,Between U-571 and this...what hope is there?,"Between U-571 and this, the U.S. is trying damn hard to one up the likes of China, Japan, Russia and most of the Middle East in attempts at overt, revisionist history. Justifying Japan's brutal and aggressive campaign throughout Asia and the attack on Pearl Harbor? FDR standing (standing-up???!!!) in front of his advisors to make a point? Japanese fighters strafing people on taramcs and survivors floating in the water? Bombing the hospital? Dory Miller shooting down planes? The script also contains some of the worst 'romantic' dialog since ""Attack of the Clones."" Honestly, Ben-Lo should attempt another career path...seriously. I'm beginning to think the same about Beckinsale. She was terrific in ""Cold Comfort Farm"" but this and ""Underworld"" are near career-killers. I advoided this film for nearly 4 years but my curiosity got the best of me and boy am I sorry for letting it happen. Cripes, what a pinched loaf."
1,pearl harbor,With the exception of the digital effects that created the Ca. class battle ships this movie his pure hokum... watch Tora Tora Tora... and if your into naval accuracy get Windtalkers when it comes out on DVD. Too much needless gore but they got the right classifications of ships and the correct Destroyer Squadron that attacked Saipan... at least they did their homework.
1,YEAH RIGHT! I DID NOT FLOW WITH THIS DUMB MOVIE,"I LAUGHED, I CRIED, MY NOSE BLED, AND I HAD A HEADACHE. COME ON THIS MOVIE SUCKED! CAN YOU SPELL BORING! SNORE, SNORE, SNORE! ZZZZZZZ! THIS SPECIAL AFFECTS ARE GOOD, BUT I'D RATHER FLUSH A FISH DOWN THE TOILET! BEN AFFLECK( OK), KATE BECKINSALE ( ALL RIGHT), CUBA GOODING JR. ( OK), AND JOSH HARTNETT ( GET A LIFE!)THIS MOVIE SUCKED! I HATE THIS WASTE OF FILM! LOSER!"
3,movie was ok but great dvd planned,"this has some of the best war scenes ever. the only problem is that it is not 100% accurete and it takes over 90 min to get the war started. this is like titanic, where it takes at least an hour or two before the boat hits that iceberg. if u get the chance, get the directors cut r rated edition which comes out the 3rd or 4th of jan. its 3 discs and will be about the same price as this editon. it contains about 10 min extra and has an intermision to. this is a love story so if u can get over that its a good movie."
2,Poor Quality,The video skipped from almost the very beginning. I use this every year in my class and now must get another one.
3,I expected more,"As a WW2 Veteran, I wanted to see what the recent Hollywood attempts to tell about the early phase of the War. It turned out to be basically a love triangle, and not a very good one. I preferred ""In Harm's Way""."
2,A block-BUST-er,"This Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay bomb (so to speak) has great special effects but a very weak, predictable plot. Bruckheimer and Bay didn't get it right with ""Armageddon"" either and apparently don't understand that special effects alone don't make a movie good. They really love Ben Affleck don't they? He can't act period. I gave it 2 stars only for the special effects, otherwise it's a 1 star bust. See the movie Tora!Tora!Tora! if you want a true, historical account of the attack on Pearl Harbor."
2,Watchable trash,The director and producers seem to have followed a recipe called 'How to make a blockbuster'.- Take two attractive young men that guys want to be and girls want to date.- Add a love interest.- Pack in lots of action sequences that have worked in other hit movies.Pearl Harbor is another one of those hollywood films where they feel that portraying the historical events accurately isn't exciting enough and so they need to be fictionalized in some way. If you're looking for a history of the Attack on Pearl Harbor then see Tora! Tora! Tora! and if you are looking for a decent action film then there are plenty of others to choose from.
1,"Loud, brilliant effects- mediocre writing","The womens auxuliary re-enactment of the attack of Pearl Harbor (as done by Monty Python) is as accurate and was more entertaining. If Hollywood was smart they would realize that the history of the events and the people who lived it, were alot more interesting than their contrived characters who have little more style than substance."
2,"Too long, too flat, too disappointing","I really wanted to like this movie, with its stellar cast and deep (I thought) subject matter. Instead I got a soap opera that's about two hours too long.The talented actors, especially Ben Affleck, are wasted on a trite love story, and the war itself takes a back seat to melodrama. The battle takes up about ten minutes of the movie, with the rest of it ""which guy will this girl end up with?"" I was thinking ""Who cares"" by the time the film finally ended.I give ""Pearl Harbor"" two stars for its stunning sets, costume design, and re-creation of the period.Amazon guidelines limit my final statement. I find this film's attempt to cash in on an American tragedy to be of questionable taste. (60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition???) Please remember that this was a national tragedy in which real men lost their lives."
3,not much action,this movie had practically no action. it was just the love story. that's all i have to say sorry.
2,bay and bruckheimer,"you know, the best thing about this movie was the trailer that i saw before the movie actually came out. that was one of the best trailers for a film i have ever seen. it drew out the emotion of that attack like nothing else could. why is it though that jerry bruckheimer and michael bay can't stop being so sappy with their films and just letting the event sap the emotion out of us. they do this with Armageddon and The Rock, and now with Pearl Harbor. be wary of the next Bay/Bruckheimer production....bring lots of emotion to be ""sapped."""
3,If you liked Titanic,If you liked Titanic you'll probably enjoy this film... there's lots of action and some cheesey romance... It's entertaining but was definitely too long for the kind of movie it was... I was glad I saw it but I dont think I'd buy it.
5,a dynamite of a movie,pearl harbor is a masterpiece for its great actors and actresses and how the director so realtisticcly showed us what we thought was the end but was the beggning for us. I rate this movie 5 stars for its great story line it shows adventure drama and what we cant live without romance.
5,One of my favorites.,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. I cried at the very end, because it was so sad. The acting, and special effects are excellent. Please don't let the bad reviews put you off, this movie is extremely moving, and well done."
4,A Great Action/Love Story.,"...If you like action films,you will like this film.The acting is very well done and the cinematography was indeed first class.Will it win any awards?probably not,but it is certainly worth seeing on the big screen.The trailers for the movie pretty much show you what you want the movie to be like,so if you liked the trailers,you will like this film."
5,Tight.,"This movie was very cool,and tight.The attack sequences were awesome,and the script was well written.I recommend this classic to anyone who's looking for a good time."
2,A Note You Should Know,"Historic title aside, it's a Hollywood love story. Consider yourselves warned"
3,It was okay.,"Well I'm a teenage girl and I gotta say, Josh Hartnett is the HOTTEST guy in the world. But I hated the love triangle thing. It was so stupid and you knew that Danny (Hartnett) was going to die because Rafe(Affleck) already ""died"" once so they wouldn't kill him off again. The action scenes were really good and I thought the movie was sad. All in all, this movie did an okay job at recreating the real Pearl Harbor."
2,Has The Feel Of A Bad TV Miniseries,"A pleasant enough love story shot on the location of the actual battle, the movie unfortunately suffers from gross historical inaccuracy, video game-like special effects, and dialogue which is not believable. I was greatly disappointed, given all of the prerelease hype, and all of the on-location shooting, which was essentially wasted."
1,Hollywood garbage at its best,"This is what you get when you combine a badly written soap opera and a one-sided, shallow propaganda film.The movie was obviously an attempt to replicate The Titanic's formula: take a historic event and lace it with a love story. However, in this case, they failed miserably. The characters are shallow, the dialogues and the script ridiculous, the acting - well even all of Hollywood's stars couldn't save this doomed project.Put all that aside, the Pearl Harbor attack sequence, which is about 30 minute longs in the middle of the movie, is worth watching, especially if you have a good home theater system. If not, well you didn't miss much...."
2,Pearl Harbor-this flick should be on the bottom,"Quite simply, it's Private Ryan takes the Titanic to Armegeddon. Special effects cheesy, all the airplanes were out of trim. Melodramatic to the max. Even my wife thought it a bore."
1,BORING AND DUMB,"Those are the 2 words that summarize that movie (and any Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer flick). To be honest, I only watched the first 2 hours, I was so bored I stopped the dvd. This is the usual junk that shows just how bad Hollywood blockbusters have become. All the money is put on visuals and special effects and the producers forget that you need *good actors* and *a good script* to make a movie. Historically, this movie is a farce. Avoid at all cost!! Rent (or buy) Tora! Tora! Tora! if you want to know what really happened on that day."
1,What a waste of time and money!,"This is one of the worst so-called blockbusters I have ever seen. It fails to hold together as a whole, and its component parts fail to convince. The Affleck/Beckinsale/Hartnett love triangle left me with no sympathy for any of the characters whatsoever. In fact the only people I felt any sympathy for were the Japanese for wanting to drop lots of high explosive on them.The action sequence, whilst impressive in terms of pure effects, was too confusing to leave any sense of emotion - I felt neither angry, nor sad, nor anything really, except wondering what the hell was going on. And the post-attack part of the film is instantly forgettable.""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" was so much better in every way. For one thing, it brought out some real emotion as it got to grips with the key issue of the attack coming prior to the declaration of war - a fact ignored in ""Pearl Harbor"".I was genuinely bored watching this movie and I wish I hadn't bought it without seeing it first."
4,A War Film With a Very Good Story.,"First of all, this film is VERY sad. It is almost deppressing. Good news. This film has some humor, and a triumphant ending.I will not disclose this film's story in my review. You need to see it for yourself."
1,Oh please!,"I am not even going to go into detail on the number of historical inaccuracies of the film. The briefing; the plot behind the name; is nothing more than the typical - i.e. two drop-dead manly flyboys fall for a makeup encrusted portrait of a nurse, thus forming a love triangle...and so it goes. The film dishonors the men who fought and died at Pearl. There appears to be no overall theme, the characters are cardboard, the plot is shallow, Pearl Harbor has practically been thrown in just so that the directors had something to blow up, and historical accuracy totally flunks out. Had the film really focused on Pearl Harbor, something might have been achieved. But because it had to be written and aimed at the typical teenage audience, it fails miserably."
5,A film of EPIC proportions! Nice job!,"This film is in the same league as 'The Titanic', production-wise, treatment-wise, and quality-wise. Sonics are stunning, given the THX soundtrack, and what appears to be meticulous digital mastering, and the video quality is equally phenomenal. I would even venture to say it is state of the art DVD reference quality, especially viewed on a larger hi-res HDTV ready screen. This was a perfect melding of love story meets the fury of war! OK, 3 hours is WAY too long for a movie (Hollywood should stick to 2 hour flicks), but I managed to enjoy this movie for what it tried to portray, mainly a human element amidst all the carnage and death raining down from above. The special effects are stunning, and all in all, I would rate this a solid 5 stars, given this film's tour-de-force production, and the accuracy of it. Rent this one if you want to give your DVD player/TV a workout!"
2,Good techincal; bad content,"Techincal achievements:=======================- Visual effects are excellent. Color contrast and clarity are well above average. Some perspectives, like that of dog-fights among the fighter planes and exploded fighters in mid-air, were nicely done in terms of its intended effect. Some visual effects are also borrowed from Titanic.- Audio effects are also well above average, although certain techiques, like that of incoming bullets arriving, is not novel and has been done in Private Ryan before.Story & content===============- Catering more for teenage romanticism, care-free and impulsive.- Acting abilities: 2.4/5.0- Dialogs: 2.0/5.0- Plot: nothing impressive"
4,"December,7,1941",A movie that will live in our memory forever. I think that this movie gives us just a little more than just the attack on pearl. It gives us a glimpse of what it was like in those days.The attack on pearl is the best attack seqence of all time period.The picture is great and the audio is great if you can sit thru some slow scenes than you will be rewarded with one of the most moving action the camera has ever filmed. just go out and buy this disc please.
3,there are better pearls than this one,"There are 3 elements of interest in this movie : 1) the bombing of Pearl Harbor, 2) the romance and 3) the historic US retaliation of April 1942 : the first bombing raid over Japan.As far as history is concerned, ""Tora, Tora, Tora !"" (by R. Fleischer) is much more interesting to cover element 1).As to element 3), it's definitely much better to see ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" (by M. LeRoy) in which there's is quite a bit of romance too and an interesting description of the love relation between the airmen and their planes.""Pearl Harbor"" may be more spectacular - and perhaps mostly more expensive - as the 2 movies mentioned here but it certainly doesn't deserve to be remembered as much."
1,Stick to Transforming Robots Mr. Bay....,"What a awful disgrace of history on film. To take one of the most tragic days in American history and distill it down to a tepid romance is shameful. Just because a film is 3hrs. plus doesn't make it a epic and the miscalculation to spend the first third of the movie away from Hawaii is just bad storytelling. Why not begin with the men on the ships and get to know some real characters that we actually care about instead of some cheesy 3way love triangle, that way when the terrible attack occurs we feel real sympathy for the men instead of blasting us with mind numbing sound and effects. This could have been a great film about a important day if Spielberg or Cameron had done it. The finished film here will be remembered only as a national embarrassment."
4,"Amazing sound, good pictue quality",This is a great movie to show off your sound system. The uncompressed 5.1 pcm is outstanding.
2,A Big Disappointment,"When ""Pearl Harbor"" came out three years after ""Saving Private Ryan"", I was hoping for a similar dramatic blockbuster that infused admirable and likable characters into an action-filled, heart-tugging, and well-directed/produced movie. Instead (and how can I articulately put this?) well, quite frankly, it sucked.The acting was extremely poor in the lead roles (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale). Even with the number of high-quality actors in it (i.e., Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Josh Hartnett, etc.) they were not enough to save this film.The special effects, however, were quite remarkable and one of the few bright spots in this cinematic bummer. Unfortunately, these first-rate effects didn't make up for the awful acting."
3,Drama,"Understood that many of the soldiers in WWII (or any battle for that matter) experienced alot of loss on the home front with women but this movie is a painful love story for the first 90 minutes. If you don't mind watching Ben Affleck cry then you'll love it. The battle scenes in Europe are highly dramatized (although the actual Pearl Harbor attack was quite detailed IMHO). Plenty of DVD extra's if thats your thing, but as far as a good war movie goes, Pearl falls very short.Three stars because I like the effort and the effects are stunning, but if you want an accurate recreation of Dec. 7, 1941 buy Tora Tora Tora."
2,Could have been good.......but,"I really wanted to see this film in all its glory, very famous & unfortunate time in history when Pearl Harbour was attacked by the Japanese navy which subsiquently bought the U.S fully into WW.II. This Film had so much potential but in my humble opinion failed to deliver, effects were outstanding location and visuals really good, the rest i found really hard to bare, tacky lines in the film which made me cringe and some scenes made this film more like a goverment recruitment film, the love story was tacky, not very believable thus predictable. I think Kelly's Heroes or Tora,Tora,Tora, Battle of the bulge would be better viewing and they were made a while back and stand up better."
2,"Great expectations,but where was the script","What a ridiculous string of cliches and bad dialogue this screenplay was made up of.The invasion sequence was amazing,but to make audiences sit through two hours of literally the worst love story in movie history is in itself a crime against humanity.If you must go see this movie,buy your DVD and just go to the attack scene."
2,Try and spot the acting between special effects it's hard.,"Special effects as with all movies like this are state-of-the-art impressive.Unfortunately,good though the main attack sequences are,they don't compensate for the sheer.Woodenness of three leads.I used the skip button alot.The use of obviously modern ships for many scenes is also irritating-surely ILM could have managed a few more effects basically this is a real stinker and should win a golden turkey."
5,A Better Mix of Romance and Tragedy than Titanic,"Although snickering movie critics say that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay's Spring 2001 release of ""Pearl Harbor"" was a bomb, I tend to disagree. Critics state that the four category Oscar nominated film focused on the romance part and not so much the events leading up to, during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. But, didn't ""Titanic"" focus on romance for two hours, then the ship sank and the movie ended? It still won, what, 11 Academy Awards? I enjoyed the film, because it was dynamic and even though the actors didn't really have a great part for one another, they really acomplished their character. The cast was huge and well chosen and the music was tops for that certain type of movie. The visual and sound effects were tremendous and every crew member did their part. I think that the film should deserve more recognition and more praise for its on-screen heroics."
5,Sweet.,"I think this movie was wonderful.It gave me a better understanding of the horrific attack on Pearl Harbor.Even though the movie was three hours long,it didn't seem too long.At the end of the movie I was left in a awe.It was truly amazing."
2,Just skip to the attack.,"It's hard not to believe on a day when more than two thousand Americans died,that there wasn't another compelling or convincing story which to carry a film.Buy the DVD and gom to the attack scene."
3,Well.,"A fine cast acts the heck out of the tragi-romantic roles,and director Michael Bay handles the attack,which halfway through the three-hour film,with suspenseful aplomb.Still,he's the wrong man for this job."
5,"A Really,really,really brillant movie.","This is excellent-the cast,the story line,and the amazing special effects are all spot on.Its definately up there with Titanic and Armageddon.Good for a girle night in as u will all fall in love with Ben and Josh,and will definately be crying your eyes out by the end."
3,Great movie.,"This movie was really a great picture.The cast does wonderful jobs at playing their roles.The love story was okay,but the action scenes were incredible.I love when they went back to bomb the Japanese.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good time."
2,Disappointed,"Although this would have made a great science fiction film, it was billed as being based on a true event -- Pearl Harbor. Maybe their overdoing of everything was to appeal to a younger generation of movie-goers, but this epic is executed like an over-budgeted music video. Why oh why didn't Jerry Bruckheimer make this movie like Black Hawk Down (which had some of the same actors and a similar 'military tragedy' plotline). However, two stars are deserved SOLELY for the hospital scene, which I thought was excellent, yet it was only a small fraction of the film."
1,Awful,"This is one of the worst movies of 2001. A total waste of time and talent. Other than the bombing scenes there is no reason to view this terrible, boring, superficial film."
3,Pearl Harbor & Tora Tora Tora together in one... SUPERMOVIE!,"Pearl Harbor has a horrendous love story, then an exciting bombing scene, and then a totally unnecessary Doolittle retaliation. Solution: Buy both the PH and the TTT DVDs, take TTT, split it into scenes, do the same with PH, throw away all the bad and useless scenes from PH (that is, the love story and the Doolittle raid), splice them together. Result? A 3.5 hours SUPERMOVIE. TTT adds the true historical side to the event, PH adds the realistic side. That's a movie that I would not miss for nothing in the world, and since Hollywood is NEVER going to make such a movie, I decided to do exactly that, do all the splicing myself (sorry, guys, it's for private viewing at home only, otherwise the legal dogs will be barking at my door)."
1,160 minutes???,"Well, I tried watching this, I really did. The attack footage is spectacular, the rest of the movie is such a waste. When you have a list of people like this movie does that you just know can act (Affleck, Baldwin, Sizemore, and Gooding) and this is what you get out of it, I think it says something. This movie says Michael Bey should stick to the movies where things blow up and he tells a buddy story and leave the romantic pieces to others.I may be selling this short as I did use the skip ahead a number of times to try to get past the plastic romance, but the fact that I used it at all is telling. If you want to see a good movie about Pearl Harbor, get the reissue of Tora! Tora! Tora! The effects are dated (it's 30 years old after all) but a much better movie."
1,Worst Movie of 2001,"Of all of the movies that came out in 2001, this has got to be the worst movie of them(and their are plenty of horrible big budget movies that were released this year). The movies makes a couple of farm boys look like Demi-Gods against Japanese pilots who have been in combat for almost a decade. Not only that, Afflect never did tell his Beckinsdale how he survived after being shot down in France all those months. He says he'll tell her later but he never does. One of the many loose ends that is conveniently forgotten. There doesn't seem to be a overall moral like all war movies before except Americans are great and big explosions.Love story may have worked if they didn't throw the third wheel in but alas what could have been. Tora, Tora, Tora is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than this movie and that was made in 1970. If only Tora, Tora, Tora was made with the kind of budget and special effects nowadays. Don't walk, run away as far as possible from this movie."
1,A really really bad movie. One of the worst I've ever seen.,"This movie is not about Pearl Harbor. The attack on Pearl Harbor is in the movie but only after 2 hours of a love story that doesn't get shown in the ads.This movie was made for little girls who want a Titanic romance type story. Titanic was not a bad movie, but the things that made Titanic a decent movie are not in this movie.This movie is way to long, not really focused on Pearl Harbor, and not worth the time or money."
1,"Hey Michael, learn some history!","Sure the effects are cool, sure the actions are great... and sure some people watch for the romance, but I really hate it when directors do a real poor job on details and accuracy of past events. First off the date was wrong in respect to the Japanese calender, the chronological order of some events were wrong, popularity of certain warhead and machinery were wrong... I can continue for hours about how terrible this movie can get. You wanna see romance? Go see ""Thomas Crown Affiar."" You wanna see a war flick? Go see ""Saving Private Ryan."" Just don't watch this movie, it's simply not good enough (any way you look at it)."
1,"A Love Story, The ""War"" Is just a backdrop.","Being somewhat of a Ben Affleck fan, mostly just of his Kevin Smith movies, I went to see this movie, thinking it will be a fantastic war drama. And lets just say this, in my 30 years on this planet, this was the only movie I ever walked out on. It is boring, sappy, insipid, mushy, and lost all aspects of the little war that happened to be going on. If you want a real war movie, rent Saving Private Ryan."
1,Missing disc,"I ordered this product a long time ago, but never opened the case. I finally opened it up and one of the discs was missing! I can't even return/exchange because it's been YEARS and I can't enjoy the movie.WEAKEST PURCHASE EVER!"
5,Fantastic DVD for an average movie,"The director's cut is much better than the PG-13 version that was previously released. The movie still suffers from the love triangle B.S. that clouds the real purpose, but it's worth wading through to get to the battle sequence. That's the payoff. Body parts flying, blood, guts, extra explosions. It's just as graphic as Black Hawk Down. As for the extra features -- stellar! Great, in-depth stuff and worth the price. The packaging is really good as well. You get some postcards and a small flyer. It's a good package. There's a ... rebate inside the DVD for those of you who've purchased the previous version, so you really get this new package for [money], which is a bargain considering what you get. If you liked the movie despite the romantic stuff, you'll love this version."
1,Root Canal Surgery,"...This was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. The actors were bad. The plot was bad. The script was bad. All this stretched out into three hours of suffering. Well, OK, two hours - the pearl harbor attack sequence is pretty cool, but you have to wait through an hour and a half of bad dialogue to get to it. Don't waste your time here. Move along."
2,Disappointing,"The attack and battle scenes in this movie were very good. But other than that it had little to offer. The sub-plot of the love story was weak and predictable. I was dissappointed in the movie as a whole. I felt that there was a lot of promise to this movie that for some reason was not fulfilled.It seems as though some people really liked this movie but that was not my opinion. My advice, I would view it first and decide before buying. A mistake I made was to buy before viewing based on information I had heard from friends. I was sorry I did not rent it first."
2,Hollywood At It's Worst,"Everything about this movie seemed to have a made up fakeness about it. The historical inaccuracies were glaring from the beginning. The acting at best was medeocre and the romance was completely ineffective. Even the much applauded 30 minute battle seemed to be a little to prestine and precise. It looked great, but did not have the grit or edginess to make it feel real. Michael Bay's MTV style of direction doesn't help this type of movie. All in all if you want the real Pearl Harbour story, rent ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" a vastly superior film in all ways."
2,Ppppplllllleeeeaaassee,"When I saw it at the theater with a group of other middle aged friends, I enjoyed it; but watching it again alone in my living room, I felt like, why bother?? Being with my friends the first time gave me the opportunity to voyeour their watching it.While some of the characters and events in the film are true, the love story aspect was just too sappy. Give me a break. Danny dies and Raf gets the girl, the baby and the happily ever after.The love story really distracted from the story line. Special effects were good, though, as well as the music. I bought the soundtrack hoping to relive some of the 40s magic, but it was mostly orchestral with just that one song by Faith Hill. I had to find another CD with classic 40s music to enjoy."
5,Gotta See!,"I thought this movie was awesome! The special affects were great and the bonus material on the dvd was great to! i really enjoyed watching the making of it. It was really interesting. This movie is a must see! Its a movie with a mix of romance and drama. Even though there is more love story then history, it is definately still a must see! I loved this movie because it told an important story and i also think Ben Affleck (Rafe McCawley) and Josh Hartnett (Danny Walker) are totally hot!!!!"
3,"How Deprssing! Adria Schmidt age 10 and a half ""It was ok..""","Well, I'd have to admit... It was very intense, dipressing, and made me notice who bad it would be if I had been their. I just can't beleive SOME people survived. I loved waching ""The Making"".I can't beleive that some of the bons blowing up were real. And sometimes the planes were real to. If you like WAR movies, you'll like this one."
4,ph,"the love story isn't great, but it's not THAT bad. And the battle scenes are the best arial attacks you'll ever see!"
1,BAY + AFFLECK = REAL BAD,I truly wish that michael bay would have stopped making movies after this horrible excuse for a film.
1,Horrible movie,"While I have little regard for Roger Ebert's opinion on movies or anything else, he did pretty much nail this movie by dismissing it as the story of how the Japanese Navy interrupted a love triangle. This movie is an incredible trivialization of such an important historical event.It is also a fictional version. Doris Miller's actions were heroic, but he did not shoot down any Japanese planes. The pilots on whom the characters played by Ben ""Aflac"" and the other actor whose name escapes me were based did not down three Japanese planes by playing chicken with them. The attacking Japanese planes did not zip in and out and around ships and buildings like Star Wars TIE fighters.But why am I even bothering to go into this much detail? The movie is horrible. Leave it at that."
1,Not a history film...,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, as judging from the trailer, it was a fantastic looking movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie turns out to be less about the attack and the war, and more about a love triangle between the three lead characters. The scenes of the Japanese attack are truly fantastic, but apart from those visuals this movie is horrible."
1,Can you give a film fewer than 1 star?,"It's a pity really, that any film with the vast resources and talent that Pearl Harbor had should fail so spectacularly. With the possible exception of the writer(s?) and director, the forces arrayed in making this film could have put together a true cinema classic. Instead they turned it into a cocktail joke.This is doubly sad, of course, because the historical events depcited here have so many natural and compelling stories (even fictions) that could and should be told. I'm tempted to call this film an insult to those who served and/or died that day. But that's not really fair. The intentions here were good, the execution was lazy and sloppy."
2,"Snora, Snora, Snora (or Bora, Bora Bora)","It is too bad this film did not live up to its billing. Too many inaccuracies mar what could have been a great film, given the budget and special effects (which are pretty good). The characters don't develop through the movie and it leaves out why December 7, 1941 was important. And the DVD is a bit expensive given all that."
1,"Bad, corny, awful. (Good explosions, tho)","This is an icky, overblown, overacted travesty. Some corny movies are good; this isn't one of them. I thought it was dreadful. The horrific special effects, however, were quite good, and did convey some visceral sense of how awful the attack on Pearl Harbor really must have been. Still, what a cheap way to evoke painful memory."
1,Movie is perfect. But I found FunLove Virus in Disc-2 :-(,"Today i just bought this DVD from the future shop in Canada. Because i don't have the DVD-Player, so I just tried it with my DVD-ROM. The strange thing happened: my Norton Antivirus poped up a window and it said there's a W32.FunLove.4099 virus in Disc 2. But I don't believe it, so I still tried to run it. Tonight, I want to make sure if there is any virus in my computer; so I used Norton to check all the hard drive. Do you know the result? There are 526 files are infected by FunLove. It's terrible! I don't believe my eyes! I strongly ask the DVD company to destroy all these DVD."
4,Great movie just a little too long,"This was a great film with gorgeous scenery, explosive sound and exceptional acting led by Ben Affleck, . In short, the movie was at first a love story followed by the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and lastly a top secret mission to bomb Japan. The plot flowed well and the character development was quite good. Some may find the love story to be over-the-top for a movie such as this but it threaded through the entire movie seamlessly.(TV: 32"" Sony Trinitron (KV-32S40))(DVD player: Panasonic RP-56)(Cables: Acoustic Reasearch top-of-the-line)Picture quality: Excellent. Crisp and clear as paper.Sound quality: EXCELLENT. I cannot say *enough* about the DTS soundtrack with this film. I was blown away at the quality and authenticity of the sound.It gets 4 stars instead of 5, however, because it's a bit too long (3 hours)."
4,Titanic 2,"Okay, its not really Titanic 2, but it more then likely resembles it. besides the fact that there both histoicly sound, there both love stories, there are 3 wars scenes, and only 1 good one! dont let that through you off! the good war scene is approximatly an hour long! it is a great replica of what happened. and it gets you hating Japs!!!!! which is great fun!, it could have been shorter, and maybe a little better casted. I could relate to the characters!, it is inncrediably accurate, thas why it deserevs 4 stars, A blockbuster at its best"
1,What a waste of money.,"I cannot believe they put so much time and money into a movie as [bad] as this one. Even the battle scenes didn't bring any emotion to me. (Not to mention the utter lack of blood and body parts, which made the Pearl Harbor attack scene seem very unrealistic. My friend and I blamed this on the MPAA). The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because my friend and I fast forwarded through over an hour of the movie to get to the war parts.Now that I think of it, I will give this movie only one star because of all the fast forwarding we had to do to see anything of interest in this movie.The only reason I decided to rent this movie was to see what everyone was raving about. Can so many people be wrong about a movie? Why yes, they can."
2,Wasted opportunity,"""Pearl Harbor"" could have been a great Best Picture contender. When watching this film, it is painfully obvious that the makers of this film were using James Cameron's ""Titanic"" as a guide. They should have paid more attention to their own production. This love triangle simply belongs elsewhere. Every good critic knows that it is what made ""Titanic"" an outstanding emotional picture. World War 2 and romance simply do not mix. The attack scene is undeniably spectacular, despite the fact that it becomes tiresome as it progresses. If only Michael Bay could have used Spielberg's ""Private Ryan"" technique, I could be giving this film 5 stars."
1,pearl harbor more like hollywood harbor,"This could have been a great action packed film about the famous battle but instead hollywood turned it into a stupid mushy love triangle that had nothing to do with the battle at all... put out by hollywood they changed details to be ""politically correct"" but all they did was ruin it WW11 veterans are probably and should be angered by this twsiting of history. I suggest don't buy this dvd or watch it isnt worth the money at all i wouldnt pay [$] for it in a sales bin ..."
1,"awful movie, horrible acting, terrible story line",This movie is so horrible I can't bring myself up to write a review for it. The acting is awful and fake. The story is untrue and the entire movie is badly done. I think 1 star is appropriate.
2,Great movie but FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,I have the biggest dvd collection n i already own this movie on dvd but since i bought a new 3d tv with a new bluray 3d home theater system i been buying alot of my favorite movies on bluray only if it has DTS surround sound n this bluray says it has it but it doesnt..Its just plain old dolby d n thats y i gave it the rating that i did
3,"Why Disney had to produce ""Pearl Harbor""?","Disney has produced this anti-Japan movie per China's request in return for the concession of building Disneyland in Hong Kong.In order to understand the reason why Disney had to pay such a painful price, you may be aware that Disney produced the movie ""Kundun"" in 1997 which is chronicling the life of the 14th Dalai Lama from the moment he was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 to his exile from Tibet in the wake of China's invasion.As for the movie ""Pearl Harbor"" itself, this is just a fiction and historically incorrect. Japanese troops never attacked civilians."
3,THIS LOOKS FAMILIAR,"Well, I don't have that much to say on the film, except for the fact that they could have called this ""Titanic 2"". Same love story, just not as interesting because we had seen it all before."
1,A truly woeful film.,"Hollywood take note, good special effects are no substitute for a quality story and good acting. A truly woeful film that had people in the theatre laughing."
1,A stinking poop in the face of moviegoers everywhere,"There's no excuse for this.I'm no snob, but when I saw the slo-mo scene with kids playing baseball startled by evil Japanese fighters coming over the hill -- AND THEN THE LITTLE GIRLS IN THE MIST WEARING LITTLE GAUZY BUTTERFLY WINGS, SKIPPING OBLIVIOUSLY IN SLOMO AS THE ATTACK BEGINS -- oh my! I'd never seen such ham-handed cinematic waste in my life.Just goes to show that you can take a ... script and shallow director, spill for a big marketing budget and cast, and fool a lot of people into spending their hard-earned money to see it."
2,Unevenly Mediocre,"This is one of those films that's able to trivialize even the most earth-shaking historical events. True that the attack sequences are quite good (though they should have relied more on the ILM effects instead of using some very modern-looking mothballed Navy ships as props), but by intertwining a predictable, sappy love-triangle, the action is seriously blunted.The film is tortuously long, largely due to the ""human interest""element that is neither interesting nor very believably human. Could the writers not have come up with something that's just a bit less of a cliche than a love triangle? Of course, moviegoers who long for mental, as well as edible popcorn, will no doubt ""eat it up"".I'm reminded of Shakespeare: ""...a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."""
2,Rent DON'T buy.,"Like most people, I'll agree, the the special effects were great. Having to suffer through what was more like a 30 second melodramtic television commercial turned into an hour and a half - OUCH! Nobody to blame but myself, who bought it? I made it through the first disc, just to see the only good part. Having done that, maybe I'll play the second - one day. On some dreary Sunday when I need a nap. I guess this is what happens when you try to please everybody. I agree with the reviewers that say, watch Tora Tora Tora, for a movie about Pearl Harbour."
1,"""You're heeeeeeeerrrrrrrre....there's NOOOOTHING I feeeaaarrr""","""and I knooooooowwwww that my heart will go ooooooonnnnn""Oh, this wasn't Titanic? My mistake."
2,And two stars go to ... BRAVE JAPANESE PILOTS !!!,"Apart from excellent scenes of the Japanese attack on drunk American pilots and sailors, this film is worthless."
1,'Enemy' denied humanity and believability,"In addition to the historical military inaccuracies which have already been mentioned in detail on these pages, I would add the unfortunate stereotyping of Japan's military leaders as a major negative. Indeed, we are at a time in history where such silly cardboard cut-outs are no longer necessary - if they ever were - in trying to portray the psychological truths that plunged the U.S. and Japan into war with each other.The director was apparently lazy or just stupid. The idiotic rendering of Japanese and things Japanese in this movie dismisses it from serious consideration as a thing of value or merit.It's trash."
1,can your hear the foghorn: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!,"Hollywood's worst formula ever: Take one of America's darkest moments, add a sappy love story between a nurse and two no talent, flava of the month, babyfaces add some forgettable special effects and you get this piece of dribble.I saw it in the theater and after 1 hour coudln't wait for it to end. The love story killed the whole thing. I don't know why Ben Affleck is so popular. Since "" Good Will Hunting"" he has not made one single decent movie. This is his biggest disapointment as well as the biggest disgrace to the people that died at Pearl Harbor. Oh the pain. Like Jim Morrison said in ""Shaman Blues"" ; "" Will you stop, Will you stop....... the pain!"
1,Is this about Pearl Harbor?,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone only interested in seeing a movie about Pearl Harbor. It it a sappy story wrapped around a real event. You must suspend all sense of reality to take in this movie
1,A terrible film,"What were they thinking? Pearl Harbor is nothing more than an attempt to remake Titanic with Japanese Zeroes instead of an iceberg. While not quite ""Postman"" bad, Pearl Harbor's awful acting, terrible dialog, and overall uninspired dross toward a delicate historical event marks this film as one for the bargain bin next to ""Showgirls."""
1,misleading,"I have purchased several Blu Ray titles from Amazon and had no difficulty playing them on my Samsung player. I tried playing this one but the player rejected it each time and reported ""unable to play this disc."" After some investigation, I determined that Blu Ray discs are region encoded, such that a player purchased in North America is only capable of playing discs intended for North America (region A.) Unfortunately, the disc that I got from Amazon is not appropriate for playback on a unit purchased in North America. Look into this before you buy."
1,Over the top fluff!,"Pearl Harbour is a big budget special effects offering from you guessed it Jerry Bruckheimer responsible for such over the top Hollywood films as Armageddon. Micheal Bay director of Bad Boys and The Rock helms this box office terror of a film. Starring one of the worst actors of all time Ben Affleck, the film starts well but ends up in cornville.What could be a powerful movie after the tragic events that took place in Pearl Harbour about sixty years ago is just an excuse to spend money on high quality effects. Pearl Harbour is a no brainer. Stay away please!"
5,Woah!,"This is a really great movie!It keeps you at the edge of your seat.I saw this movie with my BFF at one of our over nights.I woke her up and said""Come on Girl!We gotta see the rest!"" You can just tell I was addictied!It was a blast that is a movie that I love.A movie with some Action,sarrow,romance and at some parts comedey!"
5,VERY GOOD!!!,"This was a amazing movie. The affects were awesome, and the love story helped you to love the characters. It was a very sad movie... but it is one of the best I have ever seen!! BUY IT NOW!!"
3,Put together out of what could've been two or three movies,"I've just watched it and while I don't think Pearl Harbor is nearly as bad as some reviewers do I do think the producers tried to put too much into it. For your time spent viewing it you get a long build up towards what could be called the title segment (for a movie named Pearl Harbor not much of it occured there)followed by what could almost be termed a chunk of another movie entirely (Dolittle's raid on Tokyo). I also thought that the romance angle seemed to almost be another story by itself. Pearl Harbor has some great battle sequences, maybe the best I've seen, and for romance, well, it has that too but I wish things had somehow been handled differently. Buy it for a good idea of what the attack itself might've been like but don't plan on finding it to be a really great movie."
4,History lesson and a love story ...,History lesson and a love story all in one. Movies are entertainment and this DVD was packed with a visual audio and strong parallel story lines. Long on time but held my attention. Please note this was my first DVD viewing and I found it to be memorable. Truly felt as though I was viewing from the movie theatre.This movie should appeal to men and women as the love story can not be viewed as merely a chick flick when there is so much action going on with the war scenes. There is fighting and violence but it is tempered with real emotion and real connection. The friendship portrayed between the two lead male characters is parallel to the love they share for the same women.Just an all around good story!
1,Disasterpice!,"Just befor this movie came out I head that some of the real World War 2 vets. were very upset, because the flim makers had to stick a love story in the movie so Pearl Harbor would become the smash hit it did.If you loved the way overrated Titanic then you will love Peal Harbor, but if your looking for an war movie like the awsome Tora! Tora! Tora! then don't wast your mony on this DVD. No wonder the Japs. were mad at this movie."
1,The worst movie of all time,"A tale filled with mellodramatic love scenes and horrible acting is not my idea of a night at the movies. The movie is filled with corny tearjerkers and portrays little of the actual historical value of Pearl Harbor. Ben Affleck gives one of his worse performances as a man, who, if this movie had any basis in reality would have died in aplane crash. His monotone, undeveloped charecter does little to boost the already pitiful movie. The only reason I gave this movie one star is because of Josh Hartnet, who is not only gorgeous, but also a blossoming actor."
1,Why was it called Pearl Harbor?,"This wasn't about Pearl Harbor, this was about how to tell another stupid love story with half-assed actors appearing to be bigger stars than they really are. If you took out the Pearl Harbor back drop and attack scene (which only last for about 10 min. in this long 3 hour movie), this would be another bad love story. Pearl Harbor was used as a way to get viewers to see another dumb Ben Affleck movie. I felt dupped. I wanted to see a story about PH and got this mess instead."
2,"Great Special Effects, but Lousy Movie","The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor as shown here was incredible. But I wonder why (yes, our intelligence did make mistakes in not picking up on the attack until too late) that most of the U.S. service men are made out to be complete incompetents? There are bombs exploding everywhere, and most of the sailors run around screaming! Were we that badly trained, or did we need Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck there to help save the day? The love story is completely boring and predictable. Factual inaccuracies abound. For an expensive movie, they sure cut on fact-checkers and script writers! Rent the movie, fast-forward to the attack scenes, and don't waste your time on the rest of this drivel!"
1,Too bad the ratings do not go negative!,"Other than special effects, I find nothing memorable about this film. The misinterpretation of historic fact borders on the hysterical, and to some degree almost criminal. The film does a diservice to all those who perished in the attack, and especially those who survived and fought to keep America free. For those who are interested in Pearl Harbor, and are looking for a more accurate portrayal, get Tora Tora Tora. This movie should die a unlamented death."
3,Do not buy this! Wait till Jan. 2002,Wait until January to buy this! They have a 3disc one coming out soon!
2,Big Historical Issues,"You won't be watching this one in Mr. Smith's History class. The only historically accurate part of this movie was that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. I'm even surprised they got that right in this film. The fact that I'm a huge WWII History buff makes this movie almost completely useless from a history point of view. Hollywood defiantly worked their charm on this one. Anyway, there were some good scenes during the raid if you fast-forward an hour and a half to get to them so you can miss all the chick flick stuff. I did like the tie-in between Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid even though they had nothing to do with each other and none of the pilots from Pearl even flew in it. (Another big history issue) Over all though, it had some really nice special effect during the raid. So if you're into good war special effects there are about 45 minutes to an hour of that good stuff."
1,Movie with an identity crisis,"Too much romance to be a war movie. Too much war to be a romance movie. Whatever you want to call this hodgepodge of dramatic cliches, don't dare call it ""historical."" Like ""Titanic,"" which suffers from a similar affliction, the fact that celluloid was even wasted on this is supremely insulting to the real people who actually lived through the events. The worst aspect of it is that it was obviously intended as a means to purely commercial ends, riding into theaters on the coattails of far more artistically and morally distinguished movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" and the groundswell of renewed interest in World War II which followed them.If you want to watch a reasonably accurate dramatization of what actually happened at Pearl Harbor, your money will be better spent on the classic ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"""
3,Josh Hartnett is so cute!,A pretty good movie overall though I think they could have cut out some of the romantic [stuff]. Cuba Gooding Jr. was excellent. Ben Affleck was alright and Josh Hartnett was great. (and cute.) The digital effects were great or as great as it gets if you're blowing people up.
5,I enjoyed it,"I love Pearl Harbor! I was very happy to get Pearl Harbor Vista Series Director's Cut. It had more blood in some parts of the movie, but over all it was very good. I enjoyed seeing some of the scenes that were deleted from the regular movie. I also like the bonus footage of Ben affleck, Josh Hartnett, and some of the other male actors in boot-camp. If you liked Pearl Harbor then you will enjoy Pearl Harbor Vista Series Director's Cut."
3,Let the creditcs talk but they wearnt war veterns wear they?,"YES in a little way it did copy Titanic it is a love storyIt involes an actual real life tragity and just like titanic somewhat copyed Gone with the wind..Well anywaythis movie somewhat makes Titanic seem shortI watched this movie wiht a grandfarther and he is a korea and vietname war vertern and YES I Know he wasent in Pearl HArbor but he has a good idea of war,, and just like a lot of war veterns ive talked to about this movie he agreed""Its to much Hollywood not enough actual war involed"" since it claims to be a romance/war movie you can keep the romance part but take out the War Gore Area............Yes its a classic so Buy itThe DVD its self is pretty good it is just annoying to siwtch disc's thows.. The Speical fueatures are GREAT!"
2,"A lot like Armageddon, but not as entertaining.","If you thought Armageddon was cheesy, wait until you see Pearl Harbor. It's almost as if Michael Bay just said ""how can I do everything I did wrong in Armageddon, and multiply it tendfold?"" They really should have cut everything around the fight scene and just shown that. I've never seen something in such desperate need for editing. The plot went on and on, and the love story was dull and cookie-cutter. It wasn't a decent love story like in Titanic, it was a miserably boring and uninvolving story about two people you don't care about.The only redeeming qualities of this film come from the special effects on the attack of Pearl Harbor. If they had just cut out all the other stuff and left this in, it might make for a nice Discovery Channel special. As a feature-length (and more) film that is supposed to keep you entertained for 3 hours, it leaves very little."
1,Rewrite of History,"This is the worst rewrite of history in the past thirty years! And it is amazing that Hollywood considers Ben Affleck an actor. Good Gracious, where are the Van Johnsons' and Gregory Pecks'of our time gone? Can you believe Alec Baldwin playing Colonel Jimmy Doolittle? That my friends, is an insult. Don't waste your dollars."
1,Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?,"I really can't sum up this flaming pile of turd any better than Trey Parker already has:I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the markwhen he made Pearl Harbor.I miss you more than that movie missed the pointand that's a lot girl. And now, now you've gone awayand all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor suckedand I miss you.I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school.He was terrible in that film.I need you more than Cuba Gooding needed a bigger part.He's way better than Ben Affleck and now,all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor sucked and I miss you.Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies???I guess Pearl Harbor sucked just a little bit more thanI miss you."
1,Truly awful and disrespectful of a real life tragedy,"A spectacularly great example in the Ben Affleck Museum of Mediocrity. It would be just dreadful, but its more the lack of humility and the debasing of a real tragedy that elevates this to the status of truly awful.This is like writing a cheap romance around 9/11 with lots of slow-mo shots of Ben and Jen running from the falling buildings to the sound of Aerosmith. I hope I haven't given the producers an idea for a sequel."
5,Special gift,"Our granddaughter requested a copy for her birthday after seeing it in school, This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product. I would recommend them without reservation."
3,DONT PAY FOR THE BLU RAY,I OWN THIS MOVIE ON SPECIAL EDITION DVD THE FILM COMPANY REALLY DID A GREAT JOB THE MOVIE SHOWS A REAL HISTORY IN THE USA..HOW EVER IF U ARE LOOKING FOR THE BLU RAY EDITION IS JUST A BIG WASTE OF MONEY..I DONT KNOW HOW THEY DID IT BUT IS THE SAME QUALITY AS THE REGULAR DVD..A FRIEND OF MINE PAID $14 DOLLARS FOR THE USED BLU RAY SOONEST IT CAME OUT..THINKING THAT IT WAS GONNA SOUND AND LOOK BETTER..FROM WHAT I SAW IS ALL THE SAME QUALITY NO CHANGES.
1,Some good laughs and a lot of eye rolling,"The actual recreation of the bombing of Peal Harbor, as breathtaking and technologically marvelous as it was, was not enough to save this dopey movie. Horrible writing, a cliche-ridden plot and some phone-it-in performances gave many scenes an almost comical flare. More than once during the first thrity minutes did I have to elbow my wife to stop laughing or making cracks at the WB/UPN teen drama-like dialogue.It's not the concept of the love triangle as the movie's secondary plot that's the problem. It's that it's a horribly done love triangle. They went full tilt for a Titanic-type love story and failed miserably. Instead of pulling at the heart strings, the movie only manages to by sappy - and at times, very funny.Great special effects. Bad movie."
3,This was actually two separate movies...,"The cliched love triangle of the 3 main characters who display all of the depth and nuance of an oak barrel and the action scenes. The other characters are merely props saying such overused historical one liners such as ""Have we awakened a sleeping giant?"" (truly awe-inspiring). The movie deserves credit for its fine photographic work and first rate special effects. If I could rate each piece separately, it would be 5 stars for F/x and 1 star for the story. It is sad that such an important event in our history was used as a prop to support an incredibly banal plot. If you waited to see this on video, consider yourself lucky. Finally, the film was far too long. There was nothing of any significance of any of these characters that should have taken more than 5 minutes to develop."
3,I can't believe that I watched another Machael Bay movie...,"..but I did.On Thursday, we came home after having dinner with one of our customers, and found my brother-in-law (who's staying with us for a few days) just starting to watch Pearl Harbor. (It was subtitled, of course, in Chinese.)So, I sat down to watch it, and was mildly entertained.I've watched some good films, and bad films. This was in the middle. Michael Bay usually falls into two traps with his films: big action montage scenes, and cliched lines. Both are in evidence here, but the big action montage scenes actually do come in handy during the scenes detailing the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. I guess it's one of those times in which a weakness turns out to be a strength under certain circumstances.So, while I wouldn't recommend seeking this film out as a life mission, I wouldn't run away from it, screaming, either. How's that for ""damned by faint praise""? I think this was better than The Island, though."
2,a five star attack is bookended by a two star romance that was old hat in 1941 and is just bad now.,"michael bey's ""pearl harbor"" is one of those ""what could have been "" movies. with a screen play that would have been laughed at in 1941, mr bey has tied his great f/x scenes of the attack, to a love story that is the last word in corny. the number of times logic is given up in favor of the sappy love story just kills this flawed take on america's darkest day(9/11 not withstanding)!! at nearly three and a half hours it goes on forever and really after the attack there isn't much story left to tell. a very big miss fire from mr. bey and company!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Touchstone ruins disaster movies!,"When I first saw Armageddon, i thought it was going to be a good disaster movie with plenty of action, but all it really was was Ben Affleck smooching someone. That is the same with Pearl Harbour. There is hardly no action, all there is, is romance and Ben Affleck asking a girl to go out with him. I wish some studios would trash the romance and put some mroe work into the disaster seens."
2,Not a good movie at all.,"I don't know how I got through life not knowing anything about Pearl Harbor, but I did. The movie was informative but not really all that good. There was a lot in this movie that could have been left out. The characters were a little boring and the story dragged on."
3,"Movie, so-so: DVD great!","Even if you weren't that impressed with this movie, this DVD is so worth buying! The extra features are really impressive. In addition to an attractive package with a nice booklet and vintage postcards, the DVDs themselves are full of commentaries, documentaries, and other goodies, giving a lot of insight into what the movie makers had in mind. The movie itself I give 5 stars for looks and 1 star for plot and character development. (A 2-dimensional love story somewhat trivializes an important historical event.) But, boy does it look good! If you are a film buff, I think you'd find the extras on the DVD outweigh the lackluster movie itself."
1,"""SUCKED""","This was the worst film of 2001 but the DVD is good. Ben Affleck was the worst actor in the film. I give Kate Beckinsale a razzie for her smile. I give Josh Hartnett a razzie for crying. And Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself for turning something Historical into trash. If you want to see something great about Pearl Harbor, go see ""Tora Tora Tora""."
1,I Hated This Movie!,"I love Ben Affleck. I love Ben Affleck in tank tops or otherwise snug shirts. That alone is not enough to make a movie, though. I thought this movie was dreadful. Abysmal. Hackneyed, trite plot mechanisms, historically off-base in many ways, and an insult to the memories of the people who really lived and died at Pearl Harbor to serve up tripe like this as ""tribute."" You want to learn about Pearl Harbor? Go to the library, or down to the VFW and ask someone. But save your money and do not bother with this stinker."
1,Who would have thought they could make Pearl Harbor boring?,"Pearl Harbor was supposed to be a combination of action, history, and romance, along the lines of the far superior Titanic. Unlike Titanic, this movie has a terrible script, moronic dialogue, mediocre acting, confused and distorted history, and nothing worthwhile to say about life, love, war, or anything else. I found myself squirming in my seat and looking at my watch for the first 1 1/2 hour of this movie. In short, one of the very worst big-budget movies in many years. Anyone looking for somewhat realistic WWII action flics should consider Tora, Tora, Tora; Midway, or A Bridge Too Far. One of the finest films about WWI was the Australian production Gallipoli. Any one of these on video or DVD is a better pick than Pearl Harbor."
3,"Good movie, historically flawed but good","Okay, I have a true love about the history of World War 2 having started to study it almost from when I could first read. The movie seems to poke a finger at America for not becoming involved in the war sooner, after all America only came in at the end of 1941 for a war that ended in 1945 while Britain was there from 1939. The film producer's state that they were being fair towards Japan in the movie but a total of 10 minutes in a movie of 3 hours is not long enough.The battle scene is spectacular and this is the part of the movie that really scores a good number of points. However, the love story in the movie just didn't seem to have any relevance to what was supposed to be a historical account and brings it down. Wallace wrote Braveheart without any significant love story but crams one into Pearl Harbour, which makes it lose points."
5,A different twist on Pearl Harbor,"Granted this movie does not cover Pearl Harbor like ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" It is Pearl Harbor from a different view. The love triangle was good as two friends overcome the rivaliry for the same woman's affection to watch each others back in Japan. FDR standing up after the attack could become memorable. The movie also does a excellent job of protraying blacks."
5,One of the best movies of the year!,"I really enjoy this movie. I was stunned by the special effects when those Japaneses bombed those ships. Really shows how terrible the day of December 7, 1941 was. And the plot was great too. Everyone did a great job to make this movie amazing. I recommend to buy the DVD, not only able to select your favourite scenes but also able to find out how those special effects were made."
2,Bummer,Visual effects and Battle footage were great...the other 85% of the movie was just lousy fluff...
1,Bad history and bad subtitles,"I was very disappointed with the DVD version of this innacurate and boring movie and definitely will not buy the Director's Cut when it comes out next year. An additional aggravation was the use of a very tiny font for the subtitles in the Japanese language scenes. I was sitting about 10 feet away from a 20"" TV and could hardly read them! I ended up turning on the Spanish subtitles (English closed-captioning was not available for the Japanese language scenes) in order to understand what was going on!"
4,Pearl Harbor Blu-ray Review,A home theater sound system makes this movie the one that shows off all that blu-ray can do. You can't beat a great story and great cinematography either.
1,Absolutely the WORST war movie ever made.,"This thing is utter and complete garbage from beginning to end. It has absolutely NO historical accuracy whatsoever except that the Japanese did in fact speak Japanese. Other than that, pretty much everything's pure poorly researched fantasy. This is not only a terrible waste of time and money, the fictional story it tells isn't any good either. It's rubish."
2,some good scenes,"I was quite looking forward to this film, my only worry was that like most hollywood films, it may consentrate on being be very pro american as opposed to being accurate? in its favour, some of the scenes are spectacular (pearl harbor especially) but ultimately my main fear was recognised. it really is a great tribute for the brave american service men, but thats just my point...... the americans for example (and my biggest problem with this film) the battle of britain scene (a battle that America wouldnt get involved with!). 507 british pilots lost their lives during theses months as well as many polish, canadian and australian men etc that came over to help out. over 10.000 civillians were also killed in bombing raids. and was this portrayed in the film..... No? ben affleck single handedly won the battle of Britain in 5 minutes? what a hero. if this hollywood nonsence is what you like then you will love pearl harbor, if not then stay away!"
1,"Hilarious, a comedy tonic","This movie deserves a star in recognition of the work the crew put in and for nothing else.Seeing the shorts was enough for me, there was no way I would actually pay to see this movie. But tonight I watched some of it on TV and cried with laughter. Why? The storyline was dire, the acting was embarrassing and the dialogue made me think of steaming elephant excrement. It is difficult to find the words to describe how truly awful this movie is. It is worth watching only for the side splitting laughter factor and very relaxing. The only serious element is that some poor deluded fools might think that this is historically accurate. All it does is to illustrate how badly prepared and complacent the USA was in 1941. But any accuracy is totally submerged by the pure garbage that surrounds it and you would have to be mentally retarded to take any of it seriously. If laughter is a health tonic though this is the elixir of life."
1,come on now...,"They made the trailer look all sweet like it was going to a good war movie, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Saving Private Ryan"" <--great movie by the way, but this was total [junk], it wasn't a war movie, it was a cheesy, mediocre love story with a little bit of action in between. Why do you think they rated it PG-13? I think it's so ""everyone"" could go see it, to make tons of money, and not offend anyone (except for those of us with taste)"
4,A Terrific Looking Film,"Though the story line may lag a bit, Michael Bay has the director's eye for realism. It looks and feels like the 40s. Some of the best war film effects ever. I found the attack and subsequent battle scenes to be spectacular. Outstanding cinematography and sound, you can't beat it for viewing on your Home Theater system. Not the best plot, though I've seen much worse, still visually stunning. The first purchase in my DVD collection."
1,"Better described as ""Pearl Horror""","Unfortunately, I can't give this zero stars, much less negative numbers . . .I've seen better writing on cereal boxes."
1,"Only reason it gets 1 star is because there isn't a ""0""","I see many people picking it apart because it's historically inaccurate. That didn't bother me so much as the fact that it ""felt"" like watching 2 movies, both of which were horrible. A 30 minute clip of CGI graphics of the most weasel-like thing this country has ever had done to it, and then 2+ hours of the lamest romance movie ever. I felt like I had been tricked into watching a chick flick, with a few explosions in the middle of it. This movie should go to the ""Land of Misfit Toys"" or something similar, never to be seen again."
2,good but not THAT good,This is a good movie but not great. It's way too long and the actors are not really that good. The special effects are amazing to look at but it gets boring after a while. Jennifer Garner had a very small role in the movie. Why didn't she got a bigger part is beyond me. This unrated version is not that special only has a lot more gore/violence. Why did I waste time and money on this one I really don't know. If you love violence movies buy this now if now avoid it at all costs.
3,3 and a half actually...,"Pearl Harbor, I expected, would be a movie like Titanic. I knew it would stay away from past efforts to portray the attack on the harbor, and I also knew the film would be different. The film isn't a masterpiece but I enjoyed watching the portrayal. At some points in the film is was almost like watching a discovery channel documentary, and you lost sight of the plot. There were not any horrible performances. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, and Cuba Gooding Jr. all did very well. The movie was a little slow at times. The attack was the focal point of the film and everything after that was dull. It is not a failure but definately not a triumph."
1,Disney lays big one at Pearl,"I had nothing to do one night. This was on television.I am glad I neither purchased this nor went to the theater. I only wasted my time not my money.The only scene worth watching was the one of the Japanese Plane dropping its bomb on the Arizona. That was superb. The rest bombed.The scenery was fine. Special effects wonderful.Cuba Gooding Jr did a fair job acting. Everyone else stank.The story was plotless and strangling in its own mediocrity.The love triangle with Ben Afleck and the other two was forgetable. His portrayal as a Yank in the RAF more pathetic than the plot that got him to Pearl Harbor.Overall there were two big bombs at Pearl Harbor, the one that sank the Arizona and this one."
1,"Terrible, Terrible Movie","This is one of the worst WWII movies I have ever seen. Very overrated. If you want to see an outstanding WWII movie, go see Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Intelligent movies that are very historically accurate. Don't go waste your money on this piece of crap."
3,Titanic Revisited,"With so much material, I don't know why the makers of this film tried to remake the Titanic (guess it was for the money)...Don't get me wrong, the film wasn't bad, but I was expecting a historical war movie (maybe I should stick to the History Channel or wait until Mel Gibson takes up this type of film).The reenactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor redeemed the film from me - very realistic and much easier to stomach than the love triangle fodder..."
3,Hawaii was better!!!,"I went to the World Premiere of this movie onboard USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74), in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. I covered the arrival of the survivors and stars of the movie on the red carpet. When I got up to the flightdeck, where the movie was shown. I lasted about 10 minutes before I decided that Hawaii was more interesting, so I left."
3,"Good historical info, bad plot","The love story plot in this movie is very bad and predictable. However, the cinematography and special effects in the attack sequences is worth watching. The movie is depressing, but helps to bring the viewer an understanding of the horrorific attack at Pearl Harbor and its effect on the U.S. It is especially hard-hitting after the events of 9/11. The dvd also includes a special about Pearl Harbor produced by the History Channel which is quite informative. Worth renting."
5,"Well, today's the day....","Well, Pearl Harbor comes out to DVD today, Dec. 4th. Just 3 days before the ACTUAL historical bombing. I wonder if they are going to do some kind of special on TV or something in light of the Sept. 11th events.I don't know about some of the people on this board, but I'm going to buy the Pearl Harbor DVD. It was a good movie (in my opinion), and the DVD has plenty of features. Even some historical features for you historical buffs out there.THe rated-R version (DIrector's CUt) DVD is coming out next year, and that one is supposed to be spectacular. 3 disks, with LOADS of historical footage, behind the scenes of the movie, and all this other stuff."
5,Awesome,I believe that this movie is up to Titanic's standards. Although you will hear a lot of negative feedback about the movie watch it with a romantic heart and definetly a box of Kleenexs and you will enjoy this epic tale of Romance and Sadness about love being lost.
1,From Here to Blech,"There isn't much to say. The movie was cheezy and I liked it better when it was called ""From Here to Eternity."""
3,Bad ?,"I'm sure why so many hated this, especially guys. Sure it has a mooshy romance sub-plot, repeat sub-plot but it still has it's marcho guy war stuff in there as well. Plus I really liked the performances, especially Josh Hertnett who steals the show from Afflick. The one perfomance that I think deserves oscar consideration though is John Voight, he was so good that you would think he was Anthony Hopkins in this movie. He really deserves it, even if you didn't like the movie I doubt you could disagree.I found the war scenes that most people called cartoonish very engaging and well done. The only bad things are that it's too long, the whole love triangle thing is predictible and it trys too hard to be dramatic. Oh yeah plus Cuba Gooding Jr. is pretty much playing the same role he had in Men of Honor. Other than that I was really into this film and had trouble seeing where it was actually......bad."
2,*takes out the tissue*,"Yep, many people cried in this movie, proclaimed it as ""one of the most touching, heartfelt movies ever"".I think not. But that's just me. I have many reasons why I gave this movie such a low rating. Firstly, it didn't live up to its hype. It was supposed to be a movie depicting the events that took place at Pearl Harbor, but then it seemed to me as if it focused more on the cliched love triangle between the leading roles than what it claimed to.*takes back the tissue* And it even failed to touch me very much, even with 2 hours of non-stop emotion.The 2 stars came from the brief war scene, its pseudo-saving grace.I don't recommend this film, lest you're into romance and such. Or if you liked Titanic."
3,Cool...,"The special effects in Pearl Harbor are one of it's strong points. True, the movie itself drew less than favorable reviews, but you still should add it to your collection just for the sheer scale of the production. The attack sequences are impressive to say the least."
4,"Extremley realistic cinematography,good F/x's","Watching this movie,I can only imagine how brutal the attack on Pearl Harbor was.Combination of a chick flick and a monster man movie...one or the other."
5,THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"This is the best movie, and even that's an understatement. It had everything...It made me laugh, cry, and I learned stuff along the way that I didn't before. The cast is amazing and the story line is perfect. I really loved this movie and I think everyone else will too. Plus, it had Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck, two major hotties, so it can't be all that bad, right?"
5,Best Movie Ever,"I took my girlfriend to see this movie, we both loved it. Great SFX, great story and just a great movie. Gives you plenty of time to snuggle close. Good movie and we are definatly going to buy it. (...) This was a terrific movie!"
5,What the heck is everyone else talking about??!!,"Simply put: the best damn movie I ever saw! It's at least as long as Titanic, but you don't feel like you're sitting there that long. Awesome movie!!!!"
2,"I'm not a chick flick fan... not after ""Pearl Harbor""...","I think this must've been the strategy behind the making of ""Pearl Harbor"": some girls wanted to take their boyfriends to a chick-flick-in-disguise. They added a battle scene or two, and voila! ""Pearl Harbor"" was born. I got to see this movie first as extra credit for a humanities class; the teacher shouldn't have bothered, because ""Pearl Harbor"" had very little to do with actual history. Most of the movie was bogged down in a sappy, overused love triangle, not to mention the improbability of a downed pilot coming back from the dead. Then, at the end, the Doolittle raid convieniently removed one of the men from the scene. Strange how perfectly things worked out for the other guy... Cliched lines and a syrupy plot make this one to avoid for all but diehard fans of the bushy-eyebrowed Hartnett and cleft-chinned Affleck."
2,Coulda shoulda woulda...,"This movie should have been entitled ""Have you had enough yet?"". The character buildup in this one was OUTRAGEOUS..and led you nowhere. I bought this movie for Historical ACTION.. and instead got, well.. ROMANCE. The main theme (I should say DRAG) of this flick was not the attack on Pearl Harbor, but rather the ridiculously predictable love triangle of two pilots and a nurse.While slightly entertaining, if only to see Benny go down in flames, I wouldn't have paid full price if I'd known the full gist of romantic lunacy this one offered up in huge steaming piles.If your into a long drawn out plot (if it can be called that) and very little else, get this, you'll love it, Otherwise move on with no regrets or just watch tape 2."
2,Not Up To It's Peers,"There are and have been much better war dramas - Tora, Tora, Tora, for example. The story is primarily about a love triangle that just happens to involve two pilots - but that fact is really unnecessary to the story itself. The love story itself could have been by and between any three people who happened to be in Hawaii when the Japanese attack took place. The story wasn't historically accurate but the performances kept it from being a total disaster. I'd pass on buying this. If you must - rent it."
1,History Perverted by Hollywood,"This was the absolute, most terrible movie I've ever seen. It was historically inaccurate and filled with every romantic-drama cliche there is. If Michael Bay wanted to make a romance, he could left history out of it. I think the event of Pearl Harbor itself is quite dramatic enough for a film, without having to add sex and betrayal. The saddest part is that people are actually going to watch this movie think that FDR actually drew attention to his disability so blatantly, when in fact he never would have done anything like struggle to his feet that way. And no one died on the Doolittle Raid. Only Kamakaze pilots wore the rising sun head bands and they weren't used until 1944. And turning the struggle that followed the attack into a game of chicken? The utter disrespect for the people who suffered through Pearl Harbor is abhorent and I cannot believe that more people do not feel this way."
2,Pearl Harbor Blu-ray,"Another disappointing re-make, the picture ""flutter"" in the action scenes is terrible, compared to the just released ""Troy"" which is a fabulous piece of work, even on my high def plasma, this one does not cut the ice and is most certainly not worth the hefty price tag."
1,"Actually, less than one star.","This movie is garbage. It is useful for two things. One, as an instructional video on ""How To Recognize Horrible Movies"", and two, as a comedy. A comedy in the sense that the acting and dialogue is laughable. Don't buy Peral Harbor for the laughs though. Wait till A.I. comes out. It's much funnier."
1,Titanic meet Hawaii!,"This is the worst movie of the decade, a big commercial piece for the U.S. and the acting and directing is also bad. But the special effects must be the worst I've ever seen! Do they mean to have a ""Toy Story-sky"" and plastic bombs??"
5,Pearl Harbor DVD,"The process of buying the DVD went very smoothly. I knew what I wanted, found it at a great price, and purchased it. I received the product in a timely manner and it was in great shape."
3,good to some extent,"This movie was not bad; the flying sequences were good, the love scene was good and the attack itself was portrayed excellently, but the only problem lies in a whole lot of little things that were either wrong or unecassary. Such as the Doolittle raid scene.....what was the point of it!!!!!!!!.....and in history there was no pilot from pearl harbour who participated in the doolittle raid, and there was not a pilot who fought for the british and fought at pearl harbor..........................3/5"
3,an ok movie,I thought this movie was a good movie it wasn't a great historical masterpiece it was a summer blockbuster movie and people should know that and like most people I like blockbusters Ben aflek is my favorite actor and he does a good job in this movie the attack on pearl harbor its self is spectacular
1,Pearl-less Harbor,"Not a Pearl of a movie. Very uninteresting. The action bombing scenes use a lot of gasoline, but little else. Go get ""Tora Tora Tora"" and see the real thing."
1,Trash,Formulaic garbage that should appeal to the less intellectually gifted 15 year olds.Absolutely laughable.
1,whats was this movie about again?,"If not for the title you could have made this movie about anything because thats what it TRIED to be was everything to everyone and what it ends up being is over produced crap. I had heard from everyone i knew that this movie had missed the mark but you cant funnly understand how far until you waste 3 hours viewing it. Probably the longest 3 hours of my life, obsolutely awful."
2,Peal Harbor,Peal Harbor Is to OOOwy For a war MovieIt's More Love then war. It's Lack ActionAll you See of most of the movie Is UselessLove. Alltrough it had one good Battle sceenThat It it's not enogh. Saving Private RyanIs Hardcore But Peal Harbor NotThis is not a hardcore Movie if youLike action Movies and Hardcore war MoviesSkip this one it's not worth spenading your moneyfor.
1,pass the sick bucket,What an unbeleivably stupid film. Full of corny and sentimental american ideas from start to finish.
2,A disappointment,"I was very eager to see Pearl Harbor. I wanted to see how one of the most tragic days in American history would be translated to film. I was sure I would be satisfied with it... but I wasn't. Pearl Harbor is big-budget garbage. It takes a depressing day in history and turns it into a ... love story with pretty special effects. The attack on Pearl Harbor was entertaining, but not nearly enough to save this movie. Even the historical backround in the movie is off at times. Pearl Harbor should have been made similiar to Saving Private Ryan: cold, dark, and bloody. An R-rating would have helped, but Disney must have been too set on making Pearl Harbor a family film. Don't waste your time with Pearl Harbor, watch Tora! Tora! Tora! for a good take on December 7, 1941."
4,Great Movie,"I know alot of ppl have said that they didnt like this movie, and hey thats them. I for one loved it. I'm in the Marines, I serve my country with great honor and pride. Just as those of did during WWII. This movie makes you feel proud to be an American cause when terror struck us from afar we did not go down quitely. We rose up as a nation to fight a evil that chose to tempt us, just as the events the events have on September 11, 2001. This movie shows that America as nation will pull together in a time of need, we will fight to the death to protect our family, friends and loved ones.Like I said its a great movie, long but one worth buying. Every great movie has its faults, as this one did. The battle sence's are not as long as I had hoped, but they are awsome. It would have been nice if they could have shown the bomb drop and how Japan surrendered, and how we defeted Germany and won but that would have made the movie so long. All in all its just as good as any other war movie."
2,Not worth the time,"I was real disappointed in this movie, especially after looking forward to a modern day portrayal of the attack at Pearl Harbor. Yes, there were some good special effects and big explosions (the only thing keeping this from one star), but overall this missed the mark. Why? Mainly because of the hokey love story that was the main premise of the movie. People go to a movie title ""Pearl Harbor"" to see what happened at Pearl Harbor, not to follow some corny love triangle superimposed on the attack. Basically, this is a chick-flick disguised as a war movie, and it doesn't work.If you want to see about Pearl Harbor, rent ""Tora Tora Tora"". If you want a love story, rent ""Titanic"". Stay away from this one. It's not worth the time."
1,"Long, so long",This movie was longer then any movie I've ever seen. I aged five years during it. Never in my life have I been more bored or filled with more hatred for a film.
2,MOVIE IS TOO ROMANTICIZE,"Why does Hollywood romanticize war?? Pearl Harbor was a time of shock and horror. But yet, Hollywood turns it into a romantic movie. I was very disappointed with the movie because of this. Hollywood failed in my eyes to show how America failed to take Japan seriously, especially when valuable information was intercepted. If they did, I must of selpt through it. Instead, Hollywood chose to show 2 guys in love with the same girl. Both guys go to war. At the end of the movie, guy #2 wins her heart.The attack scenes were very realistic. I'm surprise Hollywood didn't add more romance during the scenes!!"
1,could have been great,"This movie could have been awesome. The battle scenes are incredible,but the movie is murdered by an over elabrote and drawn out love story that adds about an hour and a half to the movie that could have been used to explore other issues like, THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR FOR INSTANCE!"
2,What a waste...,"Alot was expected out of this potentially-epic film. One of the greatest tragedy in American history brought down to a measly romance film SET during the Pearl Harbor attack.Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing aginst romance films...unless it gets in the way of the important things in the movie...like everything else beside the romance, in this case.Bah! Maybe I was expecting a classic like Platoon or A Thin Red Line. Or the eastern hemisphere version of Saving Private Ryan.My advice? Don't buy, rent or wait til its Television premere."
3,Pearl Harbor,"Michael Bay's re-creation of the historic Pearl Harbour is a visually stunning, yet emotionally puerile film that lacks the frenetic fun of Bay's earlier films. Why Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay ever considered this mammoth of a movie is anyone's idea (stick to dumb action films guys), and the love triangle of Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale is frankly mind-numbingly-awful. While the huge battle scenes for the attack on Pearl Harbor are impressive, the film loses stars for being far too cardboard and unrealistic. But it is impossible to deny that the colossal battle scenes, bombs, big things exploding and action are really good, making for an impressive action film that is enjoyable if you can stand the yucky emotion."
3,It's just a movie,"... I doubt seriously that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer felt they had a legitimate Oscar contender with this film. Not every screenplay is Braveheart. Just ask Bryan Singer.It's just a movie. Entertainment. And on that merit, I found it quite enjoyable. Never have I seen a movie portray the bombing of Pearl Harbor in this way. And the love triangle, though admittedly cliche, did nothing but show that people did, in fact, live on the island before, during, and after the attack.No, it's not Saving Private Ryan or Titanic. It's Pearl Harbor. It isn't great, but it isn't awful. It's a fun night at the movies."
3,This movie is fake.,"This movie was very fake and wierd.The action was fake and so was the love story that took up about 85 mins of the movie.The 45 mins of action was ok,but fake.This movie has alot of flaws in it that you can find easily.This movie was ok but needed a little work.The ending wasa very sad and heartbreaking to see."
4,The love story isn't good.,"I didn't like the love story very much.The 65 mins of action was terrific with some of the best special effects i've ever seen.The Japanese actors were good at playing their roles.The music was good,but when Rafe dies and comes back was very silly.The scene where Danny tells Rafe to be the father wasn't good."
5,Way better than Titanic,This is the best movie i've seen since Saving Private Ryan.It will surly top the charts and even Titanic.This movie will take some Oscars.Don't listen to the critics because their so wrong.
3,Alright.,"The special effects are flawless and some of the best i've seen.That didn't come close to its epic proportions is what'll probably disappoint viewers most.It did me.Hopefully,the importance of the event itself was not lost or trivalized.If you have to ask why its important,than you wouldn't understand anyway."
4,I give it a 4.,In the end Pearl Harbor hits its target with solid performances by Hartnett and Affleck and its incredible special effects.
5,An Epic,The First Hour is Smaltsy but once the Attack begins the Movie is incredible. It definately does not feel like an 3hr movie.
2,Its an O.K. movie... but why is it called Pearl Harbor?,"Does anyone understand the title of this movie? The main idea of the story isn't even about Pearl Harbor... its about two friends in the military; with a twisted love story mixed in. The actually Pearl Harbor scene didn't take up much of the movie's plot, just a fraction of the time... and the movie is made to seem to be dragged on. But I guess what do I expect... this is a hollywood film.If your expecting this movie to be a war movie (like I was), then you'll be disapointed... but if you want to see a drama/romance, then you'll probably enjoy it."
2,"A ""Pearl"" of great price it is not!","After hearing all the hype for this movie, I was extremely disappointed. They had a great opportunity to make an epic movie and squandered it. I'm sure there were enough real life stories at Pearl Harbor that day that would have been more interesting than the bogus love story they went with."
2,Another split 2-disc movie?,"I don't get it. There's no bigger turn off than a DVD movie that has been split onto 2 DVDs. What's the excuse?? Give me one good reason why you can't fit the whole movie on one Digital Versatile Disc. Better image quality you say? That's total BS. DVDs were made for an immense storage capacity. You could fit three perfect versions of Pearl Harbor on one disc without losing .01% of video or audio quality. So what the hell is their excuse? It's just the same as the Godfather Part II in the box set. Why the hell 2 discs? What a joke. I repeat, ""WHAT A JOKE."""
2,Pearl Harbor,"Good maximum effort and great special effects and pyrotechnics. But weak story. The movie was way too cliche and a no brainer. Everything from the train station farewell (how times did that appear in movies, a favorite among parodies) to Alec Baidwin making a speeches about the USA not losing the war because of men like Ben Affleck and Josh Hartlett. Very propagandic that is reminiscent of World War II-era Hollywood films. The Japanese sequences seemed to be done in a rush. And anyone noticed that Affleck didn't have trouble reading those love letters even though he was dyslexic?"
3,"Not a great drama, but worth it for the action scenes","For those demanding great drama, forget about it. It's an OK, shlocky love story; it was enough to hold my interest, but frankly, too long leading up the the payoff.That said, the battle scenes were excellent. Historically accurate? Dunno. But they're fast paced eye-candy, and if that appeals to you, I'd highly recommend them."
1,Why are they turning history films into chick flicks?,I thought the whole point of this movie was to see the story of Pearl Harbor and guess what it's not. It's the same like Titanic. We see another chick flick movie without telling us any history. I got pretty disappointed with this one and it's nothing but girls talkin about how guys are cute in this movie. It also gets annoying too. Saving Private Ryan was probably one of my favorite war movies of all time and I think it's a true story too and there's no chick flick in it thank goodness but movies like Pearl Harbor and Titanic are overrated and don't give us any history information. The attack of Pearl Harbor don't really happen till near the end. If you want to see a better true story movie go watch Blackhawk Down or Saving Private Ryan those are better than watching these cheap chick flick rip offs.
1,Utterly horrendous,"Possibly the worst WWII movie ever made. I'm in awe of Hollywood's current estimation of it's story telling abilities. That anyone could think this ""version"" of the history of Pearl Harbor was either a legitimate or entertaining one is truly beyond me. I weep with the realization than millions of people derive their view of history from this kind of tripe."
1,"Boring, inacurate, superficial, what more can I say!","First off let me say that if Kate Beckinsale's character was a plain woman do you really think that those two guys would still fall in love with her?, hmmm I wonder! I have yet to see a movie of this caliber have a story like that {that would be absolutely sweet}. Also this film is an insult to the actual events that took place on that terrible day, not only to the dead but also the survivors of the actual Pearl Harbour tragedy. But likewise as a fictional film goes this is a demeaning and shallow, utterly stupid film that should not have been made. Avoid it please at all costs."
1,"Man, what a waste!","When I heard that Randall Wallace had written it, I tought: ""Well, this is gonna be great"". I like war movies and I liked BRAVEHEART a lot. I had seriou suspicions because Ben Affleck was in it, but anyway I tought it would be a great movie.Man, IT IS NOT! The film is polished to the limit, the love triangle is annoying, really ANNOYING. The way they used the Doolittle raid was a joke in the story. This is a heartless, big-budget movie, like countless others. The only scene I liked was the air combat over the Dover cliffs, between RAF Spitifres and the German ME 109. Very well made."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!!,"This is what you get when your target audience is a big fan of ""Anne of Green Gables"". No intelligent man or woman should be forced to suffer through this horrible depiction of one the most epic events in world history. All of the action scenes would have been just at home in a PBS WWII episode. These three individuals were supposed to represent the american people?? pleeeeeeease!!!"
1,Terrible movie,"This has got to be the *worst* movie I have ever seen in my life. Terrible, insipid dialogue; ridiculous and unbelievable situations and scenes; and modified history. The war scenes are quite well done, but those just don't make up for the complete lack of a believable plot and the lack of chemistry amongst the lead actors. There were so many REAL stories that could have been told about the people who gave their lives at Pearl Harbor -- why was the decision made to fabricate a foolish love story that is completely unbelievable and predictable, and foist that on an unsuspecting public?"
3,ok,"but not better than black hawk down. definetly not as much action. this stars ben afleck , josh hartnett, kate beckinsale , alec baldwin, and william fichtner. its overlong. i want the directors cut though. 4 discs rated r for more action but 1 hourlonger. this movie has the subplot of titanic. sappy romance."
2,Dissapointing Blu Ray,"The two stars are for the Japanese approach into Pearl Harbor and the action torpedo sequence. The rest of the plot is worthless! On the Blu Ray version the images are not what I had expected, there is no DTS Sound, and what happened with all the extra features from the original dvd? Same dissapointing plots as Titanic, and Black Hawk Down. Hope the Patriot doesn't dissapoint me when I go see it in blu ray."
2,"It killed an evening that needed to die, anyway.",Thank God I borrowed this one from the library! Every time I saw a spinning propeller I thought of what my WWII veteran parents must be doing in their shared grave if they saw any of this crap through my eyes. I couldn't even enjoy the battle scenes because of the technical anomalies and anachronisms. It did keep me watching for the entire three hours just hoping it might get better and it finally did when it stopped.
3,nice but...,"Nice extra feautures. But the movie is on two discs. Annoying having to change discs midway through even though DVDs can hold 4 hours on a side when double layered.Titanic and Green Mile, which are about the same length as Pearl Habor, fit the movie on one disk.I'd expect this on VHS but not on DVD"
1,Worst Look at Pearl Harbor Attack...not worth a 2nd look,"This film is so inconsiquental to the actual events that happened leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, it is a disgrace to all WW2 veterans. Pearl Harbor was best, and miraciously, rendered in the film ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", that this story is just a farce of anything it tries to be.Apparently, the writers tried to make the film a step closer to ""Titanic"" in its love story (note...love story is all fiction, and some of the language in the film was never used 61 years ago).The special effects are spectacular, but the filmakers script is so belittled, it makes you wish to know what really happened, not just someone is trying to 'cash in ' on the 60th anniversary of this event.Go rent or buy ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" if you are really interested in the Pearl Harbor attack , and try to not make this farce of a story lend itself to the truth that happened."
1,An Insult to any Seaman of WWII,"Dear God! but I'm glad I'd not seen this abomination earlier and wish I'd never seen it at all. The title is ""Pearl Harbor""--which was a NAVY tragedy--but the plot focuses on the trifling issues of the (then) Army Air Force. Had they titled it ""Dolittle's Raid"", it might more accurately reflect the wretched production. My father, who was on the West Virginia that day (and was represented without name in the movie) must be spinning in his grave. History it is not, nor anything like unto. Entertaining--possibly to those of low or no standards of historical accuracy--but to pretend it reflects anything whatever about the tragedy at Pearl Harbor is a farce worthy only of Hollywood in its cups. Had I the money I would buy up every copy, including originals, and destroy them as a tribute to my father and his NAVY friends who died that day and were passed over by this movie that Sucketh Mightily."
4,Better than I expected,"I was genuinely suprised at how good Pearl Harbor was, based on the fact that most reviews were negative. I thought the acting was good, especially from Kate Beckensdale and Ben Affleck. How much research and money went into this movie is apparent as you see the magnifecent Pearl Harbor in 1942- and view it being destroyed. Yes, I know more time than was needed was spent on the love story/triangle thing, and that's why this didn't get 5 stars. Basically, I think this is as good as Hollywood gets- at least in direcion and special effects, anyway. The attack scene will blow you away."
1,I felt like walking out halfway through.,"Please stop Jerry Bruckheimer,haven't you done enough damage."
5,Who wouldn't?,"Great service, the product was in great shape.I really just like Ben Affleck's face... and lip syncing to Faith Hill's ""There You'll Be"". (The only good use for Faith Hill's music...)"
2,masterpiece of mayhem,"To me PEARL HARBOR is the best ""war"" movie that I ever saw. However, this movie is really a love story about two men in love with the same woman. The attack on Pearl Harbor is a mere backdrop for the basic plotline.Visually, this film is full of beautiful shots of planes ""soaring against the sky."" Though I was born four years after the Day of Infamy, the battle scenes in the movie seem realistic to me, perhaps even more so than the usual B&W; combat footage of the attack that we see on the History Channel.This movie makes an historical event come to life because we get to know the characters well enough to become attached to them as the plot unfolds.The director, Michael Bey, did his job well; so did the special effects people.The movie grabbed me and held me for over three hours."
5,A great war film!,"I don't know how so many people can put this film down. It is not ""Saving Private Ryan"". People time after time give new war films no credit because they are not as gritty as SPR. SPR was a new level of intensity in war films. It is however, unfair for people to expect every war film from now on to be as graphic. I can tell you now, no war film will ever be like SPR. It just won't happen. This film is good. It has elements of classic war films in it because it combines action/combat, and romance. I don't think it was meant to give all the historical details of the attack, like ""Tora Tora Tora"". It was about how the attack changed the lives of a small group of people on a personal level. It is about the people, similer in theory to ""The Deer Hunter"". This will someday be a true classic of the war film genre."
2,The bomb was on me!,The packaging was a bit worn and the movie skipped during key parts. I was not satisfied with the quality of the dvd....
3,Could've been better,"Launched to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the Japanese bombing of the American Navy, ""Pearl Harbor"" tries to capitalize on American sentiment by releasing a movie that has more to do with a typical Hollywood love story than a historical film. The visual effects and the recreation of December 7th save this movie from what is otherwise a long drawn out and highly cliched love story (did I mention improbable? -although I'm sure at some point during the war it happened...) Overall, I can't help but feel that Hollywood lunged to capitalize on an American tragedy by commercializing the deaths of Americans (the DVD was released on December 7, 2001) ...enough said."
1,I hate this movie!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!! ...Unrealistic battle scenes and a sappy love triangle. But if you want unrealistic war movies, buy ""Behind Enemy Lines"", and if you want realistic, buy ""Band of Brothers"". But not this one!"
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!,THIS FILM IS A DISGRACE TO ALL WHO WHERE THERE!!! THESE IDIOTS IN HOLLYWOOD DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT GETTING IT RIGHT!! THIS IS A FAILURE & A MOCKERY TO HISTORY!!! I HOPE THE IDIOTS WHO MADE THIS ACTUALLY READ THESE REVIEWS!!
1,Retake,"I viewed ""Pearl Harbor"" again to see if it is as bad as I remembered it.It's not as bad as I remembered it. IT'S WORSE!!"
2,A collosal failure of a flick,"Pearl Harbor...December 7th...a date which will live in infamy. This film took on a subject near and dear to the hearts of Americans everywhere, and failed to do it justice. Fantastic explosions and effects and a quality score from Hans Zimmer could not resurrect this movie from the stench of mediocrity.A tacked on love story was butchered further by the B-level acting ""talent"" of Ben Affleck, but one gets the sense that, even perfectly done, it would not have worked against the backdrop of the terrible attack. It would be like the soldiers on Normandy Beach stopping for a romantic tryst halfway up a sand dune.The movie also played out about an hour too long. The last hour (all AFTER the attack on us) just pushed my opinion of the movie lower and lower.All that said, I did mention that the movie had solid effects and a wonderful score. But poor acting and a bad script were just too much to overcome. Steer clear of this one!"
1,"very, very poor","A tragic US event in Hawaii made into an almost joke. The fight scene may have been good, but the stretching of the truth for dramatic effect was painful. ""I can't swim"" when said from any Navy soldier was beyond stupid and unrealistic when one of te ships were being sunk. Yes, pilots may have gotten in illegally, its possible. But in my mind it is a MAJOR screw up from the screenwriter and director Michael Bay for allowing such inaccurate battle scenes to be filmed. *SPOILER* You cant tell me you can shoot up a plane from a tower with a pistol and shot gun. maybe a heavy duty machine gun, but that is pushing it. the love story got over the top too.very poor overall."
1,Worst movie ever made? It's got to be close...,"It's a shame. Large, talented cast. Great locations. Lots of money spent... on everything but the script. I remember seeing previews and being really excited to see Pearl Harbor. Imagine my dissappointment when I saw the movie and learned that the movie was just BARELY about Pearl Harbor.Pearl Harbor isn't an appropriate title for this movie. A better title would be, ""Adolecent minded adults find themselves in a trailer park type love triangle - and WWII!""Additional appropriate tags for this movie: Crap, Springer, Film Makers You Wish Could Be Killed by Bees..."
2,Whats Love got to do with it?,"I like love stories, but this one made me sick!The love triangle took away from the real story."
5,PH review,"I bought it for my wife for Christmas, and watched for the first time, and it was very good, recommend it!"
2,could really have been much better.,"got to agree with some of the other reviews given in here, so i won't repeat them. but i will say they sould have paid more attention in other areas than ""eye candy."" they even screwed that up, because they used the wrong model japanese zeros in the film. they used A6M5's, a model that appeared in WWII near the end of 1943 - atleast 18 months later. they should have used A6M2 type 21's.some of the zeros were green, all zeros that attacked pearl that day were carrier based - i.e. should have been IJN light grey - green zeros were land based. i realize that the planes were computer generated, but if you are going through the trouble of rendering it in a computer, why can't they just do it right?oh. and they used the wrong model B-25's to bomb tokyo."
2,Titanic-Wannabee,"This movie was terrible. They tried to imitate Titanic, but there was some vital things missing:1) No chemistry between the actors. I honestly cannot believe that Affleck and Beckinsale are in love. Nowhere compares to Rose and Leo.2) Terrible acting3) Overdramatic- slow motion should be outlawed4) A SLLLOOW beginning5) Cannot relate to charactersThe ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars is for the special effects; they are actually quite good. But that's it. Don't waste your money."
5,My favorite Movie,"Pearl Harbor is an amazing movie, with all of the great graphics and a wonderful love story mixed in. I have never cried so hard when watching this movie! I would recommend this movie to people of all ages, because many people need to know how horrible this situation was. Before this movie, I barely gave a thought to this historical moment. Now, I want to watch this movie over and over again because it was so well put together and has such a great plot."
3,Historical problems,"The action part of the film is fine, the love triangle a little too much, and there are some historical inaccuracies. The best, and most factual, account is still Tora Tora Tora."
1,"Ok Movie, terrible DVD","The movie itself is alright, a little too manufactured and even quite ridiculous at some points (especially the ending). Though still entertaining.The main problem is that the movie is spaced into 2 discs, very reminiscent of a Laser Disc flipping sides. Everyone knows that DVDs can hold more than one movie easily, however the moron who edited this movie decided to place bonus materials on both discs, not leaving room for the entire movie on one, IDIOT!!!!Rent it, its not worth owning like this, might as well end the movie half way through."
4,Good Movie,The first time I saw this movie was at the theater and although I am not a person who likes many action movies I really liked this one. When it came out on video I had to watch it again.I found it to be a movie to make me laugh at times and also cry at times. It is a movie I will surely be watching again and again.
5,1 of the action pack worth to collect,"I like Michael Bay's films, all of them, and this is 1 of his film that i love all the time. When the director's cut of DVD came out, i bought it, and i am totally satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality. Now coming to blu's age, they came out with blu ray for this movie also, what you waiting for? get 1 of it and keep in your shelf as collection."
4,Great story and picture quality,"I've watched this movie a number of times via standard DVD format and now Blu Ray. This is a really nice movie to showcase your Blu Ray player and HD TV, I thought the picture and sound quality was astounding, and I'm fussy."
1,Can I give this movie zero stars?,"I am mystified by the Pearl Harbor reviews, specifically the good ones. In short, Pearl Harbor is a hell-stew of ear-shattering volume, wooden acting, laughable dialogue, unfunny humor attempts, and bad history. Believe all of the negative press and reviews of this movie, it is all true.In typical Michael Bay fashion, the horror of Pearl Harbor is reduced to a putrid love story and an excuse to make big explosions. History deserved better than this."
3,Not bad I guess,Its been a while since I viewed this film but I have to write something so I hope this qualifies.
4,Pearl Harbor,Pearl Harbor gave me the feeling of being there when is happend and gave detailed relationships interwoven into the story. PEARL HARBOR
3,Pearl Harbor,"Tooooooooooo Long, could have cut 45min to 1 hour off this movie would have made it better should have hired a better editor."
5,Pearl Harbor - DVD,Arrived in the condition I had hoped it would. Pearl Harbor is definitely one of my favorite movies. Very well made.
2,What Will Hollywood Trivialize Next?,"It's amazing how far Hollywood fatcats will go to make a huge buck. It's downright disrespectful to take anyone, especially a few KIDS who can't act to retell (in their own way) perhaps the biggest event in our nation's history (9/11 notwithstanding). Why take a historical event & throw in a love story? Who cares? Again, WHO CARES? Any one of our treasured WWII vets would surely puke at this terrible farce. To boot, the movie [is not very good], and the CGI gets old really fast. I know most want to see this picture, so be my guest. Be prepared for a massive letdown."
4,Pearl Harbor,"It's a great movie, lots of action, although it could have been about half-hour short. The attack scene is amazing, as well are the scenes of the battle of England, but the romantic stuff is just plain dumb! The end of the movie is ridiculous. But all in all, it's a very good title, and th action scenes make it far better than that other romantic-sacharine movie... what was the title? Oh yes, Titanic!"
2,"Good effects, very poor storyline","If you want to really learn about what hapened in Pearl Harbor, then get yourself a copy of ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" Otherwise, the only thing worth seeing in this movie is the segment dedicated to the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, for its realism and incredible effects. The acting was very poor, and the love story was for the most part pointless. Too bad that Cuba Gooding's role was so minor (a cook from the USS Arizona): he might have been able to save the movie, because Ben Affleck didn't."
5,"My review for ""Linux Mandrake OS 7.0 Complete""","I thought this book was well thought out. It has vivid pictures and screenshots of many of the Mandrake Linux gui's (Gnome, KDE, etc.). It helped me learn Linux quickly. When i started reading, i had barely an idea of what Linux was; but upon completion of this book, i have now become a (self proclaimed) guru. I would reccomend this book for the novice to intermediate Linux user."
5,Like French wine he just gets better with age,"Francis Cabrel starting recording in the 70's and since then has put out one great album after another every 5 years or so. Listen to them all and you can see his talent mature and his style expand and evolve. Les Beaux Dégats just might be his best effort - although admittedly that's a tough call coming on the heels of such hit albums as Hors Saison, Samedi Soir Sur La Terre, and Sarbacane. Beaux Dégats shows off Cabrel's versatility in everything from pop to jazz to blues, has great instrumentals and, as always, shows off his distinct Provence accent and style. Although my own favorites are Bonne Nouvelle and Tu Me Corresponds, there are no duds on here and the whole album grows on you as you replay it. Francis Cabrel is not just another guy churning out songs for a living - he's a unique artist in the same league of musical legends as James Taylor. Like a good wine he just keeps getting better."
3,General Photography Book,"This book is ok. I am a beginning photographer looking to get back in the swing of things. I t has been quite some time since I last photographed, but had a brief background. This book- is basically for someone that has no knowledge about photography at all. The book explains the basics of the history of photography and functions of the camera...all in all- the book is just ok. Very little talk about HOW to take black and white photos/ balance- moreless photos/ negatives/ and developing in general. Nothing about DSLR's.... JUST OK."
5,Funny,"I bought this album when it was brand new, before the cover was banned (like half of their covers were). This is Death Metal. I find reading the reviews below to be very funny. If you read the lyrics, you know that Cannibal Corpse do not take themselves seriously, at all. They're a bunch of guys having fun singing about sick stuff, and getting out a little agression. It's kind of fun to listen to a band sing something like ""Blood Splattered Road Sign"" instead of the usual Limp/Slipknot ""I'll kick you're butt if you look at me funny"" lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I like those bands, but CCorpse is something different.Read the One Star reviews below. I haven't seen this many people made so angry by and album since Atari Teenage Riot ""Burn Berlin Burn"", John Zorn, or Naked City. If you think you like Death Metal and heavy music...and you have a good sense of humor, get this CD. It's fun."
2,Butchered Indeed,"CC's second album helped to define their sound. This is the album where the ultra heavy tones, indiscernable grunting, and pure masochism truly comes out. Unfortunately, the results aren't that pleasant. The lyrics are grotesque, but not as amusing as the previous album and the vocals aren't any better. The guitarwork is heavy and the riffs are cool, especially on the breakdown parts of Meat Hook Sodomy and Gutted. The best parts of the album? The cover image is wicked cool and the album was banned in numerous countries, including Germany. Other than that, this is a poor example of talented death metal."
4,"Extreme music, only for the strong","... the music of Cannibal corpse is a lethal assault on all our false notions of mortality. They show us the physical side of death, the way it REALLY is, ie disgusting, unsettling etc. Not the mystical nonsense of religion. The music and lyrics are brutal because they need to be. They're attempting to smash through our denial, and the walls of ignorance we've constructed to protect us from thinking about stuff like this. This is dangerous, extreme, liberating music. Listen to it, and become strong."
3,its ok,"this is an ok album for cannibal corpse, very heavy and extreme as expected. but the songs arent really catchy. a good cc cd is tomb of the mutilated, my other is gore obsessed which is halfway decent."
1,A Blind Devotion Buy,"Butchered at Birth is the sixth Cannibal Corpse cd I have bought in the last month, but this is the worst. It starts with a two minuite boring intro then breaks into the worst sounding CC album put to disk. The guitars sound like pawn shop specials, run through a five dollar stomp box. . I have gotten better recordings on my four track. The riffs and songs are generic and sound like a garage band doing an immitation of CC. There are very few lead breaks or memorable riffs. Overall, a very generic death album, only for the die hard CC fans. If you want to hear good Cannibal Corpse, start with The Bleeding, or Bloodthirsty."
1,"0 stars, but I'm not allowed to put in 0 stars...","How can you people listen to this crap? I just listened to the samples, and it sounds like the same song... a boring and highly monotonous song I might add... my god, this ""music"" is crap..."
1,TRASH plain and simple...these are suppose to be talented?,You kidding me?...ppl keep giving bad reviews to ppl like ashle simpson and the like and suggest that ppl lsiten to talented muscians like these guys...they have less talent that ashlee and the others they trash all day long....anyone can make this music...grunt and howl like a demon and pull the strings on your gutiar..and you have done it...wow what talent...
1,Why Can't I Rate It With No Stars?,"The cover to Butchered At Birth is the worst I've seen! C'mon people! Cannibal Corpse doesn't have any talent at all! I would give this album no stars, but that wasn't an option. Death metal couldn't get any worse than this. End."
2,Stale,"For death metal, this sounds like garbage. The drums are poorly miked, the guitars sound condensed and Chris Barnes, like always, cannot sing. There are a few decent riffs on this album, but overall it's a disappointment considering all of the praise it gets. Get Vile instead"
2,Decent,"It seems to me that Cannibal Corpse gets alot of publicity merely because of their sick, perverted, vile and disgusting subject matter. Butchered At Birth is really just another Cannibal Corpse album. Heavy, fast, aggressive, intense, and shocking lyrics.Its not an album that breaks new ground, and it won't convert anybody to metal. The fact is, if you're looking for good death metal, look elsewhere. Go buy Slayer's ""Reign In Blood"" or ""Show No Mercy"". They are ten times better than any of Cannibal Corpse's albums. The only people i can recommend this album to are Cannibal Corpse fans, extreme metal fans, those who already have all of Slayer's and Nevermore's releases, or those who are just sick and disgusting people like Cannibal Corpse."
2,Good god!,"This is sooo funny. I was browsing around and decided to listen to this CD. It took me a few minutes to stop laughing at it. The music was not too bad, but the vocals, oh god the vocals...This guy sounds like a pit bull that swallowed a rusty chainsaw and now he's singing with it. I couldn't understand a single word. Most people say that about most metal, but this is the epitimy of that statement. Take a listen to the samples for a good chuckle."
1,BUTCHERED AT THE START,"This CD was butchered at the start, due to the previous records made by this so-called ""band"". I listened to it hoping that the lyrics would stop being so demented and we could hear the singer singing anything, bu thtat didn't happen."
1,"Good Lord, What Is This Crap!?!","Man, what junk. The music is actually hard to listen to. Whatever happened to melody. Or rythm, or talent.Now, most of you say, ""This is Hardcore Death Metal!!! Woot!!"", I don't give one rat's ... what type of music it is, it's just poor.If I could play an intramet I'd be in a band, and not writing this review. But I know a band that knows only 3 chords and plays those sloppy when I hear one. And this is just junk...., the whole ""look at the depressing world as it is"" theme is so overused and just plain old childish. If you want to be in a band, have something worth while to say, or say nothing at all.Anyone who thinks this is neat, get a bloody life."
5,Trying To Even Things Out,"I'd recommend the remaster of Eaten Back To Life over this cd, but I'd still give this cd about 4 stars. It gets a bit repetitive here and there, but it's a very good cd overall. The remastering helped considerably. The bass is still buried under everything else (which is unfortunate, because Alex is the best thing this band ever had), but the guitar sound is much improved. I'm giving it 5 stars to help even it out a bit, thanks to a couple of ignorant twits that didn't justify their poor reviews. I'd recommend the remaster of Eaten Back To Life over this cd."
4,It's Cannibal Corpse,"You either like it or you don't. One listen is enough. If you've heard other Cannibal Corpse albums and like them, you'll like this one too. If you don't like Cannibal Corpse nothing I can say will change your mind. Consider yourself warned."
4,Great vocals,"Well, this one is very different from Eaten Back to life. The vocals are great, really deep vocals. Cannibal Corpse start to go really deep into gore, I mean , the first album was very violent but had some different stuff, but this one is pure brutality, just take a look and you'll see. The music is great. But the vocal are really the difference. It's not better then Eaten , but certainly it worths buying if you like this stuff, like me, but first timers probably wont like it"
5,Their best!,"This is Cannibal Corpse's best CD all the way! This album was a giant step up from ""Eaten Back to Life"". All of their new material is nothing compared to what this album was. Best songs on this album are Gutted, Covered with Sores, Vomit the Soul, & Innards Decay. All you people that say Cannibal Corpse sucks or that they ca'nt play have no idea what the hell real music is. Highly recommended for any true death metaller."
4,Butchered At Birth,"This is probably Corpse's most grinding, brutal cd. It's a classic Corpse album all the way. The cover art is just excellent, and the lyrics are also great in that Cannibal Corpse way. If you havent bought any Cannibal Corpse cd yet, go with this one. Corpse's newest cd is terrible, so go with this and their older stuff."
1,Totally horrorfic!,"This cd and this band are the answer to the Columbine shootings. Shocking, scandalous, sick, repulsive, untalented! And most of all TOTALLY EVIL BEYOND RECONGNITION! If you're smart, than stay away from Cannibal Corpse. The cover art to ""Butchered"" is undoubtably the worst ever! I would give zero stars, but that wasn't a choice."
1,"Actually, I give it 0 stars","This and all other Cannibal Corpse albums are ridiculous. Don't waste your precious money. This is laughable. The only thing you hear is grunting... Very funny, though... Do yourself a favor and go to Black Metal: Cradle of Filth and Emperor"
1,They tried to make a good death-metal album...,"Cannibal Corpse repeats in this CD their sick formula of demented and disgusting lyrics (nobody knows why), without adding nothing to death metal, unlike Slayer, which still are great, Exodus and others. It doesn't worth the price."
3,"An ""OK"" effort","Don't get me wrong, some of the songs on this album are beautifully arranged and written. They are inspiring and thoughtful, but this album is inconsistent. I would buy it again because I truly love the songs I like, but the rest are just OK. This seems to be a common theme with Mercy Me's album consistency. They are great at writing 3-6 hits an album and the rest are just ok."
2,You might be a little disappointed,"I agree with what earlier reviewer ""linnar13"" commented. I also love MercyMe's first two albums, esp. the 2nd one ""Spoken For"". And I pre-ordered this one, ""Undone"", even before the 30-second sound tracks were available, and got it right after it was released. I wasn't very impressed by any of those songs. But I think, though this time God doesn't speak to me through this album, songs in it can still bring blessings to other brothers and sisters who like this type of melody/lyrics. So, I praise God for that. In this way, I am not very disappointed, because I still have other 100+/- CDs to enjoy. Just one suggestion, before you make your purchase decision, be sure to listen to those sound tracks to make sure you like it. God bless!"
3,1st and 2nd album are better.,(3.4/5.0)1. Where You Lead Me - 7/102. Everything Impossible - 8/103. Here With Me - 7/104. In the Blink of an Eye - 7/105. Unaware - 6/106. Homesick - 7/107. When You Spoke My Name - 7/108. A Million Miles Away - 7/109. Caught Up in the Middle - 7.5/1010. Never Alone - 7.5/1011. Undone - 6/1012. Shine On - 6/1013. Keep Singing - 5/10
2,not what i expected!,"this c.d. does'nt have the passion as the other c.d.s!I was at a brean chritian center and saw a sign that said:coming soon from mercy me!Undone.I couldn't wait to purchase this so i did. I bought it for the songs here with me and homesick.Those are the only songs i like on this album.This is nowhere near as good as almost there and i haven't purchased spoken for so i don't know about that one.You might want to buy their other c.d.s then buy this.Well,talk to ya next review!"
1,Just did not come close enough,"I've heard other MercyMe stuff, so when I borrowed this CD from a friend, I was hoping to hear the same type of thing. I was so disppointed! It simply does not measure up to I Can Only Imagine and some of their other songs. I was not impressed with this CD at all."
5,Adorable! My 4 year old loves th breezies!,This it s very cute and well made toy. My 4 year old daughter is in love with My Little Pony and went just nuts over this collection of 3 breezies in the 3 cart train that rolls across the floor. The breezies are removable.
1,Cute - but Fell Apart!,"I must say that this book is adorable and my daughter loved it. The problem is that it completely FELL APART about two days after we got it. The binding is not nearly strong enough to hold the thick wooden ""pages"" together. There is no way to repair it once it falls apart. I had to throw the book away. I would not recommend this book for anyone who actually wants their child to open it and read the story."
3,so so..,"This is a so so anime softcore ""porn""... it's nothing compared to la blue girl, but if you like naked anime girls, you'll like this."
2,Repetitive and common sense,"A friend of mine bought me this book, knowing, that as a nurse, I am a nursing book junkie. I found this book elementary and repetitive. Many of the tips and suggestions were common sense. I was disappointed by this one."
1,Not What You Think,"I was very disapointed in this book. I bought this book for my Daughter who is a working mom to a four-year-old. I thought it would provide coping strategies for her. Not so. All but one of its chapters deals with women who are pregnant and not yet mothers. This is hardly what one would think from the title, if my definition of ""mother"" is correct. All the situations in the book were to inform expectant mothers of things to expect. I will be returning this book as unsuitable for intended purpose."
4,The torch is passed,"Chris Trashcan and company dance in the angry, dirty shoes of Mudhoney and The Mono Men."
3,Reflections,"Esping-Andersen is quite pedantic and to my taste a little bit 'all over the place' in the sense that the writing style keeps offering 'most important 3 things' on almost every page. At least, the book reflects on Soskice, author that I like. I have read the book as part of the mandatory literature for PhD and it was OK."
4,Good Sound,Despite the very low prices there is nothing wrong with the sound quality. You might not agree with everything the band does but it's typical Ellingtonia except for the My Funny Valentine feature for clarinet and muted trombone which is beneficially atypical. It's presented in 2 not quite complete sets culminating in a 5 min. Gonsalves solo on Diminuendo and Crescendo In Blue.
2,Is it just my disc? Sound quality is poor.,"Of all the Icon series discs, the Duke's disc audio was not a pleasure to hear."
5,Fabulous,I love Will & Grace Season 1! I got hooked on it on TV but I could never find when it came on. I'm halfway through the entire collection and I'm LOVING IT! Season 1 was an excellent start that really set a foundation for the rest of the show.
4,Where are the bloopers?,"This has some hilarious moments. I love the show and never miss an episode, but I was hoping for bloopers. The extras are nothing more than snippets taken from the season strung together. Creative, but I would much rather see the outtakes."
3,Ok start to a great show,"I mostly got to see episodes from the later seasons, so this was a little bit of a let down. Ok for getting a character history and getting a feel for the foundation of the show. The humor, talent, and appeal of the show as a whole is less intense in Season One. It's the start, so you pretty much have to have it if you are going to get the rest..."
3,the deal,"first disc wont play through on my computer so I have to use a seperate dvd player and it works fine. Kind of upset me though, then I saw a smudge on the disc and haven't tried it since I cleaned it. Good series though hopefully I will enjoy and bring me back to that old will and grace feel."
2,"1 disc didn't work, no response from email to seller",Received the DVD set on time. One of the discs didn't work. I emailed the user and the user never replied.
4,Enjoyable,The quality of the set was good. It was shipped and received within only a couple of days. Very enjoyable to revisit the first season of this fun television series!
2,Amazon sent me a tampered box set.,"When I got the DVD set for christmas I realized the plastic was split on one side and carefully taped closed. When I opened it I found two DVDs missing. Never got the replacment in time for christmas, you would think these things recieved a basic inspection before shipment."
3,"Great show, but disapointing DVD","I am a huge fan of W&G, but I was very disapointed in the lack of extras that really should have been added to the DVD. There was an absurdly short interview with the cast and nothing that any second rate fan would already know was revealed. I expected much more from this DVD and I wish I had skipped on ordering it. With the show in syndication it's not tough to see all the first season episodes on tv, this is why I expected a lot of added extras; without the extras the DVD is a waste of money in my opinion."
5,Will & Grace Fan!!!!!,"I love this show. I, however, was not into it the first season it began. Now I am an addict. I enjoyed viewing the pilot episode as well as the commentary by the creators. It was an experience to see the characters form their personalities (as well as voices). I really enjoy watching this DVD set and would definitely recommend it to any of the show's fans. I am excited for Season 2, March 23, 2004."
3,Doesn't do the show justice,"Will & Grace: Season 1 on DVD is a good product simply because it contains 22 episodes of one of the funniest sitcoms that TV has ever seen. Sadly, thats just about where the good ends. Actually, thats almost where the DVD ends.Will & Grace has a group of co-stars that could not be any better. The chemistry between Will & Grace and Jack & Karen is off the charts. And Jack is, well, Just Jack, to quote his one-man show. This character is hilarious. It will be sad if this character doesn't resurface after this show's run.Despite decent at best interviews and well-done (and well-suited for the show) themed featurettes, this CD-set is missing some extras! Come on now, where are the bloopers????All-in-all, a good re-introduction to a show that is definately a keeper, but not exactly ""loaded with extra features"", as the case would like to tell you."
1,Astonishingly Overrated and Desperately Unfunny,"I've seen about three episodes of WILL & GRACE and I just don't get it. The weakest SEINFELD is still better than what I've seen. Debra Messing comes off as mental and her desperate need to be friends with Eric McCormack is just weird. I wonder what gays would do if SNL or any other comedy show resorted to the stereotypes seen here.I've also noticed that the studio audience--whoever they are--completely over-do their laughter at times, as if they were making a political statement instead of enjoying a good laugh. The laughter comes across as forced and even desperate.Does anyone else notice that?"
1,How'd this get so popular?,"Loud, unfunny, the lines shouted sitcom style. I really tried to like this, watched 2-3 episodes and gave up. Where's the beef?"
2,Disappointing,"I love Marvin Sewell, I think he is a brilliant guitarist, but I was struggling to enjoy this material, which I found dreary and uninspiring. Artists must have room to express what they feel, so i wont complain too much and I dont mind buying the record. But I hope he does more of the stuff that really gets folks alive and grooving."
3,cool rust,"loved the mugs when they came and now they go . wanna know why ? after time , granted cleaned in the washing machine , they get spots that look like rust that do not wipe off so easy. so i assume they are rust . which leads me to believe these are not a high quality stainless material . again . love the mugs otherwise but am going to look for alternatives which may be safer to drink out of ."
3,Pretty Decent but not Excellent,"Alright, first - this mug leaves a bit of a metallic taste at first. After a few washings though that pretty much goes away. But if you let a drink sit in it for several hours - like over night - it will have a tiny little metallic taste in the morning.It does keep drinks warm or cold for a fairly good amount of time. I think the Starbucks stainless steel mugs have everybody beat on that though. It's about half as good as my Starbuck mugs and about twice as good as a regular, non-stainless steel cup or glass.I do like the way it looks though. And I'm happy to use it, but I have two conditions for using it. One, I won't use it if I'm going to let a drink sit in it for several hours. And two, I won't use it if I want something to stay really hot or cold for more than about a half hour.In the end it's acceptable and it is pretty cool to look at. So I do enjoy using it - when my two special conditions permit! Which is about 60% of the time!"
5,Perfect Father's Day present,"I bought this for my dad for Father's Day, and he loved it. Perfect size for a can of Michelob Ultra, and he says it keeps the beer much, much colder than the can, especially if you put it in the freezer before using it. Wonderful product, excellent seller service."
3,Seen better,"I ordered these thinking they'd be the same as a matching pair I received as a gift a few years ago. Same design but the workmanship wasn't as good. Also, a lower quality of stainless steel was used. The bottom of the cup indicates 18/8 stainless steel. The ones I got a few years ago are labeled as having 18/10 stainless steel. Still, I'm not unhappy with these. For the price, they're perfectly functional as long as you don't mind a mug that may not have the premium look you're hoping for."
2,not so hot,"I wanted this mug for hot tea and coffee. I am not satisfied with how it doesn't keep my beverages warm for long. They don't seem to stay warm much longer than my standard ceramic mug. I have a OXO stainless travel mug that does very well. I thought this would be similiar, but nope. Not worth the cost imo."
1,Poor quality control,"It would have been a fine mug if the handle was properly welded to the cup. I got sent a mug with a poor weld. The solder was slightly green, and there was a thick hairline crack visible where the weld should have been. The bad weld was on the top joint of the handle. The bottom weld was done right."
1,Amazon should pull this item,I bought one and had to return because the craftsmanship is horrible. It is a piece of junk that costs you $20. The SS surface is full of bubbles and the handle was not welded properly. Do not buy!
3,"Decent Cup, Bad weld","It keeps beverages cool and works well as a whole but, the weld that attaches the handle to the cup is pretty sketchy. Haven't had any problems yet but it's only a matter of time."
5,The Wait Was Worthwhile,"Some years ago I read Corti's work from the 1750's through to the 1830's. I was hooked. Sadly, Cowle, Roth and Morton were disappointing. Niall's work has been a long time coming but the wait has been very worthwhile. A word of warning - I was fortunate to spot and purchase the entire book, right up to present times. Read the small print in 'Money's Prophets' and you will see that it is the first of two volumes. What the heck? For those who have to, the wait for volume II will again be worth it!"
2,Niall Carries Rothschild's Water,kind of dry-Niall is an apologist for the Rothschilds who pull the strings in the world of finance and all of the carnage that they have wrought
4,Cathe Power Hour,"I really love this DVD. It is hard work, and is a perfect substitute for the Pump classes I used to attend at the gym, which unfortunately has now shut down. The only downside is the lack of good music."
4,B-movie Splendor,"I would have to say this was a brilliant movie. I was highly entertained from this Mr.Corman and Hill flick. Beautiful women getting roughed up, from the somewhat feminine guards. Pam Grier gets your full attention."
1,"The Big Bird Cage-5 stars for Pam,1 for content and 0 for the Revolution.","I've always disliked Corman for his views,as well as Haig and now add Hill.However,This movie has Pam Grier in it making it for me worth watching,Although I prefer Women in Cages(minus the sadism.),this one while shouting out viva la Revolucion which makes my blood boil(I hate revolutions.)actually makes fun of Revolutions in Sid Haig's Character and the plot(and he plays/mimicks the guard's sexuality.)but I can't stand GuerillaChic,despite it's funny moments,the movie is too drawn out and boring and the women with the exception of The ""Local"" women and Pam are ugly,that tall blonde looks like a Man and that curly haired one looks butchy as well sadly.Netflix showed it and I watched it,but It's one of the worst of the genre I have seen.At least the Revolution never came and it never will.(ThankGod.)"
2,Poor Pam Grier,"Basically unprofessional in every way - broad as a barn comedy, barely convincing acting and a 'script' that's an afterthought - but it is a 'Women In Prison' flick so what the heck... I give it a couple a stars. If you're new to this genre try some of the other WiP classics first though - Caged Heat for instance."
4,Solid Grier Action Movie,"This movie is much better than I anticipated. Despite being a ""women in prison"" exploitation movie, this film has more to offer than just cheap voyeurism. The plot surrounds life inside a womens prison in the Philippines and culminates in a break out. Complexity is added by the role of Pam Grier and her revolutionary friends who are hoping to assist the break out for their own aims. Grier is good as ever and well supported here by an unusual cast that work well. The whole movie is somewhat tongue in cheek, but still works as an action movie. There are few dull moments as the movie has plenty of action maintaining a good tempo and you come away feeling satisfied. The quality of the DVD version I have seen is quite high and it looks fresh and good to look at. Whilst you cannot take it too seriously, this would be quite worthwhile owning."
2,"nice idea, but. . . .",A good solid keyboard and the lighting is adiquate but the letters are white and therefore STILL cant be seen very well. The supports for the keys are black and are easily seen for all the good that does!!
5,BRAZILIAN TROPICAL ORCH.- THE BEST OF A.C. JOBIM,"The music of Antonio Carlos Jobim reaches a new dimension in feeling when interpreted by the ""BRAZILIAN TROPICAL ORCHESTRA"". This marvelous strings and brass orchestra with a brazilian typical chorus will re-explore the bossa-nova and romantic samba for you creating a real ""saudade"" mood while you listen. If you close your eyes listening to this CD you will find yourself walking on the sands of Copacabana Beach in Rio or perhaps the seashore in Bahia. What an album! What an orchestra! If you like Jobim and Brazilian music, do not miss this one!"
1,The Best of Antonio Carlos Jobim,This is not Antonio Calos Jobim. It's music he composed. It's elevator music.
2,Reverse Discrimination?,"Mr. Rein exhibits too much anger against women to make this book useful. His conclusions lack a sound scientific basis. He mentions, but does not explore other reasons for the dysfunction of children of divorce. Could it possibly have something to do with the recent study on daycare which found an increased incidence of violence in children who spend more than 30 hours a week in daycare? Instead of addressing these equally important facts, Mr. Rein seems intent on blasting all mothers involved in divorce. For this reason, I did not find the book credible, but gave it two stars since Mr. Rein has done a lot of one sided homework."
3,Cute but not Accurate,"This seemed like a good idea but it's very strange. Throughout the curtain there is no consistency as to whether the definite or indefinite article is used and they only sometimes indicate masculine/feminine versions of words. Many of the words are inaccurate or just plain wrong, but I still use it because it's better than nothing."
3,"Great Potential, Average Execution","The idea behind this film is great - an inside look at the street chess scene in San Francisco. Unfortunately, with a run time of only twenty-nine minutes, the film only scratches the surface of interesting topics. More attention should have been paid to the actual players and their experiences. For example, one player claims to have beaten a GM at his table. Was that the first GM he had played? What opening did he use? How often do GMs come to play? These questions are left unanswered, as are many others. Overall, the film lacks depth."
4,A great fun chess book.,"In this book Basman shows that the Grob opening is actually a dangerous weapon in the hands of an experienced practitioner. He proceeds to show his many victims (some of whom are very well known) as they struggled vainly against the Grob. There is a section of games for you to try and discover your own Grob potential, with the use of the ""Grobometer"". This book is surprisingly addictive and will provide many hours of amusement and even more hours of serious fun if you decide that the Killer Grob is opening for you!"
5,Crazy Pawn,"by Danny WoodallThe Killer Grob is great book to help you to play this tricky opening, for black or white."
4,Unorthodox but surprisingly strong opening,"This opening works as well for black as it does for white. Pushing the king-knight's pawn two spaces on the first move seems ridiculous at first sight but Basman shows that this may be the best way to ultimately control the center. There is an intersting ""test-yourself"" section at the back of the book with examples from master play where the reader picks from choices at each move and then receives a rating."
5,Great Atlas,"A very colorful well drawn anatomy atlas. There are some aspects of this book that I liked better than Netters, however, Netters seems to be the gold standard for anatomy atlases for medical students, so I would probably recommend buying it first. Good resource for learning anatomy for any medical student. Also, has decent radiological images at the end of each chapter along with related cross-sectional anatomy and related CT images."
4,awesome atlas,"awesome atlas. great ""teaching atlas"" with explanations to go along with the pictures. a great way to go through each system, as if a teacher were guiding you through each structure/organ. also, incudes a CD-ROM that can be installed on your computer, so you can review the atlas contents and it also includes a ""quizzing"" feature with labels removed."
3,All the information you need,"Lots and lots of illustrations, so it has all the stuff you need. Not easily accessible/not easy to navigate."
5,Poetic Fiction at its Finest,"McNamee's Resurrection Man is a dark, poetic novel, the prose of which conveys emotions, and mental images of the people, places and deeds it describes, with a clarity unlike any other novel I have read. I found myself often rereading passages two and three times to fully immerse myself in their precise and poetic imagery. While I have never been to Belfast, and do not have intimate knowledge of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, this book gave me a vivid sense of both, while capturing my attention and anticipation until the very last page. It is an important novel by an author who demonstrates a command of a unique and penetrating style of writing; a style I shall not soon forget. Well worth the read!"
3,I was *not* Carlos Castanda,"While this book has some interesting stories and biographical meanderings it has absolutely nothing to do with Don Carlos. Instead it uses his character as a timing device to move from one point to another in Goodman's series of short mystical bio pieces.These pieces are not bad, and this is a pretty enjoyable read. What this book is not - at all - is Toltec material. It only touches on shamanisim in the most superficial way (Goodman has a bad experience in the jungle as part of a New Age let's-take-a-new-drug ""medicine tour."") Goodman is convinced of the existance of worlds beyond our visible world - and this book explains why. This is a valuable beginner's message to bring to the populace, and I like that.If you are just starting out on your exploration of alternate ways of percieving the world you will probably enjoy this book for what it is, and not care about what it is not (Castanada).I was a little irked at being roped in with Castanada's name."
5,If you like Paul Coelho ...,"I suppose it's fair to compare this to Carlos Castaneda's own books. The writer Francis Huxley does that in his blurb in the book, saying the old (OK back from the dead) guy is in better form than ever.I found this a thrilling read. It's masterful the way so much is managed so simply. I loved the journey into the Amazon and really woke to the writer's take on shamanism. I can see how some people might be against this book, especially as the writer nearly died in the middle of a shamanic war. People will do anything to defend their own patch.If you like other spiritual adventure books (I'd compare this one to Paul Coelho's books for example, though I have enjoyed Castaneda's too) I'd say give this one a good try. It's changed my take on life and death a bit, made me feel a bit braver. Not bad in these troubled times."
4,A TANTALIZING READ FOR CASTANEDA ENTHUSIASTS,"Goodman is eloquent and insightful. He takes us on a fascinating trip with a resurrected Castaneda. More questions are raised than answered but it is a delightful read for Castaneda fans. For those interested in pursuing a shamanic path, I recommend 'The Path' (Esmeralda Arana) and 'Shaman, Healer, Sage (Alberto Villoldo)."
1,If you have internalized anything about shamanism vis-a-vis.,"...Castenada or his cohorts (Taisha Abelar, Florinda Donner-Grau), you will realize from reading the sample pages alone that the book has nothing to do with its tenets. The fact that Martin Goodman did not even research the body of literature upon which his fictional character is supposedly based speaks to how little he cares about even appearing to be truthful. ""Laughing all the way to the bank"" is the phrase that comes to mind."
1,Fraud exploits fraud. Amusing.,I picked the original Carlos Castaneda as a total fraud when his first book came out.I would put this book in the same class as the biography of Lobsang Rampa - the one written by his cat!
1,I was Martin Goodman,"This book is clearly a misrepresentation of Carlos Castaneda. None of the opinions or statements made by Goodman's invented character, Carlos Castaneda, are consistent with the real person. I had met Castaneda several times, and the self indulgent character painted by the self indulgent, Goodman, has no likeness to the Carlos Castaneda it is suppose to represent. If you like new age, fictional fluff this book is for you."
1,Fool Me Once,"This book is a feeble and amateurish effort that has usurped the name of Castaneda apparently as a marketing ploy. While the content is vaguely New Age, it bears little relation to the works of Carlos Castaneda. Someone, somewhere, seems to be operating on the premise that slapping the name Castaneda on a book cover will automatically sell ""X"" number of books, regardless of content or quality. It worked with me this time, but I won't get fooled again."
1,A (...),"On the advice of a friend, I bought this book sight unseen. After a few pages it became clear to me that this book was an absolute and total (sham) -- a vain attempt to capitalize on the reputation and work of Carlos Castaneda. This book has absolutely nothing to do with the research done by Carlos Castaneda on the shamans of ancient Mexico.Buyer beware!"
2,sketchy...very sketchy,"From the standpoint of marketing genius in the title and cover design (overall concepting the book) this work is admirable.From the standpoint of revelling in the glory of an icon's memory to propel a mediocre writer's career, the work is disappointing.I'm of the opinion that negative reviews should only be reserved for the most extreme cases, works like this - that leave such a bad taste in the mouth.If I had written a book entitled, "" I was Timothy Leary: The Afterlife Dialogues by Brian Wallace, Timothy Leary "" I'd have trouble sleeping at night.Castaneda had many personalities, and I'm convinced that Martin Goodman's was not one of the them.Sorry.Brian Wallace/author/Labyrinth of Chaos"
1,This is sham not shaman,"Anyone familiar with the literary qualities of Carlos Castaneda's works will see immediately that this book's author could not possibly be quoting or paraphrasing Castaneda. Anyone familiar with the philosophic qualities of those works will see that this book's author could not possibly have met with, and understood, Castaneda--before or after Castaneda's death. Whether you are looking for insight or literature, you will not find it here. This book is all sham. There is nothing of a shaman in it."
1,Carlos Castaneda doesn't live here anymore,"If you are looking for Carlos, don't look here. Carlos Castaneda does not lead the author on a mystical journey, he doesn't lead him anywhere. He is not alive, has never been alive. The Carlos in this book is merely a literary device used to get the author from one mediocre story to the next. This is a cheap way to sell books.The stories are only mildly interesting and Goodman draws hackneyed, tired, Christian conclusions from them. Goodman admits he didn't get to interview Carlos and has limited experience with Castaneda's works. This work would have, at least, sounded more authentic if he had read or met the man. When I finished reading it, I felt cheated."
3,Good Portrayal of Programmatic Music!,"This is fabulous to present Chopin's Music. Instead of just listening, there is nature scenes to go along with the pieces! (Would be better if it was in a DVD format, though)"
3,How does this cost 6 cents?,"OK, this is not mind altering. But, it's really GOOD. Seriously, it's nothing that you're going to go and masturbate over, but it's totally listenable. I don't know what happened to these guys, except that one of them joined Ministry, but this is pretty good. Very dirty sounding, dark and sleazy. It doesn't hit the stride of say, Ministry or Godflesh, but it's a solid industrial metal album. The guy's voice sounds really good. Hahaha, it costs six cents! I lose that in a couch on a daily basis! Not great, but still better than almost everything on the radio. I say, if you can get it for less than ten bucks, go for it."
4,very enjoyable,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I like this movie, it's a great rainy day or late night flick. The scenery is beautiful and the horses are magnificent!"
3,"Good, not great ""sequel""......","""The Bride"" represents a noble effort to reinvent the Frankenstein film, but it falls a little short, mainly due to mediocre performances by Sting and Jennifer Beals. Contrary to popular belief, ""The Bride"" is NOT a remake of the classic ""Bride of Frankenstein"". It is, in effect, a sequel. The opening scene of ""The Bride"" is a re-imagining of the final scene of ""Bride of Frankenstein"". However, the Creature (named Victor here), his bride and the good Dr. Frankenstein all survive the laboratory's explosion. The rest of the film, which is a drama not a horror movie, follows the parallel story of the Creature and his would-be bride, discovering themselves and eventually, just maybe, each other. You'll need to see the movie to find out if the two ultimately get together, or not. Worth a look for the open minded."
4,I'm a softy for the 80's cinema....,"I will admit after watching the 1930's version of Metropolis, it held more intelligence and a theme, which is stilled used in films today, than ""The Bride"" could ever claim! But, there is much to be loved in this film. I've always enjoyed STING, with or without The Police, and had grown to enjoy his performance in ""DUNE"". Jennifer Beals (Flashdance)is as beautiful, sweet,innocent, and dangerous as she could portray. Clancy Brown (Highlander) played Frankenstein, an experiment longing for friendship and normality in his life. And you have to have heart for the ""little guy"" in the movie! The movie has it all adventure, love, action, and some dead spots! This film is for sentimental value only. If you've a soft spot in your heart for the 80's, it wouldn't hurt to buy this film. Be forewarned: You may only watch it once, but I felt it was worth beefing up my collection of films! VIVA STING! VIVA Jennifer Beals! VIVA Clancy Brown!And VIVA that little guy!!"
2,ONE THUMB UP ONE THUMB DOWN!,"This is a strange movie that is really like watching two different movies going on at the same time. The lively scenes with the Monster and his new found little friend are very engaging but, the scenes with Sting and his ready made bride will bore you to tears! It's a shame as this could have been much better, if the script would have had more to offer in the talky scenes. One of the better depictions of The Frankenstein Monster since the original series though."
3,"Kitch at it's best, but boring in parts","I have always ADORED Sting, so I saw this when I was a little girl and Police fan and LOVED it. However, I recently saw it again and noticed that it didn't hold up too well. A little slow in parts. I still adore Sting, so it is worth watching just to see him have a great time swishing around in an 80's goth redux of ""The Bride of Frankenstein."" If you liked him pissed of and yelly in the Hi-tech diaper in ""DUNE,"" you'll like him here too."
2,hmmmmmmmmm,"Best as i remember; back in the day, SNL has a segment called ""bad theater"", in which Leonard Pinth Garnell (ala Alastair Cook)would present a short production- and then reassure the audience, ""Now, that wasn't too good, WAS it?""One such production was a musical based on the life of 17th century Dutch Scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.After watching part of ""The Bride"", I think I can revisit the Leeuwenhoek show with a more generous attitude....."
4,A Great Overlooked Film,"I was 8 when I saw this for the first time. Of course being a kid some parts frightened me but I also laughed at certain parts when Viktor and Rinaldo were unknowingly getting into trouble. Since I was a kid I didn't pay much attention to the story, just the adventure. As I grew older I became more attached to the characters and their situations. To this day Rinaldo's death is the most heartbreaking and dramatic scene I've ever seen on film. You can't help but to think about someone close in your own life that you've lost when seeing this part. Oscar nods should have been made to David Rappaport and Clancy Brown based on this scene alone. In the end, Viktor does become ""human"" and redeems himself and his bride. The final battle between Vikor and Dr. Frankenstein then the fairy tale ending make this a film with a healthy dose of action, adventure, sadness and romance. A great film film overall."
1,Waste of Time/ Money,"I read the sample for this book and it seemed like a great book, then i bought it. Big mistake. THe book never stops making unnecessary biblical references every other word. I couldn't read the whole thing because as good as the points were, the unnecessary christian vibe was turning me away"
2,just soso,They are as thin as gauze and spit-up runs right though them. The edges are finished with some kind of cheap polyester felt that lacks any absorbency and frays easily. The Gerber cloths shrank so much that I can't possibly use them as diapers even if I tried.
1,Not worth it.,"I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn. Unfortunately, I haven't even given birth yet and I already know they're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros: inexpensive.The cons: These diapers are horribly rough, even after a washing. The fabric is fraying and even triple folded, these things do not hold liquid. Since I'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels, but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you're trying to dry, they don't absorb.Save your money and skip these...and buy a higher quality cloth diaper."
1,Not a true Birdseye,this looks like a gauze or cheesecloth! you can see thru it. these are not made with birdseye - check out my photo to see the difference.
2,Good for everything but diapers,"I have 2 dozen of these that I was going to use as ""back up"" diapers for my cloth stash. After one wash and dry they were too small to use. Not worth a penny in terms of diapers but great burp cloths and dust rags."
2,Used for many things but not for diapers.,"These are not the diapers I remember. In fact, you could not possibly use them as diapers - they are very very thin and even when folded would not hold in what needs to be contained. Obviously the company has changed the material they use in this product. I'm not sure why.They are however great for putting on your shoulder when burping your baby. Great for wiping up spit-up and drool. Great for tying around a toddler if you don't have a bib handy. And great to have in the car for spills. They are also okay for dusting furniture.Wish they were diapers though - since that is why I bought them."
2,Too thin and strange shape,These are just too thin to be used as diapers. They are also a strange shape which makes them difficult to fold to be used as diapers. I don't use them. They are just sitting in a drawer. I think I will try to use them as burp cloths as they are useless to me right now.
1,Thin and Scratchy!,"I just received these as a gift and will be returning them. I had intended to use them as burp cloths, but they are way too thin and not absorbent at all! You can see right through them. Plus, the fabric is really scratchy. Not at all what I was expecting."
2,Only good as spit/burp clothes,"These are fine for what I bought them for, burp clothes, etc. But I can't imagine anyone being able to use these as actual diapers. They feel as thin as cheese cloth. They also got even flimsier after the first wash."
1,The material is the same as cheesecloth!,"These are nothing more than pieces of cheesecloth, with sewn edges to prevent fraying. I have posted the picture to clearly show how unbelievably thin they really are. I can't think of anything other than squeezing the water out of cheese that I would be able to use these for. You can see right through the mesh material, so I wouldn't even think of blowing my nose, let alone diapering a baby, or chancing a good shirt on spit-ups with these useless see-through, cheesecloth squares. I'm completely baffled by the number of good reviews these, and similar Gerber cloth diapers get. It is as if the good reviewers have a different product for which they are writing a review for. I suggest shopping in person for cloth diapers, so you can actually see, and feel the material with your own eyes, before buying them."
1,Cheap and hazardous,"These are cheap and terrible. When I washed them before use, they nearly fell apart! Little pieces are coming off. I would never use these for burp cloths; the baby could choke on the pieces.Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White"
5,Make great cleaning cloths - soft and absorbent,"I ordered these to use as cleaning cloths, for drying wine glasses and for dusting. After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned as it seemed that some were not happy with the quality. All I can say is that I found these diapers to be extremely soft and washed well. As for whether or not these make good diapers, I haven't put them to that use so I can't comment, but for cleaning, I give these 5 stars!"
2,"Too thin, too corse","We are beginning to try cloth diaper systems and started with these as a first pass, as they were among the cheapest and best selling. I would not recommend them, as they lack the absorbance, softness, and durability I am looking for. In short, it's very cheap cloth and may be useful when double or tripled up for alternative uses. We will continue to use these only as a backup. I much prefer a natural cotton trifold diaper that we bought at a local store. It's twice the price but 10-times the quality."
2,Only okay,"I purchased these cloth diapers to use as a liner on the changing station of my pack & play. They are very thin, so I have to double them up and then fold them in half. They are absorbent (I have twin boys, so we have our share of accidents during diaper changes). Another reason that I'm not crazy about them is that I need to wash them by themselves; they release a TON of lint that gets all over the other items in a shared load. All in all, I would not purchase these again."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","Stay away. These are as thin as gauzy receiving blankets. At least get the 3-ply ones Gerber sells. Even those aren't great, but they have to be better than these."
3,Good for burp clothes,These diapers are too thin (gauzy). I purchased them to use them as burp clothes and they work fine for that function.
4,Good for what I needed them for,My husband uses these as sweat rags and I use them as dust rags. They last forever. Aren't as big as the last ones I got but this size works fine for us. Wash them with some fabric softener and they fluff up nicely.
2,shoulda known better!,"The product name is known forever but the flat diapers were way too thin for what I needed. The price was reasonable but much too thin. OK for polishing, cleaning, etc but not for my creations."
1,"Why, when you can get quality for the same price?","Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby. But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought ""cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations.""I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality. After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my ""diapering diapers"" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!"
5,I love it!,"Orignally I bought these to use as burp clothes but my baby does not spit up much at all and it feel funny to carry these around as burp clothes or wiping my baby face so I use it everyday to wipe my baby's bottom, after using the diaper wipes which always leave her bottom so wet, and also on ""air out"" time. Let just say, she does not have any diaper rash at all! Like other Mom said in their reviews, you can use it for so many purposes. Bleach does wonder to remove soiled diapers (if you don't use disposable diapers)."
1,Too thin for a burp cloth... how could they ever be used as diapers?,"I bought these with the sole intent of using them as burp cloths, since many other reviews have suggested this use. When I opened the package I was shocked at how thin the material is. I can actually see clearly through them! They also don't retain their shape at all after one washing.I wasn't upset at first because I knew I was not planning on using them as diapers. However, I folded the ""diaper"" in half to use as a burp cloth and the spit up leaked right through! Are you kidding me?I am irritated enough to have wasted money on not-so-great burp cloths... but I think it is terrible that Gerber uses the word diaper on the label. There is NO WAY these could be used as a diaper! The material is like cheesecloth!"
5,Cloth diapers: what was old is new again.,"These Gerber cloth diapers have a million and one uses. From actual diapers to burp cloths to changing pads, to just super absorbent rags, these diapers will be used again and a again. And because they are well made, they can be bleached and reused time and again, saving money and landfill space."
1,Beware! VERY thin!,"I gave these one star because I think they are unsuitable for the intended use as a cloth diaper. I bought these thinking they were comparable to the prefold cloth diapers that I have used as burp cloths in the past.... you should be aware that they are very, very thin. They are so thin that they are transparent. Even when I folded them they didn't seem half as thick and absorbant as the prefolds. The prefold diapers are much more suitable for cloth diapering and burp cloth use... spend the extra $$$ on them. These probably will make nice rags for cleaning.... but I definitely don't recommend them as diapers or burp cloths."
5,Burp Cloths (Don't Even Think Abt Using Them as Diapers),"These for cloth diapering? Um, no way. Way too thin for that. These for burp cloths? Absolutely! While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use, they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers. My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough... I cannot imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time. These are easily washed and inexpensive... admittedly not as pretty, but most mothers get over ""pretty"" real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time! lol"
4,best burp cloths ever!,"I would give these a 5, but I know this product is made as a diaper and I have never used them as such. But someone recommended them to me as burp cloths, and they're all we use! Fancy, pretty burp cloths aren't nearly as absorbent or quick-drying, and I don't feel bad about using them to wipe up whatever mess needs to be wiped up because they're just utilitarian cloths! They wash out pretty well, too. I hang-dry them, and they're still going strong after 3 months."
3,David Carretta - Kill Your Radio,"Some strong French techno from David Carretta on his second full-length for International DJ Gigolo Records, _Kill Your Radio_. And while the album's title might be onto something, I imagine it'd be quite a shock to hear a track like ""Lovely Toy,"" with its electroclash leanings, pumping out of an FM station. But the heavy thump of ""Te Quiero Me Amor"" would probably be too much, even for the most progressive of stations. The pure funky darkness of ""The Blue Box"" would have most speakers spitting out black, while the slightly off-kilter synths and mysterious vocodered vocals on ""Homer"" keep the listen off-balance. ""Ta Liberte C'est Ca"" takes a lighter approach towards the end, which helps lead naturally into the peppy ""Pop et Synthetique."" Soon enough, however, the title track and ""Extreme Body"" get things kicking again. So even if you do end up killing your radio, at least you'll have found a worthy replacement for it."
5,good,Love Rupert Penry Jones. Cannot wait to see how they develop his character in the next series... please tell me there will be a next series....
4,Gritty!,"As the topic suggests, this series has a very gritty feel to it. The murders are gory in their description, although in most of the episodes, they aren't overly graphic. I watch it for the plot and the characters who are very interesting in themselves."
5,Must watch!,"This series kept popping up as a show that is similar Luther and Sherlock and I ignored it for quite sometime. This weekend I found out what I had been missing! I don't really know why this series doesn't have more reviews because its brilliant! Dark, yet very funny! The dynamic between DI Chandler, Edward Buchan, and DS Miles is genius and having seen the second series it only gets better! Don't hesitate to give Whitechapel a go, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Engaging/Suspenseful,"I found this to be very engaging, well done, well acted, suspenseful and good drama. The characters are real people and not super-cops who never make a mistake."
4,Well done...,"Well done police procedural. Good story and character development. Intelligently written. I found the scene transitions distracting and annoying. Perhaps ""Jack"" will kill the scene editor next season."
4,Enjoyable,"Yes, it's formulaic, but what I really enjoyed the most was the tension between DI Chandler and Investigator Miles and his crew. The constant sparring and downright hostility that evolved into begrudging respect was wonderful to watch."
5,chapel,Best crime drama on tv. Whitechapel has so many lengends of ghosts murderes and other strange things.just finished watching series three. which is a hell of a lot darker and disturbing. should reaily have been put on later than nine oclock.
3,"Predictable, saw only the first episode","After enjoying ""life on mars"" and ""wire in the blood"", I thought I would enjoy this series. Maybe I cannot appreciate the ""style"" glorified in the other reviews, but the plot was pretty boring. A usual plot about a clean-cut high-rank by-the-book officer (DI) who has just been assigned to manage a bunch of slobs, in a dirty messy office, trying to catch a ""sophisticated"" serial killer. Sounds familiar? I did not find any sort of sophistication in the killer, the expert, the DI, or any of the wittiness/charm/charisma I expected from the detectives. Maybe it gets better, but think I'll spend my $1.99 somewhere else.."
2,Police without guns?,"I don't get it....Modern day London..Police Inspectors who go after crazed serial murderers and don't carry gun? Great acting, interesting characters, but why would police persons put themselves in harms way without any protection? Not even mace? or an ASP? Seems a bit odd to me.. Anyway, interesting story line until the ending of this first serious that was a real disappointment. I'll watch the second series only because I enjoyed the characters, especially Phil Davis and Rupert Penry-Jones and the rest of the DI team."
2,Misleading and disappointing,"I sat through all the episodes of this hunt for a Jack the Ripper copycat. They never caught him and the lead investigator whom the audience was led to root for got demoted at the end. In short, a disappointment."
3,Modern Day Jack the Ripper Puzzles British Dectives,"The tales involving Jack the Ripper are interesting, and this series deals with a Ripper copycat. I liked the main character, the sophisticated detective who was handed the job of solving the murder with the assistance of colleagues who didn't like him or his upper class ways. The British accents required close attention to figure out. Sometimes you just had to guess what happened. Worth watching"
5,WC S1,"Love it. Apparently, my BBC channel doesn't get near as many excellent British dramas as they should. Amazon Prime rocks."
5,Great British Show!,"I thought this was a well-written, well- acted series.The plots were intriguing.This was recommended to me by Amazon but I kept ignoring it. Now I can't wait to start season two.I will recommend this to my friends and family."
5,Great show,I just tried this because it sounded interesting and I liked it. I will definitely be watching season II. I enjoyed seeing the characters evolve.
2,This mailing DID NOT have the short story I asked for!! Bummer,"I needed a particular story by the great Richard Wright but unfortunately, although I specifically said this was the work I needed, the selection sent did not have it within! That was not a happy discovery!"
4,beautiful Michigan writing,"What I liked most about this book is that the majority of the essays are based in Michigan. I gave it an extra star just for that reason. I think if you're from Michigan and you flyfish, then you'll probably enjoy this book as much as I did. His writing style in my opinion is somewhere between Gierach and Lyons. In his essays, Jerry Dennis talks about his favorite fishing partners just like Gierach does. And, the pen and ink illustrations throughout the book are done in the same style as Gierach's books. Dennis writes realistically about fitting his love of fly fishing into an average every day life of a father, just like Lyons does. As far as writing about nature and fly fishing in Michigan I think this book deserves 5 stars. But, I didnt like the few fictional stories toward the end of the book. They were a little odd and had strange endings."
2,Not useful,"In my experience, this book was not helpful for Step 1 preparation. Partly because Behavioral Sciences is not heavily tested in the exam and clinical vignettes are time consuming. Also, I felt that by studying a standard review book alone, I was able to remember the distinguishing aspects of each disease. However I am sure there are many people who would find this book useful."
5,Seattle's Back,"Once being the grunge capitol of the world I haven't heard to much come out of Seattle lately until the band These Arms Are Snakes (well there was The Blood Brothers). I would like to give this cd a 4 because I feel they can still achieve even better than this brilliance, but a 5 it deserves so a 5 it gets. I'd compare them to the Mars Volta in their style as a kind of art post-punkcore band, whatever that is. The distortion, the jams, the shifts, I love all these parts and more to This Is Meant To Hurt You. Stever Snere is a great vocalist, distortion is often used on his voice and it fits perfectly with the music and Brian Cook is incredible at worst with his tempo-shifts and tones. These Arms Are Snakes have managed to pull off a great EP and I wait impatiently for the LP. This album changes from jams, to melody into frantic punk effortlessly."
4,Nice.,"I first heard of these guys because I think some of them were in the band Undertow back in the day.Anyhoo, this EP is quite good. I agree with the previous reviewer that there's a little bit of ""Mars Volta"" going on here, however I'd say it's more of an ""At the Drive In"" feel only with Neil Young on guitar some of the time. It's thick and layered and the vocals are there but not central. There is a sense of urgency and interesting lyrics and repition that breaks away to shifty song structure. You really don't know what to expect. I only give 4 stars because it's only an EP and they need to release an album ASAP, or else.****""Drinking From the Necks..."" is awesome!! The best track, lotsa surprises--not something that happens a lot with music these days."
4,An interesting look at the real Lewis,"Of course CS Lewis has proven to be the most popular Christian author of the 20th century. And for good reason. He's articulate, well-reasoned, and he certainly has a way with words. This book gives an inside look at Lewis as he corresponds with an American woman whom he apparently never met. The letters were written between 1950 until he died in 1963. If you like reading other peoples' mail (what is it, esp. we Americans have, with such things?), then this can make for interesting reading. Much of what he says here, though, is pretty trivial and doesn't get very deep. But if you want a personal glimpse of Lewis, its probably worth the read."
3,Informal and easy going correspondence,This correspondence between Lewis and an American lady was neither of poor nor outstanding quality. Average reading.
4,A literate and fun exploration of collective nouns,This is a great way to teach about collective nouns. It also makes a great starting point for students' own writing pieces and word collections.
4,Slow but Powerful,"A quietly devastating film. ""In the Bedroom"" explores what happens to a family unable to communicate when it is scarred by tragedy. Sissy Spacek gives as strong a performance as ever, but the movie belongs to Tom Wilkinson as her dutiful but distant husband. The movie meanders at times, but at it's core it makes a powerful statement of the common emotions that drive people apart and bring them together again."
4,Movie that runs like a book.,"People that hated this movie said it went nowhere. I know some folks that walked out of it. I enjoyed it. The scenes were set up well and objects needed to be noted for their place and their symbolism. The acting was tremendous as well as the realism of the characters. The movie captures the helpless feeling that one might get in the situation of losing your son, and the silent ending of a marriage. If you are a fan of Mr. Dubus and his writing you will like this movie. (or DVD)Set in Maine, the rural aspect, scenery as well as people is an enjoyable and important side note."
4,Interesting ....,"Marissa Tomei gives a wonderful performance in In the Bedroom. She is the best thing in the movie. I thought the script was slow, and unbelievable in the end. And though I love Sissy Spacek, I felt her character just was not deep or complex enough.It is an interesting story, but it could have been told in a much more intense manner."
3,well done but violent premise is flawed,"Those who appreciate good directing and good acting will appreciate ""In the Bedroom"", and the as the plot unfolds and the marriage of two leading characters disintegrates in the face of sorrow and accusations, we are treated to mature, skillful performances seasoned with nuances.However, like the marriage, the movie itself begins to disintegrate as the grieving father makes a series of extremely regrettable, irreparable decisions. Instead of veering toward revenge, I would have liked to have seen the parents work through their devastating situation to some kind of honorable resolution."
5,Haunting movie,"This movie is one of the most heartbreaking depictions of the agony of losing a child to a brutal murder.Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are just amazing as the parents torn apart by grief and anguish at the loss of their son.The justice system in the movie,as in real life,are more concerned about the rights of the accused then the victims of crime.Some have critisized that the pace is too slow but I think it's perfect for this movie.It's so realistic to see the parents struggle and suffer ever day.This isn't the time of movie to just get a few cheap thrills.This movie stays with you and really makes you think."
1,P U,I saw this in the movies. It was awful. I kept expecting something to happen. It didn't. It held the same rhythm throughout. I liked the actors. This movie was just yuk. I don't understand the high rating. 1 star is too good.
2,Overrated,"One of the more overrated films of the past few years - In The Bedroom mistakes pace for depth. While the majority of reviewers note the somber tone and deliberate pace of the film, it is really nothing more than an Egoyan-ish remake of Redford's Ordinary people mixed with any of the Charles Bronson Death Wish movies. Nothing new, nothing original, and designed to make one think that it contains depth that isn't there, In The Bedroom is as copmplex as your average episode of The West Wing, with all of the subtlety of a hammer to the side of the head."
1,Some movies comes out of the rectum,"And that is one of them.But I still try to understand how THIS can get any award. How can we criticize a movie that was created from nothing? No point, No interest, slow.""In the bedroom"", you won't have time to count sheeps, you will already be falling asleep .... dead....I recommand this movie to all that have sleeping disorder.Enjoy the movie!!!(If I could, I would have given NO star... )"
2,Too slow,"I was excited to buy this movie after all the hype and awards. But after viewing it, Im left wondering 'why'? I'm not one that has to have tons of action in a movie to be entertained, but it doesnt have to be THIS slow, either! The first few minutes of the movie told the viewer that there was a relationship between the son and the older woman. The extra 20 to 30 minutes of drivel continuing on this fact was pointless and it almost made me fall asleep. I perked up a bit when the tragedy occurred, but just as quickly, it grew mundane again. And the ending left much to be said. Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei are great actors, but this movie was just simply boring."
3,"So-So movie, take it or leave it.","This film is really a so-so film. Not great, but not bad. Worth renting, but overall I wouldn't buy it. Pay-per-view it...maybe."
2,Too Loooooooong!,"Although Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson were very good in this movie, it was too long and very slow moving. The actor who played Marisa Tomei's husband was stiff and not particularly believeable in the role. And again, too many pregnant pauses in the film."
1,Slow and depressing,"I'm sorry I wasted money on this film. While the acting was superb, the story line was hackneyed, and the pacing was so slow, I wondered if it would EVER END. And the ending -- my God, haven't these people ever seen a crime drama? Don't they know about forensics? What could these otherwise bright and well-educated people be THINKING???!!! I'm sorry, but the script writers themselves should have been shot for this one.If you MUST, wait for the video so you can use your remote to speed through most of the film, or go get a sandwich."
2,In the Bedroom,"I thought that the movie moved VERY slowly. The storyline was predictable and drawn out much longer than it needed to be. Many of the scenes seems unnecessary. It was chopped up a lot. The abrupt ending made you leave wondering why there wasn't something more to it. Throughout the movie, we kept waiting for something more to happen. The acting in it was good, but not anything out of the ordinary for the gifted performers in these roles. VERY disappointing!"
1,do not rent or buy,"this movie sucked. my boyfriend and i decided to rent this movie since it was up 5 times for the oscar. Boy were we wrong. we wanted to not only brake our tv, but kill each other too. it was very boring, most scenes did not involve any speech but just pointless things that waisted a lot of time. The pointof the movie i must say was alright, but it was not good for a 2 and a half hour movie. i strongly suggest you dont go buy or rent this movie!!!!!!!!"
1,Call me crazy but 1 star isn't low enough...,"I guess I missed something in this movie because it think it was the most boring, slow moving story I have ever seen! There were literally minutes of no words spoken all throughout the movie. I constantly battled whether I should just give up and quit watching it, or skipping several scenes just to get to the end. I'm sure I'm not the average movie critic, but I would say, Don't Waste Your Money!!!!!"
1,A good sleep aid,If you are tossing and turning in bed and can't get to sleep I highly recommend you watch this movie. It is so slow and boring that you will be fast asleep in a matter of minutes. Good thing I didn't put out money for this DVD. I checked it out of the library. So on the cover that it was nominated for awards. Who are these people that nominated this movie for an award anyway? The only redeeming quality of this movie was that the acting was good. Otherwise don't waste your money or your time. I wish that I could give this movie less than a star rating.
2,Slow Moving & Downright Boring,"Me and a few friends were intrigued by the trailer and it looked like a hard hitting drama...don't be fooled! It's soooo slow moving and mundane! At least we thought so, in fact I have never been to a film where at the end the whole audience moaned and booed and were whispering under their breath how bad it was. I don't know what the critics saw in this....Rent it first...."
2,Watch something else...,"Good premise, but very long and boring. If you want something really moving, watch 'Requiem For a Dream' instead."
1,Wait and rent it on DVD If you have to see it.,"I am not sure what they were trying to get through to the audience in this movie. There was so many camera moments of no talking, fade outs and well I just found myself very confused. The story of losing a loved one , domestic violence , how a family grieves and an unjust legal system is kind of thrown at the audience in bits and pieces. The movie does draw a conclusion at the end but only to leave you w/ another sense of ""huh?"".I really wanted to see this movie and left very disappointed. I expected based on reviews to be left w/ things unanswered but I never realized that the entire movie would be like this. There are moments in this movie that are very disturbing however I really felt they could have connected the characters and their story in relation to each other far better than they did.Save your money and go see I am Sam. A far better movie with a different plot but very good at reaching the audience."
1,Hyped for no reason at all,"This was one of , if not THE worst movie I have seen . I could barely watch the whole thing. Plodding and pretentious, hardly any good dialogue...If Sissy Spacek was allowed some great words instead of constant silence /brooding/smoking ...yes I understand the art of acting is not only the words but this movie had such a lack of stimulating dialogue. Sissy was the reason I saw it, as I love her work, but was deeply disappointed. Too much about the flat boring father, predictable pat ending, horrible actor who played the exhusband. Sorry to be mean but he seemed like a juvenile actor who in no way conveyed the depth needed to make his character seem real. It was like watching a high school play, (no offense to high schoolers ) .Do not waste your money buying this, unless you have seen it and know you like it."
