2,Design not as advertised!!,"The only similarity between what i ordered and what I recieved is that it has a refillable pouch. Otherwise, I was VERY disappointed because the mouse itself was not what I ordered and looks nothing like the advertised picture!"
5,robot chicken season two,"this item was shipped quickly, packaged securely, arrived in excellent condition, completely satisfied from start to finish."
5,"Real good, even better than 1st season","I own the 3 seasons of Robot Chicken, the first 2 are cool, the 3rd one is not as cool as the other 2"
5,ROBOT CHICKEN SEASON 2 UNCENSORED,"FUNNY IT IS ,MMM YES !!! OR SHOULD I SAY @#$% YES,,,OR BEEP YES ! ! IF YOU LIKE SICK FAST( I MEAN FAST) PACED SLAP YOU IN THE FACE HUMOR , THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU ."
5,Robot Chicken Rules!!!!!!,Either your a fan of Robot Chicken or your not. This 2nd season is every bit as hilarious as the first. Seth Green's best work. Probably the most underrated comedy ever produced.
2,"more of the same, but disappointing drop in humor","I really enjoyed the first season - some absolutely hilarious skits. However, unfortunately the creators seemed to have lost their muse on this second season. The poopie humor, sophomoric sex jokes, and foul language just doesn't have the sparkle of the first season :-)Bottom line: I wish I hadn't spent the money on this. :-("
5,What the-- when the hell did this become uncensored?,"Seriously, Robot Chicken was funnier with the bleeps in it. Let's hope this isn't true. Then again, the cover, but still."
3,Demented,"Dead chicken is brought back to life by mad scientist and forced to watch bad TV shows. Short (12-minutes per episode) TV series satirizes popular culture and network television with rapid-fire claymation vignettes. Imaginative-but-crude humor recalls ""The Groove Tube"" (1974) and ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" (1977). Viewers may also enjoy ""UHF"" (1989)."
1,Why Amazon sucks,"Amazon is horrible. I ordered the Robot Chicken Dvd Thanksgiving weekend to ship to my brother in Iraq. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS!!! (its Dec. 23rd now). The ""estimated delivery date"" said November 29.Thanks to Amazon, my credit card was charged for something that I have not received, and my brother's present will probably get to him, hmm maybe mid-February? The ""tracking"" info says it was shipped but not delivered. So I guess the blame is on the USPS? how can I be so sure.DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON.FYI- They do not let you fill out zero stars... so my one star rating above is because they do not allow zero."
3,still undecided,I watched a couple of episodes on TV... and laughed a lot.. decided to get the CD... watched it for a while... laughed a little... but really think this cd should be watched with a group of people... some of it is funny.. some not so funny... I feel that I could have spent my money elsewhere for better value..
3,awesome,i think this was hilarious.alot funnier than season 1. the fact that it was unrated made it a little funnier.my favorite skit from the whole season and series probably was the star wars skit. that was so freakin funny.this dvd is one of my favorites. i put it up there with some aqua teen episodes. i think seth green is a creative genius. i could set there and wath the whole thing.if u get this dvd you really would get your moneys worth.
1,bad,"This music has a word on it that takes away a person's personal power. I dont want to repeat it here, because i dont repeat filth!!Seriously! Why does Amazon sell this???"
2,Nothing but cliche's,"I bought this album on the strength of the two songs played on the radio but found the rest of the CD very poor, bland and full of cliche's. Don't buy this until you listen too it, there are much better CD's out there from other artists. Why settle with this?"
2,"just enjoyable, nothing more","Nothing earth-shocking, just some regular every day pop tunes. A CD you'd play on the odd occassion, every now and then. I find it funny how people compare Meredith Brooks to Alanis, however. Both styles - I find - are way apart. Maybe the mood set by Bitch got us all confused, I'd place Meredith in the same lane as Sheryl Crow. Though I'd go for a Sheryl Crow CD any day!"
2,not worth getting,"Everyone says if you like Alanis Morissette then get this album......but if you ask me...the only song worth listening to is Bitch.....I'm the biggest AM fan, but this album was borrrrrrrringgggggg...glad i bought the casette instead"
2,Nothing Special,"I'll admit, Bitch wasn't a bad single, nor was the cd complete trash, however there was nothing worthy of praise on this cd. Some of the major irritations about the cd is that she never really sings, only speaks notes. In othere words, she has no talent in singing. This CD is fine for a priew in the store, but not worth keeping in a collection."
2,Another jagged little pill...,"Carefully packaged anger,cliche attitude,the issues stay the same:I'm angry,I'm depressed and it pays.Wondering why?"
3,Um....whats to say. tries a bit to hard maybe.....,"Seems like she tries a bit 2 hard making this CD...Meredith does try to sound like Alanis, it's not working. It doesnt seem like Meredith puts that many emotions in her songs. THey all sound slightly the same and are basically about the same things.If you want a good female rocker, pick up an Alanis album..."
1,"No, no, no","Now let's make a few things perfectly clear: 1) Brooks is crassly trying to sound just like Alanis Morisette 2) She succeeds all too well 3) Her banshee wailing ""I'm a Bitch!"" is the stupidest lyric of the nineties."
5,Awesome,"I LOVE her--She really talks about how life gets to you sometimes,but-doesn't bring you down.This and Bad,Bad one are my relaxation music.Can't get enough of Merrideth--WHY in the world don't I hear more of her on radio??Highly recommend--Both cd's just orderedDeconstuction--I'm sure-- I won't be diappointed."
4,Laughed Out Loud!,"This book is a MUST for anyone facing infertility and is regularly subjected to that awful (AND RUDE) question, ""So when are you two kids going to have kids?"" Her responses to that question and many more are priceless. My only disappointment was that the book was more suited for couples facing IVF and have male factor infertility. But this was the first book I've read about infertility that really deals with the emotional coping aspect. And I'd much rather laugh than cry!"
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this book because it seemed funny and what I needed to bring my spirit up. It ended bringing me down even more! When you read it, it looks like a someone trying to get even at all those people that havent had this problem. It gives unworthy advise that only help you feel resented. For example, it says that if a friend of yours tells you she is pregnant what you should do is tell her that you had noticed that she was fat and had chubby ankles! I really do not recommend it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I had high-hopes for this tree because it showed a very high retail value, and I thought it could be very beautiful with red accents. Don't waste your money. It's very cheap and junky looking. I just put up the tree, and the lights on the top and bottom don't work. The only iridescent part of the tree is on the very tips of the branches. My kids hate this tree, and so do I. Maybe Charlie Brown might enjoy this tree."
5,Between The 1 and the 9,"Yeah. This is actually one of my top 10 favorites of all time (and it's unique, considering the kind of music I normally listen to). And it's like that because because of the period in my life that I first heard this CD; summer 1996 was just a good time. But I still listen to this one, compared to other CD's that pretty much lost their collective meanings."
3,Patti ... lose the anger,Dave did a wonderful job producing and structuring this project. I can't wait to hear what comes from Patti when she get's over the Bohemian Anger thing. She could be a major force in Rock. Raw talent at it's best.
5,Between the 1 & The 9,This is one of my favorite CDs. Patti Rothberg is a hidden talent. Every song on this album is good and most are even better than good.
4,"Good melodies, hooks and lyrics, why hasn't she made it big?","Patti seems a bit immature as a lyricist at times, but most of her lyrics are sharp and relatable, not obtuse like many other artists. And she does write some good hooks and melodies, and doesn't seem afraid of hooks and hummable tunes, a plus in my book over many modern ""artistes"". In short, some really good pop music. And she rocks too, in a good singer-songwriter way, not in an 80s hair band way. I'm really looking forward to her future work, but where is it?"
5,The greatest CD you're not listening to!,"Why you ask? It was released in 1996 and the single ""roll"" debued on alternative rock stations. I proceeded to go out and search for this CD the minute I heard that single. I consider this her first effort, to be somewhere inbetween Pattin Griffin's ""Flaming Red"" and Liz Phair's ""White Choclate Space Egg"". After that single died out I never heard from Patti again unless I played my copy of ""Between the 1 and the 9"". I waited 6 years for word of another effort by Ms. Rothberg. Finally, Candelabra Cadabra came out in 2002. I bought it without reservation and was dissapointed. There's so much grit on ""Between the 1 and the 9"" and it's great for when you're of mind to tell everyone you know to bugger off. Her latest release was just, well how do I put this... bizarre. Which is why you should try her 1996 release on for size; good rockin' music with an attitude, timeless."
5,Super Duper for those Power Free Moments!,"Love this baby! Keep it plugged into the outlet all the time. When the power goes off, Unplug this flashlight, push the prongs down into the unit and turn her on. Good light source and do not need to worry about batteries losing their power. For stability, the prongs could be made a bit longer, as the weight of the light causes it to tumble out of the electrical socket when bumped. Worth every penny."
5,Great book,"Just received from Kickstarter campaign -- am enjoying it, looks like I'll learn a lot. the illustrations look very clear."
1,"Very bad noise on ports 2,3 and 4","I needed to upgrade my KVM to allow for a wireless mouse. I decided on this switch to utilize the sound capability. On port one it was perfect but on the remaining three ports it sounds like I am attached to a heart machine, and I was busy having a heart attack. If you only need the wireless it is good although switching between ports can take a long time.Amazon did a fantastic job, I contacted them and they sent me a brand new unit, the only problem is that both units have the same problem. I tried new cables, seperating the unit from possible interference sources even another computer with no luck."
4,"Does what it needs to do, pretty well.","This switch does everything it is designed to do and it does it pretty well. All cables needed are included with the item and it is USB capable, which you have to have. It switches very fast between the 2 machines. I have one Mac hooked up and on XP machine hooked up. No problems using a USB keyboard and wireless USB mouse (Microsoft).Only ""issue"" I could find is that all 4 sides have cables coming out of them. So you can't really put it on the desk because it doesn't stay well and lacks a clean look. Could have worked with the design a bit more, but again, not a big deal, I'm nitpicking. It's a good product and took no time to setup."
1,Does Not Work With Windows 8,"Worked for a short time until I upgraded to Windows 8... Then my PC's would freeze... Could only recover my PC's by rebooting, then they would freeze again... Replaced it with my previous switch, by Belkin"
1,Bad batch or (cheaper) redesign?,"I bought this in February 09 and the USB ports burned out/stopped working while switching between computers in May 09. I noticed another vendor site with user ratings has a rash of negative reviews starting earlier in 2009 on a product that had been favorably reviewed during 2008.The video still works, but no matter what I tried to do with the USB mouse and USB keyboard (tried different USB ports, different mice and keyboards, multiple re-starts of computers), I could not get them to register with the connected computers. I am waiting to see what TrendNet's return policy is."
3,Good switch but....,"I found the switch very easy to set up, and overall is good value for money. The major issue I found with the switch is that it take 15 to 20 seconds to switch from one system to another.I have two laptops in my home office and only wanted to share a common keyboard and mouse between them. The switch is OK, but if you want to frequently switch between machines it can slow you down."
2,TRENDnet 2 Port KVM switch,"It was easy to set up my two computers using the switch butit is shaky at times and if I don't set the switch to computer ""1"" before booting up the computer the switch does recognize the computer. This happens with either system. Also, I'm running dual monitors on one system and when shifting from computer ""1"" to computer ""2"" the resolution changes and anything open on that monitor is shifted to the other monitor. I then have to open the properties click on nvidia control panel and then the screens change to the native resolution and everything is moved back to it normal configuration.The KVM also went completely out of sync and the only way to get it back in sync was to shutdown the computer, pull the power plug so the KVM could reset itselh.TRENDnet 2-Port USB KVM Switch Kit with Audio (Includes 2x KVM Cables) TK-209K (Blue)"
3,"Usable, with flaws","Purchased this to replace an Old Zonenet PS2 4-port KVM that did everything just about perfect. This however does not, One this I have encountered is the hot keys to go straight to a specific port with the software don't work. The default scrl-lck + scrl-lck works but I have to go around the circle get back to where the one before or use the buttons. I was spoiled by the zonenet one doing all that I liked. This isn't externally powered, which I like as I don't have to worry about that when I am switching around computers. The keyboard socket on the input side is really loose which may account for my having to unplug and re=plug after some switching to get the keyboard to work right. The buttons are not in a good location for me to use, that is why I like the hot keys. I didn't want to spend double on the models that would probably work right, so here I am."
1,Short Term,"I bought this in May, and was unable to return it in August. It is hiding in a corner of my desk, and is never touched. Randomly today the mouse port failed. I know it is the mouse, because my mouse works when I plug it directly into the PC. There was never any abuse to this product, it just seems nice, until randomly is craps out on you. I would save some money and buy a nicer product before I bought this."
2,"Had issues, returned. Got a software KVM.","I bought this item by mistake to use with a DVI and a VGA monitor. Of course, I was not able to set the display up because this is a VGA only KVM. However, I also experienced issues with the keyboard. Technically, I should have been able to switch the keyboard even if the DVI display didn't switch. My efforts were to no avail. This is when the mouse was switching with no problem. By the way, I just found out about the software KVM. If you have a home/office network you could use either Synergy or Input Director as a KVM! Both are freeware and easy to setup, especially the Input Director which is my favorite. Input director also allows you to share clipboard. I almost purchased a DVI KVM, and I'm glad that I didn't."
2,Trendnet 2-Port,"Bought this Dec 2007. Work as expected for quite some time. Last few months, i started to notice that if the active computer hibernates, you can no longer change workstation until you wake the computer up first! It's been that way for a month and now, Nov 2010, it just does not function any more. Dead after less than a year. You get what you pay for? Buyer beware."
4,Switch Kit,The unit works as advertised. I'm switching an Win 7 & Win XP machines. Driver issues with Win 7 didn't allow me to keep needed printers ect so kept both PC's and used same monitor and ky-bd. Cabeling is a little unhandy as they come into the unit from all sides. Good product !
5,Easier to set up than expected,"I consider myself somewhat tech savvy, however I had no idea how to install this product. The instructions were clear and concise.Things that I loved:1. Easy set up2. Small form factor3. Most of the needed cables were included4. No separate power source needed.Things that can be improved:1. This unit cannot be installed on a wall. There is no hook at the back to install it on the wall. As a result, it kind of remains hanging.A wall adapter would have made the set up much more neat."
1,Monitor resolution never worked for Windows XP nor Windows 7,"I bought this after some research and found that it was the only kvm that would work with a wireless mouse and keyboard from logitech, however I did not think there would be any problems with the Monitors.I have a 22"" Dell monitor and one pc with XP and another one with windows 7, the kvm did not detect the right resolution on any of those.After some research, it seems to be a problem with the design of the kvm and it is not compatible with windows 7 nor windows XP. Will return this as it did not meet my requirements."
1,USB Stopped working in 2 months,"I got this switch to use to save monitor space for schooling online. I have had good luck so far with Trendnet in the past and thought it would be fine. But after only 2 months, tonight after completing schoolwork on one PC, I switched to the other and it would not work, then switched back and it wouldn't recognize the USB on the first one. I have not contacted Trendnet yet, but I will. I know it was only 25.97 but that is too much for only a little over 2 months use."
5,Definitely a good product,"I bought this KVM switch for my home office so that I wouldn't have to crawl behind the desk to disconnect my monitor and keyboard from my desktop whenever I wanted to use my laptop with them. That was a complete pain. Now, I always have a waiting connection for my laptop and just by turning it on, the KVM switch automatically switches everything to my laptop.Also, imagine my delight when I plugged my Logitech Unifying Receiver into the KVM's USB port for my wireless keyboard and mouse and it just worked. No configuration or anything required. Saved me a lot of time and hassle and was definitely worth the money.Everything I needed (cables, etc.) was included. Not much else to say other than -Good buy, works as advertised."
4,Works well.,"Works well, just what I needed to set up a second computer, migrate my files, and operate them together for a while. There is a slight lag for the USB in switching between computers. Maybe because I have a wireless USB keyboard and mouse, it takes a few seconds to transfer to the second computer. Not a big deal. Great product at a good price."
5,"Looks like ""The Thing""","Even thou this switch isn't the best looking or the most convenient KVM, it does work!! A better design would be to stack all the ports in the rear. I'd rather have an ugly switch that works than a pretty one that doesn't."
4,Good product,Work as it said. Even work on my HP wireless keyboard and mouse. It just a little bit slow when switching on computers.
5,Exactly what I needed,"My girlfriend and I moved into a new place... both of us have desktop computers but only one monitor was worth keeping and there is only one desk... this handy gadget allows us to share the same monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse, and microphone, while giving us the ability to switch between computers with the click of a button! Works perfectly and looks cool too!"
1,"When working it's fine, but sadly it is rarely working and disconnects constantly",Though one can enjoy the 'ding' of a usb device being unplugged I hear it all to frequently. I will be typing something (like this review) and my keyboard and mouse will stop responding. The light on top of the unit will flash and then I hear another ding that it has re-connected to the computer.Having gone through TWO of these units I would be very wary to purchase it. Though the price is amazing ($18 now though I spent $25 on mine) it isn't worth the headache and I am looking at other options as I can't stand the disconnecting anymore.
2,Works Well Initially then Breaks after six months,"Me and a co-worker purchased this because it was cheap. I pretty much broke after six or so months. I would suggest IO gear, because others have found it more reliable. My 2 cents..."
2,It's questionable,"I have Windows 7 and Windows XP. I wanted to use both but when switching to one another, my wireless mouse and key board doesn't seem to work with it. I will keep experimenting with it and hopefully I will get it to work.I was surprised at how small the KVM switch is compared to the pictures on the internet.I also notice that when I switched computers, things became distorted on the monitor.I wouldn't suggest buying this one. Maybe a 4 port KVM switch box might be better."
2,Problematic with laptops,"I was hoping the negative reviews with this product were a one off situation but it would appear it is much broader. The device does appear to work pretty well with standard desktop computers but my experience with a connected laptop was a lot less pleasant. When I connected the laptop it would randomly switch back to my desktop computer while I was trying to work. I don't think that I have anything too unique connected:standard corded Dell keyboardLogitech corded laser mouseSamsung 19"" monitorI tried shutting down the desktop but the keyborad/mouse would freeze every 2-3 minutes when it tried to switch switch over to my desktop which was powered off. The KVM didn't freeze up completely but it is far from a stable product in my eyes."
3,Works OK.,"The switch works fine, but occasionally I need to reboot my primary PC because the switch doesn't recognize it when I switch from the secondary PC to the primary. I checked online for any ""fixes"" but couldn't find any. Because it happens infrequently, I decided to keep the KVM switch."
2,Switch kit no consistent performance,"This unit has been unreliable in a mixed Windows environment. Using XP(ok), Vita and Win 7, with laptop and desktops. Will work with all connected one time then not the next. VGA is the problem- audio works consistentlyacross the units connected."
2,does not work well with docking stations...,"... according to customer service, and no where is this documented. works great with XP desktop and lenovo laptop but when laptop is in the docking station windows needs to boot up to the sign on screen before it switches over which means hibernation on lid closing has to be disabled. Windows 7 (which is otherwise GREAT, BTW) desktop is also flaky. once it's running and hibernates, it comes up fine but when system is shut down it will not come up on the switch, I have to move the cables. which of course, defeats the purpose."
5,Good performance,"This product performs, for me, exactly as presented in the offer to sell. Two desk tops, one with XP and one Vista, working very smoothly. Good product; good price."
1,Broke After 1.5 Years,The port for PC 1 and one of the USB ports stopped working after only a year and a half. There not much point to a KVM switch if the PC connections don't work!
4,Amazing value. Works flawlessly. But...,"I was a bit skeptical that a KVM kit with cables could be this cheap and still work well. I gave it a try and after a few months, I'm convinced! I've used it with machines running XP, Vista, and Windows 7 RC. No functionality issues at all, and the cabling seems to be good quality.However, the unit is very small and light. It's not much bigger than a deck of cards, which is ok, except that its very light - so light that the cables are heavier than the control box. This leads to a strange situation in which the box may not sit flat on the desktop if the cables are not laying flat themselves. Also, since the cables come out of the box in all four directions, you need quite a bit of room to keep things neat.I beleive TRENDnet would be better off to make the control box just a big bigger and heavier. This would enable the cables to come out of the back and lay neatly. Ironically, this would actually take up less room on the desk."
1,Slow & video problems,"I can't recommend this KVM for the following reasons:Switching between systems is extremely slow sometime (in excess of 30 seconds).Changed my video settings every day because it would switch it to 800x600.I went back to my PS/2 KVM with USB adapters for my mouse and keyboard and everything is good except for one minor issue (which is why I wanted to switch to a USB KVM).I hope someone comes up with a USB KVM that works, this one doesn't."
4,Mostly as good as advertised...,"This thing is working as advertised. Signal is strong, audio sounds good, regardless of the computer the signal is coming from.Two reasons why I'm giving it 4 stars vs. 5. One, as another reviewer noted, this thing when all plugged in, literally has wires coming in from all sides. So, it's kind of a challenge to place.Second, the audio cords are shoooort. I had to completely reorganize my workstations under the desk (2 pcs, two monitors, wacom cintiq, wireless router, etc. It was a bit painful) to get all of the wires to reach properly. Buuut, now that everything is organized, I'm really happy with the results.But yeah. Monitor cords about 4 feet, audio cords about three or less.However, outside of that, I would recommend with vigor."
2,Worked Initially...........,"Out of the box the product seemed a little cheap. However, I connected it with ease and the product worked fine. Over the past 3 months, the switch began to malfunction.The hotkey function failed and I had to unplug and re-plug the cables to re-set the unit. The fix worked. I had to do the same a few weeks later on the other switch I bought. Now the keyboards and mouse (on both switches) become non responsive following switching, requiring unplugging and re-plugging of the USB cables.Pay a little more and get quality.. I purchased the IO-Gear 4 port switch for another set of workstations and it switches smoothly and am, after 4 weeks, still very satisfied."
1,"Worked well, but not durable","Bought this item in March, and it just died on me 2 days ago. Worked really well, though. Used this to connect a Windows 7 box and a Macbook. Definitely has durability issues. Looking for a different brand for the next one."
1,doesn't work with multiple OS devices,The KVM doesn't work if you try to connect two devices with different operating systems. I have a Linux and Mac and it only works with Linux but not the Mac. Or if I connect a Linux computer and a Windows computer then the Linux device works but not the Windows computer. Company says a fix is being worked on but no ETA for it. Their tech support hotline isn't too helpful.
5,Easy to set up and works great!,"Easy to set up...just follow the directions. I had seen some reviews that said there were problems with wireless keyboard and mouse, but I had no problems. Plugged the wireless connector into the keyboard port, and since I use a trackball, plugged it into the mouse port. Amazingly, the wireless mouse also works...a bonus."
4,Works great.,I use this to switch between my laptop and iPad while doing presentations. This works great and solves the problem of switching cable every time.
5,Awesome!,"A wonderful switcher that lets me hook up 2 laptops, 2 monitors, & a docking station. Highly recommend - works just as advertised!"
4,Nice bang for the buck!,This is very nice for such little dough. The only thing that I would complain about is that it is slow to change. Then you have to wait for the computer to install the drivers.
4,Functions flawlessly but cables too short,"This KVM switch works flawlessly with an XP desktop and a Mac laptop.However, hot key switching does not work on a Mac. Therefore, the unit must be kept on my desk within reach so I can use the buttons for switching. Given the impractically short cables the unit barely reaches the very back my desk and kept falling off the desk. I was forced to mount it to the desk with double sided tape.Despite the short cables I think this was a great buy."
1,Zapped video card in both computers,Worked great for a month. Then it zapped the video cards in both computers in one day. Not a happy customer.
2,device redetection issues are serious drawbacks,"The TRENDnet 4-Port USB KVM with Audio is an unacceptable solution for many automated testing conditions.When switching from system to system, USB device redetection commonly occurs, which can cause problems with certain automated testing scripts. Additionally and more seriously, the video resolution on some Windows 7 systems will change if the system is not the active client on the KVM, particularly if a reboot occurs while the client is not selected on the KVM.On the positive side, video signal quality is good at 1920x1080 @ 60Hz. Keyboard and mouse functionality has never dropped on an active client, which occurs often with certain IOGear KVMs. Audio support is solid.For very basic uses, the TRENDnet KVM's flaws are annoying but generally acceptable considering its relatively low price. However, IOGear products only slightly more expensive do not suffer from the same drawbacks."
4,2 port switcher,"Worked okay but I found that my system supported HDMI ports. When this switcher, resolution was limited to the VGA connection. I think this set up works well but for my purposes I have to have a HDMI 2 port switcher. No offense against product, did what was advertised, but I needed higher resolution. Quality of construction and all the wires necessary were right in the box."
5,Excellent Product,"I use this to share a monitor, USB mouse, USB keyboard & speakers between two computers, one running Windows XP and a much fancier Windows 7 machine used for video processing. This switch works very well, making rapid transitions between the two machines really simple. Installation could not have been simpler. No problems!"
2,"Doesn't work for Mac/Windows combinations, possibly not Windows 7 compliant","I tried to set this up between a Mac OSX 10.6.X machine and a Windows 7 machine. Once you transition away from the Windows 7 machine, your USB devices get ""stuck"" to the Mac OS machine, and you won't be able to use them again until you power the Mac down. I don't know if this is a Mac<->Windows problem, or a Windows 7 problem, but either way, frustrating.That doesn't make this entirely useless - turning off the Mac is already my usage pattern - but I'd definitely think twice if you're in the market and planning to do anything similar."
1,Doesn't work,"I was pretty excited about getting this KVM switch, but after hooking it up, i was pretty disappointed. When i hooked it up i found out although it says it works with a pretty high resolution, (i have an lcd screen) everything seems fuzzy and doesn't look that good. there was no way i could get it to work."
2,Stopped working after 3 weeks,"Initially I was disappointed with this item because each computer recognised it as a new USB device everytime I switched between computers. This stopped, or I got desensitized, after a week.At the start of the fourth week of use, I turned off the computer for about an hour. On turning it back on, the screen began flickering. Further investigation revealed that the KVM switch had stopped working.This is the worst Trendnet device I have ever purchased, and I have purchased quite a bit."
2,Does not work,Only works with one computer. Both have XP professional on them and the monitor should work but it doesn't and I've tried different things to make it work.
1,Doesn't work,"I admit I have little patience with electronics. I expect things to work as described and this did not. I had very high hopes that this unit would be a low-cost solution to my problem and not have to squeeze 2 large monitors on my small desk which is visually irritating to me. After following directions explicitly, I got a big fat nothing. My computer would not even boot. After multiple trouble shooting sessions, my patience flew out the window and I gave up and sent it back. I'm dealing with the visual clutter until I can think of another solution."
1,DISCONTINUED MODEL - nO WIRELESS SUPPORT,"wHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. after tinkering with it for 2 hours i COULD NOT GET THE 2ND COMPUTER TO WORK W/ THE KEYBOARDS. USED A WIRED KEYBOARD AS THIS kvm does not support wireless keyboards. regardless of what we tried we couldn't get PC2 to respond to the keyboard and mouse. Customer support was no help. PC1 has windows 7, pc2 has windows XP. When the KVM is hooked upthe support specialist had me plugging the keyboard directly into the PC. didn't matter .. the best I could do is get it to work with one pc W/ A WIRED KEYBOARD AND MOUSE PLUGGED INTO THE kvm.."
2,Poor quality,"It worked for the first two weeks. Then, it stopped switching between PCs. The indicator light would keep blinking and neither keyboard nor mouth would work. Rebooting PC would help sometimes but not always, however, I should not have to reboot my PC every time i need to switch to it.I'm returning it. Very disappointing."
5,Works Well!,"Works well, and unlike other KVMs, you don't have a huge mess of wires coming off of it. Can't complain."
3,Nice KVM......Until It Stops Working,"I purchased the TK-209 in December of 2010 to enable me to share a bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo and my monitor between home and work laptops. The device was easy to setup, and I had very few issues with it. Then, after almost six months of use, the unit simply stops working. Up until that point I had been happy with the device.Edit: I found that by unplugging the video cables from the KVM and then re-attaching them, the KVM would start working again. While I'm glad I didn't have to buy a new KVM, it is inconvenient since I have had to do this 3 times in the past 2 weeks."
5,Does its job,"It works just fine, one computer with Vista, one with Windows 7. No problems at all. Love having two computers share one monitor, keyboard, and mouse."
4,ok,"Not sure how KVMs tend to work, but it disconnects the USB devices entirely from the machines, not even leaving up a dummy.. as such, windows occasionally ""forgets"" and takes a while to re-initialize the mouse and keyboard. OpenFirmware on the classic macs I'm developing on will completely ignore the keyboard when it is reconnected. OS X doesn't have any issues, I'd expect linux to have no issues too, so it's just windows and OpenFirmware(Similar to BIOS on PCs but a lot more powerful) that have a problem with that behavior. Beyond that, it works perfectly."
3,Not compatible with Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10,"Love the KVM switch in general, I'm just disappointed that the newest versions of Ubuntu (11.04 and 11.10) don't work with this switch and I can't find a replacement."
1,Worthless,"It worked for a couple of months and then lost its mind.Now it can not keep the keyboard/mouse in sync with the monitor.For example, when the switch is on port 2 the mouse/keyboard are properly directed to the computer connected to port 2. However, that computer can only detect the monitor when any of the other 3 ports are selected on the KVM.Don't buy this item. I've had better luck with Belkin hardware.Look for a unit that will emulate the monitor to the ports that are not currently selected so that you can be working on one PC while booting another. Otherwise you have to set the KVM to the port of the booting computer so that the hardware will be detected. Life is too short to twiddle your thumbs waiting for each PC on the KVM to boot in sequence. With the monitor emulation feature on the KVM, you can boot all the PCs at once and all will believe they have detected your monitor."
1,Junk,Works for a week and then starts having problems dropping connections. Not long after that it stops working completely.
4,Works,"Worked like a charm right out of the box. Audio and video quality are good. Switches quickly. Have a minor issue with my touchscreen laptop and HID (human interface device) complaining, but this sort of thing is somewhat expected and not a KVM issue, per se, IMHO."
4,Pretty good,"This is a fairly good product and works basically as advertised. I have a Windows XP PC and a Linux server connected to it. It switched just fine between both using a usb wireless mouse and keyboard. The only issue I have with it is that the mic does not work when plugged into the switch. I have to plug it directly into the port on the PC to use it. So, basically the mic is not switchable. Not a big deal for me, but cant give 5 stars based on all advertised functionality is not there."
4,"Worth the money, but...","If you have two computers side by side and both are always turned on, then this piece of equipment is for you. It's very easy to hook up, works with the ""number"" key on the keyboard but here's the problem I had. It took me a few days to figure out that if one computer is shut down and you're trying to use a chordless mouse with the other computer, the chordelss mouse acts ""jerky"" and ""unresponsive"" at times. BOTH computers need to be turned on for this not to happen with the chordless mouse. It probably works just fine with a chorded mouse and keyboard. This switcher is however, a great product for the money!"
3,Wouldn't work between a mac and pc,"This thing worked just fine between 2 pcs but wouldn't work with a PowerMac Dual G4 with USB. When switching back to the mac it would lock OS 10.4 completely, forcing a reboot. I did indeed return it and amazon credited my money back quickly.Thanks Amazon! I would seriously consider going elsewhere if you want to be assured of Mac compatibility."
5,Good KVM switch,"I am using this KVM switch with a computer running Vista Premium, and another computer running XP. I read a review that said this switch would not work with video cards, but I am running it with an NVIDIA Quadro card and it works fine."
3,Broke in Under 2 Months,"This USB KVM Switch worked great when it was working, but stopped working after about 1 1/2 months of daily use. What happened is the buttons that switch it from one computer to the other didn't have any effect anymore when pressed. I was very disappointed, but I didn't take the time to contact the manufacturer, so they may have done something for me, but honestly I didn't feel like fussing with it."
4,Works as specified,"It worked right out of the box after assembly. It came with every cable combination. It lets me use dual monitors with my laptop without a docking station, while sharing a nice monitor for my desktop. The only thing I would have liked differently is:1) Longer speaker and mic. cables to PCs. They are sufficent but it would have been nice if the 4 ft cable was about 6ft.2) I find it slow switching between computers. It takes seconds for the mouse or keyboard to activate on switched over computer. I see the display immediately but there is a delay for the keyboard which is slightly annoying. Not sure if its my Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse that makes it extra slow, but I do not want to go back to wired since its just more cables in a small work environment..."
2,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for with this product. Setup is a breeze, ease of use is 10/10, but after about six months, the USB connections stop working. If you read enough of these reviews, it's not too difficult to figure out that's exactly how they designed it to work (or not work, as it were). It's a great product when it works, but expect to re-up for another $18 twice a year."
4,Good product for Linux and Windows,It works great on my linux and windows vista boxes. Only thing is that when I switch back to the Windows Vista it re-registers the USB keyboard and mouse everytime. This tend to get Vista to get stuck!
5,Very decent KVM for a good price,"Like other reviewers I was somewhat suspicious at first when I saw the relative low price of this device compared to similar products. However it turned out that the two units we bought work flawlessly. We used the TrendNet 2 KVM to switch between a Windows XP - Windows XP and a Windows XP - Linux box. The switching time is between 3 and 5 seconds, re-synchronizing the USB devices takes longest, the image is switched quicker.In summary: The TrendNet 2 KVM is a good product at a good price that works as advertized. - I'd buy it again."
4,Does what it says,"Worked as expected right out of the box. No issues in setup and cables were all there. A bit slow on the switch but other than that, works like a champ."
1,TRENDnet 2-Port USB KVM Switch Kit w/ Audio (Includes 2x KVM Cables,"If you want old tech buy it, won't work with new video cards out there, not much else to say about this item"
1,This is horrible,I purchased this item and it stinks. I went through the trouble of plugging everything in and then it didn't work. The stupid thing would not even receive power to it. When I called technical support all they said was oh return it for am RMA. Waste of time I do not recommend this product at all. Returning to the store.
1,NOT MacMini or Mac laptop compatible,"After reading many reviews about this product, and read the description that said it is Mac compatible, I ordered one. When it arrived, I took it out of the box along with the cables, and lo and behold, I found it is NOT Mac compatible. It only comes with 2 VGA/USB male ended cables. I have an Acer AL2223W monitor which has both VGA and DVI-D inputs and cables; however, both my MacBook Pro and my Mac Mini only have DVI-D inputs. My old Mac PowerPC G4 had both VGA and DVI-D inputs. Too bad Apple didn't include this feature with their laptops and Mini.Guess I'll have to return it and keep looking for something that will work."
1,"Piece of CRAP, don't waste your time or money!!!","This KVM switch is such a Piece of CRAP, seriously...don't waste your time or money!!! If I could give this thing zero stars I would. I had to get 2 of these because the 1st one I received arrived DOA, Amazon was great about sending a replacement however after I connected everything up, the lights came on (which was better than the 1st one), but when I switched from PC1 to PC2 and back to PC1...my mouse and keyboard were non-responsive, even after I shutdown the PC and restarted it, so this time I requested my $$$ back."
4,very good product,When I first opened the box and saw how small the unit was I was a little skeptical as to how well it would work. The unit comes with all the required cables needed to connect my two computers and was easy to setup. Switching between the two computers is quick and easy and I like that the unit is small and takes up very little room on my desk. I have been using it for several months now and have no problems.
4,Works well,"Works well. Easy to set up. A bit unruly looking since cords plug into all four sides. Can't just put it up against a wall. But does its job and for a good price, so I'm happy."
4,Great little KVM,"I am using this to replace an IO Gear KVM of similar design. I just bought a Logitech Wave Cordless set and the IOG didn't work with it either in Vista or Mac. This TrendNet was recommended on the Logitech Support site. Well, it works great! All my functionality is now there! My only complaint is the softkey doesn't work on the Mac side (the IOG did!). Everything else is superior. The addition of a hard switch, sound delivery is superior, I always had to jiggle the IOG, same cable no jiggling. Works with one USB dongle for KB & M so much less cables on my desk. I would like a future design to be a little taller and put all the connections in and out on the rear. Clean front, just lights and maybe the buttons on the front."
2,Worked great till it broke,"Easy to use and setup. Then after about six months both PC and laptop stopped recognizing USB, making it pretty useless. The monitor switching still worked."
5,A Product That Really Works,"This product is exactly what I needed to link my two computers to one monitor, mouse, keyboard and speakers. I works exactly as advertised but does have some small quirks to get used to when running a computer for the first time. There is no written setup manual included but it does have some printed pictures to help hook up components. The manual is on a CD. The one irritant is that it takes a while for the mouse drivers to be recognized thus making mouse functions impossible when first connecting a new computer. Be prepared to somehow manually override the mouse to finish the setup. Once hooked up and with components recognized it is a super product that really performs well and is easy to use."
2,Lag Between Switches,"although the device works fine, easy to setup, etc. When it came to switching between systems, there was a very noticable lag around 5 to 10 seconds. If you plan on using this device and the lag is not an issue, it does the job. Im told IOGear makes one that has no lag,I will try that next"
3,Doesn't work well with USB 2.0 and neither corporate computers,"I had two LENOVO laptops from my company. They didn't accept this KVM switch well and I had to do several workarounds to make it work with my Dell monitor. The video quality output is not as good as if you plug directly on the laptop. The device also does not support well my Logitech K520 keyboard and mouse. My HP printer won't work well too as it uses USB 2.0. Too bad it is too late to return the product, but, I had a 2 month experience with it and that was enough.It did worked well with my personal toshiba and HP laptops, but still had issues with the keyboard, mouse and printer due to the USB limitation."
3,Worked great for 14 months,"I was really happy with this for 14 months. Suddenly it stopped working for the mouse, keyboard and sound on the second computer while still working on the first. I still get the internet on both computers though. Maybe I should be happy it lasted this long, but I would have felt better if it held out for another couple of years."
5,KVM Switch - Good job,"The Trendnet 2-Port USB KVM Switch works on my bench running two computers with a single Keyboard, monitor, mouse, speakers, and microphone. I use the buttons on top to switch computers. I didn't load the software, didn't need it. I am quite satisfied with the purchase and the performance of this unit. Good job TrendNet."
2,"Works, but noisy video and audio","Have this hooked up to an Inspiron laptop we use only as a file server 24/7, and my Lenovo Thinkpad base station. KVM switch installed perfectly and functions as designed, but after a month I noticed noise in the audio and in the video. There's low-level static coming through the external speakers and a sort of waviness on the monitor. Noise went away when I bypassed the KVM switch."
2,Cheap quality,"After receiving the product and plugging everything in, I was kind of disappointed with the behavior. Very frequently both my USB keyboard and mouse would stop responding. Occassionally, the problem would correct itself but very often I had to unplug and replug them to get the system to respond again. Both devices work fine when connected into the main computer or other USB hubs. I probably won't be buying any mroe trendnet products."
5,Great product,purchased this unit 1month ago and I am very satisfied.The only problem is when I setting 2nd computer this unit doesn't configure mouse and key board but later after I play little time it works well. after that everything is great and very comfortable and this audio support is great and price is pretty good too. I strongly recommend this unit for who have 2 computer with one monitor. ^^
2,Couldn't work for Windows 98,"Like the title says, I couldn't get it to work for my old computer which ran Windows 98. But it works great for Vista."
2,USB keyboard and mouser,"I bought this one in a couple of weeks ago. The first two weeks works very well. Starting last week, the switch will loose connection for the USB keyboard and mouser after you switch between 2 computers. Especially after one of the PC went to screen saver mode. I don't know what happen. I hope I can find way to solve this issue. I am thinking to return this unit."
3,Sometimes there is a Keyboard issue,"I have had no issue with this KVM fro video or Mouse operation, but sometimes the keyboard USB connection will stop working."
3,"so far, 50% functional","I bought this to connect my older GW desktop and older Dell laptop to the same keyboard and mouse, as well as speakers. The switch works 100% for the desktop, however, the mouse and keyboard do not function with the laptop docking station. Additionally, it does not appear to work with the laptop direct connections, but I have not given up on it yet!"
1,Did Not Work!,"This KVM switch did not work from the beginning, and I tried everything I was supposed to, including sending an emial to tech support, which gave me nothing. So, unfortunatly it did not work and I returned it for a Refund>"
1,This is a defect one,The one I brought has a defect which one of USB port is not working. How I should return and exchange to a new one?The problem is I already threw the original box away already. I can use the new package box to exchange it.Please advise.
2,Disappointed!,"This is the second TRENDnet KVM USB Switch, last purchased in Dec 2011 is fried again, the previous one lasted a year, this one 7 months. Pathetic reliability extremely poor,when it is functioning it is a 5 star winner."
2,has trouble,"Does not work properly with the USB Mouse on Windows 7, double clicks when I single click on a regular basis. It also has trouble with VMware Player or Virtual PC in that when the VM becomes active the device will sometimes switch consoles."
2,TRENDnet 2-Port USB KVM Switch Kit with Audio,"I bought this switch to switch between an XP and a Windows 7 desk top. It works good, except for the audio, that only works off Windows 7, not off of the XP. When I plug the audio cable directly into the XP it's o.k. I ""fixed"" it by giving each computer its own speaker so no big deal, but a little annoying. It may be unique to my set-up, but if you need the audio and don't want to take any chances, don't buy it."
1,LockUpCity,70% of the time it works perfectly. The rest of the time I had to do one of the folowing:1. cntrl/alt/delete so I could switch to the other windows I had open after a switch back.2. unplug/replug the mouse due to it being unresponsive3. having to hit ScrLk (a shortcut this port uses for switching from a to b)multiple times until the screen would stop flickering after switch back.I even took the time to use 3 different (new) monitor cables.Not sure why they bother with the disc at all. (I did install it though)I am using a new system.HP 6400 with 3g ram with vista with a hpw2207 monitor x2Unfortunately I purchased this to use while broadcasting for the online radio. The box decided to lock up the screen in the middle of a show and had to call for another DJ to pick up so I could disconnect/uninstall.I personally would recommend people stay clear of this product.
3,Great but a bit unreliable,"The unit works well, it's pretty easy to set up, and very compact. The buttons to switch between computers are a bit small. My main gripe is that sometimes the unit stops responding. This typically happens when you've switched back and forth several times in a short time span (e.g. 5 times in 15 minutes). I rarely use my other machine, so it's not a big problem, but if reliability is important, you might be better off with a different product. But for incidental switching, it works well, and at a great price."
5,It just works!,"Switcher does just what described and does it with no issues. It seems like they expect some people to have the device sitting on top of the desk, so it is within reach, but I don't know who would do that. The device has cords coming out of all sides, not a big deal when you mount it under the desk like I did, but would be annoying if you expected to put it on the top of the desk. Using with older PC's, one with WinXP and one running RedHat. Both have PS2 ports, but both my keyboard and mouse are USB only. Everything still worked great."
4,Ugly but works. New Mac Mini + PC. Not using monitor connection.,"So this cheap little box isn't as pretty as the Belkin switch, but I'll ""put a bag over it's head"" and pay $26 for this vs. $130 for the pretty model.As the first reviewer here said, it works fine with Mac Mini and PC switching. I'm not using the monitor connection, but the keyboard, mouse, and audio all switch over fine. My Mac Mini is the new 2011 version with Thunderbolt and HDMI video ports and I'm using the HDMI direct to my monitor. The PC connects via analog VGA. So occasionally I have to use the monitor menu buttons to switch inputs if both computers are on. Not a big deal really.I did not bother with the included software. I just click the button on top to switch computers."
3,"Great product, when it works","I like these switches -- they're well designed, easy to use, and work with Mac and PC. I had one of the 2-port switches that I used rarely, and it lasted a couple of years. I just bought a couple of this model, and one died after a couple of months of heavy use. Haven't dealt with the manufacturer about it yet.... We'll see how long the other one lasts, but I might switch to a different brand to replace the one that died. My hunch is that these are better for light use."
4,Works Great but..,This product works great for being able to hook two computers to one monitor But...#1. You need to have computer speakers that plug into wall instead of using usb power so that no matter which computer your on the speakers will have power to work.#2. I had to hook up monitor directly to computers first one at a time and then unplug and hook up Trendnet port to monitor and computers because some reason the computers had problems displaying on monitor if I hooked up the Trendnet port first to monitor and computers.
4,Works as expected,Does what I need it to do for the price...would have been great if the output was hdmi instead. I am using my monitor to switch computers for the screen.It has made my life easier with no need to physically move from desktop to laptop anymore. Con- it takes about 3-4 secs to switch from my laptop to PC but much less the other way. Pretty cool device.
1,Garbage - Don't waste your money,"This simply doesn't measure up. The switching has problems with Virtual Machines running, Outlook running, or other unknown combinations. The only solution that I've found when it stops switching is to completely shut down all of my machines and then reboot them at the same time. Completely frustrating product!"
5,Great Device,"If you are looking for a way to share your one monitor with your 2 computers without having to switch cables for keyboard, mouse, speakers and, of course, monitor, than this is exactly what you are looking for! It's fast switching and it's small so it fits in inconspicuous places. Definitely recommend!"
2,Too cumbersome and some quirks,"I don't like it because of all the cable mess and it did not recognize my logitech mouse. It also required a straight through vga cable for my LCD monitor which I fortunately had but was not using before. I bought it to share between a laptop and a desktop which I discovered is not that good because the laptop's screen resolution is smaller so I don't really get more screen usage like the desktop but that's my misconception, not the product's fault."
2,Too good to be true and it is.,This is just what I need and the price is right. You can change computers by pushing a button on the device or you can use a shortcut key. I like it very much and now I will find out how long it will last.PS It lasted about 3 months and it slowly stopped working. Too bad. It was wonderful when it worked.Saint Jack
5,Works well,"Completely satisfied, used this KVM switch on a XP and a Vista Machine and it was completely plug and play, it came with a disk but I didn't need to use it."
3,works....but,"Product is a little unwieldy and has a cheaper feel. In retrospect, I probably should have compared more. Overall, it does what it is supposed to, but it is a cable monster once you connect up all the cables...they come out of all sides, so you'll want to figure out a way to hide this and use the soft keys on the keyboard.Works, sometimes won't wake up a PC correctly (may be the PC's fault), cable mess that prevents you from having free access to the buttons on top (you'll want to hide the box). Inexpensive."
4,"Worked like a charm, only one issue.","I'm currently running a WinXP system and an Ubuntu system. Everything hooked up without any issues. I've only had one operating problem and it's the keyboard-based command (Scroll Lock x 2) doesn't work on the Linux side. It switches fine on the WinXP side but when I switch to the Linux side then back to the WinXP side, the Scroll Lock stays on. Not a bad issue but I have to have the switch at easy access to press the buttons. With all the cables coming out of it, it looks a little unsightly on the desk."
5,A Good Switch,"This little device works well. My 2 computers are: (1) Laptop running Windows XP, and (2) Desktop dual boot with Windows Vista and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. I use screen resolution of 1280 x 1024 on all the systems; the switch works fine with all. Two minor hiccups: (1) the Linux system at first wanted to drop back to 800x600, but that was resolved when I logged out and back in the first time. (2) Did not work with my old mouse, but worked great after I upgraded to a newer one. I'm very happy with it."
4,"works great, but can act flakey with Vista 64bit","Super easy to set up. It came with all of the cables. Just plug everything in, and it works! You toggle between two computers by hitting the Scroll Lock key two times. One of the computers I hooked up runs Vista 64 bit. The other was XP Home. These boxes usually don't care about that sort of thing. I highly recommend this to someone who has two computers, but doesn't want to have two monitors, keyboards and mice. Oh, the keyboard and mouse are USB."
2,Does not work very well.,"It simply doesn't work. The majority of the time I use it, windows will say ""USB Device has malfunctioned"". If I switch back and fourth enough times it eventually goes through, but it is incredibly annoying.You should probably get a hardware switch, instead of a software switch like this."
5,Great Switch,"1st of all I would like to add that I am not using the video portion of the switch. As my monitor has two inputs for DVI, all I wanted was the USB without the DVI cost.I have a DELL laptop in a docking station on one end, and my home built pc on the other. Both work very well with the touch button on the unit. I couldn't have asked for a cheaper solution to having two keyboards and two mice on my desk. Great product."
2,OK. but is USB 1.1 .. little disappointed,"I use is with my PC and MAC. i think is good for PC with USB 1.1 but mac not really.. sometimes it die on me .. don't know the reason why,, may be it doesn't work for MAC.."
5,A great KVM switch,"A great little KVM switch for home use. If you have only two computers and you want use just one set of keyboard and mouse, this is a very handy piece of hardware. Operation is really simple - just hit the scroll key twice to switch between the machines. Setup was really easy and all the cables were included."
4,TRENDnet 4-port USB KVM,"This product came with all the cables and was very easy to setup and works very well. My only complaint is the port/cable locations on this device. It is on all four sides (front, sides, and back) of this device which causes you to be unable to hide the cables. However, the price that this device is sold at I think makes up for its short comings."
2,Too many problems,"I liked this switch at first, but I am having too much trouble with it now. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the keyboard will stop working. Whenever I switch between units my other USB devices (mouse, gamepad) are not found. I usually have to log out and back in to get this working. Sometimes I have to reboot both computers. Sometimes I have to disconnect the cables from the switch to get everything working again. One computer is Vista, the other is XP. I could not find a solution for this on the Internet. I'm going to look for something else."
2,Less than impressed,"This is a very basic KVM. While it took care of switching between by two PC's, for some reason the monitor settings of the first PC are retained each time I turn them on. This doesn't happen if I hook up a powered KVM so it isn't an issue with the monitor or PC settings. Also, the location of the various plugs on the unit makes for a very messy workspace - cords going all different directions. I won't buy another..."
4,KVM Switch,The switch works very well. It was easy to install once I decided where to put it. Cable length was a limiting factor. The only problem is that it switches back on its own sometimes.
3,Mine broke after 1 year of use,KVM died after about a year of using. They're allright but would recommend Linksys KVMs over these.
2,Where is the power?,"I have two issues with this device that I outline below. They are things I have learned to work around but would rather not. I have the KVM plugged into two PCs. The first is a desktop PC running Windows XP. The 2nd is a laptop running Linux.1) when the active PC is turned off the KVM has no power, there is no way to switch to the PC with power. The keyboard and mouse should stay powered up and allow switching to the other PC like every other KVM I have ever used. It doesn't.2) When switching I use the keyboard shortcut because the KVM is behind my desk. I hit scroll-lock multiple times in Linux and eventually figured out that I have to hit the key combination scl-lck scl-lck num-lck num-lck before it will switch back to the windows PC. From windows to Linux it works fine with scl-lck scl-lck.I have almost tired of this product. The video looks nice and the keyboard and mouse haven't had issues just the functionality that I can't stand."
3,"An excellent book, a great starting point","Even though this book is older (published in 1964!) it's an excellent source for what kendo actually ""is."" It has basic coverage of techniques and actual tournament play and practice, and has very good coverage on etiquette and philosophy (in fact, unmatched coverage of these), but lacks in many other areas (such as kendo kata, and a good description of zanshin). This was my first kendo book (and in fact the only one available at the time) and I found it an excellent starting point (and very interesting reading) but as far as a reference goes, Kendo: The Definitive Guide is much more up to date and comprehensive. That's not to say that this book shouldn't be in your library; I still believe that this should be the first book ANY aspiring or established kendoist owns."
1,Will not fit the 2006 Yamaha F-150,"Everything in this kit will fit your Yamaha F-150, BUT THE IMPELLER. Bought this aftermarket kit for $49.06 here on Amazon and during the replacement found that the impeller did not fit properly (brass hub instead of rubber. So repacked the kit and returned for refund to Amazon (they are really great about returns) but had to go to the local boat supplier and purchase the OEM kit for $64 not including gas and time to get there.I did find however that these OEM kits can be found on Ebay for $42 which includes shipping, on the other hand Amazon had it for $57.45, but with a $5.99 shipping cost you will be out $63.44."
1,read the novel instead...,"'tis a screenplay based on the novel but translated into a conventional (americanised) English thus lost most of the power from Welsh' native brogue. points of interest in this miramaxbooks dud: a) b&w photos from the famous movie, b) complete cast, crew and soundtrack info and c)a shorter interview w Irvine Welsh himself."
3,"interesting, intriquing, dissapointing ending","I looked forward to reading this book. It was interesting and intriquing, but it left me wanting more. I found the ending abrupt and dissapointing, like maybe the author had a deadline to meet and had to get it done...it was like one of those movies where you have to wait for the sequel in order to get the full understanding, clarify things and answer unaddressed questions...and then the sequel never gets made. While I realize that this book was written a long time ago...I would like to see the author go into his drawer and pull out his manuscript and finish the rest of the book...seemed to me that there was a lot more about the story to tell."
5,"Fabulous, Fun Read","The Engaging Leader is an intelligent and creative alternative to the masses of MBA style leadership tombs that we have all encountered.Its focus is on two principal leadership types and the best approaches to refining these within an organizational context, filled with an always unique and diverse audience of employees.

You will impress your friends with the knowledge and insights gathered from these passages.Read on!"
1,"Very thin -- a fact sheet, not a biography","Very thin. If this were a Wikipedia entry, available for free, you would think it needed rounding out. While described as four pages, it delivers two. It lists her books and offers excerpts from Publishers Weekly reviews, but no commentary on books published after 1999, although it says it was composed in 2006 and released on Amazon in December of 2007. It seems to be accurate in what it says, but this fact sheet is certainly not a biography and certainly not worth $9.95."
5,Excellent,"This review was written for the Magellan Meridian Swivel Mount Bracket not the Magellan Swivel Mounting Bracket 701258. Use the Magellan Meridian Swivel Mount Bracket for the Magellan Meridian COLOR GPS.Got this Magellan Swivel Mount to use as a desktop cradle for my Meridian Color and it works perfectly.The Power/Data cable connects onto the mount from the back and automatically connects to the GPSR when the receiver is snapped into place. You'll appreciate this after a few tries at attaching the connector by using it's teeny-tiny anchor screw.Construction of the mount is sturdy and holds the receiver and connector securely. The mount is adjustable so that the GPSR screen is always in your line of sight either at eye level or from above (mounted on a horizontal surface) of from below (mounted on a wall). You will, however, have to provide your own Velcro or mounting screws since none comes with the unit.Overall, terrific functionality for just a few extra dollars."
5,Works Well,I use this in my Ford Escort station wagon. The other reviews are accurate and describe it in detail so I just wanted to add another endorsement of it. It is true that it doesn't have a suction cup mount but a suction cup probably wouldn't attach well to the top of instrument panel anyway. If you are buying a new GPS receiver for your car you should get one with an integral mount so you won't need to buy a separate mount.
3,Good & bad;,"I'm now ordering my third one in three years. I use this on my boat, the first one rusted the spring out that is inside the catch release (I now spray it with silicone before and after each use). The second one shattered the plastic boss at the pivot thumbwheel adjustment point after running through some choppy conditions. I'm not impressed with it for marine usage, I understand that is probably the toughest environment I could use it in, but the product is listed for use on boats. Stainless steel hardware and reinforced mounting areas would be a good idea for marine use, however there doesn't seem to be any alternative to mount this unit on my boat, so it's either buy a different gps or keep buying these mounts."
2,item was not,The item was not as it was stated to be which was a disappointment for use in any vehicle.It does not have a suction cup mount.It must be fasten with screws.I made use of in one car.Do to not being sent what I ordered AS listed in desrciption.Most likely not buy another product.Richard
4,They do what I want them to do!,"These tights are exactly what they are supposed to be. I've washed them and she's danced in them half a dozen times and they have held up well..no runs or pulls. I do not know how they would be for heavy use (like someone who dances every day) which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. My daughter is a size 10 in most clothes and these fit perfectly as long as I stretch them as I'm pulling them up.My daughter doesn't like these tights because she said they make her legs itch and ""prickle"" when she's dancing and getting hot, but that is my daughter and not the product. I mention this in case you have a child who has sensitive skin, or suffers from skin rashes like eczema. They may not like the feel of these as they are not soft like a microfiber."
2,The Postman is much better than this Apocalyptic Sci-fi.,"A Astronaut from Outer Space returns to Post Apocalyptic planet Earth which is dominated by deserts, after a powerful Nuclear War which put an end to everything, He helps a Russian woman of a lost boat battle a Underground enemy, of a underground world which is buried deep beneath the apocalyptic planet."
5,SUPER GREAT ROMANCE!,"What can I say? I'm the author and it got GREAT REVIEWS in the media, so take my word for it. IT'S A GREAT FUN, INSPIRING, ENGAGING, LIFE- AND LOVE-AFFIRMING STORY! Buy it, read it. Great summer read, especially if you enjoy stories based on Long Island. And if you like this one, try my first book, FIRST MATE, another Long Island tale about falling in love and sailboat racing, very exciting. Hey, send me a note afterward and I'll even autograph it for you."
1,Horrible.,Not original TV sound. Studio Sound. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. It's is incredible.An awful sound for a very good video. Avoid to buy it.
1,"worthless, dangerous, and not for obvious reason","broke within 8 seconds of being out of the bagthis sectional staff was the most disappointing thing i have ever purchased off amazon, firstly, one dowel shattered about the second time it bumped the ground, quite possibly made out of pencil wood.the second dowel was dovetailed in the center and glued together, and it took about two tugs to open the rings enough to fall apart,this item is cheaply manufactured, and absolutely not practical for any practice application, complete waste of 26 dollars,this will be the last time i choose an item based on free shipping, luckily i wasn't injured. the seller should be ashamed of themselves"
4,What a deal for the price,"This was a great buy. You don't find many items like this often. It was a great price for the product. The item functions as expected. Shipping came on time, and it was well packaged."
1,Easily the worst phone I have ever owned,"Poor range: you have to be next to the base for it to work acceptably and even then it's not that great, extremely poor sound quality: it sounds like a tin can, it crackles, it pops, you name it, all the unwanted sounds are there. The phone is basically unusable. Do not waste any time or money on it. It's a piece of junk."
2,Still Searching,"I bought this phone after looking at Comsumer Reports ratings and opinions on Amazon as well as other sites. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well for me as it did for other users. I get constant interference and clicking noises, even when I try switching channels. The cordless I had before had a terrible battery life (the battery life on this phone is excellent, btw, which is part of why I gave it two stars), but my old phone rarely got interference unless the microwave was running. It also seems to be causing a lot more interference on our baby monitor than our old cordless. I've read a lot of good things about Uniden, so I'm planning on returning this one to try another model."
3,Solid bumper pads,"I used these pads to cushion the sound of my cabinet doors shutting. Some of the original bumpers had fallen off so I replaced them with these. The are very solid and do not give at all. This results in a significant noise being generated upon closure of the door. Still better than nothing at all, but I wish they were a little softer."
1,A Nightmare-DO NOT BUY!!!,"I replaced my kitchen cabinets 7 years ago with very high end cabinets. The cabinets came with these bumpers, and I was given an additional pack of these. The name ""3M Bumpon"" is on the back of the spare buttons, some of which I used. They seemed very nice, but I noticed several months back that they were turning sticky and the doors were sticking shut. I have spent several hours a day for 5 days now removing the old buttons. The only product that would remove the old adhesive is naptha, which makes me very sick. The old bumpers are also acidic and have eaten into some of the finish. By the time I am through replacing the old bumpers, I will have wasted a day and a half of my life, at least. Screw 3M! Buy a different product."
3,Did not quiet down my cabinets,"I bought these to put on my kitchen cabinet doors hoping it would quiet them down some upon shutting them, but it really didn't reduce the sound at all."
5,sticks well,"there isn't much to say about this sort of product other than it fulfills the need (bumper feet on laptop), they stuck well and haven't fallen off yet, so that is good"
5,exactly as expected,Just the size i was looking for. I had new cabinet doors with a very small overlap over the cabinet face (about 4mm average overlap and these fit perfectly.
1,Stupid Pricing,"How can the Kindle version possibly cost more than the hardcopy?! The Kindle edition has no printing, ink, paper, binding, transport costs. This defeats the whole purpose of digital books. Amazon, are you people taking crazy pills???"
3,Editing Errors,"It's hard to express how Emerson's essays have helped me through the years. I bought this particular release so I would have a copy that was easier to move from place to place with me. As I have read through various parts I continue to encounter editing errors, which are very aggravating. So just a word of warning, this may not be the best version to purchase. Luckily there are lots of other options out there."
3,Bathroom accessories,"The Kohler Forte towel ring was delivered promptly and with free shipping. Would have liked to know that the ring is stationery, that is, does not swing up and down as many other towel rings do."
5,Great Item,"I was very happy with my purchase of the Kohler Towel ring. It is made well and just as described, like all of the Kohler products I have purchased. It installed easily and is very sturdy. It does not swivel back and forth when you wipe your hands, like some I have had and I wasn't sure if I liked that at first but now I think I perfer it since I have been using it for a few weeks. The only negative is the price but as they say you get what you pay for and this was worth it."
2,"Disappointed, Stationary Ring","Installed 2 of these rings when the master bath was remodeled two years ago. I like the Forte appearance and the device is substantial in construction. However, the ring which holds the towel is fixed in place rather than hinged; therefore no movement. That makes it difficult to place or remove the towel. Very inconvenient and one is reminded every time the towel is used. The other items in the Kohler Forte line are satisfactory (the single handle sink faucet) or outstanding (all of the others that we have)."
2,Set screw design is very poor,"This is an attractive ring. After having ours for >1 year, we would definitely not purchase it again. The hex-wrench set-screw that holds the ring onto the wall attachment is a poor design that easily comes loose and falls off."
1,The Nightrunners,"While Lansdale's early thriller work, ""Cold in July"", ""Waltz of Shadows"", are highly recommended despite flaws one would expect from earlier works of a tremendously gifted writer, Lansdale horror works so far leave me cold. Like his ""Dead in the West"", the humor, humanity and accessibility of his characters in his thrillers that sets them apart as unique, isn't present with these works."
3,Warsaw Requiem,"I totally got absorbed in this book....trying to imagine what it would have been like living in the Jewish sector of Warsaw, waking up to bombs dropping and fighter planes zeroing in on children going to school!This is one book in a series of 9, called the Zion Covenant. I am on Book #8 and my husband is a book behind me. We cannot quit reading them! A wonderful series on Jews, many Christians, trying to get away from Hitler in WW2. Your faith in the power of prayer is totally reinforced in these books. You see God's hand throughout...."
2,Good book but poorly formatted for kindle.,"I enjoyed this book from the content point of view, however I'm more concerned with the quality of the transfer of the book to kindle.Unfortunately there were so many errors in the kindle version of this book. There were errors every few pages. Either spelling errors, or errors where the sentence would not make sense at all. It made the reading experience rather unpleasant. I asked Kindle for a corrected version or a refund. They chose the latter option so I'm not sure when the kindle version will be corrected."
3,Kindle Edition Riddled with Typos,"I don't find this book (Warsaw Requiem) quite as compelling as the ones that preceded it in the series, but would have given it four stars except the Kindle edition is riddled with typos. Every couple of pages you read a sentence that doesn't make sense, and then you re-read it and discover, oh, it's supposed to be BED, not BET, etc. A bit frustrating. Don't know if it was scanned from the book and if it has the same number of typos or if it is just the kindle edition. For the amount of money Kindle editions cost, I expect better quality. Other than that I am enjoying this series very much."
5,Warsaw Requiem,"I am thoroughly enjoying this whole series by the Thoene's. It keeps me interested and I can't put the book down until I have finished it - usually over a period of days. I enjoy historical novels especially with a Christian background. The suspense of what the Nazi's will do next, the close escape of the heroes and heroines keep me glued to the pages. The authors catchy theme of their books is ""Truth Through Fiction"" - it's very true."
1,NOT RECEIVED,"Saddly, my order was never received. However, I appreciate that the sender did refund the purchase cost after the 21 day allowance for delivery."
2,"Great Author, execellent information, Poorly Edited","Having read over 20 Bonsai books, I love the layout and the flow of information in this book. Specially the case studies, very useful and informative. I would recommend this for Beginner to Intermediate Bonsai enthusiast. The author is very knowledgeable and the pictures are beautiful. I would have given this book 4.5 stars, instead of 2 stars if not for the poorly editing/publishing job. There were some unacceptable editing and printing errors. For example, page 94 and 95have the exact same content(word by word) but different page layout. Hope the editors/publishers can fix these embarrasing problems."
4,Sexy Platform,"These are excellent shoes, well made, true to size, and sexy. However, I ordered a pair in Ivory and when I opened the box, the color was not Ivory. It looked more like pale pinkish-beige. Had they been ivory or even champagne I would have kept them but, it wasn't close enough."
1,You know what I like in a cookbook? RECIPES.,"This cookbook was something of a waste--glad I got it used. The used copy I got still had the Pottery Barn sticker on the back, which comes as no surprise--I don't think that the author of this book intended to have it actually serve as a guide to cooking with a grill pan. Rather, it's a glossy throwaway publication that would look great tucked in to a gift box along with a new grill pan.This book is full of photos...and big chapter headers...and white space...but very few actual recipes. Also, there's nothing really ""grill pan specific"" about them; it's really more of a ""barbeque substitute"" sort of thing. Nor is it a guide to one-pot cooking with a grill pan, which is sort of what I was hoping for. I really don't see myself making much of what's listed in this cookbook; if I wanted to get a million other pots and pans dirty I wouldn't bother hauling out the grill pan."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"Some interesting recipes, but none for plain old steak! Had to resort to Betty Crocker for an easy, ""just grill-me"" stove-top steak!"
3,Not What I Expected,"I give this cookbook high marks for design; the crisp photos, common-sense page setup and helpful tips combined to make it very user friendly.The recipes were less impressive. I had expected most of the book would be main course options, but instead it was heavy on vegetables, salads and sides with only maybe a quarter of the book being meat based centerpieces of a meal. That's not inherently bad, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I also found that many of these recipes are things I already have: eggplant parm, sausage & peppers, bruschetta, fajitas. Maybe a using a grill pan will revolutionize them, but I'd been hoping for things not already in my repertoire.All in all, it's a nice book. Just not for me."
2,so far not very good,"I have made two or three things out of this book and don' find it helpful. The asparagus for example LOOKS great in the picture but was dried out and stringy after being ""grilled."" Better in water, steam, or anything else!"
2,Poor,"This book have few nice recipes but overall it is waste of money. Soft cover, poor recipes explanation. 2 out of 5."
3,Millstones,"As I read the book I thought about the rich young ruler who thought he was leading a good life. Christ asked him to give up his riches. He couldn't or wouldn't and the suggested outcome was not eternal life. I believe Scripture plainly states that one cannot be a practicing homosexual and obtain eternal life. This book wants one to believe otherwise. There was an excerpt where she told of a father who removed his children from the church where homosexuality was condoned. She saw that as a weakness on his part. I thought of the passage about millstones around the neck of those who would lead children astray. Everyone should be welcome in Lutheran Churches because we are all sinners and need salvation. However, we must remember that Christ welcomed sinners who realized that is what they were. He always said, ""Your faith has made you well. GO AND SIN NO MORE."" No excuses."
1,AVOID!!!,We ordered computer RAM. We got video screens! We returned the screens. We got MORE screens. Draw your own conclusions and act accordingly...
5,Best ELO album since New World Record !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read the Amazon's review section regulary, but I write to it only in special ocasion.I am writing this because Alpacas Orgling is the best album I bought in two years.The songwriting is very good, and the arrangements are superb. The songs are very similar to ELO, and I liked it better than the great ELO return, Zoom.Buy this album!!!!! You will like it very much."
4,L.E.O.--Alpacas Orgling,"How does this lineup sound to you? Bleu, Andy Sturmer (Jellyfish), Mike Viola (The Candy Butchers), Jason Scheff (Chicago), Steve Gorman (The Black Crowes), Matt Mahaffey (Self), John Fields, Tony Goddess (pApAs fritAs), Hanson, Eric Barao (The Cautions), Scott Simons (The Argument)...yeah, I thought so. Fans of Electric Light Orchestra will absolutely love this, but it has so much more to offer. Everyone of the songs on Alpacas Orgling melds the talents of the popsters above into sweet tributes to Jeff Lynne and the contributions he made to the Power Pop genre. But take note, this release is loaded with originals not remakes. This is special music that will excite, soothe and satisfy lovers of Pop music everywhere."
3,Rip-off of a classic band,"What do you get when you rearrange the letters E.L.O.? L.E.O.?This album isn't so much as a tribute (or ""homage"") to E.L.O. or Jeff Lynne or even the Traveling Wilburys, as a calculated rip-off.You can just hear ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"" or ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"" redone as some other song. Hell, there is even a cover of ""Don't Bring Me Down"". Some songs are down right cringe inducing.The way I break it down is: 1 star for ""Private Line"", another star for ""Goodbye Innocence"", and 1 star for the reclusive Andy Sturmer.Save your money and skip it. Stick to the real deal, and listen to the original ELO albums."
2,it's ooookay,"the AMG guy has some issue with jellyfish. when he said this album was better than the work of the ""overrated"" jellyfish, ouch! this is okay, but I don't think I would say this is better than spilt milk, which will stay atop the perfect power pop hill till other albums come and knock it off of that perch, which I don't know if I see happening, as they had influences and an understanding of pop that the newer power pop groups don't seem to have. other groups only seem to be coming at things from just one angle, while jellyfish's best work had shades of many great bands, along with songwriting and chord changes that still make musicians jealous and fans longingly think of them, even if they're not listening to their stuff, which is the sign of a great band. this is just a tribute at it's core, and it's one angle, while spilt milk had many moods to enjoy. so amg guy is wrong big time"
4,otfkthx 2641970845,"i only bought this record (by a band who seem to be scared of capital letters, hence the complete lack of them in this review) because they were on the same label (fantastic plastic) as ikara colt, i'd never even heard a second of their music before buying the album, but it certainly didn't disappoint. only about 25 minutes long, but you don't realise without checking, and certainly don't feel short changed. the sound is chaotic but appealing, the two singers' voices grating against each other slightly. at times there's less singing and more yelling, even (especially?) from the first track, fermez la bouche, which really sets the tone. either 'my own private disco' or 'what would morrisey say' is the stand-out track, both fantastic. 'apples' closes the album, and is the slowest track of the lot, though still quicker than you'd ever get from most bands.i'd recommend anybody to try this, although probably try before you buy, as it's a sound that you'd either love or hate."
5,turquoise&sterling silver inlaid band ring,"I am very pleased with the ring. It was a gift to my husband and he loved it!! It was so easy to purchase and it arrived in plenty of time.Thank you!Sincerely,Lois Garbarini"
3,The answering system brought down the value!,"This telephone has excellent clarity. It's a handsome model. It has excellent features that are user friendly. The problem is the answering system. What a disappointment. It is full of static that even makes the outgoing message sound horrible. So, if the answering system is one of the most important features you are looking for, I would not buy this brand. I know Uniden is aware of the problem and hope the work on it soon."
1,Battery life is TERRIBLE!,"Please reconsider pruchasing this phone. Uniden phones use NICKEL-CADMIUM (Ni-Cad) batteries. Under typical use, after 3-4 months, I would be surprised if you got more then 1 hour of use out of it. They develop a terrible memory problem if you are not obsessive-compulsive about using the battery to the fullest before placing it back on the charger/cradle. So, under normal, typical use, this phone's performance (or any Uniden cordless phone, for that matter) in under 4 months will be very upseting. I will never buy another phone that uses Ni-Cad batteries. EVER!"
3,Where can I get a battery?,Here is a problem. I have this phone. I cannot find a new battery for the darn thing! What am I supposed to do now?
4,This is a GREAT phone for the money!,"This really a great phone! I have had it about a month now and it is terrific! Has great clarity, range, and ease of use. The answering machine and caller ID work great...no complaints whatsoever! The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating was it isn't offered in white, which would have gone better with our decor."
3,"good price, not so great battery or range","i've had this phone for about two years. the reception has been fine, provided you don't go too far away. in my old apartment, i didn't have any problems with it. in the house i live in now, i'm ok in the house, but the second i step outside, in comes the static.i could live with that, it's not the greatest, but for having spent only about 80 bucks, i could deal with it -- try finding another cordless with digital answering machine and caller id for the same amount.now, though, if the phone's off the base for more than a couple of hours, the battery dies, inevitably after you've been waiting on hold for something, right after you get connected. i'm debating getting a new battery, or a new phone...."
4,"Good features, bad answering machine",Its a pretty good phone for the price but the playback of messages are very poor and hard to understand. Reception is decent.
3,Bad Service,"I purchased this phone because of the great reviews. I should have listened to the review that informed me it was a great phone, when it worked. I had this phone for 2 weeks when the handset completely died. Calling the company for help was very frustrating because they transfered me from dept. to dept. and put me on hold each time for a significant amount of time. And then didn't help me at all. I finally took the phone back to the store. I will probably never buy another Uniden product. It has great features, but what good are they if the phone doesn't work."
5,"Great phone, fantastic price","I was looking to replace a cordless phone with caller id and a seperate old answering machine - this unit has the best of both. It took me a few days to get used to the caller id display - the text on it is quite smaller than on my previous unit and most other displays, however the smaller text allows for the entire date/time, full name and number to all be displayed at once, a very nice feature. Sound quality on the phone is excellent, no breaking up. The answering machine seems to work great too, lots of options and featres only found on more expensive models. A sure bet for a great caller id cordless with answering machine."
1,Handset problems are true!,"We bought this phone a couple of months ago. The handset no longer holds a charge, and constantly complains if it's not put back on the base immediately after each use. You cannot check the messages on the answering machine when you are actually using the handset on a call, either. The caller ID funtion is counterintuitive. We hoped this phone would work for all our needs, but it has proven only to frustrate the entire family. We do not reccomend this phone, or others by Uniden."
4,Pretty well satisfied. Wish it had handset speakerphone.,"I've had this phone for about a week now and am more or less pleased with it. It has a lot of great features for the price. My only wish is that the handset had a speakerphone (my old Uniden phone did). I can't seem to access the speaker phone while the handset is sitting in the base either. Other than that, it's well worth the price."
2,Good Price - Hope you like to yell,"We bought this phone only because it was the cheapest with Caller ID and an answering machine together. We were constantly hearing complaints from people we were talking to that we did not sound loud enough. The sound on our end was just as bad! If you like to yell this phone if for you...If not, look for something better."
4,Nice but...,"I like this item overall but, if you use the telephone w/out a headset, it's not very comfortable on your ear. Otherwise, I'm happy w/ the answering machine, etc."
1,Can I give it Negative Stars?,"1 Star for this movie is way too generous. If you are considering watching this, remove all sharp objects from your home. I thought I had watched bad movies/acting before. This one has topped the chart. Highly disappointed in the cast of this film. How bad can it be you may ask? It is an experience in itself. All of the Actors appear to be trying to out act(epic failures all around) each other over a script (if that's what you call it) that would seem to be almost all improv. Very sad... very sad excuse for entertainment. Defies any near definition of entertainment. Save your time. Pass on this movie. IMO"
1,DID NOT ORDER LAST HOUR,This item (DVD - The Last HOur) showed up on my preview list but I DID NOT ever order and should not have been charged for this item. Please review your records to make certain that this item WAS NOT CHARGED to my account as I did not order nor have I received.Terri Cloyd
4,female torx sockets,This is a very good quality steel product with a utilitarian finish. I would buy from this company again. Delivery was prompt and as I live in Alaska means that they shipped quickly.
3,Overview of Scottish Rite Degrees,This book provides a brief overview of the teachings of each of the Scottish Rite degrees. I found it very interesting and provides added value to my Masonic library.
3,The characters were a stretch,"I really didn't believe that Kristy would act that obnoxious...a lot of the things the characters did were out of character. The author bent them to fit the story. Also, Claudia got furious at Stacey for having the party and inviting her (""putting her in the middle""), but Claudia is the one that chose to go...it's on her head, if you ask me. So, it was a bit annoying, but we still thought the book was OK...so 3 stars."
4,Wow,"I couldn't believe this one, but I would feel exactly like Stacey does. Excellent job, Ann. You showed how the BSC isn't everything."
3,Format Warning,"This is not a region 1 DVD. It is a region 9, which is supposed to be all formats (huh?) However, it doesn't work on my region 1 player, but does work on my laptop without changing region. Could be my dvd player, which is kind of old, but heads up."
1,A complete disappointment.,After waiting many years for this DVD to be released in US format I received it to find that it would only play in black and white and there was no option for the english language version I saw in the theater and have on VHS. In addition subtitles drop off the bottom of the screen and even the black and white picture is very poor. All and all a coplete disappointment. I'll wait for Criterion to release a version. Steer clear of this version.
1,Casanova,"I ordered the Casanova DVDs in early June for Father's Day. I had tried to find it for years at Blockbuster, Netflixs, online, etc. We were very disappointed when the DVD's I finally found didn't work on our DVD player. I sent an email to the seller and to Amazon and have yet to get a response. It must be recorded for a European player. Please advise!!My husband saw the movie many years ago in Europe and was so happy when I surprised him with the DVD's. We sat down for a fun evening, popcorn and all, and talk about a major disappointment...my gift turned into a real downer. I gave it one star because the picture on the cover is nice."
4,"Not a lot to say, but...",This carrying case is well-made and quite durable - it fits on a belt properly too. The one rather strange thing about it is that it seems a little big for the unit it is intended for. It could have been made smaller and still fitted the Meiridan GPS with room to spare. It's also a bit expensive for what you get.
3,canvas cass for early model gps,this was a suitable case for an early model magellan gps. both are sitting on the shelf since new technology makes this of little interest
3,M*A*S*H T-Shirt,"The material and fit of this t-shirt is fine, but it is a much lighter green than I had expected. This shade of green is not true to the show at all."
3,Fair and balanced,"First let me say the rationale for grouping these diverse literary essays is misleading; despite contrary claims on the book jacket, not all of the authors included led blemished lives. It probably seemed as good editorial justification for compiling these literary biographical essays as any, as they were clearly written for very different purposes over the years.But getting beyond that minor critique, the collection is uniformly entertaining, informative and well-written. Allen is an opinionated and witty critic, and is not shy about taking on others in the field (e.g. Joyce Carol Oates in one essay). And while this book may act as a pleasant intro to the authors discussed, it rarely scales the heights of either profundity or dazzling insight which someone like James Wood can provide. Anyone superficially familiar with many of these writers will find themselves trodding familiar ground. For the novice, however, they are a very good place to start."
5,This is one of the BESt CD's I've ever purchased!!!,The Kry is one of my favorite bands! They are even better LIVE!! All 4 of their albums are excellent!
1,Ibhave not received,I still have notbreceived this book. Thus no review. Am disappointed as I do not know how to get it.
1,"There's no oil in the world, since 1992.","This book was a best-seller, when it was published, more than thirty years ago.I tried to read this trash-book, about twenty years ago.This book was writen in 1972 and is full of ""scientific"" prophecies.Among theses ""scientific prophecies"" is that until 1992, there won't be no oil, in all the world.In fact all the ""scientific prophecies"" on this trash-book were wrong.The ""experts"" that wrote this book were all wrong.The ""future world"" described in this trash-book is so real, as the book ""The wizard of Oz"".Today books in this same style are again best-sellers.And such as this book, they are wrong again.Human foolishness is eternal and the today sucess of this kind of trash-book shows this fact."
3,Not the best ski racing book I have ever read,this book is OK but not any new ideas or plans - Pretty much repeating all the same information though the whole book - did find a couple of worthwhile ideas but as a whole not that interesting -
5,OH MY GOSH!!!!,"This record has the most beautiful song by lou Reed (Perfect Day) I love all the songs on this cd. If you like the cd, you'll love the movie, and vice verse...."
1,No trains spotted,"The only good song on this album is 'lust for life.' I thought the soundtrack was going to be pretty good, but only 'lust for life' was a good and catchy song. The songs are different from most music out there and I would only buy this album if you really liked the movie."
5,Perhaps the Best Pop Soundtrack of the Last Quarter-Century,"No exaggeration. This disc is completely and seamlessly evocative of the film from which it's derived. There's a terrific blend of Britpop, dancehall rock and bombing techno, including the immensely enjoyable 'Born Slippy'. Every song supports every other song, making the disc extremely listenable and ageless.Other factors:1. For Blur fans in the US, only opportunity to get 'Sing' on disc;2. Pulp's 'Mile End' is one of the greatest songs of Britpop, a happy melody counterpointed with extremely downtrodden lyricplay."
5,BUY IT!,"A very, very nice change from the norm. Some songs make you want to dance or jump up and down but others are really relaxing. Great mix."
3,thoughts,good book that provides an interesting snap shot of the late 90s. Drags a bit in the third quarter and never quite rebounds.
3,A Business Book for the Beach,"Its a pretty easy read and somewhat entertaining, but the subject matter lacks the depth necessary for a good business book. The overall story is that of an immature and flawed company with no lasting value in a hot sector, AOL, which merges with an established but eccentric blue chip media company,Time Warner. What makes this merger possible is Wall Street's misguided opinion of the long term value of AOL, and the misjudgement and agressiveness of an aging and personally stressed CEO.To much of the book is spend examining the mind and personality of AOL's Steve Case. This would be similar to dedicating a significant amount of a cook book to describing the culinary delights of a rice cake.A good beach read. You will not grow as a human being or business person by reading this book though."
3,OK,"Looks great, size is accurate(medium has enough room for my husky to turn around easily), and it was really easy to put together. However, I am worried about the build quality--it is very thin wood held together with a combination of bolts, screws, and staples. For something that is going to be left outside year-round (and likely chewed on) it seems a bit flimsy. I'll update in a month or two."
3,Not really large.,I paid way too much for a dog house that was way too small. It says large but may be large for a small dog but way too small for a Great Dane.
2,Floor grid falls out and breaks,"We bought two of these for our two dogs last Christmas (2011). They arrived on time, packed well and were simple enough to put together. After 6 months with them we have finally used a solid piece of MDF board cut to size for the floor. The grid it comes with did not fit snug enough and was tipped out and fell to the ground each week or so. There is not enough of a lip inside the house to screw the floor grid down either. Eventually, after resetting the grid each each week, one dog must've stepped on the grid just right when it was crooked to the ground and the wood snapped. We attempted replacing with cut garden trellis and concrete boards. Nothing would fit the tiny lip. So we bought large MDF board from Home Depot and cut out the corners to fit. No problems now. They have soft cushions on the new base and the walls and roof are still solid and waterproof."
4,Call of the Dolphins by Lana Miller,"This is a good read, especially toward the middle and later chapters. The appeal is for someone who wishes to understand the plight of the dolphins today and especially what their relationship is to people. She swims with them, listens to them with intuitive understanding, and communicates with them.The journey to follow the dolphin's ""call"" is apparently cathartic for the author who lets us in on some personal self-discovery. The book is also a compilation of stories others related to her about their dolphin encounters. Along with the metaphysical inferences, there is scientific documentation, and classical references"
3,"Golden, Salvatore both strengths in anthology","Very engaging new fantasy world, with tribes of humans locked in generations of combat with lizard-like beings. The best stories in this anthology, written by many Forgotten Realms veterans, focus on the complicated relationships between the humans and the saurans. They have more in common that each race thinks, of course. Once again, Salvatore's story, the keystone of the book, is very entertaining, along with Golden's exploration of sauran identity in ""The Ultimate Weapon."" The other stories, sadly, leave little lasting impact, although they are worth reading to pass the time."
3,Short stories by early Herbert,"This is a collection of eight short stories originally published from 1961 to 1967, so essentially pre-Dune. By today's standards these stories are rather slow and convoluted, but not bad, with some rather alien aliens. The story on women in military uniform actually looks rather modern (instead of forty years old: some things never go out of date!).This book will probably be liked by those who liked ""Whipping star"". Better than ""The Godmakers""."
4,Best read after the visit,I read this book after I had returned from the Sudan. I do wish I had read it before I went to there. A good read fully appreciated after moving in that region. Look at my pictures from my visit at http://www.compmat.wcape.school.za/PHS/SudanGoing/index.htm
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is undoubtably the worst rifle ever made. Sadly many people opt for this rifle due to its small price tag. All I can say is, ""you get what you pay for."" This is a perfect example of it. You CANNOT upgrade it. It is inconsistent, has no accessories, you must pracitally destory your sight assembly to fit a scope on it. The maximum range is about 15-20 yards aiming at a mansized target. Do not be fooled by most advertisements, this rifle shoots rounghly 200 FPS. Worst of all, it WILL break within a few months and become just another expensive doorstopper. My advice, save your money and buy something better."
3,i dont believe this guy,"okay i dont own the gun or anything but this guy needs to understand something , airsoft is a sport like any other(but way more fun) people are obsessed with all types of sports and for you to judge people enjoying life by calling them a joke, thats not right so you can just shutup."
2,No,I do not like this gun I have had it a good little while and now 1/2 the time it doesn't even shoot and another 1/4 of the time it sucks at shooting. You can probably fine much better guns for this price & shipping. So I don't recommend it.
4,Best Airsoft I have bought,"More fun than I bargained for, love the mock shells. This would be a five except for the front sight is not stationary, and has to be adjusted."
1,DON'T BUY FROM AIRSPLAT!!!!,WARNING READ FIRST!!!Airsplat is not the company to but from. This company is known for sending broken gun or completely the wrong gun to your address. I haved ordered from them and received a broken gun. When you try to get another one they make you pay for another and make YOU pay to return that one. AIRSPlAT is a joke DON'T by from them!!!!!
3,Get the Clear Version,"The gun is 'ok' we've had problems with jamming, but for the price, I guess it's expected.They can look realistic which is a concern - I suggest the clear v. the black."
3,pretty good,i got the super 9 today and did a little shootingthe shells are pretty good and fire fairly accurately... the hi cap mag and the adapter suck though if a round is even chambered it will literally shoot it about 3 feet... its pretty light thoughthe shells are a pain trying to find in forests but are really durable.cant wait to post a review after battle...overall the gun is about three feet long. the bolt sticks a little but thats nothin a little wd40 cant fixif ur lookin for an acceptable gun at great price buy the super 9ps if u buy extra mags dont order extra shells the mags come with them-Zpyromaniac
3,muh,i have fired this at my friends house and it is a very powerful gun but if i hadnt fired and had just held i would have called it a weightless piece of junk. It weighs like one pound. Then it somehow broke and he got a good full metal UTG sniper and it is awesome. well anyways i recommend this for beginners but dont drop it or anything because it might break but the power is good.
5,THE BEST GUN EVER,"I purchased this gun on july 15, 2010 and i still have it in mint condition. this is extremely good accuracy, i hit targets at least 200 feet away. this gun is extremely powerful. about 75 feet away, I got shot and was bleeding. This gun is durable. its about 5 pounds so its good for running. If I were you, get this gun. You will be impressed. this is a great deal, i think this gun should be $150."
5,Very nice gun!!!!!!!!!,The Super 9 is a great gun i picked a guy off with a 350 fps m16. It has more fps than they say it has. The super 9 is actualy around 400 fps. It is very acurate!!!! IT IS SICK!!!
2,disopointed,i got mine on craigslist I was excited when i got this but when i tried it out it stinks it is basically all plastic exept some parts on the gun like the barrel and the trigger and trigger gard but it feels so cheep it is good to about 40 feet and then it curves get a better sniper this is not a bad gun for a beginer but if your looking for a good sniper this is not it
3,Ship to canada? Where does it say?,Does this item ship to canada... someone... i cant find where it would say. From what i read and the reviews it would be a great gun but i dont want it stopped at the border like so many other airsoft guns have... I gave 3 stars because of info and reviews... i'll see if i will make another one with more if i get the gun.
2,Not for a serious player,"If you are at all serious about Airsoft, then don't buy this. This gun will not last very long. It is almost impossible to hit anything even when you are using high grade BB's because of the BB curves up after about fifty feet."
2,All I'm saying...,"I like airsoft, but spending 100s mabey thousands of dollars on a fake gun is a little much. So shut your mouth. And.....""hardcore""...airsoft is a lot more than any other sports. In other sports,you pay mabey 5 bucks on a ball. Not a 1000 dollars. In conclusion,airsoft is fun...but ""hardcore airsofters""(hah..what a joke) are insane.(unless your some spoiled kid.) Anyway...don't buy this gun. I'm not going to go into detail...so i'm just going to say overall its not worth it."
4,Awesome gun.,This gun is the bomb. Get it now and you will be happy for the rest of your life. Yes it is bolt action and shoots hard. It can shoot 100-125 ft and could kill anyone from far away. Get it now...
4,Great for Wacom Tablet!,I bought this for my Wacom Intuos3 6 x 8 Pen Tablet to keep it safe in transit in my laptop bag. It fits perfectly! Of course the mouse and pen don't fit inside but I store them in a compartment in my laptop bag.
4,Pretty good for the price,"Well almost a year later I guess this has done its job. For those with a standard 15.4"" screen, I would probably recommend something else. I thought it would stretch, as other reviewers had mentioned, but I ended up with small holes in the two bottom corners. It has protected the outside of the computer, but it is a struggle every day getting it in. It was inexpensive, but I still have to drop it from my original 4 stars to 3 stars.---------------------------------The major draw to this item was the price, $14.99. It is a bit tight on my Dell computer, but it serves the purpose - protecting it while it is in my backpack. I will say that after reading a previous reviewers comments on the metal bodyglove logo scrating the top of his laptop, I do place the computer in the sleeve upside down."
2,too small,I have a 15inch hp laptop and it takes me at least 5 minutes to zip this up. The case would be great if it was about 1 inch bigger all the way around. There is no way I can get papers or anything else in the case.
4,"Good price, but too small","The price is right and the construction as expected, however, my 15.4 Acer will not fit in this sleeve. The sleeve barely fits over my 15.4 Toshiba, so I will keep one, but sell the other. I would have liked a handle on the bag, but no big deal. If you have a 15"" or smaller notebook and want some added protection without the big clunky notebook bag approach, this is what you will want. I will use it inside my backpack when I carry the Toshiba. Still looking for something to fit the Acer."
2,For 10 bucks what should I expect,Well this could have been better. The sleeve needs more padding around the sides and then it would have been a better product. It is constructed on thin material and it is lacking in side impact protection. Mind you it should work well as an around the office or around the home but it pails in comparison to the timbuk2 product and the neocase that I also own.
3,"Does not fit 15.4"" Dell Inspiron 1520","I should have known better than to listen to the written reviews saying this would fit a 15.4"" laptop. 15.4"" laptops come in all different sizes. This sleeve will not adequately protect a Dell Inspiron 1520 15.4"". You can force it to zip over this laptop, but it will leave the corners of your laptop protected only by the zipper rather than the padding built into the sleeve. Even worse, the zipper is forced to directly contact the corners of your laptop and can possibly scratch it. You should always try to size a laptop sleeve at your local big-box retailer before you buy online."
3,Good,Good for a great price. Is heavy with my laptop in it. I probably should have paid extra for one with handles.
5,Laptop travel case,"Even though the sleeve doesn't fit my laptop exactly, it keeps my Macbook Pro from getting scratched or damaged."
1,shipped a wrong item,i got the wrong item shipped. i was supposed to get the RSA number from pc universe but they never bothered to follow up. will not by anything again from pc universe.
1,pissed by PC Universe,"I ordered this sleeve and 1 day later got an email from Amazon saying my order was cancelled (without reason being given), ordered again the next day and 1 day later received the same email. If you don't have it then don't put it online."
1,Metal body glove label damaged my laptop,"I liked the laptop sleeve until the metal body glove logo label on the front chipped the top of my laptop. The label is a metal logo that has 2 prongs that fit through a back piece and then fold over. Well, the prongs were not folded flat and one of them took a huge chip out of the cover of my laptop. I'm lucky I didn't have a tablet or it would have ruined the screen. And Fellowes has an extremely frustrating and complicated claims process. I do not recommend this product. I gave it 1 star because they wouldn't let me give it 0. A protective case that inflicts damage is useless."
3,Good Book for Journalism students,"Required book for class, more aimed towards journalism students. Otherwise, very good and full of good knowledge."
4,pretty good stuff here,"Not a bad little cd here. ""Sight"" stands out as a definite keeper. ""Early in the Morning"" has a nice sound too it as well. Website looking good too. Keep up the work guys. I would encourage anyone who doesnt have the cd to pick it up sometime."
3,Too rah-rah for me,"I guess this is a good overview of this work (queer performance) but having seen some of these people perform ... well, some of the work is really awful. But you'd never know that from reading Roman.Why do academics always feel like they have to be cheerleaders for anything in ""the community""?? (especially if it gets attacked by Jesse Helms).Something more balanced and yes, critical, might be in order. In a couple of years, most of this stuff is going to look as dopey as a lot of ""feminist"" performance of the 70s."
5,Recommended for emotional stability!,I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is having issues with menopausal symptoms. I tried this on a recommendation from my chiropractor and started taking it back last Fall. It took a few weeks for me to realize the bouts of depression that would come and go had gone. I felt better overall and had more energy. I am also taking low dose Premarin and will try to get off it now thatI see this is working. It does take time to build in your system and I would advise to always have a supply on hand so you don't lapse taking your daily dose.
5,"NO MORE HOT FLASHES, HOORAY!","This is the best meonpausal relief product I have tried! I have been taking it for less than a month and already my hot flashes, moodiness, and irratability are virtually gone! I am a happy camper!!!"
1,Still night sweating & hot flashing,"I've been taking Promensil Menopausal Relief Supplement for 10 weeks and I have not yet experienced any relief. I'm disappointed because after reading all the positive reviews I was hoping it would work for me. Alot of the reviewers said it worked for them quickly, some in a matter of days, for others in a week or two. I'm on my second 60 count box and I'm totally miserable. I'm averaging 10 to 15 maybe more hot flashes a day (some days I lose count if I don't write it down), and my night sweat are insane! I awake drenched in sweat, therefore, I don't get a restful nights sleep. My symptoms started two weeks before Christmas, so all of this is new to me (Jan. made it one year since my periods stopped). I'm going to finished this second box and look for something else. I can't take much more of these symptoms."
5,Great product for relief!,"I've been using ProMensil for a number of year and it has greatly reduced my problems with peri-menopausal and menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, sleeplessness, etc.). It is all-natural, so I feel much better about taking something like this than I would subjecting my body to artificial hormones (which is what a doctor would write a prescription for). From the time you start taking this product, it may take a week or two before you notice any changes, but then you ""feel like yourself"" again and it's wonderful!"
5,Great and it helps,This product is awesome it helps with pre-menopause situations to reduce them or make them not happen at al. I would recommend this to all persons who are pre-menopausal to try it
5,My hot flashes are over!,"Well, I read the other reviews, and I stuck it out for almost 60 days, one pill a day, and finally the hot flashes simply stopped. No side effects at all, just a pill each night. The hot flashes were pretty bad and were really disrupting my life. Now they're just gone! Great product!"
4,alternative to hormones,I took prescription hormones for menopause for seven years but my dr wanted me to get off of them. When I got off them I found I needed a little something to help balance my hormones. The promensil helps especially with the mood swings. I have had no problems with taking it. My dr says it is ok for me to take.
1,Save your $ don't bother with this product,I take a variety of basic vitamins and supplements. Having hot flashes -- I thought this would work according to claims......... made ZERO difference
2,New Phase is Much Better,I purchased this product for hot flashes and night sweats and it has not helped at all. I was taking New Phase and it worked immediately. I would not recommend Promensil. Try New Phase it really works.
2,Shoots up your blood pressure,"Sadly, these didn't work for me. I have a blood pressure problem and they seemed to cause it to spike."
5,Promensil supplement review,This worked as advertised. Problems associated with menopausal have decreased and are continuing to do so after 45 days. Thanks
3,Not for Me,"I had high hopes for Promensil, based on all the positive reviews, but it did not work for me.Previously, a few years ago, I had tried Remifemin, and it exacerbated the hot flashes so that I could not cool down no matter what I did, and I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin 24-7. Unfortunately, Promensil caused the exact same condition, building in intensity each day I was using it. One day after discontinuing it, the severe hot ""flashes"" ceased.Based on my experience, I would say this is a highly potent supplement.However, since it didn't do for me what it is advertised to do, I am taking 2 stars off.I would still recommend other perimenopausal or menopausal women try it to see if it helps them."
4,natural relief,"I was on an estrogen patch for eight years, and was always worried about the side effects, so I decided to try Promensil. So far it has worked pretty well for me. The only con would be that it does not really help vaginal dryness. It is also cheaper than the patch even with insurance coverage."
3,Finally .... relief!,"I had strong doubts that this product would reduce hot flashes; I've tried other things (cohash & chinese suppliments). The only thing that kept me taking this product was the instructions that said it might take 2 to 4 weeks to notice anything. So I kept taking them because.. why not? The pills are easy to swallow, no aftertaste, so, why not?This is my 28th day taking the Red Clover. Noticeably, the flashes have diminished in intensity and have become fewer. OMG! I feel so much more comfortable in my own skin, and am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled!Thank you Promensil, and thank all you ladies who wrote reviews saying it worked. Thank you so very much.10/1 UPDATE: They stopped working about a month ago. I tried double dose, nothing. Such a bummer. I bought Macalife, started that today, more importantly, I spoke to my doctor & will pick up my first HRT tablets in the morning."
3,Question,"I just got my order of two pack Promensil menopause for my mom. But I got a question about the tablet color, I remember it was dark red when I bought it about one year ago.But the two pack I received are all dark green. Is it normal? I'm kind of worried coz I need to mail this back to my country for my mom, so I need to make sure I didn't get the fake one."
5,Promensil,"This is so great! No side effects like prescriptions. No hot flashes, no pms symptoms. Will keep it up as long as needed! For life!"
4,Vastly underrated,"I don't know why this album has such a bad reputation. Yes, it's the first studio LP without Steve Albini, so it sounds different; however, it's still a really great album. The 1-2-3 punch of ""Thumper"", ""Blue Shot"", and ""Thumbscrews"" (one of my favorite TJL songs) can hold up to any other album of theirs. The rest of the album is good, with only a few songs i dont really care for, hence the 4 stars. With Goat and Liar, all of the songs kick ass. Just because theres 2 or 3 songs that are fairly mediocre, doesn't mean this should be shunned. It's way better than pretty much any other popular band of the time. Oh, and ""Skull Of A German""'s guitar line kicks my ass."
4,Polished != Bad,"Yeah, Shot is a radical departure from every single one of the various styles that tJL have affected throughout their career, as well as their major-label debut (Show doesn't count) and first attempt at recording without Albini, so I was a tad skeptical. A year and a half later though, I'm convinced; Shot is every bit as good as anything else they've ever produced, just in a different way. The clipped, oddly precise intensity of the first two songs and the abrasive torpedo that is ""Thumbscrews"" are the record's clear high points, but there's plenty of other moments of greatness to be found amid the weird range of sounds tJL experiment with here. A few songs don't quite work, but there's been a few songs that didn't quite work on almost every tJL release up to this point; don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Basically, just ignore the hipsters and buy the stupid thing; you'll probably end up liking it as much as Down, at least."
3,The Lizard is getting old fast,"I have never seen The Jesus Lizard live, which as I understand it is quite an experience, but their albums are one terrifying, brutal but equally melodic and beautiful experience. Somehow I think David Yow's has quite a talented voice, because if you can find one person who can go to different levels of blood-curdling anger, you will buy me the entire Lizard disc catalogue. ""Shot"" is a middling Lizard album, but has a few gems stuck in between."
2,the worst album by one of the greatest indie rock bands,"A lot of fans feared this was their last album, because the energy and inspiration just didn't come through on the recording. There are many good songs, but, unfortunately, there are also a few bad ones (""Trephination"" for example, which seems to go nowhere). Maybe having ""a few"" bad songs doesn't seem like a big deal, but this came from a band whose every album was a monster of sound and energy! What happened? Maybe Duane (the guitarist) has too many side projects, because his tone is weak and the playing is uninspired. If you're looking to buy your first Jesus Lizard, buy Head or Goat instead."
2,tedious,"no way, this ain't the JL we knew and loved. ""down"" really did hint at a downward spiral (just like its title and album cover) in the quality of songwriting, but had much to recommend it. this thing just completely blows, and repeated listens bear this out. really insipid and flat, utterly forgettable songs, i can't stress how disappointing this is for a JL fan from way back when. do yourself a favor and spend your $ on the the previous JL albums or the scratch acid comp instead."
5,Something for everyone,"I love this record but I just had to add to Zappaman's review because I think ""Suit of Lights"" and ""I'll wear it Proudly"" are the standout tracks on this five star cd. The latter song was chosen recently by Thom from Radiohead as a 'song that changed my life' in an interview in Q magazine. Radiohead have taken to covering it recently and I think ""Proudly"" is a direct relation to ""Fake Plasic Trees"". Anyway, ""King of America"" is worth every penny. outstanding."
5,King of America Elvis' Best,"This double CD set, which came out on RykoDisc as an early bonus edition, is surely the most recent great Elvis album not co-written with Burt Bacharach. His first real effort without the Attractions, KOA displays the country musicman at the heart of this seamless album (which is how I first heard it back in '85, I think). Only ""Jack of All Parades"" and ""I'll Wear it Proudly"" are tossable while ""Brilliant Mistake"", ""Suit of Lights"" & ""The Big Light"" are classics. Worth the extra four bucks to listen to the live stuff. The booze seems to be freely flowing that evening...."
1,Not a good experience,"I purchased these shoes to replace a pair I originally bought at Nordstrom (these were damaged and I had to have another pair). The first time I ordered , they were the correct size but they were much longer and did not fit me at all.I ordered another pair in a different color and when they arrived they did not fit properly either(too long again).I thought it would be great to order them online to get a replacement pair since I knew my size, I love the brand and never had a sizing issue with others I have worn.I did not order a 3rd time since both times I ordered they did not fit. It is my opinion that the shoes I received were seconds. Bruno Magli makes wonderful shoes; great fit and comfortable.I was very disappointed."
4,Great pillow but may be too big if you have a queen size bed,"I got this pillow by the end of my first trimester...it is so cozy and soft, I love it! but I can't cuddle with my husband, beware! your husband won't like this pillow especially if your bed is queen size like ours. it takes almost half of the bed. I wish the product had instructions too so you can take full advantage of its functionality."
1,Not worth the money,I was really looking forward for this pillow to arrive and to find some relief from the aches and pains of late pregnancy. This pillow was a big disappointment-- it didn't help at all. The basic flaw is not enough filling in the pillow so there is not much support.
1,Not for me,"Scratchy fabric & made me so hot --> my nights were miserable with it. On the plus side, my husband and I have a queen bed and this didn't take up quite as much room as we thought it might."
1,Disappointed,I had really high hopes for this product given all the positive reviews. The first night wasn't so bad. But the second night that seam on the inside of the curve dug into my shoulder and left me with a neck ache the next day. My husband started complaining the zipper (metal) made too much noise. The stuffing is so so. It looks to be regular old poly-fil And the material used to cover the inserts is your basic cotton. Nothing special about it. Definitely not worth $100. Buy something else.
3,No choice of a pillowcase cover?!?,"So I just got this pillow as a gift. I had never seen it before so my initial reaction was.. there's no option for pillowcase covers? Now I'll have to have a giant white thing on my well coordinated bed. Also, the zipper is one of those huge plastic zippers, and since the pillow is so thin, I keep hitting the zipper. Other than those 2 things, it's super comfortable so far.."
3,Could be better for the price,"I, like another reviewer, had to take the top part of the pillow out. The curved pillow got flatter and flatter everyday until I was waking up with horrible shoulder pain. The bolsters are much better, but they too are getting flatter. I am 3 months pregnant and use this pillow every night. I also have a dust allergy and I have not had a problem with this pillow. It does alleviate my hip pains, but I wish it had a lot more fill in the bolsters. I would think for such an expensive pillow that it would have a lot more fill."
2,Works Great - but not for long,"Truly excellent idea for back pain. I spent MANY $$$ on back pain relief. This worked fantastic for about a month. Then the curved part of the pillow began to flatten out. This pillow consists of three parts. I simply removed the curved part and replaced it with a king size down alternative pillow. Fits fairly well, a bit lumpy. Still releives pain. A cost effective alternative would be to buy a pillow case with this shape and fill it with pillows of your choosing. Be sure it is made well as the zipper will have a bit of stress. Shape definitely works but filler is unsatisfactory."
2,This pillow isn't for everyone...,"Pregnant at 5 months, I purchased this pillow hoping it would help me finally get some sleep. While the pillow is nice and puffy, it's quite big, so unless you have a California King sized bed, your poor husband won't have much room. We're both quite small, and the pillow ended taking over the bed, but we sleep in a queen-sized bed. I'm naturally a side sleeper, so I figured this pillow would be perfect for me. Unfortunately, because it's so bulky and firm, I was getting neck cramps. I kep switching positions from left to right, and I ended up getting less sleep than I did before I got the pillow. For $100, it's better to go get some extra regular pillows. One good pillow for your head/neck, one to hug and tuck under your belly (for side sleeping), and another to put between your knees/legs. I sleep much better this way."
4,Makes sleeping so much more comfortable!!,"I only have two complaints, I'm only 5'2"" and it could use a little more length, and it starts to get a little flat over time... I've been using this for about a month now and the top where my head goes is a little flat. Other than that it's great! I like that it's a U shape so I have support on both sides rather than having to flip the pillow with me."
3,Was expecting more,"Unfortunatey I have not been as thrilled with this pillow as I anticipated. Like other purchasers, I realized that the pillow was not long enough if you want to have it between your feet AND knees. Having the separation between your whole leg down to the foot is what I find to be relieveing of back pain. I decided to flip the pillow around the opposite way as I had read another reviewer tried and this seems to be much better for me. I use my regular pillows under my head and just push this pillow further down the bed to use it for me knees and feet.The pillow itself is good quality, nice and fluffy but it is very large and takes up most of my queen size bed. Im overall glad that I purchased it because it has given me some relief, just not as much as i had hoped for."
5,Helps keep me on my side~,"I am a back sleeper. I have trained myself over the years to sleep on my back due to low back problems. This pillow definitely helps keep me on my side. I do have the occasional wake up on my back but maybe only once per night now. I use the pillow with the opening to the top since I like my normal pillow for my head. We have a queen size bed and it is a tight squeeze for myself, my husband and the pillow but we make it work since it is temporary. :-)"
5,I would like to marry this pillow,THis pillow rocks. It is a little stiff at first but once you break it in you will never know how you did without it. I carry it all around the house with me. I use it in bed and on the couch. I'd take it to work with me if I could
4,Definitely worth the price!!,"As a first time mother, I bought this pillow because of the reviews I had read. I was not disappointed in the quality of the product. I have washed the case a few times and it is super easy to put the pillow back together, it will be really nice to have after baby is here as there is a nursing pillow included. We have a queen sized bed and it does not take up too much space, my husband's only complaint is he can't get as close to me as he likes to...but when I get out of bed, he uses it too!! Overall, I really am enjoying this pillow."
4,"Comfy, but case needs some help","I've been using this pillow for several months now and while I still get hip pain at night, my back pain is mostly non-existent. Also, it provides good belly support, which I'm finding is a necessity at over 7 months pregnant. The problem that I have is the with the case. The seams on the inner curve of the pillow cut into my neck and shoulders, leaving me with marks and pain in the mornings. I quickly switched the orientation of the pillow, so that the head part is down at my feet, and it works okay, but it's disppointing that it doesn't work for me as intended. If the case was made to be seamless on the inner curve, this pillow would be fantastic."
4,A good product,"I am 18 weeks pregnant. I bought this product because I knew I'd need to switch from being a stomach-sleeper to a side-sleeper, and sleeping on my side usually isn't comfortable for me because my knee bones rub against each other. The pillow helps a great deal with this, and I imagine that I'll still use it for a long time after the pregnancy.A good purchase. Definitely worth the money."
5,A TRUE TESTIMONY OF GOD'S GOODNESS,"THIS IS A BLESSED CD, BEING A TRUE WINANS FAN I FOUND MYSELF WELL SATISFIED TO HAVE PURCHASED THIS CD. I LOVE ALL THE SONGS ESPECIALLY LORD LIFT US UP. THIS CD IS A TRUE TESTIMENT OF HOW GOOD GOD IS. IF YOU LOVE BEBE AND CECE YOU WILL DEVOUR THIS CD."
5,4 year old grandson loves this.,I think we have an up and coming bugler in the family. He takes this bugle with him everywhere he goes.
2,Bugle,"Plays alright for an inexpensive instrument to take along camping. Last week I played taps at a funeral, and I chose to use my real trumpet instead. I will continue to take it on scout camp outs."
3,I was channeling Darth Vader!,"I wasn't sure if this mask was working until I took it off and smelled the fumes in the room. When I went back to my refinishing project, I must have knocked something loose when I was adjusting the mask because only then could I smell the fumes as I was completing my project.Overall this is a good mask. I have nothing to compare it to and it will take some getting used to."
4,Great Product!!!!,"This work great. I used it while sanding down my garage and it definitely did its job. It was easy to breath through, it didn't feel like I was stuggling for air. I would recomend this mask if you want to protect your lungs."
4,"Fit is good, wish is was lighter","I've used them for a few wood projects and while sanding walls in the house and they worked great at filtering the wood and spackling dust. They also seem to provide a very good seal around your face without feeling too tight. I used to have a big problem with fogging my safety glasses or googles while wearing regular paper dust masks, but with these the fogging up seems to be more in control as your breaths escape out of the front away from your eyewear.After using them for a few hours I could feel my neck starting to get tired but I guess that would be expected and I can't realistically see them being much lighter than they currently are."
2,Not very durable,"Seems effective but straps that latch on to the side of the mask are very weak. Used to demo 3 bathrooms, they only lasted two weeks"
5,Breathe Easy,"Solid construction, easy to replace filters, and snug fit. I like it. I even use it once in a while when I have a rather bad diaper to change *laugh*"
2,"didn't last, but read my review","i have a 150 gal FOWLR. i utilize 2 coralife 36"" t-5's and a shop light. after 4 years of use one of the coralife's bit the dust. I ordered this as an exact replacement. this one did not hold up. after a few months the ballast blew. I replaced it with one bought locally. I would give these fixtures 5 starts, as I have owned about 5 total and each seem to last about 4 years with about 12 hr's per day use. i must have either gotten a bad one, or one that was used prior to sale."
5,Very Nice,"Its very nice. Black fixture. There is an acrylic cover that can slide out very easily but is fixed with a little tape to opening where it slides out to the side. It is very bright. It can light my 24"" deep aquarium. There are hooks on each side to hook onto the aquarium glass(does't seem necessary though as you will need to place in on a cover on the aquarium) I will be using this over coralline algae for now(corals in the future). It seems pretty good as it's easy to find replacement bulbs over the internet. It includes a blue actinic and a white florescent bulb. I will edit this review in the future to show its performace."
2,arrived broken,Unfortunately it arrived broken. One bulb was shattered (probably in transit). Guess that will teach me to order something so breakable on-line.
1,Bad,I got it and pluged it in turned on fine then shut off . So I called coralife they didn't help at all they never awnser
3,If they work,Purchased two of these one of them worked fine the other didn't work. Thats why I gave it the three star rating.
5,Another Quality V- Tech Phone,"I had owned a V-Tech phone and when it needed a new battery I wanted to purchase a new one. The phone wasn't being made anymore and all of the parts were being discontinued. I decided to buy a new phone, being this one. This phone is super easy to install. Just put the battery in the receiver and plug the phone into a power outlet. Let the phone charge overnight and the next morning you can plug the phone into the jack and you have a brand new V- Tech telephone.The quality, as with all V- Tech phones, cannot be beat. You hear the other party over this phone crisp clear and the quality that went into the making of this telephone shows. This cordless phone is ideal for an extra phone around your house. It is affordable and the quality cannot be beat. This is a telephone that will last for many years. I highly recommend this telephone to anybody that is in need of a great phone."
1,Winging its way back to the shop,"just as soon as I have time to call. Charged it as expected, made one phone call on it, and it hasn't worked since. Tried plugging it in again, but life's too short. I certainly didn't love the too-small, brushed-aluminum handset enough to want to keep it."
2,Not so good,"I returned this phone one day after I bought it. Because every time I picked up the phone, I can hear a loud hum backgroud noise. I have one other cordless(900mhz) and two cord phones. None of them has this problem.Better try it before you buy!"
5,Great Textbook,"This book is in great shape. I am excited to read all the essays included. I was impressed with the speed of delivery and the shape the book was in, top shape."
3,Liftmaster 975LM Laser assist,"First let me say I'am 100% five stars satisfied with 365 Garage door parts, this review is on the liftmaster 975LM laser parking accessory. I've seen other units which have a brighter laser and work better. I ordered this one because it was designed to work with the same manufacture as the door opener. I felt it would be equal to or better than others on the market this turned out to be not true. The strobe feature doesn't help one bit, as the car is moving forward the laser light is not on all the time. You over shoot your mark and have to back up. The laser is also dimmer an makes it harder to see. This unit could be improved by making it brighter and having a continuous laser beam."
4,right on the mark,the liftmaster laser parking assist is a reliable and accurate way to park your car in your garage everytime. well worth the money and the installation was a snap. only wish they would make the laser point a little larger.
3,Helpful parking assistant.,"This laser parking assistant is a great idea, and works well despite its shortcomings as a (very)small pinpoint of light on your dashboard. It was very easy to install and if you want laser precision in your parking space, this is the item to get."
4,works as expected,"works as expected, really easy to install. the light strobes, and is a little difficult to see on a black dashboard."
4,no ugly tennis balls,"I purchased two of these laser parking assists. Was extreemely easy to mount and position the laser to where I wanted it hit on the dash. Does exactly what it says it will do. My only complaint is the size of the laser (could be a little bigger) and the length of wire; was not anywhere near long enough to reach the garage door opener, otherwise, great product. It sure beats two tennis balls hanging in the garage and getting in the way."
1,Not Functional - tech support a joke,"I have spent several hours trying to get this gadget to function withmy LiftMaster garage door opener. After carefully installing perthe instructions, the laser pointer did not light up. I went throughall of the trouble shooting steps without success. Called LiftMastertechnical support, waited 35 minutes to talk to a rep in India(?).Very difficult to understand, rude, and of no use. I tired of wastingseveral hours on what seemed like a good idea. Contacted Amazon torequest a return."
2,Limited usefulness,"I had seen this laser in use and thought it would be great for my needs. However, when I stalled it I discovered the laser I had seen and this one were not the same. What I wanted was a solid beam that could easily be seen. What I got in this product was a pulsing weak beam that is difficult to see. The concept is good, but this product's weak pulsing beam is poor."
1,WARNING: Chamberlain only!,"As mentioned by another reviewer, this is not a Sears Craftsman product. This does not work with my Pro Max opener. There is fine print in the installation guide stating that this is for Chamberlain openers only. Do not purchase if you do not have a Chamberlain opener."
5,Works Great!,"Works as described. Further away, bigger the dot. Most visible when you shine on incline on dash toward driver. I cut a small (1/4"") piece of black gorilla grip tape and placed on dash above radio. I'm able to park the mini van within a 16th of an inch of previous park, every time. Almost like playing a video game every time I get home from work. Try that with the tennis ball method."
1,Does not work on a Marantec opener,This appears to work on Chamberlain openers only. I wish I knew this before I purchased two.
1,Liftmaster 975LM Laser Parking Assist,This might work if it doesn't have to shine through your wind-shield - I couldn't see it on the dashboard.
2,Not compatible with all openers,"Although the transaction and delivery was very smooth and fast, the laser is not compatible with my Linear garage door opener.I can get it to work by unplugging the opener and then turning it back on, but that won't work when I am driving into the garage. Wish they would come up with a practical solution."
2,not worth ordering,"Got it shipped in good time. Hooked up and works as it is suppose to. But not worth ordering. The laser light is hard to see.Had to put the tennis balls back up for the daugther and hooked back up the Park-Zone 120-Volt Dual-Powered Battery-Powered Precision Parking Device #PZ-1500 which works great 80% of the time, on the other stall."
5,Goldilocks would love this book,"Not too long and not too short but very sweet and very funny. This book's main character embodies what I like best about the holiday spirit. She is generous and kind, and is rewarded and appreciated by new friends for her willingness to help (in this case pull a heavy sleigh all xmas eve.) Vivian Walsh came to our school and talked about this book and now I like it even more."
5,"Excellent, sweet story",The story of Olive shows us how we all have strengths and those strengths are important even if they are different from others. It can teach us to be creative on how we can best use our strengths. Most of all it is a sweet story about a very sweet dog named Olive. I loved reading it as an adult and gave it to someone who also enjoyed it very much.
5,A Jack Russell Terrier's Christmas,"Olive, a beautiful, high spirited Jack Russell Terrier wanted to work for Santa. She was listening to ""Rudolf, the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" on the radio one night and misinterpreted the lyric, ""all of the other reindeer"" to ""Olive the other reindeer"" and immediately believed the song was about her. She travels to the North Pole and asks to pull the sled. Santa wisely notices that the little Jack was not a reindeer and that working on his team was very important to her. Taking his reindeer Comet aside, he asked his trusted reindeer to tie Olive to the sled extra securely so she could be part of the team.A cute modification of the Rudolf story using a very appealing little dog, a Jack Russell Terrier. A good story for all ages."
5,Too cute!,"I have spent the last five nights and days reading this book outloud to my kids (5 and 3) The three year old can not get enough of it. The text is sharp and un-saccarine, the pictures different, and the little dog saves the day three times. It's a lively, humerous book that adults and kids seem to enjoy."
5,Best Christmas book ever!,This is the cutest kids Christmas book ever. I originally got this book for my niece.. And fell in love.
5,Olive the other reindeer,Much nicer for little guys than the tv show (a little scary with the evil postman)
5,Like the book....see the TV show!,"Olive is adorable and children love it. This one is sure to be a new classic. Also, I heard there is a TV version of it coming out on FOX, Thanksgiving Day I believe. Watch for promos on Fox coming soon."
4,Cute book,This is a really cute story and the pictures are really cute as well. I bought this for my son for his book advent calendar as he read it at the library last year and loved it. Very pleased with seller.
3,"Good book, not a fan of the format","I bought this for my son today for my IPad Kindle app. The writing is too small and you can't do a portrait view. It does highlight part of the words and make them bigger, but there is plenty of room to just make them all bigger in the first place. It's a idea that just fell flat. The book is a good book though and cute. It doesn't take away from it much, but makes it harder for a kid to read on their own. So I'm rating this version of the book with 3 stars, not really the book itself which I would give 4 stars."
5,Too Cute,"This book is absoulutely adorable!! The artwork is cute too!! I love it and my kids (ages: 7, 4, & 3) want to read it over and over again!!"
5,Great update,I love the special version of this book with the scratch and sniff and cute pop-up at the end. I especially love all the little details in the pop-up. You can look at it from all sides and find a little something of note. I would definitely recommend this book and would encourage you to purchase this version over the regular version.
2,Grandma kicks butt! (more like 2-1/2 stars),"'Shaolin Grandma' in English, this wasn't as goofy/funny as I'd hoped, but still a nice little film chronicling the life of an older lady who was the master of her own kung fu academy - who, one day, is literally booted out (after losing her first fight) by a much younger female rival and one of her goons. Escaping to the streets with her two most loyal students, Granny for the first time has to learn to fend for herself - finding love and loss on the way. Worth a look."
5,For the people who appreciate this kind of stuff... perfect.,"This film is a surreal experience; brilliantly awkward and hilarious on so many levels. Not everyone will enjoy it, but for that certain audience, this is absolutely pure gold. It sort of has a ""Big Man Japan"" kind of strangeness, only somehow manages to be even more bizarre. Watch it with a group and enjoy."
2,Shaolin Grandma,Your website said that this DVD was in english and it was not!I do not like watching movies that are not in english!
2,Not quite what I expected,"I was disappointed but not surprised when the book Iordered came today from Book_holders. Since what I had ordered was supposedly in ""Very Good"" Condition I was expecting a book in ""Very Good"" Condition. What I got was very used, very marked up and very water damaged. I was not surprised because another patron had written a negative comment just prior to our purchase but since the overall opinion was well above 90% we took a chance. I was disappointed because of false advertising and because it should not be a gamble when you purchase from a place with such good reviews. The one bright spot of this purchase was the timely shipping. Coming cross country I was pleased that the book made it here quickly."
5,"Excellent Book, Should Be Required Reading For Any Educated Person.","I was required to read this book as a freshman in college and I am so glad that I did. Very informative and full of statistical data to back up its claims, this is one of the best books I've ever read on the subject. Any educated or well read person should be able to read this book without any problems."
5,Brilliant,"""American Apartheid"" is excellent.It pulls back the curtain on the real-estate industry's malfeasance vis-a-vis black Americans. And, more importantly, it reveals the systemic collusion of local, state and federal gov't in said matter. All of them acted as ""dis""-honest brokers who, for half a century, targeted blacks for ghetto-ization in the form of urban (Indian-like) reservations.Housing discrimination - A metastatic aspect of racism which has befouled the land for 145 years."
4,A book well-worth reading,"Though I can't say for certain, the earlier book reviewer listed here may not be doing justice to what is a complex and sophisticated sociolgical analysis of race and class in the U.S. This book raises interesting and important issues that are salient to political/social discourse in America for years to come. If just for these reasons alone, this book is worth reading."
3,Too Much Qui Gon,"I realize that he is heart broken and all that, but come on! Maybe it is realistic, but it isn't entertaining. Not enough Obi Wan, and when there was, he was out of character. I'm anxiously awaiting the next book. If it continues as this, I will resort to fan fic."
5,My 10 year-old son loves this series,"My son is a Star Wars fanatic and found this series at the school library. Unfortunately, they had only a couple...just enough to get him really into it! So we purchased the ones the library was missing. There are 18 in all and they were a pretty quick read for him. They take place before The Phantom Menace and feature Qui-gon Jinn and Obi Wan. My son definitely recommends these and I recommend them for young adults."
4,A great Navy-murder mystery-suspense novel? Believe It!!,"CAPT Deutermann may be one of the best kept secrets on the book shelves today. This is a great story that will snatch your attention and hold it until after the ""one you would never expect"" is found out. The story is 100% believeable especially if you've ever had anything to do with a military investigation or, more to the point, the NIS."
2,A few flaws...,"Although this cd is good quality, and has many options for each part of class, there are a few flaws. First, the length and tempo for each track is not listed, and many of the tracks are very short. This works if you are teaching a class for young children, however for more advanced classes they are way too short. Also, many of the tracks are versions of popular and broadway music, which to me becomes a little grating after a while."
2,Sleepy time at the barre,I've been teaching ballet for many years and am always interested in finding music that will inspire my students to move. After listening to a few tracks I thought this might be the case with this particular Lisa Harris CD as I've never been a big fan of any other CD's of hers in the past.....now I (again) know why....It put me to sleep....the tempo's and the playing is meant for more of a nap than for a ballet class. Many of the tracks are also not long enough. Why do you have track for 40 secs when many exercises go for nearly twice that - especially in center when you want to repeat the music for groups or lines across the floor....Sorry but this just didn't do it for me...
2,Unfortunately not MY favorite!,"I was hoping to add a good basic CD to my ballet music selection, but this one was a huge disappointment. For one thing, the only list of tracks is on the back of the CD cover... in black ink printed on a black and white (mostly black) photograph, so trying to decipher the text is largely impossible. I have to go online to a website that lists them to figure out what exercises they were intended for and even that doesn't list the time signature or the length which makes picking tracks for my exercises a practice in frustration. The tracks that are on here are far too short even for beginner classes with very simple exercises. The music selection is also rather sappy. I've pretty much given up on using this CD at all for class."
4,"A cute phone, but very annoying!","My husband got this for our 18-month-old son for Christmas as ""his"" gift to him as I had already done all the shopping.It's cute and he played with it all the time. Has lots of little features to it. There is even a phrase (can't remember what it is) that the phone says that he would attempt to mimic every time. Cute!My only problem with this is that the cord ALWAYS comes apart. ALWAYS. Why does it have to snap together? I don't get it. As short as it is, it isnt' a choking hazard, so I don't understand. And on top of that, one of the parts that snaps together is cracked.Would buy again, but it just doesn't seem very durable!"
1,Made cheaply. Worst thing is the short string with no break away like shown.,"It was just a short stupid string. My 17 month old grandson put the phone part to his ear and because the attached string is so short, the base slammed him in the chest."
5,Good,"Great price for the quantity. So far everyone has worked as expected! The case is easy to open though, but may just be the one I got. Discs work fine! We have used Maxell products many years ago. There is no one beat these products. You will never have a failure."
3,Still a question,"I will just make a comment based on some recorded playback issues....I have had some spotty problems with playback on theses discs ....I say this with some reserve due to uncertainty...I have an older, Sony jukebox-style player..and some of the songs would skip...then I would replay and they would sometimes skip again and sometimes not....realizing my player is old, I used a cleaner several times....still had some skipping but very random....I switched to Sony media and have not had an issue so far....Like I said, this is probably not the best comparison, due to older player and vertical playback, but never-the less the Sony media and TDK have not skipped for some unknown reason.......as a matter of fact the Sony media has been perfect for more than nine months now (no bad disc's either)??????"
1,None of these cds works!,Only about 1 of every 3 cds in this pack has been faulty. It's such a waste! Don't buy these cds. What a disappointment.
4,good product,"Nice product, came in perfect condition and sooner then time promised. Calculator was fairly easy to figure out with booklet that came with it. However a tutorial dvd or you tube is needed to understand more involved problems. Basic graphing and algebra is easy to do with the booklet that came with it."
1,Buy a $10 calculator to figure out the cost/benefit ratio!,"I am a engineer. My husband is an engineer. Our children will most likely be engineers, too. Yet, it doesn't take an engineer to see that this sub-type graphing calculator boasts a price only $... less than the TI-89, with the capabilities of a well...suped-up TI-83. It is supposed to be the second to lowest graphing calculator, yet TI markets these as the equivalent of the sports car version of a calculator (TI-89), and why? Gimmicks! Don't fall for the pretty silver. A real mathematician/scientist/engineer doesn't care about color when it comes down to crunch time, and if your kids are serious about school, they'll be more impressed with a TI-86 which is $... cheaper than ""my parents know nothing about calculators so they bought me the prettiest one"" than getting that overpriced swatch-watch looking calculator. Do the math, before you buy this calculator to do it for you."
1,BEWARE OF A SWITCH,"I ORDERED THIS AFTER READING THE MODEL AND THE TEXAS INSTRUMENT WEB SITE.WHEN I ORDERED IT THE PICTURE SHOWED THE CORRECT PICTURE OF THE TI-83 PLUS GRAPHING CACLULATOR. AFTER 2 DAYS I CLICKED THE LINK AND NOW IT SHOWS ME A NEW CALCULATOR AND STILL HAS THE TI-83 DETAILS.BUT NOW IT IS A CHEAP CALCULATOR THAT HAS NO GRAPHING BUT STILL LISTS IT AS THE TI-83 PLUSI HAVE NOT RECIEVED IT AS OF YET BUT I SMELL A BAIT AND SWITCHIN MY EYESTexas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing CalculatorIF THIS DOES HAPPEN I WILL FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE BBB AGAINST AMAZON AS WELL AS SELLERI GUESS AMAZON IS NOT THE PLACE TO SHOP ANY MORE USED TO BE A GOOD PLACE BUT SEEMS LIKE THE BAIT N SWITCH HAS BEEN MORE FREQUENT TO THIS SITE THESE DAYS.WHO NEEDS THE HASSELhere is the detailsGraphing Calculator with Memory, Equation Solver, Statistics, Black TEXTI83PLUSbut not what is thereBEWARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Games,"I just purchased the TI-83 Silver Edition, but I bought it used, so there's no manual. How do I get to the games?"
1,The Reverse Polish System is better...,"My company purchased an HP 32E for my use in 1981. When my own calculator failed (after a very short life), I bought an HP 34C. Now that I am familiar with the Reverse Polish Notation, I will never willingly go back. I now teach college chemistry, and every semester students come to me to find out how to use their (predominantly TI) calculators. The current crop of TIs is (IMO) counterintuitive."
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"Received TI-83 Graphing Calculator ""used- like new"". product was approx $70 - STOPPED working by the fourth time it was being used. Seller would NOT do an exchange/refund (even though it was within 30 days of original purchase). Look elsewhere."
5,calculating,"I purchased this calculator for a college class and had a little trouble getting used to it. The calculator itself was very nice, but needed some more help with effectively using it."
3,Get the 83Plus,"As a math teacher, I would highly recommend for $5 more to get the TI-83 Plus. The are essentially the same calculators, except the Plus provides memory that will be worth more than $5 as you put programs on your calculator--a must for physics labs."
5,The standard in graphing calculators,"I have had my TI-83+ for a while now, and I've never had any problems with it. It is fast enough for Algebra, and also has many good third party applications, including a 3D Graphing program that allows it to graph even faster than a TI-89! This is a superb calculator, and is one of the best I've used."
3,"Happy with the product, not happy with the sellers return policy or lack of communication","The communicaciation with this seller was VERY non exsistant. Even tho I was needing to return this product, she failed to return 2-3 e-mails. Would not buy from this person again"
3,Graphing calculator,it was in decent condition...it had alot of marker writings on the inside of the cover that they did not mentioned but it was able to come off...didnt come with batteries but overall it was pretty good.
4,Graphing Calculator,This is the exact calculator my daughter needed for math. It came quickly and in the 'like new' condition that was expected. It is working perfectly.
2,Not happy,"I only purchased this item because I had to have it for a class in collage. But what I recieved was a dinged up hunk of junk with a screen that has a line threw it that makes it very hard to read the anwsers to the calculation you put into it. No good, just junk. I could have got a nock off brand from Wallgreens for $14 and it would have dune the job. So to sum up how I feel about this Is I paided to much for a abused and broken calculator."
3,it was worth the money i paid for it,i received the product really fast. it does what it needs to do and overall im happy with my buy. the cover doesnt stay on though; it will slide right off. i only need it for a couple of semesters so it will do just fine.
3,ti 83 calculator,"I order ti 83 calculator through Amazon. I received it on time. I open the package and put the battery into the ti83 calculator,the screen shows partially,I mean the calculator is not working properly.So I explained the problem of the calculator through Email. The vendor admit that he didn`t check the condition of the calculator,and he refunded the money. Things happen sometimes."
5,"Long Lasting, Excellent Product","I have had by TI-83 Plus for about 7 years and it has never given me any problems. In terms of endurance, it goes through a lot as I have dropped it numerous times and I don't treat it very well. Even with all of the abuse, it has kept on going with no end in sight.If you are a high school / college student looking to cheat on your calculus homework by having it do your integration or differentiation for you, this is not your calculator. You should get a TI-89. This calculator will do numerical integration and differentiation in the graphical interface but it will not provide analytical solutions to your homework problems.This is an excellent calculator and it has served me well for many years. I am sure it will continue to do so for many more years."
4,Good Calculator,Good calculator - one of the rubber feet came off the first time I was using it but the calculator is wonderful.Darlene
4,TI-83 +,Shipped exactly as stated by the seller. I love the Silver Edition.It is a strong equipment. I'm very satisfied.
3,Difficult to see 2nd and alpha characters against transparent background,It is difficult to see the 2nd and alpha characters printed in yellow and light green against the transparent background of the clear case. Also be careful of unscrupulous sellers who strip all the accessories for retail and sell just the calculator. Read the fine print!
3,Classic but overpriced,"This is pretty much the perfect calculator for high school, get one, learn it, use it. However, for how long this has been around (original 83 replaced with the 83+ when I was in high school a decade ago or more), by now it should have a friggin VGA color touchscreen and 50x the computing power. Texas instruments must make insane profit off selling the same cheap-ass components to millions of high school kids every year.Of course you still have to get one for high school math, so too bad."
3,It's OK,"I'm having a bit of buyer's remorse as I should of got the TI-84 Plus. The TI-84 Plus has more memory and it comes with the usb cable for like 10 dollars more. Overall the calculator is nice though, but I would not buy this model again. For what I am using it for however, it fits me nice so far. Lets hope it stays that way and that I won't have any more regrets. If you're going to buy the TI-83 Plus, get the TI Graphlink USB cord with this, as you will be needing it. I'm probably going to have to order one from here and if you add that all up, I could have just bought the TI-84 and would have been worry free from the beginning. I'm going to try calling my local OfficeMax first, hopefully they'll have a Graphlink USB cord. *Anger*"
5,"Buying used, not a good idea!","I purchased this item at my local walmart it is a great calculator and easy to use, but a little pricey. I had originally ordered this item from a seller titled 1800 calculators who was advertising the calculator as used but ""like new"" the seller totally scammed me, I was charged for the item and told that it shipped but a week later I was told by the seller that it had actually not shipped yet and i spent the next few days emailing back and forth trying to get a refund. Of course the seller had the audacity to ask me to remove my negative feedback to which I responded that I would modify it to include that I was issued a refund finally. Turns out you can't do that only erase it so I guess the seller got their way, but I am posting this to let other buyers know to beware buying calculators such as these used. ALWAYS look very closely into the sellers reviews and keep in mind if it sounds too good to be true it probably is!"
3,Nothing new,"This is an incredible rip off. I have a TI-82 calculator that I bought for school literally 20 YEARS AGO (1991) and it still works just fine. It is almost identical in functionality to this one and I paid the same for it back then that these new ones cost now. Where is the innovation? Technology has come a long way in 20 years, why have graphic calculators stayed exactly the same?Having stated that, Texas Instruments calculators are definitely reliable, and that is a major plus. Not much these days lasts 20 years without falling apart or breaking."
2,2 stars for easy of operation...,"...but 0 stars for reliability. After 2 years of use, my son's TI-83 Plus is kaput. He cannot see the print on the screen (and, yes, we tried all the ""2nd/up"" contrast settings, removing the batteries and resetting steps, etc. Even called customer service). They say his silver screen is shot. Only $58.00 to replace with a reconditioned calculator!!I am inclined to say it's quite a scam that every student in his school is required to buy a TI-83 or 84, because I would love to try a HP to see if the quality is any better. : ("
3,Seems to be okay.,"Needed a calculator for my daughter in highschool. It seems to be working well, although, the light for ""low battery"" came on earlier than it should have, however, it seems to still be going. Not sure if that is a glitch or what."
1,Seller was deceitful,"I order this product for my statistics class I'm taking next term. When I got the calculator is was already used (Which I was not told)! The package was poorly taped shut! And the calculator is out dated, it says on the back that is was made in 1999, It's over ten years old!I thought I was getting a great deal, but in the end it was a waste. I'm going to spend the hundred on a brand new calculator.So be wise and spend the extra money on a new calculator and not on this crap."
4,Has anyone ever wondered...,"why TI doesn't slap a high-res color LCD and large flash memory on these things? Maybe make them half the thickness and weight. What, would it cost an extra [...] for them? We have come quite a long way in the last 10 years... This technology is overpriced and stuck in the early 1990s."
1,Handled problem well.,"The used item didn't work but they handled it very well. I returned it, got a refund, etc. and they were very polite."
4,Nice but a little scratched out.,"The calculator came quickly, it is in good conditions, but a little scratched. It would be terrific to have the manual included. For the price, I think, it is a good deal."
3,Put the Money into a new one,"The overall product is great, not much to go wrong with a Texas Instrument calculator. The only bad issue was when it was listed as used... Man, has this thing been used. It came out of a high school so you can imagine what shape it's in. So, I my opinion if you have the means to buy new or you care about conditions... do it."
3,Great Product,"I have a Ti-83 and a Ti-89. All of my friends have the Ti-83 Plus and they are happy with it. However, I use the Ti-89 on all of my tests because it can easily solve equations that the Ti-83 cannot. If you can afford the money the Ti-89 is a better buy."
2,Disappointed,"This calculator arrived without the instruction manual or cable as was advertised. Additionally there was no packaging therefore, this could easily have been a used calculator. Syarcusecalculus replied that because it was part of a teacher kit there was no packaging and that it was not supposed to come with a cable (the ones in the store do) but did apologize for the missing manual. Then, after I returned the item I did not receive my refund til 6 weeks later, & only after I contacted them again. Finally after I gave them a poor rating they offered me $20 to change my rating to 5 star. Instead I changed it to 2 stars and added these last two sentences."
4,Highly recommended as a first-time graphing calculator,"I've had my silver edition for three years now. I took it with through highschool and now into college. The TI series in general is a very durable class of calculators, but I have never seen anything withstand my backpack for more than a semester, so this one takes the cake. It has the most versatile and self-explanatory features of any other calculator I use. In addition to the extra bonus features (like the periodic and help programs) being able to personalize my calculator makes it a little more me, and less of an obligatory tool."
5,Wow,"For $87? This thing is amazing! I remember way back when I was in Pre-Algebra, our school had one for each kid to practice on. If a whole shool district would buy thousands of these, then wouldn't it be worth buying for you? And, to make things ever better, I live in Loudoun County, VA...which was named the fastest growing county in the Country, so can you imagine how many TI-83 Calculators that is? I no longer own a regular 8-10 digit 4 function calculator. I've carried around this TI-83 for awhile now, and I'm glad! I remember back in school when I would come upon a more complicated problem and think: ""Great, I can't convert this on a calculator"" or ""Darn, It's a multi-stepped problem!"" Well, I haven't ONCE had a math problem, work or school, that I couldn't calculate/graph with ease. Most Graphing Calculators are much more expensive, but this does everything you need, and more! You won't be sorry, and trust me, being a native I would know: Everything is bigger, AND better in Texas!!!"
2,Only buy out of nessesity,"This calculator is not worth the money it costs to buy, its like your grandfathers calculator. TI has failed to improve on even basics like screen resolution. Why? because TI has a monopoly on the market, most math text books today only show how to use TI and most teachers learned on the same them selves and are unfamiliar with other brands. TI can sit comforatbly where it stands, selling mediocre calculators for exorbant prices, reguardless of advances in technology, because thay know you will struggle in any math class without it. Come on TI where is the improvement?"
4,Good product,Good product. Works great and is quite easy to use. The screen is clear and easy to read.
5,Great Service,Item was just as described. Arrived one week after order was placed. I would definately recommend this seller to anyone! Andrea
5,Amazing Calculator at an Amazing Price,"I bought this calculator to get me through my statistics class and figured I would resell it when it was over. No way! I've barely touched the surface of its capabilities, but I absolutely love it! Homework and tests were a breeze using this compared to manually calculating or graphing the answers. I expect it will come in handy in future courses as well.I paid $44 for a refurbished one that works just as good as new, which is less than half the cost of new. I highly recommend both the TI-83 Plus and the reseller, Calcutronics Inc, who shipped it fast and packaged it well."
5,Best Calculator Ever,"The calculator was brand new and exactly what I expected. My teacher recommended I buy this calculator, because Texas Instruments is the most widely used calculator brand in the United States. It worked well for my Algebra 2, Pre- Calculus, Calculus, Statistics, and Physics classes."
4,Works fine,"Bought this used calculator for my Math class, So far throughout the semester I had no problems and it work just as i needed it to."
5,Buy Used,"TI has the most overpriced calculators ever. Very old technology, very old style but they work. Most high school and college txt books give examples using the ti83. That means this model is a must if you have a hard time figuring stuff out on your own. But buy it used for 30 bucks!! No need to pay ti s inflated prices.If you don't mind playing around with things and want to buy new but save money get a Casio! They work just as well, but less supported by textbooks."
2,Worked for a week,"it's a TI-83. Not much to be said there. It worked for about a week before I started getting display issues on my screen. Changed batteries, rested, etc etc. No help."
5,Working properly,This item cost less than half than the new one and working properly. Item came to me in time also.
4,GOOD CALC,Very good product. No problems and it is easy to use. Helped me alot in my classes! Thank you very much!
4,TI-86,I am well satisfied with the Calculator I recently purchased from Amazon.com. It arrived when they said it would. It will help my Daughter in her Senior year of high school and even into her days at college.
1,Don't waste your money,This is the same thing they were selling when I was in high school. Just get a smart phone app kids.
1,Did not Refund when the Item was Returned.,"The package was not opened after I received it. The item was sent immediately back, because I found the object was no longer needed. And for three months I was continuously told the item was not received and was not told whether or not I would get my money back."
5,excellent,"Great product! Needed it for my son's class, he loved it. Reasonably priced. So much easier to buy it from Amazon (and cheaper!) when everyone needs it for same class, and stores running low on quantities."
4,TI 83+ in Brazil,"Hi, is an engineering student in Brazil and I won in the christimas a TI 83+,most of my colleagues students uses HP48/49, since to TI it is not sold in Brazil, buteverybody was impressed with the programming easiness and use for graphs, this calculator is without a doubt very good, still more with the possibility to lower programs for the internet, I recommend its purchase.a hug of the group of mechanical engineering of the cefet of the paraná.p.s.: excuse my English, but I am using a translator."
4,Good way to calculate.,"This hand-held super computer will introduce you to the joys of graphical mathmatics and equations. It's a good way to see the results, but nothing can beat a good text book for a solid understanding of higher math!"
4,Ti 83 Plus graphing calculator,The student is very happy about the product. Delivery by Amazon was on time.We will order again with Amazon
1,Calculator was broken,"I've had this calculator for about a month and I hardly use it, just for chemistry once a week, and it's already broken. I wouldn't have paid 60 bucks for a calculator that lasted maybe a month. I'm definitely upset with the product."
1,bad,really upset i got a semi working calculator. the 0 and negative sign does not work. :( and I still paid a lot for it be careful
3,"Not exactly what I'd call ""like new""....","TI-83 is a great calculator, and it's the one you need for many classes (simplest to use, the rest of the students will have them). However, I purchased one that was supposedly ""like new"". I didn't expect perfection, but I was still disappointed. The rubber feet on the lid are missing, there's a huge shredded sticker on the back, and there are pencil marks on the keyboard. However, the calculator works and I need one immediately for my class, so it'll do. Beware, though, of used products that claim great condition. It's a relative term."
4,Good Calculator overall,"This calculator can do a lot things for you, but it has small memory.Long battery Life,I used it everyday, but haven't change battery for one and half years. But, sometimes, the calculator would get wrong answer. You type in the exactly same equation twice, but get different answers. This only happend twice a year or so."
1,doesnt work,The calculator was out of order after i got it for three days the product looks fine but doesnt work. it shows only black screen i am thinking about return it. is that too late for now ?
4,TI-83 vs. TI-92,"The beginner TI (81, 82, 83) calculators are great for high school math and business type college math classes. However, if you think you're going to head towards any engineering major in college (i.e. you're going to take calculus) you will want a more powerful calculator when you get there. I bought a TI-81 when I was in high school and it was great (then). When I got to college it was fine for first quarter calculus, but by second quarter I wanted something more powerful. I ended up buying the TI-85 which had a bit more of a learning curve, but was a much more powerful and useful tool. In retrospect I wish I would have bought the TI-85 in high school, but who knew! Bottom line... If I were a high school student looking at pursueing an Engineering study path I would go for the TI-92. If I were a high school student worried just about high school or thinking of a Business study path, I would buy the TI-83. Either way the TI is a great calculator, second only to HP!"
1,Complete ripoff,"The TI calculator company has a monopoly on the calculator business because it is the official calculator of all of the major college entrance exams & others. It's 2012, our cell phones have color, our portable video games are in 3D, but the TI series still has a cabbage green screen and the computing power of the original game boy, all the while costing as much as any new electronic device while being made with 15 year-old technology. It's atrocious."
2,NOT Essential For A's,"If you think getting a TI calculator (or any graphing calc.) will help you get higher grades you are absolutely wrong. Having graduated high school, never once using a graphing calculator, I got all A's in math. It's not the calculator that does the work its you. A scientific is a) easier to use and b) all you need.If youre a college student, still it's work ethic, not the calculator that determines your success. But I can understand you now need a graphing calculator, so let me suggest to you the Casio. The Casio calculators are underrated (TIs are overrated x a million) and cheaper and user friendly and equivalent if not better than a TI 83. Don't just get a TI cause everybody else does."
1,calculator,I AM STILL WAITING FOR MY CALCULATOR AND I AM VERY UPSET THAT I HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE THIS. IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE SENT OCT 19 I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY EVEN SENT IT. HOW DOES PEOPLE STAY IN BUSINESS THAT DOES THIS.
4,Great calculator if you have the patience to learn to utilize it,"I purchased this calculator for my algebra I and II courses (and found it helpful for chemistry as well). At first, I was a bit surprised by just how expensive calculators were nowadays, but after using it in class, I found out why - it is not just a calculator, but a mini-computer.PROS: Very powerful. Speed-wise, it runs fine for my use, but they say the silver is faster. Can add in programs like polysmlt (which solves equations). Also does helpul scientific conversions and can determine significant figures.CONS: Expensive. But, then again, you can always sell it after your schooling if you wont be using it again!OVERALL: Very useful product, and since I had to buy a TI-83 or higher for my classes, I'm glad I got this model."
4,A Good Number Cruncher,"Pros: 1. Very fast processor (83+ Silver Edition is supposed be even faster). 2. Easy to read screen, menus are organized. 3. Applications are available, like getting software for your computer. So no two TI-83 Pluses are the same. 4. Finance (I graduated college in Accounting) and Statistics are available off the bat, and can be used in professional fields that does not involve heavy engineering or calculus.Cons: 1. Only 24,000 bytes of RAM, so programs need to be kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, archived programs can't be run like the 89/92 Plus. 2. Only one-letter variable names allowed. Also only room for 10 strings. 3. No percent nor dollar sign characters. So text you write on the program is limited. 4. Lot of advanced features, in the course of applications, will come within time. Would you have the patience?Overall: Good for those who are not into heavy programming per se and very good for general purposes, number crunching."
2,Alright while it lasted,Was working good for a few days but after it just started to blurr and the number and anything else is no longer visible
4,Needed this for school. Calculus is very hard without one of these.,"Didn't come with a manual. Still expensive for an older model. But I got one that's for sure at a better price on Amazon than I could have purchasing a newer model. Still able to use this for school. Cal 1, 2, 3, 4!!! It only gets harder!"
5,Great Calculator,"Product was in excellent condition, works wonderfully, seller shipped very quick...with in days. Received it within a business week! Very pleased!"
4,calculator for my brother,I got this for my brother who needed it for stats i like the look of it and it has the extra memory and usb capability but i didn't like the way you cant put the cover on the back when you use it but my brother doesn't mind so over all it was a good buy
4,Best graphing calculator but pricing seems high,"We used this calculator for an intro to statistics course in college. Although it was many buttons overrall it isn't complicated to use. The calculator comes with cover,manual but not the usb cable. The price seems to be high for a college student. College students pay enough for tuition, commuting, and books. Texas Intrument should consider a price drop to make it more economical to students."
4,Powerful and full of Functions,This was one of the calculators that was permitted for the exam I was going to take. My main problem was that I had this just one week before the exam and could not find enough time to learn how to use all of its functions properly but it seems to have lots of capabilities and I am hoping to be able to learn all those. It did not come with the USB Cable and the complete manual and I had to go to Texas Instrument site to download the manual. Overall it is a good and powerful graphic calculator and I am sure I will use it a lot.
4,Buy Gently Used,"If you do not know where all the buttons are on this calculator do not go with the cheapest one, some of the symbols may be wiped off from being used so much. Other than that it's an easy to use calculator."
4,excellent,"The programming is easily learned and a wide variety of programs are available on the Internet. (Including games to play during boring classes...) I would definitely recommend this calc for any middle school or early high school math classes. I bought this calculator while taking a Algebra class in middle school, since then I have also used it in Geometry and Algebra II. It is a great calculator!"
1,Broken,I do not recommend purchasing products from this seller. My son owned this calculator for just under a month and it stopped working!! He took very good care of it and stored it in a safe place when not in use too.
1,Big Disappointment,The calculator stopped working after 3 months of use. I am very disappointed in the product and now had to spend more money to replace it with a new one.
2,Problems with batteries,Once the batteries died - replacements batteries done work. Waste of money. It was great while it worked for the 1st month. Then no good!
3,crap,When i got this calc sent to me it was used and i wasnt sure if it was going to work too well. it worked for a few days and then gave out.
1,Usually I don't rate THIS bad,"I've had my TI-83 since August 2003. Thirteen months later, September 2004, it refuses to turn on. I've done everything Texas Instruments has told me to do (which takes forever just to reach a real person). I wasn't going to pay for service when it was only one month past the warranty. (...)"
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased last year for my son. He used a handful of times and then it simply quit. It contains a watch battery and 4 AAA batteries, After replacing all the batteries, It remains DEAD. I would not recommend this product. BUYER BEWARE!"
4,No batteries,It is a fine calculator and my daughter is having no problems with it. My only coment is that for the price that we paid you would think that the batteries would come with it.
4,"If you need a good calculator, buy here . . .",I needed this calculator for a statistics class but did not want to pay full price for a new one. This one was used but in excellent condition. I couldn't have gotten through the course without it. I paid extra for expedited shipping and it still cost way less than a new one! Good value.
1,Device was in poor condition.,"The seller stated that the calculator was ""likr new"" and when it arrived, we did not know how to use it until my son began learning to in school. Until then, it sat on a desk for a month untouched. As soon as my son began to use the calculator, he noticed that the bottom of the screen was faded away so that you could not see the entire graph or calculation. Now the seller refuses to return & refund!"
5,wonderful,"I am so happy how fast this product came, it was brand-new with the case and it wasn't full price"
5,"Simple, Yet Effective","I love this calculator. I used it so often. I even made my own programs on it. The calculator had all the functions it needed, and nothing more. Mine was stolen, and I purchased a TI 89. I was dissapointed by the 89. It was simply to complicated. The manual was so large that it came on a CD! Get the 83 Plus! It is the best!!!"
1,Why do we still use these?,"If you're under 30 you've probably used one of these before, and it works just as you'd expect. The question is, why are we still paying 100 dollars for technology from the stone age? Probably the same reason I spent 300 dollars for a single book. They were first introduced as the TI83 in 94, and Texas Instruments just keeps on rolling in the dough. Unless you've got a college professor that's requiring you to buy this calculator... DON'T! Do NOT! buy it.Do yourself a favor and download Wabbitemu, then download the ROM from TI's own website for free and run an emulation of the calculator on your PC. Or find and run an emulator on your smart phone..When you can purchase a laptop for sub 300 dollars, why would anyone want to purchase a 100 dollar brick of technology? Not to get all conspiracy theory ... but this whole education system is starting to feel a lot like a ponzi scheme."
4,My Baby!,"I love my calculator. It's perfect for my math class. I would reccomend for anyone in high school math to own a graphing calculator. I have a less powerful calculator (only a TI-30 or something like that) but I never use it. I mostly like being able to see the problems that I've done. With my 30, I never got that and I'd do things twice or make mistakes. Now I can see what I've done which helps me make connections. There are a few features that I love1. Prob Stimulator->I must admit when you already know the material that is being reviewed in class, it's very entertaining to roll dice. (What can I say? I'm a freshman ;-) )2.Graphs-> duh, this is used very often3. Under the math menu there is a button I use often. You can change decimals into fractions! I know! It's fantastic! You can *gasp* get the fraction for that long nonterminating decimal."
3,The Sally of the calculator world,"This calculator is pretty good in terms of the statistics package that it offers. However, other than that there isn't much to be said for this piece in comparison with other TI's. It puts in a lot of annoying parentheses in places where they aren't really necessary. Plus many of the options take up the whole screen so you forget what function you're actually trying to use. So if you want to do math like a cupcake, this thing will suffice. If you want to roll with the big boys buy something else."
1,Broke and Dirty,All I have to say is that the item came very dirty and I had to clean it up. Then the enter button stopped working after a couple of days. I would've returned it but my mom threw away the package it came in. I ended up getting a gift card from Target and used that to buy a new one. That's the disavantage of buying used.
1,non working calculator :(,"I really needed this calculator for school so instead of buying a new one I bought a use one here , It Does not work so now I have to buy a brand new one . I should of done that in the first place, If I had the owners email I would demand a refund of my money"
3,TI-83,"It's a good calculator, but I recommend getting a TI-89 instead. Sure it costs more and it's more complicated, but you'll outgrow the 83 if you take anything past algebra."
1,Seller is not honest,"I bought a graphic calculator from this seller and the description said it would come with the manual, instead I received what looks like a homemade CD but NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL CAME WITH THE GRAPHIC CALCULATOR AS PROMISED. I would not buy this unless you can get your instruction manual for this graphic calculator. I DID NOT GET WHAT I PAID FOR! This was a bad sell. Still waiting for Amazon to do something about this.Im not happy with Amazon at this point or the sellers."
1,Bad Calculator,I received the calculator but it does not work anymore and i have only used it for a little while and i have changed the batteries but nothing works. I am upset with my purchase since i didnt pay for whay i got. I paid for a god calculator and i didnt get that.
1,Never recommend to buy it,"I bought it in spember 2011. It does not works very well. I shipped it back but the seller did not give me full refund. I lose twenty dollars for this product. So do not buy it, especially the refurbish!"
1,not yet received,Ordered product on 8/30/11 - estimated delivery by 9/12/11 which is today.. This item has not even been shipped yet.. No notificaton on why shipment is delayed
5,Great product!,"This product is absolutely the best purchase I have made on Amazon. The sellers described it exactly as it was, and it was a great deal. I received it about a week after placing my order. Awesome!"
2,TI What?,"I didn't get no TI 83. The advert says TI 83, but the item is actually TI 85!??! What-a-guan???"
2,Ripe off,The company that sold the use device showed it with the computer connector cable and the carrying case at list price. You can get it cheaper at radio shack.
2,"Good calculator, awful condition.","I just received my calculator, and I am disappointed in the condition that I have received it in.The description says that it includes the calculator itself, the case, four double A batteries, and the guidebook. All I received was the calculator. There were no batteries inside, there was no case on it, and there was no guidebook included in the package."
1,Calculater broke days after received,The stupid calculater broke a week after I bought the thing. It won't turn on anymore even with new batteries. I expected better out of Amazon and will buy elsewhere next time.
5,great tool,Got this for my daughter who is a junior. She uses it for Trig and Calc. Seems to work fine and has all the necessary applications for these subjects. Seems to be the teacher recommended item.
4,According to my calculations...,"Awesome buy. Good condition, a little out of date, but still calculates numbers. No problems to report."
3,it has no instructions,Calculator is in good shape. The only problem is that there is no instruction book. I have never used this type of calculator and without instructions it is almost impossible to use it to its full potential.
2,TI-83 Plus,"I was happy with how fast I received the item, but the keys on it are very sticky like something had been spilled on it and you really have to push hard on some of them to make them work. Not happy with that. I did not receive the USB cable with it either."
4,Just no battery,Everything is good with the calculator but I found it weird not to have battery with it. It would be much better if it comes with battery.
2,Flimsy toilet seat lid,Lid is too thin. It bends when you sit on it. I'm afraid it will crack after it has been used for a while.
3,No indication that it is a surge protector,"Surge protectors usually have a light or an indication or a label that it is a surge protector. Some would have an LED light to indicate that the surge protector is working, when the light is gone the protector is not working. I was surprised that Belkin would not have this. I searched for a label and found one at the back of this item a barely readable label almost hidden. 3 stars."
3,"A surge protector, it protects against surges","One plug does not work, but for the price, it was still worth it. A nice, basic surge protector!"
2,"chaep and small, very small","this is a very cheaply made item. the holes are very close together making use of an adaptor impractical asi it covers 2-3 of the outlets (depending on adaptor size. i paid 7 and feel ripped, at 4 would have been fair. another big problem is there is no on-off switch nor any lights indicating it is on (i should have looked at the pic)...this is a huge problem for me. my other outlet plugs have a main on-off switch which i find need of many times. seeing how cheap this is, how small, i wonder IF it will really do the job of protecting...how does one ever know until a fatal strike to equipment. i guess one is paying for the belkin name."
3,Not a flat plug.,"I mistook this product for the shorter version of this:Belkin 6-Outlet Home/Office Surge Protector with Rotating Plug and 8' CordUnfortunately, I was wrong. I am looking for a short surge protector with a flat plug to put behind the nightstands in our bedroom. Then, the nightstands will sit flat against the wall and we can still plug in lamps and phone chargers (into the surge protector). I admit that I should have investigated further before buying two of these, but the product description and pictures really aren't that informative. Hence the 3 stars.These are going back without being used, but they LOOK well made for the price."
1,TERRIBLE...Failed completely in a few months,"I've used this extension cord for exactly 5 months, and it just stopped working suddenly out of the blue. I've used several other brands Surge Protector and they've NEVER failed me for several years. Even the $3 cord at Walmart lasts longer.Probably the only thing that matters in these types of products is reliability. And this is precisely where the product comes unstuck. STAY Far away from this one. THUMBS DOWN!"
3,It's good but a little simple.,"It's a little simple. What I prefer is something with more functionalities. But for the price, it's good enough. And for other respects, it's very nice."
1,Cheaply priced JUNK,"Poorly designed. One set of slots on back to wall mount. Of course those are on one side, not the center, so when you install the unit it rocks around on the wall. IMPOSSIBLE to mount flush. Also, and quite expected of something this thoughtlessly designed, the slots are upside down so you must install the unit upside down in order to put each of the screw heads in the fat end of the slot and let the shaft of the screw drop ""securely"" into the small end. This item just falls short all the way around. I will not pay shipping to return it but looking at it mounted askew on the wall right now with the word ""NIKLEB"" staring at me is bugging me as I write."
4,good and durable,"for the price you can't go wrong! only thing I wish is that the cord was a bit longer. Beyond that, it was a great purchase, bought two."
1,dead on arrival,"Unfortunately, I did not test this when it was delivered. And a couple of months later realize this belkin surge protector was dead on arrival."
4,"Does What it says, Looks Good Doing It","Nothing special about this surge protector, but that shouldn't be taken as a negative. This is a solid surge protector at a great price. It provides everything you would expect in a surge protector in this price range. It looks good too. I have every reason to expect this last a long time."
4,It is what it is...,"Seems like a well built Surge Protector. I bought two, one for my bedroom TV and Cable Box, and another for our Treadmill. Both work great. Cord is heavy duty and should survive any kitten attacks. I am pleased with this surge protector and the value."
1,slim design doesnt mean it has a flat plug,I was expecting this item to have a flat plug. I am disappointed that it doesnt have a flat plug AND that i cannot return or exchange this item. Guess i am stuck with it.
5,does what it's supposed to,The cord is a bit stiff which limits mobility but other then that it's solid and does what you expect.
4,Cheap and practical,For its purpose it works just fine. I need many types of cords for my home theater system and a basic power strip is a must. note that when using plugs with oversized ends often times leads to only three able to fit out of the six possible slots.
4,"Does the job, the cord is a little short","This is a nice, pretty small surge protector. My computer still works, so guess it's doing it's job. The cord is a little short--that could be either good or bad, depending on your space."
1,defective/poor quality,"i bought three of these and had problems with all three! as another reviewer noted, any time you touch the wire, this thing goes off and i have to manually reset which causes an odd buzzing that i don't like the sound of. i have this under my computer desk and occasionally hit the wire with my feet. a surge protector should be more robust than this and since i have had the same problem with three units ( i bought them all at once or would never repurchase)i don't believe it is a rare defect but built into the design."
5,Nice little outlet,I don't know what to say but it works and looks nice and the price is good. It is not so big the outlet is easly over loaded.
1,It doesn't work,"Waste of money, it doesn't work at all. There should be a zero point possibility, it is just cheap enough to not send it back."
3,short cord,"Seems to work fine. (You never know until you have a voltage surge)BUT the cord is not 2.5 feet! It is ""almost"" 2.5 feet to the tip of the plug. Most times not a concern but for my instance it's 2 inches too short."
1,does not work,I guess that price mattersI have had this strip for only 6 months and it stopped working. It had very light usage and just quitthis is so disappointingI now have to purchase another one
3,not bad,there is no light indicator whether the device is switched on/off. the switch is also in an awkward position to easily reach. other than that its fine and working.
4,Almost no complaints,"The 6' cord is nice, and otherwise not really any complaints...except the on off switch is in a kinda awkward place, and its hard to tell wether its on or off."
1,wasted money,i left a relationship and packed up my stuff. i had left all of my surge protectors (3 of them). i selected the belkin six outlet surge protector off of amazon. it arrived with a 2 foot power cord that was curled up like a truck spring. once i plug it into the outlet the power cord curls up like spring because the surge protector is made of cheap plastic thats not as heavy as the protector. to make things worse any electronics with a three prong plug doesn't work in the belkin surge protector.
1,never buy this...,I bought 4 quantities and 2 of them are not working at all!!!I recommend you to never by this product...
5,Does what it needs to do,"The item shipped quickly and got me set up in no time. This is a no-frills surge protector, and I would not expect anything more or less at the price, which is right, by the way. The downside is the plug configuration, which will not hold many bulky AC adapters. Another downside is the short cord, but it is very sturdy."
5,"short surge protector, just what I needed",I needed some surge protectors with shorter cords for my kitchen and bathrooms. these were perfect for the job at a reasonable price.
4,very good for the price,"My only criticism of this well priced surge protector is that is has a very short cord. That said, it is very good for the cost."
5,No problems so far,There really isn't much to say with a product like this. I purchased it from Amazon over a month ago and through it where it was needed and haven't had a problem with it. Solid product.
3,Simple Surge protector,I haven't tested this under the conditions of a power surge. I use it mainly to turn it off/on with the switch and you could plug in several devices (unless its one of those plugs that takes up an outlet and a half). I would recommend to invest into quality power surge protectors for your expensive electronic equipment.
2,Why don't they tell you the joule rating of this surge protector?,"The joule rating indicates the degree of protection a surge protector provides. If they don't give you that info one can only assume it's not that good. The minimum joule rating should be 400-600, though higher is usually better."
3,Short cable,"Only have it for a few days and seems to be working fine, although I only use 2 plugs so far.The surge protector is ok, but the cable is TOO SHORT!"
3,"First shipped item had problems, second is OK","I have chosen this item because it is cheap and because of the user reviews were OK.When I received the first outlet it almost exploded when I plugged it and pulled the switch. It was connected to my Internet router (the device I wanted to protect!) and I was worried it had been damaged. It was not the case, so I think that the surge protector somehow worked. This is why I asked for a replacement. I am using the new surge protector with no problems at all. Currently my Internet router, laptop, NAS and printer are connected to it and everything works fine."
3,Cheap Surge Protector,"The surge protector doesn't have anything special about it. It has a short cord, no room is left for bigger plugs (except maybe the last one). I first thought that it arrived dead because no power went through but as I wanted to throw it out, I noticed that there was a switch hidden next to the power cord to turn it on. It is the first surge protector that I have seen that doesn't have the switch at the top.At least it was cheap and does what is supposed to do and if you don't want a light on your surge protectors than this is probably a good choice for you."
3,Great but needs and on/off indicator light,This is a great little surge protector but it would be so much better with an on/off indicator light. I also overlooked the fact that it only has a 2.5' cord but it works OK since most everything I have plugged into it comes with longer cord.
5,Great spike bar,"This spike bar is awesome and the color is very nice in my opinion. It comes with a warranty protecting all your devices plugged into the product. if your devices get damaged from a shock while plugged in the spike bar then the company will replace it up to a certain dollar amount which i think is $10,000."
4,Reasonably good,"This works well, except my computer charger often falls out of it, and the outlets are close together, so that my chargers will often take up two or even three spaces. Otherwise, its a great value."
5,Have had this for awhile now and it works great,Go Belkin or go home. I hook my Mac Pro up to this baby. All the outlets still work. Bought this almost a year ago. Definitely recommend it for the price.
3,"Ok, problems","Works like all standard power strips....but that is the problem. Most people now a days have AC adapters and non-conventional plugs that need to be plugged in, and these standard strips have no way of accommodating that. I recently purchased a ""squid"" 5 outlet thing, and it was great. separate plugs, and worked great for me."
4,"value item, smart design","Very good price, and it has intelligently placed on/off button so it doesn't get in the way of the plugs."
5,Belkin Surge Protector,This product is priced reasonably and is shipped out fast. It has worked great to this point.
2,Belkin power strip,"It works, but I regret this choice. I overlooked the short cord (2 1/2') which limits it's usefulness. The orientation of the outlets makes it a poor choice for use with converters, since most will cover 2 outlets."
3,The connecting wire is not long enough,the connecting wire is very short which creates a lot of problems. Also the plug sometimes get disconnected. This might be the problem of my home too.
3,just so so,"a beautiful product, but there a hole have some problem, i couldn't put the cord in to the holes! luckly there other five holes are work well!but i think this is the quality problem of amazon's product, they should check every commondities carefully!"
2,Wire provided is too small,Wire provided with the surge protector is too small. Rest everything is fine with the product.Packaging is also good
2,eh,this is more of an extension plug... doesn't protect well... Order a product with more jules to portect your valuable items.
4,a little TOO protected,"The child safe feature on this surge protector is STRONG, i mean, a little too strong. The force it takes to insert the male end of plugs into this, is pretty extreme, almost to where you feel like you are about to break something before it goes in. It does work great though, just know you aren't doing something wrong when you have to muscle things into it."
1,Do not buy this! It is just a cheap crap..,"I purchased this one on 5/1, and received it on 5/4.It has been used like 2,3 times and the total time is less than an hour.Now it is dead and I can't return it either.If you just want to risk your $7, please go ahead. However, if you ask me, I would say it is NOT worth at all."
1,Died in 3 months.,Bought this from Amazon last fall. It lasted 3 months before dying. Not worth the cost of warranty replacement; shipping would cost more than a replacement unit. Will not be buying Belkin products anymore.
4,Good Value,This is a good surge protector for the price. It probably isn't ideal if you have several large adapters/transformers. Having the on/off switch out of the way is a really good feature.
5,Wilton Video a winner,"Have taken two Wilton classes and wanted to learn more. Bought this video and really do love it.Fun to plug it in, and practice along with the instructor..don't get it? Rewind!!! Rewind!!Rewind!!! OH!!! Now I get it. Looking forward to the day w hen Wilton has an advanced video on gum paste flower making."
5,Who knew it was so easy?,This video makes decorating easier and has a lot of great tips and tricks! My first cake came out really pretty and I got lots of complements. Making a cake for my in-laws 50th anniversary this weekend and plan on placing some beautiful golden flowers on top! Video seems a little dated but the techniques work so it really doesnt matter.
2,Ok not best quality DVD and very dated,Not best quality DVD. Dated material but good start in understanding the foundation of basic cake decorating. Too expensive for what it is.
3,alright but a class is better,"This video is ok--you get a lot of ideas and can learn a lot, but it's rather out-dated, I think. Also, it's no replacement for taking a Wilton's class. Check out a Michaels or Hobby Lobby near you."
1,bad sound quality,"I bought one with $15 rebate, sounds like a good deal. But the first one didn't work at all. I went back to the store and replaced with another one. This time it works, but the sound quality is pretty bad. I can still hear the other party, but the sound was very much distorted."
5,Good Basic Phone,"This phone works great, I bought it for my dorm room because I didn't need caller id(not available in the dorm) or an answering machine (we have voice mail), plus it was CHEAP! It works anywhere in the 4 story, 200 room dorm building. I love it!"
4,Its Cheap and it works,"Does this phone have bells and whistles? Of course not its a $10 cordless phone.Does it work, yes!It works better than the 2.4 Gig phone I purchased to replace it when the battery started to get weak.I still use it at work, where it sits on the charger all day, so battery life isn't an issue."
1,v9118 bad phone,"I had the v9110 first and this is the phone vtech replaced it with. It is the worst cordless phone I have ever owned. They are replacing it agian with another model, but they don't give you replacedments for the quality of the one you purchase originally.The 9118 has bad sound quality, 1/2 hour talk battery life and doesn't pick up right away when you answer the phone. My opinion is the phone sucks!"
1,Avoid this recording,This is a great compilation of country hits...sung by a bunch of nobodies. These are not the original recordings but covers that sometimes are reminiscent of the original artists but most often are not. Buy the originals instead.
5,A wonderful resource for anyone who wants to grow closer to God,"I should just buy a dozen of these books at a time. I keep giving them to people who ask about growing closer to God through prayer. A wonderful resource for beginners and a refreshing look at prayer for ""seasoned"" prayers."
4,As supplementary text,Comprehensive and reader friendly. Plan to recommend for student purchase as supplementary text in adult religious ed course. Also interested in other books by this author.
4,Above Average Thriller,"Gavin Lyall's books are now largely out of print. This is a pity because he produced a number of very good espionage thrillers, mainly set during the Cold War. This book, one of three whose protagonist is a British Army officer named Harry Maxim, is typical of Lyall's output with clever plotting, solid characterization, and decent writing. Well worth a few dollars in a used book store or looking up in your local library."
3,Not up to the original,"I have been a fan of the Goal since I worked on my MBA 10 years ago. I like to reread the Goal every 5 years or so. When I found this book online and realized it was the next book in the series I just had to buy it. It follows the same premise as the Goal. It's written in the same style as the Goal. But it leaves too many holes in the process unlike the Goal. I wanted to know more about how Alex was developing the ""trees"" and it gave me fluff and results not details. Still it was a very interesting read as this is a very interesting topic for me."
5,Applying TOC to Sales & Marketing,"""The Goal"" was written to introduce Goldratt's Theory of Constratins (TOC) to production problems, but it also suggested applications to sales and marketing. ""It's Not Luck"" takes us beyound ""The Goal"" and applies TOC to sales and marketing problems directly, with implications for corporate strategy.No new theories are proposed, but Goldratt does not need to. Instead, one follows Alex Rogo as he becomes a true beleiver in TOC. He learns how to apply TOC to distribution channels, expensive high-ticket technology sales, and even commodity, price-driven situations. He also begins to understand how to use TOC to build a wider corporate strategy.Nothing new is needed beyound what has already been introduced in ""The Goal"" The application of TOC to sales & marketing provides a more vivid picture of the power of TOC. If you liked ""The Goal"" then you will like ""It's Not Luck"". I did."
2,Limited Usefulness,"The Goal has some usefull stuff, the TOC and DBR. The Thinking Process is useless!"
4,"Eli, you should re-hire Jeff Cox...","In term of contents, this book is marvelous. In terms of plot and story-telling style, this book is quite dry for a novel, comparing to THE GOAL.This book doesn't offer a pleasure of good reading. That makes it huge different with THE GOAL. Eli probably needs Jeff Cox to fix them."
5,Rigor made Rational - an introduction for the textbook,"This book, in novel form, is a description of the ""Thinking Process"" of Theory of Constraints. This Thinking Process is really a bookkeeping process to provide rigor in rational thought. The story line is a bit weak, but as others have observed, it makes reading the dry processes fun. Once you have read this book, and are convinced that moving from a current reality [tree] to a future reality [tree] with the clouds removed is going to require the construction of a transition plan [tree], but you need some help, read ""Thinking for a Change"", by Lisa J. Scheinkopf - ISBN: 1574441019"
2,It's not luck,too complicated what's the point? get to the root cause and come up with a clear solution and procedures for the reader to have examples. I think!
4,It's not The Goal...,"... but it's alright!You must have read The Goal before embrassing this one. Although useful for a better understanding of the whole Goldratt's TOC especially in marketing and distribution, this novelesque management book suffers a little from proseltism. The reverence for Jonah's figure, even when solving personal problems, it's a bit abusive..."
3,Another Goldratt Novel... Good but not Great,"Goldratt takes us through he paces again, but this time not quite as ground breaking and informative as the Goal. Of course the Goal remains standard reading for all young managers in any sort of manufacturing environment, and the TOC is a baseline concept that they should wrap their mind around. This book is good and adds a little refinement on top of the previous books, but should definitely be down in the pile. Start with the Goal, and keep this book on the low priority / rainy day list."
4,Excellent Read,"This is a great next book after ""The Goal"". While ""The Goal"" was pretty well centered on operations, anyone can use the tools presented in ""Its not Luck"". I think that this book is can help most in forming strategy or analyzing market conditions.An excellent read that for anyone."
4,Almost Perfect,"This book describes Goldratt's method of solving problems, resolving conflicts, and how to apply his methods to sales, marketing (there is a difference), and general business management.As a novel, it doesn't really hold my attention. But the ideas do. Presenting them as a book is a, ahem, novel way of doing it. It holds my attention better than reading a how-to book.The process is hinted at, but not completely described. This is different than ""The Goal,"" which came right out and told you what to do. I think that Goldratt was trying to promote his consulting company as much as sell a book."
4,"Excellent process analysis techniques, but ...","... not as readable as The Goal. This jumps right into the analysis techniques he wants you to use, rather than setting up the story more. The techniques look like they're very useable, but at this point, I want some sort of concise manual to explain how to walk through them in a more organized fashion. Language is also a bit more stilted than The Goal. I guess Jeff Fox helped with the wording on the previous book, because I found myself saying ""Nobody talks like that!"" So, the message isn't as readable, but it's probably much more important."
1,Among the worst printers in the world.,"Please, please DO NOT BUY this printer.Dont fall into the same mistake I did by thinking that becauseit is a major brand it would be a good product.IT IS NOT, it is a complete waste of money. Save yourself theaggravation."
3,A madcap farce,"Mr. Brewer is not trying to write literature in this novel, nor indeed anything the slightest bit serious. He has instead given free reign to his comic impulses to create a fun, light, madcap farce involving an assassination in Las Vegas, and the crazy, off-kilter, and wacky people that get swept up into the action. This is meant as pure comedy, and reminds me of those 1950 TV sit-coms like Gomer Pyle in its feel and mood. It's a simple light-hearted farce and good for filling in a few moments, but this is not going to be one you remember for the rest of your life. After reading it I can't say I really thought that much of it; the book is short and the chapters even shorter (most going for two or three pages only). If you in the mood something lighter than helium and crammed with a surplus of comic relief than this will fit your bill......but it's hard to create a good book when all the cast are comic relief and there is no foil for them. This is pure Bridget does Assasination."
3,"works fine, just think its overpriced","Nothing to do with the seller as their price was the best around, just seems like a lot of money for what it is, works fine in our physical therapy setting, just saw similar products for use in building and they were much less expensive."
5,Great Purchase,Great purchase for any physical therapist or PT student. Easy to use and worth the price.
4,"Sex, Ambition and Family Feuds","This wide ranging, three generational, family saga describes Scottish society from the 1930s to the 1990s. It takes the reader on a journey before, during and after the Second World War, and we follow Alexandra Meldrum during her rise from a bare-foot child to the time when she becomes a rich and powerful tycoon. Alexandra makes her mark on a declining shipbuilding industry as well as taking risks in the burgeoning oil industry, and during all this Scotland is well portrayed. Over and above the historical content is the thread of the Armstrong, Meldrum family feud, which destroys the love affair between Alexandra and Robert Meldrum, and blights a large part of Alexandra's life.This saga has everything you expect a saga to have - sex, passion, lust, ambition and power. Netta Martin tells a good story."
3,Pretty Darn Silly,"Jas Mann has the music and feel down, but his goth-lite lyrics could use a major overhaul. Track down the single of ""Spaceman"" that was shipped to radio stations (most US used record stores sell it for a buck). That gets you the best track of the bunch (plus a cool remix), and you can hold out for his next attempt."
3,There and back again,"Jas Mann appeared out of nowhere, took over Britian, then vanished. Quite a feat, actually. But now that it's all over, we're left with this...thing. He can play, and string hooks together, and if his singing voice leaves something to be desired, he's no different from many other artists of the day. But the truly strange things here are the lyrics. ""Electronic information/television takes control/there's a fire between us/but where is your god""? What? The lyrics sort of hint at some threatening...something, but never paint a very vivid picture. It ends up being fifth-grade poetry to (rather) cool music. The less attention I pay to it, the better it sounds. If that sounds interesting, by all means, pick up one of the $1 used copies..."
4,London town is burning ...,"I bought this CD a long long while ago (4 years?) mainly because I loved ""Spaceman"" off of the 2nd Mortal Kombat Soundtrack. This album perplexed and intrigued me like no other album before. I suppose you could describe the sound of The Boy With the X-Ray Eyes with something like a sci-fi Oasis. There are some beautiful and brilliant songs on here of worlds ending, souls selling, and drugs inducing. There are also some weak tracks that don't attract much attention (""Paris Green"" & ""Fire Guided Light"" come to my mind). Personally - I'd recommend anyone to buy this record simply for track 10, ""Is Your Soul for Sale""."
2,One hit wonders...but what a HIT !,"The self- proclaimed genius. The band that took over ( not only in UK, but in the whole Europe) all the charts back in 1995-96. The band had a come back with a Oasis sound like again, which was a disaster , not even the record company wanted to spend money on his second effort.Now let me focus on this album. I'm sorry but i like only the first two tracks, which were the singles and their only successes.A very hard effort to sound electronic, but Oasis like, some weird lyrics and that's pretty much about it.Also the sound is very repetitive , during the whole CD, specially the guitar sounds the same in all the songs. The keys, the notes, whatever you want to call it.A self - proclaimed genius that will be remembered as ''the Spaceman dude''.Not enough for me, tho, even i was crazy about that song."
3,Tastes change,"It's really creepy how similar Reticuli's thoughts of this album are to mine...this causes me to believe that were not the only ones who loved this album as young teenagers, and now see it as sort of juvinile and dull as adults. When I was younger, I thought that Babylon Zoo were going to be the next big thing, I loved this album. I went on about a 5 year hiatus and then came across it again. I was expecting it to be wicked, but I was disappointed. I guess my tastes have just evolved. Therefore, from my experiences I would recommend this album to teens who like the alternative scene."
4,A Different Kind of Good,"I first heard these guys on the 'Mortal Kombat: More Kombat' CD, and I thought that Spaceman kicked @$$. I sort of forgot about them for a while until I found one in a local music store. I was supprised that their music wasn't all as powerfull and rock-heavy as Spaceman was, but all of the songs are still great. I loved the most, the way that the first three songs flow into each other. Overall a great album for 'alternative' music fans!"
2,"Cute, but Not Durable","My dogs love this toy. They are medium to small dogs. Anything I buy with stuffing, they have it out in 5-10 minutes. The squeaker didn't last long either. And during a tug-o-war, the tail was off almost immediately. So if your dogs are rough with their toys, don't purchase this product."
3,They like it...,"My dogs really like this chipmunk, but right away they broke the squeaker, and then a few days later they ripped off the tail. They still like playing with it though. It's very cute and a good purchase even with the negatives."
1,Greatest Garbage,"Lil Romeo is one of the absolute worst rappers to ever pick up a mike. His voice is annoying, his rhymes are lame, his beats are dull, and his topics are juvenile. This is someone who raps about girls giving him ""cooties"" and the only fans he's got are little kids and teenyboppers who think that D4L are the greatest thing to happen to rap since NWA. Please avoid this and go pick up Snoop or Nas's new albums instead."
3,Decent book,"This is a decent history of Camp Roberts. My father wrote one of the first history books of Camp Roberts, and it seems much of the material in this book was lifted from his book. My father was not acknowledged at all. Our family was a bit upset at first but realized that at least the work has gotten the word out about this treasure of military history. Worth reading. Better to visit the museum or the museum page and experience it first hand."
2,"It works, but only for a while","The water tastes quite good, but after a while of using it, the cartridge started leaking little black be-be shaped particles. This got into the reservoir of the tank and is taking a lot of work to clean. If you use this product, be careful."
1,"So bad, I can't read it...","I'm an engineer; I'm used to reading bad prose. I'm used to dealing with technical people deficient in people skills, but I just can't get past more than a few paragraphs in this book. I'll probably give it another try when I'm feeling more masochistic, but for now this book will be sitting on the shelf. If you have a low tolerance for badly written, egocentric self aggrandizement, then give this piece of work a wide berth."
2,"Intresting stories about Jeeps, but rather poorly written...","I bought this book specifically for the chapters about the author's work at Jeep, developing the XJ, TJ and WJ. As something as a Jeep fan, I found the some of the details of the creation and development of these vehicles rather interesting.Unfortunately, the whole book could have used a lot more proofreading and editing. It seems like the author's thoughts are sometimes not nearly as well organized as they can be. He often adds sentences that really don't add anything, like telling me that I was supposed to find the next paragraph about front suspension of the Jeep Cherokee somehow uninteresting. There is some good content in here, if you go fishing for it. It's just a little too hard find and read."
1,Are you blind???,"I truly hope you all did this on purpose, otherwise I will be very impressed that so many people made the same mistake.This novel is a romantic novel written by Barbara Cartland, and all the reviews below are about the Hellblazer books! Thank you for sharing your thoughts, but I believe they would be more appreciated under the right category and true book listing.About this book, I have no idea what this is about as I have never read it before, but at least I won't lie to the people that is actually looking for information about it."
2,"Haunted again, Revenge, again","Not one of the better Constantine tales; this time out Constantine is out to get a fellow magician who destroyed an old girlfriend, by way of Aleister Crowley's ""Scarlet Woman."" With rather stiff art by John Higgins, this standard tale of vengeance is only enhanced by Ellis's glimpses of the down and dirty side of London. Perhaps this is the actual reason for the story; it gives Ellis the option to wax poetic. If so, it's too bad he couldn't have attached it to a more compelling story."
4,BEST BUY MIXED UP,"I purchased the Best Buy version and had the same problem. I purchased the regular version at Circuit City. Disc One had 17 tracks including the 6 exclusive songs and Disc Two had the original 14 tracks. Another error is that on the Best Buy version, Disc One: Track #8 Let Me Ride (Entended Version) is actually the original Let Me Ride taken from Dr. Dre's The Chronic album. If you purchased the regular version from a different store than you get the correct Track #7 Let Me Ride (Entended Version).I think it's a decent compilation. I would recommend it for all the new fans."
1,Best Buy Version,Best Buy has now recalled this for that very reason.(At least most of the stores in the bay area and Sacramento)
2,My mail list & addressbook,"It is not what it says on the packaging, I found it difficult to use, it is outdated, no help.Don't buy this product."
4,easy to use,"I have found this program easy to use but I have troube taking the time to enter all info needed. My fault, not the program."
2,Wasted my time,"I experienced some compatibility issues with this software and I have a Windows OS. Data was simple to enter however, days later when I actually needed the information I was unable to open the file I saved. Need additional gadgets."
4,My MailList Review,"The My MailList was just what I wanted, a self-contained program that did just that. It worked as I had hoped, so I was completely satisfied. This way I could recommend it to others who did not want to spend a lot to get a much larger program that did perhaps a lot more, but things that they did not want."
1,my list,I was so glad to find this at Amazon as I had been looking for this program in an updated version for me new computer. I was using this on my old computer and liked the way you entered your information. It was easy for someone like me to use as it is hard for me at seventy years old to change how I do things now. Thanks for carrying a wide variety of programs old and new for computers.
1,hard to use do not buy it,It very hard to use; have buy more upgrades to use it; it not worth the $4.00' I have just put in the closet; well never buy any CD again at that price; DO NOT BUYMy MailList & Address Book
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM,This program will not run on Vista and they will not take it back after opening.
5,perfect for me,I was replacing this item after my computer crashed-I had been using an older version for a long time. It worked great for me.
4,Another fantastic SoTN-type game,"If you're a fan of the series, you have to get it. Period. If you aren't, you should consider it. The gameplay is addictive, the art is good, and the castle remains fun to explore time after time to complete your ""soul collection"" and find secrets.The one drawback is that you may be confused about the storyline if you haven't played the predecessors to this game; indeed, the storyline is the one area I'm a little bit disappointed in. The sequential quality of the it can lead to a feeling of having ""missed something"" if you haven't been keeping up with the series.All in all, a good game for fans and a good buy for someone looking for something a little different to play for a week."
4,Good game,Castlevania was a great game. It made a couple plane trips and car rides much easier. The graphics are good and gameplay is fun. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because after beating it i really have no desire to play it again.
4,Review From A Castlevania Fan.,"A fine addition to the Castlevania series, although the touch screen control feels tacked-on, and I'm not particularly fond of the Anime-look."
4,Sorrow,In castlevania dawn of sorrow you try to stop a cult from ressurecting a dark lord. the game is fun but collecting souls can be tedious and I think that the puzzles are not very challenging.
3,Helpful for a beginner,"I liked reading the recipes in this book. Many of the ingredients are not too difficult to find.The reason I only gave this book a 3 however is that it is not specific enough on storage. There is a little blurb on page 12 that talks about preferred message of storage. However, I wanted more specific details on storage and shelf life to be included with each recipe. This kind of thing is important for novices to know so they know how much of certain ingredients is ""safe"" to purchase at any given time."
5,Recipes for Natural Beauty: 100 Homemade Treatments for Radiant Beauty,"This book covers recipes for skin, hair, hands, feet, eyes, massage and diet. Recipes are simple which include herbs that I grow in my garden or essential oils that are easily found in my local heath store."
2,There are better comps out there than this one,"I don't know who this Saint Thomas guy is, but dedicating a compilation of music to Italy's version of Eva Braun makes me guess about his politics and possible racist motives. The artists represented don't seem to contribute to this questionalbe dedication (none of the songs appear to be written about her), but just seemed to be dropped in at random with no flow or feel to the disc at all. There are actually a couple of nice tunes on here, but alot of ""been there done that"" but done better by others before them."
1,Not the version I wanted,"I was looking for the abridged version of the Maude translation, and had googled that with the editor's name (Ernest J. Simmons). I prefer that version to the full book, which in my opinion is bloated with meandering ruminations on history that detract from the brilliance of the narrative. Anyway, this book came up as a match when I googled for the abridged version, and I guess I didn't read the fine print closely enough, but when it arrived and it was the three-inch-thick doorstopper (which I already own in hardback), I realized I'd just wasted eight bucks.Oh well. I don't entirely blame the seller, since as I said I didn't double- and triple-check thoroughly enough, but Amazon requested a review (twice), so here it is. Caveat emptor. Just checked it again, and the problem is that when you Google ""war and peace abridged,"" you get an Amazon page simply for War and Peace, and there's no longer any mention of the abridge version."
1,"Don't buy this book, just use common sense.","I agree with another review posted above-- don't waste your money on this book. I was looking for concrete, real things to do with my preschooler. The book suggests things like keeping a candle on your table and lighting it, then blowing it out, after each child says a prayer before every meal. I can't see how that's sharing the Catholic faith, nor does it seem practical. It also suggests things like taking your child to church, teaching them the sign of the cross, and praying with them.... all of which are common sense to most parents."
4,Wonderful resource for preschoolers,I searched and searched for concrete ideas to implement with my little ones. I am so glad I found this book! The author gives actual ideas you use right away. I find myself returning to this book time and again to reread it in it's entirety or to peruse a particular section for ideas. I implemented ideas a little at a time so as to not overwhelm the kids or me. This book has especially helped with my children's lenten practices. I highly recommend this book.
2,Lavishly produced but not particularly engaging,"At a risk of a beating, Drums Along the Mohawk is one of those occasional much-beloved John Ford films that didn't really work for me. As with My Darling Clementine, Ford is much more interested in the ephemera - rituals, gatherings, minor supporting characters - than he is in story or his rather bland leads (Claudette Colbert and a dull Henry Fonda on autopilot, as he is in many of his films for Ford), and much of the humor seems particularly misplaced here, turning the burning of the widow's farm or even the burning alive of one settler into semi-comic moments. The final chase is beautifully shot, but for all Ford's efforts to establish a sense of community worth fighting for, it's hard to care.The original trailer is included."
5,Drums Along The Mohawk,"A classic! A bit Hollywoodish, but a great film nonetheless. I love and highly recommend this one."
5,Lovin Henry Fonda,"Well, being a great fan of Mr.Fonda since I was very young, it was great to get one of his older movies to watch on DVD.Drums is a typically well done John Ford story with all the story sidebars and characters you can later regognize as the Ford ""people"", even a rather young Ward Bond.This movie was based on a book of the same title, and is good enough to make you want to read the book, just like the movie versoin of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" does."
4,Father's present,"This movie is wonderful for a western/indian type of movie. I'm not sure if it was part of a true story, but definitely entertaining for all ages."
2,Really Expected More,"With the likes of Henry Fonda and the always-funny Edna May Oliver, I rented this one for my wife & me to watch with hopes of great enjoyment (we both like American history). From all the 5-star reviews, I thought our chances were good. It wasn't terrible by any means, but overall I was disappointed.Edna May was great fun, but I felt Fonda never really meshed w/the part (as he did so well in The Grapes of Wrath and Fort Apache). Claudette Colbert just didn't do much for me either. As for the movie itself, I kept waiting for it to really hit its stride, but it never quite did. Interesting that many folks feel otherwise."
3,very good service,tv is excellant and was delvered in good shape. neil diamond songs (cd) was not good. other cd's were okey
3,Average swashbuckler drama with some great cienematography,"Drums Along the Mohawk is a period adventure film made in 1939, directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert.The plot invloves a newly-wed couple named Gilbert and Magdelana and their struggles to establish a homestead in America due to the continual raides of the Indians employed by the British.Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert give decent, but not exceptional performances in the lead roles. Edna May Oliver is the eccentric but good-hearted landlady Mrs. McKlennar. She pulls off her kooky antics and witty comebacks well considering that most of the best lines are given to her.Other special features include some brilliantly directed battle sequences and drop dead gorgeous cienematography which had the misfortune of being nominated for an oscar the same year as Gone With the Wind.All in all, this is a good, solid example of a period swashbuckler and I enjoyed it--just not up to the point of rapture."
4,"I may be being cynical, but...","taken as a purely Hollywood offering of partial facts blurred into a fantasy, with more than a few half truths sprinkled throughout; just sit back & enjoy a good story.However note just when this movie was made; & pay heed to the underlying tones about the cuddly Germans & the dastardly British!You just have to wonder how much of whose agenda is there, & why?"
2,Entertaining but beyond its years,The movie was entertaining but there are better movies of the era (Northwest Passage) or new films (Last of the Mohicans and Patriot). The film and plot is fair but not one of my favorites.
1,Going Against The Grain,"I thought this movie was horrible! Don't get me wrong, the acting was very good and if I would not have read the book it would have been a great movie, except I did read the book. This movie butchered the novel and I was very dissapointed. I see no reason to even make a movie after a classic story if you are not willing to completely follow it. If you only want a main storyline, without the correct ending, with no emotional details and personal problems...then this movie is for you. Otherwise be happy with your own imagination and read the book alone."
3,A perfect example of negative stereotyping!!,Drums Along the Mohawk is a perfect example of films of that era that paid no attention to history and created and reenforced negative stereotypes about American Indian people. I use this film in my American Indians in Film class as an example of how inaccuracies and negative perceptions of American Indian people were created.
2,just a little outdated,"Henry Fonda is one of my favorite actors, but his performance in this movie is very lacking. Seems to be in a constant depression through the whole movie. And the acting overall is subpar, like they were just reading lines. Ward Bond is the standout of them all for his small role. The history takes a back seat to the action. And, there is no felt connection between Fonda and Claudette, especially after he slaps her at the beginning of the movie for being a distraught woman. I would not recommend the movie."
4,Brilliant restoration,"Fox did a brilliant job in restoring Drums Along the Mohawk for DVD, with one small, annoying exception ... the 20th Century Fox trademark is from a much later era, perhaps the 1960s or 1970s. They also did this with the DVD restoration for Leave Her to Heaven. It would have been simple enough to use the original."
2,"""Drums"" Pound a Shallow Beat","Not much of a fan of John Ford. After viewing Drums Along the Mohawk it didn't change my opinion. Still don't know why some film buffs hail Ford as the demigod of the western genre. Drums Along the Mohawk is filled with melodramatic dialog, sub par acting by Henry Fonda and Colbert, and poor camera work that didn't utilize the sprawling greenery and hilltops that beautify upstate New York. Colbert wears way too much eye makeup and doesn't look like a frontier woman living in the 1700's. Ford gratuitously places his friend Ward Bond in a supporting role, but it is Edna May Oliver who steals every frame that Ford allows her to be in. The sappy soundtrack is misplaced, more suited to the silent film era and not much historical realism is used to legitimize the struggle among settlers, British loyalists, and Native Indians during the 1700's."
3,Drums Along the Mohawk,"Drums Along the Mohawk is very entertaining movie with excellent cinematography, but alas it is somewhat dated, and the portrayal of Indians in particular leaves much to be desired. It would seem that the inspiration for Blue Back (played by Chief Big Tree) was Buckwheat from The Little Rascals. I couldn't help but cringe each time he was in a scene. It's a shame that such portrayals were once deemed acceptable. Aside from this, however, the movie does have its merits and is worth seeing if you're into historical films."
5,HISTORICAL ADVENTURE COMES TO LIFE,"Apple-cheeked Claubert and tall and gangly Fonda are so young, they're a pleasure to watch. All performances, including Ward Bond and Edna May Oliver, are exceptional and the color is amazing. ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" is an epic of the frontier that you'll want to watch again and again. Although the film takes place in upper New York State, viewing the terrain, it was probably shot in northern California. No matter. The film begins with hope alive and better things to come yet is dashed by the realities of the frontier and war. Battle scenes between indians and settlers can be a little frightening so I'd recommend that if you're going to let small children see this, an adult should sit with the child. A perfect film."
4,Drums Along the Mohawk,"This is the original version, strongly remembered from my childhood. I had watched a remake some time ago, disappointed in it. Now, I have the one I recall."
4,Pioneering Eastern USA,"This movie endures well, partly because it is historical, and therefore not subject to obsolescence, other than technical obsolescence - due to changes in filming techniques. These are not significant.In its day, ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" was Academy Award material. Perhaps it would still be so.I get caught in the drama, the danger, the excitement and the unbelievable hardships of the pioneers, especially the women. This movie tends to bring out all of those aspects of pioneer life, and because I am drawn in, I get a strong feeling of participation, even though I am sure I don't have the heart to be a true pioneer."
4,Music from the golden age of the American cocktail party.,"In the ""exotic"" fifties, Americans launched a love affair with Afro-Cuban, Caribbean and Latin rhythms. Witness the wild popularity of the samba, the merengue and the cha-cha in the fifties and early sixties. Les Baxter's ""Quiet Village"" LP, issued in the late 50's, delivered a crisp electronically-enhanced interpretation of ""jungle"" music, full of simple melodic lines punched out on Baxter's electric piano and myriad percussion riffs echoing in the background. He also produced an all-percussion album during this period featuring his version of African drum songs. This ""best-of"" album is an entertaining and melodically pleasing throwback to an era when fun at mom and dad's house included Les Baxter, Percy Faith and Kai Windig on the turntable and Cuba libres in the tumbler."
5,A Fantasy World Atlas Set to Music!,"I became introduced to Les Baxter's work through Capitol's Ultra Lounge series, and found myself clamoring for albums of just his work. This 2 CD set more than fills the need. Baxter was an extremely gifted arranger, and the songs on this album are a testament to his talents. Nearly four dozen songs transport the listener around the world that many of us grew up fantasizing about: forbidden jungle temples; Oriental dens of magic; lost cities steeped in mystery and ripe with priceless treasures. Les Baxter manages to capture the essence, if not the actual facts, of the world's most exotic locales. I'm willing to bet more than one Peace Corps volunteer in the early 1960's was inspired to visit Africa or Asia with the rhythms of a Les Baxter soundtrack reverberating in his brain. Martin Denny may have become more famous as a purveyor of Exotica, but Les Baxter pioneered this form of music and planted his Tiki-covered flag at the summit!"
5,Don't miss the books on tape!,"I hate to read... too time consuming. My comute allows me a few hours a day to ""read."" I have fallen in love with fiction...and have thoroughly enjoyed every adventure...every chapter...every word of this series. Gratefully, the books on tape are abridged, and read by the author. Wow... I LOVED IT!"
5,My favorite book!,I'm a pretty picky reader. But This I could like. It's full of suspense and conflicts. I loved that book so much!I wish it never ended.
1,Pure unadulterated mormon pablum,"I tried to read this book and found it incredibly boring as it is nothing but fiction about fictional groups, like the nephites, who never existed except in the mind of Joseph Smith. It is short and simple Mormon propaganda. Read the book of Mormon for more propaganda."
5,Read or listen to these books!,"I have read or listend to all of Heimerdinger's books, except for his latest relese The Golden Crown. I realy injoyed these books. I think people of all ages would enjoy these books."
5,Love the whole series,"LOVE this series! The Book of Mormon takes on a hold new light. Amazing read the whole series never gets old. Adventure, romance, spirituality! I would recommend these to 12 and up because of the violence."
4,Preparing For The NYS Real Estate Salesperson Licencing Exam,"This text on the material necessary to pass the New York State Real Estate Salespersons Exam does that and much more,It is an up to date practicum on recent developmentsin the real estate field in both downstate and upstatemarkets.Additionally, It is structured in two parts, saving thosewho eventually sit for the Brokers exam the need toaquire a second exam review text..Finally,the book has a particularly detailed formatconcerned with ever changing legal forms necessaryfor salespersons to be conversant with attorneys whoare an intricant part of the realty world.."
1,poor,I was disappointed with how dirty the book was. I had to remove a dead insect from one of the chapters.
1,Buy it if you want a ton of spam,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this pull. It is very nice and the quality is what you would expect from Amerock. But... if you buy from Woodworkers Hardware through Amazon, you will get a ton of spam from them (WWH) annoucing evry little special they have. In fact, they send each email to you twice.And though there is a link on every page to opt out of the spam, it is useless. You click on it and indicate your email address and your request to opt out, but the emails continue. I've opted out of every email for 6 months and they still keep coming.Your best bet is to order by phone and do not give them your email address!"
4,Fun and pretty rainbows,"I bought this toy for my daughter for her 6th birthday. She loves the rainbow swirls and curlicues it makes. It does requires some adult supervision, and occasionally some intervention -- to ensure that everything doesn't devolve into brown -- but overall it's a fun concept and a good price. Would make a great birthday gift for an artistically inclined 6-8 year-old."
3,"Good, but with flaws","I've had this printer for a few years now. The good thing about it is that the print quality looks good and that it still works today. The bad thing is that it suffers from multifeeding.After the first year, the printer started to multifeed, getting all greedy with the paper. However, I've come to expect this of printers with the paper feed in the upright position. HP was offering some free quick fix for the problem on their website. So I ordered the paper thing and it fixed a lot of the feeding problems. Now it hardly multifeeds.Overall its a good printer, but be warned that you'll be personally feeding it one sheet at a time after a year or so."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!,"Too bad I can't give this product zero stars. The HP 1100 has a serious design problem with its paper feed which HP tried to cover up with a Mickey Mouse ""repair kit"". HP was sued for ignoring the paper feed problem, and lost in court. The repair kit ""solution"" lasted for about 2 weeks for me before the feed problem began again. Most recently, the stupid thing will not print unless it is turned off and on again. (There is no on/off switch by the way. You have to pull the plug!)DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS POORLY DESIGNED AND ENGINEERED PRODUCT which HP will not backup. I am throwing mine away and buying aBrother."
1,Great start...poor finish,"I bought three of these printers about a year ago for office and home. Great concept, nice print quality. Now, 12 months later, all three are worthless, as all three have paper feed problems, grabbing more than one sheet and consequently jamming. HP support is NON-EXISTENT. Stay away from this dog!"
1,Truly awful paper feed,"This printer has to have one of the worst automatic paper feeds I've ever encountered. I use two HP 1100 printers in my lab at work, and both exhibit the same terrible feed problems.They continuously suck in multilple sheets when printing, jamming on a regular daily, if not hourly basis. These printers require a full paper feed at all times to minimise this problem. These will not feed correctly with anything less than a half full paper rack. When printing, blank pages can often be found amongst your documents. And the pitifully small feeder means that you cannot perform anything larger than a 20 page print job with encountering serious jams...In summation, do not buy this printer, it will drive you insane."
2,Too new to warrant extensive repairs.,"Bought it two years ago, and only used it summers May - September. Last September the heating element wore out, and I need to pay half the price of the printer for a new element. I did like the footprint, the speed and the quality of the print before the machine died. I hated the small paper feed and the special parallel cord."
2,Terrible Reliability!,"I would not recommend this printer if you value reliability. I've had mine for about one year and the thing behaves terribly. I am still on my first toner cartridge, so I'm not using it excessively. It jams continuously in the sheet feeder area and is just plain aweful."
1,Avoid --paper jams galore,"...P>I've owned two of these HP laser doorstops (1100 and 1100se), and I can tell you I'll never buy HP printers again. BOTH printers, after some use (6 months to a year) pull multiple sheets of paper through themselves, thereby jamming the machines. The result is that my parents and I both have to manually feed one sheet at a time through them. Have tried different papers, loading different amounts, etc. Nothing works. I complained to HP and got a generic 'reload the paper' reply. NOT recommended. I now have an NEC Superscript 1450, and love it. No more jams!!!"
5,"Clean Copies, Dependable Printer","Been using this printer in a small office for over a year. After 1 month, it performed so well we purchased another. Both have been maintenance free and consistently produced clean copies. We print anywhere from 50 to 800 pages in a given day and have had no problems. A good laser printer for the money."
3,Jammin',"I have two. They both began jamming repeatedly after about a year or so. All the HP advice regarding a fix doesn't work. So-- they look good, they are fast enough, and they jam."
1,Paper Feed Problems - Absolutely Terrible,"As with many other reviewers, I have incurable paper feed problems and HP support is, as has become the norm these days, non-existent. For a while, I wasted my money on HP LaserJet paper, but found the cheap stuff misfeeds just as well as the good stuff. I even procured a copy of the service manual, replaced the feed roller and separator pads, etc. Good print quality for the price, but having to feed one page into the input tray at a time makes this unit worthless."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,I ordered this for someone else that likes solitaire...turned out not to be so great. He only found a couple of games worth playing.
5,I appreciate it for what it is,"Again, like the Origins of Animation, I read the negative hype and bought it anyway. For a student, like me, this is a very convenient way of getting the content. It is at least a buy from a reseller."
4,Glynn's impressions,This devotional book made me respect the author. He was deeply brave and honest.He was able to allow his sins and failures to be publicly exposed for all to see.In spite of his defects he was a rigorously honest man.This book also gave me a deeper insightinto how to understand God.
4,Not as bad as all that!,"This has ended up being fun for my 5 year old, but it requires some work on my part. There is some warm up time for the melter (8 min) and I wait 5 minutes (instead of 3) after I add the chocolate chips before pushing into the molds. This is no big deal- children should learn to be patient and wait for the payoff. The chocolates actually come out pretty. We made four molds worth (16 candies)fairly quickly. Two things would have made it better: having it plug in instead of using batteries, and having the plunger part come out for cleaning without having to unscrew it from the base. You have to use a phillips screwdriver to remove that part of the unit for cleaning. So it requires some work but my daughter really liked it and we gave the candies to Grandma as a gift."
3,tough to clean and not really worth it,"I made the chocolates with my 9 year old, he enjoyed it and they came out pretty good. But taking a toy apart with a phillips screwdriver to clean it is ridiculous. I agree - I'd just as soon have bought the molds and just melt the chocolate on the stove. My son doesn't want to do this - he enjoyed using the plunger and all that."
1,Broke After First Use,My son picked this out because making chocolates sounded fun to him. It wasn't too hard to operate and it worked fairly well but when we tried to use it the next night it wouldn't work anymore. We put new batteries in it and it wouldn't even warm up.
1,hershey candy maker is the PIT,This toy is unsanitarythe little tube where the chips gocannot be cleaned properlythe item cannot be submerged in waterso one use and its the garbage for it!!!lets face itall you have to do is get a bowl melt chocolateand place in candy traysthis toy is unnecesary
2,Melt in the microwave,"My daughters had this toy; it has since been pitched. It was frustrating for them to operate. We found that if I melt chocolate chips in the microwave and still use the molds from the toy, it works out much better for us. I wish Mattel would bring back the Sweet Toot tootsie roll roll maker from the 60's. No batteries were involved or heating elements. Cute little tootsie roll molded candy was made by ""kid power"". I would skip the Hershey's maker and wait for something better."
2,Looks better than it is..,"This is a good idea, but the product isn't that great. I really thought that it didn't warm up enough to really melt the chocolate. It kind of just makes the chocolate squishy, so you kind of have to push it into the molds (almost toothpaste consistency). The cleaning is a PAIN, and it got REALLY hot, even when I didn't use it for very long. I wouldn't recommend it unless you were only going to use it once, and even then I don't think it's worth the money. Kind of a disappointment overall."
2,Slang too hard to comprehend,"I first read Thunder City, as recommended by a friend who is an avid reader of Estleman, and enjoyed it thoroughly. However, I found the slang and lingo of the era in this book to be so difficult as to distract me from the storyline. Wish I could remember some of the words, but the book has gone back to the library. The only term I think I translated correctly is the one used for cops. Can anyone help me with a ""key"" to these words so I can give the book a second try? Would prefer an answer via email: dhanover12@comcast.net"
1,"A joke, RIGHT???","I reviewed this previously, but for some reason it hasn't shown up yet. So I'll try again: this is a joke RIGHT?? A ""hillbilly"" tribute to AC/DC? Bon Scott has to be spinning in his grave!!"
3,Needs better indexing,This book needs to be indexed by:* lead time for response* months during which publisher reads* compensation* other standard bits that are included in each entry
2,"Movie was OK, But Only for Seeing Once","Movie drug a little and the message was not exactly scriptural (unless you believe that water baptist actually saves anyone's soul). The movie just ended without any real ending (like they ran out of film). Characters were introduced and never developed. Some characters did not seem to have any purpose to moving the story along.It was ok to see once as a family film, but I would probably not ever see it again. It would be better to rent this movie than to buy it as I did."
2,disappointing,"Professional cinematography is lacking in this movie along with a not well tied together story line. A lot of video shots were right in the face of the people speaking and some shots looked liked the camera was sitting on a table while the people spoke. The title is misleading too; other than the main character occasionally visiting the river which impacted his father, I could not figure out any other meaning to the river within. I would describe this movie as a 2nd rate, family movie and really cannot recommend it."
4,It is too large for any unit that I have had experience with. Order the small.,"I like it but I wish I had ordered the small size. The medium is way too big for my two guitar units, both Line 6. It does cinch up enough to hold them well though, just have to tuck the extra cross strap back behind again."
1,does not serve the purpose intended,PLease be aware that the two holes that can be seen at the back of the holder cannot fit unto most standard guitar straps. They are in fact too small. You will have to find other means of getting this holder fastened unto your guitar strap. Very poorly designed
1,Dallas,I ordered these chocolate covered coffee beans for gifts ( I ordered 6 packages)...they came completely melted/ the box was hot and contained only one cold pack...it was all ruined. I have contacted the company for a replacement or refund..total waste
2,Disappointed.,"I recieved these as a brithday gift. I was really excited because I love chocolate covered coffee beans, and I received 6 bags. After eating a few, though, I'm disappointed. The chocolate is good but it's a moot point if the beans are too hard. They don't have a good coffee flavor, because you can't chew them up. And your mouth and teeth are left with little bean shards to finish."
1,Improper Shipping- Arrived Melted!,"Chocolate is first quality, but what good is it to receive a big glob of chocolate goo after paying for the product and shipping? They need to fix their shipping in a bad way. They shipped from Miami to Pensacola with no dry ice and no insulation. Express delivery will not save improperly packaged food stuff that is temperature sensitive."
5,Great game for 5 and 6 year olds,"What a great game boy advance game! We searched high and low for something my 5 year old could play on his game boy that wouldn't frustrate him...this game fits the bill perfectly! He is a rescue hero fan, which makes this game even more fun! It's challenging enough to interest him, his 6 year old brother and even me, his mom, yet it's simple enough that he can get through the levels and feel a sense of accomplishment. I would highly recommend this game for the younger set of game boy players! It's really fun!"
4,GREAT FUN!!,We got my 5 yr old son this game for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!!! He would have played the game 24 hrs a day if we allowed him to. He has completed the game entirely since Christmas but still loves to play the game again and again. He is a HUGE Rescue Hero fan and has been for a couple years and I don't think he'll ever tire of playing this game.
1,Did not fit drill when it arrived...,"This item didn't fit the drill when it arrived. But the way it didn't fit was minor, so I ground the plastic to fit. 2 weeks later, the battery stopped taking a charge. Since I'd ground off parts of it, I didn't feel like I could return it.Very unhappy."
3,fun at times,"This book didn't do that much for me, but I definately do not think that it is a waste of time. Johnny's friend was annoying when he kept saying 'baby'. I know that the setting is in the 1950's but it's such a cliche. This is a fun read for 9-12 year olds."
3,Luck always happens when they most need it,"The characters in this book are Frederick, Johnny and the Professor. This book begins with Johnny noticing the Professor is acting strangely, and he finds out the Professor has a trolley that can go back and forward through time. I had little enthusiasm for this book because the plot changes rapidly and much of the book 'just happens to be so', luck happens when they most need it, which stops them from using clever solutions for their problems."
4,Good Book,When Johnny and Professor Childermass find a trolley in the professors basement they go inside and pull on levers and soon they travel back in time
3,Imak Gloves,I have been wearing these gloves for a few years now and I like them however they are not very durable. I have gone through quite a few of them.. I wear them every day all day. The material on them should be a bit stronger.
3,Rarely worn,"The glove gives moderate support in palm and wrist area, nowhere near the amount of support received from a wrist wrap.However,not only is the finger section far too long and unnecessary for my needs, it's relatively tighter than the lower section and restricts circulation to the fingers, so the gloves can only be worn short periods."
5,good product,gloves are comfortable and actually help prevent pain from repetitive use while working on my PC or playing on my tablet. Highly recommend this product
2,"They fit nice, but did not do anything","The thing I was worried about was the fit. They fit just fine, but they really did not do anything to relieve my pain. I wore them off and on for a week on one hand and tried something different on the other. Same results. No improvement."
4,Knitter - finger pain,"I have a ""trigger"" finger from over use - knitting too much at a time. The compression of the gloves on the fingers doesgive a bit of relief."
1,Broke after three weeks,"The gloves were pretty much perfect for what I bought them for until they broke. They allowed me to type at a keyboard without my hands becoming cold. After three weeks, however, one of the seams completely came apart making the gloves unwearable. Pretty unacceptable. I wasn't being particularly hard on them either."
4,Gloves Review,I just got these gloves and was hesitant on wearing them. but after i put them on and wore them for awhile i got used to them. I like these gloves they are snug and so far feel like they are working.The only complaint i have is my pair has a seem in the forefinger of my left glove that has been stitched Wrong its not too bad. I WISH THEY HAD A PAIR THAT WAS BLACK. otherwise they are good gloves.
5,Good Gloves,The gloves fit very well and help keep my fingers warm and working. They help with arthritic joint pain. Good value
4,Warm at last,I type in an environment that is really cold. Theses gloves let me type while keeping most of my hands and fingers warm. Just what I neded!
5,Life saver,"These gloves offer the support and extra warmth that helps arthritic hands and wrists without being too tight. I would love to see them in ""fashion"" colors so that they would be less noticable in public. Also, very fast service from vendor!"
1,Poor quality - No Compression,"This glove has NO compression...Poor quality, sewing very poor. Poorly constructed. See Active Glove review (which is Excellent). Would like to exchange for 'Active Glove"" and pay difference.Ordered ""Active Glove"" by same manufacturer, same size. Quality superior and excellent construction quality."
5,Precisely fits my needs,"They may be marketed as gloves for arthritis, but they are wonderful for other things. I am diabetic, and have always struggled with extremity temperatures, especially while at the computer. As a developer, cold hands just slow me down, and these gloves have mitigated that significantly.My hands do still get cold. You can't perfectly control temperature with anything. However, they stay warm when I need them to, and were comfortable enough to sleep in all night. Also, if you work with capacitive touchscreens, these are the only way I've found to keep hands warm and still be effective.These will not be my last pair.Also, some reviews mentioned that the gloves had the grip bumps--I believe that individual erroneously received their active wear product and not these gloves. What I received are exactly as pictured."
1,not what is advertised!,"These are not compression gloves by any ""stretch"". They are simply grey cloth fashion gloves made for gripping something. Yes gripping! They have little rubber bumps all over the palm to prevent slipping, not at ALL like what the picture shows. The fingers are half this length, not even reaching the first joint on my small hands (and I ordered the small size and they did fit fine). But in short, these are not compression gloves...but gripping gloves. When I went to do my return the return ""requires special handling"" so I had to CALL customer support at amazon and they are happily allowing me to return this item and are tagging the issue. Please see my uploaded picture!"
2,disappointment,"I had so hoped they would be what I've needed, but after using them they developed holes in them. One at the stitching & the other at the edge between thumb & forefinger. I only use them for typing. I was very disappointed in the quality. Maybe I just got a defective pair, I don't know."
3,not bad for the money,"These gloves are OK, but they're no big deal. I thought they would feel a lot more supportive, but they just feel warm and snug. Thermoskin gloves are much more supporting. The disadvantage of Thermoskin is the unnatural feel of the fabric. I ordered these gloves because they looked more breatheable, which they are, so they will probably stay cleaner and less sweaty. However, they just give a modest amount of support."
2,Seams unravel,"Unfortunately, the seams at the thumb have unraveled, and no amount of mending has stopped the unravelling process. The results of wearing the gloves are positive, but the quality of the construction leaves room for improvement."
4,Compression Gloves,The compression gloves helped take away the pain in my thumbs. The gloves were very comfortable to wear. I am impressed with the product.
1,Not as described at all!!,"The gloves I received looked like a cheap imitation of the gloves shown - the fingers and wrist were shorter, there was rubber on the palms and they were made out of a polyester/cotton/spandex/pvc blend - not 95% cotton, 5% spandex as stated. They arrived in a celophane envelope and no other packaging, did not have the IMAK label, they are very thin and do not provide any compression or support at all. I ordered the small based on the IMAK website size quide and they are roomy. I don't understand the 5 star reviews this product has - they must have received something different because mine are a rip-off."
2,Returning mine,"This was the only set available from the resource at the time. I will continue my search. I've never considered my hands exceedingly small. There is little support, though the fabric is nice. I will definitely continue my search."
3,"Pretty good, but ripped thumb","These gloves are okay-- they would be ""great"", except the thumb portion ripped off on the first day of use. I still use them, but be aware that you need to remove them FROM THE WRIST, not by pulling on one of the fingers (which I think is a bit ridiculous, but whatever).I use them as moisturizing gloves after applying lotion, and I'm 27, so they're not just for arthritis. They keep in the lotion just as well as those white gloves you can find at Target / Walmart."
3,DOES THE JOB,"DOESN'T WORK IF YOUR ARTHRITIS IS REALLY BAD, BUT OTHERWISE IT NEEDS SOMETHING BETTER. ONE OF MY HANDS IT WORKS ON. THE OTHER IT DOESN'T."
4,Thin but warm,"I don't have arthritis so I can't say if they are good for that reason but I do use these on cold days to type on the keyboard, play video games, and to play on my tablet/phone. These gloves are super thin and feel almost like you don't have gloves on which was the main reason why I chose to go with these instead of other half finger gloves.Mine did tear a little after the first use. You have to be really careful putting these on since they are thin. Other than my own misfortune and mishandling of the gloves, they constructed well and should hold up."
4,Best Price & FM Sufferer Review,"At $13.99, this was the best price I could find on a pair of Compression Gloves anywhere.I have FM & bought them because even my fingers ache. They ache so much I will rub them, hard. I don't think the gloves take away the ache but it cuts it down enough that I don't feel the need to rub my fingers.They are comfortable & I can still type and do other tasks."
4,Arthritis Compression Gloves work great but just don't last long,I would give these a 5 if the stitching didn't tear up after a month or two and holes in the gloves as they are material gloves with simple stitching but they do work wonders and work great to wear them daily and while sleeping to alleviate the hand pain of arthritis as my pain had instant relief with the mild compression of these light weight close fitting snug gloves which felt so good against my hands and wrist so great product if they only would last a little longer :-)
3,look nice but not really compression type that I thought I was buying,I bought these hoping they would be more like compression type gloves. My hands swell at night and was hoping these would help. Even though I measured my hands as shown the gloves are a little too big to be compression type. They still work well in keeping my hands warm and I have worn them for that purpose as they dont look like medical type gloves. I would say to maybe order a size smaller
3,"Was not that compressive, and not good for severe arthritis","Hmm, the fingers are quite long if you don't have large hands, we purchased a medium. Also, only really functional for those who do not have severely deformed hands from arthritis. It just didn't work for my mum. So I now use it for general use, but found the length of the fingers rather long!"
3,Feel Great - But turn them inside-out,These gloves are comforting to painful joints and keep my hands at a nice temperature. I turned them inside-out as the seams dig in after awhile.
4,Imak Arthritis Gloves Large - 1 Pair,I purchased 3 pairs of these Imak Arthritis Gloves. I gave a pair to my mom and dad. They claim they now sleep through the night and wake up without pain in the fingers.
3,Arthritis gloves,"Light weight, snug fit, helped a little.Some stitching at fingertips starting to unravel."
4,Warm Hands -Less Pain,"I purchased these gloves because I have a medical condition that requires I keep my hands warm. Even though I live in Sunny So Cal, our office temperature is sometimes less than comfortable. These gloves keep my hands warm and still allow me to continue working at the computer. I haven't had them long enough to know how they will hold up, but so far, so good."
1,Not for cold hands.,Does not warm my hands one bit. In fact for some reasons with the gloves on my hands feel colder.
4,"Great for cold, typing hands","I bought a pair of these because after sitting in the basement at my computer all day my hands are FREEZING. These allow me to mouse and type with only a slight reduction in performance. I am able to roll the fingers up to allow for more freedom when typing if need be.I have tiny man-hands and I got the small so they would be snug, reducing interference with the keyboard. They stretch well and fit well. I wouldn't wear these for a snowball fight, but it's a nice compromise between warmth and freedom."
4,Do help some...,"These gloves help to alleviate some discomfort...unfortunately for me, they don't completely rid me of my pain. This is not due to the gloves just about the intensity of my arthritis. Give these gloves a try...I would rather have them on than off...that does say something."
5,perfect for keeping my hands warm in cold basement while typing,These gloves very comfortable and effective at keeping my hands warm. I wear them for 8 hours every day that I work. Ordering a second pair.
5,"so soft love them, makes my selling go down in my hands","I think this is a great buy, worth the money.I would recommmend these gloves to anyone who has problems with pain in their fingers or hands."
2,NO CHANGE!,"I have to sit at a computer all day typing, and I am also right handed. This has caused bad cramping in my hand and I've had to use arthiritis relief gels as well as gloves like this. This particular glove does not work for me. It's like having on winter gloves which are just for shielding out the cold. Would not purchase again, and think I waisted my money in purchasing it."
2,Good just for go to sleep.,It look ok but the quality is no good it broke easy when I wore it on my dayli activities.
2,Disappointed,"I tried these gloves and one other brand. Both were a disappointment. I am using an ointment that seems to work better. My hands feel better after exercise, but these gloves keep them stiff and don't allow enough movement."
2,Cheap gloves. Sort of work.,"So these gloves come rolled up in a small box. They came out of the box with tears in the seams and loose threads, and ultimately are extremely cheap gloves (though they are not priced as such). They fit well enough, and do assist in reducing pain somewhat, but they also cause sweaty palms and become hard to remove when slightly moist.Also, my friend remarked that they look like hobo gloves.I'll be wearing them until they rip more, and at that point, I'll probably try a different brand."
2,Meh,I really hoped these would be all that people said they would be but to be honest I didn't notice any difference. The fingers also were quite long. If you have long fingers that's great.
5,Great gloves,"The gloves cover most of my hands and joint and are comfortable. Nice arthritis relief, good for wearing many hours."
4,Arthritis Gloves,I purchased these when I found I could no longer take the medicine due to gastric issues...they have worked terrific and I have been recommending them to everyone!!.
4,Very Comfy!,These gloves are great! I only use them for sleeping and they keep my hands very warm. They are soft and I don't even know I'm wearing them!
1,Make Hands Cold (not warm),I needed these to keep my wrist and hand warm to relieve my pain. I found these gloves to get colder as I wore them.
5,Humongous/Infogames #1,"This is absolutely the best set of kids' computer games except for PuttPutt's Activity Pack (same company)! We have most of PuttPutt, Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam and Spy Fox, plus the soccer, baseball and football. Not only has my 6 year old been playing them successfully for 3 years, but the neighbor kids up to age 12 come over to play them as well (for the past 3 years). You can't go wrong with any of these products for kids not yet too sophisticated to demand interactive advanced graphics. These are the best, and entirely inoffensive."
4,great value for the money,"The viewsonic was simple to set up, picture quality was good, and the price was reasonable. Doesn't have all the bell's and whistle's associated with higher end t.v.'s but who cares. Don't have H/D so I can't comment on that aspect of the picture quality, but for a spare bedroom, which is where this is placed, it rocks!"
4,Viewsonic N2010 LCDTV,"Got it 2 days ago and love it .Picture quality is what we have been expected from 20"" lcd tv and sound is a pretty loud.This is what we were looking for our bedroom.ProsHDTV readyNTSC/PAL supportbuilt in TV turner16 ms response time ( no such effect as ghosting )Consposition of component (YPbPr), S-video, FR (antenna/cable) connectorsno 16:9no DVI/VGA connectors (Having Samsung 730b, I'm not planning to use it as a monitor)no PIP ( not a problem for us, never use this function on our other TVs)I'd recommend this TV to anyone who are looking for basic LCD TV with good picture quality and affordable price.Also, REBATE form for this LCD TV ,purchased between Nov, 1 - Dec 31, is available on [...]."
2,Battery for this phone impossible to find,I had this phone only about a year and already the battery is dying whats worse is i cant find the battery for this phone anywhere its rediculous i had an old vtech 900mhz that is discontinued and i never needed the battery replaced i talked for 7 hours straight on that one the vt2428 ill be lucky if i can get an hour where can i find this battery?
1,too much noise,Bought this phone and it has horrible reception. There is a constant hissing noise in the reception. Turn up the volume and the hissing drowns out the person on the other line....
1,Buy a better phone,"I bought this phone last year, and paid about $70, and I really regret it now. The caller ID display doesn't work anymore, so when we get phone calls, we have to try to figure out who's calling based on the few readable characters. Plus, the battery is constantly dying, so I have to switch to my corded phone when I make a long phone call.A minor annoyance has been that the caller id will read phone numbers as such (xxx) xxx-xxxx. Which is fine, but one of the functions of the phone is supposed to be calling back a number on the caller id. However, the phone doesn't know how to dial ""1"" before it dials the number, so the call never goes through. It displays the area code on local calls as well as long distance calls, so I've never been able to use this function."
1,Very Cheap!!!,"Yes, this is a cheap phone in many ways! I have had it since Aug. 2003. This has been our primary phone. The features are easy to use and I like the different ring tones for certain callers. It worked great For several months. Since then it will not hold a charge. If you are on the phone for more than 30 min. or if it is left off of the cradle for more than two hours it will go dead. I have had static lately and called the phone company they said it was the phone. From the other reviews I may have gotten a lemon, all I know is that I am anything but happy with it's performance."
2,VTEC review,"I have not been happy at all with the clarity of this particular phone. The battery has not ever worn down and people that I am talking with say I sound crystal clear, but there has never been one time that I haven't heard static. I live in a single family home and have no other electrical systems going that should interfere at all with it's performance. In fact, I am planning on returning this phone to the store where I got it."
1,ew,I hate this phone it always dies ofter days of charging also at this very moment it says no line so i am also looking for a new phone any time you see a vtech run away NOW they are all crap i had a clear purple phone it broke i thought that it was that one phone
1,Worst Battery Life Ever!,My mother and I have had this phone for maybe a year and a half. At first the bettery seemed fine. Now it goes out if you leave it off the hook for more then a few hours. Even when we got a replacement battery it still went out!I HATE THIS PHONE!
1,Save yourself some money!,"I had only heard good things about this brand until I purchased the phone and saw a different side. My husband and I purchased the phone from the extra money we received from our wedding. We have been disappointed ever since. We have had the phone for only 8 months and the battery life seems to only last 1 or 2 days max without being charged again. When we have charged it, by the end of the day we already need to recharge it. But I must admit that the frequency of it is great. But the quality of the phone is poor. If the date of return had not expired we would have taken it back to get our money back."
1,BEWARE OF THIS PHONE & V-TECH!!!!,Do not waste your money!!! I bought this phone in July. At first i was satisfied...Then I wasn't. First of all it was the reception and the voice volume. The reception was always static static static and the voice volume was terrible! Whenver you would talk you would hear your voice echo and you would hear a clicking sound. The ringers are annoying and terrible. But some people are saying that the battery life isn't long. I fully charged the battery and purposly left the phone off the charger for a battery life test. The battery lasted 6-7 days without being charged and was used constantly! I do not reccomend this phone at all!
2,It's just OK.,"Well, it works in that when I strap it to my guitar it helps to keep it steady. But it's not as hands free as I would have hoped. And it's also extremely uncomfortable- the leather digs into my neck and rubs uncomfortably against it. Would I recommend it? No. Do I use it? For lack of an alternative, yes."
4,Great Product,"Great product.I would give it a 5 if the ""collar"" was paddedAs advertised. Great price. Simple and efficient"
5,Very comfortable,"I could not find this product in my country, so I decided to buy it at AMAZON. The truth is very comfortable to play guitar standing up. I use it with my guitar and my Requinto and I feel very comfortable with him. What I would change the union to hook that is placed in the mouth of the guitar is very long if you use the Requinto."
2,JP Lizzy quality but not my favorite style,"I love JP Lizzy's totes and I think they are quality bags. They are practical and have a good designer look. With that said, I prefer the Mint Tote or the Strawberry Tote. This one didn't look as nice to me in person and I am going to return it for the Mint Tote."
5,Another Quality Book from Heritage Press,"This review relates to the 1939 Heritage Press edition...Heritage's Five Christmas Novels features a matte cinnabar slipcase and the Heritage ""house look"" for Dickens: textured barley cloth with decorative red rules, Dickens' intials, and a gilt spine emblem with raised letters.A Christmas Carol, The Chimes, The Cricket on the Hearth, The Battle of Life, and The Haunted Man.Illustrated with 8 color plates by Birch and black & white illustrations at each chapter heading.404 pp, decorative cloth over hardback boards with a sewn binding."
2,"Misleading title, uneven book","""Home Buying by the Experts--The Pros make your dream home a reality"" is a very misleading title of what is essentially a 'tips' book. Just like another reviewer mentioned, don't make this the only home buying book that you read. This is strickly supplimental information, not any way a walk-thru of the home buying process.The information provided is a mixed bag with eight contributors. Each author gives their favorite 'tips' for buying. There are a few good chapters on tax advanges & closing, and a lot of 'fluff' chapters on 'no money down' and 'moving'.The reason I bought the book was because Bob Bruss had a part in it and he has a great syndicated column in newspapers. His contribution was not enough to make ""Home Buying by the Experts"" worthwhile. I would advise to skip this one and buy 'Home Buying for Dummies""."
2,"Good initial performance, poor after less than a year","I purchased one of these eFilm/Delkin batteries in April 2005 (not from Amazon) as a replacement for the original NB-1L that came with my Canon S230.While it initally performed just fine, after less than a year of use it has degraded to the point where I get perhaps 40-50 shots on a single charge (screen on all the time, mixed use of flash). This is poor performance from a Li-Ion battery that's less than a year old, especially as the original 3 year-old Canon battery now has roughly the same performance.OK, so it was cheap to buy, but now I'm looking for a replacement less than a year later - the original price doesn't look so cheap any more.Overall, you're probably best avoiding this one."
1,Petsolutions worst seller ever !!!!!!!!,"I order this per there advertisment, only to find out, it is not what there selling, wouldn't even acknowlage there mistake, bad customer service rep, rude, cold, if it's from Petsolutions. stay away, buy from another vendor, there a joke !!"
5,"Beautiful picture book, excellent story!","This book comes with stickers! It is the first Mr. Lunch book I read, and I loved it so much I got all the other ones, too. Mr. Lunch should be a role model for all dogs."
5,A great read!,This is a wonderful book for the lay person and professional historian alike. It puts a new spin on understanding the Great Strike and brings the streets of 1877 back to life. I have given this book as a gift to friends as well as enjoyed it in college classes. I am already looking forward to the author's next book.
5,The Power of Lucifer,"Lucifer is still very powerful adversary even the very elect of God he will try to decieve them. The New World Order describes the capabilities of Lucifer such as healing of deseases,bringing back the dead to life and healing of wounds and he can even falsified a true miracles from God. But if a person is trully Born Again in the Spirit and has the Seal of God, he cannot decieve, only those who do not bear the Seal of God in their forehead that he can easily decieved them and these people who have the Seal of God are the Truimphant over all evil and darkness and the flesh and Lucifer knows that."
1,Horrrible toy,"I purchased this toy for Christmas for a grandchild..When I received it,I opened it to see what it contained because it was so light.Well it only had a plastic spin machine,paint and some small white paper.I returned it to Amazon,no trouble with that.I then purchased anothr one at Hobby Lobby,much cheaper and it had cards,paints, machine,envelopes,extra paper of two different colors.So I do not recommend this toy at all.Thanks"
3,it's ok,it's ok... not as good as the K&N air filter. but ok as an OEM replacement. doesn't really make a difference on the fuel or performance.
5,Exact fit for 2003 Infiniti QX4,It has more pleats than any other filters thus allowing more filtered air through.This will also fit Nissan Pathfinders too.
1,Beware: Not for some 2008 Imprezas,"As of Aug. 2012, the Amazon site showed this as compatible with a 2008 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport (2.5L SOHC, normally aspirated). It DOES NOT fit. Amazon's customer service is sending the correct filter (WIX 46914), and has said that they will correct the compatibility listing for this item. In the meantime, I'm adding this comment in the hopes that others avoid ordering the wrong part.Quick double check: If your car takes a square air filter, this is NOT the right part."
4,A very interesting book!,"I thought this was a great book. Granted I'm a French major, but I think history buffs and other people interested in cultural history would enjoy it as well. Darnton's writing is easy to digest and the subjects of his essays are always interesting. While some essays can be very academic in nature at times, on the whole this book is for everyone, regardless of whether or not they are in academia."
2,not so great,"A brief flipping through of this book will suggest it's loads of fun. Not really, though. The chapter on the Great Cat Massacre was the only real interesting one to me. The others (e.g. ""A Police Inspector Sorts His Files"") were actually kinda boring. Heck, even the cat massacre one was spoiled by a bunch of anthropological theorizing, whereas what I had wanted was a more straightforward recounting."
2,"Dull, pale color that doesn't last","I've been dying my hair every color under the sun for years. After hearing a friend rave about Manic Panic, I thought I'd give it a try. The color came out very flat, and was not rich or vibrant at all. And, it looked extremely washed-out after only two shampoos.To be fair, there are a lot of brightly-colored dye brands out there, and many others I've experimented with have been far worse. It's a challenge to find one that comes out vivid and shiny and actually stays for a few weeks. I would recommend Special Effects, instead."
2,WRONG colour,"The jar pictured here is NOT for green envy. It is a DARK green, not the neon and bright colour you would expect. This jar is ""Electric Lizard."""
1,SCAM!!! BEWARE BEFORE ORDERING!!!,"This item is being advertised as a ""Billet Aluminum Grill"". It is not the complete grill as the ad would lead you to believe. It is actually a grill ""Insert"" that fits inside the orginal grill frame. This review is for item # 40332 shown in the automotive section under grills and grill guards."
2,Very fine granules - nothing distinctive,"I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino). Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of ""sanding"" sugar."
3,It's actually pretty light,"Not super happy, as it appears light-ish blue on the white chocolate cake pops I made for a wedding, where the colors were ivory and royal blue. Maybe there's a darker shade I can find from another company..."
4,Tremendous stuff.,"The Lighthouse Family are a UK based twosome, whose hit includes ""Lifted"". They have since remixed this track, tinkered with its workings, and cleverly transformed it into songs that sound nothing like the original at all. Oh no.This 'best of...' collection is a CD single which nobody should be without. If you're big on variety, artistic integrity and good songs then it might not be for you, but as an object lesson in making the most of what you have, it can't be recommended enough."
2,Battle of Midway in Space,"BErserker Fury was a space version of the Battle of Midway, but the real battle was less confusing. Time seems to have no meaning, as your point of view changes in both time and space, like a bad Doctor Who movie. Sometimes I don't know what character I am reading about. I happen to be a great fan and even sent him e-mail once, but this book could of been A LOT better if somebody else had gone over it with a magic marker and helped him cut out parts that were not needed."
1,Sorry I bought this.,"I have hear good things about the berserker series and was hoping that the reviews were wrong. How *wrong* I was. This book is terrible. It is written in a detached, all-knowing, third-person perspective, with almost no character development.In fact you don't find out much of anything about the characters till the last 1/4 of the book. Nothing is ever explained, it reads like a bad enclyopedia. This book not even worth the shipping I paid for it."
1,"unbelievably turgid, slow, and weak.","Not vintage Sagerhagen. I read half, could not force myself to continue, and actually threw the book away! Kierkegaard is more readable and interesting."
2,Predictable and boring!,"I found that paralleling the battle sequence in the book with that of the WWII campaign at Midway made a large part of the story totally predictable and uninteresting. Even though Saberhagen made the excuse of showing how history can repeat itself, he made the battle too similar to Midway, including names, numbers and events. By the end of chapter 5, the parallel was obvious. After that, little remained in doubt as to the outcome of the story. The sub-plot comprising the stories of Nifty Gift and Jory Yokosuka just didn't have enough in it to carry the book on it's own. The only question that the book left me with was ""Did Saberhagen use Ernest Hemingway as his model for Jay Nash?"""
1,No fury here,"As a fan of Fred Saberhagen's works (namely the Book of Swords series), I found this book to be plodding, boring, uninspired, and a completely dull read. I was expecting a fast-paced book with lots of action, interesting characters, strong storyline, etc. I found none of these. I did not care about the characters, the action was uninteresting, the battle scenes had no emotion, and the story (which could have been great) went nowhere. All in all, disappointing from start to finish."
1,A serious disappointment from a writer who knows better.,"I've read many of Saberhagen's books over the years, including his Berserker and Swords series, but ""Berserker Fury"" has to be his poorest effort ever. The Battle of Midway in space with poorly disguised names of the actual commanders involved. If it weren't an historical event involved, this would be outright plagiarism. Much of the actual writing was poor, as well. Shame on you, Fred! Could this have been one of those contractual obligation kind of things?"
1,Uncredited Rewrite of the Battle of Midway in SF Form,"I was very disapointed with this book as I have enjoyed previous titles in the Berserker series. However, the whole plot was a direct rip-off of the events surrounding the WWII battle between the US and Japanese fleets. No originality detected."
4,Without a Thought,"Relax, pitiful humans. You're a long way from a universe dominated by planet-sized killer robots raging for your blood. Humanity has a lot going for it; we robots can't wipe you out as long as you write such interesting books. Even though Saberhagen seemed to drag a bit in this outing, his Berserkers are still a fresh and original concept in the cluttered field of SF. Relax for now, humans...but keep your guard up."
2,"It's a Glossary, Not a Manual","This book is good for understanding various aspects of gay sex from the vanilla to the kinky to safety. The title is a bit deciving though. A manual implies it shows one how to have sex (such as ""The Ultimate Sex Book"" for heterosexuals).A lot of this stuff can be found by searching the internet on various sexual and health related sites out there.The book does go indepth with some topics giving graphic and visual descriptions of various acts that might help the novice, but a veteran to Gay sex would not really benefit from this book as will those who do not have access to the Internet to get this information."
2,Breaks no new ground. Look elsewhere,"A pretty dumbed down version of ""being gay."" Not so much a sexual manual, per se, as a handbook for those who need definitions of things like ""bars"" and ""genitals."" Breaks no new ground, and you;d be much better off with the better written, better illustrated, and more comprehensive ""New Joy of Gay Sex."""
3,Is the equivalent of Our Bodies Ourselves,When I was a kid my aunt gave me a copy of Our Bodies Ourselves and it explained all the trials of puberty for a boy in a very general manner. This book is good for the young gay teen that needs alot of questions answered in a non-threatening way. As an adult I would have preferred a hardcore Kama Sutra.
2,Its a dictionary,"This book i guess is a manual... but i would discribe it more as a dictionary. It summariz'z a word like testicals in one sentance and then talks about it in a few paragraphs. In my opinion Ultimate Gay Sex is a lot better than this book. Plus UGS has actuall photography to help get a better ideas, this book has some hand drawn pictures. Hope this helps."
3,"""Manual"" could be replaced with ""explanation""","I think the word ""manual"" should be replaced with the word ""explanation"". Not condemning the book itself, but just not to give someone the wrong idea about what they are getting or expecting. It is good for someone maybe coming out of the closet or really new to the scene. I can put myself back to the first 1-2 years of coming out and it would have been a good book to read ! However, if you have been out for a few years already it is not a ""manual"" for advice and new ideas with gay sex, but just an explanation of it all more or less."
3,Darwins blade,"This was my first Dan Simmons book, I'll probably get another one when I finish my new Jeffery Deaver books. I thought it was OK, but lacked the suspense I had anticipated."
1,Possible joke?,"As good a writer as Dan Simmons is, it's impossible for me to believe that this book is simply what it appears to be: really poorly written crap cribbed from the ""Darwin Awards"" chain email/website.It's so very bad that I think it's actually some kind of parody of the whole mystery/political suspense genre with a bit of sniper trivia and zen trivia thrown in for fun.Even as a parody it's a failure: not funny enough. As a ""serious novel"" it's utter garbage. Fans of Simmons other works and of literacy are warned to stay far away from this horrible misstep by an otherwise talented writer."
2,Good for Borrowing. . . Maybe,"I'm not sure I would like the other kinds of books Dan Simmons writes. I like thrillers and was drawn to this but read it with an ever-growing sense of dismay. Let's see--the book is about an insurance fraud investigator, like Kinsey Milhone, Sue Grafton's heroine, and the chapter headings are like the titles of Grafton's books, only bitchy--""A is for Hole."" Is this sniping at Sue Grafton? Or a strange kind of homage? I don't know and frankly don't care, but it was off-putting. Even more off-putting, as others have noted, was the recycling of urban legends, written about as if none of us have ever heard of them before. Seems somewhat contemptuous of us readers. After I read a courtroom anecdote that I saw re-enacted on a very old Saturday Night Live rerun, decades before this book was written, I stopped reading for pleasure and just started reading to see what else looked familiar. If you don't get out much you may like this book."
4,Are we all reading the same book?,"I too am stunned by the negative reviews of this extremely entertaining and thoughtful book. I wonder if a lot of it went over some people's heads or something. I don't say that to be mean, but there is a lot in this book to think about in addition to the terrific page turner action. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I reserve those for wildly exceptional books. This one was wildly entertaining."
1,Worst book I've read in my life,"This was so boring, I cannot begin to separate all the most boring parts. All the stuff about guns, fighting and airplane flying was over my pitiful female head. I rarely knew what was happening so why did I finish it??? Because I thought Dan S. was a good author and I kepy waiting for something to happen. Most of this was unbelievable."
5,Romance and danger in an action-packed adventure,"Darwin is a specialist in accident reconstruction, but despite the emotional nature of his job his life runs smoothly until his involvement with one accident - an attempt on his life. His probe into a possible conspiracy brings him both romance and danger in this action-packed adventure."
2,"Lots of borrowed material, too little character and style","I admire Dan Simmons's books. But I know from reading many of them that he's an uneven writer. This isn't one of his better books. He has recycled lots of Internet stupid-bizarre-accident mythology as investigative material to show off his protagonist's brilliance, and I got tired of seeing endlessly repeated urban legends trotted out as elements of his book. Though the plot is fairly interesting, Simmons diverts into these urban legends far too often. Like several other reviewers I also found it difficult to empathize with the charcters, though they are better drawn than many writers today seem capable of doing. If you read for plot, you may enjoy this book a lot. But it's definitely not up to the author's best."
2,"Ok boys and girls, can you say, ""Contractual obligation?""","This book is very disappointing, especially considering Mr. Simmons' talent. The main character is unbelievable: rich, intelligent, expert with a gun, mysterious background, etc.. As I was reading this, I felt like the author was showing off his talent in a book that he was probably obligated to write.With the inclusion of a lot of ""urban legends"" Mr. Simmons comes across as smug, as if he's somehow laughing at his audience, not with them. If you find yourself forced to read a book by this author, make this one your last choice."
2,Simmons first failure,"Before Darwin's Blade I thought Dan Simmons could do no wrong regardless of the genre that he chose to write in. This one is a big disappointment. It never takes off, the story never gells. But what turned me off the most is Simmons' contempt for the reader, for anyone less of a genius than himself. His constant referring to his specific preferences of weapons, food, furnishings, anything wears thin quickly. The hero (presumably Simmons image of himself) is so much smarter than the rest of the mere mortals in this book. But instead of this working in a fun way like a James Bond type character I found myself wishing he would just be humbled, but knew there was no chance of this happening. Simmons needs to take a step backward."
2,Simmons at his worst.,"I can't believe this is the same person who wrote Carrion Comfort and Hyperion. It's simplistic, full of cliches. It is like reading a rejected script for a Julia Roberts/William Hurt movie. It's clear Dan Simmons did his research -- too clear, in fact, because I couldn't help but feel that he laid in a lot of technical tidbits about accident reconstruction clumsily amongst a poorly executed action novel. The only reason I didn't give it one star is that it did make me laugh at a few points. Very disappointing, considering that (excluding Fires of Eden) I have loved everything else he has written."
3,Worst Dan Simmons book so far.,"There are a few good things to say about this book. I liked the stuff about the Spartan way of life, and I liked the military details, but there were a lot of bad things as well.1. It's just a run-of-the-mill suspense book. No real suprises, plot is dull.2. So much ""borrowing"" from the Darwin Awards. If you've ever read the Darwin Awards, about 30% of this book is filler.3. Weird hypocricy at the end. Simmons invites you to laugh at the dead throughout the book, then at the end he berates you for it. It's as if he suddenly realized he had been being a jerk for 400 pages.Try some of his other books instead."
2,Mildly entertaining,"As a ""novel of suspense"" it probably works. I find the whole genre boring, including this book. If you liked ""Hard as Nails"" you'll probably like this one. Don't expect anything like ""Hyperion"", ""Olympos"", ""Song of Cali"" or ""Drood""."
4,Lighten Up!,"O.k., so this isn't a Carrion Comfort or Song of Kali. It isn't suppose to be!!! With Darwin's Blade, Dan Simmons introduces us to his lighter side and creates a fast, fun, scarcastic thriller. Perfect for a day at the Beach or that long plane ride. This book is incredibly entertaining. I enjoyed it as much as any of Mr. Simmons' previous works."
2,Buy the other Darwin Book,"I don't think that I've ever been this disappointed with a book before. Dan Simmons is a huge, enormous talent, and this book is simply below him. Another reviewer asked if it was a parody, but I think it is a flat-out joke. I think Mr. Simmons went to the Darwin Awards web-site, cribbed all of the content and strung it together with a barely cohesive narrative.It is an even greater shame that a book this mediocre would come from the same man who wrote the wonderful (and terrifying) Hyperion."
3,"Not Great, But Still Fun","The last book I read from Dan Simmons was horror novel ""Children of the Night."" This is completely different. Darwin Minor is an accident investigator for insurance companies. One of the best in the business actually. But as he begins to uncover what may be massive insurance fraud,it seems someone definitely wants him dead.At times the book almost feels like something John Grisham would've penned. And the accidents are all based on real incidents, which unfortuantely are very funny at the expense of some very stupid people. There are points the book could use an editor,especially in regards to the meticulous detailing of firearms, but overall it's a mindless page turner for people with a penchant for Grisham or Patterson."
2,Writer's Market 2006,"Not as good as previous issues. I think they rushed to get this one out. A lot of current listings that are good are not included. I know they are good because I have sold features to them recently. Either the publisher of the Digest couldn't wait to get their input for the volume or sources did not want to offer the information for some reason.I also submitted several queries to editors/magazines listed in the volume only to be told that they do not accept freelance queries. When I asked one editor why her publication, with specific guidelines for queries was in the volume when she said she did not use any contributed material or freelance writers, she said she did not know where the digest got their information, but she certainly did not provide it and was not happy that it was there.This has happened 4 times. I have gone back to using the 2005 volume which seems to be much more up to date. I am very disappointed."
5,You Need This Book!,"If you want to break into writing, you need this book. I would even argue that buying the more updated ones would be a good investment, but I think this one is a great start."
5,I was a teenager again!,"I didn't know how much I missed his voice until I heard it again. Great album with all the best on it. Get It, you will not regret it."
4,Marvin Gaye,I like this CD. It's all of Marvin's great songs. It's nice to pop in when you in the mood for his music.
3,Still a good record ...,... opened for these guys in South Beach at the long-defunct Washington Square forever ago when they were UROK and bought this CD in mid-to-late 90s. Enjoyed it then and still dig it now. Some great songs on here.
4,A good one for Nancy fans,"Some of the highlights of this album (some recorded recently some vintage), are the adorable San Francisco, which sounds like the sugar album, the modern rock 99 miles from LA, the 70s pop/rock Hello La, good be Birhimgham, the rock and roll ""California Man"", and the lovely first ever Nancy song, ""Cuando Caliento el Sol."" The very pretty ""Theres no place like home"" closes the album. The one bad choice is covering HOtel Calif. a song I am sure most Nancy fans (and most anyone in general) isnt fund of."
2,Makes Her Sound Bad,"I'm sorry, but the arrangements/production of these songs just don't cut it. Nancy does not sound her best to me here. I barely like one song on the whole album. Nice try with a concept album about California but it sounds bland. Missed the mark for me on this one."
4,A pleasant day trip to Nancyville,"This is a pleasant, unassuming compilation of some songs Nancy did that have some theme relating to the State of California. Nancy Sinatra, of course, is not the singer her father was, nor even her brother, nor even as good as most of the many female singers she directly or indirectly inspired: you had to wait for Britney Spears to find a more limited vocalist of any major notoriety in Nancy's line of sponsorship.Nevertheless, she uses what she has as well as she can, and having the name and resources she does, she's got some good musicians and studio people here, including the magnificent Clem Burke and several of the oldtimers. If you want to hear some nice songs done pleasantly you won't be too disappointed, but if you are not already a hardcore fan, this won't convert you."
5,A winner,"Nancy Sinatra certainly hits the bullseye with ""California Girl,"" a totally enjoyable album start to finish. ""Ninety-nine Miles from L.A."" is the stunner but there's lots else here, from beautiful ballads, to uptempo swingers, from jazz standards to rockers, to keep the interest level sky high. Most notably, Miss Nancy reinvents virtually every one of the familiar songs intriguingly and convincingly. The arrangements are terrific and this is as fresh an album as you'll hear this year. If you're wondering how the voice has held up, well, on record and in person she sounds exactly the same but better. There's a wisdom and depth that only comes from experience. Do get this wonderful album--you will love it."
4,Great fun!,"This disc is a blast! ""99 Miles"" is to die for! Not only does Nancy rock, but she takes on some of the tunes with a hint of Miss Peggy Lee in her delivery. It's great to hear her branch out & do some bossa & jazz-flavored things, but this girl can still do the Pony when she needs to!"
2,"Lee Hazlewood, where are you?",Nancy seems like she certainly could use a little magic desert cowboy rapscallion in chaps twiddling her knobs...
5,The Grooviest California Girl out there!!!,"I can't tell you how happy I am that this album is finally out! There's no one more fabulous than Nancy! She was rocking the world before Debbie Harry and before Madonna, and she continues to entertain us! She's touring in support of this new album, so, if you get a chance, you must see her live! I highly recommend this c.d. and all of her great music."
3,A little disappointed,"I was not expecting perfection, but I am unable to get a clear sound in many areas of my apartment. I am usually forced to keep moving around to avoid interference. (my friend has the exact same problem with the same model phone)Also, the connection with the charger is a bit spotty and that also needs to be jiggled around to avoid having the battery die out on me.I would not buy the phone again. I am surprised that it was rated a best buy from Consumer Reports."
3,it's ok,"Bought two of these a few months ago ... For the money, they're fine. I have problems with mine echoing when I talk, but I can go everywhere--upstairs, downstairs, the porch--with them and have no problems. I also have problems with my speed dials not connecting (skipping a number, maybe?) but that might just be the phone service. Not great for holding between shoulder and chin, but that's not healthy for you anyhow."
2,Couple months later it died,"Just after a couple a months my phone has started to die, I have replace the battery and still it does not work like it should. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.Update: After having this phone for over a year and spending more money on it to fix it than what we bought it for, and time to mail it in to fix it, it is now to a point of not operating anymore. I have had better phones than this that have worked a lot longer. This is by far the worst phone out their."
4,low cost and clear,This phone is a great performing bargain.Good and clear inside house.Outside house reception good.Feels good in hand to ear and mouth.Would buy again.
1,DON'T BUY THIS,I have had my phone for just over a month and it is already falling apart. I wish I had not purchased it.
4,nice for the price,"This is a good phone for the money spent.Sound quality is great with no static, even when walking through the house.Sounds good outside as well.I am about to purchase a second phone for my office."
5,I am so glad I read and believed the other reviews here!,"This replaced three successive tries with an inherited Bell South cordless that malfunctioned in several ways. We only needed a simple model for the kitchen. The buttons are on the handset,which is curved and balanced to fit the hand and face. The Caller ID screen also shows the numbers you dialed; if you reach a wrong number, you can see right away if you misdialed. This saves both parties a lot of aggravation. There is a slim belt clip and a headset jack that make it possible to talk while cooking or doing laundry, multi-tasking like most people today. The jack is covered by a small,gray rubber trapdoor that keeps kitchen goo out of the outlet. Low cost + high Consumer Rating!"
1,died too soon,"I bought this phone in the fall and by the summer it had died. Until then it was a good phone, very good range. Great for people who buy phones like calenders. (One every year)"
1,Junk,"Junk, junk, junk. What else can I say. Good phone if you never make or receive calls. It is Ivory, though. The phone starts to have feedback...you know, it SCREAMS in your ear when you are using it.My cellular is better by far. I have a sony and it is good."
2,Why can't anyone make a phone that doesn't break?,"Phone was fine while it worked. Liked the caller ID and name / number storage, though it was a bit cumbersome. But after 9 months it started with a loud buzzing. Getting it replaced under warranty - though that one will probably die also"
1,HORRIBLE PHONE!!,"This Phone is very deceiving!It looks nice has a lighted display very well put together!Well all would be great if the caller ID would work!all that comes up is ""incomplete data"" everytime I get a phone call, when I hang up the phone it sometimes then decides to tell me who called!This phone is worthless!!!Dont be fooled!!!"
4,"A decent device, especially for the price.","Fairly clear sound, both incoming and outgoing.Battery life seems OK.Simple operation.Good ergonomics, comfortable handset.Strange wall mounting, juts into the room.Caller ID faces out for easy reading.This is a good value. In my experience, no wireless phone has ""corded phone quality"", and the EXI376 is no exception. But, as cordless phones go, it has very good reception and transmission, all for a very reasonable price. What more do you need?"
3,decent phone for the given price,"Pro:Light, compact, backlighted LCD (auto shut off after a few seconds), ringer off option (even though the manual doesn't say so), good ergonomic (ear piece area slightly contours out to fit ear/face), callerID+callWaitingID, volume+ringer control, memory store with name, cheapCon:sound quality is OK (not as good as my old Panasonic900mhz), no lighted keypad (Amazon description is wrong), buttons are hard plastic (I like them w/rubber), any button pressed will turn on phone (could be a plus for Rocket Dial). only 10 memory dials, annoying ring tone(s), short batterylife.Well, all in all, an OK phone for the price. I don't havethe problem with poor contact with the base while charging.I only had it for a few weeks. Reception is OK, even when the base is at 2nd floor, and I amtrying it down in the basement, the sound quality is the same."
5,Wide Variety,"While I was not the biggest fan of this movie (although now that I've been to Italy, I might like it better), I remember hearing the music and thinking ""I bet this has a great soundtrack."" Not only is the soundtrack great, it offers an amazingly diverse group of singers. From Nina Simone (jazz) to Portishead (trip hop) this CD masterfully combines different tastes of music to create a CD that really works well together. Some of the gems of this cd are Liz Phair's ""Rocketboy,"" Stevie Wonder's hit ""Superstition,"" Billie Holiday's ""I'll Be Seeing You,"" and Lori Carson's ""You Won't Fall."""
5,"A cool, sultry, eclectic mix","OK, here's the deal: I have fairly eclectic tastes in music. Not as eclectic as some, but Bach rests near the Black Crowes on my CD shelf, and I love all good music, whatever the genre.But NEVER did I expect to be able to buy a disc that included John Lee Hooker, Portishead and Cocteau Twins on the same recording, and have it make sense! What a collection. There's the proverbial ""something for everyone"" here, from Trip Hop to Blues...and it all works together somehow. My advise: Get it, play it, love it. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Ozzie & Harriet 3 Half Hour Television Episodes, Volume 2",It's too bad this dvd is flawed because it has 3 of the best episodes of Ozzie and Harriet....with good digital video quality....the problem is there is NO SOUND on the dvd. it is obviously a mistake by the company.....I have talked with many other people who also have NO SOUND on this dvd. If anyone has a copy that works....please let me know...it would be 5 STARS if it worked
1,GET IT TOGETHER { MAGELLAN },"I have been a fan of magellan for year's, but it look's like you CAN'T GET T TOGETHER on this streets & topo . I have tryed my friends Meridian my OLD gps 2000 work's better than that, was going to but one but I'll wait till you guys GET IT TOGETHER { I hope }before i buy one . Hope to see you back on top soon PS Hope your CEO gets wind of this"
3,Nice to have roads on your GPS,This program is easy and works pretty good. Could be better with some better waypoint features.
1,Bad buy - too inaccurate to be useful,"If you're looking for street level point-to-point navigation, look elsewhere. Not quite useless, but nearly so. Locations on uploaded regions are up to two-tenths of a mile off kilter. The best it will do is get you to the general area so you can then use the map image like a paper road map. It will not get you door-to-door. If you're in moutain back country, could be life-and-death serious!The folks at Thales (pronounced ""tallus"")/Magellan say they are well aware of the inaccuracy and are trying to find a more reliable data supplier. I'd wait!"
2,Disappointed in Magellan Mapsend St. Gold CD ROM US & Europe,"I bought the Mapsend Streets Gold CD ROM and Mapsend Street (Europe) for my new SporTrack Pro GPS. Loading the software to my PC was flawless. Loading the data from my PC to the GPS unit was also flawless. The disappointing part was the outdated maps. What's the use of having state of the art hardware (SporTrack Pro) if the software if obsolete (Magellan Mapsend). I find myself driving off the road and on nonexistent roads when I look at my GPS and most of these streets are at least 4 years old. I downloaded the map for Venice and guess what, only one canal is on the map and not all street are shown. When I emailed Magellan for assistance I received their email thanking me for contacting them but that was it. I never heard anything else out of Magellan. If you're in the market for an excellent GPS unit with obsolete software, buy Magellan."
1,Mapsend Software not worth the $$$$,I recently purchased a Sport Trak Pro and thought that I would use it to plan camping and hunting trips around the country. I found right away that the maps included were seriously lacking in detail so purchased the mapsend software. What a waste of money. I found that the data is outdated and in some cases just wrong. I was driving down a street that I use often and found that I was 500 feet to the side. In some cases that streets are not even listed even though they have been in place for years. I hope that Magellan is expecting to update the software to be more accurate and complete very soon or this device is less than useful.
1,"book - ""The Bushido Code""","I'm afraid that I can't give this much of a review. This book was ordered by mistake. I thought that I was ordering a book that I once had by the same name, but when it arrived I found that it was a novel and not the book that I had so many years ago. I have not read this book nor do I have intentions of reading it."
3,Samurai vs FBI,"This starts out as a very tightly woven narration and characterization of a number of players, and goes on well into the end game very well, but then essentially kinda wanders out the door with a less than satisfying conclusion... which i won't reveal...For the Japonophile there is little new except perhaps some added nuance as to the way of the Samurai...and there is a poignance to the interjections from the antagonists childhold memories of Hiroshima... which is the fuse which lights the flame in this story."
2,Disjointed and Weird,"Nothing ever really seemed to happen. The chapters are very short, snippets of info about the characters, each with their own problems and hang ups. I was halfway through the book and still wondering if something was going to happen. It never really seemed to, until, perhaps the last 20 pages, and even then it was anticlimactic.I continued to read it out of curiousity I suppose, and because it was an easy, quick read. I can certainly see why some might love this book. It's got a mystical sort of cryptic flow to it, and the intertwined lives of the characters some might find intricate and compelling. But I didn't. Not really."
3,it's okey,it's enough for a academic person :) i think posibility -a little- bigger than this size. but this is okey
2,Unnecessarily complex deconsruction of basic concepts,"After using this book for a history of revolutions course, it is clear that the concepts Brinton describes become quickly lost in extensive rhetoric. While the arguments may be clear for the sole fact that they are relatively simplistic in light of revolutionary thought, Brinton's arguments, if taken alone, are loose and incomplete. He speaks of concepts, defines them four or five times, yet somehow avoids providing a clear definition of those same concepts. If you want to read this book, read a summary instead. You'll get just as much out of it and perhaps gain a clearer understanding."
2,Highly overrated. It's like listening to a crazed profesor.,"This is a tricky book that will take you on a roller-coaster ride to get to the simplest of points. Brinton seems like he may finally make a point but will then turn around and ramble on for five pages on something completely irrelevant. Many sentances are as long and complicated as Henry David Thoreau's, but nowhere near as beautiful. Be prepared to reread entire pages. And I hope you have a dictionary handy...This book is not worth the effort if you're anything less than a professional historian."
1,ATTN: ENVIRONMENTALISTS--DO NOT KILL ANOTHER TREE!,"If you are looking for a good book in explaining a series of revolutions this is not what you want. Although it had many good factual references, he made you read 300 pages to extract about 3 pages of useful information. Not only did he ramble on incessantly, he also would jump from one revolution to another with no distinct change in thought. You may read 5 pages thinking it was one revolution and then he finally tells you, and probably accidentally, which he is speaking of. The opinions and knowledge he presents in the book are those than anyone can access through a good teacher, or even a mediocre book!! Save your $!"
1,Not my cup of tea,"I don't honestly know what I expected when I decided to rent this movie - I should have researched it a little better. I found the story and the characters completely unsavory and, while the irony did not at all escape me, I felt almost sickened seeing the way some humans treat one another. Don't get me wrong, I like historical movies and (especially) British mysteries, but most of them have some redeeming values; however, I could not find any in this film. I thought Glen Close's character was snakelike and repellent and can't imagine why any man with half a brain would want to sleep with her, much less go to a lot of trouble to do it. I did try to watch ""Valmont"" because I like Colin Firth, but this whole story is just too offensive to me to enjoy."
5,An exceptional 18th century aristocract film,John Malkovich and Glenn Close are awesome.The plot focuses on the interaction of the characters and their desire to show personal control and power over themselves and others. The 18th century aristocrat setting supplements the inter-personal relationships.The movie was redone with a modern day scenario in the film 'Cruel Intentions'. I enjoyed the comparison although 'Dangerous Liaisons' is definitely tops.
5,A truly amazing film.,"The leading actors are all magnificent in this diabolic plot that is created for the pleasures given by revenge and to obtain redress, and most of all is the result of vanity and a desperate longing for absolute power. The drama that is produced in front of us with such beauty and ease shows of an amount of cruelty that is matchless. The two main characters of Glenn Close and John Malkovich sets of a series of events that is not only to devastate the lifes of others, but ultimately to destroy their own. All because of their refusal to see clearly what emotions they are driven by and the nature of their desires. Finally, Michelle Pfeiffer has never been more radiant. With her fragile and restrained appearance that hides remarkable strength and courage to overcome that fragility she was born to play the part of Mme de Tourvel whose passionate heart becomes her ruin."
5,Love for Malkovich,"I won't rehash the whole plot, we all know the story. I'd give this version of Dangerous Liaisons more stars if could. I only have one thing to say. I'm tired of all those people who say that John Malkovich wasn't handsome enough to play Valmont. Justin Chang from California wrote that he ""didn't completely buy Malkovich as the charming lady-killer"" and that casting him in the role was a ""a small but serious flaw that undermines the whole film"". Bulls**t!How could anyone watch Malkovich's stellar performance and think of nothing except looks. Hollywood is so full of ""good-looking"" actors and actresses who can't act their way out of a paper bag. In modern times we often value conventional beauty over all other aspects of a person's character. A lot of these Hollywood hunks wish they could act as well as Mr. Malkovich. Get over it, people, no one will ever play Valmont better!"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Far better than Cruel Intentions, the recent remake, Dangerous Liaisons is a biting costume drama that portrays pre-revolutionary France as just about the most decadent place on earth; with good performances by the always-reliable Malkovich and a suprisingly villainous Glenn Close, it's an effective film."
2,Disappointed,"I've purchased several DVD's from Amazon and I've always been very satisfied...until now.This particular DVD was of very poor quality, dark and grainy. I would have sent it back, but it's not worth the postage."
2,Didn't enjoy the film,"The acting was good and believable, Glenn Close, John Malkovich, Michelle Pfeiffer, Uma Thurman, all played their parts well. But I simply didn't enjoy seeing the depraved natures of the characters Close and Malkovich played - it was quite awful, even in a movie."
3,Great Film. Great Cast. No Extras.,"Superb film--Excellent cast. Probably Malkivich's best film. No DVD Extras, too bad."
5,Classic must have movie,"Loved it at the cinema, still loving it more than a decade later. Wonderful actors in a well written play. It's a must have in anyone's DVD collection."
4,A successful remake,"Having read the original novel, I can really admire the director's execution of the plot, considering that the novel consists entirely of letters. It must be really challenging for the screenplay writer to work off the original text that consists of multiple first person narratives. The screenplay writer and the director did a fine job of covering all the major points in the plot. All the dialogues were recreated seamlessly. The costumes were impeccable. I didn't even mind the actors being American, because they left their American personas behind and entered a world completely unfamiliar to them."
4,A MUST-SEE!,"'Dangerous Liaisons' is an adaptation of a scandolous 18th century French book. Glenn Close is the scheming, vicious Marquise De Merteuil, who would like nothing more than to see the man that left her punished. What better way to do this than to have her friend (and ex-lover) the Vicomte De Valmont (John Malkovich) seduce her ex-husband's soon-to-be wife Cecile De Volanges (Uma Thurman).Whilst we're at it, throw in the virginal Madame De Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer) whom the Vicomte is extremely desirous of seducing, Keanu Reeves as a musician who lusts after Cecile and the Marquise, and the fact that the Vicomte lusts after the Marquise but she will not allow him to have her. All in all, somewhat confusing and dense as regards to whom is sleeping with whom and why, but still nasty vicious fun.Glenn Close and John Malkovich are excellent in their respective roles, and the supporting cast help them along nicely, but you will need to concentrate to understand this period piece."
3,Great Movie Horrible Transfer,"This is one of the best movies of all time. However, the video transfer to DVD is one of the worst I have ever seen. There are numerous video artifacts that pop up throughout the film. I find them very distracting and it makes the movie difficult for me to watch. If you choose to buy this movie as I did, beware. If you are irritated by video blemishes steer clear of this title."
3,Stiff Competition,"I first saw this on VHS a few years ago, and remember being stunned by the great acting, the rich costumes, fine settings, not to mention the sheer depravity of the tale; easily 4-5 stars. Then, purely by chance this year, I bought a copy of Untold Scandal, not realising it was a Korean version of the same story. Wow! Folks, this is how it should be done.Intrigued, I dug out my old tape and watched it again. The performances still stand up, but the film-making looks jerky, crude, graceless. Still worth watching? Yes; but get hold of Untold Scandal too. You won't be sorry."
3,Disappointing transfer,This movie looks the same on Blu-ray as it does on DVD. No improvement at all in picture quality.No reason to upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray in this case. Save your money.
3,"Great movie, horrible DVD","I can't get past fifteen minutes watching this DVD. It is a botched job, with dirt, soft focus ... Give me my old widescreen VHS anyday."
5,A Movie Masterpiece,"This is without a doubt, one, if not the most memorable films of all time. You can watch it a dozen times, and still be able to discover anew an incredible amount of stunning, yet simple, pronouncements on some of life's most profound conditions. I enjoy the tight, and sophisticated word play. The musical score is perfectly balanced. A sumptiously displayed and highly thought-provoking film, laying bare the very essence of the morals and values of Western Civilization."
5,An Unexpected Treat,"I picked this up with no great expectations but was wonderfully surprised by the author's witty writing and her ability to capture the 70s. It's also nice to see a mystery heroine who enjoys sex and actually gets it! Brava, Ms. Moore!"
4,Entertaining,"I met the author at a book reading and found her to be a very interesting person. She read the first chapter (it's short) and I was hooked! The story flows nicely. It's not a particularly deep or sophisticated book. It is entertaining in that I was always drawn to read further to see where the character was going.I realate this type of book to easy, relaxing reading for those times when you want to escape reality and enjoy the world of images and imagination."
2,I'm not happy!,"I would have given this product a 5 star review, but it only gets a 2.the reason ... it was advertised as a package deal, including a 17"" monitor. Unfortunately for me, there was no monitor and the seller hasnot answered the phone or my emails and other inquiries. I had to buy a monitor, which cost me even more than I would have spent had I dealt withanother more honest supplier. So Electronica Direct gets a low 2 starrating."
2,Not very enlightening,Not useful for the egyptophile in my view. On the other hand - if you buy the Black Ancient Egyptian trip - you might find this work of interest.
5,great book!,"I laughed, I cried, and realized things I had not thought of. As with any REAL story it is great. I did not find it scattered. The story is told formatted in ""days in the life"" of several military spouses and the situations that they each face. Once you grasp who each character is, you won't be able to put it down. I didn't once think it was fake or written with fluff. I was so impressed with this book, I lent it to my friends."
5,Every American should read this book,"A common comment these days amongst military families is ""our country isn't at war...our military is...the country is at the mall."" Although our country is still at war, the only ones truly sacrificing are the military and their families. (and for many those sacrfices will continue for a lifetime, no matter when this war ends.) I nodded and sobbed and laughed throughout this book. Kristin is an amazing writer and managed to do incredibly thorough research to follow these families through their experiences. A military spouse herself who has dealt with multiple deployments, she captures the challenges. We wish every person in Congress would study books like this so they have a full view of the impact of their decisions.Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help! I'm a Military Spouse...I Get a Life Too!"
5,An Awesome Read!,"I haven't even received my copy yet, but I've already read this book several times (borrowed from a friend) and wanted a copy of my own. From the moment I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster that you'll appreciate whether you're a military spouse or not. I cried along with the women during their trying times and rejoiced with them at their husband's homecomings. The author captures the essence of the moments exactly. I would reccomend this book to anyone looking for a good read, just remember to bring the tissues!"
5,The best book I've ever read and a must read for any American,"I have been looking for a good book to read about military life as I will be a military spouse in a year. I was completely blown away by this book! Sometimes you laughed, sometimes you cried, and sometimes your heart just stopped. This is a MUST read for anyone who calls themselves an American, whether they have connections to the military or not. Until you have lived this life, you have no idea how hard it is, but this book will give you the best perspective possible from someone who has been there and done that."
5,army wife in the house!!!!,"This book contains the true emotions and behind the scenes that the spouses go through. Everyone faces it differently but reading this book comfirmed that I am not alone in my feelings. I found strength and courage through the stories of my fellow wives. Being a military spouse gets very hard each day for me since my husband is deployed, but i love that man and i would never trade marrying someone else. ~Proud Army Wife"
5,A Moving Account of Deployment Issues for Those Left Behind,"I was looking for information on deployment and got so much more from Kristin Henderson's book! Moving, emotional, real-life accounts that touch the heart and help us civilians better comprehend the challenges of wartime delpoyment. Kristin interviews a variety of spouses and 'significant others' recounting their respective experiences, all with very different perspectives.It's definitely a book that you won't put down until the last chapter is read!"
2,13 year old Zeon,"(This game) consists of horrible repetetive tasks such as hitting switches, retrieving items, bad-guy beat 'em up, and dee-dee catching. Again and again and again. Does it sound boring enough? No you say? Well how about the fact that when you finally complete a puzzle, minutes after dinner you boot it up, only to find that you must do it again!?! Oh yeah, fighting robots like this is lame. Or how about catching D-D one-by-one and returning her to the molecular bla-bla tube five times in a row? That is not my idea of a good game. Also the graphics could have been better. Bam(company that made this game), you have once again failed, I think your game is boring. Only good in long, lame car trip sessions. Do not tell your friends you have this game, it's embarassing. Not for teens, only fans 7-11 yrs. old."
2,what is this i don't even,"In spite of what some reviews claim, the graphics are not bad. While it isn't breaking any grounds, it isn't so poor as to be unplayable. There are, however, problems regarding collision, and a slew of bugs that frankly should have been caught long before release.The game is playable, though the music is repetitive, Deedee's soundbytes are ghastly, any and all moving platform puzzles are more frustrating than need be (see: collision issues), and there are too many aspects that could permanently prevent you from completing the title.If you're going to get it, I recommend doing so at the lowest price, it really isn't worth more. When your biggest challenge in the game is navigating the level design you know you could have done better."
2,"Bad Graphics, Bad Play","Not only are the graphics in this game terrible compared to games like Mario Kart and Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 for Game Boy Advance, but the stroyline is pretty dull as well.I guess I just expected more from my favorite cartoon show since the days of He-Man and the original Voltron."
2,Jimmy Neutron Rip Off,"Okay,i like the show dexters lab but this game?Bad graphics and you see dee-dee like 2 million times!Also,what about our genius 10 year old,jimmy neutron who saved the world?Well,they made a game for that too!But then,did dexter make a robopuppy?And in the jimmy neutron game,you can pick from jimmy,goddard,carl,cindy or ultralord while in dexter you be one charecter fighting robots!Dumb,huh?"
4,Short and useful,"i would like to confirm that im so not one of those self help weirdos who must have a book for every decision they make in life however.............the book is really good when youve a lot goin on in your life and helps you put things into perspective,it can be a bit dr phill at times but its really nice and realxing and you dont have to read it in one go,just whenever you need it pick a chapter. it flushes out all the negativity and brings you back to basics. perfect for stressful situations!!"
5,This author has it figured out,"I feel better, clearer and more thoughtful after reading this book. No matter how many of his books I read I learn more from each and new things about each topic."
1,Continuous Babblings,"As usual Mr. Dyer takes something simple and makes it complex. He has a right to his viewpoint for sure, but let's base it on something substantial. Waynes problem is that he is unable to distinguish the difference between truth and his prolific imagination. His next book will be called ""Lost in Translation"""
5,A beautiful book,"This is the second time I have purchased this book, I gave away the first copy. It is so beautiful and sweet. It is packed with wonderful inspirational info. I use it for a little 'pick me up' whenever I need it. I would recommend it as a thoughtful gift or something nice for yourself!"
5,Dyer: 10 Secrets,"This book is an easy read and full of 'ah-ha' moments; very enlightening.Dyer uses every day examples to bring his ideas to all. It helps to grasp the entirity of the concept.I had to adjust my thoughts to make sense of all the ""God"" talk - I'm not super religous. I did learn that Dyer's idea of God is not the traditonal man in the sky, but a force that is within us all. That made it easier for me to relate to."
5,"Brilliant! Dyer is a Rare, Powerful, Teacher & Storyteller.","All of his books are filled with the greatest lessons there are, woven within great and uplifting stories. Most of his books are bigger than this one, with a lot more elaboration. Yet, I love this little book and found it as powrful if not more powerful than many of his other bigger books. It really is a must read. I'd like to also say that, having had the opportunity to sit a few feet from Dr. Dyer at a seminar (actually about this title), he is an extremely humble, warm, funny, and generous person. There is a lot more to his teachings than a lot of people think. Whether you have read his other books or are thinking of this as an introduction to Dr. Dryer, this is a great choice. Makes a fantastic gift. I also highly recommend a book called 'Effortless Wellbeing' by Evan Finer. It has great ideas like Dr. Dyer's books, and also includes mental and physical exercises and how-to stuff."
5,10 Commandments for Peace Today,"Dr. Dyers has taken 10 simple secrets and turned them into commandments if you want succes & true peace today.Moses's 10 commandments are great, but I haven't wanted to kill anyone lately. I needed 10 FRESH ideas that are appropriate for today's living. Wayne brings common sence together in a way that is uncommonly found. I buy this book and share it with anyone that I think will read it...We all can benefit from 10 SIMPLE secrets of Success and Inner Peace!"
5,this has the answers to who we are,"i have read this book three times the more you read it, the more it makes sense, this man has great knowlege of the universe, i have great belief in what he teaches in this book and it works, its a must to buy along with [the calling of your true self] i have read both it will help you understand we are the secret both these authors are in touch with spirit and learn you [you too can feel inner peace with the help in both of these books,"
4,Awesome!,"Verification of ""right thinking"" ! You are (become) what you think , the universal law of ""what you focus on increases"" will guide to what you will become."
5,10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace,This is such a Great book I have boughten copeys for all my childern.
2,"A plush book, in every sense of the word","What you get for your money: a pastel-colored book with a soft plush cover, some watercolor sketches with text on top of them, and a photo of Mr. Dyer's smiling face on the back.It makes for nice decoration, but it doesn't make for serious reading. The 10 secrets are little poetic statements that you've heard before in ""Life's Little Instruction Book"", among other places.From Mr. Dyer's talks, its clear he knows a lot about inner peace. Too bad he's more interested in packaging it and selling it for profit than teaching it. (There's also a bit of a feeling like he's trying to indoctrinate you into something...)"
5,I love it,"This sock is really comfortable to wear, I bought a 3 pack, and allways wear them when they're out of the washing machine. I'm going to buy more of these, no doubt. The sock is pretty thin for a normal sock, wich makes it breathe, yet a little thicker at the top wich is also good, since it works as a cushion against some uncomfortable shoes."
2,Weak!,"I loved the anime of Golgo 13, and I'm also kind of a fan of Sonny Chiba, but this movie wasn't too great. It had some cool 60s style cinematography and settings, but I think the film failed to have the same attitude and style that the original comics did. I recommend the anime version highly over this one, but its worth checking out if you're a Duke Togo fan like myself.If you're looking for some great 60s Japanese gangster flicks, check out Tokyo Drifter and Branded To Kill, both directed by Seijin Suzuki. They are really cool!"
2,Not what you may expect,"In a anime about a professional hitman, you expect blood and violence, not sexual content. In Golgo 13, you get all the above. In fact, this anime is more of a soft-core Hentai then a drama about a professional killer. This could of done with out the sexual content, and used that time to develop the plot more. The plot is good as long as you can get past the unnecessary Hentai scenes. But you have to watch thorough the entire move for the plot to come together. I gave this move only 2 stars, only because the animation is excellent. I would not recommend this."
2,Sloppy animation...,"""Golgo 13: The Professional"" is a movie I struggle with. It has strong characters, an interesting plot, but a very tired feel and poor animation. It's about an assassin named Golgo 13. The film mostly consists of small stories about our hero on assignments and missions while injecting large amounts of excessive sex and sick violence. This film is not a feel-good. As a matter of fact, none of this movie is ever any cheerful. I suppose hardcore fans of anime might like this, but everyone else will want to stay away."
5,"Little known, little appreciated.","Golgo 13's one of those movie's that goes around appreciated by only a few. Most of my friends who've seen it either loved it or hated it, depending. I think a lot of the sex scenes turn people off to the film, as well as it's noir setting and odd style of story progression. Perhaps the film's an acquired taste -- I loved it after having seen it once, and even after several years since seeing it for the first time I love it still. Many of the dark elements of the film -- exposing humanity's more negative aspects with no mercy -- I think leaves an unsettling mood in the audience. But, heh, that's why I love the film. In fact, I liked this one better than ""Queen Bee,"" Queenie being the one more people seem to like, I guess, because it has more of a ""linear"" feel to it than this one.Anyways, SEE THIS MOVIE. It's artsy, even in the scenes where a head's being blown off ... ."
4,One of the first anime films...,"This is an anime classic, with lots of action and an interesting storyline. It had some very good graphics for its time! The film focuses on a killer named Duke Togo, code named Golgo 13, who one of the trained proffesionals that works as a hitman. It has at least 10 F-bombs, and that's okay. The violence is brutal, and there is nudity. The animation was [bad], though... But it must have been amazing to see 20 years ago. Anyway, it was a great action/thriller."
4,"UNDENIABLE,UNSTOPPABLE,INVINCIBLE...","Straight from the very popular Japanese adult graphic novel series by Takao Saito,the ultimate assassin for hire,GOLGO 13.Golgo 13 has got to be one of the coldest,most methodical and enigmatic characters to have ever been put to print or film.Top notch animated action drama.The bodies begin to fall and the body count rises when Golgo 13 gets into action.Truly one of my all time favorite animes.I have been a huge fan of Golgo 13 for many years and hope to see more Golgo 13 anime in the future..."
2,Stinker Alert...,I bought this book in the hope of learning more about the English Revolution; it's gonna take a revolution to get me through the final pages.There is almost no mention of Cromwell's military exploits. In fact any military engagments are mentioned only in passing and in the past tense. Although the auther does mention that Cromwell's greatest fame among his contempories was due to his Army's victories. And that's it. Plus Cromwell's crushing of a Irish rebellion also gets barely a mention. I'd leave this one of the shelf and keeping looking.
1,never thought I'd find it again!!!!,Didn't know Mel had any other songs than this one! Hold me Kiss me Thrill me Long many years ago I fell in love with this song!!!!!!!!
5,A fitting tribute to a MASTER of romantic rock ballads.,"Mel Carter is the man whom everyone knows and no one has heard of. Ask anyone if they have heard of ""Hold Me, Kiss Me, Thrill Me"" and you will be met with a look of glassy disinterest. Yet, if you play the opening of that piece, no one can resist joining in on the musical celebration that is Mel Carter's legacy. This album contains his great works (including ""Be My Love"") and some lesser known ones. But they are all terrific."
5,A BIT OF NOSTALGIA,"JUST RECEIVED THIS ON FRIDAY AND HAVE LISTENED AT LEAST 5-6 TIMES ALREADY. AS A CHILD GROWING UP (AND I'LL BE 56 TOMORROW) MY PARENTS ALWAYS HAD MUSIC PLAYING. MY FATHER WAS IN THE SERVICE AND TO SUPPLIMENT HIS INCOME HE WOULD DJ FOR THE BASE RADIO STATION. THIS IN TURN ALLOWED US TO HAVE ALL TYPES OF MUSIC IN THE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY SINCE MY DAD ALSO PLAYED THE DRUMS. MY MOTHER HAD A BEAUTIFUL SINGING VOICE AND WON MANY COMPETITIONS AS A YOUNG GIRL. NEEDLESS TO SAY I HAVE HEARD EVERYTHING FROM THE 50'S AND 60'S, BIG BAND AND OUNTRY GROWING UP. BUT EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER I HAVE LOVED HOLD ME THRILL ME KISS ME AND EVERY TIME I HEAR IT, IT BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES. THE REST OF THE CD IS JUST AS FANTASTIC. I WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ONE WHO HAS WONDERFUL MEMORIES OF DAYS WHEN MUSIC WAS EASY TO LISTEN TO AND MADE YOU FEEL GOOD!!!"
5,Mel's the Most,This is one romantic CD...I would love to dance to everyone of these songs. It is absolutely great!
4,Hard to find - Easy to hold on to once found!,"Mel Carter is one great artist. What ever happened to him? (Just curious if anyone knows). Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me is my favorite - a true legend. Other titles on the album are great, too."
5,It's very pritty,It is high quality and ready to ware. No links were broken or discolored and the price was worth it. I would buy from this vender again whe i have need for silver or anyother product. And I got my proudct supper quick.
5,Very pleased,"I purchased this as a gift for a relative and was delighted with the quality, just lovely, and the price can't be beat!! Very well made with sturdy clasp."
4,saved time and money,I ordered this chain for my husband - it looks very nice and saved me from running to the malls. Price was good as well. Very satisfied.
5,Great Buy on a Sterling Chain,I ordered this figaro chain for a tiny charm I purchased at a jewelry show. This chain is much prettier and priced less than I could buy at the show. I love this link design - this is a fantastic buy! The chain arrived promptly as noted in the description. It is very nicely polished. It is also marked sterling which is what I wanted to purchase. I was surprised at how beautiful the chain is when it arrived! I will buy from this vendor again in the future.
4,A WW2 movie for the family,This movie shows what one man who fully trusts in God and His power can accomplish. Even under constant German oppression much was done to further God's plan for this world. It ends with a great demonstration of forgiveness.
4,Awesome except for one BIG inaccuracy,"This is an awesome and hugely entertaining movie, except for one MAJOR historical inaccuracy: the negative portrayal of the Pope, who is made to appear more concerned about art treasures in the Vatican than about human lives. The truth is that he secretly instructed Catholic clergy to save lives by any means, and asked churches and convents throughout Italy to shelter Jews. In Rome, 155 convents and monasteries sheltered some 5,000 Jews, 3,000 found refuge at one time at the Pope's summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, and hundreds lived within the walls of the Vatican. One Jewish woman even gave birth in the Vatican. If it weren't for that, I'd give the movie five stars - and I recommend it anyway. Just ignore the absolutely lame portrayal of the Pope. Everything else is great."
5,World War II film,"This is a remarkable movie about a holy priest who is bent on saving Jews. He is not a perfect person, which I like that they don't potray it that way. He is continually escaping from the Nazis. He even dressed up as a nun, a very tall one, which I thought was funny. Another time he walked around and tried to sell pictures of the Holy Father to the nazis acting as a person who sells things. If you like World War II films that will touch your heart. This is the one to watch."
5,Great Movie,Peck and Plummer shine in this WWII epic. I very good movie. I highly recommend watching this great movie classic.
4,"Overall, pretty good","But, there are some inaccuarcies. Such as where Pius XII's actions are minimized and where a concordat of Pius XI is treated as his own.Then there's the scene (I'll try not to give away the plot) where a priest about to be killed, have given Last Rites to himself."
4,"A tense, brilliantly acted story of redemption and courage","Peck shines as an Irish priest in the Vatican during the second world war. As a neutral, he's free to come and go throughout Rome. What the Nazis don't know, but are beginning to suspect, is that this courageous servant of God is also shielding downed Allied pilots and Jews. Based on a true story. Christopher Plummer is simply diabolical as the Nazi officer persecuting Peck. And Sir John Gielgud makes a convincing appearance as His Holiness. The ending is especially moving. Okay for all ages. This is one of the very few movies made for Television that I feel safe calling ""excellent""."
4,Worth it!,"Besides being a true story, a well made movie. Excellent performances by the two actors. The first time I saw this movie over ten years back, I will not forget the last scene where Kapler looks into the camera with eyes of wonder/tears...."
4,The Scarlet and the Black,This is a very well done movie. I enjoy watching movies with great ensembles of actors. The story was very compelling.
2,Not a keeper,"I love Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer, but they seemed to be sleep walking through their parts. Peck seemed to forget his Irish accent in some of the scenes. Also, if you are taking allied troops across Rome, wouldn't private transport be safer? Some of the scenes just didn't create the drama intended. I just can't recommend this movie."
5,Excellent!,"One of our favorite movies of the WWII era. Too many young people now seem to view that time period as ""the good old days"" when everything was easy. A great treatment of a sticky subject, showing just how difficult life could be and often was during war times. Hitchcock-type suspense throughout and excellent acting from both major characters!"
5,Scarlet and Black,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, filled with action, humor, and heartfeld emotion, not to mention great actors."
2,seen it all before,"Lets see what we have here. Inocent good people traveling through an isolated part of America run into back woods hillbillys or mutant canilbalistic killers . Saw it all before in Deliverance ,The Texas chainsaw masacre( original and the remake ), Wrong Turn, and not to mention the first Hills have Eyes. It`s been done to death ."
1,Horror Can Only Happen Around Stupidity?,"This is another of those horror movies that is predicated around the idea that people are just plain dumb. Have a wreck in the desert? Bicker for several hours, and then finally go off looking for help while resisting wearing a hat, and taking almost no water. Walk for 2 1/2 hours in 100+ degrees, just to find the road you were on appears to have vanished? Don't hurry back, hell, take a precarious trail down so you can explore a bunch of wrecks there and pick up a lice ridden teddy bear for your little girl. Your family pet runs off into the middle of nowhere? Insist on sitting back down for dinner while you let your young son go off after it. Sense danger? Let your young son grab a gun and go outside (duh, Mom?). And that's just in the first 40 minutes. By the time we get to the radioactive mutants, the story has lamed itself so much that it's hardly worth watching. And the mutant part is so cliched, it is barely worth watching either."
3,mixed emotions,"I at first thought this was just another lame modern horror flick made to be gratuitous but then I realized it was a remake of an old lame horror flick of the 70's. I normally only like a horror film if it has a strong driving premise and the violence is an afterthought used simply to enhance the plotline. I watched this one because I thought the premise was promising but somehow it just didn't come off well to me. I don't think horror film fans who enjoy gratuitous violence scenes will be particularly satisfied either. There just aren't any particularly original deaths, and in fact more of the ""mutants"" end up getting killed than the poor helpless family.? While this movie tries to play both sides it just didn't seem to follow through either way. Instead of feeling like I was watching a desparate family fighting for their lives against hopeless odds, I felt like I was watching some actors in makeup harrasing some other actors who were being over dramatic."
4,not too bad,"this is a good remake of the original but just does not have the ""shock"" effect of the original. the updated story is pretty much true to the first one and includes better dialogue and an enhanced story line. i would recommend purchasing this on DVD to add to your collection. especially if you are a horror buff like me."
4,scary as hell,"The makers of High Tension improved themselves a lot.If you liked ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" you should love this one.I hate movies where you can guess every step in advance...that's why I liked this movie...good story, good actors and the uncut version is tough as hell.Do not pass on the extras...especially the making of is worth it!I'm looking forward seeing more movies from those guys.Tom"
4,"Very nice. Blood, gore, killing, suspense, and horror. What a great combo...oh and did I mention those freaks in the hills?!","I know this is a remake, and I never have seen the original, but I would probably guess that this certainly has beaten it. Its hard for me to stop watching this movie. Its got all of the great horror elements to it. I really miss those now days...pathetic excuses for a horror movie like the Scream series just piss me off. But this doesnt, and it wont you either! All of the acting in this movie is fantastic. The only thing that really made me give this 4 stars was the fact that one of the mutants in the hills was actually kind and caring...what the hell is up with that? Anyway, if you like movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn, and Cabin Fever then this is for you."
4,"Fun, gory ride!","This will be short and to the point. If you like blood and gore, then at least rent this movie or just buy it. Be sure to get the unrated version also. The characters might not be the smartest, but it gets very bloody and more entertaining towards the end of the film."
3,"BEWARE, THERE IS PRETTY MUCH NO EXTRA SCENES IN THE UNRATED VERSION!!","People were promised that they would get all these extra scenes according to producer Wes Craven. THERE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE AN NC-17 RATING BUT THE DIRECTORS HAD TO CUT IT OUT.THERE WAS PROBABLY 5 SECONDS MORE OF EXTRA FOOTAGE!I OFFICIALLY HAD IT WITH THESE STUPID UNRATED TITLES.THIS WAS THE ONLY (HORROR) MOVIE THIS YEAR THAT WAS PROMISED TO HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA FOOTAGE BUT OF COURSE IT DIDN'T.AS THE FOR THE FILM, IT HAD DECENT ACTING BUT SOME SCENES WERE TO FAR-FETCHED. IT WASN'T BAD NOR GOOD, IT WAS ALL RIGHT."
1,Why?,"First, I have to admit I'm not a horror fan but I am a fan of great plots. This movie has a very generic plot. ""Monsters"" attacking people. This movie is all about shock value and gore, which I see no point in. With all the great reviews, I sat through this waste of time waiting for a great twist at the end. There was none. The people got away. Wow! To enjoy the movie just a little more I've come up with my own ending...The little girl who saves the baby lives. The baby's father is grateful to the little girl. The family's trailer & truck are blown up so they have no way to leave. The little girl brings the family into the hills to live.This ending would have provided the happy ending, the needed plot twist and a better open ending for a second movie."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,This movie was sooo good. I felt soo bad for the family. The part when big Bob was at the gas station was the scariest part! The ending kind of left you hanging but the movie was soooo good! Hope this helps someone!
1,Too Brutal & Horrific,"The production values and acting were very well done, but the extensive and utterly horrific brutality and savgaery was just too much, even in today's celluloid world. I was disturbed for days after seeing it and would never recommend it to anyone with a weak stomach or a disgust for excessive gore. (PS Never saw the first and had no idea of exactly what was to transpire, and the reviews do not give a sense of the gut-wrenching horror you will see on the screen).Hollywood - please, stop!"
2,Never Again,I never want to see this movie again. It wasnt all that great! Usually my boyfriend and I buy the movies we like when they come out on DVD. My boyfriend begged me to let him buy it and I refuse. I dont even want it in my house!
3,Entertaining but very predictable,"It's hard to explain why I think it's predictable without giving away some spoilers. Suffice to say that everything you know common sense says you shouldn't do, the main characters do anyways."
3,Another wrong turn,"All the usual ingredients are here but the recipe lacks piquancy. Aja delivers nothing that we haven't seen before and his treatment of these familiar themes isn't particularly memorable either. Having said that, there's nothing badly wrong with this movie: it delivers plenty of gore and reasonable, but not memorable, levels of tension; we have the usual two-dimensional characters who are by turns incredibly stupid and quite inventive; and we have the insanely psychopathic bad guys. The problem is that I've seen it done more effectively elsewhere."
1,Frighteningly ridiculous,"This movie is shockingly stupid and a poor product.I wasted money getting this from a bargain bin. Very disappointed.Fast forwarded the last half.I must have confused this with Last House on the Left, which I've heard is not too bad for this genre.However, I wouldn't expect much from that either.Wes Craven, like Obama, is only hyped up trash."
1,WORST REMAKE EVER!,This movie is no where near as good as the original. SAVE YOUR MONEY...... PERIOD!
1,I MADE A BIG MISTAKE ($) HERE,"I really love scary flicks and since this movie had Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan, I figured it wouldn not be a piece of [...]. WRONG!I'm really disappointed by the misogynistic and violentally gory junk Hollywood is making in recent years. It's not so much I can't take gross hackings, I can. But being normal, it gets old! What I'm really sick of is the mysogonistic murder and mayhem you see in these kinds of films. And when I think this stuff is geared to the teenage demography - it probably why this country is full of violence against women and violence in general. Actually, I might have been able to take one more gross-out film like The Hills Have Eyes if it hadn't featured, once again, the violence against women. It makes me wonder about the psychological makeup of the people who write and produce these things."
1,Usual Italian-inspired crud,"Best watched while drunk, I'm guessing.Directing: Not the least bit scary. No development, no thrill, no sense of timing. It's just gore, violence, rape, violence, chase scene, violence.--- Pretty framing, but bad storytelling.Writing: Dialogue is largely noise. The characters have a cumulative IQ of around 85. The dog ""Beast"" is actually the smartest."
2,"It came quick and in good condition, but not my kind of thriller, at a certain point it's just disturbing","You'll know what i mean when you get to that part.. and no it's not the part about the dog,"
3,What's for dinner? Feel like chicken tonight?,"Chicken out on this gory thriller if you can't take extreme violence. But if you can...eat chicken tonight!I felt the actors for the family were well cast. I was surprised that Kathleen Quinlan's part was so small for such a high caliber actress. I wasn't too impressed with the acting of the cannibal family, except for the little girl. To me, she was convincing.But if your looking for a gory thrill, check this one out at least!"
2,Kind of morbid,Some parts were a little gross even for me and scary movies dont usually bother me. The overall movie was very easy to predict (family gets stuck in the middle of no where and weird mutants come and eat them) Seen too many movies like this.
2,Disappointed in the remake,"I usually like the remakes of movies better. This remake was a disappointment to me. I found it very boring and drawn out. I was watching the movie and all I could think of is when the actors will be killed next. To me, I didn't like the actors' characters of this movie. I felt nothing for them and actually found them very irritating. If you want to see a better version of this movie, see the orginal one."
2,crappy,"The movie started out very slow and had absolutly no story to it. It was very predictable.If I could ask for my money back I would do so. There was alot of blood, but it wasn't scary and had no thrill to it. sorry to say this was another flop for wes craven."
4,A little too creepy,"I thought they crossed the line when they pointed the gun at the baby. Fake or not, I just found that wrong. And raping the women in the room with the baby just crossed the line. Liked the hero doggie though."
2,Why did they film in Morocco?????????,"I guess there is not enough desert in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Utah, Colorado, Oregon, and Idaho to have film this movie here, no--they went all the way to Morocco in North Africa!! We pay to see these movies, rent them and own them yet they do not have the decency to film them where there audience is ---to give back to society, to our America/North American deserts. The American desert southwest is beautiful and much of it unspoiled. I just can't believe it was cheaper for them to film in North Africa than in Arizona or Cali....rediculous! Anyways, the 3 people I wanted to see most dead ended up alive at the end. Another terrible remake of a classic."
1,"all gore and guts, no glory...","I just finished watching this movie, and I am left feeling left down. One would think, it being Wes Craven and all, that it would have been much better. Over all, I found it sort of slow and I seemed to have missed the story line. I don't think I would recommend this one to anyone. :("
1,The Hills have Eyes,I did not even received the DVD and how amI going to review the movie. Please tell me how to.......
3,The Hills Have Eyes 2006(Remake),"The Remake while better than the original 1977 movie and it's horrible 1985 Sequel,it is still not for my tastes,the movie is ultra-violent,even for an horror movie,downright brutal.For some squeamish or weak stomached it might be too much, I have seen it once,and while I commend it for doing it's job as a Horror movie,after all your suppose to be scared,I think it goes too far and goes along with the new Saw-type Movie Generation which to me is just gore and not tasteful.You have been warned In this Remake The Hills This Time do Have Eyes!(Or should I say the Rocks have eyes or Canyons!)"
2,Rental only,"In all fairness I have not seen the original. I thought the trailer for this movie looked interesting so I decided to give it a chance when I saw the DVD on sale.This is pretty much what I feared it would be: another movie with southern yokels hunting down and torturing people for no reason (like Deliverance, Texas chainsaw massacre, southern comfort, wrong turn). Yeah, it's been done a million times.The massacre scene was really awful. This really nice family is in the middle of nowhere. The father is tied and burned to death. While the rest of the family tries to save him, the 2 mutants rape the sleeping teenage daughter. I mean come on, that's so nasty. It's not scary, it's very disturbing and not fun to watch.I can sometimes look past brutality if a movie has interesting characters and funny dialogue, but this had neither. To top it off, the ending was pretty lame."
4,Remake Much Better than Original!,"I remember Craven's original The Hills Have Eyes movie. It definately left an impression on me back in the day.Something that is hard to do in this genre.But just as I thought I grew out of horror films, due to them mostly geared towards teens and have mostly just become stupid gore fests.But this remake by a tlented french director took me by storm. As it obviously did tons of other viewers. The breakthrough director of the French foreign film, High Tension, proves that he knows how to direct a solid horror film. Not with just depending on blood and gore, but suspence and good storylines and good casting.Now I'm looking forward to horror movies again. Like Hills Have Eyes 2."
4,Good deal for blu-ray,"Couldn't find Hill have eyes at ANY store. For the price of one, you get both. I really only wanted the number 1 but to get both on blu- ray, GREAT!"
5,"Good movie, Don't buy second though",Awesome movie. Way better than the second. I don't know why most sequels tend to be so lame.
1,Crossed a Line for Me,"I love horror movies, even badly done ones can be funny and amusing. There was a scene in this that nearly made me vomit, and it was not because of realistic blood and guts - it had to do with violent sexuality and children. A baby and teenager being involved in a brutal rape scene is just vulgar. Is that really necessary? The only reason a screaming baby would be there is to make it more sickening, c'mon! I watch scary movies for fake blood and guts, not to start thinking about child molestation and traumatized babies. That one scene completely left me thinking nothing but bad things. I don't even remember the rest of it well enough to review it. If you're a woman that's been a victim of any sexual violence, or a mother this scene will likely be too much for you. I just want to write this to save someone else being as bothered as I was. Some of us just can't handle something along these lines."
2,Just another slasher flick,I love a good horror movie and I love gore too but this movie seemed like it was just going through the motions. Same old story of a family stuck and attacked and killed one by one. Nothing new to add and how many times in a horror movie recently have we seen someone's fingers chopped off? It's been done. It had nothing new to add.I hope Hollywood keeps making this type of movie in the future because surely there is a market for ir but how about a better script?And the worst part? they leafve it open for a sequel! That gets a start taken away right there.
3,"I didn't want to see this, tired of remakes of cult movies - bu this one is good","The formula is easy, take a sloppy b-movie cult movie that has generated a built in audience, remake it with a bigger budget, and use a director who knows his style and sell the whole package as re-imagining terror fest!But damn it, curiosity always get the better of me, and I always have to see these movies to see how they compare to my treasured originals.The movie itself, is a very polished and slick, the second half in waaaaay better than the first, quite gory and intense but not really scary at all.Of course, the unrated DVD is much better than the rated theartrical version.Well executed film, has a formula - but it works better than other remakes due to its intensity.Yes, worthy of a least a spin."
1,The Worst!!!!,"I coudn't get thru the whole movie after the rape, and the breastfeeding I had to turn off!!! Do not buy! I found this movie totally disgusting and it made me sick for days. I love horror movies thats all I watch, this movie gives good horror movies a bad name."
1,Just another stupid horror movie.....,"All you will find is no script, most of the cast getting killed, and really gross effects.Like I said, STUPID."
2,"somewhat entertaining, but still really stupid.","This movie was only slightly better than your basic horror cliche; the nuclear testing/mutant premise seemed promising, but all the main characters were stupid/annoying. Seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters, the script-writers/director threw in lots of unnecessary gore. For the most part, though, the special effects were at least well-done; however, a few of the effects were somewhat misguided. For instance, blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red; wouldn't it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat?? Acting was mediocre. I've never seen the original, so I cannot say whether this is better or worse. The movie is not for the faint-of-heart simply because of the gore, but it definitely wasn't very scary. Two stars."
2,Utterly dissapointed,"I was really excited to see this film, however I turned it off after an hour because I was so angry. Not only did this movie tick me off, it made me want a refund for my rental because it was so utterly stupid! The director did a great job making you cheer for certain characters, only to find them dead within 10 minutes of the beginning.... the characters you hate are the ones who actually survive more than 20 minutes into the film. Don't waste your time or your money..."
1,"Not as advertised, plus very poor customer service from Factory Depot","These laser ink cartridges were advertised as compatible with the Epson CX11NF, but they are NOT.I bought three of these cartridges for my Epson CX11NF. I've never had problems with a laser cartridge I've bought directly from EPson (OEM cartridges). These, however, will not work in my printer. Unfortunately, the retailer also will not take them back (although Amazon is attempting to help me with that.) I'm very disappointed.If you have an Epson CX11NF, please be advised that these may not work for you either, and the retailer is inflexible about returns despite what I believe to be false advertising."
5,SATAN IS REAL,"This is country gospel, pure and redolent as the ever blossoming banks of the mighty river of Jordan. Ira and Charlie Louvin tender God's word in nervous but beautiful aching harmony, like two falling angels pleading to rise. Their songs are sermons to themselves and fellow sinners reprimanding all unchaste impulse and the knowing twitch of an unwholesome eye. Highly recommended to brothers and sisters intrested in redemption."
1,Morally despicable garbage.,"Would you torture a rat? Of course not, that would be cruel. Elementary animal rights tell us not to do this. But the Louvins are threatening with eternal hellfire and talks about Gods love. Clearly, the Hindus and the Buddhists and the Atheists don't deserve the same respect as a rat. Wanna hear about the joy of praising Jesus when he tortures other people? Then go ahead, buy this, you might like the harmonies. Personally, it makes me sick."
4,Ira and Charlie stomp Satan's jeweled crown flat,"This is such sincere music - It's not the very best quality production, at time it's downright campy, but you can certainly feel the conviction in Ira and Charlie Louvin's voices in this collection of country gospel. Perhaps you've been sheltered from the experience of attending a revival meeting on a hot summer night in a little Baptist church - This is what it sounds like when they have the 'special music'. For example, check out the organ accompaniment on ""The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea"", or the spoken 'testimony' during the title track.The Louvin Brothers set the standard for harmony singing in the genre, and indeed it's mighty good here, as they confront the Prince of Darkness himself. Good stuff."
5,Great Timer,"I have used this Game Timer for both chess and scrabble and it works like a charm! It has loads of options that make the old game of scrabble something new and exciting, with time pressure. Very sturdy and is holding up under much abuse.Highly recommended if you are looking for a digital clock."
2,difficult to use,this is a nice little unit but very difficult to use...one small mistake and the whole thing is a disaster...good luck.
5,One of L'Amour's best.,THis book has some good twists in it to keep the reader's attention and is still in the L'Amour style.
4,Utah Blaine 4 stars,Enjoyed the pace. Very tense at times.. Always love Mr. L Amour s stories. I rate the book at a 4
2,Typical L'Amour fare,Story uses a common L'Amour template of 'good guy gives numerous breaks to bad guys who then chase him and kill his friends and damn near kill him.' It gets boring quickly with the repetition.
2,The worst of louis l'amour,"This story is so corny, it was one of l'amour's earliest books and in no way up to par for him after having written Hondo, utah blaine walks from old mexico to the center of arizona and saves an old rancher from hanging, talks the rancher into making him the manager of his ranch and has only been there a few days and knows the whole territory and blah blah blah. I have read most of Mr. L'amour's books and liked them all until this one, save your money and time."
5,AWESOME,Love the book great title and awesome storyline love the characters especially Utah blanie wasn't a fan of Nevers or Fox
4,Another great book,"Having read other books by louis lamour, this one just continued with the great work that he has been doing. Thoroughly enjoyed this one"
4,good read,"Read the book on my Kindle and found it to be a really good story with good folks, A story that was easy to follow."
5,AKC Dog Plush,"AKC Dog Plush toys are the best! We have 2 dogs, a Grand dog, and a niece dog - all who go crazy over them. Our dogs usually destroy any toy, but the worse they can do is remove the noisy squeaker. (Some dogs actually enjoy the noise.) I would recommend this brand to anyone. They do come in different sizes, even special ones for puppies."
5,One of the best books yet written on the Christian faith.,"For 2000 years the religions and philosophies of the world have assaulted the Christian faith and yet that faith still stands strong. Whether it is growing rapidly in the face of intense persecution or it is quietly easing the suffering of those in need, Christianity is a fortess in a hostile world. This book explains why. It shows point-by-point why the Christian faith stands strong amidst the utter failure of atheism, agnosticism, paganism, and other world religions. A must read for the veteran and novice apologist alike."
5,A talented songwriter,"A must have CD for anyone who enjoys great songwriting. The music is beautiful but sparse, a good backdrop for Chesnutt's powerful voice. Honesty and cynicism, hope and sadness, joy and longing: the range of emotion that come through his voice is astounding. The clever and poetic lyrics bring to mind small-town living, and are entertaining as well as thought provoking. Overall, a beautiful piece of work."
4,Well worth it.,"Having data and power in the same cable is VERY useful. Considering the advances in cabling, however, I would think that having ONLY a DB-9 serial data cable is a limitation. For example, I'm now looking for an adaptor from the DB-9 to USB. That being said, it's a very useful connector, and it DOES work with the SporTrak Pro, not just the Meridian. A data cable is included with the SporTrak Pro, but not an external power cable. There is a less expensive power cable, but if you want to have both power and data, this is the only way to go, since there's only one connection on the GPSR."
3,cable for Magellan Meridian,"My old cable broke with out much use so, I had to buy this one it works as the old one did before it broke."
1,Disappointed,"I just ordered my third one of these. The first two just quit working. I called Magellan tech support (clearly handled from Asia, by the way) both times and after a lot of diagnostic work was told my cable was no good.Another irritation: why use a serial port connection? My laptop does not have a serial port so I have had to buy a cumbersome adapter (not cheap) that is itself finicky. Why not USB?"
5,"brian wilson,s masterpiece","I love this box set it is one of the great box sets out there today. It is better then anything the beatles ever did. there,s a lot of behind the scenes type things like brian,s demo for don,t talk, as well as rehearsels that are just instrumental, really good stuff, i highly recommend this set."
5,Essential and Beautiful,"There are very few albums in all of popular music which are this good, and this timeless. This has been one of my favorite works since it was originally released.The box set of Pet Sounds is tremendous. It gives the original mono, the stereo remix, and best of all--many studio takes, edits, and some spontaneous happenings. Most albums don't deserve this treatment, but the quality of this music is so high that it is a real treat to hear how much of it unfolded. I have a musical background (opera), but I don't think that that is necessary to love this box set. My favorite tracks are the vocal solos on disc 3--if anyone wants to hear divine melodies and harmonies, here they are, pure and elegant.This album is very personal--and it speaks to me every time I hear it. I am not sure why I find it so moving. My thanks to Brian Wilson."
5,Creative True Music,This is one the best rock Albums ever done. Bands Today cannot make this kind of Music. This is a must for a person who knows true pop.
1,IT IS A HORRIBBLE GAME!,The graphics stink and you have no clue how to run the plays.I was soooooo dissapointed. Wait for another football game to come out!
1,Disappointing,"Not what I expected for $.... Blocky graphics that take me back to the days of Colecovision. Even if you are remotely interested in this one, wait a month til it's on the 9.99 rack. I want my money back!"
4,great game!,i recentally bought this game for my son and he loves it! he plays i 24/7.i think every mother shuld buy it for a person they know1
3,asked for a book of hydrotherapy,A month ago I ordered the book but I have not recived. I have a note that the book would arrive on the 12th of April. I wonder how long it might take longer to get to my house.Thank you.
5,The best purse/diaper bag!!!,"The picture shown does not do this bag justice. I'am a first time mom and when I had my daughter I put away the coach purse and moved on to a Eddie Bauer diaper bag, which was fine but then I realized between my stuff and her's it wasn't enough.I was on the hunt for a purse/diaper bag and I didn't want any type of bag that looked like a diaper bag so I went online and read the review's and bought the Mid City tote it is wonderfull it fit's my check book,wallet,key's and most of all I don't have to clip a phone on my bag and ruin it any more. The conveinent phone holder is great. I would recommend this bag over and over."
3,good for 6 months or so,"I loved this bag! I am not the baby so I did not want to carry around a baby print bag. Unfortunately this bag did not hold up... The strap litterally just pulled out on one side. There was no unusual wear and tear on this bag, in fact we had another diaper bag we used as well so this one wasn't even used everyday. I am dissapointed that this bag barely made it past my little one's 6 mos bday..."
2,Doesn't hold up,I got this bag before my babies were born and it fell apart by the time they were 6 months. I treat things very well but the straps literally pulled off of the bag. I had to get another bag as this one could not even be fixed by a cobbler. I can't recommend this bag because it is not very good quality.
2,Remember that your husband might end up carrying this...,"This was a great diaper bag...except that the routine my husband and I developed was that I always ended up carrying the baby and he always carried the diaper bag. He didn't mind carting it around once in a while, but after a while he began to protest that he was always carrying a purse around. :) We ended up getting a more unisex looking model that both of us liked.(Also, this doesn't have a refrigerated compartment, which is important if you're carrying stored breastmilk)."
2,"Looks good and roomy, But..","My sisters free hospital bag lasted longer.I loved the look of this bag. Read good reviews online, checked it out in store and then registered for it. Was happy to get it at my baby shower. I was also very happy with all it's features and large compartments, up until about 7 months in. The straps started tearing out. And I probably used it a a lot less than the average customer, I only used it about 3-4 times a week! I was thinking if I spent a little more on a better bag... it would last longer and not have to be replaced so quickly. NOT THE CASE. Bottom line, if you have the $cash$ to replace it in 6 months or Less, go for it. P.S. Just saw 3 more customer reviews with the same problem."
4,Stylish yet useful,"Let me begin by saying how excited I was to get this bag. I hated the thought of having to tote around some plastic bag with cartoon characters on it, and then i found this. Most are surprised that it is even a diaper bag. My husband won't carry it because it looks more like a bag/purse and he doesn't want to risk his masculinity (I said get over it!) Anyay, it looks great, has lots of outside pockets and cleans easily. My only problem with the bag is that it opens to one big pocket and is not divided inside. This makes it difficult for me to find things in my bag. But I still love it!"
3,Interesting but disappointing,"""Jagged Edge"" is a good film which could have been great. Fine acting by Jeff Bridges & Glenn Close, as we have come to expect. The story could have been improved by better character development, and less predictability."
3,a mystery of lies,"This plot has been recycled at least twice with sex roles reversed at least once.The rich spouse is killed by the husband / wife and the defense lawyer is seduced by the killerso that the laywer gets the killer off only to find that becausethe facts come out the lawyer ( sometimes detective) is next on the death list.This version is fair to well done and the acting is very good.Since the plot is recycled from a movie that did it betternot ten years ago, the result is nothing to write home about."
3,"""Foolish Pleasure""","Glenn Close plays a brilliant lawyer who screws up - twice - once as a prosecutor and once as a defense attorney - by being too good at what she does.She has a struggle with her conscience before taking the case presented to her, since she has decided trial law doesn't agree with her, but is persuaded by what she perceives as the facts of the case. She consults an old friend, who has also a been detective before he retreated too far into his cups; she has worked with him before and trusts his instincts. Nonetheless, after bouncing the details off him, she decides to trust her own this time and go with it anyway. Besides, Jeff Bridges is devastatingly good looking and has a stable full of horses to boot - so even though combining business with pleasure is rarely a good idea, she decides to go for it.It was a good enough movie but I felt neither of them lived up to what I had seen them do before in their roles. But hey, the scripts for ""Fatal Attraction"" don't come along every day."
3,Insulting Murder Thriller,"I hadn't seen this in years, back then Fatal Attraction etc... many of these types of murder mystery, crimes of passion flicks came out via trends. This movie is just OK, it's insulting based on storyline that involves a defense attorney who sleeps with her potential murderer defendant etc. It's really pretty damn weak writing... I kind of regret buying this but I guess it just reminds me of that time in life when it hit cable TV."
4,The script that made Joe Eszterhas famous.,"Forget Showgirls and Sliver, and Flashdance, and Basic Instinct, Jagged Edge gave Big Joe his bones, his legitimacy.A good suspenseful thriller, a bit dated, a trifle cliché (the suspect's wife had been sleeping with the country-club tennis pro, of all things), but well-paced, and well-acted.Glenn Close takes her place in rarefied air here, the strong, but attractive adult female lead. An air uninhabited in film throughout the 90s..Susan Sarandon may try best to fill this spot, but she is nowhere near the attractive, desirable lead that Close was during this period.Beautiful Bay-area landscapes only add to the overall package.I wouldn't rate this high in the genre, but I see absolutely no reason to diss it either.A solid overall effort."
3,"engaging, but neither memorable nor a candidate for re-watch","This film has a lot going for it. The cast is absolutely superb, with Bridges as a mysterious and charming defendant who seduces his lawyer, Close. The lawyer has many issues she is struggling with: a divorcee single mother, career choices that haunt her with guilt, and a case that saps her flagging energy. Thus, it is supposed to be a thriller with realistic people, and it succeeds at it. Unfortunately, it leaves an unsatisfying feeling at the end, which is a deus ex machina non-surprise. Nonetheless, it is pretty good, just not great.I would recommend renting this rather than guying it."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A stupid, predictable ""thriller"" which will fascinate people who have never seen a movie before, Jagged Edge not only represents 100 minutes of your life that you'll never get back but it also shot Joe Ezterhas to stardom: may God have mercy on its soul."
2,"had potential, but is a mess","This movie had a great cast, and I go for the genre in a big way, but it disappointed me. Perhaps if I had expected less from the cast I would have liked it more. The plot is laughable and unmotivated, and there are continuity errors that I found quite distracting. It is a good looking movie, though."
3,Court room hokum but ok flick,"Not as bad as BASIC INSTINCT but not as good as most court room flicks, JAGGED EDGE has the customary over the top violence and slick sex writer Mr Esterhaz peppers his slick screenplays with. Common to BASIC INSTINCT is the aim of keeping the punters guessing about who dunnit and whether HERO played by GLENNN CLOSE in some ludicrous shoulder padded power suits from the eighties will get back together with her estranged husband. Added is an unusually foulmouthed Robert Loggia. Basically its amoral rubbish with few gentleman in a sordid world of dog eat dog that will keep you awake but leave you with a sour aftertaste. Freud might point out to the writer that he seems to have some trouble with Daddy, didn't like Mummy much and California is a rich kids play pen where selfish people do what they can to get ahead, including sending innocent black men to gaol to get elected as DA. I went cycling and had a swim after this film. YUKKKK."
4,"nice product, good price","Bought several essential oils from this company- pleased with product, shipping, price. Will order similar products from this company again."
2,Third Distillation,Remember that this is third distillation ylang ylang. First distillation is far better (and far more expensive). Second distillation is better.
2,Not the smell I expected,"Seller shipped quickly and arrived without incident.Not the scent I expected. It smells like lilies.To me lilies smell horrible and remind me of death.Many people do like lilies. If you're one, you'll probably love the smell.In fact, if you enjoy the smell of lilies than this oil is for you! Fast and easy delivery too.I was looking for a nice floral scent to add to my homemade laundry detergent. I'm going to have to order something else. I don't think it's worth it to pay return shipping. Now trying to give the oil away!"
1,Not like Fresh Rosemary,"I ordered the Aura Cacia Rosemary essential oil and I'm actually sending it back to the company. Although their lavender, tea tree and eucalyptus smell true, the rosemary smells more like the woody stems then the leaves. Pretty disappointing."
4,Aromatherapy only,"Aura Cacia are largely good quality essential oils, good for external aromatherapy purposes only. We use a couple drops of essential oil per litre of homemade seltzer for flavoring. This isn't good for that particular purpose [you know, the reason I bought it?] Now Foods essential oils are better for flavoring use. I'll still use this oil for soaps, mists and in my vessel, but it won't be passing my lips. They don't mention this in the description. Aura Cacia peppermint oil can be consumed, but would make a nasty seltzer [perhaps]."
4,"Simple, yet effective abdominal workouts for all levels.","This tape is good for those who can spare 10 minutes each day to work on their abdominals, while learning the basics of good form and pace. From beginners to advanced participants, it provides enough intensity to make a real difference. What I liked most about this video is the chance to mix and match the ab routines; I can go longer one day (20-30mins.), or do the minimum the next (10mins.). The isometric portion was a bit slow, but it made me aware that exercising abs can be done anywhere, anytime."
1,Waste of money,I bought this video 1 year back and there is no improvement in the way me abs look. There are 3 sections in this video 10 mins each.
5,Ayn Rand,"Excellent video, love it. I been looking to get this for a while. Good info pre purchased so that is why finaly i made up my mind to get it.Received this product a day before it was estimated due. Great service."
4,Great overview,The content that was in the documentary was well delivered ad extremely informative. But the DVD is damaged and it skips over the damaged portions very annoying.
5,Rave review for Rand doc,This is a great documentary to view regardless of your view of Ayn Rand and Objectivism. If you happen to be reasonable enough to see the incredible value of her life then this will bring even greater enjoyment to you.
5,"Now, here is something you will really like!","I have been reading Ayn Rand books since I was in high school. I have found Ayn's works refreshing and enlightening. Considering all the collectivist in our country, we need an inspiration for the indivdual. For the individual who gave this movie one star, I am sure you were thinking on your own, yeah right! Oh well, you have the right to your own opinion, thanks to people like Ayn. This is a must see, and her books are a must read!"
5,Worthy hymn to the greatest thinker ever,"A Sense of Life is for anyone who has an interest in philosophy, which, in its broadest sense, should be anyone who is alive! The documentary is very well made and, to my knowledge, also very factual."
4,Almost every song on this soundtrack is fantastic!,"Another old favorite of mine, this soundtrack combines many different styles of music. Garbage, which is one of my favorite groups, appears on the very first track with their now-famous ""#1 Crush"" (Think: ""I would die for you, I would die for you..."".) And this is also the CD that made the Cardigan's ""Lovefool"" (Think: ""Love me, love me, say that you love me..."") a hit. Des'ree's romantic ""Kissing You"" will remind you of everything the Romeo and Juliet legacy stands for, and other songs such as Kim Myzelle's ""Young Hearts Run Free"" and the Wannadie's ""You and Me Song"" will make even the shyest among you start dancing! Mundy's ""To You I Bestow"" is very romantic and noble. This is not one of those soundtracks with one good song worth listening to and the rest throw-away-able. Almost every song is great, and this is a CD you will want to hold on to- I know because I have had it for a really long time. :)"
4,Of the much better soundtracks.....,"This is an excellent album. Tracks 1,5,7,9,12 and especially 11 are great. Radiohead and Garbage, two very popular alternative bands, contribute great examples of their talent (11+1). Des'Ree preforms an amazing love ballad with ""Kissing You"" (track 5), using her beutiful voice and a lovely back-up piano. Little Star (track 12) is also very nice and very relaxing. Many of the other songs that I didn't mention above were not very memorable, but not bad to listen to. I only dislike tracks 4 and 13, but that is not to say that they are not enjoyable to fans of that sort of music. Track four is very hard rock, unlike most of the rest of the album. Romeo and Juliet is one of the best soundtracks I own. Also, if you like soundtracks, check out ""Go"", ""Stigmata"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer-The Album""(TV show soundtrack, not movie)"
5,a wild sexy romp,This lusciously designed soundtrack copies the sexy atmosphere of Leonardo dicapprios orgasmic performance as sir Romeo. I have bought numerous copies ofthis album as i fond its the greates compilation ever to be birthed!!!!!even better than the godthumb sountrack (another must have)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@$#&
3,Definitely worth a listen.,"I could of given it five stars based on the strength alone of Talk Show Host, which in my mind is the best track off the soundtrack, and one of my favorite Radiohead songs. Hell, it was probably one of the only reasons I purchased this album in the first place - haunting, and intense. The pumping rhythyms and deep, throaty melodies of I Would Die For You is also quite memorable. Other than these two, which were the standouts, it's a solid but standard alternative/modern rock/pop album. Enjoyable, but except for a song or two, nothing below the surface."
3,"The great, the good, the rest...","How often do we buy soundtrack albums for one great song and figure out the rest of the album seems to be coasting on the legend of that one song? I'd say pretty often, and exhibiting that phenomenon more than most records is Romeo and Juliet, a huge hit probably because ""#1 Crush""'s success as a single. That song is one of Garbage's best, full of desire so dark, it threatens to kill more than it threatens to love. It's a visceral masterpiece, and the rest of the album is just sorta there around it. Mundy's ""To You I Bestow,"" Radiohead's ""Talk Show Host,"" and the Cardigan's ""Lovefool"" are good enough songs, but for the most part, it just seems to fill space (do you honestly remember any of Gavin Friday's ""Angel"" or Everclear's ""Local God"" when thinking of this cd?)."
4,good and bad,u know i'd have to say that this is a very good CD with Crush as my favorite and the one that i actually wrote. Like the movie it is marvelous(i am a goddesss and i have blonde hair and jade eyes) and i really like this fabulous four star CD.
2,A few bright spots in an otherwise dull collection,"""Romeo + Juliet"" is an occasionally entertaining but overall weak soundtrack to a movie that's....well, occasionally entertaining but overall weak. The only remarkable tracks on the album are Garbage's ""#1 Crush"" (one of the best remixes ever made, courtesty of Nellee Hooper), Radiohead's ""Talk Show Host"" (the rare Radiohead track whose experimentation actually results in a good song), and the Cardigans' ""Love Fool"" (a guilty pleasure in every sense, and still insanely catchy). Just about every other song on the album is blah, bizarre, or both....and almost completely forgettable. Give this one a try, but don't expect it to be a keeper."
5,i thought the cd was good.,"the second sound track to romeo and juliet was good.i just didnt really like how it had some of the words to the movie.but it didnt make it horrible.other wise,the cd was the bomb!"
1,Horible Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is not worth the money. The songs on it are not worth the time it takes to listen to them. Don't even consider buying it. All the songs are boreing and drawin out, not to meantion. Listinging to this is like having a baby wining in your ear."
4,Even with one song...,"Not the greatest soundtrack ever, but the Radiohead track alone makes this CD worth buying, even if you have to pay $20"
4,Love it,"I would give it a 5 except it doesnt have the song ""When Doves Cry"" like it had in the movie. Other wise I love this soundtrack."
5,R&J #1 IS AWESOME TOO!!,"I have both R+J 1 and 2, both are wicked cool!! If you have one you gotta have the other! If you have niether, start ordering them both!!!!"
5,Two Songs are Awesome here..,"Of course the sweet song 'Kissing You' is awesome. But what really gets to me is that song 'Everybody's Free' by the child Quindon Tarver. His pure, passionate rendition of that song just brings tears to my eyes. Very soul-stirring. I'm gonna search for more music by him."
4,It's...a soundtrack,"In a time when most soundtracks are better than most studio albums, this album runs this concept to the ground. Talk show host is my favorite radiohead song, local god is the best everclear song, and whatever (I had a dream)is the best butthole surfers song. This album has ""taken it to the street be-otch (if you own it you'll understand)"
1,dont waste your money,"i bought this led for my project i was working on and i connected it to the wires and the led blew up in my face, a shard of the plastic bulb flew in my eye and got lodged in it while it was burning hot, so my left eye ball suffered 3rd degree burn and a puncture, thankfully it wasnt my cornea that got hit but i got my medicade to pay for it and im on welfare and lost my job from so many days out and all of this was caused by this led light"
2,No grey areas at all,"2.5 starsThis was an interesting idea but was not well-developed or executed. It also has pretty extreme portrayals of men and women: complete evil vs. complete good. Please. This is terribly naive.(Plus it's more than a bit incestuous, but I guess less so than the Bible.)"
4,Daughters Series,"Coral Dawn shows the initiative of woman to move off earth and start their own world.The characters are great, but the book is a little short."
2,Not up to her standard,"I adore Katherine Forrest's mysteries and Curious Wine is simply exquisite and I'm an SF fan, so it seemed like this would be a perfect match, but I'm afraid to say this novel was very disappointing. It felt very dated and cliche. The story moved at an insane speed with little or no support for some jumps of plot and logic. A good SF novel uses the alternative setting to free readers from expectations, but needs to have a logic in and of itself, but this felt like the SF backdrop was an excuse for implausable deus ex machina jumps in the plot. Very much ""it doesn't have to make sense, it's SF."" Still, this is a classic of lesbian feminist utopian fiction and it was worth reading on that level."
5,Making Promises,"Crossed Signals...Monica Ford's interests are strictly professional when she volunteers to work at WKND, the Kennedy High School radio station. Then she meets Peter Lacey, the WKND d.j., and discovers they're on the same wavelength.Peter knows he's falling for Monica. But he's promised to be faithful to his girlfriend, Lisa, who's at Olympic training camp in Colorado. So he tells Monica that they'll have to stay ""just friends.""Monica admires Peter's loyalty, but she can't forgive him for leading her on. Will Peter's promise of long ago destroy a chance at new love?"
4,BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!,"The bonus track on this album is NOT a new track called ""Sweet Love"" as often reported but in fact just her 1986 classic ALMAZ. Naturally there is no Japanese translation of ""Almaz"" so it was retitled ""Sweet Love"" for Japan. I already owned the US edition and bought this for what I thought was a rare Japanese only track..."
4,Halloween Circus Music,"Awesome CD, we created a clown room in a haunted house this year and had this CD to fill in for sound affects. We could here folks several rooms away talking about clowns before they got to our room b/c of the music!Must buy!"
1,It has no air circulation.,"This product has almost no air circulation. So, of course, it's quiet but I don't see how it can be doing any air cleaning. You have to take out the filter to use the fragrancer, so it's either a fragrancer or an air purifier. If you use the ozone, it gets the bleachy smell fast and doesn't seem to clear up any odor very well. I wouldn't recommend this product. I'm not even sure why they made it in the first place."
2,Disappointing,"Sorry to disagree with the majority on this one. It started off well but soon descended into drek. The author seemed to be trying way too hard to create a magical-mystical Celtic creature out of her protagonist (who really was nothing more than a selfish girl who wanted her way at any cost). Kathryn Harrison didn't succed in glorifying incest (IMO), and neither can McBride. If you want good Irish lit, go back to Joyce or read Jane Urqhart, William Trevor, etc."
4,very good read,"This is a very enjoyable book which mixes the magic and mystery of Ireland, spirits, and selkies into one story about a girl growing up and searching for information about her parents' identities and her own. Even though her mother is alive for much of the story, she isn't forthcoming with details, and Clodagh feels she hardly knows her mother, especially her mother's past. Clodagh's dead twin sister often feels as if she too is nearby. The truth about her parents, and also herself, comes as a surprise."
3,Juliette is Scary,"I'm not going to get too deep here. I liked it. I like her rock persona. If this was a movie Juliette would be the one who pulls a knife on the drunk guy who hits on her girl friend. I don't know, that image just sprung to mind. She's scary!"
2,sexploitation,"Songs full of moaning, heavy breathing and sexual innuendo, none of which requires much talent. This is unfortunate, because this band actually shows potential. I'd like to hear them working with better material."
5,Juliette lewis rocks it out,"Juliette Lewis is my favorite actress and singer ever her band is awsome,i bought her soundtrack ""Like a Bolt of Lightning"" and i reserved her new soundtrack ""You""re Speaking My Language"".Also i got tickets to her concert at ""The Magic Stick""In Detriot MI.And finally im going to see Juliette Lewis for the first time in my life ever.Her soundtracks rock and she rocks."
4,Great...,"I liked this book a lot. It had enough action to keep me going, unlike book 10 and book 14!The only problem I had was with Qui-Gon. Personally, I don't believe that Qui-Gon would want vengeance for Tahl. It's bad characterization, and it makes the story less believable.Another thing... Where is Obi-Wan in the Jedi APPRENTICE series? If they wanted it to be all about Qui-Gon, they should have named it The Jedi MASTER series!"
2,depressing...,"It gets two because it's Jude Watson, that's all. This is probably my least favorite of all the Jedi Apprentice, and in it, Qui-Gon behaves in a way that is not only unJedi-like, but unlike Qui-Gon as well. I could write him better than that, and I'm no professional writer."
4,Ultra Lounge is fun,"Again, as with my other Ultra Lounge purchases, these compliations are great fun to mix together on your ipod and have drinks with friends on the patio during a hot summer night."
2,Where's the Sax?,"Another get what you pay for thing. There is so much other instument accompaniment, the sax gets lost, few of these songs feature the sax and many times it is subdued. This could have just as easily been called Bongo-phobia."
5,Respects young adults' ability to comprehend complex topics,"Raised in Oklahoma City, Ralph Ellison studied classical music but was also immersed in jazz. He dropped out of Tuskegee Institute for lack of funds, and moved north to Harlem in 1936, where he was nudged toward writing by friends like Langston Hughes and Richard Wright. Infusing both his love of music and his voracious reading habit into his writing, Ellison created a uniquely American kind of prose in his seminal novel, INVISIBLE MAN.This is the newest offering in Morgan Reynolds' ""World Writers"" series, and as always, the author treats young adults with respect and assumes them capable of comprehending complex topics and times."
1,NOT AS PICTURED!!!,"The item that Amazon has pictured is model# 1183. Model# 1181 is the same as model# 1178. The only difference is that model# 1181, includes the technical data printed in french and english. Model# 1178 is printed in english only. This may explain why the description states ""Canada Only"". Why pay the extra cost to receive the owner's manual in french and english. I have pointed this error out to Amazon, but it appears they're not willing to correct their error.Model# 1183, which Amazon has pictured, has the additional feature of FM radio. The buyer would not be aware of this issue unless they had research the manufacturer's web site. Buy model# 1178 instead and avoid the nightmare of trying to explain to Amazon that they are at fault. Since I purchased this item through a thrid party seller recommended by Amazon, I won't burden you with details of what they're asking me to do to return for a refund! Just avoid this item all together!!"
1,Poor quality product.,"I liked those sunglasses until the temple tips started to fall apart, this is some sort of problem with the plastic they used. I have seen other reviews complaing about the same defect.Tried to call for warranty service sending e-mails and got no answer at all.This is my second Ray-ban sunglass that has manufacturing problems. The other one had issues on the lenses.Will never purchase from them again!!!"
4,Close to perfect!,"These sunglasses are great. I've had mine about 5 years now. The other review is correct about the silicone/plastic ear tips - they dry rot within about 4 years. I could not find replacement tips anywhere - not even from the Ray-Ban site. I just bought a pair of $5 specials that looked like they would work and pulled off the tips and put them on my Ray-Bans. Not perfect, but it extended the life another year before the ear frame piece broke (today! rats!).In spite of these drawbacks, I'm buying another, identical pair. What can I say; they look great and I like how the lenses don't re-color the scene. Maybe this time I'll wipe some Armor All on the ear tips every now and then."
5,i have waited 28 years for this one....,"i first saw this movie when it was released in 1971 and it blew me away. i have waited 28 years to find it on video. in around 1985 i stumbled on it on late-night tv, about a third of the way thru and taped what was left....the movie had that much of a pull on me. hoffman is brilliant as a bob dylan-like, aging rock star who has everything and nothing. terrific writing all the way thru, the film blends music, psychoanalysis, lament and comedy."
5,The saddist movie I ever saw. Dustin Hoffman is tormented,"This is the story of George Soloway ( Dustin Hoffman ) a sucessful songwriter who despite his financial sucess can't get the bugs out of his head. All he asks for is "" Just 1 minute without fear ""which his shrink considers a ridiculas request. A good study on tormant and maybe we are that much alone. A self absorbed, self centered self destructive song writer who can't even sleep. We've all had those moments but not lived that life. This movie always made me wonder ... should I feel blessed or just jump off a bridge. Well you won't get any answers here."
1,"Pretty pathetic, definitely a waste of time","I'm a big Hoffman fan, but this one was a stinker. A very generic scriptwith big stereotypes about rock stars, psychiatrists, squares, etc. Very dated and very dull and boring. A lot of scenes where they just let the camera roll on and on while nothing is happening and the dialog goes nowhere. Hoffman's performance is pretty poor, but basically it's not his fault, because there was nothing to work with and I don't know what the point was. I turned it off halfway thru b/c it was too pathetic to watch."
4,Great help for the CT Registry,"Although a little outdated, many of the questions in the registry were straight out of this book. I used this book along with Seeram-CT Principles, Applications & Quality Control and the MIC Registry Review. I recently passed the registry first time. I took the practice exams in this book and then looked up the questions that I had difficulty with in Seeram. I found that this had prepared me enough for the registry exam. I would reccommend this book combined with these other sources mentioned."
2,CT experience,"I recently purchased this book and took the registry just 2 days ago. All the reviews I've read said that this was THE book to have and 80% of the questions appeared on the registry. This was not the case for me, unfortunately. I know there are several CT registries out there and quite possibly for some of them this book would be sufficient , however, I didn't find it in my case. The book was beneficial in that it mentally prepared me for answering all those questions and keeping my mind open but questions from this book did not appear on the registry."
4,Good Book,"I used this book to prepare for my CT registry. It was not the only book that I used but I felt that it was very helpful. I took, and passed, my registry in October 2006. This book contained a lot of questions that I actually had on my registry. Also this book has a lot of anatomy questions and there was a lot of anatomy on the registry. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
2,Not Really Helpful,"I practically memorized this book. There were only about 5 questions on the registry that were in this book. I found it was VERY outdated. It did help with how the test is outlined, but as for it's content it wasn't helpful at all. I found it overpriced for a thin paperback."
2,Maybe after taking a CT review class...,"Silly me, I followed the advice of others and ordered this book without taking any review classes. It is great if you have already learned everything you need to know for the registry, and need a light review of test questions, but if you have yet to come that far - this is NOT the book for you. If you do not understand why you answered a question incorrectly - too bad! There is no explanation, so you are on your own. CT class first - then this book of questions."
3,A good place to start,"Gets the technologist ready for the CT board type questions that will be on the registry. However, I would highly recommend this be as a supplement to other readings such as the MIC and Romans books/study guides because there are some concepts and theories that are just not covered. Good Luck!"
3,Outdated,"I bought this book with high expectations. With a new CT, the applications person found many inaccurate/outdated answers. This book has still given me the basic items I need to study for the registry."
5,this is a great book,"this book helped me a lot ...a lot of the question were in the registry, but in different format....this is a must if you are planning of taking the C.T exam. A+++++++"
