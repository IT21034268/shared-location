2,Very complex,"Ada or Ardor is a complex and long book involving an alternate world where the Victorian world is mapped onto pangea, steam punk, a complicated family tree, word play and goodness knows what else. Under different circumstances, I might have enjoyed the book but at its first reading it was too much to hold my attention. I didn't connect with the characters nor was I particularly interested in the progression of the plot."
3,a little disappointed,this stant thermostat had great reviews. i bought it based on those reviews. it looked like a quality product but i was disappointed to find out that it was made in china and not in america.
2,The book to read when all you really want is trash....,"You're tired. You want something mindless. The world is aggravating and you want an escape. Turning on the TV would just make noise. Reach for Jesus, Elvis, and Coca-Cola (who could resist the title?). Everything about the book is improbable, from the Jewish Texan cowboy private detective living and working in New York, to the ridiculous and repetitive language used (repetitively) to describe ordinary things, to the plot (which makes our hero appear to be an idiot at the same time that he solves the case). The book provides a heavy dose of cynicism about nearly everything it touches, which can be a good thing if you are in one of those moods where a positive and upbeat perspective would be just too annoying. The book is mercifully short, so that nagging feeling that you are TOTALLY WASTING YOUR TIME doesn't last much longer than the (hopefully temporary) bad mood that might have drawn you to it in the first place."
4,Funny as ever,"I have read 4 of Kinkys books in the past few months, no one is better than the other, they all include very interesting characters and come bundled together with laughs a plenty. Kinky has a wonderful habit of making the extraordinary seem very ordinary, and he gives the ordinary an added twist of the extraordinary. This book is really harmless, and it is an easy read. As it is so laid back I found myself drifting and missing key moments but it really is a wonderful book for any depressed person who needs a laugh and a new outlook."
3,Okay,"Took a while for the product to come in but everything is all good now....wish the company would give me a tracking number that worked, but came in later than expected"
3,"Good season that could have been the best ""IF""","This season, The Pearl islands, was one of the better ones of all 15 (soon to be 16) thus far.Most of the characters (except for 'Lil') had good personalities, and at least a few admirable traits (unlike Vanuatu where there were mabey 5 but they got voted out at the start.)I loved the fact that they shocked the castways with voting someone back in ! I wish they'd do that again because it can give a popular or deserving player another chance. The good part about the way it played out here was that the tall, dark haired strong guy who got sideswiped by Jonhny fairplay was voted back in, and the sad part of the way it played out was that annoying, loonie 'LIL' got voted back in.Rupert was a treat to watch, as was Sandra and most of the cast."
4,If only...,"Season 7 Pearl Islands could have been better. Oh, it already is a wonderful season and one you should definably buy if you haven't already; but this season made a huge blunder by (Spoilers) the outcast twist. Lill should have NEVER do you hear me NEVER should have come back and ruined the rest of the season. If only they did not have the outcast twist, this one would be in my top 5 (It's number 8.)P.S. Burton did come back (Yes!)"
5,Fantastic Season- Part 5 Pearl Islands,"This seems to be the best season of the series.This set will include all the episodes and some special features.This is going to be released on February 7th.PRESS RELEASESURVIVOR RETURNS IN ITS FOURTH DVD OFSURVIVOR PEARL ISLANDS- THE COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASONThis is the seventh installement of the show, but it is the fourth DVD.Here is an ordered list of DVD releases-1. Survivor: Borneo- The Complete First Season2. Survivor: All-Stars- The Complete Season3. Survivor: The Australian Outback- The Complete Second Season4. Survivor: Pearl Islands- The Complete Seventh Season5. Survivor: Palau- The Complete Tenth Season (COMING SOON)The person pictured in the center does not matter. Rupert is popular to the people and directors of this show.When this is released in a couple of weeks, I advise you to buy it. And when Palau is released in couple of months or a year, then I also adivse you to buy that.Many twists made this season cool-1. Outcast2. Rupert stealing shoes"
4,Poopert in Panama,"I love this season, not because of Rupert, but because of the better characters that wern't overrated. Sandra! Fairplay! Darrah! Burton! Also, I'm a little angry Rupert is in the top center and not Winner Sandra. Very Disrespectful. Yes, I've see the REAL box cover early.All in all, it was a great season. Purchase it! Besides, who couldn't resist to see Fairplay lie about his grandma's death....again!?"
4,Maybe my favorite season of Survivor,"Season 7 came in 2003 and no one was prepared for what was to come. When I looked at Rupert's picture, I thought he would win. He didn't but still there is proof why this season defines the word 'Survivor'-the tribes had to buy an trade items. A very good twist. Even Rupert stoled some of the other tribes' shoes!-The first time a person says 'I quit'(Osten).- Two people come back into the game.- Jon lies about his grandma's death.- Sandra wins.I was so happy when Sandra won. Lillan had immunity and she could've voted off Sandra cause then with Jon, she could easily win. THANK GOD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. If it happened, this would have been one of the most disappointing seasons.I'm looking foward to seeing the release of Season 7. I don't have any of the other DVDs but I might get this one!"
3,"Poor Quality, but fixable","at least mine was. I saw all the bad reviews and opened mine in a panic the day before I was going to give it to my daughter for her birthday. Sure enough, brand new out of the package there were fingerprints ALL over it, and sticky ones. I washed it and rubbed at it and then put it in and they all played. At least I could go thru all the chapters, I haven't actually watched the ENTIRE season yet.so-phew. But shame for selling it this way! I see now that it is not for sale. Hopefully it will come back so everyone can enjoy a little Rupert!"
5,Such a Good Survivor!!!,"I didn't start drinking the Survivor kool-aid until Season 10, and once hooked, had to watch the ones I'd missed. Pearl Islands has so many great characters, of which Rupert is the biggest character of any season -- literally and spiritually. A must-have for any Survivor fan."
2,Not full cigars but 1/2 sided,"They look good and are good chocolate, however I was using these for a retirement party for a co-worker and was sad to see they where not fully round cigars but sliced down the middle. To me that looses the effect, would have ordered something else if I would have known it wasn't listed on the site."
3,"Mr.Wilbur is off on the KFC coleslaw&biscuits,I know, did it","For the most part, Mr.Wilbur s ""secrets"" closely guarded by eateries.Tho' he is off a good country mile on KFC.Coleslaw is :shredded cabbage, carrotts,onions,bind w/Miracle Whip,sugar,cider vinegar,salt,touch of milk.3 days in fridge will last.Biscuits are:regular flour, white Crisco type shortening,use paddle of mixer, make course crumbs add leaveners,baking powder,sugar and butter-milk. Knead briefly on floured surface after all mixed. Roll out 2"" thick,brush off flour on top,won't cook in oven and tastes ugh.2""cutter,press down, twist &you seal the sides,doesn't rise evenly.350 oven and keep close together for soft sides,apart for crispy edges.Brush with butter/margerine when done--10-12 minutes."
3,"Good Approximations, But Some Recipes Miss the Mark","This book is a great way to create some pretty close ""secret recipes."" I have enjoyed many of the recipes and the history lessons. There is to much emphasis on how to stack the condiments on a burger the correct way for my tastes, but my kids have enjoyed not buying out to see how close that we can come to ""the real thing."" This has has saved money and added some quality family time. Laure'"
3,Too much hassle for a Twinkie Clone,"Some of the recipes in this book are easy to make and delicious--Mrs. Field's Cookies, Orange Julius, Dairy Queen Blizzard, Twix Bars, to name a few. But I balked when reading the ""how-to's"" of Homemade Twinkies. Who has time to roll tin foil around spice jars to use as a mold for the cake batter? Then the boring task of poking holes into each individual ""Twinkie"" and filling them up with whipped cream. I can't imagine wanting more than a couple Twinkies a year, anyway, and this recipe makes a whole bunch. However, this IS a fun book, and I imagine parents would have a great time whipping these treats up with their kids."
1,Secret Recipes not,I have tried some of the recipes and I find them dissatisfying. This weekend I tried the Pancakes from International House thinking how could this go wrong. Forget it. Even after adding an additional 1/4 cup of milk to the recipe the product was more like a biscuit than a pancake. Don't bother.
3,Non Fiction,"A fun book that looks at how to make your own home made facsimile versions of some famous junk food. At least famous in America, some of them some other people probably will not have heard of. If you want some cooking silliness, this one is definitely for you, or to throw a version of something passable by way of some of those mini-humans."
3,Top Secret Receipes,this book is great easy to use I highly recomend it the receipes are just like the restarunts
3,Recipes Need Tweaking,"Some of the recipes should be double-checked. The book is sketchy on specifics.I realize you want to use the least amount of pages for print, but the information should be expanded."
5,Excellent cook book !,Bought this to try some of the recipes and they are very good and easy to follow! Would recommend to anyone! Shipping was fast and will buy from again!
4,Fun recipies,"I've had a lot of fun with some of the recipes in this book. People have asked for the recipies of items I've taken to potlucks and BBQ's. There are a few items that don't quite hit the mark, but overall it's a good cookbook."
4,"Complex, multi-layered story","This is a marvelous novel, with three-dimensional characters and great use of language.Don't let the fact that it takes place on an all-woman world prejudice you against (or for) this book. The lack of men isn't the focus and the women are as varied as any dual-gender population can be!I'm not sure if it was the author's intention but for me, the story was really about the search for one's authentic self. I'm reaching an age (63 this year) where I'm like Marghe and Danner -- journeying into a new and strange world, wondering who I really am, searching for my true name, and nature. It was a delight to follow Marghe, Danner and the others as they found their place."
4,An excellent debut novel,"Strong characters, fast pacing and interesting biological speculations make this a recommended read"
2,Very poorly written,"It is extremely seldom that I stop reading a book because it is so bad. Ammonite is the first in years. I wanted to stop a few chapters in but, since it's my book club's selection for this month I forced myself to continue. About fifty pages from the end I was so disgusted I couldn't go on.The author gives almost no time to considering what a mono-gendered feminine society would be like. Instead she simply copies native American and Mongol cultures. You could change the names from feminine to masculine and the story would make more sense."
1,Lesbian phantasy world.,"The only reason this book got a prize, is that the category of lesbian SF is very small.The ""science"" in the book is new-age mumbo-jumbo. The book contradicts itself and is inconsistent.The story is a lesbian dream of a world with children, but without men."
3,Lesbian fantasy,"I didn't find much interesting in this novel. The characters were interesting, but their motivations were hard to understand. I liked the culture, but how it came about wasn't explained. Some questions that were asked weren't answered. If you're a lesbian, I think you'd like this novel, otherwise, don't bother."
1,Lesbian softsell,"The whole book seemed to be written for lesbian sci-fi readers. Way too much ""women ruling the world"" and doing a better job garbage. The actual sci-fi parts were good but that counted for only 30 pages or so."
4,An impressive read from a new author,"I did not know what to expect, but a book of this quality from a new author, makes me want to weep. The talent to pull off such a well thought out and introspective tale is rare. I often find myself reading the same authors for years, only to discover they have used up their imaginative fire early on. I look forward to reading more from this talented woman."
5,Gender roles.,"The author's focus on the roles people take for themselves in society, and how they deal with how well or ill those roles fit, is what makes this book so special. Ms. Griffith makes you think about yourself and all the people you interact with, while telling a tale that is impossible to put down. The only thing I disliked about this story was that it had to end!"
5,Opens up a new genre,"Before this book I never even contemplated the science fiction genre. This book is just amazing. And it's so much more then just a story about lesbians, because there really isn't any overt lesbianism until about half way through the book. However, the story deals with a lot of themes. Such as belonging, trust, heritige, change and love. I'd definantely reccammend this book"
5,Perfect for my class,Nice new condition. Perfect for my first going to college class. I got free shipping and it arrived exactly when Amazon said it would. I tell my friends to order from Amazon. Thank You.
5,"A book about tricks, trucks and pushcarts.","Want exiting, funny and just a great book? Read The Pushcart War by Jean Merrill. On a scale of one to ten I'd give it a ten. It's about the tricks trucks and pushcarts play on each other. I'd recommend this book for fourth graders and up. You'll get a kick out of this book!"
4,Remembered from childhood,"I read this book as a child, and thought of it the other day when I heard that the mayor of NY was going to war against the pushcart vendors. I have to read it again!"
5,Fine satire for kids,"Thus unique book is a triumph of understated humor. In sober tones it presents all the available documentation we have about ""The Pushcart War"" as if it were an actual event, all the while making fun of big business, corrupt government, and mass media manias. The Pushcart operators are a collection of likeable and eccentric characters. Big truck companies who are blamed for tying up traffic use pushcarts as scapegoats for the problem. One day a truck pushes a florist and his cart into a pickle barrel, as part of a campaign to get the pushcarts off the streets. The pushcarts decide to fight back with various clever strategies, and the ""war"" that ensues is engaging, memorable, and fun. (The book is not pro-war, however, so don't worry.) We need a book like this now more than ever, perhaps, as big businesses gobble up and remove character from cities nationwide."
3,The Pushcart War,"In English class, we read the book The Pushcart War by Jean Merrill. I found this book interesting, but sometimes hard to follow. The Pushcart War was a fictional war between pushcart peddlers and truck drivers. These two major sides in the war fight over who has the rights to be on the streets of New York City. In the end, you could say both sides win, but it depends on what kind of reader you are. I recommend this book to people who pay close attention to what they are reading. If you don't pay attention to this book, you will surely get confused because the events are spread out unevenly throughout the book. The Pushcart War was one of the best books I've read in awhile. So, if you're in the library, pick up and check out The Pushcart War by Jean Merrill."
3,The Vietnamese were not pushcart peddlers!,"Merrill has written an interesting, if distorted, Vietnam War allegory. The characters are enjoyable (even the bad guys, for whom I found myself rooting occasionally), and the plot is aimed and reaches its target, which is impressionable minds trying to understand the adult world.That said, however, any attempt to analogize the pushcart peddlers to the Vietnamese (as a former teacher once tried) is seriously misplaced. The peddlers didn't have Surface to Air Missiles, nor was their aim to subjugate all peddlers in New York. ""The Pushcart War"" is probably most analogous to the Gulf War, where Iraq beat up, terrorized, looted and pillaged its smaller neighbor Kuwait."
1,Don't Bother Reading It,I read this book and it isn't that funny. other friends of mine have read it and can't stand how stupid it is. it was a waste of my time for reading it
5,This was a funny book that I loved.,This was the best book I read inn years. We had to read it in school. Now we are doing a Mock Trial with this book.
5,blast from the past,"I read this as a kid, was happy to find it online so I could read it to mine. Very amusing story about the little guys standing up for themselves"
5,READ THIS BOOK,"This is my latest favorite! I read it to myself and then out loud to some of my friends and i laughed just as hard the second time. The dialogue and actions of the pushcart owners and truck drivers is well written and original. And the suspense is super. Even though the favorites win in the end you are kept guessing right to the end. Although it is fiction,it is realistic enough that it made me feel like doing some research! The plot is an exciting contest between truckdrivers and their trucks( they are too many and too big)and the pushcarts owners and their carts who are harmless and small. I would advise teachers to read it to their classes and parents to their children."
5,Not Just For Kids!,"I read THE PUSHCART WAR as part of a reading program when I was in fifth grade, and of all the books I read that year, this is the one of only two that stuck with me.In the late eighties I found the book back in print, and I snatched the copy off the shelf to read to my then-seven year-old son. When I did, I made a wonderful discovery... that THE PUSHCART WAR was even more fun to read as an adult... so much so that this book would have an impact on my own writing.THE PUSHCART WAR is not just for kids. I am in my forties now, and I still find myself going back to re-read this one. I have read it to both of my children and they love it, too. And I hope they're eavesdropping when I read it to their children -- and discover the whole subtle world of adult satire that this delightful book conceals."
1,Worst ever,"From the first dish we cooked, my husband and myself knew we did not like this cookware. Everything sticks like glue, even when using olive oil. Maybe the stainless steel would be better, these pans did not work for us at all."
2,Not what I had hoped,"Ordered as a housewarming gift for my best friend as they moved into a new house. I have two Calphalon skillets that are perfect, hence the gift. These dont work as well and I dont know why. I actually flew up and spent two days with them. Rice sticks, meat sticks, eggs stick. They are not happy and wont use the pans anymore. I am sorry that I bought this set"
5,Great cookware,I purchased this same cookware last year and have enjoyed cooking in it. I purchased this same cookware this year for my daughter to enjoy also.
4,Good Calphalon set,"I own a set of Calphalon One cookware; love it, but it's TERRIBLY expensive, and a rather small set. This set is second to Calphalon One. It's hard anodized, which I prefer hands down over the treated non-stick surface lines (even Calphalon's). I am a traditional cook, so I really use my cookware. It performs well, and cleans well.The handles are not as heavy as the C-One line, but they are fully metal so you can use them in the oven. The pans themselves are not quite as heavy gauge as C-One, but absolutely acceptable.The small 2 handled dutch oven will make one of the meanest port wine beef roasts you will ever have!For the cook who knows what she wants, the product description is helpful. Clearly identifying the product as hard anodized helped. Although I would have liked a comparison between the C-One line and this one, detailing the differences in gauge and handles, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
2,Not the American-made Calphalon,"This is the Calphalon made in China, so it is much thinner and lighter than the American-made Calphalon option. If you need a sturdy professional quality, this is not it. Having bought this set on sale, I broke up the set and made some presents for some young people just starting out and setting up a beginning kitchen and who were not developed cooks. It would not be worth full-price. I wish Amazon would label country of origin, especially on products made by a manufacturer that produces in more than one country and where the level of quality is dependent upon which country made the product."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"My girlfriend had picked up a very nice Calphalon cook pan at Ross for a great price and she really loves it. I thought I'd get her some more Calphalon cookware for Christmas and bought these pots. The very first time using two of these pots was a disaster. They don't come clean. The cookware film is coming off. One has a white film, the other has a black film. Absolutely do not buy this particular model. They are total crap."
2,Food Sticks,"I guess the quality is good, but everytime I make eggs, they stick to the pan. Not good."
3,Hated the dirty pan look,I love to cook and thought I'd love these pans ... I did not. They cooked ok but ran a little too hot with my gas range for my taste. But I'm returning them due to the 'dirty pan look'. After cooking bacon in the pan and washing it - it still looked dirty. I washed it again and same issue. I tried coating the pan first with oil and same thing happened. I'm not interested in having to scrub my pans with scouring powder after normal use. I'm going to try another type.
1,Cookware,"I am not happy with this product in the least. I have followed the directions every time for proper heating and yet everything I cook still sticks to the bottom. Also, I have not been able to clean the product to my satisfaction.I would not buy these pots/pans in the future."
1,unsatisfied...,"I expected this made by solid metal product as I bought the same brand last year. But this looks like a cheap ""MADE in CHINA"" model. Only one of the set seems to me ""made by solid thick metal"" others are very thin and the coting is not perpect. The pan goes sticky when heat comes a little bit high maybe a medium high. You have to use it at the least heat level if you do not want extra scrubbing for doing clean. I consider to return it that this is a totally unsatisfied product.."
2,Not a nonstick pan,"These pans require a LOT of butter or some type of oil when you cook if you plan on getting your food out of the pan! I do like the heavy quality of the pan, but that is about it."
1,Calphalon a disapointment,"I purchased this set in December for a gift. It was at a bargain price, but has turned out not to be a bargain. After only six months of use (the reputation of this maker is that it is of lasting quality), the pans are sticking to everything...and the recipient cannot figure out why.The Amazon replacement warranty has expired, and the manufacturer has thus far refused its return.My advise: buy a triple clad stainless set like the Chef Emerol sells ( i have his stuff and it is wonderful)."
3,Equal to Walmart pans,"I thought these pans were going to be different, but they are equal to any walmart pan... maybe a little heavier, but that is about it. I thought if I read up on how to use them, etc... that they would be like my Ultrex's that are discontinued, but they are just like normal cheap pans. And I follow the directions about usage, so don't think I didn't follow all the directions and hints on how to use them. I'm not impressed."
1,Worst cookware ever,My wife bought a calphalon pan from kitchen aide that was and still is amazing over a year ago. So I thought I would be nice and get her a full set for christmas. This set is the worst set of pans ever. Everything sticks to them. I just tried frying fish in a large pan and the batter stuck to the bottom so bad none of it stayed on the fish. I was so mad I went outside and through the pan in the trash. If your going to buy calphalon make sure to get the pans made by kitchen aide!
5,Great Product,BLUF: If you follow the instructions you will be pleased with the results.Pro: I love the fact that it does NOT have a non-stick coating that can come off in your food. They cook very well.Con: The only problem that I have is that the 3 quart pan's handels get very hot. The others do not have this problem.
1,Calphalon Hard Anodized - NO GO,"Worst pans I have ever used! Read everyone's review and advice on how to cook without sticking..no dice. Slow, low heat, everything..and I have been cooking a long time, and never a problem. Everything sticks to these pans, regardless, and does not release when cool.Back to cast iron. Poor investment, and I regret it every time I have to pull them out of the cupboard. No problem with a set of Cusinart pans I have."
1,Calphalon Has A Quality Control Problem,"What frustration! EVERYTHING sticks to these pans. I'm an accomplished cook, I own other Calphalon, and I'm here to tell you these pans are terrible. I have no doubt that others who rave about them got a great set of pans--like I thought I would get. There is obviously a QC problem here, and Calphalon's problem has become my problem.I'm returning the set, plus the Everyday pan and stockpot. It's great that Amazon has an easy return system (been shopping here for years and never used it until now), but it still means I have to repack everything, lug it to the UPS store, and ship it. I shop online to save time and money...and this experience has soured me on Calphalon. There are other anodized pans out there and I'm looking for a brand that offers CONSISTENT quality."
1,seems like a cheap knock off,"I purchased this set soon after purchasing two calphalon omelet pans at a housewares specialty store. These pans are NOTHING like the omelet pans I purchased. These pans are made in China, the omelet pans are made in Ohio. The handles on the omelet pans are polished these are rough. The omelet pans cook everything I have put in them perfectly and forgive a little too much heat. These pans stick, and spots can not be removed with a dobie and bon ami powder. I wish I had saved the box, so I could return them easily."
4,Excellent Product for The Price,To buy this product at such a cheap price was excellent. I'm not sure if it was last years range or something but at the price you pay i paid who cares. You walk into any high end cooking store and find these products for full price and you probably pay the same for one pot as you do for this set of 6.Although not dishwasher friendly they heat quickly and are extremely easy to clean.The ability to use then in the oven is also a big plus. Cannot fault this product.
1,No good!,"I didn't like this cookware set because every type of food stuck to it. I cook curries and fry things but everything stuck to the bottom of these pans, which made cleaning a nightmare. I had to return it and I completely love the new cusinart cookware."
1,Lousy product,"Food sticks to pans. this was made in China not the USA. Poor workmanship, if I had known before hand I never would have bought it for my sister. Very disappointed that Amazon would deal with this kind of product. I will be thinking a second time before I use Amazon again."
2,"Ease of use, storage and cleaning...forget it!","Very disappointed in these pans, though usable I'm sorry I insinerated the boxes cuz now its a hassle to send them back. Ultra special instructions for how to NOT get stuff to stick to them. Can't put them in the dishwasher. Can't wash them IMMEDIATELY after use. Have to let them cool down. I wouldn't recommend. Keep looking for something that you don't have to let your raw eggs warm to room temperature before putting them in the skillet (otherwise they will most definitely stick)."
1,Really STICKY cookware,"Do not buy! This is the worst cookware I've ever used, especially the saucepans. Should be advertised as STICKY cookware - whatever you cook will stick and will not come out even after overnight soaking and lots of scrubbing."
5,Calphalon Cookware,This cookware is well worth the money.I do not like teflon so this works well for our family.Some people do not know but teflon is very dangerous at high temps. Teflon is very toxic to parrots. If you have birds be very careful when buying cookware.
5,Top Notch,"Back when I was in school (and fire had just been discovered) I worked as a sous-chef and cooking has continued to be a hobby for me. I usually purchase cookware at restuarant supply places and get fairly inexpensive but serviceable stuff. I recentll splurged and got myself this Calphalon set. Wow. Great quality, wonderful performance, it's got it all. If you want professional-grade cookware and DO NOT want some crappy non-stick application, get this excellent set and see what a difference superior tools can make in your cooking."
4,Calphalon Commercial Cookware,My 9-piece set of cookware arrived containing only 8 pieces. The large roasting pan was missing. I contacted Amazon Cutomer Service and they immediately sent a replacement set ; return instructions and mailing label were sent via e-mail. The service was good.The cookware is performing well.
3,I'd buy something else,"I agree with the reviewers who complain about the sticking. If you are want non-stick, pass these by. I continue to favor my cast iron and a teflon coated Claphalon pan over these. The sizes of the sauce pans in this set seem odd and that also keeps me using them only occasionally. Yes, I have to soak before cleaning for almost anything that I cook in these pans which is not a big deal unless you consider that the tastiest bits of the dish aren't making it to your plate. Lastly, the ""Made in China"" is certainly a turn-off. Calphalon includes care and use instructions in the package that do not list this product line, leading me to believe that even Calphalon is not proud of these pans."
1,Very hard to cook with and even harder to clean,"I have had Calphalon cookware for years. I loved it! I wanted a new set and gave my old set to my son. This cookware is the WORST to clean! It was easier to clean my stainless steel as I can at least use a scubber pad. It says to use baking soda on their problem solving. I do, but I go through baking soda like crazy. Also, it is difficult to cook with because everything sticks even with the use of oil or butter. I read reviews and am very surprised it has as high of a rating as it does. I would strongly recommend a different set."
1,just awful,"Why would anyone want pots that can't be used on high heat, can't be washed in the dishwasher or can't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish. My Calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly.I am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental. After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp. Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads. After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food. I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish. I had taken some comfort in the ""lifetime"" warrantee, I tried to return them, but the warrantee, like this cookware is absolutely useless!"
2,seconds?,this nine piece set of calophon cookware must be reject sets. we have had calophon before and expected the same quality product. this new set is Junk!
1,OK pans,"Thought I was getting these awesome pots and pans, but in actuality, they look nice, but they are a pain to keep clean. And the instructions say not to use PAM, so there's no point in trying to cook low fat in these pans. Even when I use oil, things things still stick. Also, you are not supposed to stack them when you store away, so I have to buy a new pot rack, which there is not really any room in my kitchen for. I'm so disappointed with my purchase. I wish I could return them. If I could do it all over again, I would spend the extra money for the non-stick calphalon."
1,Calphalon Warranty is Bogus - Buyer Beware,"I received a set of Calphalon pots several years ago. The outside surface scratches easily and requires a special cleaner. The pots also got worn away by repeated washings and are not dishwasher safe. Though the company claims to have a 10-year warranty, when I returned the pots due to my dissatisfaction, they didn't provide a store credit or a replacement set. In fact, Calphalon just sent them back to me. Even manager Tony didn't come through. I strongly recommend against this company and their products - their customer service was atrocious and their product is too difficult to maintain for everyday people's use."
4,cookware,i recieved the cookware sooner than expected and have enjoyed using the calphalon cookware. would by this as a gift or recommend to a friend
4,calphalon commercial,"These are great pans. They cook evenly, but require some elbow grease to clean.The only thing I don't like about them is the skinny handles. They are not comfortable in my hands."
3,"Not great, not horrible.","I'd say they're pretty much worth what you're paying. They do heat up really slow so that takes some adjustment but the pans work well and are okay. They just seem to have a bit of discoloration to the bottoms on the inside of some of them. Otherwise, the lids are flimsy and thin.Not bad. I'm happy."
5,Very Good Quality Product,This was a very good quality product and well made. Good set with good sizes of pans and skillets.
4,good sturdy set,"this is a good set, but you really need to learn to cook on them, at first everything stuck! we were so used to non-stick pans. Now they work great and clean up nicely."
1,everything sticks,I bought these because I thought it was time I invested in some nice pans. For some reason these pans are the worst things I have ever cooked in. Every thing I make sticks to the pans. I can't make eggs without them sticking to the pans. I can't make anything!
5,A Steal,"I rarely review but after receiving my cookware I felt I must. Got this cooking set for next to nothing of the retail value. I finally got a chance to use it tonight. Wow! The cookware is elegant and very functional. Clean-up was a real breeze. My favorite feature is the lifetime warranty, judging by the quality of the first cook I doubt I will ever need it. This is a must have for any kitchen on a budget."
5,great pots,"Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized 9-Piece SetThis set is great. I bought my second set, because I cook alot and need extra pots. No complaints here."
1,"Beware, not all Calphalon Hard-Anodized Cookware is the same!!!","My wife loved her new Calphalon pans that she bought, so when I saw this deal on Amazon, I pounced on it, thinking it was a great value. When the pans arrived, they looked the same, but after a couple of weeks of use, we noticed that there was something different. For one, the new pan felt lighter in our hands than the original my wife bought. Second, After a few washings, the anodized surface looked different between the two pans. It was only after helping my wife wash and dry after dinner one night that I noticed the reason we felt the way we did. The original pan my wife bought in a retail store was made in the USA (Ohio), while the pan that didnt seem ""quite right"" was made in China. I dont remember the ad mentioning this and I felt misled. If you are a Calphalon fan, make sure you know the country of manufacture before you buy!!!!!"
1,Don't Buy These Pans! Buyer Beware,"I read many of the product reviews and also own other Calphalon pans, these don't measure up and everything, and I mean everything, sticks to these pans.I have other Calphalon pans, all with smooth handles, these have cast iron handles and are a cheap knock-off of the originals. Save yourself the frustration and don't buy these pans!I purchased them for Christmas and I am calling Amazon tomorrow to return."
2,"Factory 2nds, or maybe 3rds?","Compared to other pieces from Calphalon hard-anodized line, this set is much lesser quality. The handles are not as smooth as the other pieces I own and purchased separately. I don't claim to be a gourmet cook, but I've been cooking long enough to know the quality of things I paid for. The set quickly became dull and has discoloration on the bottom like I had it for years (it's only been a month). And I did follow care instructions and never put it in dishwasher. Not to mention that I got 8 pc. instead of 9 being advertised. Very disappointed and would not recommend."
4,Excellent Value,"Had these a little over a month, and am very pleased with the quality for the price."
4,Great value!!,"I'm quite happy with my new cookware set. Although it took several tries to get used to cooking with it, I am proud to say that my cooking has improved immensely with my new calphalon set. The directions included with the cookware are specific and if followed, you will find yourself very satisfied with the result. Food still sticks to the pan but it's very easy to clean as stated in the directions. Great value!"
1,This is a terrible set!,"Don't buy it - this is a terrible set! Amazon being a reputable seller should remove it from the site.I read very mixed reviews before buying this set but still decided to go ahead because I owned another piece of Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware. The pan that I had was also made in China and worked great for me - so I didn't mind the origin. Probably at least a half of the things we have in a typical household have been produced in China anyways.So this is not about the country of origin - this is about the quality of the product. Everything people say here about food sticking to the pan is completely true! Cleaning these pans is almost impossible! No, I didn't expect them to behave like non-sticks do but I didn't expect everything to stick regardless of the amount of butter/oil I put.I'm returning this set and will continue my search for a good set of cookware."
2,MADE IN CHINA!,"THREE WORDS.....made in china! Not a bad set for the price but if you're expecting the great quality from Calphalon like we were, spring the extra money and buy the set with the name brand etched in the handles....MADE IN USA"
3,Good cookset,I purchased this for my daughter-in-law. I saved quite a bit off the retail price and she loves it. Fast shipping too!
2,5 Stars?!? Maybe if it was free. Honest review here. No Fluff...,"I would tell anyone to STAY AWAY. I have heard so much about Calphalon being the best nonstick pans and such. So I shelled out almost 400$ at Boston Store for the set, since I love to cook. I have had them now for 2 months. Everyday I cook with them EVERYTHING sticks. It doesnt matter if I use a table spoon of cooking oil or a cup. My food never turns out right and it sticks and chars. Honestly, I bought a Tephlon pan from Goodwill for 79c and it NEVER sticks and was a far better buy then the Calphalon. This was a bad 400$ investment."
3,non-stick? no~,it's stick!!and it's much more heavier than my expectation!the price is lovely~ but the low price has the reason!
1,Waste of money - total junk,"Selling this set should be considered fraud. Everything sticks to these pots and pans. I know that they are not supposed to be non-stick but food sticks to these pots and pans like glue, even when just warming soup or frying an egg with properly heated oil, butter or non-stick spray. You have to scrub with a brillo pad to get the stuck food off these things. I got so frustrated that I junked the whole set and didn't even bother to get a refund. I just didn't even want to see this junk."
1,Everything sticks to these pans,"I purchased these pans in 2009. I read the instructions that came with them before I ever used them. I have always followed manufacturers' instructions and 90% of everything I cook sticks to these pans and they are VERY difficult to scrub clean afterwards. I've never used a cooking spray on them, per instructions, always oil or butter, but it doesn't matter. Don't purchase them unless you really enjoy standing at your sink scrubbing and scrubbing. I was very disappointed and will not purchase this brand again."
4,I just received my set as a gift and I love it.,I just received my set as a gift and I love it. I have a large family and many of the pots are very large and I can cook for all of my family at once with no problems now.The food sticks a bit and Machine washing is not recommended. Those are the only problems with the set.
2,Doesn't last long,"Cookware does okay when new but finish does not last. Even if you do everything perfect, finish will ""come off"" in a couple of years and food will then stick. Not bad for cheap cookware but don't expect to keep it for over 5 years or so. Calphalon does not answer complaints or reports about warranty at all. Best buy for cookware is the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Stainless."
5,The Old Bank House,Angela Thirkell writes cozy stories. I know that I shall return to reading the Barsetshire series again and again. The Old Bank House is just one more lovely installment in this series. I strongly recommend this book.
1,Junk,I have been using a router for many years. I put this on a Porter Cable 690 and it vibrated terribly. I read the instructions and tried everything they suggested to remove the vibration but it didn't help. I guess the fact that they send instructions on how to attempt to remove the vibration should be a flag for anyone. I wasted my money.
3,Good...but a flaw,"I've had this for quite a while and it does make bit changes very, very quick and easy. However I have noticed when I tighten down the set screw, that it puts little knicks or dents in my router bit. I don't know if it really affects my router, but after paying so much for router bits, I don't think this chuck should ding them up."
5,Cats rule the web,This book is on eof the funniest books i have ever read.I was rolling on the floor with the parodys the authors write about. Go get the book it will provide you with days of fun.nick
2,Definitely not happy,This wok is useless on electric cook tops because of the small flat bottom. I would imagine it might work better with gas stoves though.
3,Seemed like good quality.....but my dog is smarter than the trout!,"When the product arrived (for a Christmas present), it seemed very strong and made of good quality material---but when my Golden gets a new toy, she will play with it for the whole night and it never leaves her side. She ended up chewing and pulling at the fins of the trout and formed small holes on the first day. It is now January 5th and we had to take it away from her because she pulled the first bit of stuffing out from it last night. I think if the trout had no fins, it wouldn't have been a problem and there would be nothing distracting for her to yank at or chew on. I gave 3 stars since it did provide a couple weeks of fun at least."
5,THIS TOY IS INCREDIBLE!!,"This is the ONLY toy that my American bulldog, Libby, hasn't destroyed. Every other toy we have given her has been destroyed in--at most--2 hours! With her ""fishie,"" Libby plays tug and catch--and it holds up. She even sleeps with it! Each one lasts about 6 months--then we replace it with another. She looks adorable strutting around with Fishie in her mouth!!I would recommend this product HIGHLY for any dog with large jaws who is a voracious chewer. FISHIE RULES!!"
1,This is not static cling,This is actually black magic just simple tint. It is not anything the description says so don't buy it if you think its going to be the static cling removable tint!EDIT: DO NOT USE THIS! 1 year later and the 2 squares that I left on my window have completely turned purple. Looks like absolute crap.
3,Its OK,"If youre buying this type of tint instead of getting professional car window tint, DONT do it. There is virtually NO way of applying this tint to car windows without getting bubbles. It DOES NOT look good on cars. However, when I was working nights and sleeping during the day, this tint was great on my bedroom windows.In my opinion:Use on car- Bad, 2 starsUse on bedroom window- Great 4-5 stars"
5,brisling sardines,I eat sardines at least three times a week and these are some of the best I have ever had!
2,Not the same as last year,"I purchased several boxes of this product last year. They were from Norway and excellent. Perfectly smoked and texture was just right. This time the label said ""prodcut of Poland"" so not sure if I ordered the wrong item or if it was substituted; but these were definitely not the same quality. Sardines were muushy and had a metallic taste to them."
4,Still a Masterpiece,"This is my least favorite of Butler's work just because telepathy isn't one of my favorite themes, but the book is stil a masterpiece and I would highly recommend it."
3,A must buy to continue the series,"Unlike some other reviewers, I wasn't too disappointed as to teh lack of a centrally dominant female character (Though this does seem to be unlike Butler's trend). Though the book is slow and moves you around as quickly as a TV movie of the week, its worth reading to see how the Patternists style of life transforms the world within which they live."
2,"Not the best, but the rest is soooo good!","I read _Patternmaster_ fifth (at least) of all the Butler I've read. All of the others are better, by far. One of the difficulites in this book, I believe, is that the protagonists are telepaths. These telepaths have little humanity left in them, there are no outsiders to comment on their arrogance. I don't recommend it, except that the rest of the series is *amazing.* And it's crazy to love a series and not read it all."
3,skips too much time,"Ah, what happens after the pattern is established, huh? Suddenly in a ""series"" where women played powerful and important roles we have a story where women are almost non-existent -- disappointing. The characters and plot are strong as they are in the vast majority of Butler's work but if you want strong female characters, you'll have to look elsewhere."
4,Harsh world of political intrigue,"I liked the writing and the harshness of the setting. The plot was totally environment based so fairly original, but there just didn't seem to be enough of it. It could have used about 100 more pages and a couple sub-plots. This is actually the last book in _The Patternist_ series but her first published novel."
3,Downtown...,I bought this album for one song in particular which was Downtown. It is such an awesome and catchy song. I have been humming it ever since I saw the movie. Other good songs include The Weight and Angel Of The Morning. A shame however is that there aren't more songs than 10....
5,Name this song,Im trying to find the song that is playing in the scene where Brittany Murphy hangs herself. Is it Patsy Cline? Is it even on the soundtrack??
3,Angel of the Morning and Wilco,"Interesting that Angelina Jolie's uncle (Chip Taylor) wrote 'Angel of the Morning' ,and that Winona's mentioned in the past that Wilco was her favorite band..."
4,"""Girl, Interrupted"" ST is very good","The composer's eighteen or so tracks are great. If you've ever seen the movie, you know they fit perfectly with the scenes as well as the characters, especially number 15 (Lisa), which was modeled after the amazing Angelina Jolie's character. The songs ""The Weight"" by The Band and ""How To Fight Lonliness"" by Wilco sound as good on the CD as they did in the movie. Everything is just really appropriate, and the choice of music goes well with the film. This is one of my favorite movie soundtracks, besides all three Hackers, Foxfire, Center Stage, and Brokedown Palace! Even if you haven't seen the movie, get the CD. It's great."
5,Awesome!,"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Both the lyrical songs and instrumental music are great. I listen to this CD all the time!"
5,"Girl, Interrupted",This is an awesome soundtrack it is enjoyable and fun to listen to. the best songs on this Soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
5,Soundtrack of my Life,"All of these songs are wonderful! I love ""Angel of the Morning"" and ""The Weight"" and the rest. Whenever I listen to these songs, I feel like I am hearing about my own life. The original score by Mychael Danna is magnificent as well. The Glass Orchestra adds such a delightful touch to his music and it perfectly projects how us crazy people think. A great buy for anybody."
4,Good Disc,"Girl, Interrupted is a great movie, and this soundtrack is a wonderful addition to my collection. The first half of the disk contains the popular songs that were used within the movie, and the second half -- the better half in my opinion -- contains instrumental music by Mychael Danna. Listening reminded me how powerful the music was to the picture, and how powerful the story was."
3,"Clear to Understand, But Not Catagorized","The tapes are clear to understand and it is easy to repeat back the Polish words, but there is no organization to the tapes. Instead of grouping like catagories together (months, body parts, verbs of motion etc.) they are spead out throughout the tape. For example, they will say a month then the next word will be an unrelated word like table, then 10 minutes later the tape will tell you another month of the year. I think it would be much easier to memorize the words if they were catagorized throughout the tape."
4,"Good concept, flawed implementation, good price.","The concept is good: present vocabulary words on tape so that you can listen and learn new words.The first problem is that the English is before the Polish for half the words, and the order is reversed for the other half. This is confusing. It should pick one order and stick to it.The price makes it worth buying in spite of its flaws."
4,Good for Chocolate fix,"Hard to find in the stores, glad it was available at Amazon .com ; this hard candy is good for a no cal chocolate fix. Been using this candy since it was introduced and it is not as sweet as the Strawberry and Creame."
4,delicious but dont eat too many!,"These sugar free candies are every bit as tasty as ones that contain sugar, and the flavors are intense (also true of strawberry and creme). They satisfy that urge for something sweet without the calories. However, I found that if I have more an one or two of these, I get quite ummm, gassy. And if I truly overindulge, it has for me the laxative effect of most sugar free candies, as well as uncomfortable bloating. So, enjoy these candies, I would give 5 stars for taste, but be careful until you learn what your tolerance level is."
5,Love all his books!,"Hands down, the best hiking book(s) I've ever used! Now that I live in CA, I wish William L. Sullivan would come down here and write a hiking book for the Bay Area. Nobody in CA comes close to writing at his level. He does an excellent job not only describing the trails (which are not always well-marked or obvious), but he also includes a little educational component as well. Whenever I travel back to OR, I always make sure I have the latest copy of his book, depending on which region of the state I'm going to. Love his books!"
4,A Thorough Guide for Hikers,"We bought the book as a resource for our vacation rental on the coast and I'm most impressed with (1) its thoroughness and (2)its accessible approach. There are hikes - and even strolls - at almost every level and the hand-drawn maps are easy to follow. I see it as a very valuable resource for people at all exercise levels visiting the Oregon coast, even for fairly regular visitors."
3,Propaganda...,This was pretty one sided. I would not take everything you see here as good info. Consider there was not one interview with a person working for the big farm and many have been hired for that...
5,Awesome Dragon!!!!!!!!!!,I collect dragons and got this one for my birthday. It's one of my best dragons. It's a great dragon for anyone 10 and older because the castle is a little hard to put together. But once you get it together it stays together pretty good. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes dragons!!!
2,1848,"Wisconsin became the 30th U.S state in 1848. Today the population is about 5 million, with predominantly German ancestry."
5,Four Stories,Not really a review. This book includes The Touch; Cries and Whispers; The Hour of the Wolf; The Passion of Anna. That's all I wanted to say.
2,Not so Universal,This is only universal for Rubbermaid coolers with a bracket already attached.If there is no bracket attached it is completely non-universal!
4,Much better than I expected,"this book surprised me-it was very good! There was plenty of action and intrigue, in an interesting and believable SF environment. The only thing I didn't like about it was the lack of maps and a glossary"
5,"This is an amazing series, and a great book.","This entire series was phenominal. The characters are amazingly well written, and the multiple plots are well woven together. The facts laid out in the futuristic world are all realistic, and I can imagine some of the devices and ways of life that Zahn portrays.The whole ""elderdeath"" twist is ingenious. The concept of ""elders"", ""CIRCE"", and ""The Copperheads"" was really interesting and added great depth to this story. I rate this book a 10.Ronnie"
4,Very Entertaining,"With the first book of the Conqueror's trilogy, Zahn sets the mood for a gripping and exciting saga. When a fleet of human ships encounters a previously unknown species, they transmit a standard 'first contact' communication package. The aliens instantly open fire and destroy the entire task force in six minutes. As the human government moves towards war the saga focuses on the Cavanaugh family and thier involvement in the war. Zahn's development of specific technologies was facinating and unique. It is rare to find anyone in the SF field who can truely come up with anything new. If you are a SF fan I highly recommend that you read this book."
1,Boring!!!!!!!,"Jeez, this book moved so slow that I actually fell asleep while reading it. I've generally liked Zahn's books before, but this one was simply not one of them. I shudder to think what the rest of the series is like."
1,Not good...,"The mesh cover arrived with a snap missing. Very disappointing. The most annoying thing is the seller, Baby Bungalow, would not exchange it and just gave me the customer service number for Phil & Teds. Why couldn't they just exchange it for new one, as if I had bought it in their store. Not cool. Will never buy from them again!!!!!!"
1,i agree with the 7 year old,"I agree with the 7-year old. It makes me feel bad for the members of Joe Public, because they will forever be haunted by the fact that they created this noise. Popular culture is disgusting when a band like this can get a record deal. I have to stop writing now because I fear that the Live and Learn song will get stuck in my head again.Dave Matthews Band Rules!!!"
1,Disgusting,"I hate Joe Public. They are the worst band in the history of the world. I first encountered their horrendous ""music"" in the acclaimed film ""NBA Jams: The Music Videos"", which featured one of their two songs, ""Live and Learn."" If one plays the song in reverse, one can hear subliminal messages supporting the idea of eating small children."
5,Great Book for Kids,I think this book is an excellent book for kids who are just learning to read. The story is fun and easy to understand for beginner readers. I would recommend this book to first and second grade students.
3,not enough,"Cups are too flimsy...crumple too easily...not good for use with children, who were my intended target population out by our pool."
4,Dog loves it but stuffing doesn't last long.,"Our dog, a 20# Boston Terrier, LOVES the crinkle fish (as we call it). She attacks the squeaker immediately, and honestly, the stuffing only lasts about 15 minutes...she tears a hole in the lining and we have to pull all the innards out. That said, even when defluffed and desqueakered, she still loves the toy and will play with it forever and a day (it still has the crinkle sound). The thing is so bedraggled and pathetic looking, but she still keeps coming back to it."
5,backup alarm,This should be standard equipment on every car. Bulb is considerably brighter than standard bulb and the warning alarm is a safety must.
3,Not for Cold Weather,"I'm from Texas, where these work good. I travel to Michigan several times a year. When there in the winter time, these lights don't last but a couple of days in extreme cold. So, it's kind of a toss up. Good in warm, not in cold..."
2,Beeping bulb,"Came in on time, but didn't fit and they refuse to return my money or even take a few minutes to look for a solution."
4,alert beeper,I like it . Put it on my pick up truck . Works great when backing up . It get your atten.
3,Good start,"Disclosure: The second-hand seller misrepresented the condition of this set - as such, we were missing four books and the stickers/chart. The items that we actually did receive held my little guy's attention and he loved the stories. I'm sure he would have liked the stickers/progress chart that normally comes with this too.Would like to see more physical activities related to the reading portion (cut-out letters to spell own words, etc).Seemed well-put together. Just gun-shy about purchasing second-hand again."
5,Love It!!,I purchased this item for my 5 year old in kindergarten. We absolutely love the concept and the books are great! However it is a little too easy for him...so either we're doing really well or we could have purchased the next grade up.
5,This is the best product ever.,"I bought this Hooked on Phonics Kindergarten for my 4 year old daughter. Before I bought this, I showed her the demo of this product from their website and she wanted to get it. Once she got it, she immediately started to play CD-ROM game and she didn't want to stop. Next day she started the yellow workbook with audio CD and start reading books. Because first few books start with simple few words, she could read them easily and it made her confident at reading. She completed whole thing in 2 weeks. She love to read to me at bedtime and it became our routine, she reads 2 books to me and I read 2 books to her before bed. Since she wanted to go next level, I got her 1st grade one and she is working on it."
4,LOVE & HATE IT...,"We bought this about 4 weeks ago. Unfortunately, we did not realize that this is supposed to be for a MAC running in classic (ATTN HOOKED ON PHONICS SOFTWARE TEAM...NO MACS RUN CLASSIC SINCE 2004!...SUPPORT THE NEW SYSTEMS). Somehow our Mac Mini running 10.5.1 is able to run the program about 1 out of every 15 times that we launch it.3 year old boy...he absolutely LOVES the program. It captivates him for over an hours every time and he begs us to let him use it.4 1/2 year old boy...he is absolutely BORED with this. We read to him every night some advanced books for a boy his age so he knows his letters very well.Overall, we would recommend it to anyone (without a MAC) who has a 3 year old. It is a lot of fun."
2,Not the best!,This program in my opinion is backward. It starts kids reading the endings of words first then adding the first letter. It did not work with my kids. My son hated reading because of it. We have gone to Sing Spell read and Write with the best Joy and success.
3,Mac Users Beware,"My daughter was so excited to receive this program for Christmas. The reader books and flashcards seem useful, but we are all disappointed to learn the CD Rom portion of this program ONLY runs on Mac OS 9 or below, which has pretty much been obsolete for years. HoP's customer service department was less than helpful, and I'm sending the program back."
2,Older edition,"There are a few different Hooked on Phonics for each level of learning. I love hooked on phonics for my son, but made a mistake buying this package. This is the 2007 edition. Pass on this and get the 2009 edition (Amazon link below). The 2009 offers better videos and materials. This contains audio CDs, and the included DVD is merely the same song over and over for each letter of the alphabet. The newer edition has a totally new animation set and includes sound blending and word formation videos.Learn to Read Kindergarten Complete - Amazon Exclusive Edition"
3,starting point,hooked on phonics is a great beginners point if you have know idea where to start. It is very repetitive. I thought it was going to be more innovative. Had I known I would not have purchased it. It's simply repeating the ABC over and over again. not what I expected.
3,Taggies musical duck,"This is my sons much loved favourite cuddly toy. He goes to sleep every night listening to the music and loves rubbing the tags between his fingers. The only downside of this toy is that you can only surface wash it. It cannot be machine washed because the musical component is not able to be removed without cutting it open. I have recently done this, cut a seam, removed musical part, machined washed, dried it on the clothes line then put it back together and sewed up the seam. It came up great."
2,Schrade isn't really an old timer.,"Decent knife, but not the same quality that I have come to expect from one that bears the Old Timer name. I don't care for the handles, they aren't the same as the Deltrin that are advertised."
3,cutting edge,average item - heavier than expected but pleased ...arrived on time and has been used often so it holds up well to daily needs
5,A nice way to begin Raymond Chandler addiction,"If you don't already have a bookshelf full of Raymond Chandler, Ross McDonald and other excellent mystery writers of those times this is a fine start, three good, solid novels to take up the shelf space of only one. I'd easily give every Raymond Chandler novel he ever penned 5 stars and these are no exception. You won't go wrong reading Chandler mysteries and you won't go wrong with this compact edition of three great books in one."
4,deliciously moody,"I really enjoyed this collection of novels. And, I think, interestingly, these stories suggest that Chandler was homosexually curious. Note, for instance, how often he talks of a particular man being beautiful, and describes in detail the given man's physical attributes. This awareness only slightly altered my image of Philip Marlowe having a Humphrey Bogart voice and manner. I think a new Philip Marlowe movie that captures this dimension would be fascinating -- the tension between being straight (and macho) and yet having this undercurrent."
4,Not for beginners,"This is a good book if you know a little C but would like to expand on that. It contains lots of examples, questions, section reviews. Unfortunately, it does not talk about Windows programming. There is only a small introduction at the end of the book. Another weak point is that there is no chapter on graphics and sound"
2,Limited compliers.,If you are trying to teach yourself C using the standard complier that comes with most Linux versions try another book. A great deal of the code in this book will not compile with the gcc complier. Save yourself some frustration and find another book.
3,No good for outdoor night pictures...,"The G400 makes for great daytime pictures, it's compact, speedy power up and the menus are pretty easy to figure out (i thought the canon s400 was a lot more difficult to navigate). It also has a continous shutter mode where you can take shots in quick succession for sport events.The main complaint I have is that night pictures of the outdoors are extremely blurred (you need a tripod to stabilize the camera otherwise the pictures are useless) and often don't have sufficient brightness in the images. I was also disappointed that the software has no support for stiching images together to create a panoramic photograph."
3,"Great features, photos, poor longevity","In agreement with other reviews. This camera has great features -- too many to even list. It has aperture priority and speed priority, color, b&w;, sepia etc. Takes crisp, clear true-color pictures. Quality is great.However, the lens mechanism has frozen in the open position after about owning it for one year. You can get it to close if you pull the battery out and turn it back on - but you have to close the cover very quickly to keep in in - it then registers an error and shuts off.Too bad -- $325 is more than I wanted to pay for one year - didn't think I'd need to upgrade so soon and don't want to spend another $100 - $140 to repair it. Haven't contacted Minolta yet, but don't want to throw good money after bad...."
2,Manufacturing Defect,"Bought this camera after reading many reviews and doing a lot of research. My camera had a pixel problem, after viewing pictures on computer and printing, there was a bright white/purplish speckle in the same spot in every photo.Could not return to Newegg (they would not accept an exchange even though it says right here they would exchange for exact item only!), had to contact manufacturer. Surprisingly they were helpful and I have to ship the camera away for repairs. I will update on how long it takes as this could make or break my opinion of Konica Minolta.The camera, aside from that problem, is really nice and worked well. I was shocked at how small it was and how fast it worked. I wish there was no ""speckle"" in my photos... I would have praised this camera everywhere."
2,"Sun, moon, and california---all spell doom","I bought this book because it's beautiful and I'm interested in housing design, and now I find it to be a propaganda (although still beautiful I'll admit just to be fair). The author is too much of a lefty dreamer to realize what real development (and life) is like. Like so many on that coast, he imagines living in houses that simply use electricity and warmth from the sun, that are designed to make use of nature, and that create perfect little communities. It all sounds like a far-fetched fantasy to me. In the townhouse I live in (which I just bought three months ago and love), I can not imagine how all these schemes would be accomplished. Homeowner's associations, government regulation, or something equally nefarious seem likely?Buy this book you want to listen to dreams about a future where we are all turned into renters in a European type town."
5,"WOODY'S BACK WITH REALLY SMART, INSIGHTFUL LAUGHS","I've only seen this fine movie four or five times, sharing it with friends, crying 'hey, you gotta see this'. But from this limited viewing I think that WA's trademark brilliant, neurotic humor is back. If you liked the late-earlier Allen films, from Annie Hall to Deconstructing HarryDeconstructing Harry,Annie Hall, you're going love this return to intelligent humor from the master. If you IQ's over room temperature, grab this movie, you'll thank me."
2,Woody Not Your Best,First I am a huge Woody Allen Fan. I own at least a dozen of his movies. Mostly the older ones. I am a huge Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton fan as well. So these are the ones I enjoy the most. This movie was cute at best. Woody quit trying to find people to play your part. I like Larry David but this seemed forced. Also as a Christian I was offended by your repeated attack on Christians. Surely you can be funny without repeatedly making fun of something that you know nothing about.For that reason alone I would not recommend this movie to my friends. Of course most of them think I am strange for even watching your movies. But you can been funnny and have good dialogue when you try.
2,Big bore,"Not at all what I would expect from two of my favorite cineastes, Allen and David. I actually fell asleep."
3,Didn't work for me,As a fan of both Woody Allen and Larry David I was disappointed in this film. The premise is too unbelievable right from the start and I had a hard time empathizing with any of the characters. There are more laughs in a single episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm than in this entire film.
4,If you like Larry David!,"If you like or love Curb your enthusiasm-Larry David-Sienfeld, You should like this movie! It's very Larry David. And it's a really nice story and funny and the characters are so likeable! Definately two thumbs up from me."
2,"Lame, lame, lame.","I've watched many Woody Allen flicks, and have enjoyed most of them, especially when he gets away from comedy (after a while, they all seem like the same movie, however). But this movie was utter disappointment - a day after viewing it, I forgot what it was about, and could not recall a single worthwhile scene. Don't waste your money."
2,Flat out LAM,"This was my first Woody Allen film and I was not impressed. I have heard that his films are typically funny, solid thought provoking films. This is film was flat out LAME."
1,Both Woody Allen & Larry David fail,"Why is Larry David playing Woody Allen? Why didn't Woody play himself. Although smartly written, this is very hard to watch. I blame Woody for attempting to have Larry David do this lame impersonation. I cringed the entire movie. It could have been great but ended unbelieveable and total junk. No wonder this crapped out at the theaters."
3,Mildly Entertaining.,"I'm a bigger Larry David fan than a Woody Allen fan. In Whatever Works, Larry David's character is the same guy out of Curb your Enthusiasm with a different name. I fear Larry David is so used to playing himself that he can't be taken for anything else in such kind of roles and even if you do take him to be the character he was trying to play, there isn't much fun in it. This film is an average comedy, I thought I'll love it despite what everyone else says. Is it a must watch? Not at all."
2,Larry is not enough,"I'm a huge Larry David fan, but this movie did not live up to my expectations. I really did not laugh all that much. Woody Allen usually writes a good story and this one must be the exception. Pass on this one, guys and girls."
2,Whatever Works,One of those Woody Allen films that reminds me I have to be careful about what he puts out. Should have rented it. But a bit funny.
2,what a miss,I love Larry and Woody but I can barely watch this movie. It rehashes old Woody themes with Larry David just playing Woody. These guys are too talented to put this out.
2,"You've seen this before, and better.","""Whatever Works"" is so flat and unpersuasive that it caused me to question my love for Woody Allen's best films. Is he really so one-dimensional, returning time and time again, with diminishing returns, to the themes that have filled too many of his films? Forget for a moment the older man/younger woman relationships - how about the persistent hatred of popular music, the affairs without any emotional consequences, the Manhattan that resembles no Manhattan I've inhabited in the last 40 years?The problem is that this film, like so many of his films these days, is positively hermetically sealed off from any new experience, any new opinions, any new take on life. You would hope that his recent series of films made overseas would result in a fresh perspective once Woody Allen returned to NYC, but no. I wish I liked the film more, but it's getting harder and harder for me to warm to anything Allen is creating."
2,Har dee harr har,"We, duh Audience, are supposed to believe a gal that looks like EVAN RACHEL WOOD is going to go for a guy that looks like the 3 Stooges' Larry Fine's GRANDFATHER?!?Woody Allen really unleashes his contempt for, heck, darn near anyone that doesn't live in New York City. A married couple of Middle American bumpkins visits NYC and before you know it, one comes out of the closet and the other embraces a ""bohemian"" relationship with TWO men (in the same bed)! Golly, is that all it takes?I think we, duh Audience, are supposed to see Larry David's character as a crusty but loveable misanthrope, but actually, he's a tool, a mean, self-absorbed tool.There ARE several genuinely funny moments in ""WW,"" but not enough of them.Buy or rent ""Love & Death"" or ""Take the Money & Run"" for Allen films from when he was laff-out-loud FUNNY and not loaded with contempt for his non-NYC audience."
2,Silly and contrived,"This felt like watching a filmed summer stock play, with contrived and sometimes stilted dialog. There was absolutely no convincing reason that the young woman would suddenly fall in love with this unattractive, curmudgeonly old man. And on and on with unconvincing characters and dialog. There were a handful of chuckles, but if I were less kind, I would have called the movie ""stupid"" rather than ""silly."" Woody Allen has added another clunker to his very uneven output."
5,Classic Woody-GREAT FILM,"This movie is classic Woody Allen material unlike other recent films such as Scoop, Matchpoint, Anything Else, etc. (Matchpoint was great by the way). I believe Woody wrote Whatever Works many many years ago (70's or 80's) and it is certainly reflected in the attitude of this movie. Larry David is beyond brilliant effing perfection. I can't believe Woody has not used him before. This movie is one of my favorites, it is believable in its entirety especially in New York. The characters are well developed and executed and it just feels like a Woody Allen movie.Its a complete bonus for me that there are a lot of shots in Chinatown, in particular down Division Street area under the Manhattan Bridge. I just love that area and its completely under used in film.Woody made me very very happy with this one! I own it and watch it often when I feel crappy and need something great. A favorite line ""Thats an awfully aggressive ensemble, are you looking to end up in an abortion clinic""."
5,Keeps me mostly dry,"The fender clamps easily to the seatpost and is adjustable in angle and length. The angle is adjustable with a thumbscrew. The fender is actually two pieces with the length (I have it extended to its full length) being set by two screws. In wet conditions I simply attach the fender with the thumbscrew. In dry conditions I take the fender off, but leave the clamp to which it attaches to the seatpost in place. The fender keeps most of the water and road crud off my back."
1,Too much culture not enough language.,"I had the AUTHOR of the book as my teacher for college Spanish 4. There was way too much culture in the course and the book, and not enough learning about the advanced language. I hated this book, but I love learning Spanish. I found it difficult because Spanish is not my native language."
3,Tatiana's Jingle Bells makes worth buying this release,"There are many good artists featured, and even though some of them are my idols (ie. Myriam Hernandez) I have to admit that the songs they performed were not well suited for their voices and singing style. But Tatiana's brilliant rendition of ""Jingle Bells"" in Spanish: ""Campanas Navidenas"" saves this collection. Tatiana's voice suits perfectly the Christmas classic done in a 80's electro-pop style. The track is definately 5-stars. As an overall collection I would rate it with 3 stars.The edition shown on this page is a re-issue of the original 1986 release. But it's hard to tell if it's a new remaster. The album first appeared on CD in 1991 (in the US, as far as I know)."
2,Dwelling In the Out House,"Never judge a CD by the cover. Just because the artwork is appealing and the songs hover between the 5-7 minute mark, doesn't mean this is going to be a great listen. I found this album on the whole to be quite meaningless. I'm sure the guys in this band poured their hearts and souls into this, but it doesn't show in the results. If this band is supposed to be progressive metal, be progressive. Don't dwell on the watered-down Dream Theater sound. The songs are all very ""safe"" sounding, kind of like a progressive metal placebo. If this band is supposed to be progressive, it must be on an extremely superficial level. They certainly aren't breaking any new musical ground. The most surprising thing about this CD is that it wasn't released on the Magna Carta Label. It would fit in with their roster of fourth rate Dream Theater clones. This CD will be dwelling in my dustbin."
5,cone cups,"The cups are great, hard to find In Nashville. Some leak from time to time but overall a great product."
5,Very Pretty Ring,"I bought this for myself, my 13yr old daughter loves it. She's also worn it a few times. It if a very pretty ring and comes in a sweet little box, great for gift giving."
5,"not to big, not to small","I got this as a gift for my friend who rides her bike all over. She really liked it, becuase it was informative and it is on the smaller size. So she can actually take it with her in her pack when she goes riding."
3,Dated,"Information is somewhat dated. The style of the book is a bit old fashion with maps the lack detail. Only 3 trails in IL listed. Good turn-by-turn directions (written).""Rail-Trails Midwest Great Lakes"" is a good update, good maps 113 trails 23 in IL."
4,"let these fools know, ricky drops another gem!","you have to admit, ricky's camera has captured specific moments in time when new york was for the most part, very raw and exciting. from snaps on the sneak tip on Ave A. to flicks of method man hangin in the east vil, powell has produced another instant classic for all hip hop fans and other pop culture enthusiasts to enjoy."
2,"After 3 months, still not sure","I have been using this gel for over three months with little to no change to my acne scars. In defense of the product, I have only been applying once a day instead of it's recommended twice a day. Also, it says to consistently apply for 3 to 6 months so i will continue and am going to up the applications to twice a day. Will update the review..."
5,love this product,It is not sticky or greasy comforting to rub on fresh scar almost cooling I think it helps with healing because you have to rub the scar so you don't get adhesions and this makes that a pleasure
2,Scar Gel,I recently had back surgery which left me with a large scar on my back. I tried silicon bandages at first but it was hard to apply them on my back by myself. I found this gel and gave it a try. I applied it generously following directions 4 or 5 times every day for 9 weeks and the scar was only 2 weeks old when I started. Absolutely no difference from 9 weeks ago. I'd give it 1 star but at least the gel makes massaging the area easier which eases some discomfort.
5,I am sure that the story in this book is very touching,I was born in Burma (post independence era) of Indian Descendants. I would love to read this book but at the same time I am concern that I might get too sad for it would remind me about the Japanese Occupation era in Burma that costed my grandfather's life (for no good reason). May be I will read it someday when I can handle the pain a little better.
4,Please correct photo and product page description,"silly me for not looking closer at the title, I went off of the picture and details listed on the page. the product description mentions chrome plating and the photo shows a chrome badge with a loop badge snap. The actual product however which I overlooked in the title is a matte black version which does have the metal cable but had a metal spring loop (somewhat like a safety pin) rather than a snap loop. My fault for not reading title versus description, but would help future buyers if description and photo represented actual product. Still seems to be decent, just mismatched information."
1,What a disappointment!,"I have used other books in this series and was quite happy with them. But after reading the first few pages in this poorly constructed book, I could see it was only going to frustrate me with it's blatant and carelees errors. Some of the questions were appreciated, but over all it was not worth the time to even scan over it. Too many errors for my liking...Here is a simple explaination found before the 1st chapter.....We all know that the minimum RAM required to install Sever 4.0 is 16MB...right? According to this book..both Workstation and Server require 32MB!!!! DAHHHH"
1,An extremely poor quality book,"I've read several books on the MCSE courses. All of them have some errors. Some have more than others. This one has more than any I've come across. I do not recommend using this book at all. For the money, there are many other places you can acquire a bank of questions that are substantially more acccurate and relevant."
4,Great Review Material!,"This book is a great example of the entire TestPrep series (see my reviews on the Server and Workstation books in this series). You CANNOT pass the test just by reading THIS book. (Trust me, I learned the hard way!) You must get a good understanding of the material FIRST (MS Press's self-paced study guide is excellent). Before you take the test (a few days), get this TestPrep to reinforce the material you will be tested on. If used this way, the book is excellent! Last hint to those of you taking the test: Take this test (70-58) LAST (you will find many questions are similar to questions on the Workstation, Server, and TCP/IP tests!)"
2,"Errors, Errors, and more Errors","If you can figure out all the errors, then you will probably pass the (70-58) exam. This book was very poorly edited. The concept and design is good, and would be a great help to anyone wanting to pass the (70-58) exam, if it did not have so many errors."
2,error.........,"many error, make you confuse......... but better than question included in new riders study guide of netorkink essential.........."
4,like for them to try a remake of this,"When I first saw this film I was 10 and it was on channel ""Z"" (remember that far back?) It took me almost 20 years to find it on Vhs , and when I finally did, the picture was faded, and the sound was kinda muffled, but I bought it anyways for 49 cents. I am looking forward to the dvd release, and I would like to see it restored, for all its worth, it is a good story. Maybe hollywwod will remake this , like black christmas and many others"
3,Crafts of Florida's First People,"I bought this book on line while doing research on weaving with palm fronds and other natural materials. It depicts a pretty broad range of natural material crafts and I certainly learned a few things I did not previously know....but unfortunately for me it did not go in depth in the specific area of my interest. Otherwise, it is interesting and informative."
4,Excellent overview of military evolution continued,"Black continues to chronicle the progression of military tactics in the sequel to Warfare in the Western World 1775-1882. The main topics are World War I and II, naval advances and the advent of airpower. Black continues to provide a well researched thesis that is well written and illustrated."
5,One of the best sci-fi fantasy series ever,"One of the best sci-fi fantasy series ever., 25 September, 2003Reviewer: Michael Slater from AustraliaWhy this author is not better known is beyond me. Having just completed his first series ""The Firstworld Chronicals"", i was hooked and wanted more. I found the series compelling and i was unable to stop untill i had finished. If you are looking for an enjoyable read then seek out these books (they can still be found) and have a good read."
5,Igloo #4101 10 gallon,"This product worked out perfectly for our outdoor beverage station, at our country club this summer. I was impressed & it takes alot to impress me."
1,Not that great,I had one of these when they first came out - I even bought it at Home Depot... it was the best transmitter for the price. This one I got off Amazon (for a friend) is really terrible. You have to hold it in a certain position in the car or it's all fuzzy. I am really disappointed that the quality of this product has gone down so much.
1,Not very good.,"Didn't work very well. I was able to pick-up my MP3 player on one of my car stereo stations, but it wasn't as clear as the music on CD's. I'll be sticking with CD's."
1,DO NOT BUY - ITEMS ARE DIRTY AND NOT NEW,"Do not buy from this seller, the items are NOT NEW, they are filthy dirty used scratched items, seller never answered my e-mail requesting a new product or refund, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER."
3,Strangely Elusive...,"Choi's debut novel is more engrossed in creating beautiful and artistic sentences than telling a story with believable characters and a coherent plot. I think the telling of it has great potential, but Choi never takes it to the apex of its possibilities. The story revolves around an ""unlikely love affair"", an interracial courtship ritual that revolves around an exasperating character escaping war torn Korea and an attractive Southern belle in the 1950s. As a reader I found it baffling how someone as dry and two-dimensional as the Korean Chang could be the subject of *anyone's* affection. He speaks little and may be endowed with existentialist fatalism but not much more. Chang is cowardly, faulty, mostly afraid, and above all, difficult to identify with, at least from this reader's point of view, making Katherine's choice to fall in love with him even more incredible, which resigns me to believe that some stories can only be told in fiction and forgotten."
4,A brilliant first novel,"_The Foreign Student_ is a great novel. Not only is it well written; it is a refreshingly new take on the immigrant experience. Rather than waste her time whining about how bad white Americans treat those different from themselves, Choi concentrates on the psychologies of her characters, showing how a young Korean studying in America and a ""ruined"" young woman of the old-style South can overcome their respective traumas and find a powerful and significant love for each other. Choi's prose is well-paced and rhythmic, making her novel a fast read. And while _The Foreign Student_ isn't a truly difficult novel, it's not one that skirts around any issues--Choi confronts everything head on. A must read."
3,Put it down,"I'm 130 pages in and putting it down. Choi is a good writer and writes some great sentences, but this book is too analytical and detailed. I like the potential dynamic between the two protagonists, but going through the Korean and Katherine-history flashbacks done wore me out. Some of her word choices are just plain awkward too.I personally like novels with a little more forward momentum. What's really frustrating is that when I went onto Amazon to look up Choi, I discovered that I had done the *same* thing with another of her books, ""A Person of Interest."" A good argument for using the Amazon phone app at the bookstore."
4,"Brilliant, Searing, Flawed","Katherine Monroe and her mother, Glee, are two of the most vivid women I have encountered in fiction for quite a long time. I began reading this book about two years ago, and although I put it down, I never was able to put out of my mind the opening chapter, when Chuck arrives at Sewanee and meets Katherine for the first time. Finally I have read the entire book, and I feel that it will haunt me for quite a while. One flaw in this beautiful novel is the love affair between Katherine and Chuck. I don't see that these very different people would attract one another. I found myself rooting for the depraved Charles Addison. Another flaw lies in the sometimes-lengthy flashbacks to the Korean War. They were sometimes labored and struck me as the product of fastidious research rather than first-hand knowledge (which would be impossible given Choi's birth in 1969). Aside from this, the novel is well worth reading and I look forward to Choi's future novels."
5,"A breathtaking, heartbreaking, rib-expanding first novel.","A friend in San Francisco went to see Ms. Choi read and brought this book home for me. For the next two days, I came to work bleary-eyed and happy.The book is divided between the Korean War and American south, and Choi weaves in and out of both effortlessly -- the love affair unfolds like the petals of a flower, each more interesting and complex, and the War sections are as powerful as anything by Remarque or Orwell.She excels at intimate scenes -- a couple in a kitchen or a car -- her skill at limning the unspoken tensions between Chang and Katherine is astonishing. Watch for the scene in which the two drive to Chattanooga together. And -- the dissolution of the affair betwen Katherine and an aging professor is precise and poignant. And the ending is just... well, I won't give that away, but it's a doozy.There's a lifetime's worth of experience and wisdom in this book. I hope Ms. Choi's got it in her to do it again!"
1,Completely Useless,"I was very disapointed with this book. The history section is woefully brief (11 pages covering 1494 to the present day).Thepeople section is just a list of names (some with dates) with no other information. The 16 pages of lyrics contain just two songs in English (The Girl From Ipanema and Waters of March, great songs but readily available from many other sources).The same two songs represent the scores part of the book. Again, these songs are available from other sources and are reproduced toosmall to be able to read anyway. The list of recordings has noinformation beyond date, composer, and singer. The ""book"" is cheaply bound, a waste of paper, and completely usless"
5,Plantations on the Mississippi River,"A great tool for the Louisiana/Mississippi genealogy/histoty buffs. It lists the owners of the land and the name of the plantations. I found it to be accurate. It is also beautiful, a perfect wall decoration for a den or study. Mary Rettig"
1,Plantations on the Mississippi River,I thought I was ordering a book. When I got it it was just a map. I have returned it to you.Elise
5,Very nice watch for the money,I bought the watch for knocking around on the weekends. The watch has accurate time and the set up time for both the analog and digit time clocks was not hard to do. I found the watch band which is plastic to be comfortable and goes on and off as easy as a better leather band.
3,"Good Watch, But with a catch!!!","I like this watch, but it deffinately has its fualts. For instance it is nearly impossible to read or see at night. Other than that this makes for a great watch, not so much for an adult but maybe more of a kid or teenager kind of a watch. It is alittle bit more plasticy than it looks but other than that i enjoy it."
4,Good day use watch,"I bought this watch along with another more expensive Casio when my old Casio broke. This watch works perfectly fine and looks good, but is useless at night. There is no backlight so you can't tell time at night."
1,Broken within 5 weeks,The pin holding the strap broke within 5 weeks of light use.This also meant that I lost the watch because without one side pin the entire watch fell away from my wrist.Will NOT recommend these low end Casio watches.
5,Excellent watch for the price,I prefer analog watches to digital and this watch gives both. Dial is easy to read. I believe it is a great watch for the price. The analog time is simpler to set than any other combination watch I have ever owned.
4,It's really great but...,I love this watch.It's really nice for me its really basic. The only real bad thing about it is that it's a little hard to read in the dark. And when you set up the watch hands you can't reverse it so you will have to start over again if you mess up but besides it's really great watch for me. It's also not to big for me and it's not to small. It's the perfect size if you want something the right size and not to bulky.
3,Good watch to beat up on,"Small, inexpenive, durable. I swam with this for a long time, and the waterproofing holds up well. The clear watch face can and will scratch very easily though, it is annoying to have to look beyond when checking the time."
3,Casio Men's AW49H-1BV watch,Not up to the usual Casio standards. It seems cheap and somewhat complicated to get to the various functions. In shaort it was less than I expected.
2,First one dead out of the box. Second one intermittent,"My goal was to find a dual time zone watch for travelling that wasn't too expensive in case I left it at some airport security checkpoint. unfortunately, this Casio was not a good choice. The first one I received didn't work at all so I sent it back. The second one I received worked acceptably for about 2 weeks but is now intermittent. Since it costs me shipping each time I return this product, I'm hoping the second watch will straighten out and run consistently. In the future I will look to spend more money to achieve ""best value"" rather than aiming for the cheapest watch."
5,Great phone,"At first I thought it might be too small but once I got used to it I found it easy to use. I had a much more expensive phone that failed, I replaced it with this and can not believe how much money I wasted on the other phone. This has even better sound and every one I asked said they could hear me loud and clear. The headset that comes with it is OK but I do not like one that goes in the ear, I use the over-the-head set that came with the phone that died and it is loud and clear."
5,Spectra MP-6 I FOUND YOU,"I traveled all around my city of Buffalo looking 4 this little baby. I work long hr as a home care aide,just purchased the magic jack. needed this small phone to put in nap-pack. I had this phone many years ago and now to find it again was awesome! I mean I went to at least 6 stores not-ta one. finally after hours of internet search I typed in corded head phone . Lo and behold amazon popped up first. Thank you for being there. Now I just sit tight and wait. Let seller know if there was a discount on the s&h then I would have ordered 2 right now."
3,Interesting...,"Interesting overall, especially if you're curious about that lifestyle. Towards the end got a little redundant. Steve Urbauer"
2,"Interesting, but terribly out-dated","With original publication in 1940, this book brings to life only the ""basics"" of the con, important to know, yet, in this modern era of so many new embellishments, woefully inadequate.More specifically: the ""legalization"" of all sorts of con games is becoming a threat to every business person and consumer. This trend is totally missed.A much better book for the hi-tech era is Les Henderson's, Crimes of Persuasion: Schemes, Scams, Frauds. It is a virtual encyclopedia of the Modern Con."
1,I was conned,"""The Big Con: The Story of a Confidence Man"" is a book that could have been written in less than one fifth of the pages used. There are only three actual cons mentioned, the most famous of which was the plot line of the movie called ""The Sting."" After explaining the long and short con, the book drones on covering the same dismal topics over and over again. I read two thirds of it and skimmed the rest...I would call it a waste of time and money."
2,Not that good at all except for 2 or 3 tracks,"I am quite surprised at reading so much praise for this album. I happened to get my hands on a european 12"" single with ""L.A. L.A."" and ""Un-Alone"" on it at the height of the ""cow-punk"" craze. I really liked those two tracks. So I searched for the LP and managed to get it many a moon later at a record exchange shop, only to find that except for the odd other track, nothing on it was as strong as the songs I already had. I suspect, however, that this band is quite good as before I finally got ""No Time Like Now"", I got a US promo 12"" EP (""Standing In Line"") from a later period (1985/6) that was indeed quite good. So, my advice is: listen before you buy ""No Time Like Now""."
1,They did not send me the cooler in the picture.,AceHardware Online sent me a 48 qt cooler with no drain that only holds 56 cans. It says 56 cans on the sticker on the cooler. The only similar thing about it is the color!
4,this is stunning,"I don't know why noone hasn't yet written about BHAB. they are one of the best ""emo"" bands and here you have their only lp. a masterpiece of course. buy this, you won't regeret it.what you should mean when you say..mmhh..emo, that is beautiful, emotional and haunting melody."
5,Panic Busters,"Having suffered panic attacks myself for nearly 19 years, I was thrilled to find a book that could actually help me. After reading many secular books on panic disorder over the years and getting nowhere, Bonnie's book helped me believe God had a better plan for me...which didn't include panic attacks. Bonnie tells of her own experience with panic attacks and how God delivered her through prayer and trusting Him to help her. This book is perfect for Christians because it points you straight to the Bible. My search is over as far as books on panic attacks are concerned. Following the guidelines set forth in Bonnie's book I really do believe I can overcome, which is something I once thought was impossible. This is a book of hope for anyone who suffers from panic attacks."
2,Fundamental Prattle,"I suffer from panic attacks, so I pick up pretty much any book I come across dealing with them, but I wish I had left this one on the shelf. This book basically informs you that the answer to your chemical imbalance is God. Uh, what? How exactly is God going to help me rebalance the neurotransmitters in my brain? I admit I didn't even get all the way through this book, but its message was clear: it's not therapy or medication or meditation or exposure that's going to cure you, its a deity that the author just assumes that you believe in."
4,Reggaeton Gold,Hello mate!..the cd inside was okay but the outside arrive broked thanks good nothing hapend to the cd inside next time i suggest you better pack the item in a box and not in a envelop...but thanks I like the cd a lot
1,Misleading,"Item that arrived was not the item that was shown as the product. The item shown also had a rope attached to the two ""doggy golfballs"" which is very misleading since the item that arrived were the two ""golfballs only and not the rope attachment that the picture shows."
1,Do not waste your time on this,"Very shoddy workmanship, arrived scratched and dented with on instructions or mounting hardware. Not wory of Amazon"
3,"If you saw the film ""Kohee Jikko"" (""Cafe Lumiere"" in English) ...",...this is the Taiwanese composer the young woman was doing her research on.
3,"Hayne's Manuals are good, but not for my vehicle...","I have used Hayne's manuals before for a Honda Civic and Peugot 306 and was very happy with the detailed information it provided... however, this was not the case for me this time! I am an international customer with a Mazda B2500 turbo diesel and this was the only Hayne's manual that covered it. Sad to say info was lacking, and eventually I resorted to Mazda's owners manual (at the back there were maintenance instructions).Nothwithstanding this, there was useful information at the back showing the electrical schematics for the different models, but not enough info on my model to justify the purchase. Hope this helps other potential buyers."
1,Dont waste your money,"If your looking for much more than how to change the oil, look elsewhere. WAY too generic, but fits the bottom of the bird cage well."
1,Product not received yet,"Since the delivery from Amazon, everything looking well, but I don't received the book yet. I believe the delay could be from mail services here, but I can find my package. Could you help me?"
3,Good if not life-changing,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, particularly from hearing many glowing recommendations. It's a good book to be sure, with good tips that are real-world applicable even if you have no interest in running off and joining a monastery. But I couldn't help but feel like I wanted a bit more when I was finished. Maybe I was expecting a little more life-changing insight when what I got was simply practical advice.Either way, I did thoroughly enjoy this short collection of letters, even if I didn't quite seem to connect with it as strongly as others clearly have. I'd recommend it if you're interested in expanding your understanding of mindfulness and meditation and bring a little extra peace to your life, just don't expect it to be more than it is (mindfulness may indeed be a miracle, but this book doesn't quite feel like something that dramatic).I'd like to give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me."
4,Relaxing and meditative in itself,"This book is stimulates meditation during reading. Nhat Hanh, a remarkable writer about engaged Buddhism has a wonderful way of encouraging the reader to smile. While he does not distill the underlying ideologies of Buddhism, he brings to light tangible aspects of meditation that can truly help in everyday life"
4,Very inspiring ... good first book on meditation,One of the first books I read on meditation ... a friend gave it to me as a college graduation gift. Gives very nice basic meditations and talks about the kind of mindset you need to stay cool all the time.
3,"a good, fast read","Enjoyable. The parable method of telling stories really makes it impossible to put the book down. I read it all in one night. I gave it a three review because it was not my cup of tea. I am more of the kind of person who needs step by step instruction. Even in meditating. I gained great insight randomly from the book. It was fun. I just didn't walk away saying ""now I know what Mindfulness is"" and more importantly ""how to practice it"". Don't get me wrong, it has lots of examples. Each 95% exactly the same as the previous. Trust me...for the price, it is so worth it. Way better than wasting the money on a movie. If nothing else it is entertaining. I have read other Hanh books, and they are very much written the same, so I don't fault this book. It is personal preference."
4,This is a good one,"What I particularly liked about it was that I felt it took the subject of meditatitive ""mindfulness"" and applied it to it's usage during the waking course of everyday life -- that is, to noticing what's in you and around you at any given time, i.e., engaging life. Usually I find the subject of meditation treated as recommending a solitary way of retreating from the disturbing pressures of life (sit, cross your legs, breathe....) That's good, some need it, I don't particularly. But this was a good one."
2,Eastern babbling,"After reading several very interesting articles about meditation on the NYT and various sources, including The Shamatha study ([...])I decided to buy this book. I have practice meditation on and off and I do have actually noticed that smiling and focusing on breath can make you feel much better. Once you know that, there is absolutely nothing to find in this book. All the pseudo philosophical discourse is cheap, amateurish, worthy of the TV series Kung Fu. As I read the book I almost heard somebody called be grasshopper. So do yourself a favor, if you want to meditate, just sit in a calm and quiet room, start focusing on your breath, put a smile on your face and don't bother about the nonsense in The Miracle of Mindfulness. Instead go to the address listed above, read about the story. This people know and understand why meditation works. The author of the book doesn't."
1,Disappointment,"A total disappointment. This book just tells you you have to be mindful of what you are doing, with little detials showing you how to achieve the mindfulness. A complete waste of money.That said I have to say that I am quite impressed by some of the other books written by the author."
3,Easy read,"Interesting, easy to read and follow the author. Didn't agree with everything, but overall it's alright. I had to read it for a class.Book received as described by the seller."
4,Read again and again,I first read this book during a yoga teacher training program. I love the way that we are asked to see our simplest tasks in our day. Mindfulness is a wonderful subject to keep with me each and every day and this book certainly helps with the process.
4,Meaningful and balanced,"This book is another in the successful list of Thich Nhat Hahn's books. He balances his stories with meaningful lessons on the act of mindfulness. If one is looking to enhance the practice of right mindedness, this is one to read! I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt it to be slightly more personal than some of his others."
4,The Janis Project,"This is book has been around and I think it is an excellent teen girl book. Author Nancy Rue does a great job addressing teen issues. The book is told through Janis' point of view. Going to a new school is a challenge at any age, even more so as a teen. Janis affects the lives of many people while she struggles with her issues which include lose of her mother and a move."
2,mechanic apron,I'm a woodworker and six foot tall and I feel this apron is smaller than I thought. The neck strap should be longer and softer or at least a felt liner attached.
4,Works Well in Garage,"I work on several motorcycles at my home. I like the apron for keeping by clothes clean, but also for the extra pockets for holding tools and parts while working. The split in the front makes it easy to bend down and not be constrained by the apron. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the latch for the waste is a little hard to reach since it is not in the front."
2,Falling apart,"After just three uses in a classroom environment, the outer seam started to fall apart. It seems to be a big hassle to get it replaced and it didn't cost very much so I didn't bother trying. I would have thought it would have been made to withstand at least a DYI garage environment."
1,Unreadable,"I have to agree with P. Menconi: regardless of the merits of the book, this Kindle edition is unreadable because no effort was made to clean up the OCR scan.E.g. as far as I can tell throughout the entire book the word ""Rim"" appears as ""Ri m"" That's a pretty big problem in a book called The Rim of Space, and that's one of the relatively benign screw ups. I borrowed it for free as a Prime member, but I just couldn't read it. You'd have to be crazy to pay a dime for it, let alone the $9.99 the publisher is asking."
4,good quality but too expensive,"This is a wonderful flashlight, but I think that it is perhaps too expensive. I bought it on year ago, and I'm thinking that I could have saved some money if instead of buying this flashlight I would have bought a regular one ($20) and rechargeable batteries ($20-30).The bulb did not last too much (5 months I think). A positive thing is that cradle is a great idea.I'm giving to it four stars because think that it is a wonderful piece, but I think that the price should be around $50 or $60 not $110 or so..."
4,Mag Lites,"Even though we had to wait a short time due to quantity, the items were shipped in a timely manner."
2,MAGLITE RX1019 HEAVY DUTY RECHARGEABLE,"I RATED THIS ITEM A TWO, BECAUSE WHEN I RECEIVED THE ITEM IT NEVER TURN ON. SINCE IT WASN'T WORKING I DECIDED TO RETURN THE ITEM AND GET MY MONEY BACK. THE RETURN WASN'T A PROBLEM AT ALL I GOT REFUND ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT I PAID."
1,A piece of you know what!,"I wanted a Mag rechargeable flashlight for some time, but just could not justify the expense. Well, I finally bought it, and what a dissappointment. I will say , it is an excellent flashlight WHEN IT WORKS. I got all of 5 minutes out of it when I first used it. I diagnosed the problem as a failed bulb, as I could clearly see the filament was broken. I ordered a replacement which was NOT CHEAP. It too lasted 5 minutes, and yes, I know enought not to touch the bulb with my bare fingers while installing. Bought two more bulbs next time around, and you guessed it, about 5 minutes use for each. So, all totaled about $125 for 20 minutes of light. Run from this deal."
5,Pro Mag,This was for bedroom as an emergency light. It is rechargeable and easy to mount... probably doubles as a good head smacker too if ever needed... g-d forbid.
4,The allmost perfect flashlight,"As a police officer,I can say,that this flashlight comes as an integral part of a standard equipment in any police patrol car in Israel, and it stands the hardest tasks and conditions, one of the best choices the department has made, The only flaw is the recharge socket, I wish they will build somthing stronger that would not break all the time."
3,good flashlight for the price,"Maglite is a good flashlight for the price.But What I wanted more was,1. smaller & lighter2. much more brighter & focused beam3. LED instead of halogen/Xenon for longer life.Only after seeing ""wolf-eye Pilot whale 1000 lumen"",I realizethat LEDs can be so brighter.There is an LED upgrade option available for magcharger byTerraLUX TLE-300MR MiniStar30MR 600 Lumens LED Upgrade for Mag Charger Rechargeble Flashlightwhich looks much better.see it in action video [...]Also all Magcharger models are having same lumen, only difference is theac/dc/europe chargers, spent some time searching that.Also checkStream light 76811 Polystinger DS LED Flashlight with 120-Volt AC, Blackwhich is brighter LEDfor an additional $20.Top bright LED flashlights are also available from these brands(some of them available in Amazon)wolf-eyeultrafireeagletecfenix.Hope these helps someone trying to find a brighter flashlight"
1,1968-1982 No Picture repair with eyes closed manual,Haynes as usual tends to explain in writing but only shows in picture a few of the late model year designs. I have a 1968 vette and their book did not have a single pic to help explain the tear down or rebuild process of anything. If you can read a page and with no pictures perform the task then you might get some use out of this book. If your smart you'll buy a Chiltons.
3,haynes corvette repair,"This book wastes space teaching you how to be a mechanic. It does not give good wiring diagrams, no vacuum system diagrams, no emission system diagrams, and no rear suspension or exhaust system breakdowns. I bought this book locally, sealed in plastic. It looks good sitting on my workbench, but I wasted my money."
3,Haynes Review for Corvettes 68-82,"Book has considerable info on rebuilding the engine, but not that much on other portions of the car such as the interior."
4,Nice to have on the shelf,"These are not necessarily the best reference, but lots better than no reference, and a lot cheaper than a factory manual. If you have some standard fixes, and need a bit of help. this book will fit the bill. Something major or extra specific and you might have to choke for a factory manual. Worth buying."
3,disapointed,I wanted to disassemble the steering column on my vette and bough this book to help me out. Disappointingly it dosent cover that at all but nether did any of the other books a bough for the same purpose. one of them actually said don't go there.
1,Ignore this One!!!!!,This was a Made-For-TV movie from the eighties. The color was great and the acting was fair but the plot was not so hot. George Peppard and Pernell Robertsd are in it but the movie is boring and predictable. The sets do not seem real and the Indians look fake. Western movie lovers will see the flaws right away and will turn the movie off. No wonder this film was so cheap--you get what you pay for. Don't bother with it-even for rental.
2,wasted cast,"A good well known cast of many familiar faces from T.V. series and movies of the 60's and 70's, great desert locations, authentic looking wardrobe, but the boring dialog and lack of action does this no justice. Great to see all these actors together in one movie, L.Q. Jones is very restrained in his performance compared to his other work. Bo Svenson is almost unrecognizable as a big german settler(with accent). The DVD picture and audio is surprisingly very good for the company that put out the sloppy ""Branded"" discs."
4,Excellent Made for TV Movie,"Excellent western movie with nice scenery and well known stars. DVD picture and sound is excellent. The only complaint I had about the DVD was it paused and stopped about half way through the movie; however, it might have just been the DVD I purchased."
1,Not Originals,I was excited when I saw the titles on this CD as they brought back a lot of memories from my childhood but when I received the CD I was dismayed to find out that the songs were performed by some cover band. I would never have purchased it in the first place had I known but I was mislead by the artist description as VA which I assumed meant various artists. It obviously does not in all cases. I really wish Amazon would put in the description whether the songs are original artists and original recordings. I did not even open the CD. I just sent it back. Don't waste your money if you are looking for originals.
1,Not even worth 1 star,"I was very disappointed after receiving this item. The Web page never said anything about the ""Countdown Singers"" performing the songs. So I purchased it believing it would contain recordings from the original artists. I didn't think I would need to read the reviews before I bought the CD. I have several various artists CDs and when searching these CDs, it generally states clearly if the CD does not contain original versions. I was pleased, however, with Amazon.com's response to this snafu. The CSR said I would receive a full refund, after inspecting the Web page and realizing that the CD was not described properly."
1,Useless Pillow,"This pillow was completely useless. The foam was so lightweight, that once i sat on it, it collapsed into a flat pancake. Offered no support whatsoever. I've had much better luck with the hard foam pillows. Luckily i was able to quickly return this item and get a full refund. Avoid it. It's worthless!"
2,Cushion,"This is a latex ring covered by a very cheap fabric. It's fairly comfortable, however I don't see it holding up very long."
2,not as expected,The cushion is not steardy enough and when you sit down you can hardly tell the difference.
2,Useful but not overly so.,This product was ok. In my experience with it if i was in need of the pillow I probably just should sit somewhere else. It made some of those moments that I absolutely had to use a pillow a little better but not a whole lot there probably is a better product out there if you need a pillow over a long period of time. I probably wouldn't buy this particular pillow again if I were to do it all over again to save a little bit of the pain instead of the 10 or so dollars that I saved instead.
4,Go big!,This pillow works fine. I am a thin person of average height so I thought the 16 inch pillow would be better than the 18 inch. The best advice I can give is go big. The 16 inch is too small even for my tiny rear end.
2,Too small for an adult,"This cushion feels and looks smaller than the description. The 'cut out' section is so small that the ring puts pressure just where you do not want it. I returned it for the 18"" ring which just barely works. I'm only 100 pounds but my sciatica and cocyx pain require a pillow that will keep the pressure off!"
4,comfort and not costly,Does the job and is easily taken on the road. Foam is still lofty after 6 months.
4,Nice variety but could use a few more insects...,"I bought this set for my 7 year old niece and we viewed it together. The specimens seem very professionally done -- well-dyed, clearly labelled, and constructed to stand up to the type of rough handling you'd expect from little hands. There are 5 specimens per slide so there really is a lot here to look at. There's a broad variety of subjects and enough ""odd"" items to inspire lots of questions. Of everything we viewed, it was (surprisingly) the pollen samples that drew the most oohs and aahs from my niece. We did both find ourselves wishing for more insects, and the textile samples were rather ""ho-hum"", but overall this is a nice set and, I think, worth the purchase."
1,Not good,Slides are too small and difficult to see with the accompanying telescope. However it may be the faulted the smithsonian telescope that I bought with it
1,NEVER GOT THE ITEM,"THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE A GOOD PRODUCT, AS OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE OPPOSITE EXPERIENCES, SO I DO NOT KNOW. ONE THING FOR SURE, I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING THAT SHIPS FROM AUCTION LIQUIDATORS. THEY MAILED ME THE WRONG ITEM TWICE AND THEN DECIDED TO REFUND INSTEAD OF SENDING ME THE CORRECT ITEM WHICH IS CURRENTLY ADVERTIZED ON AMAZON. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING LEARNING RESOURCES PREPARED SLIDES, ST 11 GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! YOU'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK!"
2,"Not a ""best"" buy",Bought this for our nephew for a small microscope(he's eight)I bought him earlier. The slides are overpriced and not of much use. Not a good buy.
5,Great Christian Bluegrass!,I got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves Doyle Lawson and this has some of his best music!
4,Not half bad,"When I took a composite materials course as a senior at NCSU, the teacher didn't. In a fit of desperation, I went to the bookstore and looked at all (3) composite books. This one used the same symbology as my prof's lecture notes, so I bought it, despite the price.What a great investment! The first chapter gives an excellent overview of the ""why?"" of composites. Chapters 2-end give you everything you every needed to know about composite mechanics (at least at the senior undergraduate level.)With this book, I learned the material and passed the course quite easily.Complaint: Like most textbooks, it gives very little coverage of computer modelling. Some, but not as much as I would have liked. It helped me pass the concept parts of the course, but I had to sink-or-swim on my own when it came time to write code.Other than that complaint, this is an excellent introductory book."
2,"Nice pictures, no value","I'm a final-semester senior at the University of Kentucky in Mechanical Engineering and I purchased this book as required reading for my composites class. Here's the thing: the book doesn't really say that much of anything. It spends all of its time stating equations for particular types of composites without specifying why it's doing it or how it got from equation to equation. As a matter of fact, all the chapter-end review questions seem to be are ""hey, bet you can't figure out how we got from equation 4.56 to equation 4.57."" It makes for somewhat easier homework because it's simple algebra and trig most of the time, but what am I learning, exactly? I usually try to justify books like this as saying, well, at least maybe I'll use it as a reference book in the future...but this book's just horrible. I would recommend you not buy this unless it's required of you for any particular class. Hope this helps."
3,composites-trends,well written book . more practical application would have been appreciated. more information on trends in grp for next say 10 years
5,Dental care at its best!,"Even though this toothbrush has no exciting lights and sounds like those pricy high-tech toothbrushes they sell on television, it makes any SpongeBob fan; 2-102 enjoy brushing their choppers. I know that it makes my morning when I see Patrick and Spongebob, my two favorite cartoon personalities at my sink. ^^"
1,Complete Garbage,"This book is emblematic of much of what is dysfunctional about legal education in the U.S. It's nothing more than a poorly-edited compilation of poorly-edited cases, with almost no background information or unifying commentary. The little commentary that it does contain makes simple concepts appear very complicated, and makes virtually no effort to synthesize concepts together into anything even resembling a useful framework. This book is not worth one-tenth of its sales price."
1,Utter junk. Convince your professor to use something else.,"This book is far and above the single worst textbook that I have ever used, bar none. The layout is utterly unhelpful, the selection and order of cases unnecessarily confusing, and the comments perplexing. If you're assigned Dawnson on Contracts as a 1L, best of luck!"
3,Cover up good,"It came with very strong plastic smell. Leave it in the air for days, whole house smell it. Weeks later it's okay. My dog is mid size, the meadium can not fit my dog. Material is good for rain jacket."
2,X-Large Dog Rain Jacket,"This jacket has a strong chemical odor that has not left even after multiple washings. The jacket itself is too short and the hood does not reach my Golden Retriever's head. It would be nice if the jacket also prevented my dog's belly from getting wet. The only plusses are the bright color and reflective stripes, which make my dog visible in the dark. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this product."
2,Not for large-headed dogs!,"You can't tell from the pictures or description, but this goes on by slipping over the dog's head -- like a hoodie sweatshirt. I followed all the sizing guidelines, and even sized up for my ""stouter"" breed, and this thing still barely squeezed over my doggie's head (a very petite 110 pound St. Bernard in an XL). Once on, the hood did not fully contain her head, let alone her years, which stuck out the front, while she looked at me with that exasperated expression St. Bernard's give so well. The length dimension was fine. And yes, the raincoat did smell funny. Needless to say, I will be returning mine, and finding a raincoat that has a chest strap."
5,good quality,"Well made and surprisingly good quality for the price. It is a little long for my 20 pound dog and a little snug on my 40 pound dog, but it will work just fine."
2,BAD SMELL,had to try an air this item out. The smell did not go away. I also tried to use 409 and it still smells. Smells like old railroad ties.
3,Raincoat,I only gave it a rating of 3 stars because for a large it was quite snug. Any smaller and it wouldn't have fit at all. Hard to get a collar & leash under it.
3,Came REEKING of Moth Balls,"How long was this thing is storage? I tried washing it once and then sprayed it down with Fabreeze but it still stinks to the point that I wouldn't even put it on my dog! And, I have to store it in a ziplock plastic bag so the stink isnt going to fade anytime soon."
4,Works well for huskies,We have a 9 yr. Old husky. She doesn't like to wear the hood but she is fine with the rest. I like the color too. She gets away too often the orange and flourecent yellow strips are great
2,Guardian Gear Rain Jacket XXL Orange,"I got the orange XXL. One of the elastic leg straps came detached at the stitching during the first use. This cause the rain coat to shift to one side exposing my dog's rear to the rain. I would suggest wider straps and stronger sticking. If you find a way to keep this coat on, you've got a great coat for your dog.Guardian Gear Rain Jacket Xlg Yellow"
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware -- using this product MAY be hazardous to you or your pet's health. (Sorry, I don't have the funds to do a scientific inquiry to prove it--nor does the US--so buyer beware. I should have looked at the other reviews before I bought this product. It looked like it would work well for my dog. When I got the product out of the package it smelled highly toxic--touching it it would leave a toxic smell on my hands as well. I was so concerned I aired it outside several days hoping the ""off gassing"" would alleviate the problem. That didn't work. I washed it in the washing machine--the smell did not go away, and still left a residual smell on my my hands. I threw the jacket away and thought, well, my fault--should have been more careful buying this product online. I did not want to expose my dog or myself the potential toxic residue. I felt concern for the workers in China who must be working in a factory that produces this material."
4,"Great item, but watch out for sizing!","This is a great item, but beware of the sizing--looking elsewhere online for more detailed sizing, this coat should fit my German Shepherd, but it was too small. Here is the full sizing chart:Size Fits Length Fits Necks Fits ChestsX-Small Up to 8"" 10"" - 16"" 17"" - 22""Small 8"" - 12"" 12"" - 18"" 22"" - 26""Medium 12"" - 16"" 14"" - 21"" 26"" - 30""Large 16"" - 20"" 16"" - 23"" 30"" - 34""X-Large 20"" - 24"" 18"" - 24"" 34"" - 38""XX-Large 24"" - 30"" 18"" - 24"" 38"" - 44""Others have reviewed this coat saying that it runs large--I must disagree! The item itself is wonderful, provided you get the right size!"
5,Dog Rain Coat,"I think dressing up dogs is silly. However, since my Aussie's coat soaks up water I bought him this rain coat. It covers him. I love the added reflection. We almost got hit by a car once in the rain because it was dark. Now we are more visible. He enjoys longer walks now in the rain. Best of all when we come back to the house we don't have to spend a lot of time drying off him and everything else that he use to splatter with rain after shaking his coat or rubbing on my furniture."
3,way too big,this products runs kind of large (around the belly area..the strap goes around his body twice!) so you either need to size down or make adjustments on your own. also i don't know if it's because it's too big but it looks like the raincoat would get in the way of his pee because it kind of covers his private area....not sure...so i figured i might as well exchange it but the shipping cost back and forth didn't seem worth it :/ (i have to ship it back and they also ask for an additional $2.50 shipping...only the first shipping is free) so i guess i'm making adjustments on my own now. but it looks nicely made (the material and the reflective strap)
4,"Decent coat, keeps him dry","I ordered a size XL for my lab/husky mix. He is 62 pounds. For the most part, this coat fits him well. I find the stomach strap is far too long, but the hood is not much wider than the elastic collar/opening. The hood only comes up to the base of his ears and is more like a neck cover. The coat does cover him from the base of his tail to the top of his neck, and keeps his sides dry as well. His stomach and paws are still wet/muddy after a walk, but that is a big improvement from how wet he was on rainy walks without it. I agree with others who have said this coat has a strong smell - it made our coat closet smell like plastic for a week after we got it, but the scent has gone away with use/time. Overall, the coat does it jobs and I only had minor issues with the fit/sizing."
5,keeps you cool!,"I own the whole set and it is great for everything from cookouts to baseball games, picnics, and more."
3,"Intriguing, but too much vulgarity and profanity","The book is interesting as an unsolved mystery, but everyone cannot be as guilty as they sound. I struggled a bit with the writing, and did not like all of the vulgarity and profanity. It did not add anything to the book, except to make me feel like I was overhearing conversations in a cheap bar. It was also apparent from the start that Glick does not like rich people (some peoople might call them successful). He could hardly talk about them in a civil tone. He used phrases like ""Outrageous luxury"", and ""Trophyest of trophy homes."""
1,Abolsutely awful -- a total waste of money.,"This book is atrocious. The book is only loosely about wine country weddings/events -- 90%+ of the content is rehashed advice about planning a wedding or event generally. That content can be better gotten from other wedding books. Even the web would provide better content. To the extent the book *is* about wine country weddings, it is simply a collection of 1/4 page advertisements from local vendors, events sites, etc. I can't believe Ms. Rivers-Moore actually has the temerity to charge for this book."
2,Broke right away,"We bought this thermometer and a matching clock to affix outside by our pool. It was a bit larger than I anticipated, but that was ok -- We wanted to be able to read it from inside the house as well as in the backyard. The thermometer worked great IN the box when it was in the house. But, as soon as we hung it up outside, a piece broke off the back and the thermometer completely stopped working. It was a big disappointment."
5,As good as ever!!,"""The Time of the Oath"" is yet another proof that Helloween still has a bright metal future after the departure of Kiske and Hansen. This cd follows the path marked by their previous recording ""Master of the Rings"", and they somehow managed to better its quality. This cd contains everything for everyone; from fast-paced, ultra melodic songs as ""Before the war"" and ""Steel Tormentor"", to powerful ballads such as ""If I knew"" and ""Forever and One""; metal anthems like ""Power"" and mid tempo rockers like ""A million to one"" and, of course, the epics: ""The time of the Oath"" and ""Mission Motherland"". If you've been a Helloween fan since the Keepers or before, you'll consider this record to be as great as they can offer."
2,TRYING TO IMPROVE ...,"WIth new singer Andy Deris now completely integrated in the band, Helloween tries once more to stablish themselves as a real good rock band. But they are not suceeding, I'll tell you. THis CD has good songs (""Power"" is pure energy, the slow ones are good, also), but it seems Helloween turned themselves definitely into one of a lot of bands that are bravely doing what is necessary to survive in the hostile environment we have, nowadays, towards heavy music. (at least in the great markets). But, anyway you look at it, their creativity was gone after the two ""Keeper of the Seven Keys"" albuns, or: when Kai Hansen left the band."
3,"Has Some Good Elements, But Average Overall","This album has some good elements. I find it to be on the same level as Better than Raw. Better than Raw is a little better than this album though. Everything seems to be here except for lasting power. These are songs that don't really have much longevity or staying power. Michael Kiske is sorely missed. I'm afraid to say that without him, Helloween just comes off different. Of course the musicianship and production on this album is good, it's just the fact that the songwriting could've been a little better. The songs are just too ordinary. Has ambition, but still an average album. Get Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II (that's their best)."
3,Strangely uninspired,"I'm a great Helloween-fan , both the old "" real"" groupwhen Kiske was singing in the shift 80/90 and themodern CD:s with Andy Deris.However ; even if the musicmanship as always is100 % flawless - this album can not , in any way ,competewith "" Better than raw "" or , say "" The Dark Ride "".The songs don't have the same flow,hooks or melodiesthat You would expect from this institution in finepowerish metal. I hate to say this because I like Helloweenand put my good money into this CD ; - but it reallydoes not meet with the high expextations that such alegendary band has to justify. With exception for"" Kings will be Kings"" and "" Everything my Mama don't like ""it's rather...well uninpiring.I You still want to try it , please testlisten before buying-so my unsatisfying purchase at least can help others.Well that's it - a little note is that Andy Deris actuallyis doing a really great vocal job here - unfortunatelyit is not matched by the songwriting."
4,Oath - Better than some....,"This album certainly doesn't have some of the raw power that they were known for on an album such as ""Keeper of the Seven Keys 1&2,"" or some of the earlier stuff that was added to the ""The Best, The Rest, and the Rare."" But this album still rocks. Although they admittedly deviated from some of the rougher, fantasy-related topics a little bit, the album still has lots going for it. Lots of memorable lyrics and catchy sounds really made this an album I was sorely hurt to lose when we had to move. It looks like I'm going to have to find it again; I can't wait any longer."
5,Jaw-Dropping Musicianship,"I bought this album after hearing it on the radio - little did I know almost the whole band is different than ""Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt 1"" because the sound is the same. That said, this album is amazing - guitar work, singing, and drumming. I'm a drum hack and I couldn't believe the drum tracks on this album - I'm half convinced they used a drum machine because it seems too complex for a human. Does anyone know?Although I love every tune on the CD I would like to whack the producer on the head and ask him why he had to make the sound so muddy. At times I think they must have recorded this thing on a 2 track cassette because the sounds blend together so much. I think the dynamic range is about 1 dB for the whole album - everything is just mush!"
4,Excellent metal album,"Quite simply, this album is a collection of individual acheivements in musicianship. While the lyrics could use some work at times, every member of the band demonstrates his virtuosity with his instrument. Soaring, powerful vocals; tight and imaginative bass lines; powerful guitar, both rhythm and solo; and drum work reminiscent of Neal Peart all combine to make this a thoroughly enjoyable spin. The individual performances hardly take away from the overall direction of the songs; the band is good enough to meld these efforts into a seamless, satisfying whole. In contrast to the incredible raw sound of Keeper Pt. 1, this album has a much more produced and mature sound that is just as satisfying, if in a slightly different manner. Buy it."
1,Worst book ever published,Brodkey is dead and his book is still a loud obnoxious snore. It may be the worst book ever published. Who ever called this guy talented. Is it because he went to Harvard. There is not a sigle interesting story in the waste of newsprint. I could go on but Brodkey is dead and the book is a snore.
4,rock climbing,This book is an excellent book and a great beginners guide to rock climbing as well as a guide and reference to those already into the sport and just want to check up on their skills. It provides a guide to knots and great moves. I even took this book with me on my first climb.
3,"Good stone, but bad band","Received the ring in a timely manner.The stone is lighter and more purple than the blue shown in the picture, but very pretty nontheless. I have not had it appraised and checked by my local jeweler yet, so cannot speak to the quality of the stone. To my ametuer eye, it is satisfying.However, the craftsman work on the band was the crudest I've ever seen. Not sure if it is due to the re-sizing, but I've had rings re-sized before and none came back asymmetrical."
3,Good movie (Stork Club),"The song Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief is not on this video. I was very disapponted as that is the reason I purchased it - to see Betty Hutton sing it once again. Otherwise,movie is good."
5,kids on the moon base,"In this book Midnight on the Moon the main charaicters are Annie and Jake they found a magic tree house that will take them places all they have to do is point to the place they want to go and say ""i wish to go there"" and the tree house spins and takes off! they have to find four things that starts with the letter ""m"" and they have already found three things and now they are on the moon trying to find the last thing and when they find the last thing then it will set morgan the librarian free from her spell that she is under!the three things that they have already discovered is a moonstone from the time in ninjas a mango from the amazon rain forest and a mammoth bone from the ice age!"
5,The Best Book Ever,"I give this book five stars because it is really interesting. It is educational because it tells you facts about the Moon, like: A footprint can last millions of years on the Moon because there is no wind and no rain there. It is also cool because Jack and Annie (the main characters) travel to the Moon and when they are there, they are also in the future (year 2031). I like books about time traveling and especially to the Moon."
5,Another Excellent Book,I have been reading this book to my students and they love it. Today they begged me not to stop reading it. They find this series very interesting. Even some of my reluctant readers are excited to read these books.
2,Incorrect principles?,"I have actually enjoyed reading this series to my kids. My third who's almost 6 is reading them with me now and loves them, but we just finished Midnight on the Moon and I am a little disturbed by the apparent lack of understanding on the part of the author and spreading that misunderstanding to her many young readers. You weigh less on the moon due to it's gravity, not that there is no air, and you would feel lighter in the moon base without the heavy suits on than you would out on the surface with the suits. Gravity stays the same wether indoors or out."
1,Very disappointed,"Since this series is so popular, my eight-year-old asked to get some from the library, so we checked out a few. I picked up this one, book #8, and read through it. The writing was extremely poor. I counted the statement, ""Morgan nodded,"" six times in three pages, even though each page has very few words. Can't the author or an editor see such a glaring flaw? And there were many more flaws, extremely contrived dialogue being the worst offender.The story was weak, and the characters were thin and hard to like. I can't see how this series became popular. We won't be checking them out again."
1,insipid stuff--too bad there's little else for early readers,"The only possible virtue of this book, the first and only one of the series we've encountered, is that it's perhaps light enough to encourage little ones to read for themselves. I agree completely with the reviewer who pointed out that the author seems to know little about history, science, or the English language; I'd add to that list logic. The heroine Annie is an airhead, though she's portrayed as the one who seizes the initiative; her favorite word is ""Wow."" Her brother Jack, though far more prudent, is forever saying ""Oh, man."" This is junk food, with empty mental calories. I'm sure that parents can do better and not have to settle for this dreck."
5,Good books for second graders,Good book. My son and I are hooked. He is a second grader. The best grade to be in. Thanks
3,Kendrell P.,The book was ok. It was all based on the moon. I'm not a big fan of the moon because you can't breathe on the moon. I liked when they freed Morgan because Morgan was a nice woman. Jack and Annie couldn't find the fourth M thing. I also liked that part.
3,it was awesome,"I liked it because it had adveture,action,and mystery. I think that other peaple should read this book. It is about two kids there names are Annie and Jack. Annie is a girl that is fearless. Jack is a boy that sees they need a plan. They have an amazing adventure on the moon."
4,Magic Treehouse,"If you like the moon then you'll like this book. It's about two kids named Jack and Annie who go to the moon and try to find the fourth ""m thing"" and find a moon buggy and see a moon man.I liked this book very much it was good. I recomened this to anybody 4 years or older."
3,It's okay,"I like alot of things about this travel system, however, there are also a few things I don't like about it. I really like the cup holders, the one handed steering, and the storage compartment in parent tray. I love the HUGE cargo basket! I can take my daughter into the grocery store and get $75 worth of groceries into that basket! I DON'T like the retractable tray. Ours BROKE where it swivels up and down. My less than 6 month old daughter would push on the tray with her feet, and apparantley that was enough to break it. I don't like how, when the stroller is folded, it won't stand up! All in all, it is okay. When the next baby comes, I will know what NOT to look for in a stroller and travel system."
5,Almost Perfect,"I bought this watch as an everyday watch because it seemed durable. So far, so good. However, I still can't get used to the band. Even when I make the band loose, like a bracelet, I can still feel it on my wrist. It feels like it's tight, even though it's not. I think it's because of the way the band is made; it has grooves all around it and the grooves on the inside of the band make it uncomfortable for me. I can actually feel the pressure on my wrist. Also, I wish the date were bigger; it's a bit hard to see the number. Other than those things, I think this is a good watch."
5,Excellent Sports Watch,I bought this watch over a year ago as I was tired of losing the waterproof feature of other watches due to a battery change (unless of course you send it back to the manufacturer). I chose this watch as it is the only sports watch with a citizen eco drive that I could find. It works great! I love the eco drive technology. I recently purchased one for my mother for the holidays and she too enjoys it. Worth the money.
4,A nice watch thAt is good value for money,Nice looking watch. Dial easy to read given it's size. Date almost impossible to read as too small.Quality build. Love the EcoDrive.Reading the reviews before I bought this watch I was a little worried about the band being uncomfortable etc. The band is fine. It's comfortable.Looking forward to seeing how it handles the water.
2,Great watch - not-so-great strap,"As a female diver, I REALLY wish that watch companies would realize I'm not the only one. There are so many dive watches for men, but so few for women. My husband bought this for me. I like the style and quality of the watch itself, but I really dislike the strap. It is very uncomfortable and too ""sporty"" looking. I have been on the hunt for a female dive watch with a metal strap. As soon as I find one that is reasonably priced, I will never wear this one again."
4,Citizen Women's EP6000-07H Eco-Drive Professional Diver Black Rubber Strap Watch,"I like this little watch. I think the band could have been a little more sturdy. Other than that, I like the light feel."
4,Good watch,"I am not a diver so I cannot comment on how well the watch functions in deep waters. I like the watch because it works well as an exercise watch-- no problems with shocks, and the sweat can be washed out afterwards. The design is cute and the size is perfect. And I love that it is eco-drive so you don't have to worry about replacing batteries.The band is a little chunkier than I would prefer and the date is a little bit hard to see. But overall, this is a quality watch that I would definitely recommend."
3,Review of Murphy's Law,"Reasonably good - but I didn't really like the star so got tired of the series. The acting was good - I just didn't ""feel"" for him."
4,Talent with Personality,As we view meany of our shows on nightly tv. We often just are going through the motions as we head bob our way through looking for affermation of our lives. In the case of Murphy's law we get that and more as we get to identify with this anti hero taking charge.
4,Four Star show - One Star Pricing,Have watched the first season of this show and the other reviewers are right about the quality of the programs.Nesbitt does a great job and the accents are easy on US earsThe stories are well paced and not too violent.[...]
4,Good episodes,I like the stories that this series tells; the only somewhat adverse comment that I have is that the Irish 'broge' (accent) is somtimes pretty strong and makes what the characters are saying hard to understand. This series has very interesting characters.
4,A Great New Orleans Cookbook,"The Brennan's New Orleans Cookbook is a great, classic New Orleans cookbook. (Note: I was born in NO, live in South Louisiana, and lived in NO for 5 years.) Try the recipes for Stuffed Bell Peppers, Stuffed Mirletons (use shrimp instead of crabmeat), Red Beans, Redfish Courtboullion, and Creole Jambalaya. One day I'm going to start on Page 1 and cook everything in this book!"
1,Outdated in style!,"This may very well be an excellent cook-book, what do I know?? The style (NO PICTURES) and the typography is so old-fashioned that it bores me to tears! I get no inclination to open it at all!!It is just does not appetite waking!"
1,Please don't delete bad reviews,"Previous (now deleted) reviews of this CD alerted me to its quality. The complaints were about both the nature sounds and the music. I was curious. My experience is that dogs call once and then wait for a while. The call is an announcement ('I am here' or 'this is my space'). They certainly do not have conversations. Since each dog will be miles apart and calling at random intervals, the calls should be at different volumes and at different stereo locations.I think one reviewer said it sounded like the dogs were in kennels and suffering because they were crying continuously.Intrigued, I managed to obtain a copy at a realistic price.The music IMHO is of typical quality for CDs of this genre.The reviews were accurate. The case is worth more than the contents."
3,"Great pens, til they break","I bought this multipack of refills for the Bic Steel pens--I love them and have many. But after they get a certain age (not all that old that I can tell), they will suddenly just spring apart while you're writing, and good luck trying to get them back together. The refills are pretty much unusable, just because the pens don't hold up. So I have 24 refills for pens that are breaking. Not all that useful. Sigh."
5,Soul Light: Connection Between Worlds,"What an amazing book! So easy to read and once you pick it up, you just can't put it down. Not only does it help in an understanding that will help those who are bereaved and perhaps going through an extreme questioning of ""why"" and what life is all about, it will also feed the hunger for understanding for anyone wishing further knowledge in life after death. This is just not one persons ideas on the afterlife, but it also connects with the work of Dr. Gary Schwartz and is verified by mediums Suzane Northrop, Laurie Campbell and the well known, John Edward's. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and an open heart. There is so much to be learnt from this book, including between the lines for our inner growth and understanding in a very complex world. Somehow, reading ""Soul Light"" makes it all just a little easier."
5,A Favorite of Mine,"I love this soap. It does something really nice for my skin. As a diabetic, I find it helpful in reducing dryness and itching. This is always in my shower."
1,Caused massive acne breakout...,I bought this soap to help control my acne because I learned of the benefits of Tea tree oil. It was all natural soap so it seemed all the better. Sadly after using it daily for a week I broke out like never before..I started using Benzoyl Peroxide like crazy and continued using the soap..a week later my whole face was covered. It was obvious by then that something was causing the acne. The only new product I was using was this soap..I researched its ingredients and turns out that the Coconut oil in it is highly comedogenic (clog pores) so is the palm oil...I stopped using the soap immediately. My face is much better now. I am back to using salicylic acid pads and BP. This soap may be good for body parts that are not acne-prone but not for the face. Be careful.
4,Good soap but it evaporates fast.,"The soap is great, smells OK and leaves skin feeling clean and silky but the bar does not last very long."
2,Didn't do much for my itching scalp,This shampoo didn't help relieve the itching on my scalp even though i used it every other day or so for a month.
2,Wait for the paperback -- if at all.,"I have enjoyed Sampson's writing in the past, but this book disappointed. As advertised, it really is a book about the chasing of Tiger Woods -- by competitors, fans and media. One can enjoy the ""behind the scenes"" looks at the tour, and if you are interested in Charles Howell III, you will get a bunch of info here. I felt the book headed off in too many directions, the metaphors were WAY overblown, and the lack of focus was frustrating. If you are interested in the peripheral insights to be gained, or simply love Sampson -- wait for the paperback!"
3,"Ho hum, more of the same",I read this book on a plane from San Diego to Houston. When someone asked me the next day what I had learned the only thing I could remember is that Tiger paid off ex girlfriend to keep her mouth shut. He profiles some of the lesser known players like Frank Liklitter and Charles Howell but people who buy this book thinking they will learn more about Tiger will be disappointed. The current issue of Travel & Leisure Golf with Tiger on the cover is much more interesting.
5,A Great Read!,"I read this book straight through! ""Chasing Tiger"" is not yet another Tiger Woods biography, but an inside look at Tiger Woods through the eyes of other professional golfers, groupies, media people, caddies, etc..Curt Samspon tells a truthful, and sometimes shocking, account of what it's like to be on the tour with Tiger. This is a great book, not just for golf fans, but for anyone who is interested in more than what they read on the sports page. Curt Sampson has great style, and you should read this book."
5,Its The Rah Rah,"Outsidaz are Detroits finest. Eminem and Rah Digga my not be with them anymore but that doesnt hold them back. Outsidaz have mad skillz. There so good that I got a huge skrach on my CD so I had to go buy another Night Life EP. The only thing bad about this CD is that its a EP, I wish they had a full album. This ones only for Hip-Hop fans. Peace"
2,Not Good,"Outsidaz are not a brilliant group. This album consists of 6 boring tracks. 'Rush Ya Clique' however is a good song. Not just because of Eminems appearance, every rappers verse is good and the beats is good. I bought this album just for this one track assuming the rest would be good. But I was wrong. Don't buy it. Peace."
4,Underground hip hop at its best,"I first heard these guys with Eminem last summer. Pace Won is genious, the beats are catchy but the lyrics are the hard edge material you'd expect. Songs 1 and 2 are tight, Rah Digga's song is probably the only stupid track. Em flows nicely on #4. For the price you'd be stupid not to buy this, providing you like solid underground rap."
3,OUTSIDAZ,"FOR THE PRICE AND SOUND THE CD IS PRICED GREAT, SOME SONGS ARE LACKING THOUGH. RAH DIGGA'S TRACK IS HORRIBLE, EMINEMS VERSE COULD USE SOME WORK. THE BEATS MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF EFFORT ON THE GUEST RAPPERS PARTS. IN MY OPINION THE MAIN RAPPERS ON THIS CD RESEMBLE THE ARTIFACTS BUT MORE UPDATED.THE SHINING STAR ON THE CD IS ZEE, HIS FLOW REMINDS ME OF REDMAN (WHICH CAN'T BE BAD). SOME TRACKS ARE STRONG WHILE SOME SUFFER FROM A ""THUGGED OUT"" MINDSET.....BUT THE CD IS ONLY 7 BUCKS, CHECK IT OUT ANYWAY!"
4,Interesting and useful,"Very interesting book with several useful tips. It is focused in the ""digital darkroom"" processes and it becomes an interesting handbook while working with image processing software. Moreover, it gives some advices on photographic techniques specially oriented to digital cameras and their particular performance."
3,good basics,"It is a good basic book on digital photography. I found it o.k. with so many good books on digital photography, I found the information lacking, with the photographs somewhat dated..and the information too basic.. If you are just getting into digital photography, look at this one and others at this level of photography, then decide."
1,Poor quality,The practice paper looked like someone copied a bunch of pages and glued the edges. What a waste of money!
3,Shipping costs more than the pad!,"So I didn't buy it. The price of the practice pad is very reasonable, but when the cost to ship less than a 1 lb.-item exceeds the price of the item itself, I'm looking elsewhere."
1,What could be better?,"So, I ask you, what can be better then 1 practice pad? How about many! At .99 each how could you only buy one! I tell you what, normally I am a believer in you get what you pay for. So being so inexpensive I was quite curious as to what would be arriving in the mail. When they arrived I was impressed. I haven't counted all the pieces but I would estimate it to be 50 sheets per pad. Nicely spaced and well made. This product as served me well. As a practice pad this is the best product you could ever buy!*****EDIT*****Changed my review score from 5 to 1 because of the price jump. 9 dollars is way too much for this item. Looks like someone likes to rip off customers."
4,hunters cap birdhouse,i haven't opened it yet as it's a xmas gift for my daughter...so i can't write a review yet...after xmas i can do that as she will let me know how it is...thanks
4,Nice!,"When I opened the box I was pretty skeptical because the bra doesn't really have cups. When I tried the bra on all doubt went out the window, it looked great! I always wondered how celebrities were able to wear those low cut dresses without following out and I've used fashion tape before but this bra is an even better remedy. Very pleased!"
3,It's a bit pricey for plastic,"Not too much to add to the title review. The product arrived as scheduled, looked exactly as pictured, extremely easy to put together and will, hopefully, last a long time without looking weathered. But the fact that you've paid close to $130 bucks for what's really a simple piece of plastic furniture makes me wonder if I really overpaid for it."
5,Nice product,"The bar is very easy to put together, it took less then 5 minutes. It's very sturdy and looks nice."
3,I was dissappointed,"The photography is beautiful, but I was dissappointed that the images are about 90% of Arabians. Yes, they are gorgeous animals and are shown in stunning settings, but I was hoping for a wider range of images. I love all horses, but lean toward Quarter Horses and TB's as a preference. The other thing that really bugged me is that all of the photos of Arabs show them in show ready shape, except the mares and foals, groomed and clipped to perfection. The few shots there are of other breeds show them in the rough, beautiful to me, but coming across poorly compared to the other photos. I would highly recommend this CD to Arab fans, but tell others to look elsewhere."
3,Cheap Watch for Daily Use,"Good for daily use. Keeps accurate time, but there's no way to sync the day/date to change with the time -- the day/date changes as if it has a mind of its own."
3,Casio AW49HE,"This watch is ideal for sports. It is a casual watch that can be worn to the gym or to swimming. It is light, functional and sleek and good to wear especially on weekends."
4,Good watch,"I have about 20 watchesfrom this cheapie to ones costing several hundred dollars. I wear this everyday. It's best feature is the easily readable digital box. Other more expensive watches I own have a hard to read didital portion, so I can't wear them everyday. And since they are cheap enough, I just get a new one when the battery runs out or the band breaks. It's easy to set the alarm function, which I use throughout the day to remind me to take medications, make phone calls, etc. It's waterproof in the pool or shower, and keeps proper time."
5,just what i needed,"Im a patient transporter for a hospital and i always need to know what time it is. With the watch having an analog part, i can see what time it is between 1 and 12. But the watch also has a digital option where there are actually two time options, i use one for 1-12 time(if i dont feel like thinking too hard or am in a hurry) and the other for military time because in the medical field we cannot confuse AM or PM, thats just unproffessional!!!the watch lasted me about a year because the plastic hook thing broke but im definately going to get another one :)"
4,Virginia Curiosities,"As a Virginian and a traveler I find this little book informative, interesting and sort of like the ""underground books"" popular in lots of tourist destinations.I've lived in Virginia all my life and most of the details and oddities in the book I had never heard before. This book is a delight and a must for Virginians who love the Commonwealth also a must for the tourist to Virginia who would like to see things off the beaten track, things that add greatly to your visit. Enjoy!"
3,not a page turner,"I puchased this book based on customer rating. I enjoyed the first two book, but this third book is not as good as the first two. It was a slow reading. After I read about 250 pages, I had to give it up. The story is good actually, but for some reason I'm not sure why, it made a slow reading. I agree with Katie's review above thatreading this book was rather a chore than a pleasure."
3,Did this book really need to be writen?,"After reading the first two books of Kate Forsyth's this one was quite disappointing. It was very hard to get into, unlike the first two great books. It was more of a chore to get through then pleasure. I feel that Forsyth could have really ended the series at the second book, and fixed the loose ends there. The Cursed Towers had no real plot except for Isabeau and the child, and what happened with Iseult and her husband was completely confusing and not worth reading."
5,Wonderful!!,"I have read the whole Witches of Eileanan series and love it! I hope - wish - that Kate Forsyth would write another. I wish the series could just keep going and going. The characters are very intruging, and the plot of the books make them hard to put down! My compliments to Kate Forsyth."
5,The Cursed Towers,"I loved this book. Hell, I love the entire series of Eileanan books and highly suggest them to anyone who likes a good fantasy-type read. The characters are well-rounded, the magic makes sense... it's wonderful~"
5,Mag to the rescue!,"Three of these were wrapped under the Christmas tree for my husband when the power went out for a few hours. My husband began looking for flashlights, but was disappointed that we never have any decent ones around the house. I handed him an early present, and as he unwrapped it he announced, ""Finally! A good flashlight."" It's super bright and the beam can be adjusted to suit your needs. C batteries make the flashlight nice and slim...easy to hold."
1,the flashlight does not shine is it the bulb no!,Did I have instructions to make it work? As of now new batteries are useless for the MAGLITE S2C016 2-C!
5,"Good light, good size","Not too big, not too heavy, not too bright .. just right for any application (no filters included though). Good focus and light dispersement with an easy twist of the front (larger) part of the flashlight."
1,The Starlite Singers,"Who are the Starlite Singers? They are the artists that sing every song on all of the 5 CD's that come in this collection. I assumed that when amazon said various artists, that meant the original recording artists would be performing the songs but that is not the case. I guess the various artists are the various members of the Starlite Singers. It sounds like one really bad night at the karaoke bar. The CDS' are not worth the price."
5,Unbelievable musical quality,"A great introduction to the amazing musical talent of some of the best songwriters and vocalists in France. Yes, it is ""show tunes"", but truly magnificent musical quality. Incredible spanish guitarwork in ""Bohemien"" and the hit ""Belle"" is classic French music at its finest. I have listened to this album over 100 times and never tire of it. If you can understand the words, you will especially appreciaty the poetry. We as Americans need to wake up to the musical talent that exists in the rest of the world. Heavilly influenced by us but also including magnificent extensions particular to the local taste. This is a MUST GET album for anyone wishing to experience an eye-opening introduction to modern French music."
3,"A Long Game, but Not That Long","I was privileged to watch Koufax's last game in Atlanta Stadium. It was, as Leavy depicts, a long, rain-delayed game, played before a standing room only audience, but it was not over at 2 AM! My mom would have tarred and feathered my dad if he'd kept his two sons out that late. I was 13 at the time, and midnight is closer to the truth. But it was a marvelous experience that I will never forget!"
5,A hero for the ages,"Sandy Koufax is bigger than life. A person who comes along once in a generation if you are lucky. I spent my early preteens and teens (Koufax retired the summer before my senior year in high school) listening to all Dodger games on the radio with my dad. Especially Koufax games. His short but meteoric baseball career has been a major formative event in my life. Jane Leavy's book fleshes out the true hero he was and solidifies his stature in my being. Every seeming literary excess she uses pales in comparison to the actual experience we had of Koufax.I STRONGLY recommend every young person read this book to get a small insight of what a true hero and role model can be. In fact, I recommend all professional atheletes read it too for the same reason."
5,Review of Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy,"In a Lefty's Legacy the author, Jane Leavy tells the story of pro baseball player, Sandy Koufax. Not only does she tell of his great career but his life as a Jewish icon. Sandy Koufax revolutionized the game by helping create the modern free agent era and refusing to pitch on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. The author does a magnificent job of retelling each inning of Koufax's perfect game as well. This book is a must read for any baseball enthusiast."
5,You don't have to be a baseball fan . . .,"This is a great book. I couldn't put in down. The story of Sandy Koufax, as told in this account, is fascinating and illuminating. The way the author intertwined each inning of Koufax's 1965 perfect game with his life (one chapter on each inning of the game, the next chapter about a phase of his life)was brilliant. Whether or not you are a baseball fan should be irrelevant to the enjoyment of this book. The commentary about life in the '50s & '60s comes through clearly within the context of an extraordinary persona. Put this book at the top of your wish list."
5,"Very enjoyable book about Koufax, the master","I really enjoyed the book. It is well-written by Jan Leavy, a very talented author. Jan weaves some historical events into the story of Koufax. However, the book is about Sandy, and what a pitcher he was. One can only wonder what he would accomplish today (Major League Baseball is pathetic today, isn't it?), when pitchers' arms are not abused.I also enjoyed learning about Koufax as a person. He is an interesting man.If you buy the book, I do not believe you will be disappointed."
3,Wrong Title,"...I love baseball and enjoyed this book but it was way too ethnic. Jane Leavy depicts Bensonhurst, Brooklyn as Tel Aviv and Lafayette high school as a Yeshiva. A reader who was not familiar with that area in the 50's and 60's would get a very wrong impression. For every bagel place there were two pizza joints. Jewish culture was very much a part of Bensonhurst but the mafia ruled it...""Koufax"" is structured around being Jewish first and being a pitcher second. After reading this book I now know how many Jewish baseball cards there are. Sandy Koufax was a great pitcher and a good man but I didn't need to know if he ate pork. Aside from refusing to pitch on Yom Kippur, Sandy Koufax didn't seem to be all that religious. Good book but too ethnic."
3,An admiring biography in the raw,"This biography is also the history of the sport, of post-war Jewish culture, and of the broader culture of the early 1960's. It is an admiring bio that focuses on Koufax as a Jewish icon due to his excellent pitching prowess and his refusal to pitch a World Series game on Yom Kippur. Interwoven with the writer's coverage of his perfect game, she paints a lively portrait of an elusive man, and there's plenty of raw language, so let the reader beware."
1,Disjointed.,This book is very disjointed. It continuously moves from past to present even on the same page. I had to give up after 40 pages because I wasn't learning anything coherent about the subject.
3,Too Little for One So Great,"Leavy almost had it. Not Koufax's cooperation, that is clear, but the right approach to the man. Among the understandable and justifiably hero worship for her subject, she diminished him by writing far too much about a Jew who played baseball rather than a baseball player who happened to be Jewish (by heritage but, largely, not by religion). It's too bad that Koufax didn't intervene and (1) give us some insight into his greatness, and (2) squelch the unfortunate theme of the ""Big Jew."" He deserves better."
4,Captures an era as well as the man,This book is a fabulous read for the baseball fan. Leavy writes with poetic appreciation for the subtleties of Sandy Koufax's pitching abilty and her admiration for him is evident on every page.However this does not result in shallow hero worship . Instead we are brought back to a simpler time when baseball truly was the national pastime. A very enjoyable trip down memory lane for some and an exposition on one of the all time greats for those too young to remember.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I read this book a while ago and pretty much put it out of my mind until I saw that the author was getting press for her new Mantle bio, in which this book was cited as an ""achievement"". I was hoping for the definitive biography of one of baseball's great characters; I'm not sure what I ended up with. One other reviewer called it ""disjointed"", and I guess that sums it up. Try as I might, I could not finish this book. Koufax is a great subject and I didn't think it would be possible to write a bad biography about him, but I was wrong. I hope the Mantle book is better, but after reading the Koufax book I have low expectations."
2,Poor biography,"The author who is Jewish spent far too much time on Koufax being Jewish. As a biography it was poor. Jews may appreciate the book, but gentiles probably won't. The book didn't take you through enough of Sandy's life or his career as it seems to emphasize 1965. I usually like to read biographies rather than auto biographies, but I've read many auto bios which are better. The author may have been hampered by the fact that Sandy is so quiet and reserved that he makes a poor subject for a biography. There's a caption under a picture about Sandy being twice divorced, but only a few sentences about his first marriage. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
5,Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy,"Sandy Koufax: A Lefty&#65533;s Legacy, by Jane Leavy, was a great biography on Sandy Koufax. This book has a lot of information on Koufax. His perfect game and three no-hitters are included in much detail. It also includes his injuries and how he recovers. When he went to Synagogue instead of pitching game one of the 1966 World Series on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, it showed that he not only cared about baseball, but he also cared about his Judaism. Today his number is in the Hall of Fame and remembered as one of the best pitchers of all time."
3,Always a Strikeout With a Batter Possible,"Sandy was the most feared pitcher in the National League in the sixties and won three Cy Young awards. He was even better when he had a one run lead which was enough offense for him to win. The Dodgers sweep the Yankess in the world Series and Sandy set the World series strikeout record and made Mickey Mantle , Roger Maris,Tom Tresh,and Elston Howard look foolish as they all left the bat on their shoulders fooled by his pitches . Sandy had to retire early due to elbow problems and in the sixties as sport medicine was not as advanced as today. Pick this one up as Sandy is in the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the most dominant pitcher for five straight years in the sixites."
5,Great Book,Growing up in Brooklyn and Koufax was huge. Great book. It could have been a little longer. Will look for more.thanks Marty
4,An excellent and instructive tale.,"This is a fascinating story of real life in medicine and law, well told. However, it will leave you believing that the legal system is an terrible way to resolve questions about the quality of medical care. It is so vividly and accurately told that it also left me wondering whether the doctors and lawyers on either side of this heartbreaking conflict really cared what the truth was."
4,Not long enough,"As brilliant as The Convincer, but, at 33 minutes, there isn't enough of it. This album is so well produced, I, for one, would appreciate some longer pieces with more instrumental breaks. I''m grateful for the new release and am enjoying it, all the same."
4,Confessions of a Roué,"Given that Nick's 80s output (""Nick the Knife"", ""The Abominable Showman"") never got their due, it's refreshing to see the critical reverence he gets today. In this low(e)-key suite of stripped down productions, a world-weary lothario sings songs of love and loss. Still convincing."
5,Still One of the Best Writers Out There!,"With amazing ease and grace Nick continues to write songs that all people can relate to. ""At MY Age"" is as good a collection of songs as one could want. He is still one of the best songwriters around. Buy this and LISTEN."
4,"Nice, but can be improved","This Arthur math game is nice for first grade. However, not second grade or above. The math problems are too easy. For example, the most difficult calculation is still on the 1-digit base. For some more math calculation problems, I recommend a website: http://www.....com They have randomly generated worksheets, which provide your children enough practice to do math quickly.The rest of the game are pretty good. The sorting, hunting treasure parts are interesting. You get what you pay."
5,Excelent,"I would definately buy any product that I would need form this seller, It was as described and the delivery time was the best"
5,Looks good and works well,"This is pretty nice material BUT, you need to do it without being in a hurry. I used the paper backing, not the tint itself to serve as the windshield template. Use a spray water bottle with one drop of dish soap. One more thing, cover the dashboard with a large beach towel. Good luck!"
5,Insta Cling,Used this product to cover my alarm clock which had a too bright light. The insta cling helps to dim the light so its not so bright in my room at night.
4,"Good cable, though available cheaper at home improvement stores","This is a good security cable, lighter and more convenient than chains. It would be nice if the exterior coating was slicker so it would more easily pull through items you're securing, but that's a minor issue."
4,good case,"this case is very good and sturdy, but there are 2 things i dont like too much. 1 is that you cannot access the ""hold"" button at the top of the ipod without taking offthe case. 2 is that the screen is not protected, only the ipod that has color is protected to prevent scratching."
1,2 Thumbs Down,"In a nutshell, this book is nothing but a paper weight. The author is an amatuer, and it shows. Hundreds of books like this are published every year, this is no different from them, except it was written by a kid, and you can tell, it's like reading a 5th grade book report. Whoever signed this kid to a book deal should be fired.The tone in which the author writes is annoying as well, you can almost sense how full of himself he is.Nope, I can't recommend this book at this time. 0 stars (even though it says 1), try again."
5,Excellent Details,"This book is very detailed oriented, and includes information not available elsewhere. Includes excellent & informative information about UFO's."
4,Great documentation about the US coverup of UFOs.,"John has done a remarkable job in providing readers with documentation about how the US government covers up the truth about UFOs. John points out how Canada is more open to enquiries about UFOs than the US. (All countries are more open to providing information about UFOs than the US.)John must have the patience of Job to obtain as much information as he does from the FOIA.For believers and non belivers this is a must read.The facts are there. Believe :) :) A few gramatical errors but well worth reading.Clifford Clift, MUFON Director"
5,A good book,A good book that helps people train sled dogs. A must for a beginner. It helped me out a lot. Good for all.
5,Out of lnnocence,Out of Innocence is a real eye opener. The book draws you into the lives of the children and will not let you go. I emotionally experienced every trail and tribulation the children had and began to wonder if they would ever know any happiness. Dan Skelton portrayed the lives of countless children and the choices that can make or break them. This book will shock you and make you think. Way to go Dan!
5,Johnson Brothers dishes,The dishes were on my wish list. I received a gift card for Christmas and used that to buy them. They are just as represented and a nice addition to what I already have.
2,Severely Dated,"This book is severely dated. Though it does give basic security information, it will not enable you to pass the current exam, as the most recent OS covered in the guide is Windows 2000.Combine this with something more recent (good luck finding something) and you may be good."
2,Decent Product Overall,"Nuance's ScanSoft Paperport 11 is a welcome product to scanning and storing paper. However, there is a serious quirk that Nuance knows about, and that is the annoying water mark (product trial) that appears after documents are scanned. Nuance's answer (per support page) is for the user to delve into windows' registry and alter security permissions, then uninstall, system restart, re-install. I tried this several times and each time the problem reoccurred. There is a problem with this support approach: 1) first and foremost, Nuance should supply a patch or update to correct this problem, and 2) it is bad practice to expect users to spend hard earned money and wasteful time to correct a software problem that is both time consuming and unnecessary. So I give Nuance low marks for poor support."
5,Read this if Catholicism a la EWTN comes up short,"I was writing reviews of some other books and a notice on this book popped up on the page. I am surprised to see that it is still published. It is one of the books which helped me to reconnect with the Catholic tradition in 1990 after a time away as a born again fundamentalist. Hellwig awakened me to the sense that understanding Catholicism (or any tradition) is indeed a lifelong process. Catechesis is ongoing, at least in my experience, and this is very much unlike the idea, increasingly found in conventional Catholicism, that we somehow have managed to fully articulate the Christian vision."
2,Written for Academia?,"The author's audience seems to be those in academia. I found this book hard to read because the author did not spur or hold my interest. Her references require the reader to pick up another book to see what she is refering to - Such as the Chatechism of the Catholic Church or the Bible. You must have a good understanding of both books to understand her viewpiont. Honestly, I found this book to be quite dull.I will give the book the benefit of the doubt and I will re-read this book again another day. I admit, I came away with a couple of nuggets of informtaion that will be useful in my journey."
5,A Superb Book by a Superb Modern Day Theologian,"""Understanding Catholicism"" by Theologian Monika Hellwig is a must read for anyone who desires a truthful tutorial on what Roman Catholics believe. Monika Hellwig, who recently was called home by God, is recognized universally as one of the finest modern day Catholic theologians. Monika has the gift of writing about complex subjects in an easy to read style. Very often news accounts of Catholicism fail to provide a true insight of what practicing Catholics believe. Monika Hellwig's book sets the record straight in a highly readable manner."
3,Price doesn't make the product,"I had tried the oleo-relax serum with ok results, so I thought if I got the shampoo I may have better results. I have wavy hair, and I prefer to wear it straight, but when I dry it I get ""pouf"". So I thought this would be a help. My hair is fickle, some days this stuff works great, some days it's like I used some cheap regular shampoo. I am giving it a three because I would like for it to have offered my hair better control, and more moisture. It is average, and for the price, I probably won't buy it again."
2,Awful Results,Left my hair frizzier than ever. It's like the moisture has been sucked out. i bought all three parts of the set to make sure it'd work as advertised and the results were comparable to herbal essence. Regret significantly.
3,it's okay,"It works, but I prefer to use regular shampoos! If you want a style, you may want to stick to a relaxer, straighteners or blow dryers:)"
2,Unspectacular,I have chemically relaxed hair so I am always looking for the next new product to better strengthen or moisturize my hair. This product is supposed ot be smoothing but I didn't notice anything spectacular about it. Not work the super expensive price...I have tried the L'Oreal no sulfate sleek shampoo and THAT does what it markets.
3,Not all that glitters is gold,"I bought this thinking it would really liven my boring, somewhat frizzy Italian hair. But I haven't noticed any differences with this shampoo. Here are the cut-and-dry details: It smells lovely. The shampoo itself is thick and very heavy and does not lather much, so I find myself using a lot, esp snce I have long hair. Overall, not worth the money."
2,Keratase,"I use this Conditioner, but was not impressed w/ the shampoo. I Kiehl's shampoo, it is cheaper and loads better!"
3,Decent,I read all the reviews prior to purchasing this Shampoo and must admit that it is an average Shampoo. It's comparable to anything you can get from Target for a far better price.
1,do not bother,I have tried tons of expensive and non expensive shampoos and conditioners...this is not worth the money! It did not help with the freeze and it does not clean well...I am not even going to use the rest of the bottle!
2,Oh yea.,"I forgot to add, it didnt tangle my hair & im pretty sure my hair got bigger and poofier which i didnt even know was possible!!"
4,Good shampoo,"This shampoo sounded great in the description but like most other products I'm not sure I'm seeing much of a difference. I use it with the matching conditioner, but I think it's more the conditioner that is doing something. However, the combo does leave my hair much silkier than other shampoos (and I've tried a lot of professional products) so it certainly wasn't disappointing. Not sure if I'll get it again, I may still keep looking."
2,It's just Ok,I have been using this shampoo for about a month now and have not noticed any difference yet. It's either that this is a fake product or just not an effective one.
2,Patterns are not for everyone,"I purchased the book based on the (few) previous reviews, and primarily for patterns, but was disappointed. There is nothing that my teenage daughter would ever wear; no sweaters that my husband cared for; and only one sweater I might even want for myself. What may seem classic to some people is old-fashioned to others. The patterns are ""stodgy""-looking -- boxy with little fit. And as is unfortunately typical of many knitting patterns, the yardage for the projects is not given. Instead it gives the number of skeins of their brand of yarn. There are also several pages devoted to descriptions of the Green Mountain store and their yarns, but I didn't want to pay for advertisements and basic patterns that are found elsewhere. I have found more appealing patterns free on the internet, so check this out at your library first to see if these patterns suit you."
1,Urgent,"I purchased this knitting book because I like the yarn and the patterns. However, I received the first edition and when I went to The Green Mountain Spinnery website I discovered that there were corrections for this book. I printed off five pages of corrections for the first edition that included 21 projects in the book. The corrections were not included in my purchase. This is not consumer friendly at all. Buyer beware!!!"
2,Great pictures bul little else,"This is basically a pattern book pretending to be a literary and photo history of a commercial enterprise (the Green Mountain Spinnery). Loved the pictures--could do without the hype and self serving copy about the business. Also, the paterns are quite ordinary (there was one I liked--but it wasn't worth the cost of the book to get it) and dificult to use as I don't want to have to carry around the hard copy book everywhere I go. Your money will be better served on something else."
3,Crap production job,"For a guy who was known for extremely tight precision and control, I was surprised at how lousy the production values are on this disc. The cuts with Robert Palmer are especially awful.This disc doesn't to justice to the ""hardest working man in show business""."
2,Right Edition : Wrong year printed,"This book was alot nicer than I expected. The copy write is the wrong year I thought all I need to look for was the Author, name of the book, and the edition. WRONG its hard to follow along in class because the pages are different it takes a minute to find and catch up with the class if the teacher says page 79 it may be on page 139. All of the maps and charts are different and I don't have any of the short stories in my book that the proffessor likes to go over. I have to put in a some extra work if you don't mind I say get it's alot cheaper!"
2,REVOLUTIONARY NEW PRODUCT!,"Wow. Never buy another torch again! Portable light, without heat. This thing is _AMAZING_. BEWARE, it DOES eat batteries. ALSO, do not look directly into the fire, as it may temporarily blind you! MAG IS BACK WITH ANOTHER WINNER HERE!"
4,"Good Medical Use, Bad for Everything Else","Unless you're a nurse or a doctor I don't really recommend this light. It looks nice, and the pocket clip makes it perfect to clip to your coat, but the beam is extremely weak. I would only recommend this beam for pupil reactivity in the medical field.Pros:-Shockproof-Batteries included (2AAA)-Spare bulb in tailcap-Lanyard hole-Clip included-Adjustable Beam-Operates in candle modeCons:-Goes through batteries fast-Dim light, LEDs are better-Poor reflector, causes dark spots characteristic of all Maglites-Expensive at Amazon. Look for it elsewhere.-Candle mode is not great during power outages, it is very dimIf you are looking for a everyday light to carry in your pocket or purse, I recommend a new microlight, it is brighter, more efficient, and does not eat through batteries as fast."
5,This tool is necessary for a medical doctor.,In Japan this is the best item to examine pupil reflex for light and to see palate or tonsils.
3,"OK mini flashight, beam quality could be better","This flashlight is constructed to the same high standard as the other Maglites that I've used. However, the beam quality is not as good as my D and AA Maglites. It provides a good spot focus but the wide-angle beam is very non-uniform, which can make seeing where you are walking at night difficult. I've found the beam quality of the 2AA Maglite to be much superior for walking outside after dark."
5,Love the mini Mag,"I purchased this for my husband to carry with him in his truck. It's perfect as a ""traveler""...doesn't take up much space, yet gives BIG light. Great quality."
3,Its okay.,"I am not too impressed with this flashlight. I dont like the twisting the cap feature to turn it on and adjust the focus of the beam. So far while I have used it, it seems like it takes time to focus. Also the cap gets extremely lose. Who knows maybe after a while I will get used to it. Also 9 lumens is really low.I do like how the flashlight feels in the hand and the candlelight feature"
4,Very interesting and highly recommended,"When we ordered More Adventures of the Great Brain, I couldn't wait to get it. When I finally read it, I really loved it. It has ghost stories, swindling and all sorts of stuff that make Great Brain books the way they are."
5,The Great Brain,"My kids and grandkids enjoyed these books. I'm betting yours will too. There is a moral lesson, too, that our intelligence and cleverness must be used for good or they back-fire."
4,A fun picture of late 18th century mormon Utah,"I greatly enjoyed this Great Brain series, both when I was a kid and still today. This book, however, was probably my least favorite in the series. It really is probably not going to have a good impact on a child's moral character. That said, it is fun to read now, as it gives one great insights into what Utah was like 120 or so years ago. I also enjoy reading about the Great Brain's escapades, most of which are rather humerous. The Great Brain is almost the villian of this series as well as its hero. It is very often mentioned that he has a ""money loving heart,"" and Fitzgerald makes it rather clear that he does not usually approve of his brother's actions, while admiring his brains at the same time.Overall grade: B+"
1,So glad to find this book!,Book was in condition specified. I was very satisfied with my purchase. It arrived quickly.
4,To my surprise it actually works,"My mother-in-law has one of these, and to my surprise it actually works. I assumed it would jam and maul the photos.It shuffles the pictures sequentially, without damaging them or fingerprints. Next best thing to digital, as a gift for those who are not ready for digital photography, or who need another pictureframe. The frame is a bit plastic-y looking, but you don't notice that from a foot or more away. Good for those with lots of extra pictures they want to show."
4,All star country string-jazz session,"This CD reproduces the 1954 RCA ten-inch String Dustin', featuring country legends Chet Atkins, Homer Haynes, Jethro Burns and Jerry Byrd, and adds sides from 1956 that augment the all star lineup with jazz guitarist George Barnes. In retrospect, it's easy to think of Atkins picking jazz, but at the time it was still unusual for country artists to cross over. Those who know Homer & Jethro from their comedy records may be surprised by their top-notch guitar and mandolin playing. The material is a mix of pop and jazz, and the group (which included a changing line-up of session bassists, drummers and pianists, as well as fiddle player Dale Potter) gives most of these tunes a hillbilly twist. Haynes, Burns and Byrd each sing a few, but the real charm of these sessions is the high-spirited instrumental interplay. [2009 hyperbolium dot com]"
2,Not a book for serious naturalists,"The book is well organized and has the appearance of being handy, but is seriously incomplete. I'm a botanist, with research in the Sierra, and have tried several different resources in the field. Many plant species, common throughout the Sierra, have no mention in the book. If you happen across a plant that is covered by the book, the information is usually good, but what good is the book if most plants are not covered? Many photo-based field guides exclude the vast majority of species, because it's too costly and unfeasible to publish a book that thorough. However, a photo-based field guide should at least include all the most common species, which is where I believe this book falls short."
4,Wildflower guide identifies Sierran treasures,"Laird R. Blackwell's ""Wildflowers of the Sierra Nevada and the Central Valley"" (1999) is an excellent field guide to the area. The ""Quick Key"" organizes 357 thumbnails of flowers by elevation for quick reference, and the bulk of the guide is organized by family. Descriptions are adequate. The photos, overall, are good."
2,Important Plant Families Omitted,"Wildflowers of the Sierra Nevada and Central ValleyAs far as it goes, this book is very good. However, it omits any description of plants in the Primrose, Carrot, Borage, Orchid, Rose, Mallow, Heath, Evening Primrose, Buckwheat and Violet Families. There are important and common wildflowers in the Tahoe area in each of these Families. I keep hoping for a more-inclusive update."
1,Only need the fan,"The only reason I purchased this item is because it uses the same fan that my AOpen mini-pc has, and that went south. If I could find this fan at Fry's or someplace else, or if AOpen actually had a technical support staff that responded to inquiries, I wouldn't had to pay $35 for a $5 fan (the alternative being to toss a $1000 computer).My low rating for this item is entirely based on my opinion of the fan. I am already on my 3rd CPU fan for this computer (thus I have bought 2 disk enclosures), so I would suggest this fan is absolute junk."
4,Great product - but unable to format drive with OS X.,"I've bought this drive for an Airport Extreme router. The router and the drive cage fit perfectly. The look is good and the sound is quiet. My only problem was formatting the drive. Each time I atempted to format the drive with the Disk Utility, it would lock up. I end up formatting the drive with a Seagate external drive cage and moving it back into the Vantec. Don't know why. I imagine Vantec doesn't have as many Mac testers as PC ones."
4,Great item; difficult to install drive,"It's quite difficult to get the drive into the space provided and then get all the cables to lie flat enough to shut the case - it took me several tries. Once I accomplished this, however, it was an awesome piece of equipment. The best advice I can offer - BE PATIENT!!!"
4,Functions as expected.,"Works great. Seems a little louder than the NAS versions I have, but it may be the drive inside."
5,Great cd form a great band,"Despite some similarities with Liverpool fellows The Coral, The Zutons sounds so fresh and energizing to me that I cannot stop spinning the cd. They managed to successfully mix 70's influences such as Sly Stone and Talking Heads into a very personal formula. I haven't seen them perform live yet but I read positive reviews of their performance at Glastonbury festival. Highlights are the singles ""Pressure point"" and ""Remember me"". One of the best surprises of 2004, so far."
4,Baby Koala,"If you are looking for a cutsie cartoon character type stuffed animal, this is not the one for you. Hansa animals are known for realism - this is as close as you can get to what a real baby koala looks like. Very well made, excellent attention to detail, but can't go through the washing machine."
2,Are you wondering why they don't tell you who is singing on the cover?,"It's because they are below average & must have been cheap ""talent!"" If you look iside you see that the orchestra is the Prague philharmonic & sounds great. But the singers, ugh. The reviewers who say the vocals don't match the orchestrations are right. The choral group recorded in LA while the orchestra was recorded in Prague, 7 they don't sync well. The vocal selection is amazing (hence the 2nd star) -- Infant Holy Infant Lowly, Gloucester Wassail, songs that are hard to find. But, they pretty much ruin it w/ thin vocals, shrill tones & pitch issues. There is alsio little in the way of vocal dynamics. At least there's an accompaniment cd. If you want good choral music, save your money!"
5,Great collection!,All the classics and favorites of the holidays are here. My only complaint is that the performing artists are not listed for each track ... so you don't know who you are listening too.
3,Wish I'd read the reviews first,"Singers are painfully off pitch and several songs (like ""What Child is This?"") have faulty mixing with no melody...only the orchestra accompaniment...which actually might be an improvement."
1,YUKK!,I agree with some of the other reviewers on here who recognized the simply awful singing on this CD. I first heard selection from this CD on my Pandora Christmas station and kept giving them a thumbs down. How can you not hear how awful they are? They start pieces in one key and end in another. They sound like a bunch of amateurs who somehow got together and made a CD. Don't be fooled by the nice cover and snappy title. Save your money or buy a Christmas CD made by professionals. This is crap.
2,Are you kidding?,"While the musical arrangements are tolerably adequate and the orchestra is fair, this is some of the worst choral singing I've ever heard. They obviously have no concept of tuning and couldn't stay on pitch if their lives depended on it. I can't believe this is supposed to be a professional recording and the director didn't correct these glaring errors. I picked up this CD at an after-Christmas sale at 75% off, and I will forever mourn the loss of my $5.00. I guess it might suffice as a mediocre white elephant gift, but I pity whomever may be forced to listen to it. I suggest you not waste your money. If it's classical Christmas carols you want, search for more well-known and trustworthy music groups like the London Philharmonic and the Cambridge Singers."
2,Good Try but No Cigar!,"The musical tracks and the choir are frequently out of sync. Also,there is a bit of intonation about the choir, I believe it is in the male voices. Lots of songs here, but lacking punch. The 3rd CD contains only instrumental tracks for sing-alongs, if you're into that sort of thing.If you are looking for a great big bunch of songs, the Mormons are always a good bet."
5,The Holidays Never Sounded So Good!,"I loved the ""50 Most Loved Piano Classics,"" so I decided to try another ""50 Most Loved"" collection, this time the Christmas Carols album. These are classics in their own right as the arrangements and orchestrations are enchantingly beautiful and the choir vocals provide perfect point-counterpoint. I hate to admit this, but I'll probably still be listening to this CD long after Christmas is over. There's a cinematic soundtrack quality that I find haunting. Have a great holiday with this one!"
1,Horrible!,"If you have an affinity for pitch, don't waste your money purchasing this collection. The song choices are good, but the Choir is outstandingly horrific. The tone is consistently weak, thin, immature, and flat. This is not quality music."
4,Simple Christmas Songs - I like them sang ordinarily,"I was looking for some simply sang Christmas songs, just like those I heard from my hometown in a tiny Portuguese colony and my English Catholic school. But not too serious like those of a cathedral choir because I just wanted to play it at home. This one is my best match.-------------------------------5 hours later...I gave it a 5 stars at first. But after a while I placed the order and listen to the preview again. I didn't like it. It is giving me a headache T___T I guess the singing quality really isn't so great."
5,Very nice!,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that this is a very enjoyable CD of traditional carols. It contains a huge selection of songs. I was afraid that they might all sound the same, but to me, the orchestration and vocals are varied and well done. I bought this for Christmas, and it's one of my favorite new Christmas CDs in recent memory."
1,Poor quality light and mirror,"Very disappointing product. Light works erratically - sometimes it will turn on, sometimes not - after a few minutes, light will go off automatically. Strength of light is weak. Mirror image not as sharp and crisp as other 5X mirrors I've owned."
2,Not an enjoyable read..,"If you want a great sports romance try See Jane Score. This was not enjoyable. The characters were not likeable. Riley was a self absorbed weanie, and Sophie anal and uptight. There was no courtship, just two people who have nothing in common arguing about how they have nothing in common."
5,Save the best for last,This was the last and best book in the trilogy set of the sisters and it was great!! I am sad to know that there's not going to be another book in this set. A great book to read on the bunch!!!! You can't put it down until you know how it ends.
1,Stopped reading 60 pages in,"I've enjoyed other Carly Phillips books, but this one was awful. I wanted to like the characters, but just couldn't.I liked the idea of both characters (she uses order to prevent being hurt, he breaks rules to show that he can't be hurt). I stopped reading somewhere around page 65 and had started skimming before then. He was too much of an @ss; I just couldn't see what was supposed to be charming about him. And the author never showed us Sophie being competent and cool, only freaking out the whole time. Maybe if I had started with an earlier book in the series I'd have enjoyed this more."
4,Hot Item,"I have read the first two of this three book series, and this final book was not what I expected. The plot was very contemporary, dealing with political machinations and gay men. Family values are upheld by the author. I recommend this book."
5,Across the Universe,"Drew Barrymore, who is not someone I'd particularly credit with a great deal of intelligence, said something a few months ago in Rolling Stone that I think is close to profound. She said that if you have a question for the universe, put it out there and a John Lennon song will answer you back. As we all know, this is true, and if you ever need reminding, here's the book that will do it. It's the real insider's scoop - during these interviews you get the feeling that Lennon was really trying to set the record straight on quite a few things: and not by making nice all the time, either. Just by being frank and honest and egoless about his life.Here is a man who went through a lot of heartbreak and withstood it. Not only did he survive - he survived it without a lot of baggage. He came out the other end happy, and these interviews let you in on how he did it. Inevitably sad, since we know what's about to hit him, this book is ultimately very inspiring."
5,It's like sitting at John's table and conversing.,"This is not a literary classic,and I normaly do not read books about celebraties, but this paperback is just great. John Lennon goes through many of the Beatle songs and lets you know who did what, and what he thought about each song. Many little story's, and some verbal feedback on his solo album's. I cannot say I have/had a favorite Beatle, I liked all four of them and this book is just like sitting down with a Beatle and discussing the old days. It's not a Bio discussing the dark side of a rocker, or a sunny picture of a celebratie. It's just a Beatle on The Beatles. For a baby-boomer like myself it is pure nostalgia. It also re-kindles the old depressing feelings I had when he was murdered back in 1980, and I wonder why anyone would kill a Beatle."
5,Amazing,Read it and read it and read it and read it. He is a hero. She is incredible. It's an amazing document.
5,The Ultimate Compilation,"This is surely the best Clannad's collection. It offers us a precise cross-section of their already 30 years old work, including tracks from those first, pure folk albums, over very rare live recordings, eighties-pop, to nineties, in which they managed to keep their place at the throne of Irish folk, but ambiental and new age music as well. This compilation should stand at the end of every Clannad-fan's collection."
3,mobiBLU Cube DAH-1500i 1 GB Digital Audio Player Silver,"I like this item because it has an FM radio. Most MP3 players do not. It's small and compact which is good, but the cord could be longer, so it could be tucked into a pocket. When I'm walking fast it swings back and forth."
1,No Good,This little gem worked great the first time I hooked it up to my computer. When I got time to put on some more songs and recharge my computer would not even acknowledge the player. I could not add or remove music and then the player would not even turn on. My son and daughter both have different brands of players and they both work so I know it is not my computer. I sent it back and am in the process of looking for something else.
2,Can't get it to work,"I received this as a gift and was excited about getting it. However, there were no earphones included in the box and I tried to charge it and either it is defective or I have a bad cord. Since I did not order this myself I don't know what to do now. I think that I would like it if I could get it to work."
3,"Pretty basic, not a lot of insight.","I bought the book hoping to get some insights on making Judaism and morality part of my child's everyday life. The book didn't really get into that, but rather focused on some basic concepts of Jewish holiday observance and personal opinions from the authors. We got a lot more out ofSacred Parenting: Jewish Wisdom for Your Family's First Years, and have recommended that to friends who are planning to have children soon."
4,Solid tool for those who are learning while teaching,"I have read most of this author's books, and I have found all to be quite helpful. Good guidelines for choosing camps, schools, and shuls."
5,"Outstanding for 17"" x 22"" large format prints","I bought this printer because I wanted to print 17"" x 22"" genealogy charts in color. I also wanted pigment-based inks because they are much more fade resistant than dye-based inks. The 3800 has exceeded all my expectations. Setup was easy and the quality of photos printed on Epson media is superb. I'm delighted with the product!"
3,"Epson owns your printer, even after you buy it","Don't buy the optional ColorBurst RIP software. There's nothing wrong with the software, except that it only works with Epson papers. You can never add another paper to the list. The RIP is also hard to use and loves to print on absurd locations on the paper, even when you select ""center.""The printer itself is nice, and my one call to Epson support was handled well by a gentleman who was sympathetic to the castrated-RIP issue.Be prepared to spend at least $[...] more for a full-fledged RIP."
4,Much to like but one setup challenge,"I just bought the printer but had problems setting it up. My first prints (on Epson Ultra Premium Luster Paper) came out smudged and had rows of little pin pricks on them. I had to call Technical Support (very good - especially that Epson has a special service for professional printers) to get talked through widening the platen gap. I have not yet found a permanent way to widen the gap - it starts out at standard width whenever I turn on the printer.Colors and sharpness are very good. It's not very fast, but then other large format printers are probably slow too when printing an 11x14 at 1400 dpi."
4,Photographers preference.,"I have had an Stylus Pro 2400 for the past 2 years before this up-grade to a Stylus pro 3800. The fact that I can produce image sizes of 16x20 (largest with this printer is 17x22) I have found no manufacturer that offers 16x20 papers as yet. I am extremely happy with the results of my 17x22 enlargements and with the menu options in the printer window. It is however, necessary to read the manual...especially on the feed options and how to get the papers to feed. Some of the instructions are a little vague and require familiarity with earlier Epson printing techniques. The ICC paper profiles become a little easier to determine with use."
5,Exceeded my Expectations,This printer met and exceeded my expectations. I had read several reviews from others but was surprised to see how easy it was to use such a powerful tool. If you have properly calibrated your monitor and this printer your will produce a exceptional quality prints.
2,Awful support,"Printer arrived less than two weeks ago, and a magnet that holds the ""front door"" closed came unglued, causing it to drop open and stay open. I called Epson service and was told to take it to the service dealer (150 miles away) or ship it back for a serviced unit. You'd think Epson could send a new part, some glue, or some solution that would save money at a time when everyone is looking to cut costs. Boxing, shipping and waiting were not pleasant solutions. No, said the ""service"" person, ""this is simply procedure. There's nothing else we can do."" I asked to speak to his supervisor and was told that would not be possible. I thought Epson corporate leadership might like to know their system is broken, but they force all contact back through the product groups and ultimately one of these unhelpful service people. BEWARE. It's a great printer, but if you have the slightest thing wrong, the support is AWFUL and OBSTINATE. They will not budge."
1,expensive printing and black switching,"Owned this printer for ~2 years. Cost ~$450 to replace ink each time. this was ~$1800 for me and i don't print that much. Also, the blacks need to swap from photo to text and will dump black ink out at each switch into an expensive capture cartridge that you need to replace as well. the cost of the ink is high compared to other printers and the photos were good, but not spectacular. save yourself some money if you have to have an inkjet and get the next size up as it doesn't do the black ink dumping dance and it has larger ink cartridges/ lower cost per ml ink. really save yourself some money and get a good color laser printer. The operating cost for me have been far lower and the pictures are fine for most applications."
3,Not sure it's that good with Velvet Fine Art,Working with Velvet Fine Art and using Colormunki printer calibration. I fine that the printer doesn't seem to do well working in moderate F stop changes to the darker side in the photo. An example is an antique car under a carport at a old gas station. Gas station is fine but the car in the shade has muddled color? My R1800 seem to handle these changes fine. My advice is to test print on 8X10 paper before you jump to the 17X22 stuff. There seems to be an F stop tipping point where the printer gets it right and where it doesn't..haven't figured it out yet.Another point is the rear feed is really a pain! 3-4 times to get it to feed right before the printer says the alignment is right..
1,EPSON 3800 PRO BAD NEWS!!!!!!!!!!,My wife purchased the Epson 3800 Pro Printer as a Christmas Present. I printed less than 10 photos and got an error message. The message said to contact the Service Repair Center which is only open from 6-6 M-F Pacific time. Not the level of Customer Service or Performance that I expected for the price of the printer.The quality of the few prints was excellent.
5,BEST EPSON UNDER $2000,"I've had this printer for over 9 months now with very very heavy usage and it works flawlessly. If you only use epson ink and paper designed for inkjet printers (not just epson media, but also things like Illford, Hahnemuhle, Moab) with the downloaded ICC profiles off of their respective web sites you'll get stunning results. I've printed maybe 5k pages out of this thing (some full bleed solid browns on 17x22) and have only replaced the light light black cartridge so far. The money you save on ink versus other printers is a selling point by itself. I upgraded from a 1280 and have used the 1800 and 2400 but this is by far the best and easiest printer to use. No more wrestling with paper settings or paper sizes... it just works."
5,"The Whole Ball of Wax, Metaphysically Speaking","A book no respectable domicile should be without! An extremely comprehensive collection of readings, spanning the gamut of human thought. Philosophers from Descartes to Locke to Baier write on everything from The Self, ethics and the existance of god, to and anarchy and rights and goods. Would make an excellent for any intro. to Philosophy class."
3,Excellent Account of this Conflict,"I had heard of this bloody war, but didn't know much about it. In this 48-page softbound book, there are intriguing photos, diagrams and accounts of France's war in one of its colonies in the 1950's and 60's.I had a much better understanding of this war and the outcome of French-Arab relations once it was over. It is a definitive history of the French-Algerian war, and I recommend it highly."
5,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL,GUESS HWO'S BACK IN THA MUTHAPHUCCK!N HOUSE?!?!?!???!!!THIS INSTRUMENTALS ROCKS!!!BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!
4,I never thought I'd Use it this much,"I got one of these for Christmas, and it's amazing how often it's used. It's extremely handy, and the quality of its tools is surprisingly high. It is incredibly sharp, and its locking mechanism makes it very safe to use. I hardly know that I am wearing it when its in its pouch. A must for any walk in the woods!"
5,A clear look at the society of the first century.,"Meeks takes a look at the first Christians from a perspective rarely found in typical Christian Bible dictionaries, encyclopedias, and commentaries. The strength of this work lies in the fact that Meeks is specifically unveiling the social customs and mores of the first century. Especially helpful are his discussions on the living and working conditions of the first Christians.Since we are nearly 2000 years removed from the social context on the early church, a book such as this helps us to see what we have been missing."
2,I did not like it...,"I did not like this book. The author seems full of himself. He uses unnecessary haughty language, and does not fully string out some of his thoughts. There is something to value in this book and that is the speculative evidences he gives for the socio-historical world of Paul's ministry, but the trouble is to get to that you have to wade through countless sections of the authors rants against the NT Canon, inspiration, and authorship."
2,The old Myth is mything,"Since Robert Asprin teamed up with Jodie Lynn Nye, the stories have really taken a hit. Asprin's stuff was light-hearted and fast-moving - these are drawn out and plodding. Asprin included modern concepts like credit cards, computers, and novelty items (Rubber Doggie Doodle with Realistic Life-Like Aroma That Actually Sticks to Your Hands!) as props, just enough to get some fun and a bit of satire out of them; Nye appears to want to build an entire story around them and milk them for every nuance - in this case, computers and televisions. C'mon, a recitation of the exact win/loss ratio of someone playing computer solitaire? Boring! Sadly, I got a third of the way into this book and found myself wishing that they'd hurry up and just get it over with."
4,It took 15 years and a co-author...,"..but we finally have a really good Myth book!This is the Myth I remember! Snappy pacing, whimsical adventure, funny action scenes! At last!I'm not sure how much credit should go to Robert Aspirin, but considering that he's said in the past that when he co-authors a book he puts his name on the cover and doesn't add a whole lot else and that this book is quantum leaps ahead of the last SIX VOLUMES, I think the lion's share of the credit should go to Jody Lynn Nye. She has done a fantastic job of staying true to the spirit of the Myth books and the characters while making them fun to read again.Everything here clicks. The quotes, the characters, the plot. It's like a visit to an old friend who was ill, but has now recovered. It's great to see them again without having to ask them if there's something wrong."
4,Exceeded Expectations,This book is unexpectedly practical and full of useful information. I could hardly put it down the first day I received it!
4,Montie Montana - Not Without My Horse!,"An excellent view of the life of an American showman. Loaded with photographs from 1910 (when Montie was born) through 80+ years of show business. I've looked at those photographs over and over thinking about how times were back in the 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's ... what a change in our history from horse & buggy to space exploration and computers. A great time in history, and a great showman's life. Entertaining!"
2,poor quality,"I bought this book for my mother because she knew Monty from years ago. This was a replacement for the same book I bought her several years ago. The first book fell apart and unfortunately, the first time my mother opened the new book it did the same thing....the binding fell apart and the pages came out. What a disappointment!"
3,it was ok,"I felt that Nikki was very well rounded, but you were given no clue on Harper's thoughts. Of course, he was very reserved and calculating, but come on! You need to at least know some of his thoughts and feelings. There was action, and some normal things that happened, but all in all kind of cliche. You were not given any clue on what he thought of Nikki herself as a person. At the end, you knew he cared, but during the book it just got so where you didn't expect him to ever lose his coolness. Which, I might add, he never really did except for a gradual felling of caring for her in the VERY end. So it was OK, but not my very favorite."
3,Cry Wolf,"I have to agree with both the other reviewers it was ok yet entertaining I do like this author she tends to write a different kind romance novel.Big bad wolfLike the skilled predator of the hunt, Harper Beaumont cornered Nikki Ashton and offered her the biggest opportunity of her career. While his domineering manner left her cold, his demanding kiss warmed her considerably.Nikki knew Harper was the only man who could unleash her passionate nature. Unfortunately, he saw her as a gentle lamb to be protected--not as a partner who could match his fierce passion... ."
5,don't judge and album by the sound,"sound quality - not so good. everything else about this disc -excellent. actually the sound makes it sound like getting your hands on a blues album, getting it down to your old turntable, and playing it trying to pick up any thing you can from it. he is definitely magic."
1,"Great show,Bad sound","Magic Sam was magic.One of the greatest blues talents ever.This was one hell of a show,great guitar and great vocals.The setlist was also very good.The only problem is the sound,it's really bad.Save your money and buy one of his studio albums.I suggest either West side soul or Black magic.You won't be sorry."
5,Best resource guide for young people in school--EXCELLENT!,"As an English teacher, this is the best resource guide for young people in high school and college. I recommend this resource for anyone who must write a variety of compositions. It includes both APA and MLA styles as well as other helpful information."
4,dont want them to fix it,This book is creative and homurous. Two children accidentally break their mom's favorite plate and then two wacky fixit guys show up. In an attempt to fix one thing they break something else and eventually end up breaking the whole house. Read on to find out how it ends when mom shows up.
2,Well written but difficult to sympathize with,"All the white men in the Congo were lonely, and to satisfy their loneliness, they apparently have a harem of African women. Mawa was the most desirable of these women and everyone fought to have her. Mawa only wanted one thing, to protect her son and would do anything to keep him. Well written, but not a favorite of mine. I couldn't understand why everyone wanted Mawa so badly. I couldn't understand why every man seemed to throw away everything to be with her. Mawa's devotion to her son was admirable, but as a woman reading this, I found that her only admirable quality. It is cool that one of the few other people who own this is Carl Sandburg."
3,1970s Period Piece,"I purchased Set 1 of the Van der Valk mysteries because I enjoyed reading Nicholas Freeling's books on which they are based. Visually and stylistically, the video series is a trip back to Amsterdam in the 1970s (a nostalgic fun thing) and back to 1970s-style moviemaking (talking heads - not so much fun). As in the books, the plots and characters are realistically ambiguous, so viewers looking for neatly wrapped-up endings may be frustrated. I'm not sorry I purchased Set 1, but I probably will not purchase Set 2."
2,Nothing to do with the Netherlands.,"Dated. It is simply not interesting, well acted, well filmed. Perhaps 40 years ago it would have been OK but not today."
2,Over acted silliness ruins Nicolas Freeling's mysteries,"Barry Foster throws himself around the screen over-acting, drinking, smoking, eating, and generally stomping his way through the lead. Too Bad they couldn't have hired a better actor. Nicholas Freelings mysteries were a joy to read. On the strength of that and several positive reviews (cult classic etc) I bought the first set. I certainly will not buy the second set and wish I could return the first."
2,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,My husband and I watch a lot of the Bristish movies but neither one of us cared for this one and will not be buying anymore.
5,Very User Friendly and Comfortable,"I searched for a very long time in stores and online for the perfect double stroller. My daughter is very tall for 2 1/2 and did not fit comfortably in the double strollers that were long. Also the cheaper strollers were very small as well and I was concerned with my newborn. This stroller fits my two children very comfortably and I have even put the car carrier in the stroller with no concerns. There is room to grow. It is easy to open and close. It is big but no overly big for a double stroller and I do fit through every doorway. It is difficult to fit down aisles when shopping but any stroller is difficult. It came with lots of accessories that I will use and there is room under the stoller for stuff. My husband and I are tall and it is easy for us to push, I even speed walk with it at the park with no problem (Probably wouldn't jog). Worth every penny. You get what you pay for!"
2,Too many character point of views.,"In this book about an alternate timeline where the US and Confederacy choose opposite sides during the Great War, everybody has a story to tell, and Turtledove spends the entire book doing just that. It's impossible to remember who the characters are because there are so many of them and the story switches to a different character's point of view after every couple of pages. It would have been far superior to limit this book to 3 seperate character's stories. Then the reader would be able to relate to the character and follow their stories easier.This book was really a dissapointment considering it contains two of my favorite subjects, alternate timelines and WWI."
2,suffers greatly from the style,"There is no doubt that Turtledove has thought through all of the details of his work in this alternately history story. The major issue I take with it is how he chooses to tell the story.Rather than one viewpoint character, or even a handful, the reader is bounced to a different person for each scene with few repeats. In fact, his few ""main"" characters could be argued to have less page time than most other novel's minor ones. For me, it is a slow, plodding process of being introduced to someone new every chapter, and after a while you get wise to the fact that you're probably not going to see them again. All the effort quickly struck me as wasted, and I had to stop about a third of the way through the book.The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because I feel that Turtledove is a gifted writer, and an exceptional wordsmith, but his choice of how to convey the narrative cripples the story beyond rescue for me."
1,Premise spoiled by no denouement & boring characters.,"This book is part of an un-announced seriel and so it does not reach any resolution, a fact which I found annoying. Its one thing to buy a book knowing it is book 1 of a trilogy, and quite another to buy a book and not find out is part of a serial until about 3 quarters of the way through the book, when nothing of interest appears to be happening. The book lacks any focus on the grand picture, concentrating instead on ""slice of life"" glipses of uninteresting characters. The book's premise is interesting but the execution is terrible."
2,Too much exposition in what should be character conversation,"I agree that not enough historical figures appear in this book, too many ordinary Joes and Janes. The fun in alternative history is to show how the Great Ones may have risen anyway. The other problem: Too mcuh exposition in dialogue, too many times, characters who would be talking shop or talking about girls instead go into longwinded historical summaries. Makes the dialogue slow going, Harry T. should shoehorn the background in more realistically. He has some great concepts, but I wish he'd make these two changes!"
4,"Good Read, lacking some backround and thinking","This book is mostly good execept Russian presence is lacking,(It was a major player early on)and the lack of information on Austria-Hungray,the Ottoman Empire,Italy(the other members of the German Alliance system), and Spain(Spainish-American war ends Spanish empire). Also I feel it is a poor choice to give Haiwii to the British empire(Why? CSA in Bahja no major trade options cotton no longer an interest, too many USA ships) and not talk about Alaska."
4,"An excellent book, but not his best.","It's hypocritical for me to simultaneously rush out to buy every Turtledove book (in hardcover yet) when it comes out, and to also suggest that he's spread too thin writing too many books, but I think that's the case. ""American Front"" is an excellent book, one that would do credit to most any writer, but it's not up to Turtledove's high standards. (Note to Publishers: pay him more money so he can spend more time on each book.) This said, I enjoyed the book and read it straight through. It's a first-rate book; it's just that I know he could do better."
3,"A great idea, but Turtledove seems bored with his style.","I really enjoyed How Few Remain, even if it pains me to even think about a Southern victory in the Civil War.(But I enjoyed the relationship between Longstreet and Jackson, he really captured their personalities.) Here Turtledove seems to lose interest in his characters and in the story itself about 150 pages in. There a few interesting characters on both sides, but no one you can really 'root' for to survive and win. That said, I can't wait to see how he writes himself out of the complexities he has created in this volume. But, as a previous reviewer has stated, I will wait for the paperback."
2,Far below Turtledove's previous standard,"World War I style trench warfare alternated horrifying danger with stupifying boredom, all in squalid living conditions. Unfortunately, the first book in Turtledove's new great war series is just boring. The interweaving of plausibly developed historical figures with fictional characters which was such a delightful part of his Worldwar series and his two Civil War books is mostly absent and he doesn't juggle the multiple plotlines as adeptly as in prior works. Sadly, the book reads like a plodding pot-boiler. Hope springs eternal, so I'll probably finish reading the series.....but I'll wait for the paperback version for the next volume!"
4,a great read for fans of alternate history,"Please note, read How Few Remain before reading this, that book sets the stage for this one. The great war of 1914 pitted nations and alliances against each other in a level of combat never before seen. As any history student knows, the United States entered the war in 1917 and essentialy ended it by providing a decisive edge in men and material to the allies. But, what if it didn't? What if during the civil war,the Confederate states had managed to hold on and deny the north the victories it needed to keep Britain and France out of the war? How would the great war of 1914 turn out if there were a United States embittered and angry over two losses it had suffered against a Confederacy and it's military allies? The events of WW 1 set the stage for the rest of the century. Harry Turtledove has begun an interesting series which asks, what if things were different?"
4,"Good book, but ""How Few Remain"" was better!","Overall, I loved the book. The books only problem was how all of the focus was on the Eastern Theater of the War (Big Lick a.k.a. Roanoke, PA, MD, Ontario, Quebec, KY, Seqouia) with the execptions of Sonora at the begining and Western Canada near Winnipeg. There was also hardly any focus on real historical characters. Pershing is mentioned, but never shown. The young George S. Patton, is he fighting for the US or CS, I'm also hoping to see Alvin C. York in a future book. I also think it would be interesting to bring a German to America to observe the war like Col. Von Schliefen in ""How Few..."". Otherwise, it was a good book. The good thing about it, is I don't know who to favor because both countries are bad guys. The US does not treat blacks much better than the CS. I'm a southerner, but the CSA isn't that great either. I can't cheer for Canada because I'm from the USA, or CSA in Turtledove's world. Can't wait to read ""Walk in Hell"" though."
4,Incredibly intriguing look at the fragility of the U.S,Good Book about the Second war between the states
4,The Great War American Front,The possibility of the South winning the Civil War was so real that it warrents a book like this to show some of the possibilities of what could have happened. Turtledove does a wonderful job of guideing the reader through an interesting plot. The only aspect of the story that I wanted more of was the interactions with the European powers. If turtledove had written them into the story more this book would have been worthy of five stars.
4,"War From The Trenches, War From The Airplanes","Turtledove's fans has come to expect the kind of writing The World War introduces. Thank you, Harry, you didn't let us down once again!!! The unmatched ability of the author to portray a continent-wide conflict from the point of view of ordinary and not-so-ordinary people in their everyday lives - the so-called view from the trenches - is what makes this book a must-read, along with Guns of the South, How Few Remains, and the Worldwar series. My only complaint is that the pace of this book is a little too fast, although I understand that, unlike Guns of the South, this is a multi-book engagement and therefore should not drag."
3,"Another excellent read from Turtledove, but incomplete.","H. Turtledove is the master of alternate history novels and this novel is no exception. However, before you read it, realize that it is another TOO LONG 4-part series. Unless you have 3-4 years to spare waiting for all the others to come out, don't start it.The publisher should be chastised for not mentioning on the cover that this is not a complete novel, just one quarter of one."
3,This series is getting more tired all the time...,"I enjoyed ""Guns of the South"" for its novelty, and ""How Few Remain"" likewise, but this book, a sequel to ""How Few..."" bogs down pretty quickly. Too many little storylines, too many characters and too few speculations about historical figures. Where is Abraham Lincoln? Is he still alive and if so, what does he think of the impact of his writings in both the USA and the CSA? Teddy Roosevelt shows up in the trenches once or twice, but I wish the book stayed with him for a few chapters. How is he living now, if the White House is shuttered up? How does the government function? For that matter, what about Woodrow Wilson's daily life in the CSA? And how does the war progress in Europe, if no Americans are fighting there? I just couldn't get interested enough in the lives of the ordinary Joe characters to really enjoy this book. Oh, I'll probably read the next one, but I hope it's more like ""How Few..."" and less like ""American Front""."
2,Disapointing,"I really tried to get into this book, but gave up after about 200 pages of jumping around from one underdeveloped character to another. The problem is that there are many potentially excellent characters, whom I would have loved to read more about. By the time one character sparked my interest though, the book jumped to another location, with a new character to become aquainted with.I like the concept of the series and would like to see read more stories like this, but instead of having to keep up with so many characters in one novel, why not just spread them out into seperate novels alltogether?..."
2,Just a war story,"Turtledove has written some good stuff (Guns of the South, How Few Remain), but this is just a war story about a war that never was, for the most part.What makes alternate history special for me is the chance to understand real history better, and what might have been had things turned out differently. Despite the title and hype, there isn't much of that here. Instead, Turtledove follows a bunch of fairly ordinary folks through long and not particularly compelling narratives.Very disappointing, but then The Two Georges, another letdown, should have warned me. Turtledove has skill at characterization and can write a crackerjack book when he wants to, but it seems that now he is just riding the crest of popularity and churning them out.Be warned, folks, and give this one a pass. You want good alternate history?:Ward Moore, Bring the JubileeH. Beam Piper, Lord Kalvan of OtherwhenRobert Harris, Fatherland"
3,"Ok Book,But not one I would suggest to someone else","The author had a alot of neat ideas for an alternative way the United States would have been if the civil war had been a draw.But the amount of characters that this book revolves around is unbelievable.It took me till I was 3/5 the way through this book before I would remember the next group of characters he would write about.And instead of hearing about just the yankee's up north,it was 95% of the time the ""damnyankee's""(monotonous).Also about 50 pages from the end it starts becoming obvious that the story is not going to end with this book.It just doesn,t have good closure for some of the characters.Maybe it does with the next book.Overall if your into alternate history its not a bad book.But be prepared to be lost or keep notes through this book."
2,Yamabushi's mini reviews XXII,"I could cut and paste my `Into the Darkness' review here, only American Front lacks either aliens or magic too make it the least bit interesting. There's more then a few vivid descriptions of a horse and wagon stuck in a muddy road in here, I think the plots in one of those wagons."
1,somewhere out in left field,"The book is poor as literature. Alternate histories are good because they give us things to think about, but in order to be good it has to be based in some truth. It is my opinion that the South was missrepresented in this novel. I mean, blacks become communist? That's a bit extreem. I did like the concept of the book though and I do agree with Turtledove that if the South had won Lincoln's War they would have sided with the allies. Weather the North would have gone with the Central Powers is food for thought. I give this book 1 star for idea only. The concept is good even if the basis of the story is very poor."
3,A good read,"You must understand that when you read this book, you have to be engaged not only in the characters but the whole scheme of things in this version of WWI. Red Fear, the oppresion of blacks in the south, and the world struggling with a new type of warfare play prominent roles in this book. I commend Turtledove for his treatment of these topics. This is how things could have been.However, he doesn't quite give the reader full characters to root for or against. They come off a bit flat and a bit stereotypical. However, they fulfill their roles well. This is a must read in my mind, and I hope that you can suspend disbelief just long enough to think about what could have been."
5,Outstanding!,"Turtledove has written an engrossing, devouring tale of an alternate history. This series has (so far) been far superior to his other works such as ""How Few Remain"" because most of the characters are fictional or mostly fictional so he is much less limited in character development. Of course, there are many (too many?) subplots, the depth of detail and breadth of vision of Turtledove in this series is remarkable. The most surprising aspect of this series to date has been his sense of humor and sublety. For example, 3-Finger Mordecai Brown makes a subtle cameo appearance, and (not to give too much away), when the AMERICANS bomb Pearl Harbor, a casually tossed in line about ""this day will live in infamy"" is too rich to pass up. Outstanding."
2,Doesn't live up to expectations,"How Few Remain was much better and really gave me high expectations for this novel. Although Turtledove does a great job with the setting, he tries to develop too many characters. Unlike Guns of the South he does not use historical figures centrally. Teddy Roosevelt is President of the US in 1914, a major character in How Few Remain, but not here."
2,Just Ok Tool,"Ok, I am not a professional floor install, but I do consider myself to have better than average skills in the DIY arena. The product arrived on time in a nice carrying case. However I found that neither of the two interchangeable base plates worked well for my flooring. One set the nail in the top of the flooring, the other set it well out on the tongue. After some fiddling I ended up using the thinner base plate with some shims. This seem to get the nail set in the correct place on the flooring. The biggest problem now is that the nailer frequently marrs the edge of the flooring, causing a noticeable blemish that has to be rubbed out.I am willing to concede that this may be due to my custom shims, and I have to admit this is the first floor nailer that I have used. It could be that my shims are causing the blemish, so take this review with a grain of salt. I have to say though that I cannot imagine flooring with out a pneumatic gun, I'm just not sure this is the best one for the job."
3,Not up to snuff for Lamar,"I bought this book and while the photos are, in many cases spectacular, the book itself does not match the previous work by the author. Granted, you get to see pictures of some extremely rare and little-known herps. But, that just whets the appetite for more; especially a bit of text for edification, something which Lamar is perfectly capable of doing. I had hoped this would be on a par with the author's work in the ""Venomous Reptiles of Latin America"" but it does not match the scope of that monumental work. Alas, this is exactly what it purports to be, an expensive albeit very well done book of pictures. It is worth having if you have money to spare and wish to fill your shelves."
3,"Cute, but thin","I got these curtains to match the theme of our nursery. Though they are cute (because they match) I am a little disappointed in the material. The curtains are very thin, and do nothing to keep out the light. The material wrinkles very easily. These curtains are more for looks as opposed to functional. I need to get some blinds for the windows so the baby can take a nap in a darkened room. I still like the curtains. I was just hoping that they would be thicker."
3,"cute, if it fits","Bought this watch to wear walking, it was very eye-catching and (I thought) worth the money, but it didn't fit! The band was not as flexible as I expected, and it did not fit comfortably on my wrist. I'd say it runs small, so if you have a larger wrist, I wouldn't reccomend. Otherwise, it is very cute."
2,Not a runners watch,"Was disappointed to find the size to be way off and this watch does not fit well as moves around arm. I actually changed to a smaller version.But worse is that Nike have major flaw with the stopwatch as once it reaches 100 minutes, it actually STOPS. Does not start again at 1 min as you would expect. So if you looking to run any half marathons dont bother with this one.I do like the night light and the cool variety of colours available make it pretty cute and funky."
3,Loaded Stretching: The Russian Technique for Instant Extra Strength DVD,"Expected a program to follow not bits and tips on loaded stretching. And ''Yes"" Mr Tsatsulin is overdoing it with the Commarade! to a degree that it is funny"
5,This one is a gem - fantastic,"Once in a while along comes a sex manual that is great, wonderful, fantastic and informative all wrapped up into one book. This is it. It tells you everything you ever wanted to know about sex but were too dumb to ask. It is funny, tongue in cheek, and written with a wisp of humor. It is goofy, and yet wonderfully and directly on the mark. I cannot say enough for this bok. It is totally informative, in all areas of sex. It is not over-long, and n=does not dwell on the boring but contstantly keeps your interest. I enjoyed it from cover to cover. I could not put it down. It is written in everyday language and then some. It tells it like it is, and reminds us all that there is always smething in sex that we do not know and are glad to learn. Thank you to the author and illustrator for writing a wonderful book for all. Totally informative. A must forall interested in learning about sex from the bottom up. A must for anyone trying to teach teen agers correctly about sex."
4,everybody should read this book.,"i have read many books on this and related topics, and this is the most comprehensive guide i have seen so far. there were many items that i had never read about before. the only problem was that there were times when it was a bit repetitive, i kept thinking i had read things in previous chapters.everybody who does, knows, wants to know, or wants to do anything sexual should read this book. great book. buy it or borrow it, but READ it."
5,Wonderful Book - Buy It!,"This is a wonderfully sexy book that is perfect to read with a partner! I bought it for a long car trip I took with my girlfriend. While she was driving I read some of the stories to her and she loved it not just because it totally turned her on but because she thought it was very sweet and romantic that I would read to her these stories. Also, wow that turned out to be one hell of a hot car ride - amazing we didn't have an accident (you have NO idea!) Guys, you have to try this. You will LOVE the rewards! (I hope you guys print this w/o my email address in here because you're not getting it. No way. Too shy.)"
3,Pleasures wasn't that pleasurable,"While I did enjoy some of the stories that this book offered, overall it didn't contain anything new or stimulating. Some of the stories were poorly written and others didn't even seem to belong in this book. Next time, I'll be a little more choosy before purchasing a book of this nature."
3,Ok.......but no keeper.,"I was surprised to find (in the biographies) the authors of several of the articles/stories were journalists, poets, and writers. I thought several of the stories were poorly written and could have been greatly improved to be more erotic or sensual if retold or rewritten by a more advanced writer. I also skipped all of the girl/girl stories which I myself can't manage to find sensual. Overall, it was ok and there were a few moving stories but I wouldn't classify this book as a do-over to keep and read again."
2,OK,"I think this book is ok for some. I already have a vivid imaginiation, so this book didn't do much for me."
1,Not ideal for true shoppers,"A bunch of my girlfriends and I live in Hong Kong and are serious shoppers in Asia. We found this book to be outdated, commercialized and definitely not clued in to where the best shopping lies, particularly for Shanghai and Beijing. There are so many wonderful boutiques which were not included. You are likely to get the same information from the local hotel concierge if not more."
3,Good but could be better,"Good solid tips on where to go for good shopping for the 1st time visitor, but it could be organized better as it tends to jump around and return to the same topic. For example, in Shanghai, the book mentions the Dong Tai Market under Bargaining, Old City, Antiques and Antiques Market when it could have been in one section.Also, for Hong Kong, the book gives a plug for the Hong Tourism Agency (p.44). However, beware their ""QTS"" seal of approval for trustworthy stores. I got ripped off at one of their approved stores (Louvre Jewelry) and they said they could not help address the problem."
3,Good Film,"This is a good animated film, the story follows a young woman and her friend as they try to locate her older brother as he was drafted by the army when a war broke out against Giant robots. We see the struggle they have to go through in locating the brother and the people they meet.Overall this is a good film, with a good story behind it, and it was mostly all done by one man, Tyler Gibb."
5,looks good,"easy install, has different bolt patterns to fit into hitch. Im running a 35"" spare and it fit with no problems. Great for the camping weekend. I also use it if the kids get rowdy in the car, I will let them know their is room for them on it, and all the arguments seem to stop and the car becomes nice and quite."
2,Cheap,This thing is flimsy and arrived scratched. It has rained once since i got it and it's already rusting.Keep looking and avoid this.
5,Hitch haul basket,I was very pleased with the quality and functionality of the Valley 90590 Deluxe Hitch Mount Cargo Basket.It was even better than I had envisioned. A perfect option for hauling bulky things and a very secure way to tie them down with the heavy duty metal sideledge.I would recommend without hesitation.
4,Worked great for a 2500 mile road trip.,Like other similar carriers I tried from a local store this one had a loose fit and would make some noise when making turns. Despite that inconvenience this worked great. We used this behind our van for a 2500 mile road trip. It held 4 large suitcases upright and a small cooler.
5,hitch mounted carrier,"The carrier was easy to assemble and has two different mounting depths, one that is close to the bumper and one that adds some space in case you have a rear door mounted spare. It is light enough for one person to handle yet it appears to be constructed well. We used it with a Rola Expandable Cargo Bag, .Rola 59102 Expandable Hitch Tray Cargo Bag - 9.5-11.5 Cubic Feetto transport extra luggage to the Outer Banks and on the beach to carry coolers, beach chairs, etc. Works well and is highly recommended."
2,Sorta Adequate,"I purchased this item to augment the cargo carrying capacity of my Highlander. It does that, but it is of typical ""made in China"" quality. I used it to tote coolers and Rubbermaid tubs totaling about 100 pounds and it worked fine but I would not put any heavy items in this as the floor is fabricated from very light expanded metal mesh. It was cheap enough but you get what you pay for. Do some research."
3,Good but not heavy duty,"I've had my Valley hitch about a month and I'm happy with it. I will say that I would never put 500lbs of stuff on this carrier. The wire mesh that is the bottom is medium duty at best. When I put my 47lb Honda 2000 generator on the carrier I have to make sure the generator straddles the center support beam or else the wire mesh bows too much.I also want to point out that the reflectors you see in the pictures are actually cheap tape and not a true plastic reflector.In summary, I'm happy with the carrier as I don't have heavy duty loads to haul. If you do, look elsewhere."
2,cargo carrier,"The company sent me a used carrier when I purchased a new one. I am very disappointed. If I had wanted a used one, I would have bought a used one. I had obviously been assembled, used, disassembled, and put back in the box. There were obvious scratches caused by the wrenches. I had to paint the entire unit to make it presentable. I will never purchase anything from Valley again."
5,Valley 90590 Hitch,"The packaging gets knocked around during shipping, but all was well when opened. Very easy to put together by yourself. Happy with the hitch and the price paid on Amazon."
1,broken and missing,Box arrived all broken up. The reversible bar is missing and the basket has a broken weld. Didn't work had to be returned.
2,wish I had purchased the Carpod,"after purchasing this item I realized that tying down the cargo was not my thing... a few weeks later a friend of mine showed me a new product he had purchased called the CARPOD. It is basically the same concept as this basket, except that it has 22"" high sidewalls so I don't need to tie down anything. Another cool thing about it is that all four sidwalls fold down and so it's much easier to store than this basket. I returned the item and purchased a CARPOD. [...]"
2,Can't say I am impressed.,"I opened the box up for the Valley 90590 Hitch Cargo Basket and I was a little disapointed in how light duty it is. Everything about it except for the 2 inch bar seems week. I also found that one of the Supports underneath the unit had only been Tack welded on and had broke loose I am going to take it to a Fab shop that I know and see if they can fix that, and maybe add some strength here and there. I just thought it would have been a stronger unit. Lets put it this way I would not try to stand on it accept maybe over the 2 inch tube but not on eather end I think it would just bend right down. We are taking it on our vacation and I hope we do not have any problems with it. I do not think I would buy from this Company again."
1,Bad parts,"My mistake was being too trusting when I received an obviously repackaged unit. When I went to open three weeks later in preparation for a trip, I found a manufacturing defect by which Step 1 of assembly could not be accomplished because of mismatched ends. The unit had obviously been returned previously, and instead of being culled, was simply repackaged and sent back out. Highly irritating. The packaging was so tight that the box could not be reused, and the time/effort/expense of a return was not worth it to me. I will go buy local or from another company that is hopefully more trustworthy."
1,Didn't care for these,"I hoped to be able to use these as school snacks, but neither of my kids like them. I served them on a sideboard of fingerfoods at a family gathering, and my dad said, ""What are these? They are totally tasteless."" They are also fuul of sugar.I won't buy these again."
4,WE WANT MOORE!,"Vinnie Moore is one gifted guitar instrumentalist. Not only providing one incredible all guitar albums I ever heard with The Maze, but this 12 track CD holds up very well against most other live CD's that require a singer. This particular CD ws recorded during Vinn's 1999 tour with MSG and anyone who went to those shows or own a copy of MSG The Unforgiven Live will immediately notice that he used the same, very talented musicians as did Schenker. But back to the album, 6 are off of his most recent Maze CD, including Rain, Thinking Machine, Never Been To Barcelona, and the title track. Other Vinnman classics are Vinnman's Brew, and Melting Pot. Any own who wants to hear an incredible display of musicianship where all participants get there 2 cents in the spotlight have to pick this one up."
1,Yuck,"I am just amazed that people would really want to listen to the Beatles this way. I mean, why not buy the Beatles albums?"
1,I DISAGREE WITH BOB,"Calling this CD ""POODLE POOP"" is being way too kind. I would discourage anyone from buying this kind if drivel. You're a good man Bob, just too kind, that's all......."
1,Dissappointed,My cousin and I are on a continuous battle to lose weight and tone up. We each look for the latest excercise books and give them a fair go of it before making conclusions. This one did not pass our tone test after 3 months. We basically do what each expert says to do then evaluate each other with a thumbs up or down. We gave this one a thumbs down. But we split the cost of the book so not everything is lost.
5,lost 3 inches,"This is a great guide for people who don't have a lot of time to workout, and don't want to belong to a gym. With a couple of dumbbells and a medicine ball, I've been able to tighten up my midsection. That's something I haven't done with any other program. I've lost three inches so far. I would just like to see more diet advice."
3,Selene Yeager's Perfectly Fit: 8 ways to a sleek & sexy body,"Selene Yeager's Perfectly Fit: 8 ways to a sleek & sexy body is a decent book for anyone who does not have much knowledge of exercising. There are a lot of good exercises recommended which are divided into the area of the body an individual may want to target. There are also various routines for indivuduals who may not know what excerises to combine. If you are looking for an inspirational book, this is not the book for you. Overall, it is a decent book to review, especially if you are interested in changing your daily exercise routine."
1,Perfectly fit for who,"As a former athlete who's fallen away in the last few years, I found this book was not as worthwhile as I had wanted. I think I'd have to do these exercises WAY more than 8 weeks to get back in shape. A bit unrealistic given the types of exercises that are presented."
1,Not real Challenging,This book was OK as a motivator maybe for some but the exercises are somewhat awkward. Seems unrealistic for a 190 lb gal to hang under a table and do pull ups on the edge. Obviously no doctor wrote this book. The motivating thoughts are good but seems like I've seen these ideas in Prevention magazine a million times.
1,7 weeks into it,"Ok so I'm 7 weeks into following this program. Although I feel better about myself for getting started on a workout regimen, I am certainly not sleek. And forget about slim. I asked my doctor about this and he said 8 weeks is really unrealistic and potentially dangerous. To try to meet exaggerated fitness expectations through people who purportedly can guarantee extrordinary results through thier books is plain ignorance. If the claim SOUNDS ""Too Good To Be True""...it is. Maybe this last week the big miracle happens. Then I'll come back with a raving review."
4,Works fine.,"I've had this item for over a year and it works fine. Simple, easy to use and understand interface. No frills( that's a plus) Only complaint is the first one I had had intermittent problems reading the smartmedia card. At first I thought the problem was the card (it wasn't). I exchanged the unit it's worked fine ever since."
2,just my luck,"apparently doesn't work with windows xp program, my usb port is not detected when i plug the mp3 player into it.."
3,Not bad,"I've had it for about 2 years not and it hasen't messed up once. Though when bought this it was top of the line but you can now buy MP3s for almost the same price, maybe 20 bucks more...but it will have like 3x the memory. Don't buy this now unless you plan to upgrade later (maybe get smart and invest in a Ipod...i did and that works fine too)Just my opinion."
1,what?,when was this made?-the1700? an 8 track holds more and it's HUUUUGE. go buy yourself a shuffle for 40$ more and it holds 64x the space
2,Plews/Edelmann water Nozzle,"I have had other nozzles of this type before and found them easy to use, not this one. It requires just the right finger or fingers placement to work and what I beleive is excessive pressure to make it function. It is more of an innorance to use than a regular nozzle."
5,Excellent Biblical counsel for families,"I really enjoyed and learned alot from this book. I don't think there are many if any other books out there that deal with the subject of a child's heart and provoking a child to anger the Biblical way this one does. A great compliment to Tedd Tripp's Shephearding a Child's Heart. If you loved that one, you'll love this one, too!"
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I bought this book hoping that it would help me find a way to end the angry outbursts of my young children, however this book was written more for older already rebellious children. It may be helpful to others but was not useful for us."
3,Too soon to tell.,"Yet another book given to me by my Church counselor. While it is full of useful tools for Christian focused parenting I had to giggle at the hopelessly outdated 'Leave It To Beaver' style of dialogue that Priolo passes of as parent/child interaction, ""Honey, the real problem is that you are too willful..."", ""You should desire to please the Lord by honoring and obeying your parents more than you desire to have fun on the weekends as well as during the week."" Trying to find the best manner to instill positive and Godly (i.e. moral) values in a child is one of the most frustrating and difficult responsibilities for any parent. There are no easy answers or methods, as the labor intensive tools offered in The Heart of Anger show. The one thing to keep in mind is that it is all about training and educating, not the breaking of the will and rebuilding it in a manner found acceptable. I can't say how well the book worked for me, but some of the early work is showing some payoff."
1,The Heart of Anger,"This book was recommended by an acquaintance who neglected to mention that, in order for the book to make sense, the reader would have to be a biblical expert. The text is sprinkled with references to chapter and verse. The reviews on Amazon gave no indication that this book is really only relavent to someone who believes the bible--old and new testament--are absolute and literal truth. As someone who does not hold that belief, the book is totally a waste of paper for me.I only wish I could return it."
4,Good nutritional value,"This product is very easy to make--just add water and spice packet and 25 minutes later you have lentil rice pilaf. Very good source of protein and fiber. I always add more spices to mine, however, because the flavor leaves something to be desired if you don't."
3,Skeptical about science,"Although his general skepticism about many aspects of the various beliefs in aliens and extraterrestrial life is evident, I find the lack of skepticism regarding the credibility of ""hard science"" and his constant criticism of postmodernism a bit disturbing.Generally the book is worth reading, but don't ever forget that this is just one person's perspective on things."
1,alternate reality,"In addition to the misleading title, this book is rambling and superficial. Dont waste your time like I did."
4,back in the saddle,"Gene is always great to see.I missed this series, but great to see the singing cowboy again.Especially like his folksy advertising of chewing gum at the startof each episode."
3,Are these episodes really UNCUT,"Although I have Pre-Ordered this Gene Autry Box-Set I have to say I am very skeptical about the Runtimes of the show.According to Timeless Media's description of this set there are 26 episodes and some extras with a Total Runtime of 650 minutes, this makes each episode a maximum of 25 mintues.Yet I have the two DVD issues of the Gene Autry Show issued by IMAGE Entertainment(available and bought from Amazon) and each show runs for 30 minutes. So how can this new set be UNCUT ? Although I would like to give this set 5 stars, for now I would rate it at 3 stars because of the seemingly apparent cuts."
5,good news,"delivery was very fast, product was as advertised, would not hesitate to do business with this vendor again"
2,Good musicians,"I have tired to like the Flower Kings but they always leave me unsatisfied. I own two of their discs, and still listen to them repeatedly thinking they will grow on me, but they never do. Maybe I have their weakest discs? Some of the songs on this live outing are very good... ""Sounds of Violence"", ""Big Puzzle"", but many songs are rubbish and this inconsistency leaves me unimpressed."
5,An eye opener on the U.S./NATO bombing of Yugoslavia,"The book will open your eyes. It will help you understand what is happening in the Balkans. It will inform the new generation of anti-war activists now emerging in opposition to U.S./NATO expansion and the savage bombing of Yugoslavia. Anyone interested in the truth should rush to get a copy of ""NATO in the Balkans."""
2,A travesty,"This is so poorly produced. The piano and guitar playing lacks feeling, the singing is flat. Sounds like a monotonous sampler of Peruvian music performed by people who have never heard the real thing."
3,Great essayist...poorly laid-out edition,"These three stars don't reflect my opinion of Orwell as an essayist. Anyone who has read Orwell's non-fiction knows that he is one of this century's greatest journalists/essayists. The poor rating targets the layout of the volume.It's an insult to a writer of Orwell's stature to have put together such an extensive volume (1,424 pages!) of his best work so amaturishly. There's no index, no notes section and no specification of which essay you're on at the head of the page. The table of contents is practially useless, as most of the essays are numbered.Physically, the book is beautiful: a matte cover, with a great portrait of Orwell, cream-wove paper, sewn binding and a sewn in bookmark. But it is in no way user friendly. If you're looking to dive into Orwell's essays and journalism check out the David R. Godine editions."
5,Creature from the Black Lagoon!,"OK, so maybe you think that Creature from the Black Lagoon hands may not be on every 49 year old woman's list, but I loved these. I bought a mask to match too. For Halloween next year, I am going to stuff a creature to go with Frankie, Count, Pumpkin man, Witchie Poo, and others. Life is too short, not to play and enjoy every moment - especially Halloween!"
5,Excellent quality door handle.,"I changed 3 sets of sliding door handles to these beautiful satin nickel ones. After 6 months, they still look brand new. Very easy to install."
3,Controversy,"Read the book, but also take time to research what has been going on while she has been on watch as the Harris County ME. I wouldn't say that her management skills are something that would inspire me."
3,Did not work with T-Mobile SDA,"I gave it 3 stars, because these earbuds don't work with T-mobile SDA phone. The earbuds seem to working fine on a compatible phone. If they were workin with the SDA, I would have given them more stars. There is only sound coming out of one of the earbuds. Didn't want to go through the trouble of sending them back."
2,"Poor Design, Cheap Construction, No foam pads","I bought two of these headsets for my Motorola E815. The construction of the headsets is poor. One ear piece separated when channel the ear cannel gels that came with it. Please note that it does not come with foam earpads like the box says so you are stuck with the eargels. The left side cord is 3 times the length of the right so it either goes behind your head or it look ridiculous on your front, a huge flaw in my opinion. All said sound quality out of my phone is decent and it comes with a 3.5mm adapter to plug into a laptop or ipod. It's a shame that a decent pair of 2.5mm stereo headphones isn't on the market yet."
1,Overpriced and Under performing.,"I picked this up at Office Depot. My version has 2.5 and 3.5mm in one. I thought this convenience was awesome; I could use the buds for home phone, laptop and cell phone. Wrong...the mic on this device is useless. You have to hold it to your mouth for anybody to hear you. Then the clip fell off somewhere in the street. The wire for the left ear is too large and droops down. It looks cheap.So I used it very mildly for a few months on my laptop until the jack wore out and I had to jiggle it for it to work.Most importantly, the sound quality was sub par. Bass is decent, but not good. Some of the high end sounds are missing.The good part is that the gels are great. They really keep the bud in your ears while your on the go. Overall this is a definite no buy."
1,RECEIVED EAR BUDS IN WRONG PLUG SIZE WITH NO ADAPTER WHICH WAS TO BE INCLUDED,"Either it was to good to be true for the price, or someone working for this company doesn't know how to tell the difference between the two types of plug end sizes..the ad said that the stereo ear buds where 2.5mm my cell phone requires a 2.5mm. The ad also states that there is an adapter included with the ear buds, converting them to 3.5 if needed, NO ADAPTER. I ordered 2 sets ...both packaged with no labeling so you cant tell if they are, the right plug size..until you open the ziplock plastic bag and plug it into the phone jack..needless to say the jack on the ear bud was the wrong size. it came to me in the size of 3.5mm which was not the ad size....i am very disappointed in service quality. i dont want to use an adapter to get the right size for the phone because it will stick out too far from the end of the phone..would rather the plug fit directly to the phone end...big let down ..."
1,Sadly disappointed....,"From the product description (""Automatically mutes to receive incoming calls and resumes playing when you have finished your call"") you'd believe that the headphones plug into the mp3 player and phone simultaneously. Unfortunately, the headphones plug into only one or the other at a time.I'm still looking for a product that does exactly what I want it to do."
3,decent but not great,"the box claims that the item comes with 3 sets of ear gels and a set of foam inserts. it does not come with the foam but the gels are surprisingly comfortable. sound quality leaves something to be desired. they seem to be an ""OK"" set of headphones but i think still a bit overpriced. ($30 in the store. i see they're cheaper here though.)"
4,"querky, but worth the price because of performance","I bought these for when I ride my motorcycle. The earphones come with 3 sizes of ear molds that will fit just about everyone. It takes some playing with to get your right size and then to figure out the little nub goes in the front. But after that the earphones were great: soft feel, stayed in place without problems, good sound. I would recommend these. :)"
1,Don't Buy!,I don't think it's possible to make a more uncomfortable pair of head phones. They are awful! I would recommend the Plantronics MHS213 Stereo Mobile Headset. Very happy with the Plantronics.
2,You get what you pay for,"I received them in the promised time. However, when I got them the left ear didn't work. I didn't view it as a big enough problem to return the item. I use it to listen to music at the gym and occasionally talk on the phone. The sound is clear though not great.I would not recommend this item. Spend a little more money and get something that won't come to you half working."
1,Bad item,I don't like this item because it does not work for my phone. I have an huawei ascend m860 which has an 2.5mm plug for music. I bought the jabra c120 stereo earbuds because i thought it would work for my phone but it don't. I would not tell anyone to purchase this item.
1,Not worth the shipping to return!,"I DID not get what I ordered. I recieved a damaged pair of earbuds with NO packaging that aren't worth the price of returning. I am incredibly dissapointed because the review of the product and the seller were mostly good. Buyer, beware."
1,Absolute Junk Verzion Returns,"The earpiece is refurbished I believe. Mine came with a broken verizon lapel clip. While the earpiece may not be meant for my spec phone (palm treo 700) I figured I could use it with my lifedrive to listen to music, but wait there is no music adapter. It was supposed to come with an adapter according to the discription. I honestly cant find anything positive to say. When I did plug it into my phone only the right ear had sound. the same thing happened in my house phone. This is the second one they have shipped me so I am going to go out on a limb and say that they are all defective."
1,cheap quality,these headphones didn't last one day. Very disappointed. The quality is very cheap & i would not recommend this to anybody
1,Seemed at first like they were great.....,"The earbuds were uncomfortable until I understood how you should place them into ears comfortably. On the first day however, one earbud came apart making the headset unusable."
4,get what you pay for,i ordered these earphones for my LG EnV to listen to music during my commute. they are excellent and lightweight. the inline microphone make a great compliment for phone calls. the ear pieces are a little awkward but not a big deal and comfortable.
1,Ruby Red Mugs,The picture and the description of these mugs made me think I was ordering the Holly and Berry pattern that my sister collects. The mugs that arrived were ruby red. I shipped the mugs back hoping for an exchange for the correct mugs. This didn't happen because they don't have the holly and berry pattern. I lost money on this (my shipping) and had to scramble for another Christmas gift!
4,Refreshing!,"I've taught writing for 12 years, and this is one of the best books I've come across in that time. The only reason I didn't give it five stars has nothing to do with the authors--... A book on writing should be especially well-checked for typos and layout errors, but this one has more than its fair share. Still, this is a good book, and I look forward to using it in my teaching."
4,Excellent Guide,"Indeed this is a pamphlet, so be prepared for a quick read. Fortunately, it is concise and accurate. If you are presented with the challenge of developing goals and/or metrics for your service group, start here. Spend $10 and save yourself a few hours because all the information you need is right here--it makes no sense to re-invent the wheel!"
3,Shocking Part Defined Book For Me,"I love all books set in England, and this one was no exception, except for the shocker at the end of this book which I really found rather..sick. I usually re-read my favorites, but after I read this one, even though I liked it a lot, I was never able to pick it up and read it again. I identified with the main character, Rachel, because growing up I always felt like she did, on the outside of things looking in. I enjoyed this book a lot but if you are the very prim type, I wouldn't recommend it because this book's shocking ending will offend you. I'm not even the prim type, and I couldn't stomach it! Otherwise, it is a well-written and interesting book."
1,Awful,"Trite and boring, this book offers two dimensional characters at best. I couldn't wait to finish and be done with it. Simplistic plot leads to a not so shocking ending (process of elimination anyone?) This one gets used to line the bird cage!"
4,Electric God-interesting read,This was a quick read. Very different from most books read lately and very enjoyable. Location well described and very different characters.
4,Really liked it!,"I have enjoyed all of CRH's books I've read so far. Easy to read, immediately interesting. Look forward to reading more."
4,Interesting,It took me a bit to wrap my head around this story but I enjoyed it in the end. Not your typical flow to a book.
1,Very dull,"I bought this book(used thankfully & not full price)after reading and enjoying ""Pay it Forward"" and ""Chasing Windmills"". This book was boring from page one. Very slow. I tried to stick with it, but the story did not improve. Disappointed!"
4,"Let it go man, let it go!","After reading this book you may have to ask yourself (maybe), what are you so mad about! The old saying ""if it weren't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all!""Once the main character got over all the anger and hurt he had an empty soul to fill. The main character was so buried in the past. Another old saying ""in a hundreds years from now, who will give a @!#*!"" (I kept it clean!)This book will point out all the joys in life that could be missed if a mind-set is focused on the negative.Worry looks around, sorrow looks behind......."
3,Interesting Ideas that Go Too Far,"Richard Rudgley's The Lost Civilations of the Stone Age brings up some very interesting ideas and delves into news ways of looking at the prehistoric past. It is important to view the stone age peoples with more open minds than is usually done and this book could be a good place to begin that examination. The only serious flaw of this book, and it sometimes could be quite grating, was the author's insistence on building up his case by dramatically overemphasing the importance and achievements of these ancestors of ours. Any evidence, however spurious, was included. It felt, at times, that the author felt that unless he proved that the stone age peoples were, in fact, superior to all other peoples that followed he had not fulfilled his mission. The book became a competition instead of simply a way of presenting the facts of the stone age and allowing their own achievements to stand. It was an interesting read, although at times it could be quite frustrating."
2,Same old stuff,"I cannot recommend this book. It's the same old stuff, an establishment archaeologist clinging to 1930's theories. He closes his mind to paradigm shattering works that render this book obsolete--works like ""Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings"" by Hapgood; ""The Origin Map"" by Brophy; and ""Giza Powerplant,"" by Dunn. Instead of addressing the theories of researchers like Z. Sitchin, he unscientifically dismisses them with an unscientific smirk and a laugh, exposing an unwillingness to inspect anything that violates his establishment prejudices."
1,Rudgley relies heavily on linguistics but misuses it,"Rudgley's book cannot be taken seriously as an attempt to re-write pre-history. His argument is confused at the outset by his failure to define 'civilisation' and his apparent tacit adoption of an unreasonably wide definition, which makes it very easy for him to claim cheap success. The mainstream ideas he attacks are mostly 'straw men'. Much of his specific 'evidence' is linguistic (or at least involves what are claimed to be early manifestations of written language), but this is discussed within the framework of the highly controversial ideas of Gimbutas. The evidence for anything resembling written language at the relevant dates is, to say the least, tenuous. Rudgley also relies heavily on fringe philological theories. He has in no way demonstrated his case and his scholarship is highly suspect."
4,Very classy but wished more tinted.,The desiign is pretty cool and look very awesome. Just wishes they were more tinted due to the caribbean sun that hits me everyday :p
1,so so slowly for dlivery,i order this item's on 29/6still i did't resiving any thingand i send email to coustmer serviers and nothing happend and no respond
2,Incompatable patched through VCR,"Because the DVD Player only has RCA type A/V outputs I knew it would not be able to hook directly to my older TV that only has a single cable input, however I expected I could at least run it through my VCR's A/V connections first as a bridge to the TV. WRONG, The DVD player emits some kind of copyright protection signal that messes up your picture when patched through a VCR and it even says so in the instructions. Is this what copy protection has come to? Its unfortuneate because like me, many people purhacing a unit in this price are just looking for an inexpensive add on to thier same basic and common set up. There is a special adapter that can resolve this, but at a cost almost as much as the DVD player, whats the point?"
2,R.I.P. 2003-2004,"I got this DVD player less than a year ago. It worked great until it suddenly and unexpectedly died. Completely dead, won't even turn on. And to make it even better, it died with one of my DVD's inside, and there's no way to get it out. So if you're looking for a disposable DVD player that will possibly take permanent posession one of your movies when it dies, this would be a good choice. Otherwise, you might want to find another option."
1,Cyberhome ch-dvd320,Bad!!!!! Just like the other reviews It worked the first time out of the box but when I got around to using it again it would not even power up. Target should consider sending them all back to the Company and never use the brand again. I am very disappointed.
1,Should have read the reviews!!,"I bought this DVD player for my daughter for Christmas 2003. It looked like it would be good - it was cheap and small. However, I wish I would have read the reviews first before purchasing it!! After 4 months, the DVD player quit working. It kept trying to read the disc but never would play. At first I thought my daughter had done something to it, but when it wouldn't even open to release the DVD, I knew something was wrong with it. Since April, I've been looking for another one for her and decided to wait until her birthday in August to buy her another one. Don't waste your money on this player - or in my case, break your childs heart when they can no longer watch movies in their room!! After reading these reviews, I think CyberHome should have done a recall on this player! It looks like they were all defective!"
5,Some Hidden Features You should know,"I can't understand the negative reviews here. My Cyberhome player has been a champ from the day I plugged it in. I have one of their previous DVD players also.Picture quality from Componet cables or S-Video is as good as more expensive models. But when I found out it plays PAL discs from Europe without ANY hacks I was thrilled. A friend recently came back from Prague with a couple of Czech movies encoded in PAL. Her parents Toshiba DVD player spit them out. I found a hack for the cyberhome online, and told her to bring the DVDs over. I was expecting to enter a complicated series of codes from the remote, but decided to put the DVD in first to see what happened. To our delight, the movie came up on the TV screen with no problem! Not only is this little silver wizard region free, it automatically senses PAL and converts it to NTSC on the fly! How can it get any better for 40 bucks?Oh yeah, I do hate the remote. But that's minor compared to the value I got."
4,Great little dvd player that will play ANYTHING it is given!,"This player is small on price but big on options! When using import dvd's,it will automatically adjust to the NTSC(US & Canada)or PAL(Europe) formats. You can also play region 2 & 3 dvd's by leaving the tray closed (with no disc) & entering: MENU,1,9. A new menu will appear that lets you select any region in the world! VERY COOL option for someone like me who orders from Amazon.co.uk all the time! I will be buying another one to replace my 100.00 lame-o region 1 ONLY Sony player."
1,Great Little Quitter :-(,"We received the CyberHome CH-DVD 320 as a Christmas gift and were delighted with it until it suddenly stopped working 6 months later. It started to 'stall' while playing a movie, and we blamed it on the disk. Then it would get 'stuck' trying to READ a disk, and again we blamed it on the disk. In fact, a message would sometimes come up which read 'Bad Disk'. That same bad disk would play in another DVD player. Finally, it quit working altogether, so I unplugged the unit and let it set for a couple of days. When I plugged it back in, the unit would NOT power up, and that's the present condition of my Great Little Quitter --- Stone Dead!!! But it was Great while it lasted..."
2,Untimely death,"I was given this DVD player as a gift this past Christmas. It was wonderful. Small, sleek, worked excellent. Until one fateful day at the end of April. After less that six months, it stopped working. All in one movie, without any warning, it began to stall, skip, screech (and I do mean screech)and then tell me the movie was a bad disk. So I instered a different movie and was immediately told that it, too, was a bad movie. Oh, well. I guess you do get what you pay for."
1,Absolute Worst,"This is the absolute worst player I have ever dealt with. I have been through 2 units now. Both just freeze up (On a brand new store bought DVD) You have to shut it off for 5-10 minutes before it will start working again. I also haven't found a universal remote that works with it, so you have to use the way too small remote with the way too small buttons. I would never waste my money on this brand again. Only reason I am on my second is because it was replaced free of charge. WORST PLAYER EVER!"
1,Very bad buy,"I purchased 2 of these units for the size and price. Within a year , they have both stopped reading discs. One of the units also had trouble with the audio cutting off and on.<br />I would call this a very bad buy."
2,Disposable DVD player.,"This player worked great through about 20 uses, then died. Too bad; it has lots of features and is nice and small (semi-portable). Very disappointing. I'd stay away from Cyber Home."
2,unexpected death,"I have to agree with the previous reviewers. This machine worked excellent for the price. Also because there were only a few buttons on the front, it's simple to operate. But, just like one of the other reviewers, the player died on me unexpectedly. I have no idea why, but it just refused to turn on... no lights, no sound, no nothing. The worst part was I had a rented DVD locked inside. I ended up have to pry the door open, breaking it, in order to get the DVD out."
1,Junk,The DVD player won't last long. I have had the player since December but only used it for 2 1/2 months. I probably only played 20 or less dvds on it and it is dead. You get what you pay for I guess.
4,This Dvd player,"I got this DVD player last christmas and is still working great. At times it is hard to use the remote, like in a dark place because all the buttons are the same size and shape. It can also be loud and take a while to open and close, and to start the movie. I reccommend it for bedrooms that dont use it that oftem, any other room and you should buy a better one."
1,Disposable DVD Player,- Lasted less than 1 year- Bad picture (very pixilated)- Stopped playing CDs right away- Lots of dirty disk errorsWhat do you want for the price?!
1,"BAD, BAD, VERY BAD",when its working its great but i havent even had mine a year and it just died today. My dvd is now stuck in the machine. Wouldnt buy it ever again. And i dont think you should either its just a waste of money.
2,Problem with remote,"After ten months of usage, remote control won't work. So far, so good in terms of playing DVDs. I got two more months???"
1,Very Dissapointed..Do Not Purchase,I bought 2 of these on recomendation from the sales guy. They were purchased in August for Christmas gifts for my 2 boys and on Christmas day right out of the box one would not power up and the other would lose sound and have a messed up picture like I was watching satelite in bad weather. I do not recommend anyone purchase this item.....
1,"BAD DISC error. It's too bad, really.","I enjoyed this player for almost one year to the day. Tonight, mid-movie it froze, and displayed the Bad Disc message on a practically brand new disc (as others have complained). I tried another disc, and it played part of the studio intro, then went to Bad Disc. A third disc worked, but I can tell the player is dying. A real shame though, because I liked its compact size and simple design while it lasted."
1,beware after 6 months,"I bought this 6 months ago and it worked fine until yesterday, when suddenly the audio track would not play. Audio played during the root menu and during all the special features, but no sound during the main feature. I went online and found that this is apparently a common problem, and usually occurs around 6 months. No one had a fix that worked for me. I have not contacted cyberhome's customer service (apparently very difficult to do), but at this price, I'm just going to buy a new one of a more trustworthy brand."
1,Paperweight,"The box these things come in is worth more than the unit itself. I have had two, given two as gifts and the most used unit lasted more than the least used. All four units have died. The most use I have received from ANY of these units has been about a year. My advice, KEEP YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,You get what you pay for!!,"Yep, just as many of the other reviews state, one year is about all you get with this DVD player. Actually, ours lasted 10 months and died, no power, lights out!"
2,Was good while it lasted,"I bought this one the day after thanksgiving last year. It worked pretty well until the day after Thanksgiving this year (conveniently the day the warranty expires!).I know it is inexpensive, and it weathered a good deal of use in my house over that year, but in the end it was not a good buy! I could buy a more expensive unit that will last me longer and in the end cost me less than replacing this one every year."
3,cheap wonder,it works for me almost a year now.the only downside is its component output doesn't have any color on the TV. ;-(
3,"It's okay, but definitely too expensive","When I was younger, I had read some nice Amar Chitra books. Among them was the Birbal series. Now those books were really good, and I was looking to see if I could find them again. But I couldn't find that series anywhere, and I decided I would try out this book.To be fair, this book is very well illustrated. And it gives a nice history into how Birbal and Akbar first meet (which I didn't know before). And the stories here are similar to what I remember reading as a kid. But after the first few stories, something seems to be lacking and it loses its appeal. There were so many other nice stories about Birbal that I was hoping to read. This book covers only a few of them.Still, given that it's hard to find anything else, this book isn't so bad. But it is definitely way too expensive. For the price, I would rather have a lot more stories and less pictures."
4,Great introduction to Indian Tales,My seven year old loved these tales about clever Birbal. A great way to introduce her to a different culture. Also good morals in the tales
4,Kustom Profile PA,"I purchased a year ago. I have put this system through tons of heavy gigging, indoors, outdoors, etc and It has performed great. I do use a 15"" speaker for more bass because they are somewhat thin sounding cometimes. I had one problem with the speaker jack stripping but that was an easy fix. My system has never overheated, even on 100 degree patios here in the humid midwest. Absolutly worth the $200 I paid new."
5,A Systems Approach to Software Architecture,"Anyone who is caught up in the real world of software development knows that most books on the subject talk about what should happen and not so much what could and most likely will happen. That is, real people work in real organizations and, for example, dependencies between groups of people can slow things down or in other ways hamper the development progress. Dikel, et al, do a great job defining patterns and anti-patterns and their overiding principles. This book is a great guide for software development Project Managers who could use guidance when planning a project and when the going gets rough."
2,Light reading -- my mistake,"I should have research the contents much more, it has the basics but that was then, need updating to today's environments and projects."
5,Awesome buy.,"I buy this cologne for my father every year. He loves it and I am glad to find it on Amazon. It smells great. I purchased it two years in a row from Amazon and the shipping was timely and the product was in good shape. The last time I bought it, I was filling out the order and the picture looked a little different so I was worried but I got the two bottles I ordered and it was the correct cologne. I was very satisfied with the result. This cologne is hard to find. I only have been able to find it at perfume kiosks in malls and I have to bargain with the seller each time as it is always overpriced so Amazon has helped make this yearly purchase easier."
3,A weak play becomes a movie,"This film is not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims, in his much-read movie book, but it does lack a lot, beginning with the script. The film consists of more than two hours of a couple of writers, somehow in love with each other but unable or unwilling to marry, fussing, fighting, and shouting. And in the end, even though their sexual escapade proved less than thrilling, they end in a clinch on a couch. Happing ending. The film is not very romantic and certainly isn't funny. The moral dimensions of the script are wholly secular and consistently depressing. Marriage and children are nothing when compared to sexual urges, booze, and fame.But there are some good lines in places. And the acting is superb. Dudley Moore and Mary Steenburgen are something to behold. The music is above average, and Arthur Hiller displays his usual excellence as a director. But even the stars of the film were unable to put life into a lame script that is at least 30 minutes too long."
3,breast cancer survivor,This was an ok DVD. I have been 4.5 yrs breast cancer survivor with bil mastectomies with immed. reconstruction. I had no radiation or chemotherpy and all at once lost my range of motion. After a month of physical therapy I thought I would buy DVD to help me stay on the right path.
2,"Funny at times, but makes parenthood look depressing...","The authors can be very clever, but most of the jokes seem to come at the expense of the children that they created and raised. Is parenthood really this much of an unpleasant chore, and are women STILL stuck in such stereotypical roles? Not in my circles. If you don't have children, beware, this book could scare you away from parenting."
1,Two bitter women,"My wife picked up this book somewhere. I took a look through it, and was surprised at the bitterness that passes for humor. Such scheming and mental manipulation of family members I have never seen openly joked about in print this way. The co-writers mistakenly assume that most other woman are like them. They need to stop congratulating themselves on their own cleverness and concentrate on the positivity in life--or they should get some help."
1,Awful Awful Smell,I am pretty shocked to find that this product has so many positive stars. I usually use Hagerty Silver Cleaner but they did not have it in stock so I opted for TarnX. I was cleaning a silver bowl and the smell was so bad I couldn't handle it. It stunk up my ENTIRE house like rotten eggs. I am going to return this immediately and would highly advice against purchasing this product. If you do decide to give it a try keep your receipt as they have a 100% money back guarantee.
3,nice watch but battery life limited,I bought two of these about the same time so I would have a watch plus a spare watch. One went dead today. I dug through my old orders to see how long I had it. Got it in May 2012 and it conked out late Dec 2012.So that is 6-7 months life on one battery. I was going to buy a new one since I figure the battery is liable to be more expensive than just getting a new watch.I am used to watches lasting years on one battery. Probably because this is nice and lightweight it probably also has a nice and lightweight and unfortunately also low-lifespan battery.I may try to spend a bit more and get a watch that runs longer on its original batteries.
4,Men's Simple Black Watch,Length:: 2:23 MinsCasio Men's MQ24-1E Analog WatchSimple black watch. Looks trendy but classy. Goes well with casual outfits. Available with gold or silver hands/time markings. Very nice for $10 until I replace this watch with a black Nixon Rotolog. I thought this watch had a metal band the whole way around but it's actually plastic with a design that resembles a band. Still very nice though!
2,way smaller than it looks,im a guy. thats the problem with this watch. maybe a child could wear this small thing i actually just gave it away to a really tiny 130 pound looking dude.
4,Watchband too short,"I like the look, feel and function of the watch. As with most watches this band is too short for my wrist. I tried replacing the band with a NATO style nylon web band, but the space between pins and body is too narrow and thin to accommodate the replacement."
3,Short band,"For the price, this is a good watch. However, the band is too short and there doesn't seem to be a way to remove the back plate to change the battery."
2,"Kids watch, not for Men","This is not a men's watch! I guess I'm different than most because when I received this watch, I immediately started laughing. This watch is very small, the face is smaller than a quarter. I tried to give it to my daughter but she didn't want it, lol. I will probably give it to one of my nephews. To sum it up, the watch probably works well but it looks cheap in person and is extremely small and no, I repeat no grown man should be wearing one if these watches..lol."
5,Excellent,"This is a cheap watch and works well. When it breaks, I'll buy a new one and not worry about repairs."
4,It keeps time,It keeps time and it is cheaper.That is what I was looking for.But the plastic 'glass' is higher than the side of the watch so if you hit it accidentally it might get scratched or broken easily.
5,Great little watch,"I'm a big fan of plastic casio watches. I'm wearing a different model right now, and I alternate with this one pretty regularly. This watch has a really flat face so it's non-obtrusive. If you like thin, simple watches this one is for you.But, feature-wise, it's super simple, though, no backlight (or glow-in-the-dark) or alarm. So it's all-the-time use is a bit limited."
5,Casio Watch,"it is so cool,the watch style is novel, the color is good-looking, suit me fine, and I like very much."
3,nice little face watch,"This is a very nice looking simple semi elegant watch, small face and size. It's a little small for my liking I'll probably give it to my nephew for when he dresses up or casual."
5,cheap,very good cheap watch. it is well worth the money. ten more words. ten more words. ten more words. ten that is all
4,classy looking cheap watch,a good looking watch with a very good price. havent experienced any problems with it and it holds its time pretty well so far.
3,NIce watch but one size too small for my wrist,I wish they had made the band 1/2 inch longer. It only fit me on the last hole and that didn't allow me to tuck the end of the band under the loop. I wound up returning the watch.
3,"Cheap Watch, works fine, don't expect much in terms of aesthetics","I bought this watch for my nephew because he needed a watch that was relatively inexpensive and looked nice. The price on this wacth was perfect however, i did not neccessarily like its looks. So far the watch has been working and we have had no problems with it."
5,"Nice watch, good price","This is a nice watch at an excellent price. Looks good on my wrist, very few features and that is a good thing. It tells time, what more do you want? I also bought a Casio Sports watch at the same time that has way more features than I will ever use. This watch is for dress up, the other for sports. Can't beat the price for a simple watch."
3,meh,for some reason i thought this watch was steel and got it for my husband for christmas turns out it was plastic so i kept it for myself works great
2,Looses time,"It looks a little cheaper than in the picture. But I shouldn't expect much for $11.00 and free shipping. It does loose about 5 minutes a week but for a ""work"" watch that may get damaged it serves the purpose."
4,Great little watch,"Simple, sexy and elegant. I love this watch. it is easy to slide over the wrists and doesnt scratch or irritate me in any way. Im considering buying another from this stable."
2,Casio Men's,"When buying this kind of products I hope you get in a box to protect it and it can look like a good gift. Instead, I received the watch in a plastic bag that makes it looks like a regular produt. Regardless of the price of the watch, at least it would arrive well packed."
3,too small,"I like a small watch,as I've got small hands and wrists, but the band on this watch was so short that I could barely wear it - it now resides in my ""misc."" drawer."
4,Cool watch,"Clean, simple, and under $10. What more should I write. The band is comfortable and I like the size of the watch face. The only potential drawback (although I knew this before I bought it) is that there isn't a date display. Other than that its running fine and looking spiffy. I'd buy it again."
2,Runs fine however,"The watch works like a watch should however the second hand is a little bit off. So lets say the second hand should be hitting the 12, however it actually stops at spots in between numbers instead."
3,Too small,I was very excited about this watch but it's very small. Clock diameter is slightly larger than an American quarter.
4,"Good, cheap watch","I like this watch because it is not too big, is light weight, and cheap. I have two, one with a white face and one black. Both work well. Changing the battery is also very simple."
5,Value for money,I consider the Casio Mens analog watch( MQ24-1E) the best value that is available in the current market. The new purchase is in addition to one I already have and my purchase was to ensure that I can replace that one should I damage or lose it.
2,Metal bracelet is actually black plastic.,"The description says that this is a metal, bracelet-style wristband. It is actually the same black, plastic wristband of a similarly-listed model. Granted, it wasn't any more expensive, so I didn't expect miracles for $15, but still, the description is wrong. The packing slip and the watch both show the MQ24-1E model no., so I didn't get the wrong watch."
2,An Okay Watch...But Don't Expect Compliments,"I purchased this watch based on Amazon reviews and finances. I needed a something to compliment my business attire for my job. When I finally received the watch, it wasn't what I expected! It looks small on my wrist, and the band looks cheap (like a plastic, cereal prize watch). The faceplate looks nice, but too small for a man. I can't complain too much because it was only $10 (shipping included). This is an alright casual watch, but don't wear it and expect to get compliments!"
2,This picture is misleading,"If you take a good look at this picture the watch doesn't look plastic, I purchased several of these watches and the watches wasn't what I expected at all the watch should say little kids plastic watch. The size of the wrist band was so little as if this was made for a kid to wear. I felt so bad to pass these watches out to anyone. I just donated them to a toys for kids toy box at a local store."
3,okay watch,My watch came a day late then it was suppose too. It was smaller than i thought it was going to be and in the box literally it came just with the watch nox box for the watch or anything. Not what i expected but im giving it 3 starts because you get what you pay for so i guess it wasnt really a rip off.
2,This is a baby watch,This is very small and cannot fit on a males hand more like a baby i was very disappointed in it wont buy again
4,Awesome cheap watch,"I got exactly what I paid for so I can't complain about anything. Very simple, clean looking watch that goes with just about anything. For 10 bucks (I think that's how much I paid for it) everyone should get this watch."
2,Too Cheap,"Ive bought plastic casio watches before. I have the f91-w which is around the same price. I wanted an analog and since ive been pleased with the f91-w watch for a while i thought id give this a try. I dont mind plastic or not looking expensive, but the plastic band on this watch is just so thin and with out any appeal whatsoever. It looks like you bought it at a dollar store, or out of a coin machine. Opt for another model"
2,Waste of money. Cheaply made,It's a dull looking watch with light body and small dial. May be okay for kids but they too like it.
5,Nice watch.,"I'm very glad with this watch.It is cheap, nice looking, and fits perfectly.Bought it for everyday use, very comfortable."
2,This product did not come in a watch box!,I bought 2 of these watches as gifts. The watches are nice but they came in little clear plastic bags. How am I supposed to give these as a gift? Normally watches come in a watchbox. It would be ok if they were for myself but not as a gift!
3,good but know what it doesn't have,"good, but know that it doesn't have night light, date. If that's ok with you, then go for it. but, I had to buy another one - digital - because of my needs for those function."
4,good watch for price,"good watch, works well, the only complaint is that the wrist band is small. I do not have large wrists, but still have to use the next to last hole on the band. It probably won't fit if you have large hands / wrists."
3,Nice watch for a lady's writst,"The watch is nice and appealing but the strap is very small, I can wear it at the very largest setting and it is a bit tight. I don't have large wrists fairly average sized."
3,Lilliputian................for the smallest of wrists,"Good news first. OK watch for $10. I bought to wear when working in yard or fishing. Works fine. Ok.............ever read, hear, or see Gulliver's Travels. This watch would be perfect for the race of Lilliputians, a very tiny bunch of people. It is small, really small."
4,Decent Watch,I bought this watch several months ago and it was a nice buy. It feels a little cheap (and very light) when you first get it but it's surprisingly durable. I've got a few scratched in the glass but nothing major. The plastic band seems to have held up well.I'll definitely buy this again!
2,not really,it was really small and flimsy it is good for small kids or for people with really dirty jobs and need something to tell time
2,Cheap construction. A more durable watch is worth the money,"I just received it. It works fine (for the last 5 hours).But it is light for a reason. It is made of really, really cheap material. It is pretty clear that the strap or watch is going to shatter the first time I accidentally hit a door or a table.If you want something that will still be on your hand when you want to check the time, please consider spending a few dollars more and buying something more durable."
4,Cheap and functional!,"I wanted something sleek and functional and this watch fits the bill. It's also at a great price point that when my first one disappeared (it was a gift), I was able to get another without fretting too much. Recommend!"
5,Classic looking watch,Match this watch with a black and gold band and you have a wonderful looking watch for less than $25. This is my second watch - the first one died after many years of service. Wish it had an alarm.
2,Small,This watch is tiny cheap it looks small on my two year old cousin it made a good gift for him but other than that i was very dissapointed if small is what your looking for than it was pretty fast shipping it still feels very cheap not worth ten bucks.
2,Small!,This watch was very tiny/thin. Not what I was expecting. But Amazon's excellent return policy saved the day. I would recommend this only for a
2,Too small,It looked bigger in the picture... I ended up giving it to my mom because it looked like a girls watch and the size was too small for me. Oh well atleast it was cheap.
1,batteries not working,"this is an objective review of the product i recently purchased,the casio analog watch looked great i would really love to wear one unfortunately its not working so i returned it and was replaced amazingly fast by amazon but the replacement is still not working so amazon refunded my money but i have to remind them via email before amazon actually refunded them.so better pass on this watch and always check your bank balance to make sure your money is refunded.hope this review will help others.thanks."
1,Wrong instructions and wrong packaging,Watch seems to be fine. It had the wrong packaging and wrong instructions. The watch was paired with items from another watch. Someone didn't have their coffee that morning.
5,High praise!,"I have this set as well as the one cup with the lid. I use them all regularly, and continue to be pleased with them. The cups all nest together, so storage is not difficult."
5,No House collection is complete without this CD.,"A perfect mix of hard house and trance. Close your eyes and you can see the lights, feel the people jumping around you. Powerful."
4,A good one to own.,"Its not the best monstrous compendiums i have (which is a lot) but it has plenty of useful monsters which can be used in any campaign (particularly the grung which I think is a much less stupid looking bullywug)some like the grung a modified versions of old monsters which can be used to add a little variety to a campaign. Such modifiers include the Sword wraith, sons of kyuss, norker, Greyhawk dragon, giant iguana, dragonnel, and quickling."
4,Skarie's First book!,"I am a bit biased here,... This is quite the fantasy novel, it does not have any of the powder-puff type romance feel to it, nor does it have the bloody sword and sorcery. The storyline flows fluid through the book, and a plot that kept me from putting the book down for hours until I realized I needed to eat something. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is fan of true fantasy novels rather than sword and sorcery or fantasy/romance."
2,5-star Shrimp Cocktail Glass,"If the product was called a ""Shrimp Cocktail Glass"" or ""Pudding serving glass"", it would get 5 stars. However, as a martini glass, it is a bit of a failure. The glass is really bulky. Handling it and drinking out of it is like eating after a trip to the dentist where Novocaine was administered. The double walled construction will keep the drink cool for longer than a regular glass, but the trade-off isn't worth it. This is not a good martini glass."
2,not like the others,this glass is not crystal and is not like the rest of the set. it it thick & ugly. I was very upset when I opened up the box. I thought there were 2 glasses & there is only one & it is hugh. not a pretty glass. there other glasses in the set and they are light weight & really pretty. this one glass is ugly.
5,great customer service,"Martini glass had a flaw, but replaced it promptly and courteously, is beautiful and fun to drink from."
2,"Wrong item, too",I also received the wrong item when I ordered this George Bush doll. They sent me the Hillary Clinton version of the toy -- I wondered if it was an intentionally switch. :) I'm going to try again and see what happens.
5,The perfect tube?,"Imagine, autofocus through an extension tube! This one is just the write size to give you the little extra close focus for copy work or nature photos. Highly recommended! Of course, if you opt for the longer tubes expect lens focus to become irrelevant, you will have to move the camera and use focus confirmation to help out."
2,Not good for wide angle zoom position,"I purchased this extension tube so that I could take close-ups of food using the wide end of my T3i 18-55mm lens. That lens only focuses to 25 cm (9.8"") and in auto focus only to 28cm. But with the tube in place, at the wide end of the zoom I have to bring the camera within a couple of cm to the subject, which is far too close. The only way to use the tube is on the long end of the zoom, which removes the effect I was working to: the exaggerated foreground.Note too that this lens does not speak to the camera when the tube is installed: you have to manually focus and manually set iris, both of which are relatively easy to do with Magic Lantern installed on the camera.With great regret I am returning the tube. I will have to try a diopter on the front of the lens, though I fear image degradation."
3,"bought it, returned it...","I've been a fan of Jobim's music for years -- his songs contain so much beauty and emotion, and his influence is (deservedly) widespread. The problem I had with this DVD is that for some reason, he chose to sing the entire show in English -- and does so having to constantly refer to notes lying on his piano. I've long enjoyed listening to his songs sung in the original Portuguese -- I don't speak the language (I know only a few words), but that, to me, is part of the beauty of these songs (and other 'world music' as well). The native language of a song is part of the soul of the work -- when it's 'watered down' for American listeners it takes away so much from the original (at least for me).The musicians are first-rate, the playing and arrangements are fine, and technically (picture and sound) the recording is first-rate. If the language issue isn't an important one to you, then I can recommend this DVD -- it was just too much of a 'deal-killer' for me."
2,Oh what a disappointment,"I own (and love) the laserdisc version (Rio Revisited), so when I saw this version in the store in the DVD format with 5.1 sound, I thought I was buying a sharper, improved product (image and sound). Well, guess again. The image is fuzzy (I believe my laserdisc offers a slightly crisper image) and the 5.1 sound turned out to be tinny.I believe that the technology is out there to provide a better product. Take as an example the new James Bond dvds.Anyway, if you own the laserdisc, stick with it. And lets wait for someone to do this one RIGHT!! Jobim deserves better!!!!"
1,DVD Versions Poor,"I have bought two different DVD versions of this concert and threw them both away because the video and sound quality was abysmal compared to the laser disc version which I transferred to DVD long ago. In general, Laser disc video quality was over-rated, but not its sound quality. It's unfortunate that first time buyers on DVD are hearing and seeing the degradation of what was a terrific performance."
3,Chailly is cool and steady; Bonney is a marvelous soloist,"How odd that the reviewer below who heard this Mahler Fourth in concert believes that Chailly's phrasing and tempos are radically unusual. They're slow and dull, in fact. He also credits Chailly with strong rubato, when in truth no one I know of (Levine, Abbado, Bernstein, Horenstein, Walter, Welser-Most, Boulez) uses less. This is a stright-faced performance which puts literalism ahead of joy or originality. In other words, no surprises.My interest centered on Barbara Bonney's solo in the finale. As I had hoped, it's exquisite. She has a ravishing lyric-coloatura soprano that she uses for wide-ranging expression and nuance. Bonney doesn't try to sound in the least childlike, but with such engaging singing, I didn't mind. Strangely, Chailly wakes up in the finale and gives us punchy accents and a hectic interlude that interrupts the generally slow tempo he starts with. Nothing becomes his Mahler Fourth like the leaving of it."
5,In my own state of mind,"I was walking around a competitors book store and whoever the employee who had just left for the day had inserted this CD to pipe over the sound system.This is very remniscent for me of...U2, Coldplay, and something from the 80s sound that I can't put my finger on. It's like wine, you detect certain notes of something...but this creation is all his own. And it is unique. I bought the CD before I left the store and have been listening to it all afternoon at work. It takes me back to when I was vacationing in the Netherlands last year....this CD is great!"
5,Satisfied,Product was exactly what I wanted and expected. Delivery was quicker than stated. Completely satisfied.
5,Truly Interesting!,"I'm in my final semester in the Registered Nursing program. Just finished with my Psychiatric Nursing rotation. We used this Keltner text as our mainstay throughout the course. The instructors got together about a semester ago and decided it was time to change textbooks. The instructors decided on this text and I'm forever grateful! I found myself not only using this text to study from, but I found myself actually reading it for fun!?!?!? - and now during summer break, I find myself reading from it. I've now decided on a career in Psychiatric Nursing, based in small part on this text and my experiences during clinical rotation. Thanks Norm for a great book!"
3,Too General,"This book seems like a compliation of several other (really good) books I've read on this subject & just a little too general. Also, religion was infused a little too much & there wasn't enough on the whys & hows of abuse."
4,Good informational source,"On the whole the book was excellent, especially when it comes to photographs of archaeological remains. The only thing I had a problem with, being new to greek warfare, was that to get full use of the book a prior knowledge of Greek basics is needed. This would not be a book I would suggest for the introductory reader. One example of the difficulties is that he speaks of several different groups that make up the ""Spartans,"" but never explains how they relate, who they are, etc. If you are looking for photographs of archaeological remains this is definately a book you can use and if you have a basic background in Greek warfare it will also be helpful in providing good, solid, and authoritative information."
2,Rambling and incoherent,"Frankly, I am disappointed in ""The Spartan Army"". Yes, there is some interesting information about the Spartan's, some I haven't read of before, but the author writes in a kind of haphazard rambling fashion that makes it difficult to extract the information. The author starts describing some aspect of Spartan life and then, just as it's becoming interesting, veers off to some other seemingly unconnected topic. It reads like a high school English class essay that the author threw together at the last minute."
4,"Smells good, but put in cool place.","The product smells wonderful and is very light, absorbs well. I would recommend you leave it in fridge, if you live in humid climate, because I found the cream turned moldy after a while."
4,Add some info!!!!!!,"Excellent photographies, but why didn't the editors add some info about all the models ?"
1,Boy Soldiers/ His Masters Ghost,"Dear Amazon:I have made numerous buys from your site in the past I do not know were this particular copy came from.. First it was wrapped in a loose cellophane wrapping, when I opened it to play it, it was scratched.. I am not impressed, also the label on the front of the DVD says it's a double feature.. However when you play back the DVD only one movie is displayed.. It appears as though someone burnt one movie on a blank DVD and packaged it in an original commercial case this DVD has no double feature. I want this particular purchase reviewed by Amazon officials, and to please E-mail me back on how I can return this possible pirated DVD Thank You!!"
4,"Sun, Sand & Surf Tunes","Except for the overplayed and over-rated Don't Worry Be Happy-which was entertaining maybe the first 10-15 times I'd heard it years ago, this is a fun collection of summertime party music. Whether stretched out in your yard, on the porch or on the beach, this is a really good collection of tunes. For more fun, get Sun Splashin' vol.2. Wish there was a volume 3. Anyway, despite that one song, this comes highly recommended."
5,Fun in the Sun AGAIN,Received product promptly and in condition as stated. Now my wife can once again cruise with the top down and enjoy the tunes till she wears this one out! Thanks
5,Absolutely Exciting to Read!!,First of all I can't wait for the next books!! I found this story moved me along easily and I was immediately interested in the characters! I related to the mother I am sorry to say and found the Ahriman character a sexy and cool villian. So many emotions came out of me while reading the story and as soon as I finished I wanted more. It also prompted me to do some reading in the Bible with an interest in the history of the spear of destiny which I have seen mentioned in other movies. The Magician is something I would love to see in movie form. I loved it and am anxious to finish the series. Can't believe this is the author's first book! Very interesting plot!
5,My Lil Super Buddy,You will not be mad u purchased the DN S1000 this product is compact and very very very on point effects and all. I love it easy to learn practice a bit and you will be ready on fire like me................I Had a set for 2 years and they go hard....
5,Celtic Dreams -- dreamy!,"My introduction to O'Carolan - cheerful, beautifulcompositions - I once thought the dulcimer wasuninteresting, but this whole CD is totally addictive,some soft and mellow, some enchanting and upbeat. I gotCarolan's Cup too and that is also great, but as areviewer before me said, different mix of instruments.Now I've capitulated and ordered Carolan's Cottage.Joemy Wilson is a wonderful interpreter of O'Carolan."
5,Insight Into Star Wars Folly,"I am certain that the reviewers who gave this book a one star rating have not read the book for they offer no specifics which indicate they are familiar with its detailed,well researched contents. Had they done so objectively, they would have had a hard time downrating this extraordinary work. Those who approach the book with an open mind will find this an illuminating account of President Reagan's naivete about the Star Wars project as well as a telling recitation of our former President's style of hands off governing.In my mind, this is the best book on Reagan's presidency and his true legacy as an uninvolved leader who seemed to live in a world of cinematic fantasy."
2,This book is misguided,"This book tries to blame president reagan for spending so much money on the SDI program. The problem is that it tries to blame him for wasting money on something he knew wouldn't work. I don't feel that is an honest account. He thought that he could work, just like going to the moon was a dream that people dismissed. Technology expands quickly, and I am always amazed by breakthroughs that I see. To blame Reagan for wasting money is accurate, to blame him as the book did is misguided. This book is obviously written by a Reagan-hater who only wanted to push book sales to the liberal community. I wish the writer stuck to the facts and presented readers with the tools to make their own decisions. But that is not why the writer wrote this book, sad."
5,Better than Dutch,"At 592 pages, this book was more about Reagan himself, althought the context was the Star Wars project and the Cold War. I wanted to read it though because from browsing a few pages of the book in the bookstore, I knew that the book could not be any worse than Dutch, a poorly written book that should be displayed only as an example of what not to do when writing a presidential biography. Although the author does poke fun at the monumental waste of Star Wars, a small comfort to me and my spent tax dollars, the author does give the Reagan credit for winning the Cold War. There a lot of interesting stories in this book that you cannot find in the dry history textbooks my child complains about reading. The prose is crisp and clean and the author stays on track. In short, Way Out There in the Blue is a book with substance and content that most anyone can read. I hope you find it as entertaining as I did."
4,Expansive and well written,"This book was about far more than Star Wars. Fitzgerald also gets into US foreign policy with the Soviet Union and the demise of the USSR. This is not a light book: it is thick and excellently researched with great references. There is no doubt the book backs up the liberal perspective on all of topics, however, as I've mentioned, she backs up everything she says. I have no problem with people disagreeing with her - just be as thorough in your disagreements. PEACE."
5,Eye opening study of the end of the cold war.,"The coalescence of several improbable dynamics ended the cold war; the cult of personalty in American politics, the verve and risk-taking of Gorby, and the public penchant for a quick fix for the nuclear nightmare. As revealing of human nature as Gravity's Rainbow or Catch-22, only funnier."
1,Poorly written and ideologically biased,"Of all the books written on the Reagan administration, this one may be one of the worst. Poorly written with excessive attention to detail that makes the story plod, it makes one wonder if Frances Fitzgerald was a one hit wonder. Fitzgerald's portrayal of Reagan as out of step with reality - starting with the book title and included throughout its content - is less of a description of reality and more, I suspect, the blowing off of ideological steam. If you despise Reagan and think he was a dunderhead this book will do more than reinforce those beliefs. If you want an intelligent and useful discussion of the Reagan Administration and its foreign policy walk right past this one."
1,Tired Anti-Reagan propaganda from the Left - AGAIN.,"Ms. Fitzgerald, while a skilled writer, is apparently incapable of logical thought processes when it comes to evaluating a conservative political figure, which she obviously views with disdain, along with many of her leftist friends. This book is simply the latest salvo in the relentless battle being waged by the Left to discredit Ronald Reagan and his policies. More tired references to Reagan's purported ""simplemindedness"", his ""fixation on fantasy"", and ""mysterious inability to relate emotionally to his own family"". As if Ms. Fitzgerald has any way of knowing this to be the case! This book is poorly researched, riddled with factual errors, and laughably obvious in its attempt to smear Ronald Reagan and belittle his accomplishments as President. His record speaks for itself, no matter how hard his opponents attempt to rewrite history. Don't waste your money on this trash."
1,Me think Book good,"Me think book good. LIberals smart, conservatives dumb, me think liberals better then Regan, stoopid Regan, not smart like liBarels, Francies Fitsjerald smart, jest like cuzzin in Arkansaw who maried sister, liBiarals smart."
1,(...)drivel,"Let me save you the time and money you might have spent on this book. The premise is: Reagan was soooo stupid that it was only his inability to tell the difference between US foreign policy and B grade movies he starred in 40 yrs earlier that led him to push for SDI. The premise that Reagan was stupid is contradicted by the work: Reagan in His Own Hand...and is standard liberal drivel ie: I am sooo right and sooo enlightened that whoever disagrees with me must be stupid.You don't need to go to the opposite extreme in defending Reagan, but this book is a collection of the author's self-righteous prejudices, and all her ""facts"" are used only to confirm her original diagnosis that she, and her readers, and others like her, are smarter than Reagan and really did know how to handle the Soviet Union, unlike Reagan who bundled through foreign policy (and life) like Inspector Clusseau on a case."
1,The Author is a Fool,"The author is clueless. Saw her on History channel interview. She stated that any laser weapon that can be used for knocking out missiles in space can be equally effective against ground targets - like people. This demonstrates her incompetence. She obviously doesn't know the first thing about propagation physics, like the fact that WHERE the phase distortions occur drives weapon effectiveness. Fact: A space-to-ground scenario would result in both linear and nonlinear effects such as turbulence and thermal blooming in the far feild. Such phase distortions cannot be corrected because where they are sensed and corrected differs from where they are generated. This woman is a fool and so are those who believe her."
1,rubbish,"The author misses the point. The point is not whether SDI was technically feasible. The point is that the Soviets BELIEVED it was feasible. And it scared the daylights out of them. As long as the arms race was waged on a purely quantitative basis, the Soviets could hang in the game. Once the equation became both Quality AND quantity, the game was soon over. Gorbachev (among others) knew this; hence, his zeal to persuade Reagan to drop SDI at the Iceland summit."
4,Great story - book needs work,"A great story about the Miracle Dog - heartfelt and emotional. The book itself could use some reorganization and definitely needs someone to spell and grammar check it. Was disappointed with the quality of the copy, but the story was too good to not give 4 stars to."
5,Excellent Book!!,"This is a MUST READ for anyone that's involved in animal rescue, shelter work and animal control. It's also good for just about anyone who has compassion for animals. This dog's will to survive is incredible!"
5,Great book by Randy Grim.,A must read book about what euthanised animals go through. Randy Grim has another winner. I love this book & i've read it several times.
5,GREAT FREESTYLE MIX,I collect freestyle music[specially mixed] and this is one of my favorites.Great mix when one hit finish and the other start.Please help me to find more mixes like this because it's hard to find here in P.R.
1,It wasn't what I ordered!,"I was looking for a charger for my Iphone but mine has an Otterbox Defender case on it so I have to be particular about type of charger I buy (not all iphone chargers will fit with my case on) I bought this one specifically because the picture showed a slim 30 pin dock. When it came in the mail, it was not the one I ordered, and no it DID NOT FIT!"
5,the best book ever written !,When I bought this book I didn't expect to be blown away like this ! I can't believe what I got ! Magic and amusement. I am currently running up and down the streets of Staten island screaming the title of this book while you are reading this. If you choose to purchase this book all your wildest fantasies will come true....promise
3,Last Day Delivery,"I did order two copies of the Gasparilla Cookbook. Contrary to experience with other book sellers, the books arrived on the very last day of the delivery window. They arrived with dust jackets in place and, although visably old, appeared to be in very good shape. However, upon removal of the dust jacket, the spine on one copy came apart and the other was already complete off. In light of the price I paid ($1.00 per copy + shipping), I am still pleased with my purchase but would like to have known the true condition of the books in advance of ordering."
5,The best cook book for all receipes.,I have had the Gasparill cookbook since 1968. The pages are well worn and my book is taped togather. My husband loves the lemon pie receipe on page 256. I have made it with other fruit also and it is still good.
5,Simply Delish,"This cookbook is simply wonderful! I love the wide variety of recipe's and how easy they are to prepare. On a fun note, it is always neat that I have the same cookbook that Jackie Kennedy was photographed carrying!"
3,Very dainty and light lavender color,"They are pretty and since they were on sale and have a 14kt gold setting, I'm satisfied. Be sure to read the dimensions so that you are not disappointed in their small size. I hoped they would be the rich purple color pictured but they are much lighter in color. The setting is raised and seems very sturdy. They do not look cheap and are easily visible on the earlobe for a conservative classic look. I will likely order the pendant necklace when it goes on sale again."
3,Consistent Misrepresentation,"We have purchased several gemstone earrings from Amazon. *Every* time we received stones that were much paler than what was advertised. We think Amazon is a very rare ""A+"" merchant -- for everything but jewelry. Sorry to say we can not recommend Amazon jewelry."
3,Not exactly as pictured,"Very nice earrings, BUT not nearly as blue as picture, they are more of a faded out blue color. I will keep them anyway, but picture should closer match what you actually receive."
5,Great gems!,I am fully satisfied with these ones. They are perfectly well finished and gems shine quite good. They are simply perfect and cost/value is amaizing.
4,Full edition,"Would like to read full version to better comment, intend to buy it as soon as possible. Oustanding revelations of North American history, need to read more about colonial epoch... But in all a great book"
2,Teachers Beware!,"If you are an instructor and intend to use the teaching edition as an aid, be prepared to do lots of legwork yourself. At the end of each chapter there are exercises in the form of questions, concrete to abstract, that you can use. However, no suggested answers are provided. In my mind, when I purchase a teaching addition, there is an implication that the heavy lifting will be done by the authors. That's what they get paid for. The teaching edition is a disappointment and a ripoff considering the fact that I had already purchased an edition of the Zinn book."
2,Unbalanced Overall,"This is a pretty unbalanced and simplistic book that only roots-out the truth in a very superficial manner. Historians will certainly dismiss the method here and find many conclusions laughable. Some of the historical interpretation left me stunned. The truth _is_ hard to take but the truth here remains well hidden beneath scores of inaccuracies, discounted mythology, and baseless personal rants. Extremely silly stuff and highly attractive to the uninformed conspiracy nut to whom it should be dedicated."
1,Far Left History,"I was so excited to get this book to use for home school history class, but when we got into the book we discovered that the subject matter was so far left that it was offensive to us. It may be fine for some, but not for middle of the road or conservative people. This author made wonderful projects to do, but the text was not applicable to high school juniors in my case."
5,Most fascinating US history book I have ever read,"It doesn't matter how boring you thought history was when you were in school, after reading Zinn's book you will see US history through different eyes. This book looks at US history through the eyes of its victims: Indians, slaves, laborers, women, immigrants, soldiers, the labor movement, pacifists, etc. You don't understand this country today until you understand how we got here."
1,"Seriously, do not buy this book","Let's put it this way, I threw this book in my hotel room garbage pail two days into my trip to Milan. Two major reasons: 1) Ancient, incorrect information - does no one fact check this book? I actually wasted time looking for several places that no longer existed (and I later learned, had not existed for some time!). 2) Many places she recommends are helplessly outdated and tragic. Unless you are over 65, you will not find these stores at all fashionable. If you are looking for the latest & greatest in Milan shopping, well, rest assured you will not find it in this book. For the love of god, don't waste your money."
4,won't leave home without it,"Just returned from a fab trip to Rome, and it was all the better for having Suzy's book with me. She was accurate about many of the stores (Francesco Rogani did lock the door while I was there), and having the addresses handy was helpful, as I don't speak Italian and sometimes have trouble reading the handwriting. From now on all I need to travel is one of Suzy's books, and a MapEasy's Guidemap!"
1,Don't bother!,"Don't bother buying this book. First, none of the Born To Shop books get updated much between editions, so lots of information is out of date. Second, Suzy Gershman is totally out of touch with reality. I took a shopping tour to Italy with a company called Shop Around Tours and obviously a lot of us had this book. The tour leader warned us not to pay too much attention to it and she was right. BUT we went to Mantero, which is one of the places mentioned in the book, and it was great. Otherwise, the people that went off on their own following Suzy's wild goose chases were very disappointed. So the shopping in Italy was great, but this book was a waste of money."
1,Full of inaccuracies,"Suzy Gershman needs to retire already. All of her books, including this one, are full of inaccuracies. Each edition is barely updated, so there's no need to buy the new version if you have an old one. It's time Frommers dropped Gershman and hired someone under the age of 70 to update these books that shops NOW and knows what they're talking about. These Born To Shop books are an amusing read but a complete waste of money if you're looking for current information."
2,A lot of errors,"This guide gives a lot of information but some glaring errors. The Etro factory is in Milan not in Como, Pavia is a city south of Milan and not in Tuscany etc. I also do not necessarily want to know about the authors hot flashes while trying on cashmere sweaters.Ann Dexter, Rome"
3,Mixed review,"The book is good, but it depends on what type of shopping you are looking for. If you are interested in designer clothing and where to find the outlets, then this is the book for you. I was more interested in finding information on the local crafts for each part of Italy I traveled to. While the book did touch upon this, the emphasis was more on designer clothes, bags, shoes, etc. Note that the book also covers hotel info, and it is already a small book to begin with."
4,Great Music from great bands!!,"This album is once again a great one from Dexter and the crew at Nitro Records. A.F.I get the space htey deserve as do Guttermouth and The Vandals...they are all great songs, and their is even a limited edition Offspring song from a special cd they released to members of their fan club!! Great songs.....(especially 'Cafe 405' and 'If only the gvmnt could read my mind')"
4,Hossam Ramzy returns to form!,"I had about given up on Hossam Ramzy because he seemed to have fallen into a rut and a blah rut at that. With this album, he breaks out with a fresh, fun dancable sound. I thoroughly enjoy every track on this CD. Lots of fun to listen to, and hard not to dance to."
4,Biblical Hebrew,The text included a study workbook and CD. I used the text for my Access to Biblical Hebrew class and am now using the workbook to review what I learned in class.
2,dull and hard to read,"This watch is a big disappointment. It has no night light or glowing hands, and the hands are far too slim.Other than these drawbacks, it's O.K. for $10.00"
1,Great watch if you can get one that runs,"I bought two watches and neither one of then ran, sent them back and got two morebut only one of them ran. After sending the one that didn't run back and receivinganother one I finally had two that ran. Five watches to get two that worked."
1,Battery Life,"The Casio Mens MQ24-1B is a very stylish watch for the the price. The battery life is very short. The first one I brought lasted about 6 months, and the second one lasted for 2 months. I will reorder, different style this time, because Casio is the only company I could find that carry prison approved watches for inmates."
2,Didn't have much time to enjoy it,"3 days after I received the product, I discovered the battery had died. Very disappointed to say the least."
4,Great watch,Great watch. I had ordered several of the white face and think that this black face is not as easy to see the hands but I like how thin it is on your wrist.
5,Simple great Watch,This is the perfect simple watch for me.I dont need alot and it doesnt do alot. Perfect match we have. It does tell me what time it is.This watch is an excellent value; durable and attractive. For less than ten dollars you cant go wrong with the great black watch.
5,Great watch,"I use it every day, it goes with casual and formal clothes. I'm usually walking in the street, when I used watches more fancy I was worried not to get assaulted ja :D we can say this Casio watch has a low profile. It does what a watch should do: it tells you the time. The screen is made of plastic and I believe it has a very good battery performance, I purchased it on May and I haven't changed the battery. Pretty good watch for me."
4,Does the job.,"I was unsure when I first thought of buying it after reading through reviews. In the end, I ordered one, and it wasn't too bad.Pros:It works! It's also pretty stylish. It's not the top-of-the-line of its kind, but you get what you pay for.Cons:Battery life and the rubber strap feels like with a simple tear, the entire strap can be ruined."
1,Too Damn Small,Too small. I am not a huge guy but its just too small. Sending this Piece of crap back immediately.
2,Rather weak for a 20 sheet stapler,10 sheet stapler would be more accurate for this machine. I end up with a lot of bent staples on my copies because it just won't do very many pages. There must be much better deals out there than this model. Can't recommend this one.
1,Defect or Bad Quality??,"We purchased the item on JUL/15/09 and received it around JUL/20/09. Only a week after our staff using the machine, they reported that the machine sometimes very loud when they stapled the paper, even lesss than 10 pages. Then, the condition was getting worse and worse. The persentage of loudness and paper jam were getting to 70%.We have to return the item to manufactory."
4,Reliable if you are sensible,"Heavy Duty and automatic staplers are just notoriously difficult to get right. That's because the nature of the staple makes them so easy to jam. This Panasonic is the least troubling and most reliable of the kind. You must exercise care and maintain the thing: no heavy-duty staples, no over-loading.(If you routinely staple 20 sheets, then a 20-sheet stapler is by definition not good enough, since you are maxing out it's capabilities constantly! This one works great and, because it is attached under your desk with a wire, it cannot be easily stolen.-Milton"
1,Worked great till it broke - Bad design destined to fail - Flimsy,"Each time this stapler jams or misses, it bends the mechanism that pushes the staple. Once it bends enough then it starts to really jam and bend itself worse. I have opened mine and fixed it a few times, but now it is beyone repair.Once you bend the bar inside, it's only a matter of time before it becomes useless.If you are very carefull using it from day one, it might last you. If you shoot a second staple after a jam, that's what starts the trouble.I just threw mine out. For the money they charge, it's really poorly designed and made. This is probably the only Panasonic product I have ever not been happy with, and I have bought a lot of them.I have the Swingline 520e and it NEVER jams, I never have any problem with it. It does take proprietry staples but it works like a charm.Smitty"
3,"Typical Foster, but a bit slow","When a powerful wizard is destroyed during a war, his burial ashes transform his pets into human form. They must then travel into a rainbow in search of white light, in order to break a curse placed over the land.As usual Alan Dean Foster has a vivid imagination and manages to think up some very interesting and unique characters/worlds. His writing is good, and I enjoyed the characterization of the six animals. I found this particular story, however, to be a bit slow and continued reading the book just to finish it."
4,Before the Dawn,While it is probably true that the author is not an offical Navy Seal I found the book to be an excellent look into the life of Vietnam veterans. I have met one of the people mentioned in the book; Dave Roever. He was definetly injured as listed in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the war and particularly the effects of war.
3,Before the Dawn,"Micky was a highly decorated combat disabled veteran who served in the Riverine. Some of the training was at Coronado Island and that is where the SEAL team does a portion of their training. It is too bad that so many that went through Coronado like to consider themselves as SEAL team members. That is the main flaw in the book. Bill Kimball has helped several veterans write their story and has done a very fine job. Micky is a personal friend and I feel bad about this, as he served his country above and beyond his call."
5,English Translations of the Non-English Song Titles,"In order to at least comprehend the meaning of the non-English song titles, here are the English translations of the non-English song titles:1. Wunder gescheh'n( Miracles Happen )2. Du bist ueberall( You Are Everywhere )3. Hero( English Title )4. Schlaflied( Sleeping Song/Song for Sleeping )5. Weisses Schiff( White Ship )6. Im Rausch der Liebe( In the Rapture/Ecstasy of Love )7. La Vie C'est La Chance( Life Is Opportunity )8. Keine Langeweile( No Boredom )9. Steht auf( Stand Up/Get Up )10. Abschied( Farewell/Parting )"
3,Not Bad At All,"I like Nena a lot, so i'm afraid that i will not be too objective. Nena has been great and she'll always be. Regarding this album; album is softer than the others but contains some great stuff."
5,Phat!,Really cute mix... touches on the filterd disco sound that was big in the UK about a year ago. If your into this stuff it's the CD you WANT to own!
2,A little Science and much Speculation,"The Author mentions some hard science about the olfactory aspects of sex. However, the author often uses words such as ""may"" and""possibly"" and so much of the book consists of honest and informed speculative commentary. Probably nine out of ten people who pick up this book are looking for a list of aphrodiasiac (ok, we know they don't exist) or near-aphrodiasiac scents, and that takes a lot of reading to find what could fill a page. (The answers are Pumpkin Pie and Vanilla and a few others.) This is a genuinely scientific book, pitched at the high-school level of intellectual accomplishment."
1,The book coud be condensed to a one-page paper.,"If you want to fresh-up the sexual side of your realationship, or you want to succesfully build a new one - do not waste time for a pop-science of this kind. You will find it really interesting, but not many of the questions I had were answered. The answeres I did find did not convince me."
2,"very difficult, frustrating","I purchased this set for my seven year old who is a lego fan, I thought it looked great and difficult to find such a model. However, when he tried to put it together it was very difficult for him because the instructions weren't clear enough, he ended up leaving it unfinished. Whereas, he can easiliy built the lego set ment for 12 yr old. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Gorgeous but poor presentation,"As I have mentioned in other jewelry reviews, Amazon jewelry is hard to beat from a price point of view and this is no exception - unfortunately a velvet bag is in place of a nice little box and the chains are always in a twisted mess."
5,Very nice,"Very nice overall, the pendant was the main attraction, nice size, simple but still elegant. The chain is very delicate and will have to be replaced as I expected. Very pleased she's happy I'm happy! Funny how that works."
5,Detailed step-by-step,"GoLive in 24 is very well structured. It is one of the best detailed ""24 hour"" books I have read. It also has a great support website with resource files. GoLive is not an easy program to ""pick-up"" and this book really gets you going on the right track. It covers both basic and powerful techniques."
2,Excellent Teaching Methods,"I found this book immensely helpful since I was switching from Frontpage to GoLive. GoLive is definitely ""industrial strength"" and the paradigm of this program is significantly different from Frontpage. This book really helped me understand the logic of the GoLive program. There is a reason for all the pallettes, toolbars and the way the program is laid out. This book really facilitated a painless process in understanding the program...which is absolutely essential in order to take advantage of all the great features of GoLive. The explanation of metatags and how they are used in search engines is very helpful and everything you need to know to easily build them into your site is explained in the book. I definitely recommend Sams Teach Yourself Adobe GoLive 5 for beginners to intermediate professionals...I would consider myself an intermediate website builder."
5,A! Tops!,"This is the best Go Live 6 book I have read. It is clear, concise, and get's you up and running quickly. I would reccomend it to anyone!"
5,If you only get one book on Las Vegas...,"Great deal of info, particularly in the areas of planning and saving money, finding the cheapest deal, etc. Great overview and opinionated review of hotels, restaurants, buffets, casino, etc., and a good general intro to all the casino games. Areas that are just a tad weak: Comps (or freebie's for players), lighter weight treatment of outlying casinos that aren't on the Strip or downtown, and perhaps a little bit out of date for this fast-changing city. But despite all these the book is highly recommended."
3,LOA: Back to their Roots,"After breaking up a little over a year ago, the Brooklyn based band has released a compiation of some rare and live stuff. If you are big fan of the band this is a must. It contains some early demos that show what helped make the band such a promenient part of the New City Hardcore scene. Theres a great cover of an SOD tarck, and some live stuff that features stuff from the 2nd album, ""Ugly"". If you missed the old school style of this band, than I suggest this as good album to add to you LOA collection."
3,"excellent ""work""","this untalented music is just pleasure to listen to. i dropped two stars from a perfect because its unfair that such simple songs sound so good and because ""River Runs Red"" is better. and ""soul searching sun"" has better production. check out among thieves (new band with alan and one or two other former LOA members) they are very good sounding (mixture of old school and clean non-nauseating vocal styles) i only heard among thieves on cable metal radio (1 song) they are excellent. avoid keith's solo work if you dont appreciate sara mclachlan and paula cole."
4,Hardcore at its Best,A life of agony you never heard before.Coffee break is just one of the high lights of the album. You got to have it if your a true fan.I love LOA even if they wrote piano music I still love'em. To sum it up its heavy and raw the way it should be.
3,1989-1999 Agony is Ruff,"Finally some new Agony. This disc contains nothing with the singer from Ugly Kid Joe(Thank God). Kieth on all vocals. This cd is a must have for any LOA fan. If you like River Runs Red this Cd is for you. It has some early stuff that is really raw and heavy. Joey Z's guitar playing is noticable on this disc. There are some demos that never made cds because the songs are not the best. There are also a few live tracks. Its a shame these guys broke up, I definately seeing them getting back together."
4,Great Time Piece- with one caveat,"I purchased this for every day use, as well as a basic dive time and depth back up to my computer. It is a very well made and functional watch, and it looks very sharp. After figuring out how to work the various functions (as my wife reminds me often, ""read the manual, dumb ass"") I am thoroughly impressed. The only complaint I can up with is the band length. Obviously I can wear it when I am not wearing any exposure protection, but being in Minnesota I typically dive dry or with a 7 MM Wetsuit, even in the summer. Good luck trying to get the watch on when you are suited up in a thick Wetsuit and gloves or with any kind of Drysuit with a suitable undergarment. To that end, I wish they would have included a band extender with the watch v. having to buy one. That's it, otherwise it is a great watch.Good diving!Tim"
5,Citizen's Aqualand Watch,The watch is an excellent choice! Great for the outdoors with nice features. I love it that I will not have to replace bateries ever!!!
2,Surprisingly low quality,"I bought the watch few years back and have used it occasionally, both when diving and on land. This is not my primary watch. What I like about it is the fact that I don't need to send it back to Citizen for very costly battery changes at least once every year (as I did with my previous Citizen watch on normal battery). I had misplaced the watch a while back in a box and it was dead when I found it. A few hours under the sun, however, made it tick again. Great!I was very disappointed to see the crown come off a few month back, when I was changing the date. I haven't bothered checking how much it would cost to repair yet."
1,Bad Expectation,It was not what I was expecting for. It doesn't represent what I though. I really got disappoint with it. I am not using it. It is not what I want it to be. It looks much better on the page than on real. I do not recommend it. I would like to return it and get my money back.
2,Did not stand up to my needs,Great looking watch. Only lasted 6 years though. Movement needed replacement. Not cheap to have repaired. Citizen quoted me $188.00 for fix the problem. Not a happly camper right now. I would stay clear on this series and go with a more durable one.
2,Grab Your Pillow,"This book was poorly translated from French and it showed in the text. There are many grammatical errors and the information lacks any logical path, there is no main point in the book. I was greatly disappointed with this text. I do not recommend this book."
3,Gitzo G11510N - Microphone holder,"The Gitzo G11510N Mic holder is an economical way to mount your shotgun mic and minimise noise in the recording. It is excellent for indoor use or outdoor with no wind but if there is any wind a furry wind screen or even better, a zepplin is needed. Good for film makers who are starting out. BE WARNED - this is not with the boom pole. You need to get that extra.For $70 it's OK so get out and record that sound track for your next film.Franki, Film maker"
5,Does as advertised.,"Many have complained that the burn you receive from using this product is unbearable, this is however completely untrue. I've used this product for sometime now and never have I had any problems. It removes all ""redness"" from the eyes, in fact they're so clear after use that I have actually received compliments :)! Sure... there's a slight burn (not uncommon in eye-drops), but after the burning subsides (like 15 seconds) my eyes feel cool and refreshed."
5,Rohto v-ice eye drops,I'm truly surprised at the negative reviews here. A drop in each eye is all you need. The sting that's referred to lasts two seconds and is mild. I cant imagine why some peoples reactions to the drops were so negative and some so great. Mine was great and i hope it never leaves the market.
1,My eyes basically looked to same after using them,"Basically what the title says and its does not burn like everyone is making it out to be.. There is a slight burn, but nothing you cant get over after a couple seconds. I might try the top one, the artics is what there are called..Maybe the ice are to weak for me.."
3,Eyedrops,"I have used Rohto eye drops from Japan before, so I was looking for the same product, and this one was the closest I could find. I am pleased with the product. However, since I use contacts, I have found that I must take my contacts off first to use these eye drops. Otherwise, my eyes burn like crazy and my contacts become even more uncomfortable to wear. With the one from Japan, I could use it with my contacts, so not sure why I can't with this one. I think the burning sensation is a little extreme even if it subsides in a few seconds. It does well to clear redness and give you a glassy, clear view, which I have loved in Rohto brand eye drops. I use it occasionally since I always use my contacts. Any recommendations for Rohto eye drops that can be used with contacts?"
3,Good but not Great,"After trying other products with no success, so I decided to Rohto a try. Initial application burned my eyes and relieved most of the red but not all. Basically no different than most of the red eye relief eye drops provided by other eye drops available over the counter. Still looking for the one that can get rid of the red."
2,The BURN!!,I got this as a free sample and I dont know why they would make it burn so much when you put them in. I didnt see or feel a difference compares to drops from like Visine. I rather not feel it burn when you put them in.
1,"Awful, AWFUL Stuff","It burns your eyes! PLEASE do not buy this. Buy Rohto Cool instead, because Ice is horrible. I just if I had to give it some small shred of credit, it does get rid of redness. But the pain is NOT worth it. Rohto Cool is gentle, gets rid of the red, and feels so great that you actually want to keep putting more in your eyes. Stay away from Rohto Ice!"
1,worst eye drops. ever.,"i wish i cold give negative stars. this is my first review ever. i'm not sure if i have ever felt this strongly about a product before.i was worried maybe i had a contaminated package, but apparently blinding pain is a common side effect of these eye drops. it feels like you have squirted menthol-jalepeno juice into directly into your eye. my eyes immediately starting watering uncontrollably. it reminded me of back in the day when you had multiple contact solutions, and if you forgot to put a neutralizing enzyme in or used the red tipped cleaning solution bottle (that looked identical to the re-wetting drop bottle) your eyes felt like they were awash with acid.granted the intense burning/blinding pain eventually dissipates, but still...."
1,Use a potato peeler instead!,"To fully assess whether you are UP to the challenge of using this product, prior to purchase, simply use an ordinary potato peeler, gouge either eye a bit, insert one Hall's menthol eucalyptus cough drop into eye and enjoy the RELIEF! Simply the worst ocular burning sensation ever."
4,Altoids For The Eyes!,"That title is one of my neew favorite phrases. BzzAgent.com hooked me up with a free sample of Rohto to test out and spread around. I felt like I could *taste* the mint of the eyedrops. With my eyes. Which is weird. But, it's very refreshing. I've tried other eye drops, and they're moisturizing, but I've never felt ones that were so...refreshing! If you're not big on minty things, or altoids kind of scare you away, you may want to steer clear of these. They're strong feeling. And they feel like they energize me (I know, it doesn't make a ton of sense), so I avoid using them before bed."
1,It Stings!,"I have very dry eyes and they stay red all the time. I usually just used the Visine brands but the packaging caught my eye on this one. I've used it about 5-6 times and EVERY time I get this burning, stinging sensation in my eyes, couldn't force my eyes open with a crow bar and the urge to rub my eyes constantly (of course i coudln't resist that urge and think i did more harm to the skin around my eyes from all the rubbing!) I dont know if that is what the reaction is supposed to be, but its very uncomfortable. I have read many GREAT reviews about the Rohto Cool, I may take a chance and give it a try but the Rohoto V ICE is going in the TRASH TODAY!!! Right now matter of fact. I highly recommend to STEER CLEAR OF THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Rohto ice eye drops,"these drops do sting a little but they do relieve redness and dryness. Small word of warning, don't forget they are shipped from America and be prepared for high postage to pay."
3,Great service / O.K. product,"I'm going to take the responsibility here, maybe I didn't read the description thoroughly. I was looking for the eye drops that, when used, cause a burning sensation in the eye for a few seconds, but then leave you with a totally refreshed feeling. The drops I got do not do this. They are only o.k. So if you are looking for the astringent drops, read more carefully then I did. On the other hand, the transaction was flawless."
3,be careful!!,"Be careful product may cause infection. You have to be hyper-hygienic! replace top and use rare, and use just a small quantity."
1,Ouch!,I thought my eye was on fire when I used these eye drops. I can't believe that I wasted money on them.. they are horrible!!!
2,Major problems with caps,"Positives: my 3 and 4 year olds like it.Negatives: major problems with caps. There are two caps to each pen, an inner blue cap to block the end of the tube and a second cover over the entire end. in addition to that there is a nozzle of sorts to direct the glue. either both caps wouldn't come off or when they do come off, the caps stick together inside the outer cap. I had to pry several inner and outer caps apart and cut more than one outer cap to get the nozzle out of it."
5,Little girls dream!!!,"My daughter has been begging me for more glitter glue and I could not find it anywhere. Thanks for this, now she will not run out for a long time and I will have more beautiful glitter creations from my little princess!!"
3,"decent movie, very interesting commentary","Now the movie is nothign special, but does have a few fun weapons. Add in some really good acting and you have a decent movie. The fighting is the thing that slows this film down. It is just slow and doesn't look that good. A few of the fights are fun, but that mainly comes from the acting ability. One man Army, the Devil Ripper, you will see what I mean.Now the thing I found very interesting was the commentary from the people whio originally released in America back in the 70's. They talk A LOT about how they had to cut the film up a ton becasue there was too much dialogue, and they talk about the dubbign extensively. I had almost as good of a time listening to the commentary. So the movie is decent, but the commentary is very interesting for us that want to know how these movies got released, who released them, basically all the info I wanted to know. I couldn't ask for more.The pictrue is letterboxed with very good picture quality."
4,worked fine,it came fast an it worked out fine.. throws good light .. it's a light bulb what is there to say lol
1,not fit to fixture and neither work,"My rating is zero star, the light bulb (GE22181-F382D/835/4p)from Amazon was not able to fit or click into light fixture, both me and my electrician try to put in light fixture in twice (2 new light bulbs from Amazon, cost me $46) weren't work. The dimension of light bulb is off from the fixture. it is a piece of junk. it's better get from original manufacture. I change the whole light fixture at the end. I will not buy $46 light bulb from Amazon for this light fixture anymore."
2,"GE 22181 - F382D/835/4P - 38 Watt Fluorescent Butterfly Light Bulb, 3500K","The item took too long to arrive. The 38 Watt Fluorescent Butterfly Light Bulb purchased arrived broken, still sealed in it's package. Leo Flores"
5,Fast service,"I barely know how to replace a light bulb. When this went out in the laundry room, I was quite nonplussed to discover this crazy pretzel shaped bulb hiding inside the fixture. That it would cost $20 to replace, and no-one stocked them locally added to the experience. Fortunately, this seller was very prompt / quick to deliver, and happily, the problem turned out to only be the bulb. The bonus was that my better half was unable to laugh at my non-handiness (this time)."
1,Sent without packaging,Bulb came from Amazon and was just thrown in a box and sent to me. Arrived in a million pieces.
1,arrived broken,"I really shouldn't rate it with 1 star but since it arrived damaged, I have no other choice. It probably should have been packaged better."
5,A Monumental In-Depth Study,"This amazing volume is as much a concise history of philosophy as it is an exploration of why we go to war(and how we might avoid it). The author is conversant with relevant thought and events from twenty five centuries ofdebate on this sorest of subjects. This volume is a 1980s re-issue of the 1960 original, not a new edition.Good call by the publishers: Bainton's work could hardly have been improved upon. When you think about it, that's apretty good definition of a ""classic,"" which this friendly book is.Like an all-night conversation with a charming and erudite friend, this book will challenge your assumptions and clarify your mind."
1,"Cool toy, too small","My dog loved the toy, but it was much smaller than I had expected. Bought a few toys and they all were like that. Only complaint is that the description didn't explain that it was a SMALL dog toy. Would hope that next time it will."
4,Ditto my review,Ditto my review of the same product -- only in the George W Bush form. Hillary is just as amusing and our dog loves tearing her apart too!
5,Uber-awesome,"I love how the characters on Buffy speak. So distinctive and so funny and so clever. And now here's a book all about their use of language and ""Slayer Slang!!!!"" Sometimes I wish Buffy weren't so successful on TV, because other shows have tried to imitate this way of speaking and the results have been awful. Exhibit #1: Charmed. But as for Buffy, it's all good, and this book is great reading for fans, because the way that Buffy and her Scooby friends talk is a critical appeal of the show. I highly recommend this if you like the Buffyverse."
2,"Good in theory, but...","I thought that this book had a great premise, but I was disappointed when it arrived because it wasn't what I expected. To me, the interesting thing with ""Buffyspeak"" has always been more about the process of creating the language, not a rehashing of clever phrases from scripts, books, and posting boards (which is what the book mainly focuses on). Though the dictionary is thoroughly detailed, I don't really care about what episodes these phrases originated in, the different ways in which Buffy-type words can function, or even having a record of Buffy vocab.Buy this if you find yourself saying exact quotes from past Buffy episodes in everyday conversation. Don't buy this if you're in search of anything more than what is strictly indicated in the book description."
3,Academics should stay away from pop culture,"""In other words, if people were honest, Buffy would appeal to all of them, one way or another.""So apparently, anyone who doesn't like Buffy is a liar, deluded, or just being contrarian.The book is okay, but yeah, it does a lot of that academic thing where they don't say ""I like this, you should check it out,"" but instead say ""I like this because it is clearly the best thing ever done. Now sit still while I write a book about all the reasons why it is the best thing ever. When I am finished, you will realize that if you don't like it, you are objectively wrong.""They seem to think they can explain and transmit their passions through dry academic discourse. It's weird."
3,"Nice, but not that nice for the price","This is a beautiful top, with an undergarment. Nice, but way overpriced for the quality."
5,Lucky Hearth Cricket,Goes well with the polished brass crickets that I got for Christmas gifts. I have always been told that a brass cricket on the hearth will bring you luck.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I have this shower radio and it doesn't work. It barely picks up any radio stations and when it does pick up one, you have to turn the volume all the way up to barely hear it. I haven't even gotten it wet. I don't know why it doesn't work. I just know that I would not recommend it to anyone else."
2,"lasts forever, darn it.","This radio has only fair reception, and it is VERY difficult to tune to a station unless your hands are dry dry dry. This is a ""shower"" radio...HELLO.... The best (or worst, in my case) thing about it is that it seemingly lasts forever. I've had it for years,and it still runs pretty much like new, but I'm on this site to find a replacement."
5,Breathtaking,"I'm a newcomer to Krishna Das' music, but now a total convert. I first heard this CD in a yoga class (perfect for your home yoga practice!) and rushed home to order on Amazon.com. The music is both soothing and invigorating, with a haunting beat. Krishna Das' voice has an appealing grittiness that still manages to float above the rhythmic chanting below. Great for driving, for yoga, or even as background music, you'll find yourself singing along. I even hear my 5-year-old daughter singing along in the back seat! Buy this CD -- you'll love it."
5,This is IT!,"Magical. Uplifting. Spiritual. Devotional. You name it. I've been looking for this for more than a year, and have gone through 100's to find it. Chant with it. Drum to it. Move to it."
5,More is better,"Two discs is better than one. I cannot say this is the best album because I think all Krishna Das albums are great. ""K.D."" is the superstar of Kirtan (chanting) and this ablum is a musical and spiritual joy. Moreover, it is not a religious music album even though the chants are Sanskrit prayers accompanied by various musical instruments including harmonium, tabla, electric violin, acoustic guitar, bass, temple bells, etc. All Krishna Das albums are musically entertaining and spiritually uplifting. You will like this and his other albums unless you are close-minded and addicted to rap, metal, punk, or teenage singers.If you have seen Krishna Das perform live then you already know that two CDs are better than one. More is better when it comes to Krishna Das, who is originally from Long Island, NY and first went to India during the late 1960s. Try it. Buy it."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this double CD, but am very disapointed. I was hoping that because this was a live session, they would be capture at least a small piece of what live devotional chanting can be. I found the places where the energy really builds to be too short and not frequent enough. I also felt Krishna Das' performance to be too contained, too self conscious, like he never really gets carried away by the chanting. A number of them sound exactly as they do on his non-live albums. I wish he (or someone!) would release a Hanuman Chaleesa that captured some of the pure, high-energy joy that I associate with it, instead of the so-slow almost mournful quality that this one has. sorry to be so negative, I'm just disappointed in this CD...it seems to me to have an over-produced, too-careful quality that left me flat."
4,everyone can enjoy it,"i loved this album and continuously listen to it to uplift my spirits in the car and at work. i was suprised to find that when i by chance played it in the office, it was quite catchy and everyone had fun listening to it and humming along. the simplistic and repetitious style makes it easy to sing along."
4,Entertaining Satan,"The book was interesting and helpful in my research on witchcraft and Early New England. It was a sad, strange time."
3,Not horribly Entertaining,"Book was a bit boring at times. I read this for a History Book report at Austin Community College. It served its purpose and I got a 99 :) However... parts of it were boring, other facts interesting. Has plenty of information if your writing over the topic."
1,Lacks Comprehension,"I am doing something I have never done before! I am writing a review of several reviews of a book. I have not read Entertaining Satan but, for anyone who is contemplating diong so, note carefully whether the author includes biblical data on withcraft. We have, in our society, come to believe that sociology and psychology have these matters completely figured out and have achieved near or complete infallibility. So much so that they may assess even the Bible's infallibilty and classify it according to sociological or pschological categories. The Bible has a fair bit to say about Satan, witchcraft and related subjects and anyone who attempts to write about these things and excludes the biblical data ends up with a severely truncated production. An open mind reading the scriptural evidence will learn infinitely more about witchcraft than from the human speculations of sociology and psychology."
4,Pretty good,"This game is pretty good. Its graphics arent great, and you need a pretty good computer to run it. If you like The Matrix movies its worth having because now its price has dropped! And with the DVD version you dont have to wait half an hour wile installing the four disks of the original version. Its too bad you can only play as Niobe and Ghost though..."
3,only if you have a dvd-rom,"well let's just say this game will blow you away... but that's beyond the fact that you actually NEED a DVD drive(which is a lot of money) installed in your computer, which pretty much limits the consumer-base that this product will appeal to."
2,It should be called Enter a headache,It is more trouble than it is worth. You can't even play as Neo or Trinity. The major problem is that Niobi and Ghost who you can play as are hard to control it is like they do the opposite of what you say. And dont even talk about the System slow down it makes your system become a paper weight ... so dont buy
3,"""for movie fans""you got that right!!!","the graphics are good.i have a problem with the controll.the charactor does this circular stance around opponet which is fine when its one on one,but with multi targets you end up facing the wrong way whilethey are picking you off (i.e.:SWAT HELICOPTOR)considering thats the most challenging aspect,getting the controlls to do what you want,i'd call this a dud.but entertaining none the less"
5,Creative Genius,"This is the perfect software for a person who likes to create projects with grace and beauty. It is simple to use, instuctive,and worth every cent of its cost. I love designing my own greeting cards and playing with graphics. For the person who enjoy expressing creative genius-- this software is for you!"
1,Print Artist Gold I am not happy with,"it worked fairly well when I had windows 95 but I got alot of GPF's with that software and blue screens. It is not a friendly software to other clip art software. Now I cannot use it at all on windows XP in fear that it would crash it. The system freezes and locks up when I scan. I cannot import/export or select a twain driver. But I want to leave off saying that Technical support is a joke. All I got was run around automation, with no way to email or to contact a live person. I got bad tech numbers- which leads me to an operator saying that the numbers have changed and is no longer in service and all of this is on sierra's website which now deals with gaming materialI cannot get an update, because it does not download. bottom line is think hard to pick a software and you cannot reach any support at all!!!!!!!"
2,not entirely happy,"the package says for beginners(and I'm as beginner as they get), I was first dissappointed that there was not a user manual. A quick reference card is not that useful for a beginner. The tutorial does not answer any questions that I may have about using the program. Needless to say I am a little disappointed but I will figure it out eventually. If there is a manual available I would like to have it cause it would make using the program a little easier."
4,Good songs,"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling: 20 All Time Favorite Irish Songs is forty-three minutes and fifty-two seconds long and was released on March 16, 1999. This CD was offer exclusively through Publishers Clearing House. The CD does not list the names of the artists singing the song. The tunes on it are not that bad. In my opinion this would make good Saint Patrick Day party music. When Irish Eyes Are Smiling: 20 All Time Favorite Irish Songs gets a B+.1. When Irish Eyes Are Smiling2. It's A Great Day for the Irish3. Danny Boy4. Galway Bay5. My Wild Irish Rose6. Whiskey in the Jar7. The Rose of Tralee8. The Bard of Armagh9. Roisin the Bow10. Isle of Innisfree11.

Cockles and Mussels20. Phil the Fluter's Ball"
1,Leave us alone and send more money,"The previous reviewer is exactly right. Leave us alone and send more money is the only answer Bracey finds viable. A shame that he devotes himelf so desperately to trying to find ways to avoid the mountains of evidence against the system which has failed so many kids so badly and not to finding solutions.Does he really believe the current situation is acceptable? Perhaps it is not as bad as the statistics show in his non inner city experience. Unfortunately, I don't even believe this is completely true. I think he just doesn't want to see the questions because he, and the other defenders of the education status quo, are afraid of the answers.It is also laughable that he feels supporters of his position (which includes, presumably, the teachers under so much criticism) are so hapless they actually need a step by step guide to dodging the questions they should be asking themselves and the reality they see everyday."
1,Monolithic Drivel,"It continues to amaze me that evidence, whether it be anecdotal or data driven, is systematically ignored (in step) by educrats who refuse to accept a shred of criticism, and in turn, refuse to change their ways. ""Leave us alone and send more money!"" is the monotonous message of this book, and Bracey will tell educators (who apparently are incapable of thinking for themselves), step by step how to do it. There is nothing more annoying than an educator who argues against education. Gosh, who needs to be smart anyway?"
5,Great book....,"This is a great book from cover to cover. I would recommend it for anyone interested in pottery/ceramics. It's loaded with full color photos. And it provides a lot of great how-to's. It covers everything from handbuilding to throwing, and slipcasting. Most topics are not covered in great depth, but the author does provide plenty of info to get you going. It has some good recipes for colored slip, and a great reference in the back. The example images alone are worth the price of this book."
4,Great Resource,This book would make an excellent textbook for a beginning ceramics class. It covers a wide breadth of topics and is clearly written and easy to understand. For experienced potters it is a good choice for a overall studio resource. One of the things that I like most is that the examples of artists works shown have a decidedly European bent; it is nice to see the work of different artists.
3,Perfectly Acceptable Introduction,"Lots of photos and not overly lengthy. Very accessible for the beginner. I already had Susan Peterson's _The Craft and Art of Clay_ in my library and found _the complete potter_ to not measure up. There were fewer step-by-step instructions on hand building and throwing. Less specific information about glazing. I'm always happy to have another book, but if I could only have one, I'd go with Peterson's."
3,"""First Time"" is a Robbie Williams rip-off","The song ""First Time"" sounds great on the Dodge commercials, but it sounds like a blatant copy of a Robbie Williams tune, ""Win Some, Lose Some"" on his 1999 US debut album, The Ego Has Landed.Check it out."
2,too safe,"I have really enjoyed Lifehouse over the past couple of years and have never owned any of their stuff. I wanted a good summer listen, so I bought this cd. The songs were just okay, but only few were slighly catchy, the rest being very mellow and too safe. I really expected better of them. Overall, just 2 stars.On the optomistic route, though, his voice was nice and the songs were sweet."
4,Good CD,I usually buy CD's becoz of one song and this one was no different. I listened to the whole CD and like a number of other songs on it. I will probably buy more CD's by this group.
5,LifeHouse has done it again!,"I love this band! Jason Wade has an amazing voice --- very distinctive in a sea of soundalikes. Whether it's the upbeat, feel good songs that you have to turn up when you're driving, like First Time or the heartfelt, beautiful ballads like Easier to Be, LifeHouse delivers awesome music that doesn't disappoint. This is my favorite of all their CD's."
5,Lifehouse - Who We Are,One of my all time favorite cds! So far not a day has gone by that I don't listen to it. All the songs are great!
3,Very consistant and crafty songwriting,"I'll keep this simple.....a really good mature CD by a band who keeps getting better. If you like this CD, also check out the Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded CD/DVD....heavier band, but on the same track with the melodies and sing/song chorus"
5,Back To What We Love,"I've honestly enjoyed all of Lifehouse's albums, but none so much as the first one, until now. This CD is much more like the band's debut album-it is edgier, the lyrics are more substantial, it has a couple of nice ballads, and it definitely has more of an overall rock feel reminiscent of the Hanging By A Moment and Quasimodo. It's a must if you've ever enjoyed any of Lifehouse's songs-all of the songs are enjoyable, rather than just filler centered around a couple of hits like so many alternative albums lately. Give it a shot."
5,best cd yet,I love every song on this cd!I now own every Lifehouse cd...and this is the best so far.
5,Landmark Lifehouse Release!,"I'll admit that I got hooked by ""Hanging By A Moment"" like the rest of us in 2000. In some ways it seems like the band is so defined by that song that some don't really give a full appraisal of their body of work. As much as I enjoyed the first 3 releases, in my opinion ""Who We Are"" is the landmark Lifehouse release. It has standout songs like ""First Time"" and ""Broken"". I also love ""Whatever It Takes"", ""Disarray"", and ""Storm"". Unlike the other releases which were a step down from ""No Name Face"", ""Who We Are"" is solid from beginning to end and in my opinion is their best overall."
4,Who We Are,I really like Lifehouse and didn't have this CD. I like what I received and was glad that it was in fair shape and the CD was in good shape...
3,"Nicely built, but ...","Nicely built chair, the cords are very comfy and it is sturdy with no noises. The only issue I have is the arm rests are small and the leg support is to short. Great for a small woman or a teen, but an average size male would not find it comfortable."
1,A VERY BAD SHOPPING EXPERIENCE,"If you were to get it, this is a wonderful knife. However, DON'T GET IT THROUGH AMAZON FROM ""PRICE PRO"". They advertise the case knife and show its picture and then send you a different, and lower quality knife.Yellow Handle Series 3318 CV Medium Stockman Md: 00035."
3,Fun filler,"Another fun, but not necessary add-on during the DCW period features a solid single and some worthy bonus cuts which do not posess the compositional fortitude to warrant a purchase outside of completists but nonetheless continues to provide quality filler for fans."
2,D Sides,"I just revisitted this single and was reminded why I stopped buyin' B&S singles. The ""A"" side is a fine song, but it's on the album Dear Catastrophe Waitress so if yuh have that record it's a waste of cash as yer just rebuyin' a song. The ""B"" sides are, like many B&S extra tracks, seem more like unfinished sketches than actual songs. The Avalanches version (remix?) of ""Cuckoo"" is a musical novelty which really doesn't elicit much more than a ""Huh."" ""Travelling Light"" is an empty bit of noodlin' about that may have been pleasant if Stuart had sang but instead we get what's-his-face's typically weak lead vocals. ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" is the strongest of the non-album cuts, a somewhat catchy 60s folk pop piece that suddenly switches to a decent lil surf instrumental halfway through. ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" is worth a paid download and in the case of this review it's worth an extra star."
1,Worst song,I'm a cuckoo. this is no doubt in my opinion the worst song belle and sebastian ever recorded. Ever. It may be on eof the worst songs ever put on tape. Buy the books one...
5,The Beginning of Much Needed Change,"This book has the potential of greatly improving many lives. As the author points out so well, many people forsake way too much for the often-illusionary dream of ""golden years,"" when they can finally relax, enjoy their lives, endulge their passions, travel, etc. However, the book illustrates that the TRADITIONAL ways of viewing retirement are WRONG in today's world. It stifles creativity, joy, exploration, fulfillment, and ultimately one's longevity. The author is on to something important. A paradigm shift is needed and this book is just the one to start it. Read it with an open mind and you'll notice subtle changes in your thinking, an increased sense of enthusiasm, and a new plan for your future."
3,untitled,"I think that the lowell childrenshould have been able to stay apart of that bandand be in the concert, like they really wanted.it just breaks my heart to see those childrenbeing left out of whatthey should be a part of. END"
3,"New snobby family wants blonde-hair, blue-eyed baby-sitter.",A new snobby family wants the Baby-sitter Club to baby-sit their three kids. While Jessi and Claudia are hurt from begin turned away from them just because they are not blondes with blue eyes; the baby-sitters won't argue with them so they turn the snobbs away. Just as they did to Jessi and Claudia.
3,It's okay,"I received this bag today using an Amazon Prime trial membership, I must say it was delivered really fast, 2 days and i got it very early. On the other hand, the bag is just okay, color is not as in the picture but still works. I was looking for a cheap weekender bag and this one does its job. I'd say 3 stars. Thank you!"
3,Smuggler's Moon,"Really truly love or maybe I should have said loved this series. The adding of the charectar of Clarissa has turned meoff somewhat of the series. Why Alexander tinkered with what was a great series is a bit of a mystery to me initself. Maybe his editor felt like the series needed a Nancy Drew touch. It doesn't. Use to couldn't wait for thenext book in the series as they are so wonderfully written and would rate all the past books a five star. Oh, I will get the next book but not with the same excitement and anticipation as I had in the past."
2,About the Same as The Others,"Bruce Alexander's series of 18th century detective stories were sort of fun and interesting for a while there, but this is the eighth one and they're just not getting any better. Readers know from the outset who the bad guy is, so it's sort of like watching a Scooby-Doo episode and waiting for him to be unmasked. Alexander's writing is passable in a pop-fiction sort of way, but the plot is too thin and wooden and the characters too one-sided and predictable. Nothing is really happening in this series. I've read my last Alexander novel."
5,Amethyst earrings,I got these for my mom for her birthday and she loved them. Good size and very dainty.
4,amethyst earrings,These earrings are very pretty. I was a little disappointed in the size - they are very tiny. I guess the price reflects the size.
4,Beautiful for a birthday gift,I was searching for a birthday gift for my 19 year old granddaughter and when I saw the earrings and necklace I knew that was the exact perfect gift and she loved it.
1,its no good,"its no good, it don't wert a doller and a piece of rag could do a better job, thats the truth."
1,It looks cheaps. It feels cheap. It did not run at all.,"I have a Toyota Corolla 2010. Then, I have this little vacuum that did not work at all. You can't say that there's something wrong with the car or its car lighter. My car is newly purchased and the car lighter is 12 volt.The vacuum was a defective product.For potential consumers, purchase it on your own risk. It's $20 anyway.If it's okay for you to spend casually, buy me one too.But, now, I'm just going to get my refund. Peace out. One love."
4,works great!,This sucked in more dirt than I expected. It's pretty powerful.It looks like a used model with no product logo too.... but I don't care as long as it does it's job!
4,Does the job.,"This vacuum is surprisingly powerful if maintained properly. The cord is extra long and I can reach the back of my SUV with no problem. It comes with one basic accessory which is very effective. Seems cheaply made, but hasn't quit yet; I've used it at least once a week for over four months. I would purchse this item again if it lasts at least a year or more."
3,it's ok..,"I've had this vacuum for about year and a half. I bought it immediately after purchasing my Audi and wanted to have a car vacuum that is very portable to keep in the trunk, and uses cigarette charger, and gets the job done. After a frequent use of this product, I feel like I need to upgrade to a more powerful vacuum because this one doesn't have enough voltage to pick up small dirt and lints that are attached to the floor mat. Little snack crusts on the leather seat are sucked in after 3~4 sweeps but still the vacuum doesn't pick up everything. 3 stars because it still gets the job done and very portable but I recommend getting more powerful vacuum (15V at least) if you want to make your life a little easier."
3,works as expected,"Worked as expected, has a normal amount of vacuum strength.The cable length and connector has a decent range to clean up inside the car."
1,Worthless power,"I was really hoping this would be sufficient for vacuuming my seats and mats, but the suction power is horrible. It won't even pick up dog hair from the seats. I still have to bring my regular house vacuum out in the garage and use that to vacuum."
3,Decent Vacuum,Adequate for quick cleanups in your car. Easy to empty. Don't expect it to deep clean or pick up every piece of lint.
3,Basic Car Vacuum,This is a very basic car vacuum. The cord is long enough to reach every where in the car. The suction power is also acceptable. The only problem is the seal for the filter is not tight and sometimes the dust comes out.
4,An Unusual Twist in this Regency Romance Story,"Spoiler Alert***Actually I love Carla Kelly's style of writing and have purchased most of her books. This book had a very surprising turn of events and I was well pleased with how things turned out. Without giving too much away, there were two potential love matches for our lovely heroine and although it seemed as though things were quite settled, well... perhaps they were not settled after all. You will have to read the story to find out. This book will definitely hold your interest from beginning to end."
4,Unusual turn for a Regency,"Carla Kelly is one of my favorite authors and she doesn't disappoint here.The surprising thing is that the supposed hero loses the girl in the end and the bumbling suitor wins her. Doctor Anthony Cook is a large man who seems to always be the bull in the china shop. Libby Ames even makes fun of him with her cousin at the beginning of the story. She meets the Duke of Knaresborough in disguise and he is everything a hero should be - at least after Libby and the doctor dry him out and help him recover from fighting in the war. Yet, Libby eventually realizes that she loves Dr. Cook and follows her heart.Ms. Kelly does her usual fine job of making all her characters come alive and building interesting plot twists. Even though I like the Duke, I do follow her lead and accept that he wasn't the hero for Libby.Enjoy the book!"
2,Catchier Title would Be Libby's Proposals,"A catchier (and less misleading) title for this book would be Libby's Proposals. There's the proposal from Nes for marriage, withdrawn after he realizes she's penniless. There's his less honorable proposal of mistress. There's Dr. Cook's first proposal that Libby turns down, since she wants a prince, not a gawky frog. There are Dr. Cook's proposals (almost one every time she turns her head). Finally, there's Nes' final honorable proposal of marriage. Which one will she choose?"
3,Title is misleading,"I wish I could give it 5 stars. I really do because I love Carla Kelley and am trying to buy up her complete back list. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars was because at least I got to know Nesbitt before I read his book 'One Good Turn'. At first I couldn't figure out how he could have two books written for him. Then lo and behold! I do something I NEVER EVER do...skip to the end and I find... Well, I don't want to give it away. You'll have to find out for yourself. Needless to say, I never finish that book and go right on to OGT. I will grudgingly admit that what I read of this one was good though, so worth 3 stars."
1,shovel tuffy,"This Tuffy shovel I bought, thinking it would do the job has been a dissapointment. I thought this shouvel would be great help with snow, as well, as other home projects unfortunately it turned out to be a flop for me. My reasons are as followes:#1 The tuffy shouvel is way to small of a scoop for snow, The plastic shovels from the home store are much larger, as much as 35%. your get a better scoop, meaning more material is being moved much faster. meaning Done with job much quicker.#2 The lenth of the handle is way too short (mind you I'm only 5'7"".) It fitgue you because your have to bend over much further. the handle need about 6 inches more added to it. A taller person would not be happy at all.I do believe they have a great idea..it just need to be perfected."
2,Not as good as it could have been.,"I bought this for scooping silage out of silage bags, because plastic slides better on the bags and the other plastic shovels I've used broke too easy. There are two things wrong with this shovel, first is the length it is to short at 42"" (most other shovels are 48"" long) making it hard on your back. Second is the angle of the head from the handle, it needs to be straighter to make it easier to push with. Like another reviewer said they have a good idea it just needs perfected."
3,Ichiro,"It is about Ichiro going to the M.L.B. and about his life as a kid, and about how the Mariners got him. It's also about him being the second player in history to win the M.V.P and the rookie the of the year in the same season. Matt Christopher is the author.The book's name is ""At the Plate with Ichiro"".My favorite part is in the book is the 2001 All-Star game when Ichiro led off and got a single in Seattle. The story takes place in Japanand the U.S.A.People who like baseball would like this book. The book started good. And it told us about how he was the most exciting player in Japan. I liked the book because it is about baseball. And because it is about him going to the U.S.A. I was a fun book to read.by Jackson"
2,Drug companies aren't the only villains,"Yes, it's true that pharmaceutical prices are skyrocketing and that SSRIs are among the most frequently prescribed. Yes, it's also true that SSRI's have been _associated with_ suicidal thoughts (causation has not been proved). However, from personal experience with family, friends, and patients, I can also tell you that SSRIs have saved some lives.One other reviewer points out that patients should be monitored very closely after starting a drug. That's the real problem right there. With declining reimbursements and increasing patient panels, primary care physicians are often not able to see patients within the first week or so. That's the fault of the health care system, not the drug companies.Frankly, we need a complete overhaul of the system, so that everyone can be assured of access to the standard of care that many of us enjoy."
2,very disappointing,"An interesting book and there will be much discussion as to whether David Healy is ultimately correct.However, what does concern me about David Healys work, is that it is basically negative. If he believes that S.S.R.I.sare in many cases worse than placebo, what is he advocating in their place? It is well understood that anti-depressants along with the various counselling therapies, can prove very effective.In Doctor Healys local authority however, there is a 9 month waiting list to see a psychologist. Is David Healy advocating and campaigning for more psychologists in his work-place?In the future, new drugs will have less and less relevance. It is becoming far too expensive to continue to develop and test them. There has to be an alternative.2 of the most beneficial are: MEDITATION and HEALING With the right tools anyone can practice both with amazing results and nil side-effects.IT IS TIME RIGHT NOW FOR EVERYONE TO WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE1111"
1,Not the bra I wanted.,"This isn't the exquisite form bra I wanted but the picture of it is blurry so couldn't see it well. I wanted the one that has a lace covered top of the cup.There is no ""give"" in the all cotton bra I received and it's very uncomfortable to wear."
3,Big oops,Make sure you measure yourself prior to ordering. I measured but the cups are HUGE!!! I could not use the bras I ordered. Also the straps are cotton and have no give so I'm sure they would cut into the top of the shoulder if I could wear it. I thought I got a steal but sometimes you get what you pay for. The shipping was fast though.
4,Exquisitely exquisite,This is one of the best kept secrets in the lingerie industry. It gives great coverage and support and the price is definitely right.
1,"Unless you're Madonna, stay away...","So, unless you're into ""torpedo titties"" where it looks like you are mimicking Madonna's infamous cone bra, this bra is not recommended!!! If I had known before I purchased this item, that it would make my chest look like I was wearing two traffic cones on my front, I wouldn't have bothered. The frontal photo is very deceiving! If you saw this from the side, it would scare you. I will never wear this item; I was even embarressed just to show it to my husband after trying it on (and he definitely made fun of me during the three minutes I was wearing it.) This bra = not even for Halloween."
3,Very Beginning Level- Not all that great,"I have never been cruising and really did not find this book to be very enlightening. It was VERY basic. You can expect things like ""This is the hull, this is the sail"" kind of stuff. I was really looking for more advanced topics like weather, emergency situations, planning a long distance cruise, etc.This book is really for those of you thinking about buying a sailboat for cruising and have absolutely no boating experience. It touches on basic troubleshooting (and I mean basic) but does not really go in depth. I also purchased SAILING FUNDAMENTALS by Gary Jobson (Author), and found this book to be worth every penny. I would only recommend Cruising Fundamentals to those of you dreaming of cruising in the future, not very useful for anyone actually doing it.I would rate this book at a high-school reading level."
2,Just OK,"This is a fine book, along with Sailing Fundamentals, if you're taking the corresponding ASA course(s). All the information is valid but is geared to passing the course as opposed to just teaching sailing. Additionally, my ASA course instructor said that ASA is getting ready to drop both of these books."
5,Great cruising book!,This is a fantastic book to keep on the boat with information I have not found elsewhere. A must for the cruising sailor's library.
3,Helpful but limited,"Unfortunately, the illustrations in this book are of varying quality, with some looking as though they were painted from specimens. Moreover, there are no flight depictions, just static poses. However, the book is useful for focusing your attention on the set of species you need to know in northern California. I recommend using a Sibley identification guide with this book."
4,Quite good,"Quite good. Like the indexing the most. Very handy for newer birders to the area or people starting with birding in Norcal (highly recommend).3 areas could improve.1- comparison section is good, but does not cover similar looking birds of other families (e.g: compares short billed dowitcher with long billed dowitcher but need this to be clapper rail vs willet vs dowitcher)2- need pictures of both flight and sitting positions for some birds (e.g: different hawks, others like northern mockingbirds)3- a bit smaller size will make this a better field guide"
1,There's music on it.,"As a technical director for an astonishingly busy academic theater, it would have been very handy to have a full cd of only Ocean Surf and another of Thunderstorms in our library. I made the mistake of thinking (wishful thinking?) the word ""music"" on the lable was just part of a series title. I was disappointed to discover that there really is music over the sound effects which renders the cd useless to theaters. I'm still hoping someone will record a cd of just these sounds. Amazon has some fine cds of various environmental sounds, however, but I advise you make sure there's no music on them before you buy, and when a package arrives, carefully read the box before tearing open the plastic wrapping. Cheers."
3,"Good Charger,But it is not Full Automatic!!","If you are looking for a battery charger that you can plug in ,set it and forget it, you will need a full automatic charger not a Manually set type of charger like this one.Unfortunately, it does not describe this feature in the summary given for this product. Schumacher charger is the best charger out there."
4,My first Micro!,"This was my first experience into DJ Micro and I like it! Although I prefer the slow beats building up to an explosive mix (like Okenfold), DJ Micro still is pleasing to the ears. His stuff is mostly fast beats but he does mix it up with some vocal tracks that break it up a bit. Overall...it's a great mix CD. I would recommend."
3,"Decent CD, not the best.","This is your standard techno fair. I recently saw DJ Micro at Saggitarius in December of 2000, and he was the highlight. This is not his best CD. He has made better CDs earlier in his career, so go for them."
4,Very powerful mix but...,"DJ Micro throws out here a very powerful mix. First time I heard it I was driving to an appointment and found my foot pressing the gas pedal to the floor. I don't think many people could dislike the music here. It seems to me to connect with the original reason I got into dance/techno/trance music (Matrix films having much to do with it among others). The only problem I had with it was that I awaited some tremendous ending track to this disc. Something, you know, magical, inspirational, etc. Kinda like how DJ Paul Oakenfold ends his Global Underground : New York disc with Deeper Love - (Symphonic Paradise mix, with BBE) which I think is supperb. Instead the final track is probably the least enjoyable track on the disc that just reminds me of a downward sloping hill. It starts off like the rest of the album but eventually reaches the bottom of the hill where the track just dies."
1,Title is Misleading,"Although this study guide claims to be for the Oklahoma Subject Area Test (OSAT) for history it is not much help for either the U.S. or world history test. If you are studing for these tests, I advise you to search the internet for free study guides and quizzes."
5,PATIO DOOR HANDLE,It was a great product. Lock works well and was a great replacement since our other handle had come apart.
2,The Magic has gone...,"I'm a big fan of Connie Francis, but the chemistry between Connie and Hank (who is good performer) is missing. Songs are badly produced and boring."
3,ok:not as good as Star Wars,"mark hammill is a good actor, but this just isnt his best movie.but i liked it"
2,Bad....but amusing,"I saw this movie because it had Mark Hamill in it. This movie is forced, poorly plotted, and has ok acting. The only redeeming point was the good music. Save your money and time...don't get or watch this movie!"
2,"This movie is cute, but far from original","Don't get me wrong, I love Mark Hamill, in fact he's my all time favorite actor, and I thought the movie was cute, but it did nothing to help his career. When he goes back in time to save the human race, is far from original. Sorry, Mark!! Love ya, but this movie is not one I would pay to see in a theatre."
1,Live an extra two hours.,"The paid review gives you the reasons (bad writing, bad presentation), but it doesn't really give you a feel for the total effect. So allow me... Just think, you can live an extra two hours every time you don't waste them watching this film! Eek! What a waste of celluloid. This film was on my list of films that no one should have to watch. Maybe we'll get lucky and Mystery Science Theatre will be able to give it their treatment. That's the only thing they could do to this film to make it watchable. As Bill the Cat would say, ""Nyet! Nyet! Ack Ackthtpthtpptht!"" I give this turkey two thumbs and both big toes down. :-p"
2,What the heck is this?!,"What kind of stupid movie is this? Very bad plot, though the part about Michael Raynor trying to save himself as a baby was good, it isn't original. I hope Mark Hamill got payed well for this one, because it sure didn't help his career (no offence Mark, you're a great actor.)"
3,a slight disappointment,"used to love all sierra programs; i have the ancient version 4 of Print Artist (I believe it number 4) on my home computer so i thought this new version would be an improvement for my office laptop - very disappointing - and yet there games are so awesome - don't get me wrong its ok, but not up to their game standards. and no where near as nice as the new Print Master 15 (DVD) -"
1,requires prior knowledge of print artist,after using print artist 4.0 version... this new upgrade requires the knowledge of an EINSTEIN. Where are the printed manuals we used to obtain in past years? Its sad to have to figure out step-by-step how? what? where? .This took me time to figure out....DO I INSTALL THE 6 CD'S ENCLOSED? DO I STOP INSTALLING WHEN CD # 3 TOLD ME TO STOP? If I did not have the highest respect for Print Artist... I would surely have given up by now. It had taken me 2-3 hours to figure the software out. still having problems. My advice... IF you are a noviceDO NOT PURCHASE THIS SOFTWARE.
1,Will not print - No support,I had an older version of Print Artist and just purchased version 2003. My wife tried to print a simple card she made with disastrous results. After some investigation I found that this is a known bug which Sierra refuses to fix since they have discontinued this product. The program simple does not work. I learned of a complicated workaround where you put a transparent gif on every page to make it print correctly. I tried to return the product to Amazon but my 30 days had just run out and the only recourse was to sell a faulty program to some other unsuspecting person which I won't do.
1,Print Artist Deluxe 2003,"I have Print Artist 4.0, but now have windows xp so need to update my package. I need some advice whether Gold or Deluxe is better??? The 6 CD's on deluxe is putting me off. Is it as easy to use as 4.0?? -Basically can anyone use Deluxe? Or is it for the more experienced wiz kid??"
3,PRINT ARTIST de luxe 2003,I would like to order only this one itemi have PRINT ARTIST 04 BUT IT DOES NOT WORKmY ADDRESS IS :Guido De WispelaereBrialmontlei 42\32018 AntwerpenBelgium( Pay by delivery)
2,Chunks of drivel,"Considering the simplicity of the plot, it is surprising that the book could have been as thick as it was.If I had physically cut out all the insignificant paragraphs I could not help skimming over, or perhaps should have, I'm sure the book would only be about 2 pages long.Obviously most books are really like that, and without descriptions and frills, no books would be worth reading. This one was alright, but considering its length, a lot of boring drivel could have been cut out, and the plot could have been more complicated.I couldn't put it down though, if that's a positive side, and I read it all in 4 hours. It entertained me for one afternoon, but only because I was hanging out for something - which a baby could have predicted anyway."
4,The photos only tell part of the story,"For anyone interested Adirondack history and lore this is a must-read book. What the book lacks in logical organization and strong visuals it makes up for with exceptional information. Fans of small boats and those interested in the Adirondack Guideboat have few places to turn for guideboat information and on that front this book delivers. There are many very useful drawings that show details found few other places. Many pages are devoted to the output of various well-known guideboat builders and this makes for some very interesting reading. The writing style is easy to follow, but the organization is somewhat choppy. What the book really needs is better photography. Many of the photos are from archives from the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
3,decent electronica,"Din Fiv is new to me. I ordered on whim, because I heard it at listening station at some store. It sounded good, infact it sounded great. However, when it arrived to my home and I got to listen to it in full, I was a little disappointed. I found the lyrics to be trite at best. It had some great beats but a lot of of it lack the flow of most songs on the album. musically, when it was good it was great. The good tracks were few and far between."
1,good for about 3 months,"I have bought 2 of these and they last about 3 months, good shock while they last , then your horses are outand about, light indicates its working even when its not"
3,"An OK solution, but versatile and compact","I initially purchased this thinking it would be a fantastic solution as I live in an apartment with neighbors. It does a decent job of muting, but I do notice odd resistance at higher notes, which is in part due to me getting back into playing after 10 years and trying to rebuild a weak embouchure. I like that because it is fabric it folds down and fits in my instrument case and it is incredibly light, so weight-wise it is barely noticeable. There are better sounding solutions on the market, but this does offer attractive features."
5,Another Jurassic classic,"In this prequel to Eric Garcia's ANONYMOUS REX, private investigator (and velociraptor) Vincent Rubio gets duped into helping his partner locate his ex-wife's brother who is part of a cult known as the Progressives.Allow yourself to suspend your belief in the premise of a society of dinosaurs roaming the streets of L.A. disguised as humans, and you'll have a blast reading Eric Garcia's highly imaginative dino-noir classics.CASUAL REX, like its predecessor, is witty, charming and lots of fun."
3,Worthy prequel to Anonymous Rex,"I bought this book because I absolutely loved Anonymous Rex. For those who don't know, this detective series is about a private investigator named Vincent Rubio, who also happens to be a dinosaur. It turns out that dinosaurs never became extinct. They just decided to disguise themselves to look like humans. Not all dinosaurs agree, however, and have formed a back-to-nature cult.As with Anonymous Rex, Garcia's writing is crisp and witty and fits the genre with tongue-in-cheek. I found this book as funny and entertaining as the original and I highly recommend it.I know that Garcia already has another dinosaur private eye book out called Hot and Sweaty Rex, but I doubt I will read it. It was a great idea, but I am glad to hear that Garcia is letting the dinosaurs go after that. Three dinosaur PI books is plenty."
5,Audio Version - If you can find it - GET IT!,"Picked this up on eBay recently, and was astounded at what an absolutely fantastic reader Jim Hanks (brother of Tom - Yes, THAT Tom Hanks) was. This guy understands that audiobooks are a separate medium that require specific skills, particularly in the humor genre. It's not enough to know how to read, you must be able to perform and bring the words on the page to life. The reader must also be matched to the material in the same way animated chracters are in films. Jim Hanks is a PERFECT match. It's a shame he didn't get the job for the other 'Rex' novels.Five stars, Jim! You do the Hanks name proud."
4,It's a Crowd Pleaser,"I love the Lewis Family, and I enjoy most of their DVDs. This DVD is a pretty good one. Little Roy can get on your nerves at times, but all in all, it is enjoyable."
2,"Case Cutlery 263 Case Canoe Pocket Knife with Chrome Vanadium Blades, Amber Bone",The knife looked great when I received it. I was very disappointed with the knife when I went to use it today. Both blades and some of the metal on the knife body have some spots on them. It looks like it might be some oxidation although it does not appear to be the usual rust oxidation. This is the first time I used the knife although I have been carrying it with me for about two weeks. I believe the knife should be of better quality.
5,Enhanced my appreciation of the sea,"I'm studying at home in lieu of taking a course, and am very satisfied with this textbook. Illustrations are beautiful, and the authors' approach to the topic is thorough, yet easy to comprehend and inspires further study. I'm very fortunate to live on the seacoast and take frequent beach walks - this book has enhanced my appreciation of the sea and its life forms."
2,ridiculously overpriced,"For the size and number of pieces-- this product should be about 20 dollars or less. Also no instructions were included, which disappointed my 6 year old-- since she prides herself on being able to follow the directions and construct herself. Otherwise- same good quality and fun you expect from lego."
4,Ramona Quimby overcomes her jealousy,"The book Ramona and her mother is about a 7 year old little girl who is jealous of her big sister Beatrice and she wants to spend time with her mommy as mommy's little girl but Beezus has already taken on that role. In the end, Ramona Quimby gets her wish...To spend time with her mother. You'll need to read this book and find out how it all actually ends. Though this book does have some boring parts, I would recommend this book to any elementary or beginning middle school girl who loves Beverly Cleary books or any girl who might be experiencing what Ramona is going through. I myself can relate because I go through this almost on a daily basis. Sometimes I'm jealous of my baby cousin who gets most of all the attention but in the end (just like Ramona), I get my mommy all to myself.G.B.M. Sanders - 6th grade - Hammond MiddleAlexandria, VA"
2,Spirited but sped-up,"I loved Ramona Quimby as a child and discovered that as an adult, I still love her! I bought three audio books narrated by Stockard Channing, who performs mostly fantastic voices for each of the characters and reads with great spirit, but my chief complaint is:Did it have to be so fast? Sometimes it sounds as if the producers sped up the tapes to fit all the narration onto two CDs. Sometimes Channing gulps and swallows her words, and if I didn't know the text so well, I would have no idea what she was saying. I still enjoy the recording, but it is really vexing to be unable to understand her!Otherwise, this reading is spirited, warm and brings you closer to Ramona! Cleary's depiction of a child's psyche is absolutely accurate. Kids should enjoy Ramona's rambunctious, totally rational (to her eyes) behavior, and Channing's enthusiastic (if speedy) reading."
4,My Daughter's review,"This review is from my Daughter who is 7 years old and in the 2nd grade.I think this book is nice because it has some funny parts. Ramona tries to run away from home because she thinks nobody loves her, but her mother makes her suitcase too heavy on purpose so she can't leave."
5,Romona and her mother,"I had fun reading this book. It is a good book. I enjoyed reading it because, it was a sad story but then it got better at the end because she got what she wanted. I would rate this book a 5. I had a great time reading this book."
5,"""nobody likes Ramona""","Actually, EVERYONE likes Ramona, because she, like all of us, feels unliked at times, and we all identify with her. This book is great and I especially like the flashback where Beezus accuses Ramona of having ruined her checker game 3 years earlier, Ramona denies it hotly (she just doesn't remember), and feels rejected when her mother sides with Beezus.Wonderful book!"
3,Music for young women by young women,"I haven't listened to their first album. i heard enough of it to know it's not my thing. However...with a couple of bland ballads this album really succeeds.Standout tracks include ""Potential Break-up song"" ""Division"" ""Like it or leave it"" ""Like Woah""For writing all their songs their lyrics are pretty clever compared to others their own age who come off as rather cliche or unispired.It does have a similar vibe as Hilary Duffs new album but not as heavy. like i said some of the ballads do tend to bland it out a bit. i won't be adding those to my mp3 player.I also really like the remix of chemicals react.Inconclusion. Aly&Aj; are GROWING. learning the truth about love and how sometimes it hurts.having said that all parents looking for music for their 5th graders...i think you can still get Hanson's Middle of Nowhere...used at least."
4,great second cd.,"I thought that Aly & AJ's first cd was good but I was always a little hesitant about liking it. With this second album of theirs Insomniatic I feel immediately in love with it. Ever since I got it I haven't stopped listening to it. They mix ballads, with pop dance, and I love it."
5,Three Years and it's Still Going HARD!!!!,"This album was purchased in 2007 and I loved it. It is now three years later and I am still bumping the MP3 on my Zune player. The songs are well written and the beats are timeless. I listen to this and almost forget that it has been out for so long. I cannot grade each individual song because I found no flaws non-what-so-ever. I just turned 27 yesterday and have grown out of teen pop but this album is in the ""leave it alone"" category because I still cannot imagine not listening to it. The Christmas album is the same. I have that going all year long! Their first one was not my favorite but I am sure glad I gave them a second try. Buy this album. You will not be disappointed and the amount of times that you listen to it will far outweigh the amount paid. I think it's still 13 dollars because it is a timeless album! Says a lot, trust me!!"
5,Excellent follow up,"Insomniatic is an excellent follow up CD from the sister duo, Aly and AJ. They continue to provide very good pop music, but on this CD the tunes at times have a rock edge. Aly and AJ prove that they really can rock, despite their young age. These girls have talent: they truly can sing and play instruments. the songs aren't silly, they have substance. the listener, of most any age, will find himself/herself humming and tapping along to the songs. I can put this in my CD player and just let it go; there's very little temptation to skip. An impressive sophmore effort. These girls look to have staying power and look unlikely to turn into train wrecks like Britney Spears is lately. Keep it up, Aly and AJ!"
2,Poor Sophomore Album,"Not counting their Christmas album, this is a poor second album. Second albums need to be better than the first and this is not. They need to decide what they want to do. Make music or be in tv show and movies. Doing all of the above seems to have hurt the music side of things."
1,The title says it all sort of.,This albums title is accurate. It's for anyone suffering from a psycho chasing them in their dreams and need to stay awake. These two lip-synching no talet banchee's that play with guitars in their videos (Prop) instead of play the guitars as there is no guitars in any of their songs yet they strum away in the videos fit the bill for sleep deprivation.
5,No Sophomore Jinx here!,"Aly & AJ, are one of the best girl trios of all time. They have originality, wit, and most importantly...voices. Their new album Insomniatic, is a greater hit than their 2006 debut Into the Rush. Even though their first album knocked me off of my feet, their new sophomore album is it. With hot tracks like the leading ""Potential Breakup Song,"" ""Division,"" ""Like Whoa,"" and more. This is one you listen to over and over again."
4,"Not Better Than ""In To The Rush""","Let me start by saying I love Aly and aj and really like their music. I think they are really talented song writters and musicians. But I must say that I was a little dissapointed with insomniatic. I though the songs were going to be more like ""chemicals react"", but when I first heard their first single of this Cd I just couldn't believe how different they sounded. There was very few rock nothing compared to Chemicals react. And now that I've heard the entire album, I guess it's ok, nice lyrics, good sound and all but they sortta changed their genre a bit and I don't like that. They sounded so original on their first album and now they sound a like every other pop singer out there. I prefer their fist album ""in to the rush"" more than this one. Still, good album though but not better thatn the first. Hope there's more of the aly and aj of their last album on their next one."
3,So-so,"My daughter loves Aly and AJ; however, she was disappointed that the songs ""Like Whoa"" and ""Chemicals React"" were performed differently from the music video's on the internet and on the Disney Channel. They remixed the music."
4,Insomniatic - Aly & AJ,"This CD isn't nearly as good as the first (Into the Rush), this one has slower songs and not that catchy lyrics (except for a couple). If you haven't listened to Aly & AJ before, go buy ""Into the Rush"" first then listen to this one. Its a good CD, but I really like the first album best. :D"
4,wayne sump pump,"have used this brand of pump for about 15 years, the motor/pump part is great, the water sensing switch is the weak link. the float arm corrodes and fails in about 2-3 years (water softener dumps into this sump, the brine is bad news on the pump). i consider the pump a maintance item and replace every 2 years--cheap insurance."
1,Junk right out of the box.,"This thing failed me right out of the box. Just when I needed it most it let me down. I tried to disassemble it to see what was the problem and I broke it. The motor ran but it didnt pump. I thought that the close valve was installed backwards, so I followed the manuals directions to troubleshoot. To those people who like to gamble at a bargain, like this 50% off, be very careful."
3,lack of instructions,"Perhaps it's because I purchased a refurbished product that no instructions were included. after I attempted to used the pump, and it failed, I contacted the manufacturer and learned that the minimum outlet was one and one quarter inches. I had attached a one inch outlet so I could attach a garden hose. When I increased the outlet to one and one half inch it still failed. (overheated and shut itself down). Because of my ignorance I may have done irreparable damage.I was very pleased with the rapid delivery of the pump when I ordered it, however."
2,Wayne 1/2 HP sump pump,"I have owned the Wayne 1/2HP sump pump for over 5 years. Originally I intended this pump to be a primary sump pump but after one week of moderate to heavy rains, I soon found out this pump could not handle the flow of water into my sump well. The sump pump ran continuously and I needed a second pump to keep the basement from being flooded. Now I use the Wayne pump strictly as a backup pump. If you don't live in a low lying area as I do, you may be able to get by with this pump as a primary sump pump. One other thing, the pump is relatively noisy."
1,Good choice,I got pulls and knobs for my new kitchen and I am very pleased with everything. They are well make and very handsome with a good weight and comfortable feel - you should always test the way knobs feel since your hand will have a lot of contact with them. These are as smooth and finished on the back as they are on the front.
5,Just like I remembered it!,"I was the leader of MAT III-27 and served in Long An province, not far from where the author was located. The experiences he wrote about could have been mine and this book brought it home to me. I agree with the author's viewpoint concerning the attitude of the Vietnamese MACV was trying to turn around. Although I have not returned to Vietnam, I would expect nothing has changed in their way of life over the past thirty years. And that's not bad!"
4,Nice Hammer Dulcimer Xmas,We love hammer dulicmer and prefer Xmas music that is instrumental as we hear the same songs repeatedly.This is a great sesaonal album to go along with our other celtic xmas music.Very nice.
2,Dull some more.,"This CD features old Christmas carols played on hammered dulcimer. Many people probably don't know what a hammered dulcimer is. It sounds somewhat like an autoharp, but the strings are hammered with mallets, instead of plucked. The songs are all instrumental with no voices. The dulicimer in supported by guitar, flute, piccolo, violin and harp, although not all of those instruments appear on every song. The dulcimer usually plays the melody on the songs, although sometimes the other instruments take over the lead. Joemy Wilson is obviously a great dulcimer player, but I found the album to be rather boring. A bit too genteel for my taste, I'm afraid."
3,Strong opinions,"This lively book is fun to read and will supply you with a lot of interesting factoids on its assortment of topics. Chris Kilham writes interestingly and well, and one's attention is riveted to his stories and opinions. The biggest problem with this book is that there are no footnotes and no endnotes. Kilham offers a lot of stunning notions, but does not cite his sources. For example, in his chapter on decaf, in his view ""coffee interruptus,"" he asserts that the rate of suicide is higher among drinkers of decaf than drinkers of caffeinated coffee. Citation, please!Read this book for its stimulating opinions and lively patter and a sort of pop-sci approach to its subjects. According to its author, this book is intended as a reference work. It's fun to page through, but in order to be a convincing reference work it needs the added muscle of citations and a bibliography."
4,It is straight to me,To me the album is bumpin but people are not talkin about it like they are talkin about Drama and Hypnotize Camp Posse. The best song is buck with me but there isn't a sample of it.
1,Trash,"I bought one at the auto parts store. I found this web listing while looking for the company to complain to them. I test my car's anti-freeze and thought I was good to go. I then rinsed it if clean fresh water in the sink and guess what I learned, my tap water is good to -40*F. This thing will give a 5 ball rating to any thing you test it on."
3,FAT ends,"I originally bought this cord based on the good rep of monster instrument & mic cables and their good build quality. Which is true. But the ends on these cables are simply too fat. Makes it frustrating to plug them in and out of your microphone, with worries of possibly damaging the the microphone itself. Stay away. Another note, the 10' cable is a lot shorter than I would have liked. Connecting my mic to my usb interface about 3 feet apart gave hardly any slack in length. I would consider 15' the best & most flexible for home studio setups.As for quality it is decent enough. Like another reviewer said for the 30' version of these, consider going for the 500 cable if you want quality that lasts. Even with limited lifetime warranty, very seldom will you have a mic cable under $20 that will keep in shape for a good amount of time."
4,Fascinating But Flawed on Freemasonry and Masonic Interpretation,"This is a very fascinating book, and worth reading in many ways. For all its virtues it is seriously flawed and misinformed on the subject of Mozart and Freemasonry. I have recently published an article which argues at length with some of Till's contentions, and presents a more informed view of Freemasonry in relation to this great man. It can be read on the Masonic Music site, under Mozart: A Resolution of Mozart and Freemasonry: Enlightenment and the Persistence of Counter-Reformation By Peter Paul Fuchs, 32nd Degree in PDF."
4,Plague time,Excellent book- stirs up controversy on chronic illnesses and thier possible viral et.al. causes. A must read.Dr. Ewald's ideas need a wide readership. I urge others to read his book and research his ideas.
4,Great Pick of Music but poor quality recording,"This CD has a great selection of classical music. My six week year old son loves the music. However, quality of the recording is very poor. I have had tapes that have better quality. If quality is not an issue this is a great selection."
4,Mr. Wong - Both of them?,"Until I received this DVD set, I did not realize that Keye Luke played Wong in the last film. A very pleasant surprise (he even got the girl) indeed.The transfer on most of the films was decent, but Doomed for Death was in pretty rough shape. Given the condition that some of the old Monogram films are found, it is really hard to complain about that.Karloff fans will want this set to complete his filmography, but they are also getting some decent murder mysteries as well.Enjoy everyone!"
3,A Fine Underrated Mystery,"When a shipping magnate is found murdered in a locked room, the famous Chinese detective James Lee Wong goes to work find the killer and the seemingly impossible method of murder. Monogram Studios was obviously capitolizing on the success of 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto films when they decided to make this film, but had the good sense to hire Boris Karloff, who brought his usual polish and charm to the role of Mr. Wong. Monogram, one the so-called ""poverty row"" studios, thought enough of Karloff (and the film) to give him a strong supporting cast and an intriguing mystery story to work with. The result is no classic, but still a very entertaining film that proved Karloff was much more than just a ""boogeyman.""By the way, the plot was good enough that, several years later, Monogram reused it for one of THEIR Charlie Chan films!"
2,"Good Prints, But a Forgettable Series","When Monogram recruited Boris Karloff for its ""Mr. Wong"" series in 1938, the studio apparently believed that the horror icon's presence would be strong enough to carry its low-budget product. They were sadly mistaken and the series folded in 1940 after six films, with Karloff appearing in only five of them. (Interestingly, Keye Luke played a younger version of the Chinese detective in the final installment.) Time has not been kind to the ""Mr. Wong"" series. These mysteries are deadly dull and have virtually nothing to offer except the sincerity of Karloff's performances. On the plus side, these are the best prints you are likely to find. Still, Karloff's association with Monogram was less distinguished than Bela Lugosi's run during the early 1940s. Even Bela's ""Mysterious Mr. Wong"" (no relation) is more entertaining than the dreary exploits of James Lee Wong."
3,DVD Bundle NOT a box set,"Quiet detective Mr. Wong solves some interesting stories. Not as much fun as Mr. Moto or Charlie Chan, but still worth watching. 6 individual DVD movies with cases and artwork, but they are not housed in a cardboard cover set anymore."
4,Better than average B mystery,"As a fan of all things black and white, I found Mr Wong to be above average. Of course, ""average"" in B movies was pretty dreadful, but Boris Karloff alone raised the value of the films. That, and using the original stories for the basis of the screenplays added quite a bit to the quality. The stereotype of Grant Withers as the dumb flatfoot detracted more from the films than the stereotype of Karloff as the inscrutable Chinese detective. But overall, worth the very low price of admission."
3,MR. WONG MOVIES ONE STEP DOWN FROM CHARLIE CHAN,"MR. WONG MOVIES MADE BY MONOGRAM PICTURES AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE CHARLIE CHAN MOVIES ARE A STEP BELOW CHAN'S BUT PLOT AND MYSTERY ARE GOOD IN THEM,AND EVEN THOUGH EVERYTIME THEY CALL CAPT. STREET (GRANT WITHERS)ON THE PHONE HE IS ALWAYS SITTING IN HIS CHAIR JUST WAITING FOR THE CALL IT'S CHEAP BUT OK THEY ARE SHORT AND SO MANY ACTORS THAT WE SEE THROUGH OUT THE 1930'S IN A JOY.tHE FIRST ONE IS ONE OF THE BEST. THE OTHERS ARE ALSO GOOD AND THE LAST ONE WELL I'LL WAIT FOR ANOTHER REVIEW FROM RICH SPANBURGH ""50'S GURU"""
3,A bit intense,A fun series of movies - not as well made as the Mr Moto or Charlie Chan. It's fun to watch Boris Carloff in a very unusual role - he is certainly intense in every performance.
3,It Stinks - but I love it,"I first saw GALLERY many years ago on WPIX - Channel 11 Chiller Theater, and it stuck with me. It's brash, colorful, mostly well paced, and very amateurishly acted and directed.John Carradine (somebody fix his bow tie, please?) introduces 5 comic book type stories all delivered on a junior high school level. Lots of ""location"" footage lifted from Corman's THE TERROR (who likely swiped it from somewhere else too) - endless horse-drawn carriage scenes with lurid voice overs.Add a sad-sack Lon Chaney Jr. and you've got yourself a must for bad movie buffs: cheesy but rarely boring, and if you're my age, you'll feel like you're 10 years old again."
3,So bad it's good,"I remember watching this movie many years ago on television when it was called ""Return From The Past"". The noted film critic Leonard Maltin said in his review of it: ""Should be returned to the past and never shown again"". But for fans of horror legends John Carradine and Lon Chaney, Jr. and enjoyably bad low-budget horror films, it is priceless. One other reviewer said it has the production values of a poor high school play. Still, I remembered it for all of these many years. Personally, I have seen big budgeted films with big name casts that I have enjoyed far less. If you like movies that are so bad they are good then you will love this one and have a lot of fun with it."
3,For Game Boy Color only,"It worked pretty well with the Game Boy; it doesn't seem to make a very secure connection with the charger, but an LED lights when charging. The supplied batteries have a longer-than-normal positive tip to make contact with the replacement battery door, so it may not work with other rechargeables. I haven't used the Game Boy Color in a while, but I still use the discharge mode to condition batteries before putting them in another charger."
5,Crazy Fun,I have played the board game version several times but recently played the DVD game with my husband and some friends. The DVD was completely interactive unlike some of the other claimed DVD games. The game allows the player to stay within their comfort zones yet push boundaries they are comfortable with. It is a great way to get to know people and is a super fun way to spend an evening.
5,Speechless...,"This is one of the best albums that i have bought in a long time. The guitar riffs are superb and the drumming is more varied than on Enter the Moonlight Gate. The use of the female vocals are well placed and not overdone, creating a peaceful yet cruel sounding atmosphere at times. There is a bit more death metal vibe in alot of the songs with more breakdowns and interesting song structures, hell even some decent solos are mixed in. I could go on for awhile longer, but hell, just do yourself a favor and get this monolith of an album!!"
2,Am I Missing Something Here?,"I read the reviews before I purchased the DVD. Most of the previous reviewers gave this a 5 star rating. I've never seen nor heard of this film, and after watching it, I can see why. It feels like a low budget, thrown together film with actors that had other jobs at the same time (notice the hair on these men?) Wilde looks like he's never held a pistol before, and those tanks...WWII vintage??The japs in the rear don't even act like they've been invaded. Drawing pictures of plants, sitting around eating rice, etc.To its credit (thus not just 1 star), some of the graphic scenes are a ""first"". And there is a nude scene in one flashback.Finally, the ultimate test. After watching about 15 minutes, my son asked ""how much longer is this""? 'Nuff said."
2,Second Rate,"Second rate writing, second rate direction, second rate acting, second rate photography. Overall, a real disappointment. Save your money and your time."
2,A Shadow,Just a shadow of an attempt. It was a nice attempt but only shadows the achievement made in A Thin Red Line or the most recent Eastwood combo of Flags of Our Brothers and Letters from Iwo Jima. It's obvious they tried to keep the overhead cost low by using old footage. Nice try.
1,Nope,"I would pass on this one, a real dud of you ask me, just was not able to stay with it at all.... I would pass."
5,Hard-boiled W.W.II movie that pulls no punches.,"Beach Red is finally out on video. One of the best films about World War II and it's made by people who were there.This movie was produced by film companies from Japan, U.S.A. and the Philipines. Cornell Wilde stars and directs this film that inspired The Thin Red Line remake and Saving Private Ryan. Rip Torn co-stars as a battle harden sergant who uses unorthodox techniques to get information from his p.o.w.s. A grim film that was way ahead of it's time. Terrance Mallick must have really loved this movie, The Thin Red Line is virtually a remake. Go out and get the extended version of Big Red One as well, Two highly underrated films about World War II.I guarantee full satisfaction."
3,Flawed but worth seeing once,"The cornpone dialogue doesn't always ring true and the editing is terrible, but ""Beach Red"" is one of the first movies to capture the realism of modern combat, and the range of emotions of the soldiers involved. I can't recall an earlier movie that showed cameramen traveling with the troops, though they obviously did in real life, or that showed Japanese soldiers, not as mindless fanatics, but as ordinary men thrust into combat, just palling around like ordinary dudes before the battle. The overall tone reminds me of ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" not as well-done overall but with effective moments. What this film really needed and lacked was a good editor to smooth out the rough spots, of which there are many. But despite its flaws there's a sense of tension, realism and horror here that was lacking in most war movies up to that time, and which foreshadowed war movies to come. So in that respect ""Beach Red"" was ahead of its time."
3,Simple reading,The story was simple and moved along nicely. One could almost guess the ending. I have read better books by this author.
