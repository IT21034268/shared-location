2,Tried it,"Tried it with an open mind, but after 3 weeks of 2 a day, can't see ANY difference in energy or libido. Didn't work for me."
3,This works for me,Stamazide is helping me in the intimacy department and also I feel stronger and more energetic overall.
4,Stamazide,"This product is ok but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Don't think it works as advertised, but it may work differently on others."
4,Stamazide 4 star review,I feel this product has helped me regain my sex drive and stamina during intercourse. Very helpful to my ego.
4,Great product- Stamazide,I will keep using it. Have had the most incredible experience using it. By that I mean that I am well into my 60's and it gave me that little extra something that I had lost. Thank nyou.
4,Very effective product,This stamazide has changed my life for the better. I feel manly again- thank you.
3,Stamazide,I give this product 75% credit for my newfound sex drive and stamina. The other percent goes to a more active lifestyle and a pleasant divorce.
3,I heard this was best to take for male performance,I am older now and needed the extra zest and I found it with stamizide.
4,For the mid-teens,"I did not buy this book but I mananged to flip through it in the bookstore. Each chapter is very short (average 2 - 3 pages, if not shorter). Each chapter comes with a cartoon and each section ends with ""In A Nutshell""I am 19 and I find that this book is suitable for teenagers in the 13 - 16 age group. Ideal for teens who has yet to find their identity and help them solve their problems.Buy this book if you have no time to finish it in the bookstore!"
5,An awesome STAR is Heather Nova! A Galaxy of a singer/songwriter!,"Heather Nova is one of the most intensely amazing ""finds"" that I've discovered in years. This live album is just superb and I agree with what the other reviewers here have said, in tossing so many heartfelt accolades toward this singer/songwriter!All of her music is both impressive and incredible, but many of the cuts on this live album are exemplary of some of her very best work. ""Light Years"", now who would have thought that ANY singer could metaphorically use her voice to make the listener FEEL what ""light years"" means....So if you think you know what musical talent is really all about, and what musical creativity is all about, think again! Because Heather is out there on the fringes where some of the finest, most beautiful music, resides...."
3,Great movie,"This play was good.I would recommend this play to be showed in youth groups, small groups and with families.This play will make great conversation as to how we are to walk out our Christian walk.Family is a vital. Whether a mother is raising children alone, a family dealing with a teenage children crossing into adulthood, or dealing with relationships, without God things are impossible.The mistakes we make in life, holding onto old relationships, or just not productive relationships all effect our walk with the Lord and those around us.God is a redeemer which is highlighted in the movie at the end."
4,A record enshrouded in mystery . . . .,"This record has one of the most beautiful album covers you'll see--an ornate Chinese painting against an eye-catching chartreuse background--but the artist's name is nowhere to be found anywhere on the cover. And it's difficult to find her name inside, too. Commercial suicide? Deliberate obfuscation? Whatever her motives, Cynthia Dall has made an intriguingly atmospheric record with the simplist of ingredients: some spooky piano or zither, some minimalist guitar or percussion, and some disturbing minor-key songs. Cynthia's rather girlish (and appealing) vocals, and an unpolished production that sounds more like demos than a finished record place this squarely in the indie camp--a good thing in my book. (It is on Drag City, after all.) I would highly recommend this to fans of Lisa Germano, the April March record that April did with Los Cincos, and any other mildly depressed female singer-songwriters. A good listen for a cloudy afternoon. . . . ."
5,This Barbarian Speaks,"I love this book! I actually bought it at Tower books based on the title alone. Anyone who has experienced the frustration of every history of the Celts simply parroting Julius Caesar (like listening to George Custer explain Native American culture), and ignoring the extant evidence from the Celtic world itself will understand the allure of this title. I refer to Peter wells as part of the ""New Celtic Scholarship"" and I use this book as a reference often. It's a bit academic to read, but for any serious lover of Celtic history and culture, this is a must have for your library! I only hope more archeologists will have the integrity and courage to follow in his footsteps and get real about Celtic research.Michael R. Gorman"
1,What a crock!,"The author has a very vivid imagination, I'll give him that. The only problem is that this book was written as nonfiction!"
5,Their Best,"This is their best album ever, musically and lyrically, period. I am a huge fan of the TKK and I have every one of their albums and several singles. I am very happy with this one and it was worth the wait. A must buy for new or old fans."
4,Red Krayola - 'Hazel' (Drag City),"Reason I'm giving this later day Red Krayola (1996)release a four star rating, is because it grew on me within the first two times I played it. I mean, I was almost sure that 'Hazel' would indeed suck rocks, glad to see that I was totally wrong. One thing I'll give Red Krayola mastermind Mayo Thompson is the man had most certainly, virtually created his 'own' brand of music. True, 'Hazel' is quite experimental. Perhaps too much so for most. But, at least it's got a purpose. Tracks I dug the most were ""I'm So Blase"", the avant garde ""Duke Of Newcastle"", ""Decaf The Planet"" (reminds me of Daevid Allen), ""GOA"", the one-minute snippet ""Hollywood"" and ""Father Abraham"". Give this one a try."
2,The Mahalia Jackson Collection on DVD-Passport Prod.,"Unfortunately this dvd is a compilation from the original 4 volumes of Mahalia sings and the M.J. sings the songs of christmas on Xenon Pictures, contains only 13 of the 14 songs sung by Mahalia and only 41 min. long, black and white. New on dvd are 'Silent Night' and 'Oh come all ye faithful'.Sound and picture-quality are not better as on thevhs-tapes of the real Mahalia Jackson Collection available from Xenon Pictures."
4,Very nice.,"I got the gloves a day early. Not only do they look absolutely awesome, they keep my hands very warm. The metal on the gloves isn't scratch proof, so be careful. Don't use them to block anything. If you have big fingers and/or hands these gloves might not fit you, the wrist is adjustable but the rest is not.Pros:-Warmth-Looks CoolCons:-Stiching for the gloves isn't too good, I gave one of the fingers a light pull and it started to give, and one of the strings broke. All the other stiching seemed fine.-The gloves are a little hard to take off.Use these for plain wearing, not for anything like parkour."
2,Biting Remarks,"It is Puma&#65533;s first day of school, and he is continuously biting the tails of all of his classmates. When the other animals in his class trick him, Puma is caught and unable to say his recurring phrase, &#65533;It wasn&#65533;t me!&#65533; Written for young children beginning school, Willis and Birchall try to convince the listener that biting is painful and unacceptable behavior. Their attempt is unsuccessful especially since Puma was biting for fun. Young children, who have never been biters, might put Puma&#65533;s actions into play and begin biting because it is fun. The fact the he is sneaking up on all of his &#65533;victims&#65533; shows that he is attempting to be devious. Not the best book for using with young children who need to be convinced to stop biting."
2,Fun but useless after less then 10 pulls,"its a lot of fun at first, but after about 10 pulls the rubber ripped and we had to make some ""army"" adjustments to it. Worked great after that... for now."
3,Far-flung Story of the American West,"I remember this series from the '70's, and loved it then. I'd be delighted to buy the DVD's, but since Closed Captioning (cc) isn't listed, I will not. What's the chance this product can be updated to include Closed Captioning?"
5,Centennial DVD,"Excellent quality. Very pleased. Would do business with this company again. Also, came fast."
4,Bought for a gift.,I bought one as a Christmas gift and one for myself but have not yet watched it. I'm sure it will meet our expectations.
3,centennial,"I enjoyed watching the series and it has been a long time since I've seen it, but it seemed like some scenes were left out. For instance when Jacque Pasquenel was a small child he was cut on the face in a fight scene at a rendevous. That was when part of his hatred began and explained alot of his later behavior. I don't remember seeing it in my new series and I know it was in the original. I was glad to be able to finally get this movie back again though. Thanks Valerie Fitzgerald"
3,No chapter Breaks,"In a series that is some 20 hours long, it should have had chapter breaks (there are none!). The scenes are broken down into about 1 hour segments. This is far too long and it makes it impossible to pick up where you left off if you remove a disc (there are 6) for any reason. You can only get to within an hour of where you were. In an epic this long, they should have made a chapter break about every 10 minutes or so."
5,One of the best mini series ever produced,"For someone who loves American history as much as I do, I highly recommend checking this EPIC of a movie out. The portrayal of the American west from 1795 to the present day was absolutely stunning. Although the names are fictitious some events in the movie did happen. For instance, the rendevous of the early 1800's and the horrible massacre in the 1860's. The acting, I thought, was superb on all counts. The best part was at the end of the series, where they did a restrospect of all the previous episodes. Check it out!!!"
5,the world's greatest mystery.....,"is why the hell Centennial isn't available on dvd. I saw it on tv here in ireland when i was a kid and have longed to see it again ever since. Lonesome Dove is the closest i've been able to get to it but i still want to see centennial again.also, does anyone know if the mini-series 'How the west was won' starring james arness is available on dvd? I'd love to see that again too."
5,"Great then, Great now.",I saw this series when it premiered on TV. It seems even more enjoyable now. It is a superb adaptation of James Michener's book of the same name. I recommend it for Western fans or history buffs.
5,Centennial The Complete Series,"I loved it , was sad when it all ended. The movie was well done and DVD's were in excellent condition. A keeper"
5,I am not alone!,"Wow, I thought I was the only person in the UK to remember this excellent mini-series.Nobody I've ever mentioned it to seems to remember it but I thought it was the best ever - along with Roots of course.Will it ever come to DVD?"
3,Quality of DVD - Poor,"I have always loved watching Centennial from the days when it was originally broadcast on television, then on VHS and now on DVD. However, the quality of the DVD we received through Amazon was very poor. Lots of skipping on the discs and this was from the very first use. I verified it was not our DVD player - definitely the CDs."
3,Centeninal,"The picture quality was very good but the menu only gave two choices, the opening scene of each chapter on each disk. That meant that too much time was spent finding a pick-up point if an entire chapter was not viewed at one sitting.Otherwise a great buy."
5,CENTENNIAL by James Michener,What an AWESOME depiction of the Old West. One of my ALL TIME FAVORITES.HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MAGNIFICENT MOVIE ISN'T AVAILABLE ON DVD??? I WILL BE AMONG THE FIRST TO ORDER IT.
2,centennial,"Centennial The Complete Series a fair movie, however it is NOT complete. I own a copy of this movie on vhs and ALOT of minutes are missing. The dvd Centennial isn't as good as the original vhs version. That's why I only gave it rating of 2. Redo the DVD version series and put all the minutes back in like the vhs version and it will be a five rating to me."
5,A thought provoking view of how the past affects the future,"I thought this production was a wonderful depiction of the development of the west, and more specifically Colorado, was Very Well done!. There are many great acting performances by many great actors, most of which are no longer with us. I think it should be seen in every us history classroom. I wish it would air again on National Prime time TV. I will buy it, when it is released on DVD."
5,CENTENNIAL DESERVES TO BE ON DVD,"It is a perfect example of television producing a product that could only be done by that medium. It needs no more praise than what is offered in other reviews.What is needed is a DVD of the entire series, not the first twelve parts."
5,CENTENNIAL - THE COMPLETE SERIES (DVD),"In my opinion this work is one of the all time best. Michener's genius cannot be denied. If you were like me - and watched the original - you could not wait for it to be re-released. I placed my order almost a year before distribution date.This DVD series does not disappoint. One of the greatest epics ever produced. Tremendous cast of actors. There is a portion of one DVD which contains interviews with the main actors discussing the ""making of"".If you care about the origins of our country and the people who first blazed the trails for the rest of our ancestors to follow --you will want to own and watch this (over and over).I can guarantee you will never regret the addition of this work to your video library. A MUST SEE AND A MUST HAVE."
5,Awesome adventure,"This epic is the best since Gone with the Wind. Watching it is like being there and moving through 100 years of history. I have purchased several of these movies as gifts and had the people I gave them to call me and thank me a hundred times for the adventure this movie gave them. Loved Pasquinel and McKeag!!! along with all the characters in this totally awesome, history packed, adventure packed epic. What a value also for this mini-series.Thanks for it's release.Loving it in Jacksonville, Florida and Hazlehurst, Georgia"
4,Close to Excellent,"Much has been said about the series per se (the plot, actors, etc). My comments are really about the quality of the transfer. First, the DVD is much better than the VHS version. But there are some bothersome flaws. I'm not at all a video expert, but I doubt there should be dust flecks! The sharpness is much improved but still not razor sharp in some cases (I know it's from the late 70's but that's really not that old). And you can detect what looks like grain in some shots. But it's the dust that looses that 5th star.None the less, it's much improved over the VHS and I love the story."
4,"Excellent transfer, Excellent story telling.","Transfer to DVD excellent. Sound was not that good to begin with, and has not improved, but you know, it's a TV movie, so what do you expect. The story is Michener at his best, which makes all 20+ hours great. The acting is uneven - the good TV actors are very good, and the bad TV actors are, well, bad. Conrad good, Ansara good, Karras good, Harrison good, Pleaseence good, Keith good, Jannsen good, Chamberlin good, Weaver good. The rest are so so."
3,Disappointing,I have read the book and loved it so much that I looked forward to watching the DVD. It could have been a lot better.
2,Book is MUCH better,"Unfortunately, the screen play for this series is soap opera quality. If you have never read the book, you might get some enjoyment out of this. For those who have loved the book, this adaptation of Michener's work will probably be disappointing."
3,Could be better,"Have been waiting for this to come out on video since it was originally on TV. Very excited to order it. Don't know if it is the player I am using in the rented condo or if it is the disks, but it is very difficult to index and play in sequence. The quality isn't as great as it could be either"
2,centennial,"thought it would be a good series but i was wrong, i really did not like it i gave it away"
4,Good entertainment,"This series of episodes about the building of the town Centennial is good entertainment for long winter evenings. True to James Michener's style of writing in depth, this story begins way back before the Indians and comes forward to modern day hustle-bustle living. My only real disappointment was that the jacket says there is bonus footage of interviews with the actors, but it is nowhere to be found on any of the six disks. Also I suspect the book contains many more details than the film does. For example, on the last two video chapters I had the feeling they missed something. Some of the characters just slip away and they strain to bring everything to a quick conclusion. But for general entertainment, it's good!"
5,Outstanding Literary Treasure,"...so glad I finally added the complete DVD series of this fabulous story to my collection of Mitchener's works. I made a copy of the series on video tapes when the show appeared on TV years ago. It was such a thrill viewing this new DVD version that wasn't such a hit and miss, ad filled, mess. Thanks to Amazon.com the price was very reasonable and the shipping process, quick and easy."
5,Loved this 31 years ago love it now,"I first read the book. Was great. Then when it came out as a mini series I enjoyed it also, only I missed some parts. Was unable to watch every night.When I got the DVD I ended up watching the whole thing in 3 days. When I find the time again will watch it again. To me this was worth buying"
4,Good Gift for an Avid History or Western Frontier Fan,"I gave this set as a Christmas gift to someone who's an avid Western movie/tv lover (John Wayne, Bonanza)and it was a big hit. For the under 35 age-group who only know cable television, this miniseries may seem hokey or corny. But the stories are compelling for those of us that remember great mini-series on TV in the 70's like Roots and The Thornbirds--and watching some of the well-known TV actors like Richard Chamberlin (the king of the miniseries!), Robert Conrad and Andy Griffith, among others in this series, made for fun reminiscing about their own shows and movies we remembered."
5,Great!!!,It was my favorite when it was on years ago.Its great to relive it again. Its a great story.They do not make them like that anymore.Thanks.
5,Centennial DVD needed,"This video was one of the exceedingly rare times the viewing was almost as good as the reading. Anyone not having reviewed the book before seeing the tapes would still have retained the focus of Mr. Michener's theme, while the settings filmed and characters acted were among the finest television ever offered. PLEASE MAKE THIS INTO A DVD!"
5,A Snapshot of History,"I had been looking for this in some kind of format for years! I have owned it for over 2 years, and many of my friends have borrowed it and complained about being unable to sleep as they can't wait to find out what happens next. Pasquinel, McKeag, Levi Zendt, Hans Brumbaugh, Jim Lloyd and Oliver Seccombe live through the growing years of a small town in Colorado that is born on the heels of the death of young bride, and grows to be a prosperous community. While I grew tired of the Wendells, someone had to be the greedy tirants. The series is a little boring in the middle, but the first 4 tapes are absolutely superb. By far my favorite mini-series."
2,centennial the DVD,"I have only viewed the 1st 2 discs of this ""complete"" set of 6 discs. There are several important scenes from the original movie that are missing!! Not sure why, but I am returning the set and going to order the vhs version of the movie."
5,suprise christmas present,I have been waiting for Centennial to come out on dvd. My husband told me years ago he wanted it. He saw it many years ago and liked it very much. I'm suprising him for Christmas.
5,American TV Classic on DVD,"This DVD set is a dramatization of James A. Michener's epic novel about a fictious Colorado town (not the real Centennial CO) modeled losely after Greeley CO, incorporating many incidents and colorful characters under mostly fictitious names. Colorado Militia Col Chivington, the monster perpetrator of the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, is renamed Skimmerhorn, for example. One could infer that the lusty admirable Pasquinal is modeled after Sacajewea's mate, Toussaint Charbonneau. This is a truly worthy set of DVDs that every lover of the American West should watch, and share with their children. It is also the Life Best Work many notable Actors of all races, celebrating the wonder of the American Dream, and displaying some of the warts of America's story. If you have never seen Centennial, you are missing a work of cinematic art."
3,"Great book , reasoanble movie","I recall seeing this on a black and white screen in Australia in 1979.The book is all encompassing, and I do not expect that any movie could do it justice. In the case of the DVD version, the image quality varies considerably between acceptable and very grainy. Two of the six discs exhibited problems. I had to skip ahead over one scene. I tried to play the disc on another player as well as my laptop and the same problem occured. As I live in Australia and the DVD set came form the USA, return postage almost outweighs the cost of the set I received.If you buy the set, please ensure that the cost of returning the goods are not unreasonable."
4,Centennial: The Complete Series,I saw Centennial when it first came out on television and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it again on DVD. The one concern I have however is that I can't seem to find the BONUS FEATURES - Memories of Centennial. Can anyone tell me how to access them? Which of the six discs are they on? I was so looking forward to the cast and crew member's remarks.
5,Centennial the miniseries,"The book Centennial by James Michener has long been a favorite of ours, so when the mini series was shone on tv, we were naturally drawn to watch it. It was very well done and the acting was good. All the actors seemed to fit their parts perfectly. When the mini series finally came out in VHS, we bought it and about wore out the tapes. When we saw it on DVD, we had to have it. This will be in our library and watched over and over for many years to come."
3,Not bad but not complete,"I remember this from when it was first broadcast on TV as being a pretty good version of one of my favorite books, so I was looking forward to having a chance to see it all again. Too bad they didn't put it all into the CD set, there are huge gaps in the story and it is disjointed and sometimes very confusing. The acting is pretty good and what you get to see is alright but if anyone had not seen the original and this set was all they had to go on they would only get about half the strory.Very unhappy with the set but decided to keep it anyway."
5,Good as I remembered,This series was just as good as I remembered. I have wondered why this has not been reshown on TV cable stations.
5,The Best Mini-Series EVER!!!,"Centennial has always been my favorite book and television mini-series. We don't have cable (I know, hard to believe, but our choice) and since it's only shown on WTBS, I haven't seen it in years. My husband got it for me this past Christmas (I've asked for it the last 2 years) and I think I've gotten my kids hooked. All the characters are so well presented. My favorites are Levi Zendt and Pasquinel."
5,Centennial,"Love the series, amazon was amazing, I had not ordered in awhile and had an old address on my account, thought I had changed it but it went to the old address and was returned to them. They contacted me and sent another one out - no charge to me. Very impressive!"
5,Great dvd's,"Havbing had the VHS set of the series I ordered the dvd set because of space and technical issues the dvd set.The quality of these dvd is great, I would call it digitally remastered. And the size fits perfectly the book shelfAnd the content it self is a masterpiece of american history."
5,Centennial: The Complete Series,This is a great series for anyone who wishes to understand America and the Pioneers.
3,Centenial,I rated this 3 star because I feel that it was not the complete series as advertised.I watched this on TV many years ago and really enjoyed it but this seems abrigded.Klaus
5,centennial series,I have had this series on video for about 12 yrs now and watch it every year... I rate this as one of my most prized movies... afraid that it will not last and would love to have it on dvd... please advise when available.
5,A great buy,I could not find this item anywhere else for less money. On the store websites it will cost you MUCH more.
4,Wonderful,"This set of DVD's is an excellent effort. I read Michener's Centennial twice, and must say that this miniseries closely follows the story. The only reason I did not give it 5-stars is because the last sections relied so heavily on flashbacks--I had already seen all the footage. Still, this is a wonderful production."
5,Worth a day and change of your life.,"Centennial was the reason I took Englist Literature 2 in high school to watch a poorly dubbed Betamax to VHS copy of the second half of Centennial, (Mr. Reed OHHS suckered us by ""making us watch it"" every Friday in Lit 1). Skip ahead 20 years and a clear DVD copy brings me right back. 27 hours of mini series for less than 50 bucks, and you get a neat box that looks like a book, that'll impress your friends, right?"
4,Excellent Soft Hair Brush for the money,"I bought two of these. One for Black and one for Brown. I use them both every weekend. I can't really compare them as prior to buying these brushes, I went to Nordstrom every week for shoe shines.I can't think of much to say about a shoe brush but I will say this. This appears to be of fine, durable quality and it doesn't scratch the shoes. Every Monday, when I start my workweek, I feel well-groomed and well-dressed, thanks, in part, to these brushes and top quality Allen Edmonds Shoe Cream type polish.I'm only giving 4 stars because I haven't compared to any others.You can buy this brush with confidence."
5,My favorite blend,"Of the five blends of Yerba Mate I've tried, this is my favorite. This yeilds a strong and rich mint flavor and is intensely more satisfying than regular tea. It is also certified organic, and does produce desireable effects. I sip it hot or cold all throughout the day, and I feel invigorated and able to think with clarity. Also, after just two days of including Yerba Mate in my diet, I lost 8 pounds! Try any of the flavors...the cocoa (chocolate) blend is good as well."
4,update of old school grooves from chicago to nyc heydays,DJ Danny Wang has a completely straight take on the concept of the groove--i.e. built from the ground up starting with the bass and kick drum in the tradition of old school house from chicago early eighties and even earlier influences like the Paradise Garage in New York's underground disco heydays--with a nod to the dramatic and rigid codes of the Vogue scene of which he used to be an active member--DJ for House of Chanel no less--and this compliation is his first cd after a string of vinyl hits that he released on his own label and which were more recognized on the other side of the Atlantic as is often the ironic case with homegrown boys--now his work boomerangs back Stateside with this collection and rightly so--recommended track is the first one but any of them bears up to listening either on the dancefloor or at home since his analysis and application of the history of groove quest is solid and hits the mark in a satisfying way
3,ITS GOOD IF IT FITS,"I bought this bracket to replace the mounting bracket of my 1997 Acura 3.0 CL due to frozen pins. I went to the site and inquired about compatibility issues and they said it would fit. The quality of product is good but when I was putting it on, I found out that it was not compatible with my vehicle. I returned it and received 100% refund. This is good, if it fits."
4,"Great Band, Great Music!","I bought this after buying Iron Will (their most recent release). That disc is in the top 10 all time for me, so I went back and started buying their older stuff. It is different, not as ""classic"" metal as Iron Will is, but still outstanding.This guy actually sings, not growls, like other singers today. Guitars are great. All the tracks are keepers.Enjoy!"
3,okay i paid that much for this!!!!!,if you want to get this ramp lets hope you know how to ollie because if you dont you cant launch off of it you will slam your skateboards nose and if you want to go down the ramp you have to drop in risking falling backwords but if your go to use a bike on the ramp then you can get tons of air i recomend buying the fly box if your using it for skateboards
3,Need the full ramp,"This was a gift to my grandkids ages 6 & 10. They had differculties with the half ramp, maybe being so young and not knowing how to use 1/2 ramp correctly. My son is ordering the other half of the ramp hoping this would help my youngest grandson from twisting. I'm sure he isn't sure what he is doing but he loves the ramp and keeps trying and trying. Actually, he brings the ramp in the house when not in use so he knows where it is all the time. He is a very active grandchild and when he likes something, he does take very good care of it. I am very glad I made this purchase for him."
1,Terrible Even for a Cheap Wig,"This came out of the bag in pieces... long strands of hair everywhere. I know it's a cheap wig, but this was beyond anything.I tried to fix it and make it into something resembling a bee hive, but eventually tossed this in the trash in frustration. It was a nylon net with a ball tied on the back, and then random loose strands of long blond hair sticking out in various directions. If it comes disassembled, you would think they would at least have directions on how to put it together.My review of this can be summed up in one word: YUCK."
4,Maybe you should read the book before writing a review,"To the person who says that the US doesn't care for democracy, maybe you should read the book. He clearly states in his essay that the reason for the book is that it seems fairly clear to him that the message we are sending out with our foreign policies and even our domestic policies is that we don't care about democracy or perhaps just choose to give it lip service. And it's about time that we started to take it as seriously as we say we do.One look at the conservative agenda and their new stance of calling any dissent treason (see ann coulter, et al) and the dismissal of true democratic notions seems more clear than ever.Let's get back to writing reviews for edification rather than merely pointing out our own ideologies.It's an intelligent questioning book that will hopefully meet its obvious agenda about raising the level of our discourse on the subject of terror, security and above all, democracy."
1,Cold war liberalism dusted off against a new enemy,"This collection of essays amounts to a ringing endorsement of George W. Bush's foreign policy or--alternatively--John Kerry's ""multilateral"" version of the same thing.None of them question the right of the USA to police the world. During the 1980s Berman backed the Nicaraguan contras. In the 1990s he defended NATO bombing in the Balkans. His latest crusade against Moslems angered at Western oil companies bleeding their countries dry is obviously to be expected.Todd Gitlin is well-known for his attacks on 1960s radicals who refused to back Hubert Humphrey for President. Such a proclivity for warmaking Democrats would lead one to question whether he truly understands the meaning of patriotism. Peace and noninterference are far more patriotic than flag-waving and war-whooping.Kanan Makiya is an Iraqi intellectual who was on the front lines urging war in Iraq. And so on.This book is not worth the paper it is written on."
5,Great Reading!,The book is hard to put down! I am the kind of reader that looses interest easy but not with this book. The story is great and it relates to real life. The characters seemed like people I knew and I couldn't wait to see how things would turn out. The message in the story is one that all families can benefit from.To me this book could be enjoyed by all age levels. I hope that the author has more books to come. A sequel to this one would be good!
5,These Grimms Make you Grin!,"This is one classic that will put a grin on your face over and over. It's a delightful collection, and not just for kids, but for anyone who wants a little light escapism. Much is made of the violence, but it is so cartoonishly over the top and karmically justified that I doubt it seriously disturbing to even children, who can see worse on t.v. in an hour's time anytime. What is amazing to me is how much of the basis this book is for Disney's classics and other animated films. This is a book that has truly lived in various forms on screen and other entertainments for ages. Nice to read something that is just plain fun, full of little twists and turns. As classics go, it is timeless."
2,Grimm's Fairy Tales,"I must have been the only person who didn't realize that many of Disney's stories were straight from the Grimm brothers. I found many of the stories contained throughout the book to be similar. Three brothers, princesses, people turned into animals, after a while everything blended together. After you've read the first five stories you can just stop, because everything else is very repetitious."
5,Stolen Chinese antiques + 3 years old mystery = Nancy Drew!,"This book is very exciting! Once again, Nancy and her friends helped find stolen Chinese antique vases and helped a Chinese gentleman find his friends, who were missing 3 years ago. Can Nancy find the culprit and get the missing people back alive? Read this book and find out."
1,Balloons,The shipping cost me double as much as the balloons them self. I would not recommend to pay those if there is no free shipping
2,An unnecessary enterprise,"This book is, I regret to say, more or less an attempt by Wesleyan University Press to artificially expand their catalog of Cage's works. The observant among you will notice that this same text has already been printed once before, in Bucknell Press's _John Cage at 75_ Wesleyan has played an incredibly important role in promoting Cage's writing for forty years now, but unfortunately this addition was just plain unnecessary.Also note that the text is littered with typographical errors that were not in the original. The layout and overall book design are beautiful however."
3,Rating: Zero or Five?,"OK how about a 3! Five for clarity and one for content. An average of 3. It is equally clear that the position presented will NEVER be embraced by the Church's magisterium. With the election of Josef Cardinal Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI, the final curtain has fallen on the ""Spirit of Vatican II"" fictional drama. Most of the actors in this drama are now toddling about the nursing home garden basking in the memory of times when it looked like they would shape the Church in their image. The real future of the Church is in: The New Faithful: Why Young Adults Are Embracing Christian Orthodoxy (Paperback)To the authors: IF YOU THINK IT IS IMOPORTANT THAT HOMOSEXUALITY BE EMBRACED AS NORMAL, FIND ANOTHER CHURCH! It will not happen in this one."
1,Raymond Weil Parsifal W1 Yellow Stainless & Leather Watch,"Purchased the watch through Amazon from an overseas company in Italy. Watch arrived timely and well packaged, however defective. Chronograph could not be properly programmed and black leather watchband had very musty stale odor as if it was in someone's damp basement for years. I returned the watch for refund and am disputing the restocking fees on the grounds that it was defective."
3,meh... Wasn't impressed,"I sat down with this book pretty excited because it wasn't another teenage vampire drama. I was really into it at first, but only because it was pretty slow going. It was just the anticipation that something would happen that kept me reading. Finally, the climax did happen, but afterwards the book was pretty dull. Nothing really happened, and then in one chapter the author summed up the rest of the protagonist's life. This book lacked real meat, the characters were under-developed, and the story itself could have used more detail. Although this book was supposed to be about ale making, it led to be inconclusive. The author gave the reader old lore and facts about ale in the beginning, then didn't use it later in the book. Ii feel like this book could have been a lot better with a little more detail."
4,Funny and Fast paced,Jill Barnett describes each character so well you are sad when the book ends. The spirit of Lady Clio and her Knight are such that this could take place at any time but with the setting as it is the humor propells you through before you know it is over. I personally loved the confrintation scenes because of how dead on to marital conflicts they can be. Any scene revolving around the making of Ale normally had me rolling on the floor. I've read this book cover to cover at least three times and enjoyed it more and more each time.
1,This book is terrible!!!,Having read the other reviews I can see I have a minority opinion but this is one of the worst romance novels I've ever read. The plot is contrived in the extreme and the characters are cartoonish at best. If I'm suppose to be charmed by the heroine's lack of common sense it must have passed me by. My guess would be that this book should be labeled a write by the numbers effort of an otherwise competent author
4,Another good read by Ms. Barnett,"I bought this book after reading another book by Ms. Barnett, and I wasn't disappointed. Clio was quite funny as were a few other characters in the book. I really thought it was a sweet love story that had heart tugging moments. I do agree with another reviewer and thought that the ending was a little abrupt for me. I felt like I needed something more after that last situation. There is an epilogue that sort of gives you a look into the future years, but I sort of felt a bit cheated, and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. However, very enjoyable, and I really couldn't put it down. I'm on the lookout for my next Jill Barnett book. She's one of my new favorites."
4,adorable!,"This was adorable, one of the best ones i have read by her. Bewitching was by far the most entertaining. This one was so cute, and incredibly romantic. I loved it!"
3,"Good, but","It was good as everyone said it was except for the last bit. The remaining pages just completely lost me. I felt that Jill Barnett rushed the last bit. I would like to know how and where the Welshmen came from. Furthermore, I did not like the hero recovering remarkably and within a matter of pages. It seemed a triffle far-fetched for me. It's a good novel but maybe the feeling of being ""picked up and dropped"" is still fresh on my mind which fell short of giving this novel the complete 5 star rating."
5,A delightful keeper,"I found WONDERFUL to be just that. Ms.Barnett's talent for ""love and laughter"" style romances shines through yet again in this book. Lady Clio and her merry band of misfits will leave you laughing throughout. When Lord Merrick (her husband-to-be) finally returns from his journeys he will learn that as a knight not all battles take place on a battlefield. Clio and Merrick's verbal exchanges are one of the many delightful things that stay with you after the last page has been read. I'm looking forward to WILD,the next book in this medieval trilogy."
3,Nothing special to me...,"This book was entertaining at best. The storyline was shallow, the characters so-so, and the love scenes a little too much at times."
3,"inaccurate heroine, abrupt ending","Lady Clio was immature, pulling stunts that any noble woman of the time would not. Although the hero was slightly more suited, he still was widely inaccurate, such as, not knowing that there would be prep work needed to host the king. Story also ended rather abruptly."
3,"Good ""plane"" read.",This book was an enjoyable way to spend some time in the airport and on the plane. I enjoyed it.
5,John Wayne Last Movie!,This is a great classic movie from John Wayne. I am still a fanof his other movies. So Buy this film because you will love it!
4,"Bittersweet but factual film about the Duke's downfall, a dying gunslinger, because of cancer...","Really a three-and-one-half starfilm on normal 1-4 star rating scale.John Wayne's last film; he succumedto cancer (35 yrs. of smoking) one-and-a-half-yrs. later. Story of dyinggunslinger in his last thros of life,still trying to live life out butyounger men and old rivals stillwant his scalp. Becall is window-dressing. Finally 'The Duke' getsto work with fine Director Don Siegel(Dirty Harry/Play Misty For Me andone more with Clint Eastwood. Comesoff very realistic. Not for the light-hearted. Wayne knew in real life thiswould be his last film. Quite a JohnnyCash-('03'I Hurt')like statement here."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,Unfortunately the movie was unplayable. I tried using two different players and each time failed. I was really disappointed since I had waited a long time to receive the movie in the first place. Sorry.
4,"Simplistic yet warm, and full of action","Not quite the typical John Wayne wins-in-the-end movie; the main character is dying from the start. So he ""wins"" by wrapping up a couple of loose ends in his life and by forming a ""family"" with the widow who runs the boarding house and her son. Its weakness is that most of the ""good"" he does is too superficial to be convincing."
4,What a fitting finale,"Emotionally subtle and especially poignant given Wayne's long career and his own personal battle with cancer. I have never been a big fan of the Duke but, at the same time, thought he was unfairly underrated as an actor. In ""The Shootist"", Wayne is remarkable. It's a thoughtful late period Western that is strikingly unique and different. This is not your typical Duke Wayne horse opera at all. The supporting cast is extaordinary as well and not a single performance is wasted. There is a resonance within everyone in the film, as if they all knew this was to be a very special little gem and a fitting farewell. Wayne's swan song ranks right up there with Henry Fonda's in ""On Golden Pond"". I agree that this is the film that John Wayne should have won the Oscar for."
5,The Duke at his Finest,"Absolutely a great film. Lots of big name actors, great story and excellent direction. Recommended."
3,Very good western with strong three dimensions,The characters in The Shootist are very three dimensional (profanity abounds). The film has a great interesting feel to it. Wayne's deep performance carries it despite a little scene stealing by Jimmy Stewart as a crusty but nice doctor. Westerns are always a little familiar but this one is quite full of originality. A winner.
5,A true (Grit!) classic,"This is a must see of Westerns afficiandos, especially fans of ""the Duke"". It poignantly captures the (historical) watershed transition from the ""western"" era of cowboys, desperadoes and shoot-outs into the dawn of the 20th century capturing the passing (by choice) of an icon into history and out of ""today"". It's worth seeing key cast members making the same transition as others get an earlier start on their careers (Ron Howard)."
5,A true tribute and farewell to the Duke,There could not be a more appropriate last film for this man
1,The Shootist,"When we got this item we were disappointed because we were not able to watch it. I didn't realize when I ordered it that ""Region 2"" meant that it was only able to be viewed in the UK. So, now we have a copy of The Shootist that we are unable to watch. :("
5,A Bittersweet Movie,I think that this is the Best Movie the Duke put out. It has the feeling of reality without a lot of the over the top machoism. It has a fine cast and the film developes naturally. The only bad part is the knowledge that is in the back of your head is that the man is really dying in front of you. I just hope that I go out with the class and dignity that was shown here.A Classic!
5,A must see,"Any one who is a John Wayne fan must see this ""swan song"" movie.Full of great actors, some asked to be in the movie with no pay knowing it would be JW's last."
1,Incomplete At Best,"The point of the story was very vague, the character descriptions so incomplete that I had trouble with whether or not they were male or female in places. The ending left an opening for a second book, but there was never any intention of continuing the characters or their quests. There were points of interesting reading, but many things were never developed."
3,the author got confused ?,"If you like stories, where the author confuses acorns with sycamore seeds then read this and laugh out loud. Further, there is a young hero who usually carries no weapon but is an expert with bow, sling, staff and sword nevertheless. Along with all the archaeological knowledge he has, he is undefeatable. Unbelievable. The lich is the usual stupid enemy that fails to kill the hero, although it had 1 Million opportunities to do so. I did not like the bat, because if it had all the abilities described in this book, why don't they rule the world ?"
1,pure junk,worked once then fell apart. company couldn't even send me a replacement. would not buy this item or deal w/ this seller again
4,2nd favorite Deliverance CD,"This is a great old-school prog metal CD, with fantastic Nevermore/Queensryche-type vocals. It is my 2nd favorite Deliverance CD. However, Deliverance: Stay of Execution, is still the best, though. But this is right behind it. :)"
3,THE FIRST COUPLE OF ALBUMS WERE BETTER!............,"I MANAGED TO ENCOUNTER THE FORCE THAT IS DELIVERANCE IN 1997 WHEN I PICKED UP THREE OF THERE ""SPEED-METAL"" ALBUMS ON CASSETTE.......I MUST SAY THAT WHAT A JOKE IS MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE AND WILL BE UP THERE WITH TOURNIQUETS ""STOP THE BLEEDING"" IN THE SPEED-METAL STAKES.......BUT SADLY THIS ALBUM IS TOO ""ARTY"" FOR ME AND ALAS IS NOT THE DELIVERANCE I GREW TO LOVE......BUT HEY IF YOU FIND THIS IN IT'S ORINGINAL PRESSING VIA ""INTENSE RECORDS"" GRAB IT CAUSE IT IS A COLLECTORS ITEM AND IS STILL ""HEAVY"" FOR ALL THE HEADBANGERS......OH AND IF ANYONE READS THIS AND HAS A COPY OF ""WHAT A JOKE AND THE SECOND ALBUM"" THAT THEY DO NOT WANT LET ME KNOW........"
2,Ok,I was expecting laugh-out-loud lines from this book & I maybe smiled a couple of times. I found the protagonist too annoying & found it hard to believe that someone in her 30's couldn't work things out herself in the relationships she had with men.I do realise that it is supposed to be a toungue-in-cheek look at women & their complexes but I couldn't really identify with the protagonist.The book is easy to read but not very exciting or funny. It is ok if you have nothing else to read and want something very light.
3,"Liked it, didn't love it.","This book is cute, funny, fast-paced and completely over the top when it comes to Jacqueline's self-esteem. I have only known one female in my life to be consumed with her weight so much so that her entire world revolves around it. Her constant weight obsession made the reader almost uncomfortable because it was so extreme. Parts of it were funny, but I found it really hard to identify with and I'm not far from a size 14.It was nice for a light summer read though."
3,"hardly groundbreaking, but...","I love the Fast Show, where the title phrase is used repeatedly. I was surprised to discover that this book was a novel. Anyway, at first it was difficult to read, Jackie was so irritating, but I got used to it. It was an enjoyable read. I think, even though we get irritated by the way Jackie analyses everything in her diary, in real life we do the same ourselves."
3,All Us Girls,An O.K. read for all us girls with less than model bodies. If you are a model don't read this novel. You wont get any of it. Weir hits on point after point that us regular girls can connect with. Entertaining.
1,more appalling than funny,"I picked up this book in Edinburgh as an easy-read for train travel. What a disappointment! I never developed empathy for this self-centered and incredibly insecure character. As woman, I am embarrassed that some of us might actually be like this! The character's personality flaws are exaggerated for (I think) comic effect, but the author fails to humor the reader and succeeds in creating such utter disgust and dislike for the weak ""protagonist."" I wanted to shake the main character and yell, ""Get a grip and get a life! Think of something other than your pathetic self!"""
1,Disapointed,"I was very disapointed with this movie. Manuel Ochoa Lopez is a very good. I have seen him in many other movies and love his acting; but in this movie, although he was very good the story line and most of the other actors were very poor. Boring. The review states that this movie was as good as the previous movie with Pedro Infante- - - NOT True; at least in the previous film the music was very good, and the actors made you feel their heartbreak. The Father, Grandmother, and the priest were very believable, a real tearjerker, and the movie was far more believable and interesting. This movie like so many other remakes, the acting feels like the actors just mimic their parts, making it feel very artificial and boring."
4,"Kevin settles into the role of idiosyncratic, soft rock songwriter.","After the perceived disappointment of ""Sweet Deceiver"", Kevin seems to be comfortable with himself as a matured, off-beat, soft rock composer on his follow-up release. As usual, the performances of his session players are top-notch on ""Yes, We Have No Mananas"" and the songwriting is typical, lovable Kevin. One does miss the experimental element of his earlier work, but having said that, an Ayers pop tune is experimental in lyrical substance to start. Highlights include his remake of ""Falling In Love Again"", the ultra-accessible ""Star"", the transcendental ""Blue"" (with an amazing Ollie Halsall guitar solo) and the oft-maligned but wonderful ""The Owl"". ""Yes, We Have No Mananas"" is an accessible, tuneful record, if not as exciting as Kevin's earlier psychedelic/progressive work."
4,Pretty good,I actually think this is working quite well to restore my hair's ph balance to what it should be. I've only been using it for about a month but I do see an improvement in my hair.
3,Very interesting,"This is a strange, but interesting book. I was annoyed that there are no footnotes nor endnotes to help research the author's facts... The book seems to have a lot of information, and the main thrust appears to be a desire to prove that Augustus, in order to align himself as a deity with previous religious predictions and prophecies, adjusted official chronologies and erased 70 years or so from the historical record.There is a lot of material here but without scholarly notes, as I mentioned, it is difficult to confirm much of what he says.Anyway, a rather interesting book.There seems to be much evidence that Augustus played a large role in the development of Christianity. Another, much more recent book has thoughts on this: See 'Jesus was Caesar' by Francesco Carotta."
5,Super product,"I bought this after I noticed that my baby's bottles smelled like dishwashing liquid after washing with other products. I want my baby's milk to taste & smell like milk, and not have harsh detergents lingering in it. Super product. Have to buy online since my local grocery store stopped selling it. Thank you Amazon!"
5,Can't imagine using something else,"I am glad I bought this Dishwashing Liquid on Amazon. I tried to find it at several health stores and couldn't, so I gave in based on the reviews. I was not disappointed. It just as powerful as any other dishwashing soap unless you are used to something super concentrated, then of course you might have to use a little more. I noticed my hands have not been that dry and that during winter time. My dishes get clean."
5,Excellent product/This price is higher then in my local grocery store,"I highly recommend this product. I also use it as hand soap. It has no sent, its clear and washes off without residue. Good for hands, good for dishes, good for environment, cant get any better. Unfortunately this price is higher per bottle then in my store. Too bad."
3,open bottle mess but good product.,Received a case. One bottle leaked on the rest. Took some time to clean up. Price was a little higher than I could of paid at a local store. Product works well.
5,What they say is true!,"I was really skeptical about trying another eco-friendly dishwashing product because I was disappointed with 7th generation's product, but after reading all the good reviews on here, I decided to give it a try. I do not regret my purchase. This stuff took things off some pans that no other dishwashing liquids could. You use much less product than 7th generation and more than most concentrated dishwashing liquids (for obvious reasons), but it does its job and it does it well. Give it a try!"
4,wooooow um,This DVD is painful!funny but painful... u have to reallly love joan or bette something awful to buy thisor just be very determined to have cause this dvd is just WOW! but like I said theres a few good parts
1,I suspect this is the ultimate rip off.,"Shaun Considine's fun book, BETTE & JOAN, details at great length (often too great a length) the ""rivalry"" between these 2 great screen legends. That work is surely the source for this two hour(!??!) documentary which surely has no new light to shed on a relationship that was very little fire but a whole lot of smoke...that only seems to fill the room more as time passes and the legend grows.I cannot fathom what could comprise two solid hours of information about this flimsy premise other than an abundance of clips and some soundbites from ""experts."" No wonder it's being offered at such a low price.I'll reserve judgement until such time as I see or read otherwise, but I plan to steer clear. If I need to sink my teeth into some tired old gossip, I'll dust the book off the shelves. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy the great Crawford & Davis DVD collections of their movies...which is how they'd best like to be remembered, anyway."
1,I should have listened,"I should have believed the other reviewers. Being a die hard fan of both actresses, I thought, ""how could this be bad"". This was 50 minutes of absolutely NOTHING. It was cheaply put together. I learned nothing from it. What a waste of money! If I could have given it zero stars I would have."
1,BETTE and JOAN deserve so much better!,"This DVD has poor picture and sound quality. The information is not always correct nor does the narrator give any sources for the quotes attributed to Bette and Joan.The worst part of this DVD is the narrator. He is obviously an amateur and narrates the story as if he is reading from the yellow pages.He makes idiotic statement like ""Olivia replaced Joan in Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte and that really uped the old lady quotient.""This is one of the dumbest, but there are plenty more where that came from.I suggest you save your money and your time and skip this puerile DVD.This DVD is so stupid you will actually feel your IQ going down as you watch it."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This DVD documentary got me excited when I first became aware of its impending release. Priced at under $10 I wasn't turned off by the unfavorable reviews because I figured it's worth the gamble. Well, it wasn't. The first ten minutes told me I had wasted my money. Had I not been such a fan of Crawford I would have probably turned it off before the end. I stuck it out but it's certainly a bitter disappointment."
1,Garbage,"Do NOT waste your money on this ridiculous piece of junk. There is so much misinformation and an obvious Bette slant: Bette was the ""actress"" and had a great career after Baby Jane and Joan ""merely"" a star who ended her career in bad films. Davis ended her career in a film far worse than TROG so I find this rather amusing.At any rate, this is mostly a poor rehash of facts found elsewhere in Joan Crawford:The Ultimate Movie Star and Bette Davis: A Basically Benevolant Volcano."
1,Watch the A&E documentary about Joan instead & skip this one,"As others have already stated, this DVD is not worth getting. It was very poorly produced on an apparent very low budget because the sound and pictures all looked sub-standard. But the content was just as inferior because there was more than just a couple inaccuracies. And why did they have to put an older picture of Joan and a younger picture of Bette Davis on the cover? I would have loved to see a picture of Miss Crawford from the 30's because this was when she was at her most photogenic, but Joan was always very beautiful, at any age! If you're interested in watching a quality documentary about Joan, I recommend the A&E biography which is often shown on Bio Classics."
1,Cheap plastic!!!,"When I first bought this gun I thought I was getting a good deal. But I soon learned that you get what you pay for. Three days after purchasing this gun it broke. Its just not a good gun at all. If you plan to purchase this gun, BE WARNED! It will break. Iv'e tried to fix it and i almost done! But trust me, it's not worth $30. And my warranty didn't cover it! If you do purchase this gun than your in for one heck of a headeach! I hope you like puzzles!"
2,Shallow spinning,"2 1/2This is probably the best disc the swirling, effects-heavy group has released, but that does not say much since I really find the group overrated. Production is always a chore, rarely complimenting sonic architecture the greatest moments strive towards, and instead highlighting what weak melodies and techniques are really going on. You just cannot escape a cloying garage-level experimentation with these guys. The key has always been drowning that stuff out with enough noise that somehow it becomes meditative, a hard to find compromise FSA rarely strike in my opinion. One wonders how much better off they would have been completely abandoning any delusions of traditional vocal based rock and concentrated on ambiance alone."
4,Hey this worked really good till my grand nephew's dog bit it clean in half,Awe... it might have deserved 5 stars had it had a chance to prove itself. But I did buy another that I still have but it is still in it's original packaging as a back up for my other cords. Until i break it out and use it hard for 6 months I have nothing else to say here.
2,Failed after a year of light use,It's worth is to bite the bullet and get a Mogami cable. But search eBay. There is a guy that makes them for about half price of Guitar Center.
4,Colors Everywhere,"What color is a pumkin? What foods are brown? Konigsburg answers these questions by exploring the world of colors through foods and living things. The exagerated pictures add to the fun of reading her book, and Konigsburg's choice of word placement gives a sense of suspense. She surprises the reader with every turn of the page. Konigsburg also expreses her humor through her choice of what objects will represent each color. Who would think of eggplants for the color purple or freckles for the color brown? Konigsburg also lends a moral to young readers when she says ""Some things can be any great color, and some have no great color at all. Like hugs and kisses and songs. And they are some of the best things of all.""Konigsburg's childlike observations of the world will help keep young children excited as adult read the book as read-a-loud and will encourage children to look around their world searching for colors."
5,Great pick,"My wife loved it. These are great watches, I would go for the automatic if I had to do it again. It's a pain having to go in for service for a new battery. I have the same men's model in automatic for 3 years now and no issues, it is a little fast, but to be expected. The quartz is more acurate, but also costly to replace the battery and seal water proof. I didn't think she would ware it as much and that's the reason I went with quartz for her, but now it's her choice for a watch almost exclusively, unless she is really dressing up."
5,good gift for my wife,I got this for my wife as gift to surprise her. She likes it a wear this over her Mov.
1,"race movies Hi De Ho the Devils Daughter Beware/Reet, petit, and Luis Jordan","I love Cabs way of directing and shaking his hair. Im too young to really know of him, but whenever I did see him this is what he was doing. that is what I was looking for not this . maybe someone from back in the day might be a fan of this movie just not me none of the four were my fav."
3,decent,"This product is ok. The magic circle is good and well put together, but the mat is pretty small. I was expecting something like a regular yoga rollout mat, but this mat was about 1-2 feet too short. I'm 6'2 and so needless to say, I was pretty disappointed about the size of the mat. The delivery was quick though, and overall I'm pretty pleased; that's why I gave it the 3 stars."
2,Big Downer :(,"Given the pricepoint, there was too much filler, i.e. sample contractural agreements and the sort.I was really expecting more detail and revelation of 'trade secrets', given its speciality book classification. This will probably be the first book I return. The only upside are the photos, but you can find stamped concrete photos anywhere--- certainly for less than fifty bucks. Most of the text is a redundant overview of concrete basics!"
2,light on details,"There is no question the author/producer knows what he is doing But, was long on basic construction procedure, which I already knew but very short on the exact procedure of adding color, stains etc. Wish he had taken more time to help element the pitfalls of the stamping process, how to align, more on matching colors etc.But overall it did help me to begin my own learning process.Sincerely,Larry Thorpe"
1,thanks god i didn't waste my money,"i was planning to buy haris books for longtime but i didn't because i was always busy. fortunately one of my colleagues bought the whole collection in a sale. i asked my friend to lend me the ""guide to stamped concrete"" and i read it. although i feel disappointed because I've wasted my time reading it wishing to find some value. but i am still glad that i didn't waste my money too. i will read the other books and i will update you later, hopefully i don't go through the same experience!!!"
3,Nice kit but will need a different pump/filter system,"Purchased this kit a while back and finally had it installed. If you have your hole dug out properly, installing the liner and filter would be quite simple. The pump/filter system was very easy to install too. However, if you have plants, be ready to clean out the darn filter once day. It's probably the worst pump system I've ever owned. I really can't see how the pump can be rated as 1250 GPH. If the pump filter is slight dirty, it would pull no data thus the external filter is very much useless.I will probably have to throw away this whole pump/filter set and go back to my submersible filter."
2,You can do better,I've had this kit installed for a year now. The pump never worked out of the box. The cheap plastic filter cap on the pump will always shift and jam the impeller causing the pump to fail. The filter is pretty much worthless (the reviews on this filter says it all). I'm happy with the look and all but could have done much better buying the liners and quality pump and filter system separately.I would not recommend this kit!
4,Read it and feel better!,"A book well-worth reading! ""Feed your Need"" is a very readable book which opened my eyes to how food choices affect the physical body. Applying just a few of the suggestions has made me feel more energetic and healthy. For anyone wanting to understand WHY you should eat or not eat certain foods this book is invaluable."
4,Clear and logical....and easy recommendations to follow.,"Among all the overblown self help books that are out there, I found this book refreshingly down to earth and balanced in it's message. Life can be very good with just a few small changes in the way we live and eat. Read this book and enjoy a better life. It helped me !MnM"
5,Beautiful...,"I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves music. The music is excellent, Marya has a beautiful sound which is all her own and the musicians shine. It is also very well recorded and is one of the best sounding jazz records I have heard in quite a while."
1,Save your Lire,"This book was an absolute waste of time and , ... also a waste of money. My husband bought it for me as a gift. This is the only reason I felt compelled to read the book. The author drones painfully on and on about her husband's packing problems and bike fetishes. There is very little useful or interesting information about Italy in this book. For those of you who have been to Italy there is NO reason to read this book. For those of you planning a trip for the first time , please read something else. This book is not well written, offers the reader nothing and is a total waste of time!!!"
2,Silly excuse for a book,"This slim volume should have been a nice little personal website and I suppose makes a nice gift for the right person but is not much of a book. There is something embarassingly amateurish about the book that nearly raises it to the level of camp. The author has never lived in Italy, does not speak the language, doesn't seem to know any Italians personally, and does not appear to have ever experienced the most obvious way to ""satisfy your love affair with Italy"" (or if she has, doesn't want her husband to know about it).Italophiles who don't really know the country might enjoy this book. It is not exactly harmful, and in its own naive way rather charming and entertaining. It is fun for example, to see which ""Italian"" movies immediately come to mind but don't make her list (""Miracle in Milan"" and ""The Comfort of Strangers"" are two that I don't see her mention)."
3,"Could be better, but may be helpful for some","Briefly, the book was on the disappointing side. The authors have spent a long time infusing what they think is humor into every chapter which got old after a bit. While much of what is written seems to be common sense there are some helpful insights scattered throughout the book, but you have to read through a lot of fluff. The few scraps of meat in the text certainly cause you to pause and evaluate your own work relationships, behavior, as well as your coworkers, to include your boss. If money is tight, then go ahead and buy it. If you are looking for something helpful, buy something other then this book. Three stars was generous."
4,Not as expected..... ?,"Please understand that Out of Myself & Second Life Syndrome are welcome favorites of mine for the last year or so. The 3 new songs on this EP are slower, but with the same lovable suave intensity unique to Riverside (superb - therefore the 4 stars). The Live songs are a bit rough... but hey these guys have been together, how long?3 Years ?This is definitly a wonderfull musical expierence, from basic rock, building in emotional intensity to a grauling metal burst, all this without loosing their sound. . . love it!Don't start with this one! Get Out of Myself (1st One) or Second Life Syndrome the sequel to the previous first CD.Both are excellent, highly recommended if you like...same comparison with other bands type of sound b sI will leave up to you to spend 12 bucks or notI have no regrets. Peace"
2,Voice in my head,"I bought this CD (EP) with great anticipation. After listening to it the only voice in my head asked, ""why did they release this""? After ""Out of myself"" and ""Second life syndrome"", I thought this combination of wonderful musicians was near perfect and the guitaring sublime. The few new tracks on this EP are slow and ultra-short and the live tracks are crude and rushed. By now, Riverside fans expect long, complex and hypnotising songs and they will be very disappointed in this CD. Riverside, please give us another Second life."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"34 FRICKIN MINUTES OF GOOD MUSIC AND THATS ALL THEY CAN COME UP WITH FOR A 3RD CD , AND HALF OF IT IS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED . I REALLY WAS LOOKING FOWARD TO THIS CD AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE LENGTH . ALTHOUGH THE MUSIC IS GOOD . MUSIC IS 5 STARS BUT OVER ALL 3 STARS . PUT SOMETHING OUT WE CAN JAM TO FOR A WHILE........"
2,spend a little more...,"I bought this cd because I enjoyed the pianist's playing of the two chopin concertos, available on the Naxo's label. However, this recording in no way matches the artistry of lugansky, pollini, ashkenazy, or perahia. If someone is looking for a budget recording, berezovsky's is worth every penny and much more. The sound on Szekely's recording is marred by a murkiness, but it does not hide the pianist's wrong notes, which one would overlook in a live recording given the difficulty of the chopin etudes, and his hestiation to inhabit these works. Instead, these interpretations seem, like the recording, distant and unfocused. Save some money and spend a little more on the pollini, lugansky, perahia, or berezovsky."
2,"Great photos, but not for the inexperienced.","The photos are lovely. However, the book assumes that the reader has experience in the kitchen. Some very basic techniques are merely mentioned, not thoroughly explained. For example, the chocolate roulade recipe instructs you to ""whisk the egg whites into a meringue."" (Whisk? Does anyone still whisk egg whites?) Look up meringue and you are instructed to ""beat egg whites until stiff but not dry."" It's assumed that you already know all about beating egg whites, folding techniques, etc. Yet, the book provides photos and detailed explanations for such trivial tasks as how to stone peaches and how to shell nuts.The recipes are interesting but the gaps in the instructions will be frustrating to the average cook."
1,Great pictures but horribly written...,"This is my second Cordon Bleu book and I am extremely disappointed in it. My other Cordon Bleu book, Le Cordon Bleu at Home is a fine book.The recipes in here do not follow the traditional method of listing all the ingredients first then the technique. You have to read the whole recipe more than once to wade through the convoluted directions and variations for a recipe. The pictures are beautiful but they only do so much;the organization of the text leaves much to be desired. I've had a lot of experience in cooking and baking and found this book very difficult to use. I will probably return it. If you are looking for a dessert book I'm sure you could find a lot better ones."
1,revised rating and additional comments,"I knew the photos in this book looked familiar - they're from the DK Press cookbooks (especially Ultimate Cakes).The Cordon Bleu editors spliced in photos and sections of the DK Press technique explanations. That's why the recipe instructions are disjointed and some techniques are never explained - the section in the DK cookbook(s) they're taken from has not been included in the Cordon Bleu book. It's a cheaper production method, but it's unfair to an unsuspecting buyer. I'm very disappointed with the Cordon Bleu.If you really want to learn about desserts, pastries and cakes, buy one of the DK Press books - to make sure you get ALL the pictures - and refer to Rose Levy Beranbaum, Nick Malgieri, Maida Heatter, Julia Child, et al for instructions."
3,Pretty but could use some improvements.,"It definitely is a pretty cookbook and provides a lot of neat ideas. However, I had to look up at least several techniques to be able to reproduce a recipe. You would assume that they would explain all of the technique that they mention. I also don't think that all the recipes are correct. I had to modify several of them, and the brandy snaps batter solidified into a brick, ruining the container it as in. And I wish they gave more dessert ideas. Seems like some are just missing.While it might be worth it at discounted price, I would not pay a full price on it."
4,So far so good,"PROS: manufacture claimed to have lifetime warranty, made in Singapore (instead of China).CONS: usually memory stick is more expensive than other format (SD, compact flash, etc)."
3,A Bit Static,"Jah put out a few albums one after the other that basically sounded like this - he and a drummer (Jaki Liebezeit or someone playing in a Jaki-like style) playing slow tribal beats behind horns and bagpipes, circling around slowly for long periods of time. It has some charm but seems to me a bit of a rut compared to what Wobble and some of his friends are capable of."
3,More of the same,Somehow this particular Disc sounds like a weak reppetition of Anugama's Shamanic Dream vol. 1. I was dissapointed. It sounds more of the same.
5,"Shamanic Dream, Vol. 2","I love this music, it is the best, should also try Vol 1, it is also the best."
5,Spiritual Retreat,"I recently attended a spiritual retreat. Shamanic Dream, Vol. 2 was played throughout the whole retreat at different functions such as: Intro. to Yoga, Tarot reading, and sitting meditation. After the successful retreat, the haunting tunes gently played over and over in my head. I had to purchase. Not sorry. An excellent choice for a spirtiual retreat, at home or away."
5,Fantastic,I love this CD. I bought it after hearing it in my yoga class. The drum rythum sends my mind to a different place. I can feel my whole body relax when I listen to the music. A fantastic CD for meditation and right before bed to relax the body and release the mind.
3,The Giant Track,"I picked up this cd for a number of reasons. 1) I am a huge Neutral Milk Hotel/Jeff Mangum fan. 2) I know that while recording his opus ""Aeroplane Over The Sea"", Jeff listened to a lot of the kind of music heard on this disc. 3) Even if it was terrible I had to have it, because I'm a fanboy.All that said, the music itself is interesting. It is recorded live, at what sounds like a festival. The quality is good, but the structures and sounds you will be hearing are quite different from any western music you've heard.So for adventurous fans of Hungarian music or for Neutral Milk Hotel fans who need to understand the roots of their favorite band, this is a worthwhile purchase.ONE WARNING: It says ""Edited by Jeff Mangum"" but I'm not sure what ""editing"" actually took place. The CD is one large and long track that fills the entire cd. Don't expect to have separated songs. It doesn't hurt the album that much, but it's awkward, and potential buyers deserve to know."
2,Not a classic,"Only memorable for its ordinariness. Yet again our hero has been accused of a crime he didn't committ. Fine for a one-hour drama set on Earth, but out in space anything can happen. Anything. Wish the writers had explored their imaginations a little more for this one."
2,"""Murder She Wrote"" In Outer Space","That's probably the best way to sum this one up. It's very well done for a murder mystery, but Battlestar Galactica had much more potential story premises than this. There's nothing bad about it, but nothing great either."
2,Oh boy...,"The less said about this one, the better. How many times have we seen one of the main characters accused of a crime he didn't commit? They're out in space, they can meet anything, anyone, that the writers can come up with....and they do a story like this."
2,This is incorrectly listed.,"This item features an image of Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop, not Meryl Strife from Trigun. Thought someone should know."
2,This book needed a patient editor,"This book is obviously flawed because editors push 'hot' authors to complete books quickly and take advantage of the possibly-temporary fame.This book doesn't come close to the first 2 in quality of writing, plot interest, exploration of philosophy, ...It needs about 100 pages cut out and a lot of re-writing. It needs a decent ending, one that measures up to the promise of the first 2 in the series.Very disappointing."
2,A necessary read but a sleeper,"I have very much enjoyed reading Kage Bakers' Company books. However, I must say... this one's a real sleeper. It's a necessary read because it has valuable information (very little...) and insight for the next book, ""The Graveyard Game"", but I snored thru it.Especially the chapter on Babylon. I was tempted several times to skip the whole thing, but kept thinking I would miss information I would need later on. NOT!However, don't let this book turn you off to reading the rest of the series. ""The Graveyard Game"" is fantastic. I couldn't put it down. I hope the author is busy writing the next ( and hopefully answering *all* my questions!) book."
2,Mendoza asleep,Mendoza is normally pretty sharp but in this yawn Kage Baker is too busy setting up the background some larger tome to follow that she doesn't bother to include a plot in this one.
4,Great read,"I actually liked this book better then sky coyote. It is rare that i become emotionally involved with the characters in a book, but by the end of the book, I really, really thought mendoza was a world class bonehead. It takes great craftsmanship to involve your readers viscerally in your novels. Baker has suceeded and I hope she continues. I love her stuff. Can't wait to read the graveyard game."
3,Slow Beginning,"I have to say that I do not agree with the other reviewers. I found the book difficult to get into because the story line did not seem to start until page 220. I kept waiting for the big event to happen that they eluded to throughout. They seemed to infer that she has a power to travel through time without help from the Company, but did not explain this further. I found the long descriptions of the silent movies boring and not at all useful to the story line. I will say that by page 220, the book did get good and I could not put it down. It seemed to be over too fast and felt angry that she hadn't put more time into that part of the book. I loved the first two of this triology and would definitely continue to read Kage Baker's Company books. I could see where the book was heading and it sounds like a great next story. She also was able to give insight into the Company's history, which can also lead to an interesting story line."
1,lost in space,"The author as well as the character are totally lost. Certainly the idea of Dr. Zeus and his immortals is interesting. For goodness sake's this is the third I have bought and read. But it is like a bad joke that goes on and on. I keep hoping for some interesting point or switch but we suffer AIMLESSLY with Menoza who is suffering for 300 years for 5/6th the book until we meet her new love, and then he is dead 40 pages later and she and the reader is endlessly punished. Get a new idea!"
2,"Like Mendoza, you'll be begging to die halfway through","Mendoza in Hollywood is a great disappointment. It lacks the wit of In the Garden of Iden. Of course, the 19th-century American west is never my favorite time period, and there's way too much traditional Anglo American history (a la Frederick Jackson Turner).Imarte (the anthropologist gathering information as a frontier whore) is the best part of the book.Far too much time is spent in film descriptions, in cyborg film buffs mapping ""homes of the stars"" onto 1864 California, and in slapping together conspiracy theories from the Company's data.What is brilliant about In the Garden of Iden is only a third-sequel re-hashing in Mendoza in Hollywood.But don't take my word for it!"
2,Disappointing,"Hard to believe this is by the same author who wrote the first two. She wastes the whole first half of this book in being ""cute"" -- a forced kind of whimsy that goes nowhere. The really interesting developments that appear in midpoint are never followed up on (maybe in the next book?) The whole recapping of the plot of ""Intolerance"" seems barely germane to the plot of the book. Big chunks of the book are taken up by philosophizing thinly disguised as dialogue. The romantic part of the story was one step away from being a gothic bodice-ripper. I still think the whole concept of the Company is terrific. I know Baker can write with keen humor and sharp insight (""Sky Coyote""). Let's hope her inspiration returns for the next books in the series."
4,Very good series,"I read the Company books for the first time in the early 00s, and remember really liking them. Even better the second time around."
3,Wandering Aimlessly,"In this installment of the Company novels, Mendoza is stationed in the hills of Hollywood, California, during the early 1860's. Her task, as always, is to collect rare and/or valuable plant species that would not survive the centuries without the Company's help.Beyond Mendoza's task to collect plant species for the Company, the plot in this installment was pretty thin. The characters just did not have much of a purpose...there was no cohesive plot holding everything together. And, while we do end up with a bit more information about the Company at the end than we had at the beginning...there was nothing to move things along to reach the climax of the story.Overall, Mendoza's jaunt in Hollywood has been the biggest disappointment of the three Company books up to this point. I look forward to things hopefully picking up with the next installment."
1,Never worked from day 1,"I wanted to get my son a child friendly cd player he could tote around for the summer. I took it out of the box, put in batteries and it barely plays a cd. The microphone doesn't seem to have any sound at all, but it can't even play a cd. I had to jiggle the volume knob for a long time before a song came through, but it goes in and out, crackling and fading. This is completely worthless."
5,Cina,"It looks very efficient and it is great because it has mp3 has well as watching videos,so you can do a lot and it will keep you ""playing"" with it for a while. Its also one of those things where you dont throw it in the bin, because the whole point is for listening and watching so u cant call it a toy, bit like a cross between mp3 and videos 'mp4'"
4,Juice Box,"An inexpensive entry level for a personal media player. It's portable and fun. The design is robust, handy size with 3 colours to choose from. With the Juice Box, you can listen to music, watch video and view photos too. The software is simple to use. I only got this 7 days ago and I am loving it! By Suliebeanie."
1,Taking back my other review,"If you have looked at the review titled ""Good as far as i've seen it""(i wrote it), you would think that the Juice Box is good. Well, I think i made a huge mistake, because i bought the Juice Box and the graphics were all blurry and the sound was bad, because i couldnt hear the people on it talking. I know i said that it was really good and all, but the display ones at stores dont show anything at all, such as a little preview of the upcoming products. Please dont buy the Juice Box, unless you really want proof, because you'll end up returning it."
1,The suckiest piece of junk ever,i bought this piece of junk and it breaks so easily and it is way to over priced
1,There is NO content -- not buying,this is not for me. it has no shows. videonow has so many discs. videonow shows are a better price. My friends have videonow and they love it.
1,THIS SUCKS!,"THIS THING SUCKS ANYBODY WHO BOUGHT ONE WOULD AGREE WITH ME UNLESS THERE 4 OR 5. I MEAN WHO REALLY WANTS TO WALK AROUND WITH A BIG SQUARE THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A 3 YEAR OLD TOY! I'D RATHER HAVE AN IPOD. NOT GO AROUND AND SAY "" HEY! LOOK AT ME I'M CARRYIN' A JUUUUICE BOX! HUHHUH!"" YA I'D LIKE SOME SUSPENDERS TO GO WITH THAT! IF YOUR MY AGE (THE 5TH GRADE) OR ABOVE DON'T BUY THIS KIDS WILL LUAGH! I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM EMBARRESMENT!"
2,Yeah right...........,"Heres whats wrong abd terrible about this peice of junk:1. The video quality is HORLIBLE!2. To actualy make it an so called ""MP3 Player"", you have to spend (...) extra! (...)This thing is a MAJOR ripoff!"
3,it's ok,"This toy never really became as big as the videonow, but if you want some of your favorite Cartoonnetwork shows on the road, why not. The lower level quality picture leaves a lot to be desired. It's a bargian at only $35, but I bought mine when it was still $60. The mp3 is a huge advantage over the videonow, and has a decent sound opportunnity with headphones. You don't get rich quality picture because of the low storage percentage on the chip, they sould of had a cd format. The flip cover protects the screen and also doubles as a stand. The buttons are easily reachable and it is easy to operate. Just wished the picture quality was a tiny bit closer to the videonow's. But I bought it and i liked it."
1,Yawn!,"When I got this, I was very dissapointed. The screen is terrible. I couldn't even see live-action completely. The only thing I like about this is that when you put in fast-forward, the people sound like chipmunks. DO NOT BUT THIS CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,THE JUICEBOX GOT SPILLED~SAVE YOUR MONEY.,"THIS TOY IS NOT IMPRESSIVE. MY 10 YEAR OLD STEP-DAUGHTER PLAYED WITH IT BRIEFLY, AND ON TO SOMETHING ELSE. THEY NEED MORE JUICEWARE IMMEDIATELY. THERE IS HARDLY ANYTHING GOOD FOR SALE. WE HAVE NOT HOOKED IT TO THE COMPUTER YET, MAYBE THEN, IT WILL BE A DO INSTEAD OF A DUD."
1,IT STINKS!!!!!!,"Don't buy this product, you will only just end up returning it, it is really band and the picture on the screen is terrible!!"
3,A BIG MISTAKE,"i saw it in Wal-Mart before Christmas and i thought HOW COOL.(there were a lot of suff for it then) then i got it for Christmas and was like Awsome. i aslo got 2 meadia chips for it. i watched them and got bord. so i asked my mom if we could go to wal-mart to get more. we went there and look all over and there were none. then i came home and looked on the computer and could not find any good ones.it has an okay qulaty screen. i think i will buy Video Now, it has way more choices. SO DO NOT BUY IT OR AT LEAST THINK IT OVER FIRST. GO WITH VIDEO NOW!!!"
1,O my my my,"O man can this thing get any worse, i am 14 years old and i bought this thinking it would be a cool thing to have. u can watch tv shows and everything...Then i got it the picture graphics is HORRIBLE. And theres not a good choice of videos to play on it. If u want a portable tv. Buy one dont waste ur money on this cheap product. [...]"
1,nothing in this,"terrible quality. you cannot see the picture when you try to watch it. the sounds is sooo bad. how do they call this an mp3 player? also, you need to buy alot more equipment to make it work as an mp3 player...the commercial on TV makes the product looks much better than it is...(...)"
1,Are you kidding me?,"cool idea, lousy product. i bought for my kid to watch in the car he could barely see the image on their poor quality screen. i then read about it and they don't have sponge bob and the other shows he loves. (...) the package and commercial are misleading.who ever thought of this.... you're fired!"
2,Bad toy,"its really only good 4 tv shows, cause the ""mp3 player"" on it only holds 2 songs!the screen isnt big enuf, but atleast it isnt 2 small. but it still shows sum shows. overall, its kinduv a bad toy cause its really only good 4 tv shows."
3,So-So,"This is kinda cool, my cousin and i got one and we like it, but the picture isn't the best, the sound speaker is where you are supposed to hold it, the kit is way to expensive, and is seperate. OH AND I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT ASHLEE SIMPSON LIKES THE JUICE BOXlike the commaercial shows, SHE HAS TONS OF MONEY SHE CAN GET A BETTER $1000+ portable dvd player, an ipod, i have an ipod and it is way better than this, but i just use it to watch shows when i'm bored.But yu gio oh the most loser show made, and that show is about the only show jucie box cartriges are.all in all, it's pretty cool."
5,Good as far as i've seen it,"I went to Toysrus and saw one of these, i know the some people say that the picture is bad and the sound is horrible and blah blah blah......but when i saw it, i pushed the 'on' button and it was so awsome. the sound was great (it was loud, too!) and the picture was cool too. after seeing that, i cant believe that people say that it's bad, because its not, but its not good either....ITS AWSOME!!!!! I'm most likely to buy this soon"
3,Juice Box,"I know the screen is a little small and there aren't a lot of videos to choose from, but thats because it just came out almost a week ago. it is going to have to grow a selection just like VideoNow did in the begining! So Don't go complaining about not enough videos or not good enough graphics. VideoNow was probably the same way!"
5,AWESOME,THIS IS SO COOL...DONT KNOW WHAT MAXMASA31 WAS THINKIG. WELL GOT TO GO PLAY WITH MY JUICEBOX
5,"wow, what a great album!","I have listened to Marc Ford for years, as a member of the crowes, always loved his playing, there are a lot of great live shows floating around out there, this album, it is not the crowes, in fact it is much better in my opinion than a lot of the crowes material. I read reviews saying that this album downplayed his guitar playing,and that really is a crock, there is some excellent guitar throughout, guitar playing is not all solos! Great slide work, which is to be expected from one of the best slide players on the planet. More important than any of that, is that this is really a solid album when it comes to the songs, they are all great! enjoy!"
5,Gran album,"Sincero y honesto disco el de Marc Ford, sin duda la gran pérdida de los Black Crowes. Influencias de Gram Parsons, Stones, Neil Young, The Band,...Una maravilla de principio a fin."
4,A SUMPTUOUS REPAST,"This album is full of delicacies that will make your mouth water for the next one. Enjoy the swimming in this sea of sweet sound and harmonic convergence and divergence. And the artwork of the cover and liner add to the decidedly interesting vibe. If you like the THIS MORTAL COIL project idea, that's how this started. I might mention, there's really not a lot of piano per se -- there are many instruments. But the magic is here! After only one listen I'm giving it four stars, maybe it should be five. This is a collection of their EPs and singles, 1996-2000..."
5,Very good tale of a small company succeeding,"This book was hard to put down. I enjoyed the book to the very end. I was shocked about all the things that went on in Fox Software. A small software company from Ohio, was able to change the software industry."
5,Right on the Money,"FoxTales is an excellent read. Once I got started, I simply could not put it down. As an employee that actually worked in the offices of Fox Software, I always felt that Fox Software was a company that succeeded more in spite of its uppermost management, rather than because of it. At times Fox was an exciting and awesome place to work and at others, it was humiliating and torturous. Kerry does a great job of presenting the experience as a whole and of wrapping up a series of somewhat loosely related events into a very entertaining story. It's nice to see someone tell the outside world what it was like at Fox Software.If nothing else, Dr. Fulton had an excellent eye for talented developers and he certainly did manage to assemble an incredible team. It's great to see how Keary and others were eventually rewarded by Microsoft for their efforts and perseverance."
5,Great read,I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. Kerry does a great job of taking the reader behind the scenes at Fox.
5,They are great!,"I saw Unamerican a few days ago at The Who concert and they were great, not as good as The Who though.I'm gonna pick up this cd, so you should."
5,The Old And The New,"I (47) took My daughter (16) to see the Who at the Nissan Pavillion.What a treat Unamerican turned out to be, she insisted on buying their disc at the show, I did and we love it, now I have to order my own. Needless the say the Who where fantastic as always, I got to introduce her to the Who and me to Unamerican, Buy this Disc, its a treat for the ears."
3,Nice album from a new band,"A solid effort from a worthwhile new band. I think 5 stars gets thrown around a bit too lightly in the reviews. This is a good album worth purchasing, it has a couple of excellent songs (Mary's Son, Wicked, and Closer You Get) and a few duds (This is the end). The band puts forth a very good performance, maybe a little overproduced at times. I bet they are very good live. This album highlights their promise and it will be interesting to watch out for them in the future. The band that they remind me of is Toad the Wet Sprocket.Worth purchasing - absolutely. 5 stars - I'm afraid not."
2,Be forewarned!,"Nowhere on this CD does it inform the buyer that it is copy protected and will not even load on a computer. So if that is your preferred listening mode, you're out of luck. It sounds great on my CD player and I echo Dennis' review. So the two stars reflect my frustration and the lack of consumer information, not my appreciation of the music."
5,"A wonderful, thought-provoking film","Afterschool is an intriguing and incredibly moving film. Like most great films, it is not always easy to watch -- it consistently demands that the viewer pay attention to and think about the plot, characters, and themes unfolding onscreen, both as the story unfolds and well after the credits have finished rolling. Many reviewers have mentioned that the film seems to be a commentary on technology and its effects on today's youth; yet, in spite of the fact that modern technology and the boarding school environment are both central aspects of the film, the fundamental struggles, confusions, and adolescent issues at the core of Afterschool are universal, and not constrained either to the 21st century or to elite private schools. This is a fascinating film: difficult, thought-provoking, and immensely rewarding."
4,Very readable ...,"Short biographies on the top hockey players and top teams in the NHL are complemented by paragraphs on hockey's various leagues, cups, international events, rules and terms. There are numerous black & white photos throughout. A very readable book and it's small enough (9.25in x 7.5 in) to be portable and sit on the bedside table."
1,Not a Happy Customer,"Folks,How do you expect me to review this item - I never received it!! This occurred despite the fact that you allow a storefront on your web site to tell customers that they have inventory in stock while all the time they are just an intermediary who direct delivers from the manufacturer for profit (i.e., there was no inventory to make the claim of 'in stock""); and, despite the fact that you allow customers to be billed as soon as an order is placed rather then making vendors reserve billing until a shipment is confirmed."
5,Ricardo Beverly Hills Mariposa Rolling business Tote,Very nice rolling tote. Well made and very roomy. Nice material inside and out. I like this bag alot and searched numerous bags before purchasing. I am very happy with my purchase. They also included a mail in for a free luggage tag with your initial on it. A nice touch to an already nice bag.
3,"not a Veritas, but works ok","This is not a Veritas or TiteMark quality tool, but for $10 it is well worth it. Sharpen the wheel cutter, and clean the locking wheel/bolt and it will work quite well. You'll also need to shim/washer the cutter, to allow it to rotate freely. Can't ask to much for $10, but after you fettle it some, it works. It you want a quality wheel marker, buy the Veritas or Titemark, if you're cheap like me, buy this one and fix it up."
1,Replaced with a Titemark,"The rod and brass fence are acceptable, but the cutter is junk. It can't rotate, so it kind of drags along, plus if you hold it the wrong way the cutter actually unscrews and can fall off. I ended up just paying the extra for the titemark and removed the worthless cutter and use it as a depth stop now. At $10 buck its a waste of money. If they fixed the cutter so it could rotate freely and was flush to the end, it would be a good value. One thing to watch is that the fence doesn't lock down tight, so it can loose up and slide when the cutter is following the grain of the wood.-James"
1,Poor quality,"The screw easily strips out since it's made of brass; as such, the wheel can't be tightened enough to keep it from slipping."
3,Shop Fox D2822 Wheel Marking Gauge,"I think it is a good buy for the money. The only problem with it is the blade. It came dull (I think the edge was actually rolled over from the manufacturing process). The blade was denting the wood rather than cutting it. Since the blade is conical on one side I couldn't sharpen it myself. I gave it to a friend and he sharpened it on his lathe. He gave me an electrical standoff, like those used in circuit boards, that I could attach the blade to and chuck up in my drill so that I may sharpen it myself in the future. Also I stripped either the little screw that came with it to hold on the blade or the first couple of threads in the mating hole. This was easily remedied with a new, longer screw. In summary, a good value tool, but not ready to go out of the box."
5,Best Marking gauge ever,"The Shop fox D2822 wheel marking gauge is so simple to set up and lays down a clean crisp linefor marking chamfers, cut lines, mortis and tenons and the like. The D2822 is the best"
1,Not worth one dollar,I would have to agree with all of the negative reviews. This gauge just doesn't perform in its as purchased state. The marking wheel doesn't turn and when it does it moves the set screw so that the measurement is off. It requires too much effort and rechecking to be sure that it is accurate. Mine is going on the shelf to collect dust. Spend your money on something else.
4,good for the money,Does what it is supposed to do fairly well. The screw holding the cutter wheel comes lose and needs a shot of lock-tight but otherwise does OK
1,girlology- PLEASE,PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS BOOK!!!! IT IS NOT FOR ANYONE YOUNGER THAN 16 YEARS OLD IN MY OPINION! WAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION FOR EVEN TEENAGERS ON A COUPLE OF THINGS.
1,too explicit,"I bought this book for my daughter because she has alot of questions sometimes young girls don't feel comfortable asking their mom, grandma, or even friends their own ages. This book is too mature for girls that age. I heard my daughter reading the book and could not believe that this was the book I had bought for her. She then had this look upon her face that told me I had alot of answering to do. The book just put more questions in her head."
4,"Great starter disc, grows with your ability","If you've at least stepped foot on a disc golf course and know that you want to continue playing, this is a very good driver to start your collection. It's great for starting out because you can get reasonable shots without being technically perfect, and you will really dig this disc as you start getting better.It's not going to fly as far as a Discraft Crush or Innova's Wraith, but it's not going to frustrate you for not having a perfect release (though disc golf still ain't easy!).I actually believe this disc is overstable, rather than the described ""understable"". Meaning that it will tend to turn away from direction you throw as it fades. If you don't what this means, read up on an actual disc golf site.Good complimentary disc for this is the Innova Spider, which is a ""multi-purpose"" disc. If you're just starting out, you can use the Archangel for the long shots and the Spider for basically everything else."
4,RL Rep,The Reebok Baltimore Ravens Ray Lewis Replica Jersey was well received by the recipient! As soon as it was unwrapped at Christmas it was put on! It was a great price too!
2,occasionally loses the data connection,"I bought two of these cables in 2008-Oct, and both exhibited the same problem: Occasionally (maybe once in 10-30 minutes) the data connection is lost and the picture turns to snow. Sometimes it recovers within a fraction of a second, sometimes it never recovers until I switch the TV to a different input and back. This is between a Samsung PN63A650 TV and a Sony BDP-S350 Blu-ray player. The problem also happens between the TV and a TiVo HD XL. It usually happens in 1080p@60Hz mode, rarely (maybe never) in 1080p@24Hz mode.I later bought a cable from monoprice.com (10ft, 28AWG, with ferrite cores) and it works fine in all modes."
5,Good cables,"Good cheap cables, work as described. Allowed me to move my computer w/o changing the position of my monitor. Would recommend to others."
2,Poor quality cable,"This is a $10 cable, so don't expect a clear picture. On my DLP, the picture quality is bad enough that I won't use the cable."
3,"Handy, but not in-depth enough","The Inner Planes is a good general guide for DMs looking for information on the Inner Planes, but it isn't very thorough. They should have made it more of a rule-book for DMs (such as the books in the box sets for the outer planes), but instead tried to write a 'creative' guide similar to the book 'The Fiends: Faces of Evil.' This technique doesn't work as well here. The so-called guest writers are not able to keep in character well because they have to keep mentioning game rules, and the game rules suffer because you have to read too much text to fish them out. On the other hand, if you don't have the old (and out-of-print) Manual of the Planes, this book is a valuable reference because it is the only to find specifics on the inner planes. It mentions a couple of sites for each plane, but doesn't go into much detail. Overall, the book could be better but is still a good Planescape reference."
3,"Material lacks planar mood, but intriguing phys conditions","Monte Cook's ""The Inner Planes"" is all that it claims to be, that is, it contains detailed survival tips and descriptions of the planar environments, rules for getting about, and info. on interesting beings and sites. However, it seems that at least half the material is recycled from ""Manual of the Planes,"" with the faction sites (i.e. Doomguard citadels) being a notable exception. All in all, I didn't care for many of the artists' (King and Rex) works within, found the book lacking the planar edge found in earlier books, but very complete in describing the environs of the Inner Planes. If you are imaginative enough to come up with some quick rules on your own, I do not reccommend this book. If you want a complete planar library or are a strict by-the-booker, then I highly reccommend ""The Inner Planes."""
2,Not much of anything new....,"I was disapointed by this book. I was looking for new info on sociology and politics but found only a few general ideas and not much anything else... The planes' description introduce more detail as to the physical aspects but the writing style is mostly narative and ""unpersonal-like"". They try to make use of the same writing format as in Faces of Evil but fail.... The art is good but scarce. All in all, I find this book seems empty :( Probably the worst PS product to date. Unless you can't figure out anything about the Inner Planes, I suggest you let this one pass by."
4,Easter Tie,Bright colors with an old design look. I have never seen an Easter tie. Great prices from the seller. Fast service. I will definitly purchase more ties.
3,Interesting,"In this book, celebrated Puerto Rican writer Rosario Ferré confronts English and Spanish in a Duel. This book of poetry is very interesting, on the left pages we have the poems in English and on the right we have the poem in Spanish. The comparison is very interesting and it is fun to decipher which was the original language of the poem. It seems they were all written in Spanish first, but I'm not sure.The translations into English are excellent and sometimes (rarely) the poem is better in English than in Spanish.Some poems are really good, and others are well, bad amd boring.I recommend this book because the comparison and contrast of the two languages is extremely interesting."
1,No Reality Here,This book has no reality to it. Everything is taken out of context to fit into today. Sentences were taken out of the verse and used as examples when the whole idea is the entire verse. If we believe as this author has written then the world is doomed and a woman will do it by 2010. No where in the original verses does it state that a woman with ruin the world.
2,Nostradamus 2003-2025,"I am writing to express my dismay and concern over Nostradamus's iconoclastic mind games. Here's a quick review: If it were up to Nostradamus, schoolchildren would be taught reading, 'riting, and racism. Nostradamus's precepts represent a backward step of hundreds of years, a backward step into a chasm with no bottom save the endless darkness of death. I once told Nostradamus that even Nostradamus must concede that learning the truth can be a painful experience, especially for it. How did it respond to that? It proceeded to curse me off using a number of colorful expletives not befitting this letter, which serves only to show that I have some advice for Nostradamus. It should keep its mouth shut until it stops being such an odious riffraff and starts being at least one of informative, agreeable, creative, or entertaining. Okay, have you had enough of this letter? Good. Let's end it by reiterating that quislingism is sustained by rigid ideological categories."
3,"Good music for a soundtrack, don't buy for Nick Cave content","Not a bad soundtrack to listen to. It's definately ""movie-worthy"" and well composed. However, I bought the soundtrack with Nick Cave in mind. What the album turned out to be were melodies that he helped create, minus vocals. Good tunes, just no voices.Kind of curious to know how the movie was."
4,"Not a Cave disc, but great still.",I bought this disc because I'm a fan of the various artists. And was expecting a blend of all their talents. It is...but not in the way most expect. This is a soundtrack not anything like their other works. So if you are willing to expand your listening tastes to some instrumental orchestrations then this disc is great. Otherwise you might be disappointed.
2,Disappointed,"I have been looking for the aftershave lotion that my husband used up and thought I had finally found it...it said it was ""lotion"", right? Not, it is just like the cologne. A great smell but not the product I expected to receive. Nicely wrapped or I might have sent it back when I received it. Didn't know it was the wrong item until Christmas morning....."
2,Bad azz look but oversized brake pad.,I brought this exact item from autozone. These pads really compliment the interior with the titanium or silver trimming but the dang brake pad is oversized especially for someone like me with a big foot (size 13)LOL. Get it at your own risk.
1,Terrible!!!,"Completely under any thing reasonable usable!The break pedal is alright, very functional and very easy to install.But the other is simple terrible! The way it is assembled makes installation very very difficult, there was no way I could use it in my Honda Civic the way it came in the box and even after two days trying it out, after I finally make it stay in place, I discover the thing stays almost in a 90 angle with the floor making it impossible to drive.Besides, there are sharp edges all around it.I guess this is what you can buy for less than $10!"
5,best green tea!,"my husband and i have been looking for a green tea we both could like - this is it! very nice smooth flavor, and lots of health benefits. will definitely order again!"
5,The Mysterious of D.W.'s Precious Blankie,"... is why it's never seen in any of the other books. That being said, this is another delightful D.W. story.D.W. badly wants her favorite Blankie, but can't find it. It's gone off-the-map and D.W.'s not going to be able to get to sleep without it. Arthur kindly agrees to help her out by taking her to some places where she might have left it. It's not at any of them, though. Later on, however, D.W. makes a surprising discovery about what happened. Will it change her feelings for Blankie?I really like the illustrations in this book. I enjoy the pink stripes on D.W.'s outfit in the books (that aren't on the TV show) and this book takes it a step further on the cover by adding a blue speckle pattern to her pink jumpsuit. The story is warm and cute and perfect for any D.W. or Arthur fan."
3,Toddlers love DW,"DW has captured the heart of my toddler through this book. While DW's parents are oddly detached and not exactly compassionate, DW's Lost Blankie speaks worlds to little ones. We make our way through the stress of a lost love object, to have it returned at the end having been washed. We aren't sure why it is so addictive to read and reread this book in our house, but it is a keeper for sure!"
5,PRODUCT REVIEW,GREAT PH TESTER AND ADJUSTING KIT. JUST TAKES A DROP OF PH UP OR DOWN TO CHANGE PH LEVEL IN A GALLON OF WATER.
4,PH Control kit,Great product easy to use no problems have fun with it you can't go wrong using this product. I would buy it again.
5,Perfect kit,I use this for adjusting the ph in a large reservoir before watering my plants. The seller got it to me faster than expected. Te kit is easy to use and includes everything you need. The included ph tester was more than adequate. I would definitely recommend this to anyone starting out growing indoors in soil or hydroponics.
2,Dont know about these,"not a very accurate PH testing kit because the test vial they give you is very small and if your water is under the ph that you want, if you add just one drop of the PH UP solution it will jump about 5 points in PH. The color system is inaccurate as well because it's hard to tell the difference between 2-3 PH. 6, 7, 8 and 9 PH all look relatively the same and its hard to dial down to a certain PH. i would send these back if i could and just buy a digital PH reading pen"
5,Quick and easy!,"Yeap, quick and easy to ph the water for your plants and the plants love ph'ed water as you will see the difference.General Hydroponics GH1514 pH Control Kit"
2,Missing items,Perfectly sealed package missing the ph testing tube and ph testing solution. I have my own meter but still not happy that I didnt receive everything that is shown here
5,Tap the hidden resources of your sleeping mind!,Loved this audio book.... With the ability to target your own dreams you're able to use the creative resources of your brain. Delaney's modern dream interpretation system helps you understand what your dreaming brain is trying to tell you. I found it facsinating and it has opened up a whole new world of creative thinking!
4,Left Me Breathless,"I saw these guys in the Gilman and I was just blown away. Psychedelic Punk! What could be better? Almost a brand new kind of music. The songs hit on themes of sexuality, politics, environmentalism, and mind exploration. I was a little disappointed in the vocal delivery though, which is sometimes a little too mechanical-sounding, as opposed to the raw stuff I heard live. The guitar work is so awesome you feel like you're moving."
3,review from ...girlpunk....,"Where do they find these people? Well Alternative Tentacles found Iowaska in the UK pumping out fast politically charged psychedelic punk rock. Iowaska is a very unique British band whose lyrics are very political which you can hear in songs like ""Change"" and ""Don't Go"". They combine trippy psychedelic guitar effects with fast heavy chords to create their own distinctive blend of music. At the end of the thirteen tracks there is a spoken word by lead singer Sam Skraeling, in which she speaks about a very painful religious female circumcision. The CD insert is full of beautiful and strange drawings and paintings that were done by hand by Sam Skraeling. Each picture corresponds to the hand written lyrics and fits with the song. Iowaska's music is quite different from the music I usually listen to so I found it to be odd. But if you're looking for something different or a change in what you usually listen to check them out!"
5,the man's a wizard!,"This is a solo acoustic guitar album. Smith's playing displays virtuosity and his writing is creative, accessible, and unique all at once. Its like listening to music from a parallel reality: it has much in common with what you've heard, but its different. This is true artistry, and really one of my favorite albums."
5,The title says it all!,"Doug Smith has got to be the finest acoustic guitarist there is today. No one has a greater sense of melody, rhythm, and bass line all combined at the highest level of intricacy. Cannot recommend it highly enough!"
4,Tempur-Pedic Travel Pillow,"This is an excellent pillow. It's firm and comfortable. I not only travel with it, but I also use it at home when I'm watching TV. It's so comfortable I have fallen asleep many times when I use it while watching TV. I would have given it 5 stars, but the one complaint I have is that it's a little too smug around my neck. It took a little time getting used to something that tight around my neck. Otherwise it's exactly what I was looking for."
4,Are you SURE this isn't a New Pornographers album?,"Except for the lovely ballad ""Come Crash"", A.C. Newman's solo album could easily pass for a New Pornographers album. John Collins and Dave Carswell are on board, and Sarah Wheeler fills the Neko Case role on backup vocals. The guitars are not turned up to their maximum legal crunchiness here, and there's less keyboard, but otherwise the sound is very similar. Some of the rhythms have been done before--for example, ""On the Table"" sounds a lot like ""The Electric Version"". But overall, the songs are still catchier than they have any right to be. My favorites are ""Miracle Drug"", ""Drink to Me, Babe, Then"", ""Come Crash"", and ""The Town Halo"". Yours may be different, because there isn't a bad cut on the album.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
4,Good solo debut,"Carl Newman, the frontman for The New Pornographers, follows up the huge success of ""Electric Version"" and ""Mass Romantic"" with his debut solo album ""The Slow Wonder."" Newman shows that he is not only a talented rock artist, but has great singer/songwriter talent too. All the hooks and pop melodies of his group work are here, but toned down and more personal. The result is a fantastic album that proves to be one of the year's best solo efforts."
4,Fantastic power pop,"I can't stop playing (or humming) ""On The Table"" and ""Miracle Drug"". Highly recommended."
3,Try looking up Colin Newman instead...,"...you might find his early recordings more interesting. As for this record, what's the point? Ask yourself how does this differ from the other indie guitar bands littered about the world? I believe it is very well done and all, but it's fate will probably be sealed like so many other semi-decent pop records (into the pit of obscurity..). Each to his own, I suppose."
4,Slow Wonder a smart number,"I recieved A.C. Newmans' via post two weeks ago today and 14 days later it's still in the same place I put it: In my discman. I can't bring myself to replace it. After hearing it only once, I noticed that the catchy melodies were lodged in my brain and still have me hooked. The lyrics are sharp and emotionally loaded with a bite that defies the Beatle-esque and high spirited music.All that aside, what impressed me the most was the arrangement. Using these timeless riffs that would, by all rock logic, belong to a guitar, Newman asigns these to the most unusual instruments such as cello, piano, whistling, or a recorder (a RECORDER for petes sake!) Lending the albums overall sound the sort of skewed view seen only through the eyes of genius."
5,Excellent,"I heard ""Miracle Drug"" on an alt. station and couldn't get it out of my head. After a quick websearch, I ran right out and bought this CD. And I am delighted with it.I bought a New Pornographers CD a couple months ago, but apparently didn't read the liner notes, as I did not put two and two together until reading the reviews on this site. Duh. No wonder I dig this CD.Run, don't walk to get a copy."
5,keeps spark plugs uncorroded in a marine environment,I bought these after my spare plugs were so corroded I could not use them when I was in Baja. No more ruined trips.
5,handy item for scooterist tool kit,"Love these little containers that fit spark plugs. If you are a vintage scooterist, these are a necessity for keeping your spares safe and clean while you're on the road."
4,fingerprints,The book is well written and easy to follow. It is not for the faint of heart as there is a lot of information on a not so interesting topic.
2,Depends on the purpose,"As an instructor of Imprint Analysis, I have mixed emotions about this book. If you are in the profession it is a MUST have. However, if you are thinking about using this in an introductory course, I would advise against it. My students have a very difficult time with his writing style. Also, as a professional you can see past the arrogance as well as understand it. As a student, it comes across to many as snobbish and dry. I am having a very hard time teaching from the book.I agree with the previous reviewer as well that he needs to leave his agenda out of the book and let the reader come to that conclusion based off the facts.I stress, for a professional or advanced student this is a book filled with knowledge that will assist you for years to come. As a teacher, NOT a good bet for introductory level students."
2,"Ummm, not what I was expecting",I thought this book was a second book to follow WOOF! which was a great informative book on human puppy roleplay. Turns out this book is a collection of short stories of roleplay scenes mostly boy/boy leather scenes. The stories were good if thats your interest if not it gets repetitive and doesn't hold your interest for long.
4,working in a group environment,"The workbook is strongly task oriented, as you should expect. Each chapter does have a concise description of its theme, like intervention techniques or conflict resolution. But you are expected to use the underlying textbook for a fuller exposition. Instead, this workbook has extensive exercises for the chapters. Many are group exercises, which are meant to also let you garner experience in contributing to and running such groups.Indeed a significant point of the entire workbook is the latter. Above the specifics of a given exercise's tasks, take the opportunity to work in a group environment. Good practical experience."
3,Primitive (Smog),Compared to his most recent release Supper and even by Julius Ceasar's standards this is a very primitive sounding album. Sewn to the Sky was originally recorded at home and it features a bunch of crude and chaotic songs. I must say after a few listens this album really grew on me. The album is definitely succesful in carrying a very isolated feeling which has a very familiar feeling to all of Smog's work but does so in a creepier way. It's an interesting one to turn to just to see how this guy got his start but definitely not one that's going to be in your player all the time.
3,"Very distorted and disturbing, but underneath that are good, well-crafted songs","I agree with the previous reviewer. When I first listened to this album it creeped me out and kind of made my stomach turn. It has such an eerie sound to it. But after listening to it several times, it starts to sound like actual songs instead of just lo-fi noise. It sounds a lot like Lou Barlow's Sentridoh/Sebadoh stuff, and also like the Cure and Jesus & Mary Chain just for the constant noise playing in the background. It is a hard listen and can be grating on the ears at times, but once you get it you may appreciate it. If you like Smog in the first place you'll probably like this album too. I got mine off of Itunes and at the price they are offering it for on here I'm glad I did."
3,Set up is the worst,I can't actually rate the system when it's up and running because I can't get mine to go past the setup part. I've entered many many codes and none seem to work with my dvd player which is only 2 years old. It seems many have this problem so I know it's not just me.
1,Doesn't work with my dvd,"I was excited to find this product on sale because I love Leap Frog products and so does my 9 mo. old. However, I tried for hours to set this up with my DVD player. I followed all the instructions exactly and I even called customer service and they gave me other set up codes to try. I still cannot get this product to work. I'm very disappointed because we can watch the video but cannot interact with it, which is the whole point."
3,Marginal toy.,WE got this as a gift and I would not recommend buying it. Set up was not that big of a deal and we got it up and running on 2 TVs in about 5-10 minutes each. The problem is with the DVDs. They are not interesting. The delays are also longer than they need to be. We bought 3 DVDs. She has played each about 3-4 times and has completely lost interest in this toy. Buy a Leapster instead.
3,More pros than cons,"Bottom line the set up sucks! I had this thing initally set up in about 5 minutes, however after changing DVD players (my previous unit went out on me) set up just would not take even after a frustrating 25 minute call to customer service. I am disappointed because now I have this useless unit and some unopened additional software for this thing. Overall this is a good learning tool for a 10-24 month old child, IF you can get it functional."
3,Great if you have a DVD player that works with it,"I read all the reviews about players not being compatible. We used it in our XBOX with ease. But then one of the games I bought would not play in the XBOX and I thought, ""no big deal, I can put it in the combo player. The XBOX was easy to set up."" Boy was I wrong. I have to take a break after trying 25 different codes so far. As far as why the one game won't read, who knows. Usually the XBOX will play videos that the combo player won't so this is unusual."
1,Can not get past setup on 2 dvd players,"I couldn't tell you how it works because I've yet to get it to setup. I don't like the other reviewer's comment about how dumb we are. I have a Bose 321 system which I just found out from Leapfrog is not compatible and I have an Apex DVD/TV combo I've tried all the generic codes from the website, the ones listed in the book, and even the ones customer service emailed me and they still won't work. I have yet to try my Hitachi in my room b/c I've already spent all day trying to get this thing to work. My son has several Leapfrog toys and he enjoys them all except for the activity gym and I'm very disappointed that he can't enjoy this."
1,Don't Buy It!!!,"This machine has wasted around three hours of my life. It wouldn't work with our Panasonic DVD player, our XBOX 360 or even a brand new RCA DVD player we just bought from Target. It sounds like fun, but after 3 times it not working with our DVD players...my 2 year old heart is broken, don't tell your toddler that they are going to have so much fun with this, only to find out it doesn't work with most DVD players. A horrible gift for her 2nd Birthday!"
1,Item wouldn't work on 2 dvd players,"This item would not work on either of my 2 different dvd players. It would not set up by the quick setup method or the manuel method. It never read the signal on my dvd player. If anyone got this item to work on their dvd, please let me know what kind of dvd player you have."
1,Not so great...,"We bought this for my 17 month old for Christmas. We were thoroughly unimpressed. We didn't have much trouble setting it up, but our son doesn't like it at all. Waiting around for the narrator to say ""press a button"" and then having a significant delay between pushing the button and the ""game"" (I use that term lightly...) continue just isn't fun. He doesn't understand that he's supposed to wait and he doesn't understand that once he does get to push the button it's actually making something happen. We played the sample games and the games on the First Steps disc. There was nothing that he was interested in at all.When we bought this system, we thought it would be much more interactive and much more educational. It's really just a DVD that needs a button pushed every once in a while to continue. Completely not worth the money in my opinion. We'll stick to our Baby Einstein DVDs for now (he loves them!) and leave the ""video systems"" until he's older."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this as a gift for my 23 month old boy, with the only toddler dvd they have. BORING!!!!!!!! This game is so dumb after watching a really boring cartoon, if your child is still paying attention to the T.V they just ask you to press a button, once you press the button there is a big delay before the video continues, so it isn't even obvious to the child that he has interacted with the T.V. My son sits and watches elmos world and baby einstein, so it isn't like he doesn't have the attention span, this game is horrible. I set it up in 5 minutes though with playstation 2. That was more fun then the game. LOL"
1,"Four DVD Players, Zero Help from Leap Frog, ONE unhappy family!!!!","After trying a total of 52 codes on 4 different DVD players in our house, the customer service department at Leap Frog disclosed to us that they do not have all the codes for all DVD players yet. It was explained to us that the push for Christmas Delivery forced Leap Frog to release the product before they determined complete compatability with the current DVD player market. So since we threw the boxes and everything else away, it was recommended to us to buy another DVD player!"
1,incompatible with three DVD players,"I didn't have a dvd player when I received it as a gift. I keep buying different dvd players and returning the dvd players since they are incompatible. The setup codes that correspond with each dvd brand, I can't get to work. The two dozen universal codes that customer service gave me don't work either.I'm very irritated. I want to return it."
2,"After 2 hours, gave up on linking to DVD player","I just saw this toy, and bought it for my 20-month-old because she loves the computer but hasn't figured out how to use a mouse yet. This toy seemed perfect. However, the ""easy"" setup proclaimed on the box turned out to be 2 hours worth of entering 50+ codes into the machine trying to get it to recognize our 4-year-old SONY DVD player. If you go to the product site, most of the FAQs address setup, so it seems to be a common problem. Maybe a newer DVD player would be easier, but we finally just gave up and returned it with the 2 games we had bought."
4,What's wrong with you people?,"How hard is it to follow directions??? The set up took less than a few minutes, on 2 DVD players!!!My daughter and I have been playing with it all day; she even learned to recognize letters, just in a matter of minutes.There is not a 3 minute delay, as one reviewer wrote...the delay is max 4 or 5 seconds..not long enough for the child to lose interest.And hey people, its ONLY 40 bucks..shoot, i spill more than that in alcohol a week, will worth the money!!"
3,Not for the Young,"My Little Brother recieved this for Christmas last year and my mother and I were excited as to see whether he would like it (he had just turned 2) or if he could even figure it out. We were even excited to try it out on my son who was 9 months old (they are only 17 months appart). Neither one of us were very impressed with it. Ya My little brother wanted to hit the buttons but you can only hit the buttons at certain times where it ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING, he did not understand the joystick so he had to use it in baby mode. My son tried it too and showed no interest in it at all. So pretty much the only person who enjoyed this product was my little sister who was 3 at the time because she actually UNDERSTOOD IT. I think this is pretty much a worthless toy and I was so excited because it was from leap start..."
2,Does Not Work with XBOX 360 DVD,"Warning - if you use XBOX 360 as your DVD Player, this system will not work."
4,Review,"I am generally not a fan of science fiction but I saw this at the library and tried it. Surprisingly entertaining.Funny in parts, but well done throughout it went too quick.Not a classic but definitely worth the time."
1,Junk!,"I purchased after my previous plastic one with a somewhat different design, but no brand name became misthreaded after 3 or 4 years of use. How long did this last? About 10 days! The little black shutoff shown in the picture fell off. Kaput! I wouldn't buy this again."
5,Fine Effort from a Young Band,"Catalepsy was a short-lived local band from Indiana in the late 90s (this album is NOT related to the death-core band, Catalepsy, of more recent vintage). Their live shows of the time consisted of a wide range of covers, as well as these and a few other originals. This is their only album, released in 2000, but it is a fine effort. It is all original tunes and shows a variety of influences from the 60s and 70s, most noticeably Pink Floyd, but also some Abbey Road-era Beatles. ""Here to Greet the End"" is a stand-out track.The band had considerable talent and consisted of:Robert Wade - vocals, keys, rhythm guitarPatrick King - vocals, lead guitars, keysMatt Johns - percussionBlaine Hillan - bass, vocalsPete Schwartz - keysThe song list:1. Prologue2. A Little Too Much for the Piper...3. Gentle Rain4. So Far Away5. Alicorn for All6. New Standard7. Here to Greet the End8. March of the NephillimI bought this when it first came out and it holds up well today."
4,Good Product,I needed this book for a management class I took. The book was in decient shape and was a whole lot cheaper then the local collage book store price.
2,"Canceled Order, Worked out.","Although I canceled this order only a few minutes after I ordered the book (after speaking with an Amazon Rep),the e-mail was not promptly received and the book was sent out. I did return the book to the seller who refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping."
1,Bad Costumer Care,"Sell Sell Sell. That's what they really want only!!! ... I needed my book faster. I sent an email right before ordered it, saying that I wanted something faster, or I needed to cancel. Of course it was my fault of not seeing that they were from Europe, it was going to take 2 weeks but, there was no understanding AT ALL. Never buying with them anymore!!!"
4,VERY Informative Book of Mummies for Adolescents,"I read this book because I asked my daughter to read it as part of her homeschooling history curriculum, and I wanted us to be ""on the same page"" as far as her learning was going. (It is also quite a bit longer than other books in her curriculum and I didn't want her thinking I was giving her work I wouldn't be willing to do myself.)Although this book is between a 5th-7th grade level, it is PACKED with information on where mummies are found, how they are formed, how scientists learn from them, and what happens to mummies when scientists have finished with them. Even I learned a lot from this book. I think anyone who is interested in mummies, anthropology, or Egyptology but still doesn't know much about it, should pick up this book as a good basic starting point. There is also a good sized bibliography as well as a chapter on which museums usually display the mummies covered in this book are located."
1,Beware--Don't purchase the Ignition Pad,"We purchased the dance pad for our children for Christmas and by the middle of January, the back pad was not working. We tried to return to the store we purchased and they wouldn't take the return because it had been past 30 days. We received the same response from Red Octane. I went with the more expensive pad because of the description the company gave it, but I would have been better off purchasing a pad for 20.00 and then if it broke, I would purchase another and still not be at what I paid for the ignition pad. I am very disppointed in the customer service from the store I purchased the pad from and Red Octane."
1,Wtf,"I thought I would be the only one whose RedOctane pad effed up but I guess not. My left button hardly ever responds after only a couple days of play; noticed the problem on the FIRST day I got it.The foam platform and raised steps idea is exactly what DDRers need, but this doesn't function correctly at all. They almost got the right idea but really messed up. Don't get it."
1,...,"So, this was working fine for a few months, until the buttons stopped working. After a while, none of the arrow keys would work, no matter how we stepped on them. It was a waste of 100 dollars. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Had mine for 2 years now...,"I've been reading about a lot of problems with these, but I've had mine 2 years now, and it responds rather well still, and I'm an avid player.I do have some problems with it responding when I stand in the middle, but very few problems otherwise. This is even with having my little sisters and cousins stomping away on it. The layer inside is slightly torn, but it doesn't seem to cause any real problems.Once this pad wears out, I will gladly buy another one.By the way... People complain that the pads break, but if you played in the arcade, you'd know that they need to replace parts in the machines once or twice a year. Unfortunantly, with these, the parts are not really replacable, so they give you a 20% discount and you can buy a new one.Have fun and dance on!"
1,SAME EXACT PROBLEM AS OTHER REVIEWER!!!,"Someone bought me TWO ignitions for my birthday last April. I happily used one until August...and then the back step stopped working. When I unzipped the unit and looked inside, I discovered the pad had RIPPED underneath! I wrote the company and got the SAME exact response as the other reviewer--only 60 day guarantee, but 20% discount if I wanted another one. So I said to ""no thanks. Even only 80 bux for only 5 months of use just isn't worth it."" So, I've been using my second pad since August...here it is December, FIVE months later, and the top step stopped working. Unzipped the pad, looked inside, and the pad is ripped.I'm going back to the Konami pads that came with my DDR games and never looking back. That was 200 dollars down the drain for the person kind enough to gift them to me..."
1,Poor quality control on the Ignition 3.0,"We're about to return our third RedOctane Ignition 3.0 to Best Buy. I'm glad that I didn't order this unit directly from RedOctane. The 3.0 version either malfunctions or its button pads (which raise the arrows slightly) start slipping to the center of the pad. RedOctane has really messed-up on the 3.0. If you must buy it, then get it at a retailer that has a solid return policy and test the unit extensively. If it shows any flaws within the return period, take it back immediately."
1,Buy if and only if you like playing the lottery.,"For most people, this pad breaks after a week or two.For me, it was broken after less than one day.For 1/100 people, it works like a charm and is the best pad they've ever owned.So don't believe anything you hear about ""this pad is amazing!"", unless you like playing the lottery, which is what buying this pad is."
3,The DDR Ignition Dance Pad,"Wow! I can have the arcade at my house! That's what I was thinking when I bought this dance pad. It was my first. So I played on it for about 3 weeks.The bottom arrow stopped responding.. I tried everything. I exchanged it for the same model hoping it wouldn't maulfunction again. After 2 weeks this one stopped working, too!Now, I tried exchanging this one for a different version of the pad. No luck. GameStop did not allow me to exchange it because, ""We do not accept any game that has touched 'human sweat'"" and ""The item contains sweat of a human person so we cannot exchange it"" words of the manager.BOTTOM LINE: DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE DANCE PAD! $100 was what I paid. They saw that it malfunctions so they dropped it to about $65."
1,Stuck buttons,"I've own 2 RedOctane 3.0 dance pads for a little over half a year. They were great while they lasted but recently some buttons started to get stuck. At first only 1 pad would malfunction and the down arrow would sometimes not respond while other times automatically repeat itself. A week later, the 2nd pad started to have the same problem, but with the right arrow.I'm a little pissed considering I paid almost $100 for each of these pads, when I could've gotten a generic foam pad for a quarter of the price. Even if those pads aren't as reliable, I could have 4 for each RedOctane pad and I'm pretty sure those would last at least 1.5 months each.All in all, I'm rather dissatisfied with the product. I've heard horror stories of people trying to contact support, plus they only have a 60 day warranty limit."
4,De lo absurdo a lo congruente,"Toreros muertos de destapa sin inhibiciones a nada, no hay parametros para hacer una descripcion de su musica y no tanto por la mezcla de ritmos si no por su variedad que se puede encontrar en cada album de ellos, puedes oir una cancion de rock y le seguira un twist... o una opera, no sabes con que te sorprenderan. y si quieres letras ironicas, debes comprar cualquier cd de ellos."
1,I hate not the product but how it was packaged for shipping,The product is what I expected cannot fault Bachman for what the shipper does not do. In collecting model railroad products the preservation of the case is as important as the product in the case. I did not expect was to receive a damaged case beyond use. Do not purchase from this seller unless you are looking for the product to be damaged.
4,Great Black and White Photographer Mapplethorpe,"Im a photography student, and one of our assingments was to bring a photographers book to class every week and discuss our favorite photo. I picked Robert Mapplethorpe because of his extreme latitude of subjects. He doesnt stick to one type of subject, one page will be a self portrait, the next a flower, and the next a poloroid of a boat. If you like photography even just a little, buy this book."
5,Heroines for all times.,"This book containes stories that helped me live through all the tough times in my childhood-in my teens,and even now.The good will succeed.The wicked will fail.The good are gentle and forgiving;the Charles Perrault Cinderella,forgiving her sisters,is one example.The real little mermaid,not the Disney clown.The loving,suffering girl who will do anything for the one she loves,and who gets her reward;an eternal life.Eight girls who have lived,strong and brave,some since the seventeenth century,some even longer.Every part of the story illustrated by many of the best artists who ever lived.Nothing dumbed down,because the stories exists outside of time or place.Won't you let your children(of any age,from toddler to teen)get to know them?It's a new century.We need true heroines!"
5,A music to go deeper and deeper...,"The kind of music that changes you deeply.A very stange and sick travel into the deeper part of your mind. many others albums from Daedalus & R. Festa should be interesting for all the melancholic people.Hear, for example, ""Saturn & polyphony"" ."
3,Did not work,"Amazon experience was great, ordered it one day received it the next. Problem was that it did not work (shut off after 2 seconds). I had to get it serviced."
1,Should have bought locally - Dead after 5 months,"Panasonic is one of those brands that has never failed me. However, this microwave simply quit working after 5 months of use. Looks like I have to deal with the hassles of warranty work. And likely work with a local repair shop, so maybe buying locally would have been a better move ? We will see..."
1,No Panasonic AGAIN!!!!,"Well, I bought this microwave 3 and a half years ago (mind you, I'd had my old microwave for 10 years, and it was still working great when we decided to remodel and do an over the range microwave)! Used it this AM, it was working - got home, and it was COMPLETELY dead! Hard to believe. It was great.... While it worked! Unfortunately, Consumer Reviews didn't know about the longevity issue with this microwave. My 300 bucks went down the drain after 3 years....Back to the drawing board!"
2,"Sweet timbre, but generally weak technique leads to flaws","The artist has a sweet sound to his voice, and the range of a real alto countertenor, however, his weak technique leads to flaws that greatly reduce the expressive ability of his voice. This collection of lute songs is an above average recording in terms of the general body of work by countertenor artists, but doesn't stand against the vast body of recordings available by solid artists with wonderful vocalism and expressive interpretations.It is worth listening to for the good alto register, and because this artist has great potential, but not as a quality piece that can be enjoyed over and over again."
1,No good for audio books,"The resume function does not work for audio books. These are often 6-10 hours all on one track (secure WMA file from Netlibrary). Without the resume function, playback always starts from the beginning."
1,"Lousy, Broke after 2 weeks and NO REFUND.",This player is fragile and unreliable. Do not buy it. Mine barely functioned for two weeks and then crashed completely. Absolutely useless. The seller will not refund my money. Don't get suckered by this player!
3,another reader,"This book might have some interest for the look it provides into the minds of fund managers, but as advice for individual investors it's virtually useless. Almost every manager interviewed details how he makes use of information that is never available to individuals (Am I going to do my own evaluation of the Hilton hotel chain? I don't think so.)."
4,ONE OF THE MOST INSIGHTFUL STOCKPICKING BOOKS TO DATE!!!,Frailey gives individual investors a glimpse into some of the investment world's greatest minds. His interviews reveal how the best money managers find their ideas and then act upon them. Seperate sections cover value and growth with clear advice on how to develop your own style. A must read for any serious investor
3,No beeper and display only.,"I ordered it with amazon LLC. And it arrived quick.But after opening the box and reading the manual, I realize the beeper is optional.I need a beeper to save the possible mistake back up.I return it and no problem on return, amazon pay the postage. The last, I never install it yet, so my rating is sort of dummy. Thanks.Updates. I got the 4 sensor model. They are the same except two more sensors. The display has a built in beeper (the buzzer is extra), so I was wrong. The installation instruction is too simple. For example, you need to drill 4 holes to the bumper. But actually, to run the wires from bumper, you better uninstall the bumper from the car. The other challenge is to find the reverse light wire and tie to it. It is not a plug and play. Amazing there is a Youtube which is excellent. I eventually gave up and picked up the phones: $120 to $250. OK, not bad. $120 for 3 hours, deal. It is working well."
4,northbury papers,"Northbury Papers - English professor at the fictional Enfield (the real life area inspiration was probably the Happy Valley in Amherst) Karen Pelletier has decided to write Serena Northbury, an early feminist writer,biography. When she interviews a descendant of Serena's, she becomes involved in a murder mystery, when the woman dies unexpectedly, leaving Karen her papers in order so that a center for women's studies may be founded, she also puts Karen as a suspect. Meanwhile, tensions are heating up over a student who is harassing another one of Karen's students. When she gives the boy a bad paper grade, his father, a college trustee threatens to sue. With Detective Piotrowski's help, she turns to solving the mystery. The author is clearly having fun poking fun at the pomposities of college life."
5,Good follow-on to Quieter Than Sleep,"Definitely need to read Quieter Than Sleep to draw the full benefit of this ""second in the series."" Enjoyed the character development as much as the central story."
3,The Northbury Papers,"The Northbury Papers is a good old fashioned mystery. It will not cause your heart to beat faster, but is quite a nice read. I especially enjoyed how she let you in on the not so nice agendas of all the characters. Life is complicated, and she weaves this aspect nicely into her who-dun-it."
3,it takes the fun out of child development,"The paperback version is nice because it's cheaper... but after reading it, I think I would prefer the hard cover. Paperback books of a small size are fine, but this one is too large to work as a paperback. I have a hard time reading it because if I put it on my lap it sort of flops over and I can't see the whole page.As to the content... I found it to be a little insulting. A lot of the points the text makes are sort of trite and obvious. It says things like ""children are our future."" This is true, but it doesn't seem like something that needs to be said in a college level textbook.It looks pretty, with nice pictures and quotes in the margins, but there just doesn't seem to be much substance. I think a topic as interesting as child development should have a more interesting book."
5,Get Snapshots before they get you!,"If your understanding of the world evolves around what you learn from various TV shows and magazines, you should probably steer away from Snapshots since you'd never understand that you're exactly the person Snapshots makes us laugh at. However, if you like a tad bit of sarcasm and irony, as well as being able to see the humor in any situation, you will find out that Snapshots takes both the best and worst out of everything. Highly recommended for everyone who put good and intelligent humor before anything else, including political correctness, the recent death of your pet rabbit and failed election for the city council."
4,Not bad,I rate this kit as a 4 because working in a body shop alot of cars therse days dont have rad caps and for this unit to work it has to mantain a vaccuum..if you dont have the right fitting you cant evac the rad or fill it back up
5,"Same exact one, with more fittings, as the Porsche tool","As far as evacuating air from a coolant system, and refilling it, this is the greatest invention since the funnel. I LOVE this tool, for its fast and easy to use combination of super high quality construction, and myriad of fittings for any car I've come across. Saves SO much time, mess, aggravation, assures no air, while checking for leaks before you add the coolant, and has a carrying case to boot! Must have a comressor with a storage tank. Only thing lacking from instructions is to remind you to clean the whole thing after use with clean water and let dry. A home mechanic ""must have"", especially for water cooled Porsche owners."
4,Feedback on 550000 airlifift purge tool,"Good and practical product to purge air out of the cooling system for rear mounted engines i.e Ford GT,and Ferrari."
5,Please don't buy it: Save the rest for me!,"I simply love my new Dilama Dorado slim organizer. To and from the office and in and out of airplanes it's the true ""It"" item that makes organization feel stylish and sophisticated."
3,"Good product, good price","IPod accessories were as described, good pricing for a pack of 5, with an armband for working out."
1,Pure crap,"This is the worst product I have ever seen for $29.95 plus shipping. The arm band is falling apart from the minute you pull it out of the box and the ipod nano cases are crap, they are small flimsy plastic casings that look as though they should cost $.20 not $30. I am so disappointed with this product and can't beleive it's available for purchase, DO NOT BUY!!!! What I did buy after purchasing this was the DLO Action Jacket for my ipod nano from Bestbuy. It is so much better and the material is stronger, though still not worth the price it is the best arm band for your ipod on the market."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!,This item is a complete waste of money. The plastic is very generic looking and the strap looks like its been made by hand.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
4,Great product for the price,"I have had these cases for 4 months, and I am pretty happy with them. The silicone is fairly high quality, though one of my cases tore at the top from wearing it with the lanyard too much. Also, there are some small open places at the back that do not protect the nano from scratches. I put a small piece of plastic wrap on the back of the ipod to protect it before i put the cases on.My main problem with this product is that the colors ARE NOT as advertised. They are much duller.Still, considering the price, they are a good choice."
3,Not Bad for the Price,For $8.95 it's a good place to start with a new Nano. The colors are not as bright as advertised but seem ok anyway. You get what you pay for.
4,Therapy in Adults who are CD,"I purchased this book to add to my knowledege about CD treatment with CD GLBT individuals. It was very helpful, but not much evidenced based practice regarding different populations"
1,"What a Bad ""Book""!","As a long-time customer of amazon, I was tremendously let-down by this ""book."" It was uninformative and useless. There are only two or three sentences on each page!!! If you put all the sentences together you would only get five or six pgs max on an 8 1/2"" x 11"" piece of paper. I felt cheated and robbed by this ""book"" that contained mostly info that everyone knows. Next time, I have to be more careful when buying books online."
2,A dry set of academic papers.,"This set of essays attempts to analyze such questions as ""what are the conditions, including economic, cultural, and even personal situations and proclivities, that prompt the founding of new organizations"", and ""what are the real and important outcomes of entrepreneurial activity?""The book might be of interest to you if you seek this kind of sociological or organization theory analysis, but of little practical use to someone starting or managing a company."
4,Good But Not Excellent !,"Juanes is a very complete artist, it is of the best Latin cantautores that there is, the truth I love this album, although I don't change a lot to the previous one it is very good, I love La Camisa Negra, Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor is of the best, the Only bad of the disk is Damelo it is an unconscious song and it is Very Bad, The Album advises it to all the lovers of the Latin Rock.I qualify him As 4.5"
1,Don't make a mistake. Don't buy it,"""Mi sangre"" is bad. all the songs are weak. I only bought it because i heard the two albums before it and I thought this would be as good as the ones before but when I was done with listening the album I was very disappointed, I couldn't believe that music was from Juanes. It's terrible. it sounds like music for babies . THIS ALBUM IS BAD"
5,muy muy bien,"I love Juanes, own his first two CDs, saw him in concert once. This disc is different from his first, but it is clearly Juanes. No fan's collection is complete without it.Me encanta Juanes y tengo sus discos y lo he visto en vivo una vez. Este disco es muy diferente de sus otros, pero es Juanes. La coleccion de un aficionado necesita este disco."
4,el mejor disco de juanes,este disco es lo mejor que ha sacado juanes todas las canciones son muy buenas y movidas ademas de que tiene buena voz y deben de comprarlo
1,Que Horror !,"Bueno la musica de juanes es realmente buena pero se ha vuelto un hueco tatalmente, su musica es muy comercial no era como cuando lanzo su primer album, el segundo todavia era bueno, pero este es un asco lo peor, deberia cambiar de formula no utilizar lo mismo de Un Dia Normal, la peor cancion es la de la Camisa Negra, pero bueno el hace lo que quiera si a la gente le gusta que bueno, pero a mi no me interesa tener una copia barata de Un Dia Normal."
2,Lame! Juanes worst album so far,Fijate Bien = ExcellentUn Dia Normal = GoodMi Sangre = WTF???Please Juanes stop making gay music and get back to your roots!
5,Crowded House,"in Spanish , what else would I want ? . Great Stuff from another Rocker En Español . Clever and well delivered , like the best ..."
3,Happy Juanes gone mellow?,"I think right now Juanes's personal life is filled with love and he has every right to express that in his music, but he definitely has lost his edge and kick. I agree that this album was a bit disappointment, although if compared to his previous ""Un Dia Normal"", creating anything to live up to it would be really hard. I do not like the first half of this album at all, especially the first single ""Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor."" What's the deal with the oldies-like arrangement on the chorus part? Trying to be too poppy and catchy? ""La Camisa Negra"" is a copy from a similar song from his previous album. I now listen from ""Damelo"" and the rest, because there are better songs. But this is a very talented guy, so I still have faith in him for better efforts next time."
1,"""Mi Sangre"" NOT AT ALL AMUSING!!!","When I listened to the Cd, I was in for a very big dissapoinment. Juanes new Album ""Mi sangre"" is not at all great. Only the first single is really worth listening too. This new Cd might sell well in the first weeks, and then become a Flop. This time Juanes rushed too soon making this cd, making some of the songs sound very childish and not meaniingful. His previous album is 100 times better than this new one. I agree with another review where someone says: ""Only 2 or 3 songs are ok"" but the rest really lack something."
1,Este Hombre es un Ladron.,"Yo entiendo que a las mujeres les encanta, las vuelve locas. No las culpo por ello.Al fin y al cabo, los hombres mirabamos los partidos de tenis de Anna Kournikova no especialmente porque nos interesara el deporte.Por ende, si sos una mujer a la cual le gusta Juanes, y compras el disco porque tiene sus fotos y su voz, la cual te hace viajar en fantasias de amor con Juanes. Pues que lo disfrutes.Ahora, si de musica se habla. Este disco es Basura.Un ABrazoLeandro."
4,A Bit Different,The music in this CD is a bit different than what he's given us before-- but that doesn't make it any less better.There's something a bit more mature about him on this CD. It's a bit more edgy- a bit more rock- but all the songs are still undeniably Juanes.Great CD!
5,Poignant!,"Incredible lyrics and vocal arrangements has made this one enjoyable to listen to.i love it so much, the songs are just incredible!!A must buy!"
3,The Only thing Good!,"I am faithful follower of Juanes but the truth this album it is very bad, the only thing redeemable it is the song La Camisa Negra that is very sticky and very similar to the pay but it doesn't care, another that is good is Nada valgo Sin Tu Amor of Rest it is pure Garbage Of Filler."
2,Just NOT a good CD,"I loved the last CD from Juanes, that is why I bought this one without listening to it first. But I was really dissapointed. I listened to the whole thing with three of my friends (all loved Juanes' past CD), and only one of them wanted to borrow the CD to burn it, only b/c it was free, not because she liked it. NO lo recomiendo."
4,bueno,Good spanish rock. Two great singles (Camisa negra and Nada valgo sin tu amor) and ten other good songs makes this good cd.
5,Best Juanes album yet,This album was great. The music and the lyrics are the best Juanes has recorded yet. The album is very variable and uses many different kinds of instruments. The adition of a powerful electric guitar was essential for recording this great album.
3,"Aburido, pero no tan malo","Yo me compre Un Dia Normal y crei que era un buen album, y despues vi a Juanes en concierto y estuvo chevere. Pero este album no me motivo mucho.A los fanaticos del cantautor no les importa si saca un album con un mojon de cerdo en la cubierta, lo van a comprar. Igualmente los que esperaban lo mismo y como ven los cambios lo van a odiar.La verdad esta entre medio. El album es mediocre y tiene unas canciones buenas y otras que no valen la pena. Recomiendo conseguir las canciones que le gusten solas e ir a verlo en vivo."
4,Ay Juanes!,"Well, my opinion is that nothing surpasses"" Un dia normal"", but this album nonetheless is enjoyable and well-written. And the photos in the CD booklet are sooo sexy...You're looking good Juanes!!! Sexy!!"
2,what is happening juanes???!,"I must say that Juanes has given in to the mainstream market! I mean the money must be good!His first album ""fijate bien"" although a bit pop was still good with plenty of substance in the songs. Then the second album he took the direction i feared he'll take...the full-on POP direction and unsurprisingly it was successful for him.Now he just keeps at it. :(will the real juanes please stand up!"
1,Pop barato,"Es increible que la gente relacione a este cantante con el rock. Este CD es prueba de ello pues las canciones solo suenan a formula barata para vender. Su musica esta hecha para las masas para gustarle a la mayoria de la gente posible con el plan de vender y vender discos. Este hombre de rockero no le queda nada mas que el look y la imagen con la que se muestra. La camisa negra es una cancion tonta y me causa risa que la hayan censurado en un pais. Las otras canciones como ""Volverte a ver"" y ""Nada Valgo sin tu amor"" son igualmente aburridas y no aportan nada. Me sigo preguntando y no logro explicarme ?Donde quedo el rock en la musica de Juanes? simplemente no existe."
5,Excelente evolucion - Excellent evolution,Lo que mas me gusta de este disco es su sinceridad. Es cierto que es algo diferente a los anteriores pero es simplemente un reflejo de los cambios en la vida del artista. Una de las canciones mas nuevas y de las que mas me gustan es No Siento Penas dedicada a su nueva hija Luna.5 Estrellas por la autenticidad y sinceridad de este album. Siga asi Juanes!What I like the most about this album is its sencerity. It is true it is a bit different than his previous albums but this is merely a reflection of the recent changes in the artist's life. One of the newer songs and one of my favorites is No Siento Penas dedicated to his newborn daughter Luna.5 Stars for atuhenticity and sincerity in this album. Keep up the good work Juanes!
5,An instant classic,"Juanes is a real true force in the Latin market, and this album proves it.All the songs are great, and the singing and arrangement are fantastic.Juanes wrote all the song. This man is very talented.I seen him already three times in concert and he never dissapoints.This is a must have in your collection especially to those fan of Rock en Español. I really enjoy it alot. I hope his new album is as good as this one."
4,mellow pop,"originally i bought the album because i really liked ""la camisa negra"" but i've since fallen in love with the whole record; it's perfect wakeup music, mellow but never boring or annoying"
1,Menos de 1 estrella,Este album no merece siquiera una estrella porque es horrible. la musica sin ritmo y cada vez que escucho DAMELO me pregunto que es esto?!!
1,Un pesimo album(a terrible album),MUy decepcionado con este album. Los dos primeros discos de juanes muy buenos. pero este cd esta lleno de canciones terribles no tiene muy buenos cambios de sonidos y comite el error de comprarlo porque solo queria escucharlo pero me arrepiento. un terrible album
3,"Great music, annoying piracy protection","This is a great CD and I love this music. Unfortunately Juanes' record label has used technology to disable the disc's ability to be played on one's computer. So if the computer where you plan on playing it, forget about it."
5,All of the illustrated Holmes stories from The Strand,"First things first, for Kindle owners, there is an active Table of Contents!!This book has all of the Sherlock Holmes stories that were printed in ""The Strand"" complete with the original illustrations. I cannot empathize how much the illustrations add to the stories. I grew up with a copy of The Complete Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with the original illustrations and when I purchased a free version without the illustrations (and also without an active content table of contents) I just couldn't continue reading it (nostalgia for the original hard copy with illustrations I suppose)This is NOT however the complete listing of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories, the following listed below were not printed in The Strand and therefore and not included in this book,His Last BowThe Case-Book of Sherlock HolmesA Study in ScarletThe Sign of the FourThe Valley of Fear(I used to own these too and they are worth looking for!)"
5,From the pages of Strand,"I've already reviewed all of these wonderful stories in seperate reviews, but I just want to add here what a delight it was to read them in their original form. These pages are facsimiles of the Strand magazine, where Arthur Conan Doyle published many of his early Sherlock Holmes stories. The original illustrations by Sidney Paget are reproduced as well. This volume is a keeper."
2,"Thorough and Enjoyable, But Poorly Edited","As a long-time fan of Sherlock Holmes stories, I was delighted to find this collection for the Kindle. It's inexpensive, contains original illustrations, and has most of the Sherlock Holmes stories--what's not to like?However, as I began reading, I found this version to be riddled with editing errors. Most are merely distracting typos, but some verge on the absurd--e.g ""'It sounds high-flown and absurd, but consider the fats!'"" (sic)."
2,Misrepresentation,"The book did not have the image as shown on the second picture on the customer image section. The book is somewhat dilapidated & seems to have been used because having a fold on the middle back is not usual for a new book. This is the first time I am highly disappointed with my purchase. I hope that the other two books I am expecting would not be the same as this one. Kindly post of images w/c the customer would actually receive as this is causing a wrong expectation. A pence more would be ok as long as you get what is promised (as what most of the time the images suggests) because its heart breaking if you get something way less than you expected. As with the content, I suggest that they arrange the stories in chronological order as it appeared in The Strand."
4,Don't know what everyone's problem is...,"I really liked this book. I went into it expecting a romance novel, and that is what I got. The point of romance novels is that they are not supposed to be completely realistic and are supposed to have a happy ending. So far, I love Elizabeth Lowell's writing style."
2,Boring and trite,"Maybe I should have given this fewer stars, but I have always enjoyed Lowell's books and could not bring myself to give her such a poor rating. However, I do not buy her books any more. They all seem to be the same (though some might argue that all romance novels are the same): feisty heroine meets strong, silent, mustached (yuck!) man and they fight for most of the book before she gives in to his manly libido AND somehow falls in love with him......yawn......"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"One of the worst books I've ever read. The hero is a bigoted jerk who has formed a stupid prejudice on the basis of superficial observations. So he changes one such stupid opinion. He probably has hundreds of others. I couldn't respect or admire him, or her for falling for him. Add to her lack of character the way she handled the cattiness of his girlfriend.... by becoming even cattier. I'd never read a book by this author before, and I never will again."
1,horrible - what a disappointment,"I love Lowell's 'Donovan' and 'Rarieties' series and am starting to read her backlist. Well, if this is and example of the 'romance' of the eighties I know why I only started reading it about a year ago. The 'hero' is utterly unbearable, and the heroin's ability to accept verbal abuse is pathological! He considers her a whore from bhe beginning to the end, and she not only forgives him, but justifies his attitude. Honestly, after the first 50 or so pages I started skimming - it was just too dumb for words. Save your money"
1,Skip this one!,"I liked all of the Elizabeth Lowell books I had read up until this one. Sorry, but it's really bad. Some of the lines are so bad that I blinked and read them again just to make sure it said what I thought it said. The hero(?) hates beautiful models; so, of course, the heroine(?) is a beautiful model--except when she takes her makeup off. Then she is so plain that he doesn't recognize her and is able to love her. I might have liked her if she hadn't kept bragging on her own beauty. Read it, if you don't believe me, but don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Linc needs to see a shrink!,"I think Elizabeth Lowell is a good writer and this story was well written. However, I don't think any woman would put up with Linc, a self-professed hater of ""Beautiful Women"". When Holly makes a tranformation into the model ""Shannon"", Linc decides she is a whore and spends the rest of the book treating her like one. She should have punched him in the eye and left him to wallow."
2,worse than I ever expected,"I read the reviews on this book and didn't think it could be as bad as people were reviewing it. I was definitely wrong! This book is boring, repetative in what the main character says/thinks and completely wishy-washy. After getting into it a little bit, I was already rolling my eyes and decided I just couldn't take any more of it. Elizabeth Lowell is normally a great author, but steer very clear of this book..."
5,perfect gift for a 1-year-old,"My daughter can't get enough of this toy even after a few months, which is saying a lot with her attention span! The little figures are the perfect size for her hands, and she loves ""vrooming"" the car around, stopping to take people out and put them back in, and best of all, pushing the button to make the song play (over...and over...and over again). definitely one of her favorites these days!"
4,Very solid analysis,Very good analysis. Well written. An excellent read whether you are a beginner or somewhat versed in LatAm and US relations. It serves as a great review of history as well.
3,Good book for creative 'tweens,"This book has some of the worst looking, sloppily beaded flowers I have ever seen. Several of the patterns don't have any resemblance whatsoever to the actual flowers being referenced. The whole book seems geared to the level of a 10 year old. That being said, there were some really good (actual size) diagrams for leaves and flower parts. Except for the fact that the classic French technique was totally co-opted and dumbed down, it managed to hold my attention for quite a while. I wouldn't recommend this book for a first time flower beader, because you won't learn proper techniques, but there is a lot of information in here, and some of the patterns are pretty good. The Daffodil, Chrysanthemum and Iris are standard fare and as good as any basic patterns I have seen. The garlands are cute and will appeal to girls of all ages."
5,Dreamy blissed out heaven through a shimmering haze of noise,"FSA's danciest release to date. A comment which might seem completely erroneous, but they've always had a hypnotic, irresistible sound. And now they have regular percussion that impels you to swing your head around in a demented tribalistic rhythm. Swathes and swathes of guitar noise, fuzz and these mesmerising beats come at you demolishing any form of thought you had and lead your mind into a nether region of unrealised and undefined dreams, images and a simple delight."
3,Life is unlistenable,"This is my least favourite Flying Saucer Attack album. The aspect I like best is the heaviness of the beats and bass on the first few tracks, which give them a weird, home-made kind of power. This album is kind of ugly, but it's totally unique."
4,who needs rick cobb,over all i would say this was bloodrocks best but i missed jim rutledge on drums take a close listen to bloodrock 1 rutledge was heart and soul while cobb was good he could not match the heart of rutledge
4,SOME GEMS AMIDST SOME MISSES,"Lapsed dramatics aside, Bloodrock 3 remains a cornerstone of early 70s psychedelia. Great, great organ riffs, abstruse lyrics, fine guitar licks. If I ever get to make a film about the early 70s, late 60s, it will certainly pay homage to ""Kool Aid Kids"" or ""Jessica"". I remember when they opened for Grand Funk in '71 when I was a tot. I forgot Grand Funk and went out and bought Bloodrock 3. Oh, that was the road to abacadabra and perdition, indeed!"
4,"The capstone of Bloodrock's ""death trilogy""...","...is the song ""Breach Of Lease"". This is a much more ambitious number--it deals with the death of Mother Earth due to war, misuse of resources and destruction of the environment. Ironically, though, not only is this song the weakest volume of this ""trilogy""--other artists have done at least as well on this topic. A shame, really--this one has the best hooks. Like a bass part a lot like the one that drove the Doors' classic ""Riders On the Storm"", plus a shimmering organ part that makes you stop and remember that there were no synthesizers in rock back then--you're listening to a standard Hammond here. Plus, this was the last album featuring the husky voice of Jim Rutledge."
5,Very good stuff,This is a great recording. If you appreciate really tight drumming and crisp chord changes you'll like this. I rank this album among my personal top 10 all time. It's no-noncense. It all has meaning. Rutledge has a unique voice. Great timing. They go from fast to slow with the best of them on this. It's all good. Breach of Lease is my favorite but I love them all. I truely think someone needs to re-do these. A wonderful gem to be found for many.
4,Good for the price,Worked well but I do a lot of wood working and go through bits more than the average person - still a good buy! I would buy again.
5,Awesome!,"This book is great. Erich Maria Remarque almost (and I repeat, ""almost"") outdoes All Quiet on the Western Front. 509, Lebenthal, Bucher, Weber, Neubauer, Karel, Ahasver, and ""the sheep dog"" are very engrossing characters, and I felt as though they were actually real people as I read it. The plot is great, and I could easily picture the setting in my mind. I was definately satisfied at the results between the conflict with 509 and Weber. The translation is a little rough at times, and the terms ""revolver"" and ""tommy gun"" were used throughout the story in a meagerly generic way. Overall, great book!"
4,A different perspective on the Nazi concentration camps,"As 509 is a German political prisoner, and not a Jew or Pole, this book offers a somewhat different perspective on the Nazi concentration camps than is usually found in novels. This is a powerful book, though it has Remarque's usual dark tone and 'unhappy' ending. I highly reccommend it as a complement to other fiction about this era."
5,A masterpiece about the Nazi concentration camps,"Powerful. Spring 1945, Germany refuses to accept the inevitable defeat. This is the story of a concentration camp during the last months of war. One of the important themes of the novel is that as the allies converged on the concentraion camps the situation for the prisoners became more desperate. A high percentage of deaths occured during these last weeks as Germans ran out of supplies, tried to erase evidence and forced prisoners to walk to different locations farther inside of Germany."
4,"gripping tale of horror, and of indominatable human spirits","""The Spark of Life"" is a gripping tale of fear, horror and death by a masterful writer, but it is also a tale of the indomitable human spirit. The story Remarque tells is all the more terrible for being based in reality, a recounting of historical events as they played out at the end of World War Two for the inmates of a German concentration camps. I read this book in high school, and found it hard to take; in fact it stayed with me for years. That's of course to the author's credit. This is a book that deserves to be read, as long as the reader knows what s/he is getting into."
1,"No USPS option, no Amazon email. Couldn't even buy the product.","I would love to buy and praise this product, but Crucial Technologies does NOT ship via USPS, therefore does NOT ship to PO Boxes. Also, Crucial Technologies does NOT have any way to contact them via Amazon e-mail.Why would they limit customer options? From my past experiences, Amazon affiliates have made an effort to make me a customer, yet Crucial Technologies seem to be an exception.The lowest possible Amazon rating is one star, so that's what I give, the lowest possible, even as they deserve zero stars from me right now, hoping that Crucial Technologies soon shape up and ship out, dragging themselves up the ladder from the lower echelons of indifferent, mediocre status as an Amazon affiliate."
5,Absolutely TOP GRADE A#1,"LIVE at Chicago Aphitheatre is one of the greatest ass kickin live albums ever released! Although recorded in 68, the only thing about this release that is dated is the opening introduction and monologue by someone (probably a DJ) asking for ""a line down the middle for drug rescue"". The music is timeless, highly ELECTRIC, rock with driving beats and classic kickass lead guitar. This album is a must for anyone who enjoys clean, high energy music (even the blacker pieces like DOA) that actually has lyrics that aren't brainless.BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW!"
2,remember I own you,First off this cd or any other for that matter is not worth 40 bucks. I was lucky enough to listen to it in it's original vinyl record form. It's the usual kind of rock from the 70's featuring the organ. Some of the songs sound good and others just don't rock out that much but it's still a decent 70's rock album worth checking out if that's your kind of music.
4,Car Camping - Works Great,"This twin bed worked well and fit nicely in our 2009 Subaru Outback. It was difficult to fully fill the bed (we wanted it to be more firm) with the provided nozzle though, even with the matching 12V pump. The additional pillow section is much appreciated although we were initially concerned about it."
4,How far would you go to save a friend?,"ISBN 0394882938 - How far would you go to save a friend? And can a pig BE your friend? Well, Hartley and Josh think one can, especially a swimming pig named Marlon, and they'll go quite far to save him - they'll even pignap him!This is a cute book for young readers, who will enjoy the daring midnight rescue effort to save Marlon's bacon and keep him off the breakfast tables of America for good. Readers might develop a temporary aversion to pork products, but all the Marlons won't mind that a bit!- AnnaLovesBooks"
3,OK,I got this CD to complete my Fania All Stars Collection but didn't really care for most of the songs. It's classic Fania All Stars and for that I give it 3 stars but as far as it being one of the CD I keep in my CD player...don't think so. Sorry.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I just purchased the cable and shipping was fast but then it was all down hill. I hooked it up to my HD-DVD player (my Samsung plasma doesn't have HDMI so I got this cable). I use hundred dollar Monster M1000 which are the top of the line component cables, so I wasn't expecting much of a difference from generic brand HDMI-DVI cables. When I plugged it in it blew me away. How much worse the picture got! After about five minutes the signal got all pixilated and then just froze (it wasn't my HD-DVD players fault it said cable error on the screen on the player). Well I suggest you go buy a Monster Cable and HDMI converter also by Monster to get what you paid for that's what I am doing."
1,The Golden Twernties is a Leaden Dud,"I teach Shaddup 101 in state prison, so I needed an overview piece of that fun decade - none of which comes through in this useless clunker. This one was concocted from the Joe Friday School of History: This Fat Guy hit a lot of home runs, then this guy flew across the Atlantic, then people danced funny and so on. By trying to include everything, they cover nothing and they made it boring as well. Save your money."
1,Obviously seconds product.,"The ret eyepiece arrived with a chipped 1st lens and an illuminator that would not operate unless you twisted it back and forth a few times and would not stay illuminated for more than 20 seconds. I shipped it back and requested a good working order replacement; only to be told that they could not replace it due to some agreement with Amazon, and that they would refund my money and I would have to order another. So basically I was shipped a seconds product and now have no eyepiece and am out the return shipping costs. Not a good experience."
3,Celin Dion,"Songs are very few, I was expecting more songs. otherwise I enjoyed singing most of the songs. The cd cover was broken but the cd was okay so its okay"
4,Moss Edged Birdhouse,These are exactly as pictured. Interesting and just the right size for small birds.My only concern is how the 'raw' wood will stand up to year round weather.Perhaps we should review them after a year of use.
1,Cheap. Sent it back,This is very cheap and came to me with broken pieces. It also sheds the moss. They glue it together.
2,Mossy birdhouse not worth the money,Quite a bit of MOSS had fallen off( ? in transit) and it is cheaply constructed. I was disappointed about the product
1,All the moss had fallen off during shipping!,"I fell in love with this cute birdhouse when I saw it on Amazon.com. It would look awesome on my fence post in the backyard. I have tons of birds and this would be a perfect addition to the yard. The birdhouse took a long time to arrive and when I opened the box I was so disappointed to see that all the moss had been knocked off of the roof and also the sides. I'm assuming it was due to how they shipped it. The item wasn't wrapped appropriately! The little dowel used for the bird to rest on, came unglued and was knocked off. I found it inside the house. It's adorable in the picture but it didn't look like the picture when I opened the box. Needless to say, I returned it for a refund."
1,The Great Disappointment !!!,"The cutter is all wrong and the speed is way too fast, turns everything to mush... they obviously took an existing Dremel tool, made it orange and tried to sell it for pumpkin carving.. they should stick to metal and wood for the hobby customer."
3,Not what I expected,"This Pumpkin Carver should be called a ""Pumpkin Skinner"". It's great for patterns that call for you to skin (remove only the top layer instead of cutting all the way through) the pumpkin for a glowing effect. But I did not find it very effective for actual carving, even though I went and bought a carving bit (not included with Dremel). So: great for skinning, but only average, at best, for carving."
3,A Decent Tool Under The Right Conditions,"There didn't seem to be any reviews of the Dremel tool on fake pumpkins, so here's my two cents. I purchased the Dremel Pumkin Carver after searching for a tool built for fine detail work on the increasingly popular fake foam pumpkins, and I was a little underwhelmed. Depending on what you want to do with it, the 1/8"" cutter included with the tool was a little cumbersome and best suited for removal of large areas of the pumpkin. I went out to buy separate cutters to work more efficiently. The design makes it slightly difficult maneuver in tight spaces, and the low speed only causes the tool to bounce around the face of the pumpkin, so stick with high speed for better control. Plus, while not entirely unexpected, be prepared for a lot of dust if you want to go down this road. Not a bad tool, but in the end I've gone back to the X-Acto knife to carve the fake jack-o-lantern."
3,Missing Cutting tools,I gave both my daughter and son's families a 764-04 in time for Halloween but the units arrived without any cutting tools. What is one to do with a well made power motor and no tools?Please let me know as I would like to complete this purchase.signed DissapointedWK
2,Dremel tool,"It is a nice item, but was not explained very well in the write up. I would like to return it. Could you please advise me on my return?ThanksJohn Balderson"
1,Has anyone actually managed to get this to do anything?,"I read the instructions, tried to use it, found that it rubbed semi-uselessly against the pumpkin, pitched it, and went back to using clay carving tools. Wasted money."
1,"Pumpkin Carving ""TOOL""....","I purchased the ""tool"" to carve some pumpkins at a party. AND IT DID NOT WORK WELL - in fact - IT SUCKED!! I am SO NOT happy with this item!! When the discription says ""Pumpkin Carving Dremel"" to me that means CARVING!!! Not scraping away a few layers which is exactly what it did! RETURN if possible?? DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ALL DAY SCRAPING AWAY LAYER AFTER LAYER OF YOUR PUMPKIN! Do yourself a favor and spend the $3.99 on a ""CARVING KIT!"". Item SUCKS!!!"
2,"Total P.O.S. and DANGEROUS, MELTED ON ME!!","This tool was working great for the first few pumpkins my friends and I were carving until the batteries overheated in it causing one to rupture and melt internals in the tool, whether this was the tools or batteries fault I can't be sure but I know this thing got the batteries and the tool itself VERY warm prior to it beginning to smoke and melt. Maybe I got a defective one again as the tool worked great up until it melted on us, if you are getting this for children to use keep an eye on the temperature of the device!"
3,not what I expected,"This is an interesting book, with some good problems to solve, but I was expecting a book that would relate math to chess, instead this is a book that uses the chess board and the game of chess to solve mathematical problems, this book does nothing to help with understanding chess or improving your game."
3,Good...but not beginner's,"I just started exercising again and decided that this would be a good choice. And the 7 day routine plan also caught my eye.Sadly it wasn't what I expected. All seven days use the same scenes, just arranged in a different order. Also the constant change of angles makes it difficult to enjoy. The scenes don't blend smoothly, and the instructor is annoying at times.But it is a good workout and you will get a good sweat out of it if you can get through the video."
3,O.k. Work Out,"I ordered this item to try and get back on a work out schedule. It was o.k. for the first few days, but then I felt like I was not wanting to use the video anymore."
5,16 Wow,Squirrel bait were in high school when they recorded both their records. It's amazing that kids that young could produce such amazing music. I was in a band at 16 and it sounded like a bunch of 16-year-olds. These kids ROCKED !!! If your a Discord fan check these guys out. Great 1985-86 Pre EMO I just wish the recording was better.
5,Please check these guys out.,"Louisville's own Squirrel Bait, the band who would later form Slint (without Peter Searcy) hits a homer with their debut. Although production is better on their next release, Skag Heaven, the songs here are superior.With less than 10 reviews, it's obvious this music has been overlooked, and that's too bad. However, with today's barren musical landscape, this album would be a real treat for those as yet unexposed to it. Get it from Amazon, new or used, because it's doubtful even the most eclectic music store would have a copy."
4,He does it again.,"This CD is just a solid from start to finish. This stayed in my deck for a week straight. Damn near every track on here you can just put on repeat. The production is heat, slaps from top to bottom. I was a little disappointed with the first track, only because I wore it out when I bought the 23109 soundtrack. And he has yet another Super Hyphy remix on this one but those are the only two disappointments for me. Go cop it, CD's of this quality just don't come out anymore. 11 slumpers out of 13 tracks. PICK IT UP!! Support Bay Music!"
3,Not Braided as Pictured,The picture clearly shows a braided cable. The one I got is just a plain cable. It serves the purpose for which it was designed but not as pictured.
5,Long lasting,"This is great, our first born, loved it and now our second baby also enjoys playing with it. It has lasted for over 3 years and it still works great, even the battery still plays."
4,Cute like all Lamaze toys,"My son has this except it has different colors as those shown here..but it's just as cute, he likes to take it by the tail and drag it across the room and chew on it, I think the sections of the worm that he likes the most are the ones that make crinkle noises. I gave it 4 stars because even though he's 14 months now he still can't get the music to play when he presses the head since you need more force. we have other Lamaze toys like the owl and the moose and those seem to grab his attention more than this one."
5,Loves It!,"We bought this for our granddaughter when she was nearly 2 months old, and she has loved this toy from the beginning. She always had a ready smile whenever she saw its face and heard the tune. We even brought it on walks and in the car to keep her company! As she has developed, she has continued to play with the inchworm, and enjoy it in new ways. We have watched her love this toy so much, that it will be a favorite gift to get for future babies!"
2,"Agreed on ""not so musical inchworm"" comments","Disappointing. It's really hard to get it to ""play"", and it's offensive to call the sounds coming out of it ""Hallmark card's ones"", as hallmark cards rock compared."
3,Music could have been better,"Music is ok, but my 6 month old son loves feeling the different textures in the worm. At first I regretted buying this for him since there are so many other functional learning toys out there, but he seems to like it, especially when he's rolling over, he will reach out for it on his play mat and play with it for a little while."
4,Baby,"I gave this as a gift to a little one and he loves it, after he figured out what he was suppose to do with it."
3,Decent.,Lamaze products are amazing because they are so cute and colorful. The problem? They all seem to do the same thing. We received this as a gift and while its cute and cuddly its not a favorite. Like another person posted it can nicely be used to prop a child up for tummy time...and could be cute to take pictures of next to. But...we got two inchworms...and the other one we got the pieces actually come apart so you can connect the inchworm together & it sings. And while connecting the pieces is harder for a newborn to do (ok impossible!) it definitely grows with the child! My 2.5 year old is entertained by it and allows the two kids to play together...so...nix this worm and go look for the other one!
5,Baby loves it!,"We bought this for our son when he was 2 months old, and at that time he was completely mesmerised when we wiggled, squeaked and crunched it above his head. It stopped his grumbling straight away, and he smiled at it more than us! Now he is 4 months and it is still by far his favourite toy - he particularly loves the squeaking and rustling sounds - and he can now chew and cuddle it.Other reviewers have said that the musical part doesn't work, or that the song is too short, but I haven't had that problem at all - in fact, our baby sets off the music just by chewing on the worm's head. I'm not sure if having toys that continually play tinny music is such a desirable thing, anyway. We bought this DESPITE the fact that it was musical, not because of it. Perhaps if you're looking for music, you should buy a CD.I would highly recommend this for young babies, and I can see it remaining a favourite for a while to come. The best money we've spent so far."
4,inch worm,"my son likes to chew the little legs, but is not all that into cuddling it. It seems to be great for propping them up under the arms while on their belly. he likes the crinkly noise. Does not play music, wish that it did. Only has very brief music when push the head."
3,Good,I like the different textures for my 3 month old to touch.Dislike the music - it's very cheap sounder. I prefer it not to make noise than what's on it.Overall a nice buy!
5,Great textures for touching!,"The vibrant colors and the varied textures, materials are good visual stimuli. The length of toy is good, for pulling and rolling around."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I wasn't thrilled...it's ""OK"". I was hoping it would be more like the singing caterpillar that was available about 4 years ago."
2,Not so Musical,"I normally can't get enough of Lamaze toys. They are usually wonderful baby and toddler toys, but this particular one disappointed me slightly. First of all, the music is very quiet and electronic sounding. It sounds like the music you might get from a cheap toy at the dollar store. There is also no way to replace the battery, so when it stops it's done for good. The textures and rattles are great, but other toys have these as well. I would recommend a different Lamaze toy."
3,"Meh, it's just a worm","I had high hopes for this ""musical"" inchworm. Unfortunately, I was a little let down. Let's start with some pros, because everyone wants to hear the good news first! This is indeed an inchworm. There are inches on it and everything. AND, there are interesting patterns and sounds (crinkly body, squeaky toy) for baby to play with. I mean, my kid liked this toy, he wasn't wild about it and I probably could have saved my money but I thought it was really cute. However, there is a big con that cost this puppy (not really a puppy, it is a worm) 2 stars. It claims to be musical, well that is just junk! Yes yes, you can push a really awkward button in it's head, and if your house is soundproofed then you might be able to hear it! It is so quiet and there is no way my son could ever produce the music alone. I would say just buy another lamaze toy, as they are all pretty similar and I found the bug one was way better."
1,Completely boring,"My 15 month old daughter has absolutely no interest in this toy. We bought this for her when she was around 6 months old or so and she has never played with it. It doesn't do anything. I think there is one spot that will play a little bit of music when you squeeze it, but that's about it. Save your money."
2,So what is this toy supposed to do?,"I know not every toy is supposed to be entertaining or stimulating, but this toy was a let-down. We initially bought the worm, thinking our son would like the large size, explore the different body sections, and react to the music. Unfortunately, the music when you squeeze the head is so soft, it took my husband and I a second to realize it was coming from the toy. After presenting it to our 5 month old, he lost interest in it very quickly and never wanted to play with it again. Now, it just sits in his room, neglected, and will be dontated to a charity very soon."
1,Not satisfied,I bought this toy for my baby. He was not only disinterested in this toy but he totally ignored it. The toy for it to make music you have to press it very hard. And the button is hidden at a difficult place. You would require great strength to make it create music. It is just a piece of clothe wringed like a caterpillar with some colors. waste of money.
4,Great for both my kids!,"I have both a 2 year old and a 6 month old and both kids love this toy. My oldest loves it because of its colors; he likes to announce them in Spanish. My littlest loves it because of the rattle and the brightness and textures of the colors. I love it for the price. My only complaint is that the music is tinny and insubstantial...it's two steps above a dog whistle in my opinion. Otherwise, it proves to be interesting to kids of various ages and it is undoubtedly cute and inoffensive (as far as obnoxious noise or music). This would make a great baby shower gift."
3,So So,"Kinda big for a baby. The inch line is useless... really, it's for a baby! Thought it would be great, but doesn't get played with much."
3,Cute,"It's a cute little Worm...but the Tinkle, Crinkle, Rattle and Squeak worm is way cuter and my baby doesn't ignore that like she ignores this worm. This one has music if you mash it's head but she still ignores it. I think it's because the other worm is softer and more snuggly than this product is."
3,Thought it would have more sounds,"I bought this toy for my daughter who hasn't arrived yet so I don't know what her opinion of it will be. I was a bit disappointed because I thought each section of the worm would have a different sound and/or texture. The textures are all the same and two of the sections crinkle when you squeeze them and two of the sections rattle...that's it! I was hoping that there would be a squeek and something scratchy, etc. but we will see! Other than that though it is very well constructed and the colours and very nice and bold."
5,So cool,"This inchworm is bright, fun, and my daughter loves it. It makes all sorts of different sounds, and the ""head"" plays music, which cracks her up. You can also measure your little one with the underside...my baby is bigger than the inchworm now, but it was fun to see her growth with this toy. Lamaze toys are the best."
2,No interest,"I got this when my son was five months old. He had little interest in it. I liked the fact it had all the sensory options, like a crinkly section because he really likes anything that crinkles. Just not this toy apparently."
2,Not so Happy..Not clapping hands,"We ordered this through Amazon and it was filled by ""We Best Store"". The inchworm is supposed to play 'If you're happy and you know it..', instead it plays something that sounds identical to 'Dance the Night Away' by J.LO. Not sure if it is a counterfeit, but it certainly calls the standards into question. Otherwise, it seems fine."
3,Never got into it,"I ordered this because it looked like my baby was going to like it after he saw it at a friend's house, but he never got into it. For a minute liked the rustling areas, but that passed."
5,Baby Loves It!,We received this as a gift and my son couldn't love it more. He started really focusing and holding it at about 9 weeks. Each section has a different tactile experience and bending the head just right makes music. Perfect car seat companion.
5,Perfect Caterpillar,My 3 month old grandson just loves this little caterpillar in his car seat with him so he can scrunch the different sections of it with his hands. he will sit there and be scrunching it in both hands and shaking it and smiling. it is the perfect thing to help him use and learn his hand coordination and learn all the new sounds and textures.I love it.
3,Just okay,"I think this toy is really cute. I got for my son when he was 5 months old, and he isn't as impressed. He'll play with it sometimes and chews on the little knots, but not for very long. He's just not that into this toy."
5,cute,"I bought this for my baby girl and she loves to stare at the big eyes as well as the different colors on the body. Has recently started to touch and shake it to make noise and enjoys playing with ""Inchy"". This is a nice toy to last a while as baby grows and is also fun to measure baby with the ruler on the back."
3,useful,I actually only got this toy because it is perfect for my preemie son's physical therapy. It can be placed under the arms to help him learn to hold his head up.He loves touching it and such but the musical part is disappointing.
5,Adorable!,I bought this for my 9 month old nephew for Christmas and he wouldn't stop playing with it. All the different textures and noises it makes kept his interest for some time.
3,Cute toy,This is a cute toy for younger babies. It's colorful and makes fun noises. They only problem I had was the music was very very hard to hear.
2,BORING,"We played with this toy some. All the different noices and rattles, I guess, are supposed to be educational, I don't see much value in it from educational standpoint. OK, the inchworm parts make different sounds, but why? They all look the same other than the color variation which has nothing to do with the sounds. And the music is cute hence the two stars, but it is only one song and soon becomes boring. Impossible for a baby, even young toddler to turn it on. I eventually tought my son to whack it on the floor hard to turn the music on. Not too good solution. I do NOT recommend this toy, unless you get it given. It does some, but not worth the money to my opinion."
2,"Merely Colorful. And forget about ""music""","I think this toy is very cute and colorful and that's about it. As others have said, it's pretty boring and the baby ends up mostly hugging it or mouthing it (but he mouths anything). Each worm segment has something inside, but the worm is so plush you have to press pretty hard. He much prefers his other toys and i suspect this worm will soon become just a room decoration. Oh, and the music is very tinny and ANNOYING-it's not loud but it's high pitched, which is the worst combination."
4,"Great for tummy time,",Like other said its not so musical but it is entertaining to my little one all the same. The colors and sounds are fun to explore
5,My baby just loves this toy!,"This toy was a good buy for my baby because it makes her laugh and smile just by hearing the ""happy and you know it"" song."
3,A little disappointed,"My 6 month old grandson loves this toy, BUT... I had to sew one of the legs back on and reinforce the others after he played with it for only one day. This definitely presented a safety issue if not repaired. Also, the fabric on the underside and head is fuzzy and attracts dirt like a dust mop. It looked very dirty after a very short time. I had to scrub it to get it looking clean again. The concept of the toy is great but the execution in construction is lacking."
3,Its definitely what I ordered.,"But if you wanted a copy of Donkey Kong Country 2 ported to the GBA youre in for a surprise. The whole layout of the areas is changed. Also the music is not the same. The sound effects are different and the enemies sound different. If you really think about it, the GBA is just a smaller Super Nintendo. I figured it would be the same, but alas its not. But if you just wanna good GBA game, I would definitely buy this."
3,HARD!!!,"This game is great but I haven't even finished it yet! I've been playing it on and off because of it's difficulty. Otherwise, eveything else is great."
5,Donkey Kong Country 2,"WHAT HAPPENED ? . That monkey is on the loose again...This is one of the most intense and enjoyable games ever. My hat`s off to the monkey, Hours of FUN....Eric"

1,NOT the Warner's restored volumes. Just a PD re-issue.,"CAUTION: This is NOT a two-pack of the first two Warner Home Video Popeye volumes that were restored from the 35mm nitrate masters.This is just a re-packaging of two public-domain Popeye releases.Get the real thing instead!Popeye the Sailor: 1933-1938, Vol. 1Popeye the Sailor: 1938-1940, Vol. 2"
5,A Grand Illusioin,"You don't have to spend alot of money to do some really cool magic ! The Magic Bird Cage Paddle is simple to use yet it has that "" Wow "" factor ! I have used it in my routine many times and it never fails to get the reation that every magician hopes for . . . WOW !"
3,SOMONE TURN UP THE VOLUME,"VERY VERY mid tempo, wash out WORKMANSHIP LACKING SPECIFIC MOMENTS OF HHHHHHIGHS NOR LOWS, HATE TO SAY IT KINDA BLAND,although GOTTA FIND A WAY ,maybe,MAKES THIS a classic keeper,JUST WISH THE RECORDING was more REAL,cause JIM rutredge can really SING,with the best off em,FORGET JAEGGER,FORGET ROD, AND COCKER,ETC, im talkin hes up there with Rusty Day of cactus,"
1,I tried once again.,"Okay, so Im a fanatic for the last 3 albums w/Warren Ham and got carried away including some songs that didnt, BUT SHOULDVE made it to 'TT'! Well on to this one here - the major complaint I have about THIS LIVE disc is that it CAME OUT after the first farewell-the 'USA' album and NOTHING is represented from that record! It makes me surmize that the group was already in turmoil, had broken up, and needed a 'product' to suave the fans AND their contract w/Capitol. Plus the delivery of 'Breach of Lease' 'DOA' and even 'Jessica' is routine'rouser rock.' Most of these songs were performed way too much in a GFR vein. (okay so there was a second guitar and keyboards- but that didnt help any...so) For those WHO CANT get enough-this one definetly fits in with the Uriah Heeps, Deep Purples, Cactus',Black Sabbaths, GFRS, and all the others who had that 'particular interchangle sound.'"
5,How many times have you felt trapped in,"something you don't want to do, or go against your will to some place you don't care for ?Just because you didn't know how to say NO, from the beggining...Yes, the negative is very hard when you dont master the art of saying NO without hurting any feelings...This is the real art of saying no and getting of unwished situations !!!"
4,It does what it is supposed to.,I have no complaints. Works well for what it is designed for; hair grooming. Ease of use is a nice plus to this razor. The different heads go on and come off with no fuss. The beard and hair guards assure accurate hair length for which I am pleased. The only thing I would change about it would be the water resistance/proofing for which it has none.
4,Very good unit,"This is an excellent little kit, besides the standard beard and mustache trimmer(s) (which works really well) it has lots of additional attachments including one that allows you to do nose and ear trimming, which I must say is a nice little bonus. This unit does the job as well as anything else I've ever used and makes very straight cuts. With all the attachments it's a very good bang for the buck.The reason for only 4 stars is because it is not water proof/resistant and it does not have a battery level indicator which are minor inconveniences but would be nice to add to future models."
1,save your money,"Norelco grooming kit - Bought it at cost co. To embarrassed to bring it back for a refund. Cheaply made, adapter broke first time. Over the years I have had trouble with all Phillips and Norelco products, i9.e;.l water piks, electric toothbrush. They need to find a reliable manufacturer in China or better yet, made in the U.S."
4,another good one from fisher-price,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew since i had a similar one for my daughter. Fisher-Price toys tend to hold up to a lot of wear and tear. I am thinking about getting this for my son also.
1,Use with Caution,"After our very first experience of our cat urinating on our brand new mattress, we bought this product and applied as directed. The urine stain was about 8 days old when we discovered this product, Nature's Miracle. After the application, the urine smell came back even stronger than had we done nothing. We kept the cat out of the bedroom for two days as the application was heavy and it had to dry. Once dried, we put new sheets on the bed and the very same night we discovered cat urine in the very SAME spot on the mattress. I'm disappointed in this product as it did not remove the smell, in fact, it amplified it. Use with caution."
3,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES,"Purchased this DVd from Amazon, but although the item description says it has English subtitles, the DVD sent to me did not contain any subtitles whatsoever. Had to return the DVD. Amazon should correct its item description."
4,Of can and cannot,"Actually rude comedy from the age when AIDS was not an issue as two pilots and stewardesses did not waste time entertaining each other, passengers and locals on islands ""Banana Air"" made to.A very idea: true love cures potentia, which is a laugh itself.Nice music, easy watching, some hints on deeper pornography in the movies of the seventies oncoming."
5,Proof you can't go wrong with TK,"And to think these songs were castoffs, or not worthy of inclusion on a proper cd release. 3/4 of these are brilliant. I own all his cd's and this one is right up with the best. Maybe not quite as good as Songs From the Film, or The Real Underground, but definitely a winner. Big kudos to Not Lame for putting this together. One of the best releases of the year so far."
5,One of the best beginning astronomy guides,"The Sonoma County Astronomical Society (SCAS), California has an annual program, whereby they give away several decent quality 6"" telescopes to children in the county's schools. This program (STRIKING SPARKS) is now in its 27th year. Along with the telescopes, we also include a ""goodie bag"" with tools and accessories to help the nascent astronomer learn how to use his/her telescope. 365 STARRY NIGHTS is part of that goodie bag. It is one of two beginning astronomy books (the other is Terence Dickinson's NIGHTWATCH) that I recommend to anyone who asks me about getting started as an amateur astronomer. I am a retired secondary school science teacher and an active member of SCAS and two other astronomy organizations. More about the STRIKING SPARKS telescope give away program go to [...]"
3,Not for me,"I bought this book because it got such great reviews, but the style just isn't for me. Hard to explain, the style is very attractively done with nice drawings, but I'm here to learn constellations and this book goes on and on about other things. Artistic though it is, it just isn't giving me the cold hard star formations I want. It does have many other interesting points, would be good for sharing with children interested in the stars. ore fanciful than most star books."
1,365 STARRY DAYS AND NIGHTS,THIS IS AN OLD OLD COPY OF THIS BOOK AND PRACTICALLY ALL WRONG WITH NO PICTURES AND POOR PAPER QUALITY. I WILL NOT EVER PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!
5,A Definite 5-Star Book!,"Chet Raymo has quickly become one of my favorite astronomy writers! This is a truly timeless book, with readable, understandable illustrations and explanations about our beautiful night sky and universe. He admits in his ""Introduction"" that his selection of things to be included in the book ""is entirely personal..."" which turns out for the reader to be fortunate, because he teaches some great things! The beginning amateur astronomer will appreciate his approach to the millions of wonders above, and the more experienced amateur will certainly continue to learn through his daily lessons. I've looked at a number of books to learn the night sky, and some are quite dry and even downright boring--not so with Raymo. Don't believe that this book is too elementary--it's full of information and passion for the beauty of the universe. Personally, I'm ordering more of his stuff tonight! I love this guy! Buy this book, you will not be sorry!"
5,A great book for every amateur,"This is a very good book for every amateur astronomer to have! It is very descriptive, helpful, and is even interesting to read! 365 Starry Nights describes the night sky by every month, so it helps create a sense of how the sky works. It touches on even the very small things, and describes the important things very well. It describes many of the types of distance measurers, like parallax and Cepheid variables. There are so many other things that it describes very well that I can't even list them all. The book covers many constellations and many of the things that are found in that constellation. All of those things make this book very informative and great. There is only one problem with the book. The book was published in 1982, so some of the information is outdate, which can be a small problem. Therefore you have to remember that every once in a while when they don't mention the Hubble telescope and you're wondering why! Overall, this book is a very good book!"
5,Song of love,After a long wait to get this very rare film have seen it three times . One of Hepburns finest performances and the music incredible .
3,Intersting life story,"Like so many biopics, it's hard to know what's real and what's invented in this movie (a tad disturbing in my eyes) but La Hepburn does a marvelous job as always and the story is very moving. If you like classical music, this is a great movie to see, both for the music and to get a bit of background on the Schumanns. Melodrama, sure, but, hey, that's not so bad on a cold winter's night!!"
2,Not the Greatest,"I have two of these cables. One works perfectly, but the other has problems keeping the audio in sync with the video. If I hadn't gotten them so cheep. I would be more disappointed."
3,I only buy them cuz they are cheap,"I've had to replace this cable once already. You might say, ""get better quality and you don't need to replace them,"" but for what I pay for them, it's worth the hassle. For one good monster cable, I can buy 20 of these. So if out of the 6 I've purchased only one needed to be replaced...I think that's a good deal."
3,Good low cost cables,"I can't say much about the signal quality, I've noticed no issues. The cables are a little stiff so I imagine they are not really durable, but so far so good for the price."
1,You get what you pay for,"I brought this HDMI cable wire to connect my Roku player to my HD TV. The first problem was that it arrived a week after the Roku player, but not the biggest deal. In the interim I used my HDMI wire from my upconverting DVD player since I would be streaming much of what I watched now.When I finally connected the newly arrived HDMI wire, the picture showed static. Though it played, the screen itself showed static (black and white or green dots) all over the picture. Knowing a little bit about TV's and connections it was easy to deduce something was wrong with the connection. I flipped the wires, changed the ports, disconnected everything to reconnect, reconnected only the Roku with that HDMI wire and even swapped the wire in different devices. Same problem. Good price, didn't work for me. At a $1.69 its not worth the hassle to return, but I probably won't buy from this supplier again."
3,Works with selected devices,"This cable didn't work with my Mac mini - there were flickers and blank screens on my Sony TV. I bought another cable for that.Surprisingly it works very well with my Google TV. Also, the GoogleTV is able to control the TV (Volume/power etc) when connected via this cable. So, it works but not sure why it wasn't working with mac mini."
2,My Review,The cables are nothing special. There good if you just want a cheap HDMI cable for your dvd player.
3,HDMI cables,I think hdmi cables should be thick and be flexible. When you plug in they should make a tight connection. I have tried a few and the best ones provide very clear picture transfer. This one is low priced but not sure about the quality
1,Poorly shielded,"These cables are poorly shielded and do not have a ferrite core, which made them very susceptible to static and high frequency noise. I was using them to connect to my Denon AVR-788 Home Theater and I was constantly getting static noise through the cables. It was bad enough to cause the audio to completely drop out altogether. I replaced them with some better shielded cables with ferrite cores and the problem went away. I got the cables [...], but the cables from the HDMI King look similar. They weren't that much more expensive either (I payed $[...] or a pair).The one positive for these cables is that when I use them without the Denon home theater, they work fine. Perhaps the Denon is just more sensitive to noise."
4,Great for the Price,"These cables are great for the price. They are not 1.3 certified and have no sound, but for my uses it's fantastic. I have this cable running from my PS3 and one from my Xbox 360 to an hdmi switcher that runs to my computer monitor. I run the sound from each of the systems through the RCA cables to my computer. If you plan on using the cables for this purpose they work just fine."
5,"Cheap as heck, isn't it!","Works fine, this cable. At first it showed a green stripe at the left side of my TV and was having trouble with the upconvertion of my HD player. But after I jittered the thing the green stripe went away and the upconvertion is fine as pie. Tested it with two HDTV's at 1080i. Crisp image on both. I haven't used any other HDMI cables so I can't compare, but looks a heck of a lot better than regular DVD so I guess it works OK!Can't go wrong at this price!"
4,Used for Xbox 360,"I bought this item for my Xbox 360 so it would have a better picture. It did great in that aspect. The detail is far better than the component cables i used to have. The one problem i have is my Xbox wont recognize is corecctly. It now thinks my tv is a widescreen but it's not. It cuts off the sides of the picture, no matter what it is, DVD, video game, Or just at the main menu. The setting to change from a widescreen to regular is now blacked out, not availible. To sum it all up, better picture by far but i can't figure out how to have my full picture back. But if you are planning to use it for Blu-Ray or something I think it will be fine. And the plastic around the plug is not that great. pretty crappy if you ask me, but it still functions great. Overall good. great for the price."
1,Buyer beware!!! Do Not Buy From the Seller Cmple!!!,"The product works fine but don't buy it from the seller CMPLE.You will end up paying more because from my experience, they didn't pay enough for the shipping and there was postage due.You will end up paying much more because of it.DO NOT BUY FROM CMPLE! You will regret it!"
1,Where is the connection,Those who buy TERK buy thus connector. SO THEY SAY. BUT --- where is the connection. There is none. To me this is a misrepresentation aimed at the novice in the digital TV era. (and who isn't?)
1,Wouldn't buy again,"Cable doesn't work properly, in fact I missed the season finale of Heroes because the whole episode skipped and pause and jumped. This has happened with many other shows, now I have to go buy a full price cable and I would recommend you just spend the money and get a good one."
5,"If you can afford a burger, you can afford a good HDMI cable",It's a 6' HDMI cable that sends a perfect signal for less than five bucks. The Name Brand cables can go **** themselves.
3,hdmi,workes great for ps3 but didnt work for hdmi cable there was no sound but fair product because of limited usage
4,It does the job for a great price,I was shocked at the range of prices for a HDMI cable so I just followed the reviews and spent a few bucks and am very happy with my purchase.
5,Cheaper than Wal-Mart and just as good,"It doesn't make sense to pay $40 for a cable. These are just as good, and it was longer than the one at Wal-Mart, which is what I needed to be able to run it through the wall."
5,Good cable.. cheap price,work as described.. why pay more than $10 for hdmi cable when you can get these for cheap
1,Does not work,"The HDMI cable did not work.At the price it was offered, my quality expectations were rather low. This time I guess I lucked out.The cable simply does not transmit any signal."
3,12 cent cable ???,"I had my doubts, but the cable actually works great.It is running 1080i Blu-ray on my 64"" TV."
4,do yourself a favor...,"Just go ahead and get the 15 ft cord. I promise that 6 ft isn't going to be long enough. This cord is fine, well made, and works like it's supposed to... but you're going to be sitting or standing directly in front of the television. you can find a longer cord for about a dollar more here on amazon."
2,Is a Category 1 HDMI cable,"Cable supports up to 720p and 1080i, but not 1080p. Will cause screen flickering and loss of signal, as well as and audio problems when trying to enable 1080p with this cable."
4,Simple and efficient,"Top quality item that completed the functioning of my Toshiba Blu Ray DVD Player.Again, price was a factor in mychoice of the product."
5,TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE....IS TRUE!,"We were extremely skeptical that the HDMI cables priced soooo low ($1.75?!!) would be any good, but figured we'd give them a try. Boy were we pleasantly surprised. These function as well as the high priced ($30 and up, up, up)HDMI cables that have previously purchased elsewhere. There was absolutely no difference that our eyes could detect. This was a case of too good to be true was really true. Swallow your skepticism, and try these. You won't be disappointed!"
5,great value,This is a great value compared to what it costs locally. Very hand cable for HD. You should always have a few extra around.
4,Cool,"These cables ship in bout a week and do what they're supposed to. They are a little flimsy and dont feel as securely plugged in to my devices as cables from a retail store, but they don't become unplugged or anything like that. Great Buy"
4,HDMI,"I have checked the prices of the product I was buying and yours was the BEST price!And it came in a few days, now, that's great service! This is my first time to order at amazon.com and I am very happy and satisfied. Thank you."
4,Good Cable/Low Price,This cable does everything it`s supposed to at a very low price. I don`t know if a higher end/more expensive HDMI cable would make any difference in picture quality. This one seems fine and arrived fast.
4,don't forget this with your blu-ray,I bought this with a new blu-ray because I hate having new things and having to run to the store and buy the item that I didn't realize I needed to operate it! I'm glad I did. It arrived quickly and allowed us to use our new blu-ray player as soon as it arrived.
2,works 98% of the time,This cable works great 98% of the time but for some reason loses connection about 3 or 4 times an hour for a few seconds. Had it for about 6 months now. Slightly annoying will try another cheap cable and see if it works. Bought 2 and used for xbox and blu ray player to my TV. Got another hdmi cable from my cable company and is hooked to my cable box and works perfectly.
4,Short but sweet,"Product costs less than 25% of retail. Shipment came quickly. Cable is a little short but worked well, but I decided to purchase a longer cord one so not to disturb location of equipment."
5,Ubelievable bargain,"I don't know how Amazon manages to sell this item for what it actually seems worth - a couple of bucks - but thanks, Amazon. Cheapest one available in my local Walmart was $12, and most go in the mid-20s."
4,Looks cheap works fine.,"I bought one of these for about $1.40 from importer520. It was cheaper looking than one i ordered months ago from another seller. The ends are made of hollow plastic and are larger than normal hdmi ends, so if you need them to fit in a tight spot then it may not. It works well though, and it is a fraction of the price of even generic cables at an electronic store."
2,Great at first....but,"I bought this cable along with a much more expensive, high quality version from Walmart. I compared them side by side and after a number of us viewed them both we decided we couldn't tell the difference.The cable worked great and was of high video and sound quality.Buuuut! Here I am just 4 months later and the thing is DEAD!!Since it was only a couple bucks, I *MIGHT* try again with the cheap cable.Keep in mind...there's a REASON it's being sold so cheaply.:("
1,Worthless,"These cables are a waste of your $1.50, avoid.They cause static flicker, pale colors, and image distortion. I bought 3 of these and compared them one by one on a blu-ray to an HDMI cable I bought for 10 bucks a couple months ago off amazon. All 3 caused such a low picture quality I put them in the trash as not mistakenly use them again.Don't spend less then 5 bucks on an HDMI cable. Think about it you have a 500 to 1500 dollar TV, a 200 dollar blu-ray player and 1000 dollar sound system. Don't sell your set up short by getting these. You don't need those waste of money `Monster Cables"", but you can't use these low grade cables either. Value your movie watching experience and get a cable worth owning, not these."
3,Arrived timely...haven't used it yet.,"I hope it works. The packaging is very much third-party...worries me a bit. but if it works, ""so what who cares?"""
1,HDMI cables.,"I purchased a HDMI cable. I feel these cables are over rated, and over priced. I do not see any didfference in using this cable over the cables the manufacturer provide with a TV or blue ray or DVD player. A comsumer is better off spending there money on something else and using the cables that come with the device you purchase.HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet)"
2,Not Good,"I needed a new HDMI cable to replace another cable that was too short. After arriving, I connected it from a BDR to a 720P TV. I set the resolution to 720p and started to stream a video. Everything seemed to work. At first, I was thinking what a great value, this was short lived. After awhile, maybe 30 minutes, the screen went black, which lasted about a half a second or so. I thought it was a fluke at first; but, it started to happen randomly. I tried the second cable I bought, same thing. Maybe I was just unlucky and got 2 bad cables, but I doubt seriously doubt it. I would not recommend these cables to any one. I wasted my money, I would prefer other people not waste theirs."
5,The best HDMI cable ever. Period.,"This are simply the best HDMI cables ever. Your loss if you buy any others. I'm not joking, these cables work amazing on my PS3. These cables shipped FAST! While I was waiting for the cables to arrive, I went to Wal-Mart to buy a temporary HDMI cable. I bought a $40 Sony HDMI cable. Could not tell a single difference between the picture and audio quality when these came and when I used the Sony ones. Overall, these cables are killer for the price. I would definitely recommend these!"
1,Stopped working,"Worked just great for a week then stopped working. Might be an idea to spend $5 more for a more reliable cable. Definitely don't buy one of the $20 + cables. The cable just needs to work, then it's just as good as the really expensive ones."
4,Great product for the price,If you are tired of getting ripped off at best buy or any other electronic store than this is the way to go.
4,Not bad for the price,"Work good so far just use 1 now. For the price and quality it's a good deal, hope it last long enough."
5,excellant quality and price,i did not expect this quality compared with the price but we use it and it works like charm connecting our lcd tv to the laptop :)
5,HDMI Cable,"This is a great, affordable product. Have it hooked up from SAT receiver to TV. Gets the job done. Now if I can just get my TV color settings correct!"
5,"Yup, that's a cable alright.","Bought 4 of these little suckers. And what else can I say.... they work like just like they were intended. And more importantly, still working months later.What is more alarming, is the ridiculous prices that places like Best Buy charge for these. 60 dollars.... really.... serious? I saw people post the phrase ""naive citizen tax"" and I have to admit, that is dead on. If there is a lack of quality in these cables, then I can't really tell the difference. There is probably some ""quality snob"" who will argue that I am loosing .0000000001% of picture quality not going with the leading brand, but I'm not willing to spend a $55 difference."
1,Lasted about 3-4 months.,We can't even play our new Blueray player anymore. No audio or video. Save yourself the hassle and spend another couple of dollars!
2,Not great!,This broke after a few months of me using it. It's a very cheaply made product and there are much better ones for only a few bucks more.
3,HDMI Cable,"Excellent buy for the price. Version 1.3 HDMI cable is very good for the novice, but more speed is needed for full 1080p."
5,HDMI Cables. More bang for your buck,The cables were delivered in a timely fashion. You cannot beat these cables for the price. They are every bit as good as cables costing upwards of fifty dollars.
3,good product for the price,"for a product priced a one tenth of the normal price, it is quite ok. i would recommend it as good valued item. The seller has made a prompt delivery too."
1,causes glitches in function of cable box,"This is the 2nd time i ordered this product. the first one broke right away, but i thought it was my fault because it got yanked out. The second one is working, but causes the cable picture to flash of for a second or two once in a while and some other little glitches. You get what you pay for i guess"
3,good price,"so far, so good.I expected copper tipped ,but I guess that I expect too much for this competetive price. Yeh."
4,Hdim cable,"HDMI cable is something I feel my cable company should provide, works well the price is good accidently double order, so I was sent 2 for about $5, pretty good deal."
2,50/50 chance!,I bought 2 of these cables a few months ago. The cables look well made. Performance was good and not good. One of the cables I got worked fine but the other cable was a dud. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! Thought I was getting a great deal here but I was wrong.
5,Cheap and It works great.,"DVI Gear HDMI Cable is a great cable. I have bought more expensive cables in the past thinking that they were worth the money. I have had zero problems with this cable. The quality compared to the more expensive cables is un-noticeable in my testing. Would I recommend this to my family and friends, Absolutely. One of my family members bought one, and they also have nothing but good things to say about it."
1,Junk cable,"The cable was junk, my component cables give a better picture. The sound pops and crackles as well making to distracting to be able to watch anything. Went to Best Buy and bought an expensive cable just to compare, it worked like a dream, returned those tho, to expensive to keep. I am sticking with my component cables for the time being."
3,Value for money !!.. we get is what we paid for !,The cable is good.. but i prefer to have a better insulated one.. if it is in use.. it will effect other wireless signals... like the Wireless TV receiver for getting channels.
5,HDMI CABLE,"This product is just like what is sold retail for upwards of $20.00. We purchased from our seller for $1.66. Shows how the stores really jack up prices. Amazon is the place to go for great deals. It works just perfect with our Roku. Such a great price we bought 2, so now we have an extra. Don't think you can go wrong on this product for the price."
1,Worst Idea ever.,"We ordered this cord before we went away on vacation. When we returned the cord was wrapped in some cheap black plastic bag, and not very well protected. The first night it was fine, then the next day it started having shortages and the following day we went to remove the cord and it broke off. All you can see now is wires. Cords for the dollar store last longer than this one. It was completely defective and I felt scammed. I shop on amazon a lot and this is was very disappointing. First bad item received."
3,Picture Quality Good - Sound quality SUCKS,"Not sure if its my specific wire or not, but some of the games that I try to play on my Xbox 360 have loud sounds that just get muffled and static-like through my TV (noticed it first when playing the first Portal, then again when playing Call of Duty: Black Ops). I never noticed them using the old Xbox's HD wires (green, blue, red, etc.) but plugged this wire in and started hearing A LOT of crappy static coming from the speakers. I cleaned and switched around the wire to see if that had any effect but its still staticy, so I'm going to switch some settings and go back to the old wire before I definitively decide if I want to get a new wire from somewhere else."
2,Ehhh,you get what you pay for hdmi cables are not of the highest quality their is some flickering when You start up your television
3,"Good, not sure how to distinguish the quality","Seems good enough. Main thing is that it reduces the clutter of having 5 wires. About quality of picture/sound...I'm not sure as I'm not into this technically...:-)Sure, the price was great."
2,Not a great cord,"When i hook this up to my blu ray player the picture goes in and out, we need to keep reconnecting it. buy another cord"
1,didn't last,"HDMI cable worked good for about a week. Then, I had audio but no picture. Pressed ""input"" button, picture returned. Only to fade out again in 2 minutes. Changed to another brand cable, problem solved."
5,Just as good!,"Why pay so much for HDMI cables when these are just fine.... I ordered around christmas so it wasn't exactly speedy delivery, but they came in great shape and work just fine."
5,Works Great. Cheap.,Products works great and can't beat the price. Using this between by gateway laptop that has hdmi out and my 28 inch LCD. Picture is much better than when I was running vga cables.
1,Awful,"This cable was completely worthless! When I plugged it in, half of the screen went all static-y. I was very disappointed."
5,Great Quality,"I was suprised at the great quality for such a low price! The item arrived quickly, I tested it out and was pleased with how well it works with my xbox. I was so pleased that I ordered two more for my boyfriend and roommate!"
5,Great Deal,This was a great deal. The hdmi cord works great and has improved picture quality tremendously. I would recommend this product to anyone who is buying an hdmi cord instead of paying way too much in the department stores.
3,Doesn't support 1080p,"For some reason this cable doesn't support 1080p from my PS3, it does support 720p though, so I was at least able to use it with my laptop and use the cable I used for my laptop with my PS3."
4,Cant beat the price,I was shocked to find these cables at a cost that is unheard of by any stretch of the imagination. They do the job and thats all I am concerned with esp in this economy.
5,Great cables for the price!,This cable is a much higher quality than expected for about $4 each. I picked up two of them to connect my PC and PS3 to a TV I just recently bought and they both look great in 1080p.Highly recommended.
4,Amazing for the Price,Bought this HDMI cable for my second TV. I was a bit skeptical given the price. But on using it I find it no different than the much more expensive HDMI cables.
1,POS Annoying Flicker,"Just like lots of other people are saying, this is a horrible cable and causes lots of flickering when I hook my laptop up to the TV. Get something else."
1,D.O.A (Dead on Arrival),"I ordered this hdmi cable, just to do a little experiment on the whole ""Hdmi mystery"". I wanted to compare this cheap cable to a high end cable, and see what the differences are, if there would be any... Well there was, this contestant was D.O.A... the cable didn't even work. hah. Guess that shows me the results the easy way. I am not flaming here, just simply posting my experience with this cable/company."
4,"NO Need to Over pay for HDMI cables, for a basic set up..","I order two cables, just got a PS3 mostly for the Blu Ray movies. The cables work great!No need to pay Over $100 for cables. Just be clean with your set up and no problems."
5,Priceless,So i ordered this item for my new tv and its a great lengthand workss like a charm. also the price was great
1,Does not work with 3d blu-ray,"I have a panasonic tc-p55vt30 tv and a panasonic 210 blu-ray player. I also have 2 of these cables and neither cable works with the player and tv when playing 3d blu-ray movies. I also have issues with regular blu-ray movies. I tried a Rocketfish cable and it worked. It's irritating to read from Cnet that the cable doesn't matter. If someone has an inexpensive recommendation for a cable, that would be great."
5,I'm using it as this is being written,"It's perfect! Arrived in a timely fashion, and works very well. I feel this to have been a worthwhile purchase."
3,This was OK - But wont recommend!,"This product was cheap (price), it was delivered on time but this wire has a physical damage. it had burn (heat) damage at 2 spots."
1,inferior quality cable,Stay away from this piece of junk product. It did not work with properly with any of my HDMI devices and it caused video distortion problems and intermittent loss of video sync.
3,Not good with Panasonic Plasma,"I bought 2 of them for my 2 HD TVs. It works fine with my new JVC HD-70FN97; but not good at all with my 2-year old Panasonic TH-42PX600U -- the colors on screen are obviously washed out. Not sure why, but I have to switch back to my component cable on the Panosonic TV."
1,Doesn't work,Purchased 2 DVI Gear HDMI cables from Cmple.com and both didn't work our of the box. 1 cable was completely dead and another one has a flcikering problem. Waste of money.
2,"very,very cheaply made",for the price i cant complain but this HDMI cable is the cheapest cable i have ever purchased..be prepared to buy supper glue because the plastic casings in the 2 inputs are very loose almost to fall out.other than that this cable works.....
1,Won't work,"I bought this product because I had a PC and Cable box I wanted to connect to my extra TV and this item was cheap. Unfortunately out of the box, this item did no live up to expectation.When I connect the cable box or PC to the TV, I lose audio and video every 3 to 5 minutes which is really frustrating when you're watching a movie. This lasts for about 10 seconds and it comes back on again.I've tried 4 other HDMI cables I use with my other TVs on this on this connection and they work perfectly.I guess you get what you pay for. No wonder it was so cheap."
1,Simply did not work,"When I replaced two other functioning cables between a satellite box and Samsung TV with this one, I lost the signal."
5,Much Better Than OverPriced Store Cables,"These cables are MUCH cheaper then the horribly overpriced Monster cables and they work just fine. My PS3 looks great using these HDMI cables to my Panasonic 42"" Plasma TV."
4,HDMI 2M (6 Feet) Super High Resolution Cable by DVI Gear,"Great deal on this cable. does all it needs to do.. only thing, didnt come in a package, just a yellow envelope. but all and all, a good product!"
2,reluctant negative review,"Philosophically I support this product. I've had good experience with generic cables in the past, and for digital cables like this one (which usually gets good marks) one would expect it to work.But in my case (with an HDTV and DVD player) I got no audio and an error message that the DVD player said the HDTV was not HDCP-compliant. I googled the precise error message, and found that it is almost always associated with bad cables.Rather than spend $25 at Radio Shack for a second cable, I hooked up the DVD player with some spare component video and audio cables that I had lying around. Maybe I'll try HDMI again another time."
1,Defective Cable- Don't buy,"This cable was defective right out of the box. The TV picture flashed and display was 'white/snowy'. It was immediately replaced by another new HDMI cable, problem solved. The defective cable later tried again- the bad picture was again seen. Don't buy this cable."
5,Do yourself a favor and just buy it.,"I will keep this one short and simple. It works, its cheap, so just buy the cable. I got three of them and they all work great."
5,Great product for the money,"I am not sure how HDMI cables are supposed to like when connected to my HD TV, but as far as I can tell this product is awesome for the money, I have no complaints"
3,kinda works,"I received the item, I am using with a recommended adapter for my mac to a samsung TV and both came with NO instructions, so I just plugged into my Mac book and to the tv, and all that displays is STANDARD mac desktop (not what's on my desktop) and pictures (blurry) but not in the order that they play on my laptop. Perhaps I need to do something on my end, but I am not happy with product thus far."
1,Don't Buy if you want High Speed HDMI,"This is a Category 1 cable, i.e., it only supports standard HDMI (720P) and is what Comcast provides with its HDMI cable boxes. Spend $10 and get a Cat 2 (High Speed) 1.4a cable. It's well worth the investment."
2,Good cable for price,"This cable supports 1080p at 60hz nothing more, will not do the job for me cause i have a 240hz tv, besides that it is a fine cable"
1,Didn't even work,"I bought this to hook my computer to my TV with. I recieved no picture, so naturally I assumed that either my computers HDMI slot didn't work or I was doing it wrong. So I kept it until I got a PS3. Than I tried again. Still got nothing. Now I was worried my TV didn't work. So I went to Fred Meyers and spent 20 dollars on a new one. Guess what, everything works, except apparently this cheap cable..."
1,Get what you pay for,"Yes! For the price of a pack of gum you too can have a faulty hdmi cord in only two business days! This is the second time i bought this cord, it only lasted a week both times. I would advise future buyers to look at other hdmi cables before you waste the dollar(plus 4-$5.00 shipping?) on this one; you will be disappointed."
1,Poor quality!,"Ordered 2 of these cables. After receiving them I hooked up my new Marantz AV receiver to my Samsung Blu-Ray and Samsung LCD TV. I could not display any signal other than the low resolution menu from my receiver. I borrowed a low cost HDMI cable from a friend and it worked fine. I contacted the seller and was sent 2 more cables. Again, both were useless. I am still waiting for a refund at this point."
3,Surprisingly it works,I was not sure that those cheap cables will work at all but got a nice picture and sound. Did not compare them side by side with gold plated $50+ cables but think that for my standard DVD I do not need anything more expensive.
3,The bare minimum,"This product has to be one of the cheapest HDMI cables available; and it shows when you look at the product. The cable is insanely thin, and does not look very well protected. The plugs work, but they do not have any grips on them, so they are rather difficult to get out. They look nothing like the picture. This cable clearly can't stand up to very much. Behind a tv, where it will not be disturbed more than once a year, it will do just fine. However, in an application that requires content flexing, plugging, and unplugging, this cord will suffer. There were no problems with picture or sound quality, and the Ethernet feature functions fine."
5,Great for the price!,"As far as I can tell this HDMI cable does just as well as any more expensive cable. I am not a TV expert, but I don't think this will be a waste of your money."
5,Best value product,"I've looked around for HDMI cable. Even Wal-Mart sells these cables for $35. When I looked at the price of this product, I was skeptical. I bought it for $1.09. Now it drops to $0.90. The quality of the cables is top-notch and it doesn't look like it for the price. Used it immediately and the quality of the picture looks really good, even have the cables running through a switcher. Definitely recommend it."
1,hdmi cable did not work at all,my hdmi cable did not work at all. It looked fine but couldn't display content on the screen. i just recycled it. What a bummer.
5,Simple: It works!,"This cable is just as described, it's affordable and it works fine. Can't beat the bang for your buck. I use it for my blu-ray DVD player and it simple works great. Not much to write other than it rocks."
3,seems cheaply made compared to others in same price range.,"I bought two other HDMI cables for under 3 dollars from different companys in the last 6 months. Both look thicker and seem like they are better constructed. Quality doesnt seem any different so far, but im wondering if that will change over a period of time... I guess for the price you really dont have much to lose. but because its so much thinner than my other HDMI cables i feel like its not going to last as long... bad first impression? the last cable i bought is only 10 cents more and i feel more comfortable with that one because it has gold ends and is thicker. but i really cant say anything bad about the quality yet. It looked fine when i tested it... i just have a funny feeling."
1,They didn't work,"I was rather pleasantly surprised by the amount of glowing comments that said these HDMI cables were just as good as the expensive ones. So naturally I ignored the several negative comments that said to ""watch out"" and ""you get what you pay for"" and ""these things are garbage"".Well, the joke was on me, I suppose, as you really do get what you pay for. I bought two of these. One never worked at all and the other one stopped functioning within three or so days. Shame on you cheap HDMI company, shame on you. Now, granted, I still don't think you should have to pay 40 some odd dollars for an HDMI cable - but I guess 1.99 was a little too good to be true."
5,Don't Fall Into the Best Buy Trap!,"I ordered 6 of these to have around for each time when I need a new cord. Rather than being tempted to pay some ungodly overpriced amount at any store nearby, I go into my electronics area and pull one out.Not much to be said here. I have store bought expensive HDMI cables and these. Maybe my eyesight is not up to par, but I can not tell any difference in terms of picture or construction quality. The only difference for me was the price.Based on this, I would definitely recommend these cords and give my stamp of approval to them. If you are on the fence, do some google searches and you will see that the expensive cords by Monster are outlandish and these will accomplish the exact same thing."
5,Cheap and just works!,Why spend a ton of money when a cheap $2 cable does the same thing? You can't wrong with this product at all. It runs at 1080p and 1080i with no problems.
3,"Fine, but you get what you pay for","I've bought a number of these over the years and for the low price I have no complaints. However, I have had two problems with two separate connectors.The first was a situation with a new cable right 'out of the box' - the 1080P signal was obviously degraded with strange flashing thin black lines that were visible only when a solid color background menu was on the TV (e.g. the DirecTV menu). After wiggling the cable and replugging it in a few times, the problem was solved and hasn't reappeared after ~ several months. The second was a cable that seemingly just died after about a year of use.I'm not about to advocate spending $50 on a 6' HDMI cable, and I still buy these for default applications, but realize that there is something to be said for not buying the very cheapest option out there."
3,Cables were GREAT,These worked just great and were much cheaper than the ones we saw at Best Buy and Office Max. They were ordered the same time as our Blu Ray Player so it was nice to get everything in one box all at one time.
1,Weak,HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet)This cable was very cheap and inexpensive but in my opinion it is not worth it. It broke and I now have to purchase another one. I would suggest getting it if you only want a cheap fix but not if you wish to have a product that will last you longer.
1,What's the problem??,"It's not working well.When I used first time,There were some strange stripes,and video quality was very low,so I could not use it long time.I'll threw it wastebasket.........."
1,You get what you pay for,"This cable was DOA. There was a reason why it was so inexpensive. Tried to use it on a new tv I purchased and no sound was produced and video signal was intermittent. Swapped out the cable with one from my DVD player and signal was perfect. Compared the two cables and this cheap cable was 1/3 as thick as the one from my DVD. If you are considering this cable, DON'T !!!"
1,HDMI cable,"Couldn't resist the price; however, the cable didn't work for the application for which I bought it (hooking up computer to LCD TV)."
2,Not a very good cable.,I know I only paid a buck and change for the item but when I used the cable the quality of the picture was very fuzzy and kind of dark. I don't know why but it was. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Just what I needed for a decent price,HDMI cables are the biggest racket. This cable probably cost less than a dollar for some company to make and the same cable would cost $20-50 at Walmart or radio shack. It was nice to be able to get one mailed to me for only $2 and I haven't had any problems with it.
3,Good Company,"This company is a good one after all, I had a price problem and they immediately correct the situation. My hat's off to this one, thank you."
5,no need to spend more $,make sure you measure how far you need to plug into your hdmi ports. these are greate esp for the price. ive gone to multiple stores and done my research on the gold cables and monster cables that cost over 100$. in my opinion there is not much difference in picture quality. these do the job and have not over heated nor have they caused any problems.
4,Works wonderfully,It does what it advertises. It is thinner than another cable I purchased from BlueRigger but sometimes thats a benefit. Solid choice for an inexpensive product. Great buy.
5,Good product,Good product. this item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
3,Cheap Cables,"I guess you really do get what you pay for. I got 4 of these. One was bad right away. I figured, for the price, why bother... Six months or so later another went bad. Eventually they all went bad but it took a year for the other two. The bottom line is, buying these cheap cables once a year is still much less expensive than dropping $20-$40 or more on cables in the store. Its up to you if you wanna save some money or save some trouble."
3,unable to rate this product,"I purchased this product because i wanted to attach my blue ray player to my tv.Unfortunately, my tv was not a high defintion tv and therefore i was unable to accomplish that.I have held on to the hdmi cable for the time when i buy a high defination tv and repurchase the blue ray player(which i returned)."
1,Horrible,"This HDMI cable didn't work at all :[ I used it for my ps3, and I have purchased these cheaper HDMI cables from Amazon before, and both have worked perfectly. I must have just gotten a defective one. Feels bad man."
1,REALLY CHEAP,"when cables arrived, one of them was actually broken, but I fixed it. go for a beter quality cable, you get what you pay for."
1,A cable that can used like as a 2ft rope,I bought this for $1.76 with free shipping to connect my TV to Xbox. It does not work at all! Waste of money. dont be fooled by its price..
2,Item is not gold-plated,"We received this item quickly, and its amazing to find an HDMI cable for under $3, but it is not gold-plated. I am not sure what other features it could be missing from the description since I have no intention of tearing it apart. So far the cable appears to be functional (have only used once on an XBox 360 connection), but I don't feel I have really tested this product. Just thought buyers should be aware that the item pictured is not what you will receive."
5,Good Company,"""Perfect price for the quality. They are indeed working HDMI cables. However, they fit lose in the tv and the digital quality is that of component cables or coax cables. "" This is my opinion on these cables. I did not ask, but because I wasn't satisfied with the product, the company refunded my money. I'ld say theyre a real,legit company that actually cares about their customers(as well as their reviews lol)"
1,"Well, it WAS awesome.","The price alone is a steal. So, I bought two. One for the laptop and one for the PS3. The one I used for the laptop stopped working after two uses. And now, the one attached to the PS3 is shot, keeps flipping off and on, losing the screen for fifteen or so seconds. Sometimes it corrects itself, sometimes it doesn't. I tried all for HDMI outputs and they all seem to end up the same way. I'm going to go, you know, more expensive, or something with a lifetime warranty."
4,good quality for small price.,Works just as well as my brand name hdmi cable. Best investment under 5 bucks I can think to make.
5,Great Value for the Cost,I have no problems with this HDMI cable. I could spend $40 or more on a cord that does the same thing. I really like this cable.
4,Great for the price,"When I ordered this item it was only a dollar. I have used it and it works fine. I would never spend $50+ on an HDMI cable, and if I did I don't think I would notice the difference. I was able to use it with my projector at 1280x768 (I hope those are the right numbers).Bottom Line: It works, and is at an unbeatable price (with reasonable shipping too)."
2,Get what you pay for,"$1.63! How can you beat that price? That's what I thought too. Folks, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a really low-end hdmi cable to last you 30 days then this is the cable for you. But if you like quality and uninterrupted sound from your tv or stereo then go ahead and spend a few more dollars for something of higher quality. That is, of course, unless you like swapping cables every month (but then you'll have spent $20 in a year and still have a crummy cable). But, that price keeps me from giving only 1 star."
1,"Flickering when conntected to tv through u-verse box,","Flickering when conntected to tv through u-verse box, also when connected to laptop i get a blamk grey screen what a waste of 5bucks since i bought three of em dont bother wasting your money on these"
4,Provides Clear Picture on TV,"This HDMI cord give a very clear picture on my tv. I have a very cheap tv which shown lines but with this cable, the pictures are very defined."
3,decent cable,prohdmi cable was decently long didn't notice difference between this cable and my friends $30 cable on speed and qualityconthe cable was abit skinny and looked as if it were easy to break or pull apart
2,50% Probability,"Purchased two cables: one in August 2011, the other in November 2011 respectively. One of them has not been connected to any supportable devices since this January. Like you, I did not adjust anything after installation. I found a review who are in the same situation below. If you need a reliable quality, please find another item with (at least) 1 year warranty. I will contact seller to ask how I can handle this problem and let you know who they are..."
4,best price HDMI !,this HDMI cable is just as good as the $50 cables sold in stores...I would buy again!
3,Not good one for HDMI-CEC purpose,"To use it as regular HDMI cable between components it is very good and for such a low price. This HDMI cable didnot support HDMI-CEC i.e. similar products sync power-on/off feature using single remote. For eg. HDMI-CEC is having power on/off feature from single remote to TV, Home Theater and Blue Ray player. And also this is not good cable if you want to hide it behind the wall as it is not good insulated enough. Less thickness implies more loss of transmission which will reduce the quality of video and audio."
2,Don't Listen to Cnet.com!,"I bought these out of CNET's recommendation and I don't know what happened but the plastic casing that ""protects"" the gold tip broke quite easily while I wasn't using my tv. Lasted less than 2 or three months. I guess it was ""You get what you paid for."" kind of thing. My advice: make sure the HDMI cable you buy has a metal casing like the Monsters that replaced them. It's still an annoying fact that I wasted money instead of saving money . . ."
4,Why pay more?,"Product works just fine, arrived as advertised, when advertised... for 1/10th of the in-store cost. I ordered an extra just to have on-hand, great purchase!"
1,get what you pay for,"This looked like a great deal and it arrived promptly but it does NOT work. The images were very poor quality. Went back to the red, blue, green cables."
5,Top Quality,"THis is is an excellent deal - if you need an hdmi cable, do not waste your time on the expensive best buy products. get this."
3,"Gets the job done, but not the best picture","perhaps its because mine wasnt exactly made by ""dvi gear"", but it was ordered thru this same page. the hdmi cable received is made by ""eltop electronics.""equipment used: samsung 5054 plasma & toshiba a2 hd player.i was hoping to replace my $30 phillips cable with this $6 (total w/shipping)cable; but comparisons between the 2 cables viewing tmnt hd in 720p showed a higher sensitivity to noise in darker colors and posterization in gradients using this cheaper priced cable.initially, using the phillips cable, i noticed some slight posterization/false contouring in the gray skys and clouds shown in tmnt (ninja turtles cgi movie). switching out to the eltop cable only enhanced those imperfectionsusing the phillips cable w/ my brightness at 51, there was no noise on the black letter box bars, with the eltop cable, brightness had to be turned down to 45 to compensate.but yes, for 6 bux it does gets the job done."
3,Gets the job done.,"While this cable has golden contacts and is thick with a sturdy design, and picture quality shouldn't be a concern because it is a digital signal and HDMI is heavily regulated for picture quality, there is quite a lot of drop-out resulting in total audio and video failure, especially when the resolution changes. Since I use this cable on a PS3 connected to a 1080p TV, and few games support 1080p, this is a real problem as the PS3 naturally tries to ajust to the best picture quality possible, flipping back and forth from game to game (or blu-ray movie.) The only solutions to the drop-outs are 1)completely unplugging and reconnecting the plug, or 2)turning the tv off and on."
1,Doesnt work,"I bought this cable thinking it would work for my Home theater system but when I hooked it up and attempted to play a DVD, there were green vertical lines all over the screen. I know it isn't my DVD player bc it works fine with component cables."
1,Not DVI Gear and Not 1.3 Certified,"Bought 2 cables and neither worked in 2 different new LCD TV's. I contacted DVI Gear directly only to find out that they do not make these cables (DVI Gear cables are blue) and all their cables are 1.3 certified. If your TV requires 1.3 certified HDMI cables, don't buy these. They won't work."
1,Inconsistent quality,"I received the HDMI cable and hooked up on a 1080p HDTV. Video okay but audio was intermittent. The seller readily sent a new HDMI cable and it now works to 1080i quality considering its price.I rated a 1-star originally and now I am upgrading it to 4-star for good customer support and prompt shipping. Unfortunately, I can only edit my review but not the star rating."
5,BUY CABLES ONLINE!!!,"I bought a HDMI cable at KMART for $60. Then I saw this one. I used the KMART one until this came, then used this one. There is NO difference in video or audio quality. I got my $60 back from KMART. Please buy all cables online. The price in stores is not reasonable."
4,Great for its price,Have bought this HDMI cable before and was satisfied with it. The new one has worked well so far. No issues.
5,HDMI Cable,"Cheap, works perfectly, ships in a reasonable amount of time. You can't argue with a good deal."
4,Good Value,"I'm glad I did not fork over 75 bucks for name brand cables.I used these cables to connect my Sony upconvert dvd player,and cable box. I got a fantastic picture from my dvd player, and a blotchy picture from my cable box.I would recommend buying a set of component cables too, and experiment connecting your cable box to your tv.My Scientific Alanta cable box did not do a good job upconverting standard 480i analog signals as my Samsung 4041 lcd tv.Signals through hdmi connections usually do not get any signal processing on the tv,so before you return your tv,try component cables the results may be amazing."
5,"Great picture, great value","I have to admit I was skeptical when I found this cable given that it was so much cheaper than all the rest. After reading the reviews, I decided to go ahead and try it out--after all, it was a small investment. I am very glad I decided to go ahead and buy this cable. The picture quality is great without having spent 3 to 4 times as much."
1,There must be a difference!,"Unfortunately these cables did not work Christmas morning on our new PS3. Our TV said no HDMI signal detected. We had to wait until the 26th to go out a buy a much more expensive HDMI cable (I decided to go ahead and get Sony's)and it worked immediately. I know there isn't supposed to be a difference - but I probably will not risk it again - esp for Christmas morning. I was very disappointed.(the seller as offered to replace - so we'll see if these work).Jan 1, 2008 - the seller did replace these cables and the new cables worked on the first try just as well as my more expensive cable. But I would be cautious buying these again because judging from the reviews, the quality of these cables are not consistent."
1,HDMI cable is crap,"This cable keeps coming lose in the back of my TV. I have to move it around just to get it to work. It doesn't matter how inexpensive it is, it's not worth it."
2,"Cheap cable, does not work well with PS3","The cable I received does not match the picture; the connectors are much smaller. I'm returning this cable today. I used this cable to connect my PlayStation 3 to my 2009 LG-brand television. There was a constant, annoying flicker present both when viewing Blu-Ray movies at 1080p and when playing games at 720p. I replaced the cable with another one that I have, a thicker cable with larger connectors, and the flicker went away. I suspect (as other reviewers have also pointed out) that this is a Category 1 cable (rather than the more expensive Category 2 type), but it couldn't provide basic picture quality at 720p as Category 1 is supposed to do."
1,It doesn't work,"First I bought one from a local store, but then I decided to buy one online for cheaper, so I decided to go for this one, but it doesn't work. When I connect it it takes like three seconds in the ""retrieving signal"" mode then it just does nothing. I thought it was a problem with my tv or my computer but when I plug in the other HDMI cable it works fine."
3,Surprise,"Not what I was expecting. I ordered an external hard drive and this was listed as ""Frequently Bought Together"". Upon arrival I was surprised to find the cable does not work with the hard drive."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!! DO NOT BUY,"I bought two of these cables for my home theater setup. When they arrived, they looked nothing like the picture. The cable is REALLY small and thin USB style that you would expect to see going to a webcam. After using the cable and seeing a terrible picture (purple shifting screen and bad resolution) I was concerned something was wrong with my blu ray player. Swapped the cable out with my $14 hdmi cable I bought from best buy and the picture was wonderful. These cables SUCK!!!!"
2,Worth what you pay for it.,Description of what you are buying:-6ft HDMI Cable-Works perfectly-Breaks REALLY easily-Transfers good sound and picture-Breaks REAAAAALLLY easily
4,Does not work with Roku Digital Video Player,"I purchased 4 of these HDMI cables because of the price. Usually, inexpensive cables do not affect performance, not; however with the Roku Digital Video Player. When I connected the Roku to my new Vizio television a no signal message was displayed with 2 of the 4 cables.The cables were replaced with WireLogic HDTV KIT (Costco 2/$30) and there was an immediate recognition between the television and the Roku.To be fair, these cables were only tried with the Roku player. I will revise my review if these cables work with other hardware.Update: Upgraded star rating from one to four. These cables worked well connecting my television to a DVD and a laptop. Prehaps the sheilding on the Gear cable is not strong enough for the Roku."
1,hdmi cable,"this hdmi cable did not work, the volume on my new tv would randomly go up and downwhen watching hd channels, went to walmart, bought a new cable and it fixed the problem"
1,does not work,"Got two 6 foot cables, one for xbox, one for blu-ray. Both cables work with xbox. Both cables produce scrambled picture on blu-ray. Purchased these to replace 3' cables I had been using that were too short for moving players around. Went back to 3' cable and blu-ray works great. Garbage."
4,Great Deal,4 HDMI cables for under 14 bucks. Most of the cost was for shipping.They work as intended and are so inexpensive !
3,Its just ok,Theres a reason i only had to pay 3 cents. But i can't complain it works and if you really need a cable than its ok. It is not a thick cord at all i was a little thrown off. i also own a 30 dollar hdmi cable and i do notice a difference in quality
5,Price is right,"This cable does what it's supposed to do and hooked up just fine from my blu-ray to my TV. The picture is crisp with this cable, and the price is great. I'm glad I didn't splurge on an expensive cable."
1,Video cuts out!,When using this cord the audio and video from any of my devices cuts in and out. When I swap to one of my other HDMI cords (blue rigger) there are never any problems. Spend the extra few bucks get a quality item.
1,piece of............,"If you want to buy a cheap cable that will blink out and in every other minute this is it. You can be watching TV and it just loses its signal goes blank right in the important parts. That's not all in a action part it will pixilate or breaks up badly, this is a piece of .................................."
5,HDMI Cables,"Excellent value for money. The only thing is I wish the shipping costs were less. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this item and the seller."
3,adequate,"As a ""second"" cable, this product is adequate. It is not a top flight product, but of course it is not priced as one. Its primary use is for those instances when we are hooking something up for temporary usage. For this purpose, it does very well."
4,good price-great service,when i ordered my cable i was impressed with the price-the cable was as advertised and works great-the local cables were four times the cost-the service was great and it was delivered promptly-i was kept involved in the whole process-i strongly recommend this product-chris
1,Didn't work.,"Based on the reviews here, you'll order it and odds are it will work just fine. Mine got here and it doesn't work. I'm glad it was only $5 but I won't try again."
4,"good hdmi, but not as reliable using 1080p full hd","This cable is very good, It is a digital signal, so there is little to no loss of signal. However, it does not have higher bandwidth to support full 1080p. So it isn't that reliable trying to display 1080p at 60 hz or higher images on the TV. Don't get me wrong, it does display 1080p images. You can play Blue ray disk at 1080p at 24 Hz with little to no problems. But if you want to play games or display images of 60 Hz or higher, This cable may not be right for you. The screen flickers and turns blank for a while and sometime come back on, but it is not as stable as 1.3v hdmi versions. For people with low-end HD TVs that has a HDMI, or TV that doesn't need full 60hz or high refresh rate, This cable would do the job. If you want to play Games on you PS3 with FULL HD 1080p at 60 hz or higher, you probably need a newer version cable."
1,Bad cable,"Bad cable, Price should have told me you get what you pay for. Tried two different items, my TV and DVD player would not work on either."
1,quit working after a few months,"I concur with other posters, this HDMI cable quit working after a few months. Had audio, but the video was completely scrambled. Double checked connections, and if cable was ""wiggled"" just right, the picture would come back. Replaced with another HDMI cable and things work just fine now. In this case, you DO get what you pay for."
5,HDMI,Great product for the money. Saves the hassle of RCA cables and other wiring. Gold connectors bring out the audio and visual aspects of the movies.
4,Good HDMI cable for PS3,"I use this cable for my PS3 connected to a Samsung 6 Series LCD TV. I don't have any complaints. Video quality is superb, and best of all it was CHEAP!"
4,hdmi cable,This cable is good and have excellent performance while connecting to computer and external display. It can be connected to the modem and TV or anywhere hdmi cable required.
5,"Great, simple HDMI cable","PROS:-It's simple, it works on my PC and PS3, and it's two and half bucks. It even comes with covers on each end.CONS:-None that come to mind."
5,HDMI Cables,"After looking at the prices of HDMI cables at Best Buy ($80- $120)I decided to look on line. A review on CNET indicated there really wasn't any difference between cheap and expensive cables for digital applications. I got mine from Eforcity on Amazon and they are great. I don't understand how they can be so cheap but they work just fine. Someone must be really ripping off the public with their high prices. I personally like Best Buy, but get real! Anyway, great product, great price and delivered as described. I have used Eforcity twice since this order."
5,Good Price,You can't beat the price. Why pay quite possibly 10x more at a big box store when you can buy one here for so much less?
1,poor connection,"Poor connection, no signal. I do not advise buying this product. I am going to spend a little more money to ensure a better cable."
3,DVI Gear HDMI Cable 2M 6 feet,"It showed this being purchased with the Toshiba DVD/VCR Recorder so I added it to my cart, not thinking at the time that I didn't need it because it is not a Blue Ray! I ordered it erroneously!"
1,feels like something you buy from a local 99 cent store!,bought three of these thinking that it would be a great deal with all the positive reviews but the wire is low guage and I do not think that this product has all the attributes that the seller claims. this hdmi wire feels like something you would buy from a local 99 cent store. I paid like $3 for each cable but I think that it is worth paying an extra $2-3 for another better quality cable from amazon. I installed this on my HD cable box and it seems to work but the wire feels really flimsy and probably has no type of shielding. you get what you pay for!
4,Decent cable,Great Value for the price. I use it to connect my hp laptop to my lcd and havnt had any issues
2,Cable failed after ~10 months of use,"I purchased this cable for use with my PS3. It functioned properly (i.e., output video and audio) for about 6 months. At that point, about four months ago, the cable would require increasing amounts of poking and prodding to successfully transmit data. So, in the beginning, if I tapped the connection point at the back of the PS3, it would work. Then, I had to wiggle the cable more until it would work. Finally, no amount of wiggling (or disconnecting/reconnecting, swapping cable connections) would work.I replaced the cable and things worked perfectly, which leads me to conclude that something in the cable simply failed after about 10 months of usage. Here, 'usage' means 'sitting still at all times connecting console and TV'. So, I'm not impressed by this particular cable, and will not purchase it again.That said, buying a $3 cable every ten months is a much better proposition than buying one Monster cable for hundreds of dollars."
1,Stopped working after a month,I bought this cable and it worked fine at first but after a while it started giving a shoddy signal. White specs would appear all over my screen and I would have to adjust the cable until they went away. Most of the time I would get no picture at all. I treat my electronics with care so it most likely wasn't my fault. Perhaps I just got a poorly constructed cable. Remember that you're taking that risk when you buy this extremely cheap cable.
1,Don't bother,"Bought this cable to connect my cable box to my Toshiba HD TV. Worked fine at first but I was having to reboot my cable box every morning, sometimes twice a day. Had the cable company out for a couple of service calls, replaced the cable box 3 times, no change. Unplugged the HDMI cable and everything is back to normal again. Only cost $3 so I'm just going to chalk this up to a learning experience. Ya gets what ya pays for."
5,"Quality, Quality, Quality","I could not believe it could get better, then I connected the HDMI cable and transformed my HDTV experience right through the roof. The miracles of technology. Thank you soo much."
5,Amazing! it works perfect and presents a beautiful picture and sound!,i pluged it in the second i got it and everything worked with a crystal clear view. the sound was crystal clear aswell. i would recemmend this to anyone!
5,Inexpensive but work great,"I bought these cables through Amazon. After seeing what seemed to be astronomical prices for HDMI cables at the big box applicance stores, and doing research that said never, never, pay more that $10.00 for a HDMI cable, I gave it a shot. I bought five for the price I would have paid for one at one of those big box stores, and they work just great. Save your money - buy these HDMI cables through Amazon."
5,Why Pay More,I bought this cable as my second HDMI cable. The other is a monster cable that I spent over $50 for. There is no difference in quality and this cable is just as long.
4,Pretty Awesome,It's just plain out awesome. It's very cheap and the graphics are crazy!!! I got this for ps3 cuz I was like broke and have been shocked with it's awesomeness. I just wish this was a Category 2 cable instead.
4,This item is fine,This item does the job just fine and the cost was great. I recommend this product to everyone.
5,Perfect,This product arrived in perfect condition and works like a charm. I was a little surprised because these cords can cost a fortune but this works perfect for me.
5,Why pay more?,"I'm sure if you're looking up prices for HDMI cables on the internet, you already know that brick and mortar stores are reaming you with their $15-100 price tag. Get five of these, use however many you need, and put a couple in the closet. HDMI is becoming popular and it's good to have backup cables."
5,Perfect for short distance connections,"It works perfectly fine and is able to stream audio/video at 1080p @60Hz flawlessly. This is what it is supposed to do, right? For this price it is a steal. No need to go for the $100+ monster cable. You get the finest of details with this.UPDATE 10/03/2010: I bought another one of these to connect my PS3. I should say this...it's the best value for money you can get for an HDMI cable. My old one is still working after over 18 months of use and the new one works well enough for gaming on PS3...no issues at all.So...DO NOT buy those expensive ones until you want to conceal the wiring in a conduit. Those more sturdy and expensive ones do not have a lot of signal improvement over 6 feet distance but they do when you have 25/50 feet or even longer wiring to use."
1,Very Poor Quality,I do not recommend this product - purchased 6 cables and all 6 of them result in green static on plasma screen.
1,Defective Product,"I have always believed HDMI cables were all the same, but not true!! I just bought three 6 foot cables from Cmple and all three are cheap Chinese junk. Connecting to my DVD player and doing an A/B test with a good cable, all three failed. The first cable provided video and audio but excessive noise snow on the screen. The next two cables not only had noise but scrambled yellow and greeen horizontal bars, no video or audio. I compared all 3 through the same ports and setup against an inexpensive cable I knew to be good and determined the new HDMI cables were all defective.I am still of the belief that as long as the cable will carry a signal and not pick up interference you should not pay excessive ampounts for HDMI. Always had good experiences with other brands of cheap cables but these products don't work and for $1.77 each they are hardly worth the return postage!!!"
1,"Thought it was good, but doesn't work","After a few months, started to flicker with this cable. Cleaned and used on other devices and same thing. Changed cable and works fine.Don't buy this cheap cable."
4,They Work!,"I needed a HDMI cable to connect my LED screen to my Dell laptop. This cable cost me less than $2 and it works fine. I like the picture on my 1080p LED screen. I do not know what's the difference between these $2 cables and those that cost $40, $50 dollars. But I don't have a problem with the quality this cable gives."
5,BUY THIS,Don't be fooled by the people at bestbuy. This cable is just as good if not better than those 80 dollar ones. There is no need to waste money! Buy this cable!
1,Not quite up to par.,"i ordered two of these cables thinking well it'll only be four dollars so why not, you definitely get what you pay for because these things are garbage, unless your using them purely to display slide shows then you wont have any use for them..."
1,Not Necessary,Why was this recommended? It did not even fit into the Phillips Home Theater System it was recommended for.
2,Average HDMI,"If you are using an average HD system, its ok but if are willing to spend on high end system. This is not the cable for you. I got my cable fast but tried to use this cable compare to a standard cable by Sony. You will notice difference thru picture and especially sound wise. I am using Pioneer Elite Receiver with 1.3 upscale and a pioneer elite blue ray. This does not meet my expectation."
2,"It's cheap for a reason, people!!!!","I am going to be as honest and straight-forward as I can. I would LOVE to tell you that this cable is perfect, and as reliable as the expensive ones... but the old saying is true: You get what you pay for.This cable worked fine (not amazingly, just fine) for 4 days. It was not noticeably better than component - I switched back and forth and could not tell a difference in picture or audio.However, after 4 days, the audio started to cut out every few seconds. It became unwatchable. Component worked fine, so it was clearly the HDMI cable.SUMMARY: The cable was AS GOOD AS component (NEVER better) for 4 days, then stopped working properly.Beware."
2,I am the only dummy out there,"I bought this product based on the reviews. I have a 60"" Sony HDTV LCD with an HDMI connection and a brand new Sony upscaling DVD player. I thought I just needed to plug it in on both ends, and it would work.It didn't. Nothing works, no video, no audio. Not sure what you can do wrong with one cable and one way to plug it in on each item."
2,Don't waste your money.,"The point is, you get what you pay for. Your standerd Three wire set up will work just as good. If you want real quality you will have to pay for it. I went with a Monster Cable."
2,cheap HDMI cable,"If you're looking for a quality HDMI cable this is not it, This cable did not compare to a known brand HDMI cable. the difference in the picture quality was very noticeable. I don't recommend this cable and the wires are also very thin, unlike the thicker wires that the more expenssive cables have"
1,Not for sony 1080p tvs,Please do not buy this cable if you own a high def sony tv because all you will get is a blank screen. Very poor cable for high def needs.
1,Not Reliable For Me,"I really wanted these to work, but they didn't consistently do so. I used one from my cable box into a Sony soundsystem, and then another one into my LG LED TV. Everything would play fine for a while and then, boom, ""No Signal"". I played around with different configurations. Sometimes they would work, other times, ""No Signal"". Since I have switched to the flat Vizio High Speed HDMI cables a few weeks ago, I haven't had ANY PROBLEMS with signal at all.I am using these cables between my DVD player and TV and my PS3 and the TV and they seem to work fine for those. But something about 1080/240 that these cables coudn't consistently handle."
2,not so satisfied,I got the cable on time but when I used it for my FIOS the screen kept getting blank after small intervals it felt like something was interfering in the tv picture i changed the cable and it turned out to be fine then. Not really satisfied with the product. Shipping was well before time.
5,Works fine,How can anybody complain when you pay so little for a cable that does exactly what it is suppose to at a fraction of the price that the major retail stores charge. You can pay more for the same cable too many other places - don't... there is no need to.
2,very poor quality,only good for basic hdmi needs. I only had one work. not worth the price. Get one at walmart for 6 bucks and quit being cheep like me.
5,HDMI Cables work GREAT!,"These cables, even with shipping, were almost half what they are in the store. They work every bit as good, also. Got (2) 6 foot HDMI cables to go between my auto switch, my sound bar, and my TV."
5,Awesome!!!,"it exceeded my expectation. Nice Cable. Though ""Made in China"" but its okay for a cheap HDMI cable. Worked perfectly."
2,Wondering Abt My 2nd HDMI,Got the product on time but i ordered two online and only got one in the mailso i was a little disappointed on the subject but wouldn't order more then one even though theirs a great deal you wouldn't get what u paid for.
5,Great deal,You won't find a better deal on HDMI cables these work just as good as my 40 dollar set wish I would have seen these a long time ago.
3,Not completely satisfied,"HDMI (2 meter) 6 foot cable HQ 1080P 1.3b by DVI Gear.I ordered the cable wire and a 26 inch TV.I received the TV, but never received the 6 foot CABLE HQ 1080.I am still waiting."
1,completely dead,I bought two of these cables to have spares.I needed to use them a few months later and find out they are both dead.I should have tested them as soon as I received them.
3,OK cable,OK cable for the price. But it could not handle 1080p from PS3 to my Shape 52inch 120Hz TV. Works fine at 720p.Had to upgrade to $10 cable I found in department store to get 1080p from PS3 to TV.
5,HDMI on the cheap...,"This item works just as good, but better, than the expensive gold tip cords sold at electronic retailers (I looking at you Best Buy). Why better, it works just as well but is almost 200% cheaper."
5,It works!,"For the life of me, I can't figure out why people would buy the same length HDMI cable for $40 at a big box retailer. This HDMI cable works just like any other I've used! No problems!"
1,"WRONG CABLE TO FIT ANY CASIO CAMERA, EXILIM EXS5",iT WAS THE WRONG CABLE TO FIT ANY CASIO EXLIM EXS5 CAMERA NOW i HAVE 2 THAT WOULD COS MORE TO SHIP BACE THAN THIER WORTH AND THE VENDO SAYS THIER NOT AVAIL. i WONT BUY AGAIN. mICHAEL EBERHARDT52@YAHOO.COM
2,seem to be fine,"HDMI cables seem fine, ordered two,one to connect my apple tv and a extra one to have on hand, cables are fine and price is good, compared to buying one at a local store, but don't be in a hurry to get anything ordered from this company, it takes forever.probably will not buy from this company again."
1,You get what you pay for,How can I buy a HDMI cable for three bucks when they cost over thirty at Wal-mart. By buying a piece of junk. The connectors have to be jiggled to get a connection and even then the slightest vibration causes a complete signal loss. It is so cheap that it is not even worth sending back.
5,Perfect fit,excellent product. Works just as great as a more expensive one I had bought prior. There are no reasons to pay more. I will purchance more as I switch over more of my vedio equipment.
4,Great HDMI cable for the price,"Don't be fooled by the 10x priced Monster cables this is the real deal. These cables produce amazing picture quality with my PS3 hooked up on my Samsung LNT4065F 40"" 1080p LCD HDTV. I don't see any reason to spend a bunch of money on cabling."
3,Good for the price and works,"I was skeptical if I am getting the right product but when i received the cables, they are decent and do their job. There is some video quality loss but nothing that you can notice and I have only tried with streaming video so far and not yet using a DVD type input or something on those lines."
1,defective cable,"I bought this cable to go with my new digital TV. After two days of tracing why my new TV would not work I discovered that this cable that I bought when I ordered it did NOT work at all! Not only was it defective, but I wasted about a day tracking the problem to the cable. Don't buy this one unless you want to run the risk of getting a defective one."
1,never received and no one call to check why,"Since is kind a free they dont care to send it to your address provided, so better do not advertise this item as a free shipping or at no cost is only a catch to sell they are not serious in what they advertise."
1,Do not buy this product,"Do not buy this product. I learned my lesson again...you get what you paid for...it's not the same as the other ""$50 cable"". It shows red lines and degrades picture over time."
1,Did not work for me,"I bought a new LG HDTV and hooked up the new HDMI cable to the cablebox but the signal was not recognized. When I used a different HDMI cable, it worked. Sorry - this HDMI was useless for me."
3,not bad,"For the price is not bad, it looks very simple but not very durable for experiments not bad theres other better"
4,great value!,"I bought a bunch of these for around the house, they all work excellent. I def bought more than I needed but for the price, why not!"
5,TOP NOTCH!,"My boyfriend recommended we get a HDMI cable to hook onto our PS3 for higher definition viewing on games, netflix, dvds, etc. He helped me order one through this seller, saying he got the exact same one from the exact same seller. I was a bit doubtful about the product at first. I mean, how much more can a blu-ray compatible system become even more enhanced in its definition on our HDTV? Anyway, the shipping was SUPER fast and the cable works like a charm. I instantly noticed how much clearer the images were on screen with a change in our cable to this one. Thanks for being a great seller!"
4,Does what it should,Works great. Does the job.only wish it were a bit longer I guess....I mean its an HDMI not much to say.
5,Great for Gaming,"I ordered this product to use with my X-Box 360. I was some what shocked by the price and thought ""you get what you pay for""....very surprised...product is great quality and my picture has NEVER looked better....if you want a great product with out having to pay for the large chain store price, look no further."
5,"Bought 2, Both work great!",I bought 2 of these cables and they seem to work just fine. Construction seems sturdy enough and they deliver a great picture from my laptop. watched a 3d movie with this cable and it was fantastic.
5,HDMI Cables,Item was exactly as described and works just fine. Sure beats the heck out of paying $30 or $40 for an HDMI cable. Would highly recommend this item to my friends and other potential buyers.
5,Work like a charm,"This is second time I bought this. They comes in a plastic bag but work well compare to other brand name which could cost you lot $$ more. Who cares about the fancy box, you would end up tossing it anyway. Highly recommend this product."
4,works like a charm,"its very good and it has not yet broke, so its best to buy one for yourself is you want HD picture"
2,Don't like that it resets each time i change the channel,"I hooked this cable up to my cable box and everytime i change the channel, it cuts out for 3-5 seconds and then comes back on. this is very annoying since I don't plan to stay on one channel the whole time. For the price i guess its nice, but i'd rather pay a few extra bucks for a good cable, not this lackluster one"
5,HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet),Worked like a charm. I am pleased with quality of the product and the price was nice. Similar products were in the $30.00 to $70.00 price range.
2,Low quality cable distorts picture,"I used this cable on my 60"" plasma TV and the picture had lots of white dots on it. The cable is too thin and the signal was probably distorted by the TV or other electronics around. Then I tried it on my 40"" TV in the bedroom, where there is no other electronic gadget other than the cable box, and it worked fine. I planned to return the cable, but I decided to keep it since I can use it to connect my laptop to TV when travelling. The cable is very light and that is the only advantage of it."
3,"Cheep, usufull, great, that's it.","Great product.Good price, I had problems receiving this produst, but a good Costumer service help me to solv the problem and I am a happy costumer in this product.I save money and I have the oportunity to purchase another items to live a great life.Thanks, that's it."
1,"The cables are very poor build quality, flickering picture","Stay away from these, get a higher quality cable. The BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable were fantastic, and only six bucks each. Or get the mediabridge ultra series for only ten dollars. Just stay away from this cheaply made junk."
5,good,this hdmi cable is really good and it was really cheap i didn't think it would work this good but it was better then most cables ive used
4,Suprised!,I thought I was making a mistake by buying a cheaper cable because I was told only the high end ones will work. NOT THE CASE! Its perfect and works great. Pleasantly surprised.
3,Good one,"Hi,This is a good product . Initially I faced a problem with shipping , and i was not able to receive the product on time, but when I informed the seller I got the product within 2 days of my call.The product is really nice and its a real value for the money."
4,awesome cables,"they got here fast and they work great!! I wanted them pretty quick, and I was surprised how fast they came, these HDMI cables work perfectly, great job"
4,great,It was cheap and works like a charm. thank you It is exactly what i was looking for to connect to my tv
5,Great buy,Timely delivery. . .plugged it in and it worked. . .saved $$$$'s. If you need any kind of component connector don't look anywhere else to buy.
5,excellent,"really great product I have no complaints, arrived in time indicated and appropriate to the product packaging have nice day"
5,Good cables,"Just right for the long distant connection between boxes. Good quality and value, they realy get the job done like I needed."
4,They work fine,An HDMI cable is an HDMI cable as far as I can tell. These cables have never failed in my use of a year or so.
2,broke,"this item broke on me after a few days of use, but it was only 2 dollars. it's worth the gamble.and dont let anyone tell you some BS about how some hdmi cables will give you a better signal or video quality than others. ITS DIGITAL, BINARY. ONES AND ZEROS. EITHER YOU GET THE SIGNAL OR YOU DON'T. BUY CHEAP CABLES."
5,Is as advertised,"As other reviewers have stated, don't pay more for ""premier"" products when it comes to HDMI cables. This one works as advertised and was under $4 bucks delivered. Not sure you could beat that with a garden hose! :-)"
5,Good HDMI Cable - Cheap too.,"This is exactly what I needed. I refuse to pay $40.00 or even higher for an HDMI cable, and this one was $3.10."
4,Good One,This cable is really good one and i got this product on time. I am using 2 HDMI cable one for bluray player and another for laptop and this is what i am expected.
4,Good buy,"For the price you can't go wrong , it is good buy for my hdmi devicesI encourage you to buy it"
1,Broke after a month of use,I used this product for about a month before it broke. Shoddy product - you get what you pay for with this cable I guess.
4,Good,Working awesome for me. But heard there are eve better options than this.. Please do some more research before buying..
5,"BUY THESE HDMI, I DID AND VERY SATISFIED!!",These cables do EXACTLY what the $50 & $75 cables do for a lot less cash. VERY satisfied and saved a boat load of cash with these. Nice product!
5,Priced to sell.. Works like a charm,"HDMI cables are too costly at brand stores. My first cable was a 4 feet one for 20$. I was recently suggested by a Sears salesman to buy a 9 feet cable for $35. But this one is priced great and arrived on time. Works great with my Olevia 32"" tv, Roku, Verizon fios and Lg bluray. I use a hdmi 3 to one switch."
4,Works well and was a great price,This cable did what I expected and the price was a fair price for the item. Couldn't find it at any local retailer for the same price so ordered online and saved money.
1,This cable does not even work,"I bought this cable to connect my laptop to a monitor. The laptop detected the monitor but no video signal was sent to the monitor. The monitor does not see the computer.It must be a pin that is not done right in the cable.Edit: The seller sent me a replacement cable. That one worked on my TV but not the monitor.Since then I bought a WireLogic cable and it worked flawlessly. This one is thicker than the cheap cable.The thin cable worked on some but failed on some more sensitive devices, I guess.I was sending 1080p signals, BTW."
4,Works just fine,"Plugged in my the HDMI cable into my LCD (780p) TV and my XBOX 360 and it works just fine. No issues whatsoever. They were so cheap that I bought a few more ""just in case"".I gave it a 4/5 only because there's nothing to ""love"". It's a cable."
5,Decent for the price,"It is a cheap hmdi cable, with decent prices for shipping. nothing wrong with the items, and are a great cheap addition to my tv setup, and one for the laptop bag just in case I want to put video out through hdmi. If for whatever reason I need more of them, I'll get these"
5,Best cable you can buy,"Simply put, this cable works perfectly, and the price can't be beaten. I got myself 3 of these babies."
3,Its works..... but not really hd,"Its an hdmi hook up but thats it. you have to understand its a $2 cable. i originally purchased it for my gaming pc with little expectations then once i hooked it up the color wasnt in depth also the refresh rate is really slow. and i dont believe it plays audio but not fully sure. now i use this as an extra cable it works but thats all, great buy for the money but so is regular video cables for you dvd player. long story short if you want an extra cable for your tv go for it. but this isnt made for a real hd source that puts out full hd"
5,awesome,I have been using it about 2 months and it works great. Picture is clear and crisp. This is really a great value and works just as well as the more expensive cables.
1,chincy,"the price was right but the cables were very cheap and chincy. My grandmother udsed to always say, ""Pay sh_t, get sh_T!"""
1,Pitiful quality,Quit working in less than 2 weeks and it was the cable because a new one of quality fixed the problem
1,Bought two... threw two out,"I bought two of these cables, one to connect a roku player to my tv, the other to connect a sony blu-ray player to another tv. Both cables have the annoying flicker that cuts in and out repeatedly so i basically understand 1/3 of everything that is said in a two hour movie... cheap is what you buy cheap is what you get.... oh well"
1,did not work for me,"Hooked up to a Blu Ray player. These cables did not work with my Blu Ray (picture froze). I am going to return them. I had good luck with the Amazon brand HDMI cables that are about $7-8 each. The ones that worked are:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052SCU8U/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_detailsUPDATE: the seller is willing to refund my purchase, but ONLY if I return the items with tracking #, which would be almost as expensive as the cables. I'd really recommend you save your money and do not risk buying these cables."
5,Great value Why spend more,"Most custom installers will tell you that HDMI cables all have minimum standards, so there is really no reason to pay high prices for so called high end cables. Spend your money on the components. These cable are great and are an even better price than big box store."
4,good service bad product,"i got the hdmi cable for 79 cents. it was delivered quickly, but it didn't work. the company has offered to refund my 79 cents, but i just threw away the cable. not worth the postage to return it. can't complain about the service or delivery or price, but the quality control stinks"
2,flaky,"Cable was unreliable. Often the video/audio would flicker, especially after my LCD TV warmed up. I suspected that the connector loosened as the unit expanded. I was able to prop the cable up to make the signal more stable, but in the end decided to bite the bullet on Christmas Eve and go to Radio Shack for a $30 cable."
1,"""High QUSLITY"" was on the bag - ACCURATE","I don't frequently rate products I've purchased on Amazon, so rest assured that I do so now only because this particular product is the definition of failure. While some may have had no problem using it, I suspected there may be a problem when I first opened the Amazon box.The wire was housed in a clear plastic bag that, as far as bags go, was dandy. The wire inside also looked fine, but one thing irked me: on the bag in big white letters, was printed ""HIGH QUSLITY HDMI CABLE.""""HIGH QUSLITY""""QUSLITY""I figured this was no big deal, just a typo. But when I plugged the cable in, it did nothing. I tested it on several devices and it never relayed a signal at all.I can't really say more than that - the cable simply didn't work. It didn't appear broken or bent or frayed, but no matter how high its quslity was, it failed to do the one thing it promised to do."
5,WOW! Don't pay $95.99 at Best Buy - this is the cable you need!,"I have a 56"" Toshiba HDTV, and recently got HD digital cable. I used Component video cables in the past, and relized I now had HDMI connection. My first stop was Best Buy, and found their 2-3 brands of cables, all running over $80!!! For a CABLE!? So I checked on Amazon, and found this one sold by Abacus24-7 for $6. I figured I would get what I paid for, and nothing too great, but it was worth a try before blowing $100 at the store. Got my cable in 3 days, hooked it up and WOW!! Color and clarity of picture is awesome, and the sound was fine (just as good as before) I can not imagine the picture being any better by buying a Monster cable or anything else for 15 times the price. I HAD to write a review because this is a great deal, and I realized those other high price cables with the fancy name and packaging are probably not worth the money. Great deal. great product, fast delivery and hassle free buying. Thank you."
5,Very good product for a penny. Wish they could combine shipping for more than one unit.,"Excellent product. I could not tell difference between expensive brand-name product and this. Performs as promised. I ordered 2 units. They shipped in one pack, flat rate. But charged shipping separately. I guess shipping charge is part of their profit."
1,TRASH CABLE NO LONGER WORKS.,PURCHASED IN JANUARY AND NOW IT'S ONLY JULY AND THIS TRASH IMPORT CABLE NO LONGER WORKS. OUTSIDE OF THE RETURN PERIOD SO NOW IT'S IN THE DUMPSTER. WILL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER CABLE AT WALMART OR TARGET
1,Worst HDMI cable,"This gets less than one star from me. I now know the difference between a good HDMI cable and a cheap useless one. After attaching the HDMI to my BluRay player, I started getting delays and gaps in the video. I thought it may have been the disc but I switched with my cable box and then the cable picture experienced the same delays and gaps. I dumped the cheap HDMI and purchased a flat HDMI higher quality cable from a big box store in Vegas and both the picture and audio work great now. Price does make a difference with HDMI and electronics. I will rely on the gold HDMI cable from now on.I did not think there was much difference in HDMI cables, but I found out there are huge differences in the quality that effects all electronic devices."
1,Defective HDMI Cord,"Received my HDMI cord very quickly only to find out that it was completely defective. I know this because I tested other HDMI cords on the same device (PS3) and they worked swimmingly. So sick of cheap, Chinese made products, get your sh*t together Amazon."
2,Not good.,"Well this product is very affordable, it lasted 2 weeks before it didn't work anymore. I feel that my $6 went for nothing. not a very good product, I did not contacted the seller with this issue because I just don't feel that it is worth my time. I am generous with the two stars one for each week that the product work for me."
1,No show,"Probably would have been a great product at a great price; however, the price must have been too good since the seller decided they couldn't/wouldn't ship it. No apologies, no negotiation, no product. Strongly suggest you avoid anything offered by this supplier.(Amazon did provide a refund, but nothing from the seller)"
4,HDMI Cable,"Works great! I don't understand why anyone would pay more. If expensive cables actually work better, I wouldn't be able to see the difference. I can't tell the difference between HDTV broadcasts and blu-ray disks going through this HDMI cable."
3,Iffy,"After a bit of use, it's somewhat fragile. Not super fragile but after some use it's not an incredibly stable picture."
3,Alright,"I bought this to be able to get better quality picture for our TV. When I tried to hook it up, the box told me that the cable was incompatible. The cable still gets used, but not for what I wanted it for."
3,Varied Performance With Devices,"Prompt delivery (especially with Amazon Prime!).Other than that, however, the HDMI Cord I received varied in performance when connected to my devices.After testing this HDMI cord for a week, I can say that the signal carried is NOT strong enough to work through most adaptors - in my case a macbook mini display port to hdmi adaptor or a div to hdmi adaptor, which was the point of me buying the HDMI cord. I did a quick swap with my ps3 HDMI cord however, so it's a relative non-issue. I would have liked to use the 6foot HDMI for my computers though."
1,This is not an HDMI cable that I received,"I actually got a micro USB cable....complete waste of time. The bag had the correct SKU number on it, but is packaged wrong."
5,Cables,"The cable works great, i use it for everything, my BluRay player, PS3, my computer works great and so much better than the price you would find at any WALMART"
5,The Little Cable that Could,This cable cost next to nothing and works as well as Monster cables on HDTVs. Why would anyone spend that much on cables when you can have these for less than $5?
1,Too good to be true,"These cables are aweful, the only reason it got 1 star is because they dont have 1/2 stars, hooked this cable up from my cable box to my tv and it was horrible, the picture was snowy, replaced it with a $10 cable I found on amazon and the picture is perfect. maybe it will work for your application but for mine it was no good. Hope this helps."
3,Incomparable price for HDMI cable,"Great price and fast shipping.I ordered two, and one of them was broken when I plugged in.I didn't bother to complain since it was so cheap."
1,Horrible,"After leaving negative review on this bad product I recieved a e-mail asking to rewrite my review in return for replacements of the HDMI cords.However when I did not write a review for them they never replaced their horrible product. Bad customer service. I paid, but unless I write a good review, I am stuck with crappy merchandise."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this cable in the hope to connect a Philips DVD player to a Samsung TV. Judging by the LOTR wide-screen DVD, my TV was unable to display a good picture: The black bars on top and bottom were green instead of black, the Philips setup menu orange instead of white, and there was so much pixel noise that the DNR could not cope with it. The sound is fine. The very same setup plays nicely over a component connection instead of HDMI. That sounds to me like bad wiring of the HDMI cable. UPDATE: I finally got a different HDMI cable, and that different cable works perfectly in the same setup and ports. Thus, I can not recommend this cable."
1,Read this before...,I have tested it between a Scientic Atlanta 8300HD PVR and a Sony Bravia KDL40V3000. The video is terrible and the sound is intermittent. I have a better result on components.
2,You get what you pay for..........,"Purchased this cable and used it on a brand new 720p Panasonic, 32 inch set with a 120hz refresh rate. My Verizon FIOS rep left an HDMI cable as well during install, so I compared the two. The Verizon cable performed flawlessly. Great picture, sound, and no problems. The inexpensive cable was subject to breakup, picture clarity was diminished, and the sound was not on par with the Verizon cable. Mind you, we are not talking about a Monster HDMI cable here, but the difference was striking.I also tried this cable on my older Hitachi 51 inch set. Compared to high end component cable (which is what I have been using), the HDMI underperformed as well. The component cable was clearly superior.If you want an inexpensive cable that will carry a signal, go for it. If you want a clear, jump off the screen picture, keep shopping."
1,This Cable is JUNK !!!,This cable is cheap JUNK!!! I bought two of them and both of them were defective! One had no audio and the other had no signal at all (unless you wiggled the cable). DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!
1,never received item,It's been a month since i ordered this product and I have still not received it.
1,Do not buy if you have 1080p,I bought these cables since they were cheap. I wasn't able to see if they were 1.3 certified. I wish I bought 1.3 cables now.I want to now buy 1.3c cables that my tv supports so I can get a better picture.
5,Works as it's supposed to!,This is just a basic HDMI cable. It does what it's supposed to and I think this is a good value for the price!
5,Works Perfectly,Awesome HDMI cable for a fraction of what you would pay in a store. Works perfectly. You would never know the difference between this and a $20 cable from an electronics store.
4,Cheap and does the trick,"Works just fine...I used it for my XBOX360. I have higher quality cables for my Blu-Ray player and computer, but this cable is sufficient for basic components. The price is nice and it works...bottom line."
4,The video & sound both signals are Good,I purchased this cable to connect my AV video output to HDMI/RCA convertor then connect to my old TV.This cable was stable and cheap it has nice video and sound signals
2,Works for some applications,"I recently received this cable, it shipped amazingly quick (Delivery between the 14th and 19th, and it arrived the 14th), BUT, this cable does not work with my High Definition Cablevision box. When i plug it into my cable box the picture has black static all over and no audio, it also flickers on and off at times. But when i plug it into my Xbox360 (the reason i bought this cable in the first place) it works PERFECTLY. I compared it against an HDMI cable that i already had that is about 2x thicker and feels like MUCH better quality, and it works exactly the same! However, its a bit tough to plug the cable in, it requires a bit of force (compared against my previous HDMI cable which slides in seamlessly)"
2,Does not work?!,"I really dislike giving 1 star ratings so I will say this gets two (assuming it does eventually work with something). I have tried to connect this to EVERY HDMI source I have in my house and still cannot get it (or the other) to even be recognized. Seeing all of the positive reviews I purchased 2 thinking it was great value for money. Take my advice and only buy one until you are certain that it will work with your components. I think you can go pretty cheap on HDMI, but with the required technology I don't think I will ever venture this cheap again."
5,Monster...we don't need no stinkin' Monster!,"Bought 2, one for the PS3 and the other for the 360, and couldn't be happier with the performance on my brand new Samsung HL67A750! I have a friend who picked up Monster Cables ($70) with his new 61"" Samsung and man was he bummed out when he discovered I paid less than 5 bucks each for these cables that put provide the exact same picture and audio quality."
5,"Good price, good product!","Great price for a quality cable. I've purchased cables from this company before, they are reputable and ship quickly.-Greg"
5,HDMI cable,I paid one cent for this product so even if it just barely worked it was good value for the price. I was plesantlysurprised to find that the construction quality was very good and that it worked very well. I don't have a lot of experience with HDMI cables but I cercainly do not have any problems with this prodluct.
1,DID NOT WORK !,I bought this for my roku 2. When I hook it up green flickering lines appeared in my TV screen and that`s about it! The cable is so skinny it can`t handle the signal strength thus it doesn`t work. Buyer beware!
2,Almost a good product,"Waited about 4 days for this to get shipped to me (Thursday - Monday). Pretty good ship time, but the moment I hooked up the cable I could tell something was wrong. There's a lot of blue-green static constantly being shown. But, for the price I paid for it (~$1.50) I figured I was gonna get something like this. I figured I'd give it a try, though, and was disappointed with what I got. Because it was only $1.50 I didn't even bother attempting to exchange the product for another one that would possibly work. Went out and bought a $5 10 foot cable that works better for my space requirements and visual quality. But, this isn't a review about the product I ended up getting, it's about this one.In short,Pros*Cheap product*Fast shipping timesCons*Lots of green static, making it basically unusable."
2,Worth the price!,The first cable received from the company did not work well and the company suggested sending a new cable which was received a couple days ago. The second cable seems to be working well.
1,Don't waste your time with this cable,"I got this cable late, the shipper didn't pay enough for the shipping, and to make matters worse, my monitor blacks out when using the cable. I know its the cable because I am currently using my friend's hdmi cable and my screen has not blacked out yet and I've been using it for over 2 hours. While gaming it blacks out constantly."
5,great buy,"Product arrived quickly and works fine. No problems hooking up to Toshiba 19"" tv. Perfect length to connect tv on the wall."
1,Get what you pay for,"PQ of these cables were good but the audio was poor, I'd have to turn my tv's volume all the way up to hear it, or run it to my receiver and have it turned all the way up."
5,HDMI Cable,It arrived within a few days and works just fine. We get an amazing picture on our television.
1,it burned by dvd player,"Once I plugged it into my LG upconverting dvd player, it burned it. There was a smell of burning and I lost control of the dvd."
4,No frills but works great.,What can I say and HDMI cable for less than a buck? It works as well as the 30 dollar one next to it.
4,Quality!!,This wire has done wonders for my life.thanks to this wire i can connect my laptop to my tv and watch what ever I want.It's amazing I paid so cheap for great quality.I will do business with them again.
1,Three useless cables,"I ordered three of these cables just to have as backup because they were so inexpensive. Upon finally finding a need for them I tried using them with my PS3. Two of the cables display a snowy image with distorted noise, and the third flickers on a proper display every now and then but mostly displays garbage."
5,Good ones,"I bought these after reading all crap about the pricey hdmi's... These were not different than the expensive, so I bought them had no problems yet. Only paid $4.60 for two pair..."
2,Impaired Image Quality,"This item is defective and does not work well. When utilizing this HDMI, it contains poor image quality, for when using this cord it has quick flashes of random image sparks. I have many HDMI cords and when switching to my other cords to see if this ""image sparks"" happens; it does not. Too many random images of random image glitches/sparks when using this HDMI."
5,its a steal.best price,"This is the best hdmi cable on amazon, i bought a 40 dollers hdmi cable in bestbuy and bought this one for another tv and i could'nt tell the difference, i would recommand this to everyone. if in need of a nother hdmi cable i will buy this in the futer."
3,Good,Its working properly with my ps 3 device as well as with the computerWill prefer to buy this again
5,Perfect,"I bought this Cable because my friend recommended it for me and it is perfect, I use it for my xbox 360 and the image is amazing, playing 2k 11 is like watching a real basketball game now and call of duty is greater then ever. Thank you, only problem was i ordered over night shipping but it took 3 days but its all good."
4,Don't let the price fool you,"These work just as well as the expensive Monster Cable brand ones at a fraction of the cost. Buy these, save your money and buy some Blu-ray discs instead."
3,Works!,"A bit flimsy, yet performs for t.v to computer videos. Hey for what I paid I can afford a few of these and give them away to friends and family not knowledgeable about HDMI. Best connection for t.v to video."
3,Good Product,"It was a good product, service was fast and can't complain at all. Would buy it again if needed one."
1,maybe a bad one?,"Maybe I just got a bad one, but mine only works when tilted a certain direction. One of those things where you have to wiggle it for a few minutes before it starts to work and then sometimes it stops working in the middle of using it. The cable worked 95 percent of the time for the first two weeks, then went to about 40 percent of the time after that. right now I have it taped down everywhere in order to keep it still enough to work."
5,Great for the price,"Anytime I go into a store to buy a product that uses an HDMI cord, the salesperson always tries to sell me some expensive cord that is clearly overpriced. Every time I still end up buying a cord just like this one off Amazon. My aunt bought a 55"" TV last year and spent $60 on an HDMI cord. I compared that cord to this one and noticed no difference - except in the price!Don't waste money on an expensive HDMI cord if you don't have it. With that being said - this isn't for you if you need a long HDMI cord. This is only 6 feet - and anything longer than 15 feet I would recommend spending a little more on an HDMI cord. The longer the cord you need, the less a cheap cord will work for you. However, since I only needed a cord that was 6 feet long, this cord is absolutely perfect."
2,poor quality,I'm not happy with this HDMI cable.the color quality suck's and it don't work with my PS3but when replace my PS3 with a better quality cable it work's fine.so you do get what pay for..
1,you get what you pay for,"This is one of those times you get what you pay for. When connecting my laptop to my TV, the video was grainy. It was much lower quality than a standard VGA cord. Also, it did not transmit audio. It was not worth the $3 I paid for it."
3,Picky on what end goes where?,"Not bad for the price. For some reason though, it gets very finicky which end goes where. Got this so I could connect my laptop to my TV so I don't have a ton of hunched over shoulders when I'm showing friends stuff online. For some reason though I found that the sound won't work if I connect one of the ends to my TV. We just put a piece of tape on the other end so we remember that that end goes to the TV."
5,HDMI bought online is the way to go...,"A great upgrade from component video sources and the like...low price, great reliable cables.HDMI is a worthy investment and an easily notable difference."
5,Stick it to the man (so long as the man has HDMI inputs!),"I was really tired of seeing these cables advertised for $40 and $50 bucks at the retail outlets. What are they thinking? What kind of profit are they making?! This is a top quality cable that improved the quality of my DVD's immesurably. I've got an upconverting DVD player and 1080P 40"" LCD. They're practically HD now. Who needs blu-ray?"
4,Can't Beat the Price,"I was curious if a cable costing this little could compare to those I've seen elsewhere for ""much"" higher prices. Well not having a personal experience to base my judgement I relied on all the favorable reviews and I have not been disappointed. I can't say for certain if the picture quality of my Poloroid Element HDTV changed significantly, but I did notice a greater difference in improved volume sound and strength. That and the simple fact this one cable replaces two multi-plug component cables allows me to highly recommend the purchase of this item. The service and fast shipping from this seller is also commendable. Buy it!"
2,All HDMI cables are not equal,"This only worked intermittently between my DVDr & TV. It would work for about 10 minutes then the screen would go black (most times not working at all or having a 30 sec. delay before the signal starts). I replaced it with a ""HDMI 1.3a Category 2 Certified Cable"" and have not had the same problem."
1,WARNING: You get what you pay for,"I was very skeptical about this cable given the low price, but most of th reviews were favorable. It does not work with my brand new Pioneer 1080 upconvert DVD player. I went to best buy ang fot one for $20, that works just fine. It tried it with my friend's player, still no signal. There is no return label and I will probably end up paying more in return that it was worth in the first place. Stick to known brands that this low quality stuff!!"
5,"Cheap price, great cable!","This cable works great! Don't be fooled by the price. I'm currently using it with my Playstation 3 and switch to use with my XBOX 360 too. No need to spend the $20 to $100 that some retailers charge for a six foot cable. I have an LG 720p HDTV and there are no picture or sound problems. I was skeptical at first in purchasing a low price cable but I figured I'd take the chance and because I read the other reviews and most were positive. As one reviewer said, no need to buy, gold plated, loud named, cutting edge space age technology, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, blah, blah, blah, cable. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Gets the job done...poorly,"These are cheap cables. End of discussion. They perform like cheap cables. Noticeable difference between this and a HDMI/DVI cable I had when trying it on PS3. Build quality feels cheap. Yeah HDMI is digital, but you still need a decent cable. Don't go nuts getting HDMI, but don't spend $5 either, spend a few bucks and get something good, there will be noticeable difference in quality."
2,Obviously cheap,"I bought three of these items because they were listed for like 50 cents apiece, and the first one I hooked up only worked for about a week before crapping out. I haven't even tried the other two. I should have expected a crappy product, but there were a lot of positive reviews on here. Oh well, it was only [...]"
1,Not for Samsungs,"If you have a samsung, get a certified category 2 cable. This one causes too much flicker."
1,Too good to be true! Go for better.,"I ordered this cable (and the divx dvp5990 player) because of all the positive reviews here on amazon. The quality didn't seem all that bad for a chinese product but when i hooked it up to my 1080p 40"" Toshiba tv there was only a black screen. Long story short, i tried switching it with the hdmi from our cable box and viola! I recommend going for a higher rated cable so you too won't be ripped off ($4.50 X's however many bad cables they put out adds up), and your still going to save compared with an outlet store."
5,Eforcity has been excellent,These HDMI cables arrived in a timely manner and work just as well as a gold monster cable. The big difference is in the cost savings from buying at Amazon. I have recommended everyone I know to buy the cables on-line. Same quality product with a price that can't be beat!
3,works in some situations,"When I connected it to my ps3 it showed with static, but it works fine on my direct tv box so... it was worth the money I guess"
4,ok,You cant beat the price. You show me the difference in terms of quality of picture from a $5 hdmi and a $50 hdmi and ill buy you lunch.
4,good value,It came in faster than the product I bought to use it with and it was a great value compaired to others.
4,good for the money,"After personally witnessing several other cheap hdmi cables stop working at the electronics retail store i work at, i was curious to see what a 2 dollar hdmi could do.Right out of the box you can tell its nothing fancy, and not dressed up with the extra shielding. I plugged it in to my hd-dvd player and was not able to notice any difference between that and a similiar $60 hdmi cable. As far as im concerned so far, a digital cable is a digital cable. However, we have only been using it for a few weeks now so only time will tell if there really is a difference between a 2 dollar hdmi and 60-100 dollar cable."
5,"Great Wire, Great Price","I don't know all the inner workings of these wires, but I do know that my systems now work on my HDTV, the picture quality is better than before, and it doesn't get too much cheaper than this."
2,you get what you pay for...,works ok for low resolution stuff and lower audio quality. but with mt PS3 watching netflixs it cuts in and out. yes i tired other cables with the same settings.
5,Works Perfect,"No need to go out and purchase $10 dollar cables. I purchased 3 of these for under $5 and all work as they should. They are a great length, excellent price, works 100%, and I haven't had any issues yet. As with any cable or tech accessory, I don't expect they to outlive me, however at this price I'd be completely satisfied if they lasted 3 years or longer, which as of right now they look as if they are going to last a good long while"
3,"Great cables, just make sure you got the right length.","I received 3 ft. cables instead of 6 ft. I didn't need the extra length but if I had I wouldn't be too pleased. Still, for the price they cannot be beat."
1,Why such price fluctuation?,"Depending on when you check, the price jumps from 77 cents to over $5.00. Why can't Amazon just stabilize some of their pricing? Does anyone know if there is a better time of the week to buy this and other electronic (tvs, etc.) components? Those have several hundred dollar swings in their pricing constantly. Starting to lose a little trust. Thanks for any help."
1,You get what you pay for,"There *IS* a difference between these and Monster cables. I had a pair of these first before upgrading to Monsters and boy I'm glad I spent the extra $$$. I have a Samsung 46"" 4671 120hz LCD HDTV and you can definitely see the difference between high-end cables and cheap ones like these. Everyone on here that says there isn't a difference is full of it. That's probably because they didn't have their TVs on the highest settings, or have a lower end HDTV. I tested this by pausing a picture on the Blu-ray disc of the movie ""Cars"" and switched between the two cables. WOW. The cheaps ones showed more pixelation around the edges of characters and the colors were NOT as vibrant. I then tried the Monster 1000HD cable and immediately was taken back by how much better the picture was. The same goes for HD Cable channels.I then tested video games on my Sony PS3. Again, the cheap cables showed more square edges around characters and items.So buyer beware. you get what you pay for"
1,Don't get your hopes up!,"The cable is not that good, I have experienced some digital dropouts not as good as my other brand HDMI cable."
5,Works just as well as the much more expensive cables!!!,"I notice only a very very slight difference in using this cable versus the $25 one from Best Buy. We are using it on a 32"" 1080p HDTV. So thankful that we spent so much less on this cable. I will definitely order more in the future if needed."
5,Excellent. Worked great. Cable thicker/better than expected!!,"Worked great. Quality better than expected. Powered my 55"" Sony from UVERSE receiver. Cable arrived quickly. So inexpensive, ordered a spare! :-)"
1,Bad Seller,I relied too much on the reviews and now I don't have my product or my refund. I ordered an hdmi cable in November of 2011 and was supposed to receive by the middle of the month and it is now the new year and still have not heard or received anything from the seller. I have tried contacting them several times and still no luck. If I were you I would think twice about ordering with this seller.
5,"Good HDMI Cable, Awesome Price","Im really glad that I purchased this HDMI Cord. Works amazing, good quality cord.. Works just like the super crazy future space capable monster cables ;)"
5,Great,This product is awesome! No difference between this cable and the expensive ones. Do yourself a favor and save the bucks for something else worthwhile. This baby does the job!
5,great product shipped fast AWESOME price,very happy witht his product. it shipped fast and the price was great. would purchase again!
1,"Good for a few months, maybe","Starting in February 2010, after less than three months of use, two of these cables have tolerance or continuity problems with the connector on the TV end. If I jiggle the connector and hold it just right, the cables work OK. If I substitute other cables between the same devices, all is well.Purchased three of these in Nov 2008, tested when new and they seemed to work fine. I put them in a drawer. Started using two of them in December 2009 between identical BluRay players and one LG TV and one Samsung TV. Worked fine for a while. I gave the third cable to a neighbor last week and it is still working for her. Another HDMI cable (Panasonic OEM) connected between a DVD recorder and the Samsung TV has been working fine since December 2008."
4,Excellent,I would definitely recommend this product! The seller shipped it fast and it arrived in excellent condition. I haven't used them yet because they got here before my new tv but I have previously ordered from this seller and everything worked just fine.
5,great,I chose it because it's cheap and it turns out work very well. Only thing is the goldplating Seems to be a little cheesy
3,"Great price, not sure about the product","Product arrived on time and as described, however I am not too happy with the quality.Since plugging up this cable I have noticed some scan lines occasionally appearing especially when picture is static. I am not sure if this is a problem with the cable or my TV itself, but I did not have these lines when using component cables. I'll have to give another brand of cable a try to diagnose the signal noise. If its the cable, I really can't complain since the price was so low. You get what you pay for. Others seem to have no complaints with the cable so I certainly wouldn't dissuade anyone from giving the cable a try for the price it's at."
4,Great Product....Poor Shipping,"The cable works great! I would never recommend purchasing HDMI cables from circuit city type stores unless you just want to throw away money. However, the item was supposed to ship right away by priority mail but I didn't receive it until 17 days later. When I contacted the vendor they gave me a $5 credit towards $18 shipping fee. Still $13 was too much to pay for the slowest mail service available in the US"
1,Faulty cable,I purchased this hdmi cable and it worked for a little while but the quality started to fade and it eventually quit working all together.
5,Good Cable,I bought this after looking in stores like walmart where the price was like 20 dollars for a hdmi cable. I was using a s-video cable earlier for connecting my laptop to the tv. This is more than worth for its cheap price and the quality is great.I bought this based on cnet reviews regarding hdmi cables where they said that the performance of all cables are the same. It definitely is a good buy.
2,Quality is questionable,"I ordered two of these cables a year ago. First one I opened and works great, no problems. Just purchased a new HDMI device for my HDTV last week, so I opened the second cable, and it doesn't work. I thought it may be the device instead of the cable, so I swapped cables and the device works fine. Tried again with the second cable, same results - doesn't work.Since the price is inexpensive for these cables, I knew I was taking a chance on inferior quality products, and the results validated that assumption. Returning the cable would cost me more in shipping charges than the price of the cable, so it will simply go into the trash. Next time, I'm looking for a better quality cable."
2,"Worked fine for a few months, now having constant dropouts.","This cable worked fine for a few months, but lately it has been suffering from constant dropouts. I can't get through pretty much any session on the computer without the video going out over and over again."
3,took for ever,"product is as described, and you will be satisfied. The worst thing was that it took a little bit shy of a month to receive, I couldnt believe this"
5,Awesome Buy!,I bought this HDMI cable to hook up my PS3 to my HDTV. It works great and definitely worth spending a couple bucks on than shelling out more money for a more expensive cable. I would recommend buying.
5,fraction of cost,"This HDMI connecting cable works perfectly well for HDTV to DVD connection.Best of all, it is about one tenth the price of most HDMI connectors sold in electronic stores."
5,Great everything,"The cable, store and price were/are perfect. I'm going to buy another and recommend to everyone I know."
5,Works Just Fine,"I don't know a lot about this cable as far as it's manufacturing specifications (wire quality, guage, insulation and sheathing), but I plugged it in and it works."
5,Works as expected and price was right.,"It is a cable, it should work and the price is right. What more is to say (smile), it is a cable"
4,Works Good,"I bought this HDMI Cable on Amazon, it works fine out of the box. I would recommend for ppl who are looking for a less expensive HDMI cable.Cheers"
4,HDMI Cable,So far I have only used this product one time as it was bought to be a back up hdmi cable for my tv. The one time it was used it did exactly what it was suppose to do. No complaints.
5,Simple product with a low price tag,"I purchased this HDMI cable for use with my PS3 and 32"" AOC LCD HDTV. It works very well and has an extremely low price tag. Cheap HDMI cables are notorious for 'losing quality' over time but don't listen to that when you hear it. Cables are an all or nothing type of deal. If the bits make it from your output to your input, everything's working find. If it stops working one day...I'll just buy another. I'll buy 10 its so cheap. Works fine. Get it now."
4,Great Deal!,This is the best cable value vs. price that i have found and it works perfectly. Also it IS 1080p capable.
2,Good but have some issues with them,I bought these cables for a pretty good price but have had a few issues with some of them. The gold connector has fallen off 3 of them so far but the company has agreed to send me replacements so as long as the company is backing it that's all that matters to me. I have had top of the line cables do the same thing so it's nothing new but to have so many is odd.
5,good cheap cable,"I ordered these cables because they were cheap, the arrived looking good and working well. They also transmitted sound well. Very pleased."
4,Best Quality in Best Price,Awesome experience..... picture was crystal clear after i plugged in the HDMI cable.....the amazing thing was the i was able to hear sound in my LCD and not in laptop.... the thing which impressed alot because it was really problematic when watching movie with external audio device(like speaker of laptop or connecting another speaker separately)....Con:The only thing i feel can be improved is length of the cable.....Rest its THE BEST thing in this price :) go for it ;)
5,perfect!,Not only is the price amazing for this cord your tv picture is greatly enhanced. this is pretty much a steal i would recommend this to anybody!
2,No HD On ROKU LT,"I purchased this cable to connect my new ROKU LT to a new HD TV. It works great for regular definition, but does not work at all when I switch the ROKU to HD. I got the same result when using a different TV and ROKU. I was able to get everything working properly when I used a different HDMI cable from another manufacturer,"
2,Review,"This hdmi cable was not even 6 feet! I'm very disappointed :( I think i should be able to get a replacement,"
4,Cheaper is sometimes better,"I was a worried about buying such a cheap hdmi cable. I've seen some pretty pricy ones and was unsure of what the differnce was. Well i hooked up my ps3 to a 1080p 27 "" t.v and the quality is AMAZING!!! I'm sure glad i found this item or else i wouldve spent a whole lot of dinero for the same thing."
2,Picture flickers when using these cables.,"I thought all HDMI cables were the same, but I was wrong. I bought these to use with a brand new TV and a brand new DVD. Most of the time, they are OK, but I get a periodic flicker of static filling up the bottom portion of my screen periodically. This continued to occur for the entire week I used them. I then decided to spend a few dollars more and bought Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet. These cables were much thicker and robust. The flicker disappeared the minute I switched to a different cable and has not returned."
5,great product,Ordered 4 of these as they wanted an arm and a leg at Best Buy for them. They work just fine and would definitely order more in the future. Great buy!
1,HDMI Cable review,When I connect this cable to my DVD/VCR the VCR will not play. When I connect this cable to my TV there is snow on the lower frequency channels when watching TV. I have disconnected it and thrown it into my old cables drawer. I may use it again if I only wish to watch DVDs.
5,Can't complain,"I bought this cable for my Xbox since the original AV cables got torn up (how did that happen, I really don't know) but I bought this cable so I can continue to use my Xbox, and honestly it works great! Used it for two different tv's and the quality is great on both my 47"" and my 32"". So don't be afraid buy it."
5,Great Value,"I took my tv to get repaired, under warranty, three times. Finally, the third time I asked the repair man to test it before I took it back home as the image and audio on HDMI inputs would go in an out randomly. He tested it and it worked fine. I took my tv home, used one of these cheap cables and the problems came back, I bought new cheap cables and the problem continues. So im going to go buy an expensive cable, if the problem is solved then I will know its the cable, if its not solved i will know its the TV.................these cables are working fine. great value. Im happy."
1,"Good price, but wished it worked.....","i used this hdmi cable to hook up my computer to my tv. it worked fine for a day, then started flickering... After that the cable just stopped working. i have tried on several different tvs but it doesnt work."
5,Amazing Cable!!!!,"Cable works just as a more expensive HDMI cable would. Very VERY pleased with the quality and the price. I ordered mine from Importer520, and it came within' the time frame, so i recommend you order from them."
5,great,"Couldn't b happier, works for my ps3 and cost pocket change compared to hdmi cables at local stores, great value and works sane as 40$ cables"
5,Great transaction,I was a little skeptical because of the low price but I use the cable everyday with no problem. I have in fact recommended this seller to a few friends because I was so happy with them. Will buy from again!
4,hdmi cable,Slow but sure if you order with free shipping as they use postal service who still seem to be useing horse transportation.
1,not good,after reading all good reviews i decide to buy this cable but after it was shipped and i plug it to my pc i was very disappointed.Spent couple more $ and buy a good one.
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY,Didn't work at all. Almost broke my ps3. Terrible quality. I do not recommend this. It almost messed my TV up too.
4,Nice,HDMI cable 2m .. is six feet long...have not tried it yet but the build quality looks good.. and is gold plated...go for it..
2,Poor sound quality,"I purchased several of these based on almost 5 star rating. The picture is ok, but the sound is horrible. We are switching to a higher quality cable."
4,Cheap HDMA cable,"Seems to be working just fine. Very thin cable, must more flexible than most heavier-gauge cables I've owned in the past. Flexibility is nice, as long as it doesn't come at some cost to quality (no idea if it does)."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"It worked for two weeks and suddenly my HD channels began to freeze. I almost called the cable company out thinking it was my DVR box, but decided to buy some more expensive cables at Target. Problem is gone!! Lesson learned. I am on a tight budget and thought I had found something great. Nope!"
5,Perfect size!,6Ft is the perfect length here and the quality and speed this low price cable put out was awesome! buy this item if you just need a spare or as an input control!
5,awesome. thanks.,Works just as well as the silly expensive ones that advertise absurd superfluous stats. Definitely purchase this if you can't find one cheaper that you trust.
5,HDMI Cable,My husband was leary of this product when I told him I bought it for $7 with shipping. After all they cost over $50 in some stores! How can they be so cheap and work?Talk about a nice surprise! We hooked the cable into the PS3 and immediately the HD aspect worked brilliantly.Don't be fooled by low price! This is the place to buy! Oh and the shipping...US Post said it would take 2 weeks...try 2 days! Super fast!!!!
5,HDMI cable great value,"Fantastic value for this product. Bought this cable based on a review by CNET, there is no need to spend $50 on a cable that you can get for under $10. Works great and would buy it again."
5,"Man, I hate the A/V cable industry.","Way back when I worked in Best Buy, we used to sell 10' USB cables for $37. With my employee discount, which had me paying a few percent over the company's cost, that same cable cost $1.40. Needless to say, the egregious markup of accessories in retail stores was impressed upon me.When I bought my Xbox 360 in a local big box retailer, I refused to pay $50 for a cable I knew could be found for a few dollars online. Especially with a digital cable such as this- brand doesn't matter all that much. I came online, ordered this one instead, and it's working beautifully.If you buy cables in the store, and there's not some dire emergency that requires them.. you fail."
5,Just as so many have said!,This ultra low cost baby does the job!My PS3 looks great with this bad boy:)I would like a little more bass though but for thisprice you won't find a better deal. Pick these up andforget what the big names my try to pull on you!
5,Buy These Cables,"Despite reading the rave reviews here, I ordered these cables with some trepidation. After all, anything too good to be true is, well, too good to be true.The cables arrived and I hooked them up. The TV said : HDMI CABLE CONNECTED. The connection from the Blu-Ray Player suddenly went from 1080i to 1080P.The picture was awesome.BUY THESE CABLES!"
3,Ok,"Item was shipped with insufficient postage, so I had to pay an extra $1.50 when the postman arrived at my door. Haven't been able to check to see if it works yet, as I am still waiting on an adapter to be shipped (from the same seller). I guess you get what you pay for, although I would have preferred to pay the extra shipping cost up front!!"
1,Cable Didn't Work When It Arrived,"Sadly, when this HDMI cable reached me it did not work at all. It was defective out of the box. I bought it for the cheap price, so I guess I got what I paid for."
5,Everything as advertised.,"Everything as advertised. Good quality, fast shipment (considering it came from China), and cheap. What more do you want? Don't buy $30-$50 cables at the big box stores unless you sympathize with their stockholders."
1,unnecessary come on,"The Amazon web site implied that this cable was needed with the DVD I bought. In fact it was not. It is a small item, not worth returning, but I felt cheated."
4,Excellent Choice for the Price,"This is a great product for the price. Charges the ipod while allowing you to listen over the fm channel in your car.Only problem for me was it was difficult to see the FM channel on the display due to the positioning of my power outlet in my car. Still, for the price it is a great deal."
1,Audio cuts out on non-HD programming,Bought 2 of these. I began noticing problems after a week or so. The audio cuts out frequently (1 to 7 times a minute) whenever we are watching a non-HD channel. The other cable works fine... for now!
1,Don't buy,"OK, HDMI is digital, it's either on or it's off. That was my thinking. Well this cable is sooooo thin that your lucky if you get a picture to stay on constantly. It's either got interference or the picture goes out, then comes back on. Though HDMI is digital, the interference that these cables introduce to causes them to be useless. Don't buy. If you don't believe me then go ahead and buy. You might as well just flush your two bucks down the drain, cause the cable won't work"
5,"Great performance, unbelievable value.","I used this to connect my PS3 to my 72"" Toshiba DLP and the HD picture is amazing. There is absolutely no reason to by a more expensive cable. The length on this is excellent and it transmits the digital signal flawlessly. Highly recommended."
2,Good picture. Sound quality bad! :(,"Bought this baby for $5, including shipping from ClearAV. A lot of people seemed very happy with it. I directly connected my PS3 to a 34"" dynex flat screen TV. Picture looks great, but sound quality is bad. Loud noises and certain other noises cause a horrible deep noise (not familiar with terminology) that actually hurts my roommates ears so much that they mute the TV while we're playing."
1,is there different kinds?,i feel like i wasted my money. tv doesnt work with these cables and i just bought my tv in dec.
1,Didn't Deliver the Audio,"I purchased this cable because it popped up as a ""suggestion"" when I ordered my Sharp Aquos HDTV through Amazon. Like many other reviewers, at $1.98 (add another two or three dollars for shipping and handling) I figured the risk was low. Keep in mind the seller advertised this as a $59.95 value. Once I hooked up the cable to the TV, it produced an adequate image but absolutely no audio. I tried it in each of the HDMI ports, meticulously went through all the settings, and no change. I ended up using the component and audio cables provided by Time Warner with my HD DVR and everything looks and sounds fine. I won't send the HDMI cable back because it's not worth the time, money, and effort. Suffice it to say you do get what you pay for."
2,Need to last longer,"I understand that this is a good deal, but our cord broke after 3 weeks of use of it. I am not happy with how it has gone out so quickly, worth it for a short amount of time, but next time I will buy a more expensive one from the store."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"Product came as expected and is exactly what I was looking for, a low cost HDMI Cable. Definitely a better deal than any other offer I have found. Company representatives also attentive and reliable."
5,performs as advertised,"What can I say? It is an HDMI cable, and as such it passes digital data just as you'd expect -- and just as well as the $50 cable you would have bought at Best Buy (or the $20 cable you would have bought at Wal-Mart)."
5,Awesome!,perfect as described and picture quality from my laptop to HDTV is super. worth every penny. does what other costly one does.
5,Great HDMI Cable,"Well worth it! I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it out. I ended up ordering three of them."
5,HDMI,"So glad I ordered this when I did, it wasn't needed at the time but couldn't pass up the great deal...Luckily it was just waiting to be used, and my fiance just the other day needed it for our new TV and Home theater system :)"
5,"Great value, great product",I was very pleased with the cable. Wasn't sure if it would be all that great considering the cheap price. It works great. What a great value!
5,6 FT HDMI,"Product works just as good as any other HDMI, don't let anyone else say differently. I paid initially 60 dollars for a 3ft HDMI cable at Best Buy, started looking for a longer one and found this. Really is the best deal you'll get"
5,Forget high priced HDMI cables!,"Forget paying outrageous prices for HDMI cables. This unit works every bit as well as the higher priced ""brand""names. My daughter in law used to work for BEST BUY and they were told to push the cables as it was pure gold. Trust me- you WON""T be able to see a difference. I'll NEVER buy anything else more expensive than these."
3,Replacement Cable Quality Just Average,"These were such a good price, I purchased four of them, thinking I would use one for a replacement cable for the TV and the other three would be saved for future needs. I noticed the cable wire was much thinner than the cable being replaced. Hooked up the cable to the TV and immediately noticed the reception was quite poor, with white pixels flashing on the TV screen. Replaced the first cable with another of the purchased cables. This one seems to work better. I don't think the reception is quite as good with the purchased cable. Maybe it's my imagination, but the detail doesn't seem to be there as with the original cable. For the price and as a spare, these cables might be OK. I've purchased more expensive HDMI cables through Amazon and I was happier with them. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Simple and it works!,"Not really too much to say here. I use this cable with my Xbox 360 and the cable itself works perfectly. I WILL say that if you wish to use any Xbox headsets in conjunction with HD, it's slightly more complicated. In terms of getting high definition on an Xbox, however, it could not be more straightforward and easy. Just plug everything in and it's good to go."
5,Outstanding !!,Superb quality at a price that can't be beat !!I purchased 4 of these cables ~I use one for my PS3I use one for my BlueRay PlayerI use one for my Satellite BoxI use the other for my DVR recorderNot a single complaint ~ even better that the 30$ cable that I originallybought from Best Buy ...................................
5,Perfect cable,This cable works just like any high-quality HDMI cable -- the image and sound are fantastic. No loss in quality compared to a $50 retail cable.
5,Great cable for the price.,"Great cable, for the price , I will purchase more as needed,I have not tried this cable with my gaming console so I don't know if it could handle the speed?"
5,Great HDMI cables,"These cables are a great value. I have used them to connect a roku, a hd dvd player, and the cable box up to an hdtv."
3,Good Product,Is what it is. I needed a spare HDMI cable and found this one to be the best deal. Thanx!
2,"For whatever reason, it didn't work","As much as I was impressed by the huge amount of praise for this cable, it simply didn't work for me. I bought one of the new 250 GB PS3 systems and plugged it into my Dynex LCD TV with one of these cables. It worked fine right up until I tried playing Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe with it. It had a strobe light flash effect to the progression of the video, it froze up alot and it eventually faded to static (although I will admit that the audio was fine throughout all of this). I tried using a friend's Monoprice 28AWG CL2 High Speed cable and that worked perfectly, so I know it's not a problem with the console or my TV. Maybe I got a bad cord, but it didn't work and I'm now looking elsewhere."
2,Cheap but not the best,Order this cable for my computer monitor so I could use my high dollar HDMI cable for my TV. The first cable I received didn't work. So I had to get a replacement. When the second one came in it worked just fine. So be careful when you buy this product. (Also I don't know if it is my Computer monitor or what but this cable doesn't seem to detect when it is plugged in to a unit that auto detects sources.
5,Works just fine!,Cheap HDMI cable. I'm all about that. It works just as well as an expensive $30 hdmi you find at best buy or something like that
4,Nice Turnaround,I ordered this product on Christmas Day and had it hooked up before the New Year. Thanks for the quick turnaround.
5,Great Quality,The HDMI cables are great and of course is excellent when adding them toyour components.
4,White Line Bug?,"For the price you can't go wrong no matter what. Although while playing some games and tv shows with the hdmi cable, I get a thin white line all along the very top of the screen. I don't recall other reviews mentioning this so mayb mines just defective?...."
3,Ghost image - but very good for the price,"I used about 6 of them for 6 different machine (2 DVD, 2 Cable, 1 HD, 1 PC) and all of them have slight ghost image."
5,Works Great!,"I used this cable to connect aSamsung DTBH260F HDTV Terrestrial Receiverto thisLG 42LH50 HDTVin order to have a second tuner for recordings. The cable worked great and replaced a total of 5 cables (3 for component video, two for audio) which cuts down on the clutter in back of my TV.Very good value, shipping was very reasonable considering the cable was almost free."
1,Lousy cable,This cable was only $1 plus $3 shipping. It didn't work just like a similar cable from Fry's. Not worth returning. Forget this one.
3,HDMI,These HDMI cables are good but they are NOT 1.3 so if you need the faster rate or 7.1DTS for sound you will want to spend the extra 5 dollars and get a set that is 1.3 certified.
5,Reliable and affordable,"I bought this about a year ago to use with my new VIZIO 37"" TV. I have now been using it for over a year and in that time I moved once and it still works great as ever after unplugging and re-plugging everything back in again.No complaints, amazing value."
2,Worked great for about 4 months..,"I bought this product because it was a cheap HDMI cable. Everything was working great as usual until one day my Xbox wouldn't even recognize the cable. So either my HDMI port is broken, or the cable stopped working."
5,Great Follow Up,This in relation to a past purchase that was not fulfilled correctly. They took care of the problem and sent me out my replacement product with no problems.
4,Best Buy,The cost of my HDMI cables was one of the best purchase I've made on Amazon by far. The quality of the product was superb to any in store purchase I could have made. I know without a doubt I will look at Amazon for any products I need before going to any outlet to buy anything again.
1,broke just after 3 months,"While it did work for 3 months, I never removed the cable from the device it was connected to from day 1. However, once I started plugging it into another device, it just broke!! I had probably switched between the devices hardly 15 times and then it no more fit. I could clearly see the copper connectors bent badly."
1,"Great Price, but...",I purchased this cable after reading really good reviews and the unbeatable price. I have a Vizio TV that I was trying to connect to a PS3. It would not work with any of the HDMI ports. I later purchased a relatively cheap HDMI cable from a local store and it worked perfect.
1,hdmi cable,I ordered the hdmi cable and granted it was a cheap price but when it arrived the construction quality was horrible. The cable was very thin the thinest hdmi cable that ive ever seen... I hooked it up to my surround sound and the performance was horrible could barely hear sound coming out of the speakers...In short i guess you get what you pay for with this product. Its better to spend the extra money for a better quality product.I would never buy this product again.
4,Very good for the price,"I found this product thru a CNet review. Ordered it immediately. After it arrived, the cable would work on and off. It wasn't reliable. I contacted the seller thru Amazon and they agreed to replace it. The second one is working great. No issues so far. It's very good for the price I paid."
5,wow,can you just say wow how cheap this was and worked i was very weary about this but sure enough worked great thanks
4,HDMI cable,I ordered five cables but only received four. I sent an email with details and received the fifth cable shortly. No problems. I have not seen the bill yet but I donot expect any additional charges.
4,Great Deal for Great Product,product works great!!! couldn't be happier about this purchase. works well with cox high def box and ps3. Thanks for supplying a product at a reasonable price
3,HDMI Cable - Not for 3D tv or PS3,This cable works fine for connecting my PC to the TV for streaming HULU but will not work for connecting PS3 to my 3D television. You need to use a High-speed (version 1.4 I think) HDMI cable to get the full capabilities of 3D. I did not know that until it was too late and I had already purchased 3 of these. Ah well.
4,it works,"Like the title, it works fine. I have been using it for the last two months and it has been working well."
5,DVI Gear HDMI cables,"Great price, for a basic 1.3 HDMI cable that works. Bought a couple extra of thses to complement some additions and upgrades to my home theater. Carries the signal and does its job, no need to waste money on those overpriced name brand cables with ""gold plated, quintuple twisted wires, etc."" It's a digital signal, so either it works or it doesn't, save you rmoney and buy these."
5,Works Great!,"Wanted a working hdmi cable for less than the expensive prices in stores, and thats exactly what I got. Works just fine, no problems"
5,very good cables for the price,I bought these cables to hook up a ps3 to an HDTV. Very good results with very amazing picture results. I would highly recommend these cables for someone looking to save some money without sacrificing quality.
5,HDMI Cable,"The HDMI cables arrived as promised for an unbelievable price. They work great. In fact, I need to get a couple more..."
3,"Cheaply Made, But works... Mostly","I bought 4 of these, 3 of them worked initially, 1 of them died within a month... However for 2 dollars I got 2 working 6 foot HDMI cords, I just recommend buying a few extras incase they poop out."
5,Super product,"Here is a real bargain. Why pay big $ for an HDMI cord. This one works as well as any you can buy. I use it to connect my new Toshiba 47"" LCD TV to the Phillips upscaling VCR I bought on Amazon. Not only does it do the job, but I received it about 2 days after I ordered it. A super deal and fast shipping. What's not to love about this product?"
5,Great product - excellent bargain!,This is a great product. The cable works great. It was a bargain - no shipping - and was delivered very quickly.
4,works as expected,"arrived on time, works just fine, no problemsI have read a lot of warnings about buying cheap cables, but this cable has not had any problems."
1,Very Poor Quality Cable,"This cable came fulfilled from Amazon from a third party merchant. The quality was incredibly poor, we could not get an image to appear reliably on the screen. 0 Stars from me!"
3,Connector,"This HDMI cable connector allows me to see an excellent video image in playback mode of the VHS and the DVD but without sound. In order to get the sound, I had to connect the audio cables separately. I do not know if ALL HDMI CABLES WORK THE SAME WAY, that is, without carrying the sound, or it is because this type cannot carry the sound and more expensive HDMI cables do. If you know, please drop me a note.Thanks"
1,Cable didn't work,I bought this cable to use with my new Roku and after hours of trouble shooting with them we discovered that it was the cable that was faulty. I replaced the cable and everything works perfectly.
1,"DON'T BUY!! It worked, for about an hour.... USELESS","I was very pleased when i got this and it worked so i gave it 5 stars, BIG MISTAKE.These are very low quality, HDMI FAKES!!!! I cut it open to see what exactly is made ofvery tiny speaker wire(speaker wire wouldnt be a correct term because speaker wire is atleast double the gauge of these wires)Save your headache and buy a $20 hdmi from walmart, they ACTUALLY WORK!!!!I KNOW your saying its only $2 what could it hurt, your just throwing away money if you buy this...MY LAPTOP CHARGER IS THICKER THAN THESE HDMI CORDS AND THAT IS JUST NOT RIGHT"
1,Poor quality?,"There were a ton of great reviews for this product and I needed an HDMI cord. Despite picking 2 day shipping it took a good 2 weeks to arrive. That wouldn't have bothered me except on plugging it in to my PS3, all my screen did was flicker. Luckily it was only 3 bucks so not much risk but I'll be tossing it."
1,cheap,spend a couple of bucks more and you will be satisfied. The picture is not as crisp as with other HDMI I have used in the past with just a couple of dollars more of a difference.
1,garbage,"Do not buy the cheap HDMI cables, they do not work well with full 1080P Apple TV. Total rip off."
5,works for me!,"Can't beat the price. I'm not audio/video guy, but it performs as well as cables I've spend 10x as much for. For the price, I think it's worth the shot. Might be exactly what you're looking for."
2,Disappointed,"I paid a very good price for this item and it was shipped very quickly.However, within just a few days of use it intermittently stoped working.If I wiggle it, it will work again. There seems to be a short near one of the HDMI connectors. The weight of the cord eventually pulls on the connection enough tocreate the short. I don't know if the product was defective when manufactured or if the cord was used and defective and shipped to me in that condition."
3,Good cable for the price,"The Cable seems to not be able to transmit higher than 720p, but for the price, it is quite a bargain."
4,Works great,I'm not sure there can be any distinguishable traits to an HDMI cable. This cable was cheap and works just fine. Comes just as the description states.
5,Why would you spend more on a HDMI??,"I feel sorry for anyone who pays a ton more for these in stores, there's no need to. This one is great! Very happy."
1,the cable doesn't even work at all,The HDMI cable just does NOT work at all when I connected it to my devices. I don't expect high quality but it should at least work; it is so cheap that it doesn't even work.
4,value for the money,Even with the full shipping charge applied to each individual cable the price was less than 25% of the ones in stores. The cables appear to be of the same quality and work fine.
3,Watch for interferrence,"Good price and works fine in most applications except:near a wireless link on my receiver. I connected a ""higher quality"" that cost 10 times as much and that worked. Others have had same issue with that receiver. I moved this cable to a different connection and it works fine!"
1,HDMI Cables,"These cables took weeks in shipping, even though I was falsely advised they had been shipped. Their small gauge makes me wonder if they can do the job. My cable company supplied me with a cable with a much large diameter. I did not use these cables."
1,"Do not use if you want HD, 3D, or 1080i or 1080p.","Do not use if you want HD, 3D, or 1080i or 1080p. I looked at the pictures when i purchased 6 of these. I started laughing when i opened the DHL/ USPS bag.Started sdhipping DHL then they turned it over to the U.S. post office to ship it from Kentuky to me. Maybe DHL got lost. Anyway.... these cables are not very high quality. Actually quality is not a word i should use with these at all. These cables are hdmi true. They are not shielded. And one of the cables out of the bag did not work correctly. The video is now horizontaly challanged. Go to Wal-Mart they have good cabled on sale for 10.00 that are 3D, Reverse Audio, and Network. Now that is not a bad deal. I did get what I paid for. Low class hdmi cables. I know better but was in a hurry. Here is a link to HDMI 1.4 standards[...]"
3,plastic package...,"The 2 hdmi cables are in plastic packages separately. I thought they will use a box instead. I saw my friend's cable who bought it from Amazon, it is in a box. I didn't measure it but it seems it is not the same lenght as their advertisement (6 feet long). I hope this will last."
4,It works as we need it to,Cable does exactly what it is suppose to do. Got it a couple of years ago when I purchased a surround sound system so it was pretty much a freebie.
4,Delivers a nice picture,"This is far less expensive than monster cables and just as good. It's kind of like claiming that your digital photos will look better if you transfer them to your computer with a more expensive USB cable. The only difference can be in the durability of the cable and the insulation. I haven't had this cable long enough to know how durable it will be, but I know I can replace it at least 6 times with shipping before I will have paid as much a standard retail HDMI cable. It's a shame that most people aren't getting the most of their HDTVs because no retailer will carry an HDMI cable without 650% markup. I have a purchased two of these to connect my amfm receiver, DVD player and tv. Everything works perfectly. HDMI cables transmit a digital signal, not analog, so there's no way to claim that you're going to get a better picture with a more expensive cable. It's either going to work or it's not."
5,GREAT PRICE!,"This HDMI cable works great, i use it for my Xbox 360. It's a steal with such a low price"
4,decent cable,Don't think its a high speed cable. Which I needshipping was fast. Works fine for TV just not play station in full HD.
3,HDMI Cable for Home Use,This cable met my needs pricewise. I thought 6ft would be enough but the cable is a little stiff and that might be why it doesn't seem as long as I thought it would be when stringing it through to the back of my TV. Next time I will order one a little longer and better quality in hopes to get one that is a little more flexible.
4,Good quality at low price,"The cable looks gold plated and everything works. The picture quality is about the same as those sold at >$10 in local stores. The only problem is that I had to wait from the lowest-bid seller. For an experiment, I placed two orders at the same time: one from Importer52 and another one from SF Planet. SP Planet underbid Importer52 by one penny. Both had no shipping cost. The item from Importer52, as always, came within 4 days from the time I placed the order. But the one from SF Planet took a week. So, if you can wait for a few more days in order to save one penny, go ahead with the lowest bid."
1,Don't waste your time,"Purchased this item a few weeks ago, got it in the mail last weekend. Plugged it into my 32"" LCD TV and was greeted with a purple image that quickly went black. Was able to get a signal for a few seconds but each time I tried it was extremely purple.Thought that maybe it was the Cable box so I connected it to my laptop, couldn't even get a signal from the TV through the cable when I did that. When back to my old tiny 2 foot cable and everything is working fine. Won't be wasting my time on this product again."
5,are you kidding me??,"I'm not a technofile, but all I know is this cable works just fine. No issues at all, and for the price its a steal. I've had it for about 2 months and no issues whatsoever."
2,Great...but for how long,"Bought this great HDMI cable for a really cheap price, great right! not quite....after nearly a year it is not working properly, sometimes the picture comes up and you have to move the cable just right to get it to work. Otherwise everything else is great"
1,Product doesn't match picture,"Product is two large HDMI ends. I wanted an HDMI to go from smartphone to computer - product will not do this! Picture shows one large (computer), on small (smartphone) end, which is NOT what I received."
1,Worked for 30 minutes,"Worked for about the first 30 minutes, and then stopped working. At first I thought it was my laptop or my TV but after testing this cable with several TV's it's definately the cable."
1,became flaky within a month,"HDMI cables should not cost as much as monster cables - the gold tipped ends do nothing for digital signals. No need to go for high end, just get inexpensive ones. However, I see why this particular batch was lowered all the way down to less than $2. It worked for a couple of weeks, but now it either flickers or has digital artifacts on the screen. At less than $2, though, it's not even worth trying to return."
1,Junk,"I ordered the fast shipping for this item and did not receive it in the time specified. Once I got the cables and spent the time hooking thinks up, the cables did not work. Will cost me more to return then the cables are worth. Don't bother with this item."
3,Value for money HDMI,"I did not have any problem with these; however, expensive cables show mover crispier image that this one ! Good on sounds also."
5,Great Price,Great HDMI cable for the money. Don't be fooled by the more expensive hdmi cables that are claiming to be the best. These are just as good and will make any HD video look amazing. I got these so I can connect my laptop to my hdtv and it works very well. You will be satisfied with this purchase.
2,The Str-8-man,"Worked OK for the first couple weeks then it blew out my HDMI connections on my new 52in LCD TV. During service with Sony they believe the cable was not of sufficient capability to provide high enough strength to power the unit which made the HDMI circuit fail and had to reset the system. Replaced with higher quality and strength cable and everything so far is fine. The old addage is true, ""You get what you pay for"""
4,Good purchase,"Hi, this is an excelent way to connect your electronic device to your FULL HD TV. I bought three DVI Gear HDMI cable. My good feed to the seller."
1,Garbage Product,"If you enjoy watching Hi-Def video with static, this product is for you. Complete garbage. I wanted to replace my long HDMI cable (which worked perfectly, by the way) with a shorter one and figured at the price, this would work just as well (as is normally the case with AV cables). Well, this cable is certainly shorter than my other one, but the picture had a ton of static. Replaced it with my other HDMI cable and the static is gone. Don't buy this product."
3,Kind of chincy,"I don't know much about electronics, my husband did not want to pass up such a great deal on these little buggers. They are chincy but will do the job, and for the price, he couldn't pass them up"
2,You get what you pay for,One of the cables was defective. Maybe I received some lemons but will advice to spend a little more for a better quality product
4,Bought a few of them. No problems so far.,"I bought a handful of these back before Christmas, they arrived in a timely fashion, and all of them have worked as advertised. I'm sure there are better products out there for a comparable prices, but for this price, even if you get a lemon there isn't a whole lot to complain about."
1,dont buy,"the burniout life on these thin and very cheap hdmi cords are not that long 2 outta 3 of the cords i ordered died\burnt out, if your gonna get this product might as well get 10 at a time"
1,Threw It Out!,"I needed a cable with the new monitor I purchased, and it was listed as a recommended addition.IT DID NOT WORK BETWEEN MY PC AND NEW MONITOR.I swapped it with an HDMI cable I used between my cable box and my TV. My old cable worked perfectly between my PC and new monitor.This new cable sort of worked between my box and TV, BUT the screen was sprinkled with little white dots. Obviously the cable was not up to spec. I scrounged another HDMI cable, and it got rid of the white sprinkles.For a buck+ it wasn't worth returning, so I threw it away."
5,"It works, incredible price.","It's amazing how cheap you can get these for on here considering when you go to Walmart you can expect to be charged at least $25 to $60... Great cable, works perfectly and does what it's supposed to do."
1,you get what you pay for,"Who would not order with the postage higher then the product. However when it does not work what did you get? Yes I know you are all correct, you get what youpay for. It seems to be happening alot when ordering the to good to be true stuff . Order from someone that has good ratings and you see from reviews their items work."
5,Good and cheap,This HDMI cable is just as good as the $65.00 one at best buy or the $25.00 one at sams club and far better than the piece of crap direct tv gives you.
5,Best Deal,I don't usually write reviews but this is a really good deal and the quality is amazing I plugged it in to the my PS3 and the sound and picture was the best if I were to buy something like this at best buy it would have cost me 30 - 150 dollars. would recommend to anyone.
1,Cheap.,"The $1.60 I spent on this product says a lot about it's quality. The video is ok but the sound is crackly. At least It was cheap so that I don't regret the purchase too much, but I won't be using this product."
5,Price and quality,I bought four of the HDMI cables from Amazon for the price originally but I figured how could I go wrong for one cent each plus 1.50 shipping each but I received quality cables and fast shipping. Very happy with the purchase.
2,Flickers at 1080p,"I usually buyAmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] but I needed something cheap and quick. I used this cable on my PS3. It works flawlessly when running the game at 720p, but when it hits the main screen at 1080p, screen would go into a constant flicker because TV has trouble with the signal. This has never happened before with the other cable."
2,What did I expect for a few bucks?,You get what you pay for. The shipping was fine but the cord has to set just a certain way for my tv to pickup the signal from my xbox. I tried moving it to another system to see if it was a problem with the cord or not and it turns out it was. Not too bad for just a few bucks but I would have paid a few more to not have to mess with the cord so much to get it to work.
4,Worth the money,I have bought an hdmi cable from other stores and paid alot more money for them. This hdmi cable was ridiculously low priced but works just as good as the high price ones. I have had no problems with it so far. Would buy another one if and when I need one.
4,finally a decent price for HDMI . . .,"I've been looking for realistic pricing on (HDMI) wiring. whew . . . this is the first time I didn't wince when I saw the pricing. Upon delivery, I plugged it in and the dvd player played."
5,Great HDMI cable,"This HDMI cable works just as great as the one I purchased at walmart for $23.00. It took a couple weeks for me to get it for some reason, but was a great buy in the end."
