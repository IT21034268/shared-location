4,Handy and durable,"A friend recommended this map, as she had used one for a trip to London. So we bought it and found it handy as we navigated around the city. With both street and Tube maps, conveniently sized, light weight, and durable, it was the only map we needed as we toured the sights."
4,Good. Just good.,"Great item, perfectly suited needs. Sent to someone coming to visit London so they could get it in their heads where things were. To be totally honest the London A-Z is better, but as it's the standard among locals I guess that's to be expected.Good item, no worries about it. I'd buy it again. x"
4,In the Tube..,"I must say that this lil map of London is very good. So far I am mapping out a lot of places and things and actually found where I will be staying when I get there. :-) It is simply great, and is laminated, so it won't get dirty, bent out of shape or anything. Simply perfect!"
2,Not For Seniors,"Too small print for our senior eyes. To be useful, we would have to carry a magnifying glass. We will print certain locations from the internet."
5,Cannot be beat!,Streetwise maps are great for those that enjoy walking - they are easy to use and follow; highly recommend them!
4,HOW TO SAVE MONEY ON ATTORNEY FEES,"Over the years there have been many books written and used by attorneys as mere vanity projects or publicity tools. This is not one of them. In fact, there is nothing self-serving about this book at all. It concisely answers the majority of questions that a new or marginally experienced music artist would typically ask an attorney. It's formatted in a logical, easy to follow sequence and categorized by topic. It makes a nice quick reference guide."
4,Useful book!,"As a singer-songwriter managing a first band, I turned to Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, and the lawyer I spoke with recommended this to me. The read is easy and I really appreciated the form samples, and intend to use them. This book helped ease my apprehensions about how to manage the band."
5,Indispensable if You have a Band,"I got this book for my younger brother who is in a semi successful band. I say semi successful, because they get gigs, but don't have a recording contract. After browsing through this book, I can't see how a band, any band, can survive without the knowledge here.I know Chris, my younger brother, can hardly believe he gets paid for doing what he loves, but someday, some clean cut, cigar smoking guy in a suit, if Chris and his band are successful, will be in a position to take advantage of him. He'll do it, take advantage of my little brother, because the music business is just that, a business. And if you're going into business, it's best to understand the rules of the game. This book will give you the rules and it'll help you from getting run over, chewed up and spit out by the suits."
4,helpful,This is a pretty straight forward book. Non intimidating legal information that musicians can put to use.
5,Practical and useful resource for the professional musician,"Every NOLO book I've read has delivered what it said it would. This book does the same. There are no arcane insights into a bunch of legal hypotheticals here. All that's in this book is a collection of very solid and useful advice. It is certainly not the be all or end all, but it is a great starting point for figuring out how to make your way in a notoriously predatory business, getting screwed over or ripped off as little as possible. A must for the aspiring or neophyte professional musician!"
3,GOOD TO THE LAST BODY,"This was a good movie. It was oversaturated with murder though. To many murders dilute the emphasis of each in this genre. The movie could have made us feel more for two or three of the victims by letting us get to know them. It only did this once with the boyfriend of the younger sister. His not being an indescriminate sex addict, by jumping into bed with her before knowing her last name was a refreshing turn, since usually men in most films are portrayed as sex-mad immature hormones. This movie was worth the money. The ending was good as well with a refreshing twist. The characters of the gossip magazine editor and her husband served absolutely no purpose at all in this movie. It also would have added to the movie if the sisters had found one of the guys who assaulted them when they were younger and tortured and killed him. All in alla good movie."
5,Women gone crazy!,"I didn't expect much before I put this movie on, but once it started, I couldn't get my eyes off the screen. Theresa Lynn and J.J. North are great in the roles of the crazy sisters. They murder everybody! I also loved the locations for the movie and even the car the sisters drive is an old 50's Pontiac! The director is top notch. Don't wait, put your little fingers on that keyboard and order this masterpiece. You won't regret it."
1,WHOA GOODER THAN TITANIC,"THIS WAS A GOODER MOVIE! THIS MOVIE WAS GOODER THAN TITANIC CAUSE IT HAD GOODER EFFECTS. I LOVE THE PART WHERE THE GOODER SISTER CRIES ABOUT THE NOT SO GOODER SISER. I MEAN THIS MOVIE IS SOOO MUCH GOODER THAN THAT ONE MOVIE. YOU KNOW THE, ONE WITH THE GORILLA...THAT ONE WAS NOT GO GOODER. I CRIED AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE, IT WAS SO SAD. I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A HEARTWARMING, MOVIE AND IT WAS GOODER BECAUSE THE GIRL DID NOT HAVE HEAD LICE. THAT IS GOOD. SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU WANT TO BUT I MUST WARN YOU: FOR GOD'S SAKE BUY SOME KLEENEX FIRST CAUSE YOU WILL USE THE WHOLE BOX ON THIS FILM. THAT ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION REGARDING THIS MATTER."
4,Definite Must Have For Any John Cena Fan,"I could ramble on and on about what is contained inside the DVDs or Blue Ray. However, my opinion of this product is that its worth the cost. Although there is always room for improvement and matches they could have added like his title match against Brock Lesnar. I can not wait for the next Blue Ray/DVD to review John Cena's career and include his feud with The Rock."
3,John Cena Experience,"What hasn't already been said about John Cena? The man has virtually done it all and this DVD gives you a chance to see how hectic his day to day schedule really is. For all the crap he gets from the WWE Universe about being a poor wrestler, he sure does go through an awful lot to try and make all of us fans happy. He's on tv, he's in parades, he's flipping coins at football games, he's granting wishes, he's making music, he's signing thousands of autographs in one sitting, he's entertaining us every week on RAW. John Cena is like a machine the way that he works. I only wish he was as good in the ring as he is out of the ring. That's the only reason why Cena receives so much hate. His matches come off as stale and boring because of his lack of in-ring manuevers. All in all I thought this was a good set. If your a fan of the backstage aspect of wrestling then I suggest picking this up. There are some pretty good matches on here as well. I had a good time watching this."
2,John Cena outside of the WWE,"If you want to see what John Cena does besides wrestling then you need to see this. I didn't know that and watch it. I thought it was his life and how he got to the WWE, but it's not. It just a bunch of things that John does outside of the WWE. This thing is 2 hours long! And, I found it boring to watch after an hour or so. The John Cena Experience doesn't have any matches until almost till the end of the movie and that's for less than a minute. Just warning everyone that wants to see more about John in the ring, you do not want to get or watch this at all!"
5,Favorite Wrestler,"John Cena is our favorite wrestler (my 3 sons and I) and they wanted this DVD set for Christmas but when I went back to the store to get it, they were sold out. I called around and no where seemed to have it in stock but I founf it on Amazon. Kids and I love it and we love John Cena."
2,Worst Ever?,"I got to tell you people, this is the worst DVD ever put out by the WWE. And I can say that because I own almost all of them. I would have given it 1 star except some of the matches were OK. The documentary part was totally awfull. All it shows is Cena going to car shows, doing radio shows, and other garbage to fill up the DVD. Trust me when I say don't waste your time or money on this crap. Worst Ever?......I think so. C'mon WWE you can do better than this."
5,Smooth and Effortless Power,"There are many subwoofers on the market that can enhance an explosion, but very few indeed that also sound pure and musical. This sub makes me feel like I'm in the club with the performers when I'm listening to Jazz. Rock music is live and vital. And movies - wow! The beautiful wood finish doesn't hurt either. This sub rocks."
4,ROOF INTERNATIONAL COMPILATION (1982),Twelve tracks:* A Who Seh Me Dun (CUTTY RANKS)* Jordan River (MAX ROMEO)* True Confession (TYRONE TAYLOR)* Falling In Love (ANTHONY MALVO)* Weeping Willow (MICKEY SIMPSON)* Love And Cherrish (POWERMAN)* King Moses (GARNET SILK)* Start Loving Again (JACK RADICS)* Ban In A Yard (DADDY LIZARD)* Stand By Me (JUNIOR MERVIN)* Farmer Man (SINGING BRADY)* More Love In Your Heart (KULCHA KNOX)
1,$300 for a kindle book? are you insane?,I find it hard to believe anyone would pay $300 for a digital version of poems that can be found on a thousand websites for free. I have to believe that whomever posted this version for sale at such a ridiculously high price must be insane.
4,More black and white footage from the vaults!,"The Mozart and Bruch are among the most romantic concertos in the entire repitoire and I like Menuhin for the mushy stuff and not so much for the virtuoso stuff. He has the elegance of Kreisler but not so much the demonic technique of Heifetz, Rabin, or Kogan. I do consider this video worthwhile.DVD includes:Beethoven Concerto with Colin Davis (1962)Mozart 3 directed by Menuhin (1967)Bruch 1 with Fricsay (1961)Beethoven Romance in F with Adrian Boult (1966)As far as I know these are the only videos you can get of the Mozart and Bruch, an invaluable study aide if you are a violinist..."
3,Too dated,"Although I love all 3 concertos the quality of DVD is old, of course this could not be helped as it was copied from the early 1960s concerts. Menuhin performance is spectactular. If you don't object to dated black & white film then by all means add it to your collection!"
1,no sound,"i ordered 2 CD's - one to replace the other. Neither had sound on either my Bose accoustical wave, or my Bose radio/CD player.Could both have been faulty? not trying a 3rd time. amazon was very good on crediting me, an excellent process and easy for the customer."
3,Toward a Ruined Bridge,"People are traveling on a train toward a ruined bridge in this long story or short novel (whichever it is) by one of Russia's top writers, Victor Pelevin. I won't give away the plot. Suffice it to say that the whole story is an allegory about life in the post-Soviet Russia. The story is pessimistic with melodramatic overtones in the end. I don't know what the conclusion of this story means and would like to find out. What I take from the whole book is that Russia is racing towards something indefinite, which may not be so great a destination when it is finally reached. Is this a new spin on Gogol's troika? I do recommend this book, however. It takes you a little bit inside the ""Russian soul,"" it gives you a sense of the pessimism of the 1990s Russia, and it is concise and easy to read."
4,cheaper locally,"Just so you know, you can usually get this at your local bodega or Mexican grocery store for less than half the price. I'm like 1500 miles from Mexico and I can still find it locally."
1,Don't buy it!,"The Coca-Cola company contributed $1,700,500 to defeat the California Prop 37 also known as ""The California Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act."". Do you really want to buy from a company that does not want you to know that GMO is in your food?"
2,Way to high !!!!!!!!!!! Price,"I was just in Houston Texas and found these bottle for $1.29 each. The prices on Amazon are way to high.I was there the first week of May, 2010They want double the price here. Talk about making a killing !!!!!!!!!"
2,Another type is better,This product can put a dent in your wood. I prefer the hinge pin that goes in to the hole of the hinge.
5,Best book to learn grammar,"I taught high-school Spanish for 5 years and this was my go-to textbook of choice. Simple, clear explanations and provides numerous examples with each exercise to reinforce learning. I would highly recommend for anyone looking to improve grammar for use in professional setting."
4,Good book for a particular style of learning,"If you're the kind of guitarist who likes books full of scales and chords to study, this is definitely for you. It consists mostly of page after page of carefully voice-led chord sequences, following the important ii-V-I variations and explaining other types of changes as well. It's great for drills. However, as a theory book it's not particularly deep. If you're familiar with Mick Goodrick's ""The Advancing Guitarist"", this book is almost the exact opposite. Goodrick forces you to think to get anything at all from his lessons. This book invites you to turn off thinking and start memorizing. Both are valid, useful approaches."
3,Great theory - beware of print errors,"This book has some great examples and exercises for the developing guitarist. But beware: I began finding errors beginning on page 3. Specifically the suggested left hand fingerings, which seem to have been mixed around with fingerings attached to the wrong voicing."
4,1,"A thoughtful and well organized presentation of extended chords as they apply to guitar, without the same dry garble that many other books contain."
2,What a horrible disappointment. Don't waste your money.,"I'm a huge Annie Lennox fan, and after hearing all the critical hype for this album I couldn't wait to hear it. I downloaded it...first thing this morning, and BOY was I disappointed. I feel completely [disappointed].If you're expecting the brilliant songwriting that showed itself on ""Diva"" 11 years ago, curb your expectations. I was hard-pressed to find even 2 singable songs on this album. There's nothing special here -- nothing gut-wrenching or moving, nothing that shows an evolution of Annie's talents and abilities since ""Diva.""If you need an Annie Lennox fix, I would skip this purchase and dust off your old copy of ""Diva."" Much better album."
5,Nothing Bare about the vocals on this CD,"Annie Lenox does it again. Thought provoking and deeply felt music with her amazing vocals. Her voice is rich and mature and brings so much to the music she has writen for this CD. I have always been a fan, all the way back to Sweet Dreams, and I still cannot get enough of this great DIVA!!! Honestly, Loneliness, and A Thousaand Beautiful Things are stand out songs on the CD."
5,The true meaning of a DIVA,"Since I was a kid, I was used to listening my mother singing ""Sweet Dreams"". In that time, I really didn't know the influence Eurithymics had in contemporary music. Later on, I started to take an interest in Annie Lennox's solo albums, my favourite until ""Bare"" arrived was ""Diva"". Who will ever forget the video and the catchy song ""Walking on Broken Glass""?This new release its a true gift from Annie, she talks about intimate matters in a perfect and soothing way.You know when you buy a CD and you have to skip those tedious songs? This CD you simply can't do that because each song moves you in an unexpected way. My favourites are Pavement Cracks (so Annie) and Erased which awakened feelings I didn't know I had inside of me.This is a must buy and with the special DVD, you can understand every single song through the delicious interview she gave."
5,"Oh, god!","Annie Lennox wrote this song, Oh, God!, for me to listen to, at night.Late, very late; when everyone is asleep and I, usually, have but my conscience to listen to. She wrote it, so this 44-year old man would find both the right words and the right voice.I shouldn't be surprised. After all, it is a prayer. It's just that... I'd never, before, not till I heard this song, considered praying..."
5,Just wonderful!,"There are no other words for it. It's touching and passionate. Great voice, great music and lyrics.Annie brings us an oasis of pure talent. I am glad she is back, and I hope she is back to stay."
5,Bare,This is by far one of the best albums I own from start to finish. After 11 years her voice and lyrics still touch you in a way only Annie Lennox can. Each song is very personal and it resonates in her emotion. Her long anticipated album that her fans have waited many years for has blown me away.
2,SoulJammers Lack Jam!,"I purchased the 1st Soul Jam about 3 months ago and was so impressed by the performances i logged onto amazon and ordered number 2 soon after.What a differance half a concert makes.Most of the guys in the Dramatics seem ready to keel over at any moment and all seemed to have lost there voices.Cuba Gooding absolutely destroys Everybody Plays The Fool as he is every bit a fool on this one.As for the rest of the performance all lack the bravado and energy of the 1st C.D.Why is this one night show split into 3 D.V.D.'S.I'll tell u why,money,mulla,cashola.This could easily have been on one disc as all the top hits are on the 1st and best of the 3 D.V.D's so save your money and just pick up the 1st one."
4,Jw of B-more,"Upon receiveing this Dvd I placed it in my player and sat back to watch it.I was impressed with the performance of each group.I thought By purchasing This Dvd Without any other reviews that I would see Such entertainers as Skip mahoney & the Casuals,Black Ivory,Ebonys Some of the less Popular groups of the 70'sThis Dvd contains.Stylistics, Dramatics,Chi-lites,Delphonics,Harold Melvins's Bluenotes & cuba Gooding Jr.This dvd should included a history of each group as extra."
5,FOR MY DAD: PART #2,"I didn't listen to this myself, it was a purchase for my father who seems to love it. If he likes it I love it"
5,great resource!,"I played ultimate in college and was looking to get a team together here in san diego. This book helped refresh my memory on basic rules/strategies and also offered lots of new insight into the finer points of the game. Very easy to understand, lots of helpful photos and diagrams throughout. This guy definitely knows his stuff!"
2,for absolute beginners only,"i wouldn't recommend this book to any frisbee player,who's playing in a team,the lack of lessons and drills was disappointing,if you browse the web for informations about ultimate,you get ten times more input then this book is able to give,so if you choose this book,be aware that it's just giving an oversight,but no interesting infos for more advanced players."
4,Time for Fiction,"In our busy lives sometimes the characters in fiction books are the ones we think about more than our clients. To unwind and watch characters in a story until you start wondering ""What will they do?"" and calm yourself with the thought of your evening reading ""I'll find out tonight"" is always a good sign of a good book."
4,A good start.,"After leaving Philadelphia International Records circa 1988, The O'Jays signed with Capitol Records and released this fine if somewhat dated album. ""Out Of My Mind"", ""Rainbow"" and the timeless ""Have You Had Your Love Today"" are real pluses but all the other songs pale in comparison to most of their majestic PIR recordings of yesteryear."
5,The Missing Maitland-Luke and Blossom-SPOILERS,favorite scene with blossom-telling her boss she's taking time off.favorite scene with luke-his talk with his aunt.favorite scene together-when he returns to her apartment and tells her he loves her.
5,The best,"I own the edge audio 5.1 system and it produces fabulous sound from these beautiful speakers. This system is competitive with systems costing about $1000 more. This may be the best audio system for the price on the market right now. Note that these speakers are heavy so if you are going to use stands get ones that are rated for their weight. They also have 5-way binding posts, something not usually found on speakers at this price."
4,"Very good series, though short","Definitely a very memorable series overall. There is action to be found in Ex-driver, but don't watch it looking for a body count. The animation for the cars, characters, and scenery are very well done, and the voice dubbing isn't too bad either. The story could have used a little more developing, and I feel that they might have been better off making it into a 2 hour movie rather than 6 25 minute episodes. I watched the series by renting it, and I plan to buy the set when it comes out. It's a great buy, and a must for anyone that's into anime and cars."
4,Good for car fans,"This is a nice little 6 episode OAV which takes place in the future where nobody knows how to drive and all the cars are computerized, save for the eX-Driver organization. Occasionally, these computer controlled cars will go out of control, and these eX-Drives exsist to stop these vehicles using their fule powered vehicles, special driving techniques, and various equipment. The storyline is decent and the animation is okay although occasionally the vehicle animation can be a bit dodgy. The last 3 episodes developes a deeper storyline as it progresses and previous members are revealed. But if you are a fan of cars (all fule powered cars are modled from actual vehicles and even use sound bytes taken from them), then you should find this DVD to be entertaining."
4,Great 3rd party replica,This is a great 3rd party replica of the original Lenovo part. I have no problem hot-swapping my DVD burner and this HDD caddy. Well worth the money.
2,"Not the real deal, OK copy","The good news it seems to work OK in my IBM T60. The bad news, as others have commented, this is a misleading product. The description says its made by Lenovo it is not. The label on the fake product is a very poor copy of a IBM PATA hard drive bay adapter. My genuine IBM PATA hard drive adapter has a FRU P/N of 62P4553. The same P/N on the fake SATA bay adapter, not the 40Y8725 P/N called out in the product description. I purchased this fake product because other people have had good luck with it working. Just be warned that the product description is very misleading."
2,Not hot-swappable - a downgrade from the PATA bay,"I have used the bay adapter for backups on all of my previous Thinkpads, from the T20 on up. Each of these was hot-swappable - you could remove the optical drive and insert the adapter while the machine was running and it would work just fine.As confirmed by IBM/Lenovo tech support, this new adapter does not support hot-swap functionality on my brand new T61 - talk about a step backwards! If you don't need the hard drive physically inside the machine, you'd be better off with a portable USB 2.0 external drive as they can be added and removed at will.Get with the program, Lenovo!"
2,"This is NOT a Lenovo part, despite the ""by Lenovo"" in the listing","I was interested in this item as the Lenovo part is much more expensive. I contacted the seller, and they said:""Sir:Hi. It is an aftermarket caddy. It is not genuine but it has the specifications of an OEM caddy. Some of the buyers purchased this caddy just to find out that it is not compatible with their laptop model. It is better if they send us message (give their laptop model) before buying because it might not be the one they need. Thank you.Syrah""It may be a fine item, but the listing has the Lenovo part number and says ""by Lenovo"", which seems misleading."
2,does not fit T420,"Part received does not fit Lenovo Thinkpad T420. The connector on the adapter were it plugs into the computer is some sort of rectangular header, something unfamiliar, while the DVD ROM drive removed from the computer has a standard SATA header. It's impossible to tell this from the photo or description.Maybe it fits some other models. Just not T420. Would it hurt you, AMZ Tech, to list the compatible & incompatible models?0 stars for not working and unclear advertising. Other wise it looks ok. So average is 2.5 stars. Rounded down to 2."
1,Beware not compatible with ThinkPad W520,"Unfortunately I discovered while back home in Canada that the connector does not fit inside the Lenovo W520The connector should have a split of about 1/8"" so that it can slide insideSo now I am waiting to see what comes next.... :-("
2,Aftermarket!,"Feels cheap, definitely aftermarket despite 'by Lenovo' below the product name.Does not match the connector on any of my lenovo laptops T510, T500, T400 which have SATA interfaces and Ultrabay II / IIIPlease update the description with the compatible devices:ThinkPad R60 SeriesThinkPad T60 SeriesThinkPad X60 SeriesThinkPad Z60 SeriesThinkPad Z61 SeriesThinkPad Advanced Dock media bayThinkPad X6 Ultrabase media bayI'll try my T61 later this week, and update my review, but so far - this purchase was disappointing."
4,UnderGround HipHop is the Real HipHop !!,"If you've every complained about buying an album with only a few good tracks on it, your prayers have been answered. Prince Paul, Mos Def, Eminem, Common and more combine to make one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. The CD also returns the DJs to the for front.Top tracks include WWIII, 7XL, Patriotism, and Every Rhyme I Write."
5,You better be on your way to buying this disk.,"This album is one of the better ones of all times. It kind of gives you a taste of what can become of the underground hip hop scene. This cds for the newcomers in the underground genre. If you think you can hang, I SEVERLY recommend going to any lengths to pick up Volume 1....good luck finding it.PS. The hunt is far worth it!"
4,allstar hip hoppers unite,"Soundbombing Vol. 2 has a great flow to it, with interludes by the World Famous Beat Junkies. the emceeing is superb for the most part (although i'm not such a fan of RA the rugged man) and it brings an allstar cast of rappers together."
4,phattest compilation of da year,this album is blazin far and beyond any compilation this year..this disc puts the commercial ruff ryderz disc and any others to shame..the disc is banging from start to finish..the best way to tell if a disc is blazin if you don't have to skip any songs and i couldn't...the only reason i didn't give it that fifth star wuz because i wanted more tracks..this should have been a two disc joint on da real...its good to see catz like brand nubian rip mics with the new and upcoming emcees...the track with common and sadat x is the crispest track i have heard all year...let the commercial joints slide and pick this disc up... cocobrova3 aka chill will..hit me up at will3c@aol.com
5,BRILLIANT!,how on earth can any1 make such a good album..... it'z even bettah than dj morpheus PHAX & PHIXON... and that wuz da best!
1,I bouth the wrong toy.,"I thoug it works with leappad, but for my surprise it works with leap books. How I live abroad, I Couldnt see it working. But the sell and the deliver was great."
5,"AMAZING FUN... She ASKED everyday to play ""LEARN!""","This talking book comes with an interactive ""magic pen"" that works like a hand-held computer mouse pointer. Children can opt to turn the paper pages and listen to the story read with different voices for each character. Or they can interrupt the read-aloud session to play with the magic pen (permanently attached with a wire). They can point the pen tip to any word on a page and hear it pronounced, or touch a picture and hear a sound effect (such as ""Strike one!"" for the baseball bat). Very similar to the popular Living Books computer games, this 10-by-11-inch book is more portable than a home computer.DO NOT EVEN THINK NOT TO GET IT :)SOOOO INEXPENSIVE AND WOW ---- YOU GET FREE-TIME TO SIT TOO ;) <3WHILE CHILD IS LEARNING IN A WAY I WISH WE ALL HAD GOTTEN TOO!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ HAVE FUN!"
1,jittery and awful,"The product discription and picture give an impression of a tranquil winter snow scene. There is little of that. Most of it is herky-jerky vertigo-inducing helicopter views that constantly jump and jitter from one shot to the next. The transitions are far, far too frequent and very jarring and abrupt. We are also 'treated' to many shots of another helicopter. Why they thought this would be enjoyable is a complete mystery to me, likewise the intrusive bands of skiers that pop up hither thither at random. Overall I truly detest this dvd and will be giving it away to Goodwill or somesuch. Further there is no option to simply hear the wind. All soundtracks are various blah renditions of music as listed in another review. Overall this dvd is a complete waste of money, unless perhaps you want to pretend you are hang-gliding while bouncing in and out of consciousness. ;-)"
3,light duty protection,"the fabric is thin, and the seams are not strong. I generally wear size medium and this worked for me. My helper who is a large/extra large tore his on the first time entering a crawlspace. Buy at least 1 size larger than you'll need. I use a couple times then have to discard - but - better than nothing!"
3,Sweet soul sounds from Peabo.,"Peabo Bryson deservedly scored a #1 R&B hit with his glorious remake of Al Wilson's classic hit ""Show And Tell"". Other highlights of this CD are ""Life Goes On"", ""When You're In Love"", ""True Love"", ""One Time For The Lonely"" and the title track. This CD's production values and overall approach are very similar to those of his '70s Capitol releases."
2,Lots of info... very poorly organized horrible index,"I hate this book, lots of potential here, lots of content, but the author or whoever... did a poor, poor job with the indexing and content layout.Can't find anything you want when you need it. Definately not a good reference book unless you intend to go though the entire text."
2,"I wanted to like it, but just couldn't.....","I wanted to like this hat. Oh so badly. It is made very durable and looks professional. It DOES look very nice, but it didn't work for my son. The elastic upset him and he would cry the minute I got it partially on (this is coming from a child who has had no trouble or issues with hats, he wears them daily). I was able to take one picture of him with it before he ripped it off, and then had to console him afterwards. I even tried letting him ""get used to it"" before the party, for a week. NADA. He preferred the cheaply made store bought one with the elastic band, cardboard and faux blue fur."
5,Love this hat!,This was the hit of the party when my daughter turned 1 and made for some great pics! She likes to wear hats so didn't bother her but if yours doesn't like hats may not be the best as is a little pinchy with the elastic around the rim and we took it off her after a short bit as was leaving a mark on her forehead. Very cute!!!
5,Cute Hat,"I bought it for my son first Birthday, everybody in the party loved it.Good size not too small not too big just perfect size"
5,Great product!,"Great product - it looked fabulous on my son and we all had fun with it. It is made very well, you can clean it easily and even thought it is not a necessity for your child`s first birthday, it does makes it a lot more fun and looks great on your special family photos :- )"
3,Ok,I obtained this book via inter-library loan. Who can afford these exorbitant prices? The book was good for determining the type of tests and the value of the results. Most can be found via wikipedia.
2,WEALTH OF MATERIAL OVERSHADOWED BY LONG-OBSOLETED MASTERING,"This compilation, first mastered and issued in 1990, has long since been supplanted by several superior remastered compilations.The best audio is resident on the 2005Essential Collection. The same audio is also on the now-OOP 2002Classic MastersCD.Essential has 15 tracks to Classic's 12, but Classic has the 6 minute version of ""Total Control"" (a great early track), where Essential carries the shorter single edit.There are six tracks on ""No Vacancy"" that do not appear on these two recent compilations (8, 9, 13, 15, 16 & 17).Both of these compilations also have superior mastering to the 1999 ""All For One"" Expanded Edition.So, while No Vacancy has more material than the more recent compilations, the sound quality of the newer discs is much more enjoyable."
3,Overly Generous Anthology Album,"With a brief radio heyday in the first half of the 1980s, The Motels were the ultimate singles band. I say that because once you get past the four or five obvious hits contained in ""No Vacancy,"" the rest of the material (19 songs in all) is pretty much unlistenable. Lead singer Martha Davis's sultry voice and some strong hooks deservedly propelled ""Only the Lonely,"" ""Suddenly Last Summer,"" and ""Remember the Nights"" high onto the singles chart. They still sound fresh today, and are quite delightful taken on their own. Most of the non-hits, however are interchangeable and bland. Particularly bad are the four songs from the band's 1985 album ""Shock,"" in the wake of which they quickly faded into oblivion.Overall, an overlong anthology albumfrom a band that enjoyed a very brief time in the spotlight."
3,"Good ""best of...""","Chp Davis don't have any new complete record, from FA8 (it doesn't include the summer song and bird song records, most ambient than music. This one is onlya a compilation, if you have a FA and Chip collection, don't buy it. If you don't have any, buy it, is good.1. Serenity: Impressions2. Sunday Morning Breeze: Sunday Morning Coffe II3.

3,disapointing for great Mannheim,"I have a lot of the Mannheim Steamroller CDs. I enjoy them greatly, however, this CD was disapointing. Instead of feeling in a romantic mood, it made me sad. Although, I still love the group, and will continue to buy their CDs, this one I would recommend passing up if you want a romantic evening. If you just like music for the sake of music, it is a great album."
3,romantic melodies,"it be honest i haven't listened to it yet, but Mannheim Steamroller is very good, so i am sure i will enjoy it."
4,NICE>>.,"I like this album. I bought it recently and I found it to be very pleasing. If I HAD to choose though, it wouldn't be my #1 album. REally, I think Zade is far more important an artist and his music really shows it. But still.. a good album."
1,Don't Buy This Machine,"Well I guess you can say I am lucky... I have had this machine for a year and a half. Similar to two other reviews, today the CD stopped working. No reason. No weird sounds. A week ago it worked and today it doesn't. Just flashes No Disc and won't play anything. Priced at $169-199 CDN, I expected a lot more than this from a Sony product"
3,Easy fix for GX250,"I recently repaired a GX250 that refused to turn on (flashing power led), and apparently this fix works for most other problems too, including ""no disc"" errors and no sound output.What you need to do is clean and reseat the (widest) white ribbon connector that connects the front panel to the large circuit board on the side. To get to the connector, you'll have to take off the sides and the top, and then unscrew the cd tray so you can lift it up and get your arm and hand in far enough to reach the connector from the opposite side. Then unplug the ribbon cable, blow the connector out with some compressed air, and plug it back in firmly."
1,Garbage,"I purchased this product on July 30, 2005. Exactly 2 months to the day the entire system stopped working. The only thing this system is doing is showing the display. Nothing more. Dummy me, I also purchased the same product two stereo systems prior, didn't remember, that one lasted 6 months. Anyone who is even considering purchasing this product FORGET IT. You will get little help from Sony or the store you may have purchased it from. Run as fast as you can to another system. I must add that I did not purchase this through Amazon, so don't hold anything against them."
5,7 years later and loving it,"I bought this Stereo on 06/19/04 (I have the original receipt from Best Buy with me) along with a 2 year limited warranty. It's been 7 years and the stereo still works great. I had 4 speakers hooked up for a while, and got rid of the 2 extra ones. I needed to clean my connections, but the two original speakers still sound and work great. This is a purchase I have never once regretted and I'm glad I bought it."
1,JUNK,Within 9 months of buying this system the CD Player stopped working.......So far I have gotten no help from Sony
2,Disappointed,"First thing---- i like Sony Products. This product disappointed me. Sound output seemed less at home than in the store. The CD Turn table developed a very pronounced ""creaking"" that was louder than the sound output.Will replace the unit with something----not Sony. Disappointed."
5,Great idea and great toy!! A must for any bug lover!!!,"I was worried after reading some of the reviews, but my daughter used her own money from her 6th birthday to get his and we found the suction was just fine. You must have the magnifying ""door"" open - maybe that was the problem for the others, but we have captured pill bugs, ants spiders and even a fly with no problem and I expect we will be sucking up bugs all summer!!"
1,Very weak suction,"The vacuum is too weak to pick up almost anything heavier than a stationary moth. Even then, you have to get the moth almost all the way into the tube entrance before it gets sucked into the observation chamber. You're certainly not going to be able to grab a hovering fly with it. It has 3 speed settings, but even the fastest is just too weak to be useful. There is also no reverse, so if you think you're going to grab insects for feeding to a caged amphibian you're going to have a hard time getting them back out. There is more educational value in showing a child how something that looks neat in the store isn't so neat once they're home and trying to use it. Perhaps there is value if you removed the motor and hooked it up to a good quality shop vac... but then you're going to have to carry the motor around with you."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This is a piece of junk. It doesnt work, we couldnt even get it to vacuum up a piece of popcorn. There is no suction at all. It is just an expensive noise maker that falls apart easily. My son was so disappointed. He caught bugs fast and better with tweezers."
3,Not bad...customer service a downer so far,"My 3 & 5 yr old boys each received a vacuum for an Easter gift. They really have a lot of fun with them, even though they haven't actually caught bugs. But it's a thrill to suction hold bottle caps, plastic gold coins, or whatever they find, then drop the object into a cup! LOL! So, we haven't expirienced a problem with suction.About 2 months later, I noticed that the original batteries had leaked all over the inside battery compartment of one vacuums, corroding it beyond repair (all rusted out). I highly reccommend replacing those cheap original batteries with higher quality ones...toys work much better. Many manufacturers state this in the mannuals (whatever the toy).I contacted the company online regarding the leakage problem 2 weeks ago and i'm still waiting for a responce!I gave it 3 stars only because of the corrosion & customer service."
2,"Yep, it's only a toy alright!!","I actually had a practicle (non-toy) reason to buy this contraption.I feed crickets to my pets, and thought this could replace my lung poweredpooter to suck them up.First time trying, it would suck the crick about half way up, then drop it!!So, I made some modifications with rubber gaskets, hot glue, etc. to seal thenumerous air leaks, which made the vacuum more powerful X2, but still not enough.Anything bigger then about 1/4'', it will not suck up.Oh well, back to my home-made pooter!!!"
1,The Bug Vaccum DOES NOT VACCUM,"Bevees's review was very helpful. I read it before I purchased the TOY and I knew what to expect. So when my son opened his bug vaccum on Christmas day, and all it would suck up was the foam moth that came with it, I was not angry or disappointed."
1,IT DOESNT WORK,This toy doesn't work at all. Dissapointing!!! Maybe it can pick up a tiny mini winni mini mini mini dust crumb!!!
3,Relaxing read.,A little comedy here and there. A whodunnit that was a little too easy to solve. Just an easy read.
4,Good mystery,"I like reading books for enjoyment and to escape. I don't watch a lot of television so in the evening, I relax by reading. I thought the cover of these mysteries were cute and they looked like they would be fun. They really are. Light mysteries set in England. A very good way to pass an evening."
4,A pleasant diversion,"The plot was nicely complicated. I enjoyed this mystery very much. It's the first book I have read by Kate Kingsbury, andplan to read more now."
3,Comfortable British Cosy,"ROOM WITH A CLUE is a gentle, somewhat lightweight Edwardian historical featuring the recently widowed proprietor of a posh, seaside hotel.When one of her guests is found beneath a crumbled wall, Cecily Sinclair, is shocked but also worried about the financial implications for her livlihood. At first, the local constabulary is content to label the death accidental but Cecily and her manager (future love interest?) soon suspect one of the other guests is a calculating murderer.The murder isn't too hard to figure out, but the supporting cast is fairly strong and offers an upstairs/downstairs view of the early 20th century. A sub-plot involving an escaped python provides some chuckles.This is the first in a long series, so if you're looking for an enjoyable, quick read or are a fan of the Emily Brightwell books you might give this a try."
2,Too many clues and not enough substance to satisfy a serious reader,"Room With a Clue is a fairly predictable mystery.. If you want a quick read, this one will do the job."
3,"Good, Free Read","I enjoyed the story, though figuring out the murder didn't take too much brain power. It's a great little read with some interesting characters."
3,An interesting book,"This is a good book with interesting characters. While set in an earlier time, the story line is a little predictible. Still, it was a quick and fun read."
2,Sorry This Just Was Too Far Out There,I simply couldn't finish this book all the way. I love a good mystery but this was too far to the left for my taste. It was a fictional ghosty type of humor with a side of a mystery is my best description.
3,song,what was the music when drew berrymore was leaving out of charlies office. it sounds like a guitar and axylophone but i dont think its on thesoundtrack.
1,Not So Good....,I had hoped one of the songs on this soundtrack would have been the song from the fight near the end on the rooftop (trying to avoid spoilers). Does anyone know what song that is?Otherwise this soundtrack is random at best. Near half the songs in the movie are missing.
3,Awesome Tunes...but Missing some,"In addition to the comments already sent in, I think they also missed the Who's ""Who Are You"" a la the CSI scene. And another big miss for me is the Chemical Brothers tune Block Rockin' Beats. But I guess you can't fit all the tunes on one album. That's how good this soundtrack could have been. How about putting out a second, to also include My Sharona...."
2,My Sharona,"The Song you are looking for is My Sharona by The Knack, if I am not mistaken. Does anyone knows the song when Drew Barrymore is at the Bar in MExico??? I know is a 50 - 60's song but I can't find it. Thanks"
3,HELP PLEASE,"i've watched the movie trailer a 100 times, and there is a music that i can not find in the cd.If someone knows the music i am talking about, please help me out.It is a music with something about a motorcycle ... and a time cherona ... or time sure run out or something like that"
3,No Score?,The soundtrack is great but there are score tracks missing. Even in the first one they were missing the theme for the Creepy Thin Man.(Crispin Glover)
1,I would buy this if it was the actual sountrack,The Prodigy tracks made the movie soundtrack. Why are they not included?
2,More chillin' than thrillin',Good thing the movie had action 'cause the cd don't! If you're into soft rock from the 70's then this is your thing; otherwise keep your money. Very disappointing!
3,Will not buy missing roof fight scene song,Considered buying soundtrack but it does not have the Prodigy song Firestarter from the rooftop fight scene.
2,What?!,I was so excited for the soundtrack and there are none of the songs on there (well barely non) I need to know the names of the songs they missed. I got most of them but what\s the title of the white zombie song? Help...
2,Where is the Mexican bar song,"Sleep Walk, the September 21, 1959 #1 hit, not by the Ventures, as someone previously stated, but performed by the duo Santo and Johnny? Well? Huh? Huh? Maybe it was contractual, but man did the compilers miss the beat on this soundtrack. While the movie was pure escapism, I wanted to get up and dance throughout the entire film, I won't be dancing with this. Save your cash."
1,Rooftop scene - Chemical Brothers,"The rooftop scene song is ""Block Rocking Beats"" by the Chemical Brtohers from their album ""Dig Your Own Hole.""I must agree with many of the other reviewers: many of the best songs in the film are not on the soundtrack CD."
1,Action Movie - Where are the Action songs?,"50% of this movie is raw, high energy action.. In the theater, the action sequences are enhanced by the musical tracks selected to play along with it. Who ever put this album together left all the fun emotive songs from the movie out, especially the action tracks.The Bowie track is a jewel, but I must say, before the film was even over I thought to myself, ""This is going to be an awesome soundtrack"", but there is nothing but disappointment there.Hammer Time, Rebel Rebel, the Journey song and a few others were actually in the movie, but I don't think this track list is representative of the film at all.Very disappointed. Where are the Prodigy tracks and the other Action sequence tracks?"
3,missing some tracks,this soundtrack is missing two key songs from the movie. Rage Against the Machine's - sleep now in the fire (from the opening scene) and prodigy's - firestarter.
2,Where is the beautiful SCORE!???,"I bought the CD without really thinking! I didn't even see the track list at the back to see if the score was in. That was the original reason why I bought the CD and once I saw the track list I was really annoyed. How could this CD NOT include its beautiful score?The scene when Dylan decides to leave the girls has a brilliant musical piece that I can't simply find ANYWHERE! But anyway, I'm only giving this album 2/5 stars because of Pink's Feel Good Time and Edwyn's Girl Like You. But other than that, this album deserves NOTHING!"
1,Poser SoundTrack +Answer to White Zombie Question.,"First off I just wanna say that this is a poser soundtrack as the title to my review suggests. I think someone on here asked if the producer was crazy, well he wasn't crazy he just didnt want to insult the great bands that he left out; or he couldnt pay them enough money. In answer to the question of the White Zombie song that is not on the sound track the answer is ThunderKiss 65' Lata biatches."
2,in reply to an above comment,"""other favorites are track two which suprised me at how good it was considering it was a remake of an Elton John song""i find it hard to swallow that someone has said that. Elton John is one of the greatest musicians ever to step foot on this planet and your pretty much saying there that nickelback are better. grow a brain!"
1,What happened to CoCo Lee's track?,"Why did they put CoCo Lee's song ""All Around The World"" on Charlie's Angels soundtrack sold in Asia and not put her song in the American version? Doesn't make sense to me. I think everyone should listen to CoCo's song and see if they like it and buy the Asian import."
2,Many songs from trailers NOT here!!!,"I hate soundtracks that use cool songs on their trailers and then, when you buy the soundtrack you cannot find the song you liked ... this is the case with this soundtrack.Songs used on trailers NOT on the soundtrack:1.- The vines - Get free2.- The crystal method - ""wild, sweet and cool""3.- AC /DC - 2 songs that I have no idea what their names are.4. - Christina Aguilera - Fighter5.- Prodigy - Firestarterand probably there are more songs that I dont recall which are NOT on the soundtrack. You have been warned....The only song used in the trailers which is actually here is ""Feel Good time"" by Pink...the rest of the soundtrack is very average..."
4,It's missing something.....,"This soundtrack has some real classics like Mc Hammers ""U can't touch this"", Electric Six' ""Danger! High Voltage"" or even Bon Jovis ""Living on a prayer"".....BUT it's missing The Knacks ""My Sharona"" which was played in the trailers...The new songs especially recorded for the Soundtrack, which includes Pinks new video Feel Good Time"" are more average songs....Nevertheless it's worth buying even if you didn't like the movie...Thanks to the real ""Evergreens""!"
1,Is there a score release?,I am looking for the score release. There are great themes in this movie. I can't find them. Did anyone find any of these themes?
1,bad movie...all right tunes,This movie was really bad...I thought the first one was good but this was just stupid. Anyway half the music on this CD wasn't even in the movie...and if it was it wasn't necessary. There are other songs that should have been on this Soundtrack that weren't. Like the song that was playing when they were having that dirt bike race or whatever (btw it's Prodigy - Breathe)
1,Left Off Too Many of the Better Tracks,"The worst release of an OST that I have seen - inclusion of too many forgettable 1970s songs...perhaps because the better tracks would have required licensure? The only track of any significance is the Nickleback/Kid Rock cover of Elton John's ""Saturday Night"".Do not bother with this album."
2,No Haloes Here,"A sloppily organized soundtrack to a goofy movie, ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" incoherently mixes songs from assorted decades, genres and styles with no significant tie-ins. The first song, ""Feel Good Time"" by Pink with William orbit, is one star, the stripped down version of David Bowie doing ""Rebel Rebel"" gets the other.The rest is a mish-mash of 80's rock (Bon Jovi and Loverboy), pure cheese (Beach Boys, Andy Gibb), awful (Nas with Pharrell, Nickelback and Kid Rock doing a WTF cover of Elton John, and the awful Electric Six track). MC Hammer is good for a laugh, as Journey's ""Any Way You Want It"" is a side of Journey that doesn't get heard all that often. Otherwise, the only other track worth hearing over again is Edwyn Collins' magnificent one hit wonder, ""A Girl Like You."" ""Full Throttle"" is little more than a throwaway as music is concerned."
1,What happened to some of the tracks?,There are two scenes where I like the songs. First where Dylan is leaving the angels and it's this really pretty guitarish theme. Anyone know what it is? Also when Lucy liu and cameron diaz are chasing the marshall in the car and lucy attatches the thing on it with a luge. That was a cool technoish song. If you have any idea please email me at Vickyssecret113@aol.comThanks!
3,Answer to Mexican bar music question!,"The guitar song playing in Drew Barrymore's Mexican bar scene is ""Sleep Walk"" by The Ventures."
2,Who produced this soundtrack?,WHY PINK AND NAS and not Prodigy and rage against the machine??? What was wrong with the person who produced this soundtrack???
2,"Too many slow songs, missing the good stuff","This is not what I expected at all. When I saw the movie I heard White Zombie, Prodigy, several hard core songs that made the action sequences. The movie put a ton of great action songs together from a great time span. I am really disappointed to not get the collection that the movie and the trailers describe how the movie really was. They cut out half the action and left every slow part. Guess I'll have to create my own collection ..."
4,Pretty good..but......,"Thanks to ""classics"" like Mc Hammers ""U Can't Touch This"", Electric Six' ""Danger! High Voltage"" or even Bon Jovis ""Livin' On A Prayer""...but it's missing The Knacks ""My Sharona"" and The Prodigys ""Firestarter"" which were played in the trailers......The new songs espcially made for the soundtrack, which includes Pinks new video ""feel good time"", are more average.....Nevertheless it worth buying because of the ""evergreens""....."
3,songs they missed out,"they totally missed out on the beginning song they had for this movie's trailer. everywhere i saw the trailer, i got excited cause of the song by the knacks 'my sharona' and i was so excited for this cd, BUT they didn't put it in... along with prodigy's 'firestarter'... tsk tsk"
3,SOME ANSWERS,The song where Cameron Diaz is riding the bull is Wild Thing (Tone Loc) and The Prodigy's songs are Smack My Bitch Up and Firestarter (The Fat Of The Land).
3,Guitar theme,"I'd like to know the name of that guitar theme, too (the one where Drew Barrymore is walking into the Mexican bar). If anyone knows what it's called, please post!"
3,HELP ME!!!!!!,What is that song played when Dylan leaves the angels...the guitar and orchestra song...PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME! I'm going crazy...
1,WHY?,Why did they not include the songs from Motley Crue and Prodigy from the first film and again they failed to put Prodigy's Firestarter in the soundtrack. What's wrong with these people?!
4,PRETTY GOOD CD,"THAT GUITAR SONG WHEN DREW BARRYMORE IS WALKING INTO THE BAR IS CALLED:""Sleepwalk""Written by Santo Farina, John Farina and Ann FarinaPerformed by Santo and Johnny"
5,moving,"This book was very well done. There was a lot of thought put into the photographs. The main subject, Donna was going through extreme chemotherapy and the photgraph captures the pain that she was enduring. It is definitely worth your time and your money. I would definitely recommend this book to lovers of photography."
1,biff rose is a hate monger,Biff Rose is a bitter hateful lunatic. His beautiful sensitive music has been forgotten and he is ravished by madness.Just checkout his websites. Sad.
3,Biff is still one of a kind.,"I remember Biff Rose from many years ago when he had a huge hit with 'The Thorn In Mrs. Roses Side' He was on The Tonight Show many times and his songs were sweet and funny. This album is much darker. Some of the 'songs' are simply rants about things that only Biff understands. He still has a unique sound and is still fun to listen to, but I really miss the old Biff. Rose fans are a diehard lot and most will want this album like I did, but what I would like most of all is a CD of the old 'Thorn' album. Hope this happens soon, I think it would make money for whoever produces it."
2,Biff where have you been?,"I, too, am a great fan of ""A Thorn in Mrs. Rose's Side"". I especially love the song ""Molly"". I have been looking for the CD and do hope that someone will re-release it on CD for all of Biff's fans. Looking forward to the new CD, but haven't heard it yet."
5,An Incredibly Talented Artist...,"Robbie Nevil is an incredibly gifted singer/songwriter/musician. It's a real shame that he isn't as famous he deserves to be. Upon purchasing his CD's and listening to them, I came away feeling slightly saddened by the fact that tremendous talent like Mr. Nevil are almost always overlooked in favor of what's basically commercial and what sells. I do wish Mr. Nevil all the best. If you can find his recordings, please purchase them. I promise, you will not be dissapointed!!!"
2,TOO THIN!,"Perhaps these were exactly as described, but I had trouble getting them to fit our 32-gallon trash can at all. In fact, it just doesn't fit at the top. The plastic is super, super thin. I suggest using these for only light trash. We used the bags to hold packages that were waiting to be shipped -- packages that are already in a poly mailer. These ripped over and over again. We had to use several layers. They are just not worth it. We've ended up with a much higher mil and that works best for us."
5,An in depth look at the birth/delivery of an amzing airplane,"For those with an interest or background in aviation, this book details the development of the latest Boeing commercial airplane. Written by one who has hands on technical experience, it is not so technical that the average armchair enthusiast wouldn't enjoy not only the text but some fantastic photos. This book through the evolution of the 777 confirms to the flying public the extraordinary amount of testing a new airliner is put through before the public gets to enjoy the benefit of all that testing. It is well worth reading."
4,Triple 7 rates a triple 10!,"For fans of the Boeing 777 in particular, and aviation buffs in general, this book fills the bill. The graphics and photographs are excellent and help guide the reader through the process of the development of the United States'(and likely the world's) most advanced jetliner. The author does an outstanding job of detailing the concept, design, manufacturing and certification of this aircraft. At the same time, the reader does not have to be a technical wiz to understand what's involved in the start to finish of building a jetliner today. A good addition to the aviation lover's bookshelf."
3,as you'd expect a remix album,"good, but if your fond of the originals, it just doesn't have the same effect. don't get me wrong, i was neither upset or offended by any of the remixes (which is usually the case with remixes of classics), some were actuily an interesting interpretation -even enjoyable! but no phantom power!!"
3,not his greatest,I love Dean Koontz and have read all of his books. I did notthink that this was his greatest work. Usually I can't puthis stuff down either. I thought the characters were predictable.Sorry Dean.
1,Formulaic and droll...,"Overwritten and very predictable. I regret trusting the favorable reviews. Prior to purchasing this book I had just finished The Stand by King. It is painfully clear that Koontz does not possess the same prowess, though I won't assert that conclusion based on reading just one book by Dean. Perhaps he has penned some quality novels, but do not waste your time or money with this one."
4,solid read.,"I was a good story though. It really got good when the girl was driving down that dark highway and she seen the lights nearing her, and it turned out to be a cop, which turned out to be.... aww I think I will you read it for yours self, for I dont want to spoil it for you. Good story."
3,A very intersting Book,"Intensity, well that says it all. The book is high speed all the way through. The ending is also one of the better endings Dean Koontz has written. All in all this is a worthy book and well worth the read. Also the fact that it all takes place in a 24 hour period was really cool. It kept the pace really moving."
5,intensity,"This was one of the scariest books that I have ever read, because I could see it happening! Very well written."
2,Mental images that you really don't need in your brain,"This book was well written, and does keep you on the edge of your seat. However, throughout the book I was cringing at the graphic and shocking nature of the evil lived out in the ""bad guy"". I now wish that I hadn't filled my mind with all of the disgusting images that this book has to offer. I believe in the truth of the cliche ""garbage in - garbage out"" and I'm sure that I'm the worse for taking in this type of ""garbage"".For those of you who have read the all-time best-seller ""The Bible"", reading this book is in opposition to the teaching in Phil 4:8."
1,Overwhelming,"You know how somebody starts talking to you and you realize they're overwhelming you with their rhetoric. Most times, we say back, ""Please speak in English, simple terms."" Well, that's what Intensity did to me. Most Koontz books are overly heavy on detail anyway, but ""Intensity"" did me in. If an eyelash fell in this novel, he would write two or more paragraphs about it.It's one thing to be erudite, yet another to wordy enough to sink the Titanic. I know Koontz is trying to create a reaction in the reader, but this is way overdoing it. I think I'll go back to normal mystery and detective novels and leave the Koontz stuff to the rest of you who are totally enamored with the man."
2,Intensity gets Boring,"This is definitely not one of the authors best books. It take place in a twenty four hour period which is depicted in over 400 pages. Some spots are as the title states are ""intense"". Other parts are just down right dragged out such as the section where Chyna tries to get untied from the table. Would have been a great book if condensed more."
1,Not very good,"I have read several Dean Koontz novels. Some are excellent (Phantoms, The Face of Fear) and most are fairly good (Midnight, Dark Rivers of the Heart, Icebound). Unfortunately, some are just not worth finishing (Dragon Tears). This book is one I finished, but is not a good example of Koontz' work. It was billed as extremely intense and Mr. Koontz even says it was the most intense to write (end notes in 'Tick Tock'). Overwrought is a better description. The sequence of events happening in a 24 hour time span just do not generate enough copy to fill the number of pages necessary for a big novel. This tale would have been better as a short story. The interest level dropped after the first few chapters due to extreme repetitiveness. I would recommend many other Koontz books, but not this one."
1,BORING!,"I have not yet finished the book, but will, just because I bought it. I find the killer, Vess, to be highly self-indulgent, but interesting as there really are people out there like him. Chyna on the other hand is an IDIOT! And I find Koontz' writing to be dull, repetitious, over manipulated, wordy and tiresome. This is the first of his books I have read, disappointingly, and probably the last. The only reason I read as much as I have in such a short amount of time is because I found one only needs to read every other paragraph since he is so repetitive. Did I say he repeats himself? And rehashes everything ad infinitum. Go back to writing class, Dean."
3,Critics,The book was good overall. It has a very slow start then the middle of the book was the best and towards the book slows down again. Overall I will still read him again.
3,Wordy,"I did enjoy this book, but it had one unforgivable problem: 150+ pages of nothing. Much of this book is telling what Chyna could do and then what would happen if she did that, and why that wouldn't be a good idea. It does that about four times before she actually decides to do something. Another example of wordiness is Mr. Vess and what ""intriques"" him. Koontz seems to have told everything, which would probably be every noun in the dictionary. Trees intrique him, blood intriques him, etc. etc. I didn't buy Vess's character, either. There is a point where people become too wierd.However, the last hundred pages are good. If you are a Koontz fan, you should greatly enjoy this."
3,The scariest I have ever read!,"With the possible exception to Patterson's ""Kiss the Girls or Silence of the Lambs, Intensity, might be the scariest thriller I have read. I stayed up all night reading, could not put it down. It starts on page one with fast moving cars, and the whole scene hiding under the bed, probably his best ever!"
5,Chillingly good - and possibly real,"It's been shown by criminologists that most serial killers are friendly, intelligent people in everyday life. Dean Koontz has produced a worthy companion to the likes of Dragon Tears with this stunning chiller / thriller which not only tackles this issue head on with a smart, likeable killer named Edgler Vess, but brings in the sub plot of a tortured young woman, Chyna Shepherd, who has to fly in the face of everything life has taught her to save herself as well as Vess's next victim, an innocent girl. A true psychological tale, full of suspense and intrigue, and a stunning revelation about Vess at the end. A magnificent piece of work with brilliant prose and a hard-hitting plot."
3,Have read better by Koontz.,"Have read many books by Koontz. The ending of this one was very disapponting. But, since I love most of his books, I will keep on reading him."
5,Must read!!!!,"I read this book a few years ago and decided to read it again. I'm glad I did, I had forgotten how intense this book is, can't put it down!!!!"
1,intensity so intense it becomes unbelievable.,"I purchased this book after finishing the Harry Bosch series and the Reacher series. I was looking for another series of books by a good author. The start of the book held hope of a good read but as the story proceeds it fills more and more with unfortunate occurrences for the characters and rambling thoughts of the characters that I found myself skipping forward trying to get to some meat. I finally gave up and deleted the book from my e-reader. Not my ""cup of tea"".Intensity"
3,This Could be a Good Movie,"This is the 3rd Koontz book I read, and it was pretty good. The heroine of the story was excellent and compelling. I despised the villain, which is the goal of the author, so he succeeded. This book could easily be a movie (if it isn't yet)."
3,not as good as people say,"this book was awesom at first, but then i thought it got kinda' slow. It just didn't blow me away and seem as intense as people said it would be. I sometimes thought to myself, ""That blew you away?"" it wasn't THAT intense. It's a dean koontz book so it's a good book, but just not a nail biting edge of your seat thriller. I also thought it was annoying sometimes, the 2nd person narration with the sociopath, edgler vess. If you want a book as terrifying as pople say, read the taking, or winter moon, if you like intensity, i think you'll like velocity even more."
5,outstanding,"This book is a major page turner. I enjoyed it immensely and believe that this is one of Koontz's best. Although somewhat predictable, you couldn't help but turn the page to see what happened next"
4,Pure caffeine!,"Full of McGyver-isms, this book leaves no time to sleepuntil you reach its predictable end.The psi-profile of the characters looks like done by theMarquis of Sade: the good-beaten-tormented-and-virtuousvictim confronts the powers of the ultimate, most pervertedcriminal. Don't sweat it, she wins.If you like Koontz, you'll enjoy it."
2,Not impressed.,"For the record, this is the first Dean Koontz book I hadread and I read it because my girlfriend loves this author.I found the book to be fairly predictable and was annoyedwith the stupidity of the main character. I really did notenjoy the author's style and found the book to beoverflowing with flowery descriptions and irrelevantinformation. After hearing praises about the work of thisauthor, I must admit that I am very disappointed. I guesshis style is something you either love or hate...I hate it.-BG"
5,Definitely lives up to it's title!!,"Dean Koontz is the master of suspense, and Intensity is no exception! I couldn't wait to see what that psycho would do next. Definitely one that you stay up until the wee hours of the morning to finish!!"
3,ANOTHER Happy Ending???,"I admit, the story was intense and disturbing. But to be frank, I have read one too many Dean Koontz books with happy endings. I mean, every once in a while, you have to kill the MAIN character just to keep people in suspense. I just don't buy it any more and I'm not going to be reading much Koontz for a while."
5,Scary Stuff,"I'm glad I'm not the only person that was kept awake till all hours of the early morning, and had to work the day next day may I add, to read this book. Some advice, don't read this book if you are alone!!!! May csuse serious insomnia. The heroine is bold, but obviously a little wacked, the villian is surreal, extremely sadistic, the story line was well written but a little predictable towards the end. It is a definate must read if thrillers are at the top of your list. The scariest part if this book is knowing that people like that really exist, except the reality of any situation like this would surely end in a less than predictable way. Reminds me of the infamous Paul Bernardo school girl kidnappings and tortures. Very disgusting. Hope you have a good stomach for these things. Enjoy!!!"
3,A good read for a quiet weekend.,"I had given up on DK more than a few books ago and was encouraged by a friend to read this one. I thought it was very average, entertaining yet easily forgotten. The best thing about reading it is I may not be so quick to dismiss his stories in the future."
5,"BRILLIANT, WRENCHING, POETIC, DISTURBING...","...ARE THE WORDS THAT ONLY BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THIS SOLID THRILLER FROM THE BIG K, WHO I'D NEVER READ BEFORE. LIKE MISERY BY THE OTHER BIG K, LIKE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (CHYNNA SHEPHARD--C.S.--CLARICE STARLING--GET IT?) SOMEONE FORGOT TO TELL KOONTZ HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HACK. THIS BOOK IS BRILLIANT IN THE WAY IT DEPOSITS YOU WITH NO BREATHER INTO THE WORLD OF THE PSYCHO, ARMED WITH ONLY AS MUCH INFO AS POOR CHYNNA HAS. I WORK ON A PSYCH UNIT AND CAN ASSURE YOU VESS'S WALK THE EARTH, DRIVE CARS, AND LIVE DOWN THE STREET FROM SOME OF US...AND JUST AS SURELY, THE ONLY VICTIMS WHO EVER TRULY RECOVER ARE THE CHYNNAS, WHO, TO BORROW A SINGER'S PHRASE, KICK AT THE DARKNESS TIL IT BLEEDS DAYLIGHT. DON'T DISMISS THIS AS A PULP FICTION, ITS CORE IS SOMETHING CLOSER TO POST-MODERN LITERATURE."
5,The Title says it ALL,"Never have I had to stop reading a book before in my life until I read ""Intensity""... 4 times I had to put the book down because I was so terrified! A VERY intense story. This one will definitely keep you interested!Great Job Mr. Koontz!"
3,"Interesting, but not really THAT Intense.","The early part of the book is written poorly. We get to learn about Chyna Sheppard and the way Koontz writes it makes her appear flat, especially for someone who went through such a traumatic childhood.However, the book takes off as the family she is staying with is visited by a mysterious killer. Koontz puts an interesting spin on him, but the killer is never really fleshed out and I was in disbelief at the killer's views on how he finds sensory experiences as Intense moments.The plotline, however is good and deserves kudos. Especially the escape and how Koontz played Sheppard against time to free herself and other captor.If only his writing would have been better...Rating: C+"
3,Typical Koonz average crime novel,"A stream of crime and horror events lingering on the edge of surrealism. A clash between two well develop intense characters following for some moments the cat and mouse and for other times the David vs Goliath scheme. The author accomplishes the goal to create action packed suspense, with panic heartbeat pounding and the inability for the reader to anticipate what is in the offing and what he has got under the sleeve, using a crisp, specific and detailed writing style. But, too long for the purpose"
5,hands down the best book ever written,"i have most of dean koontz's novels and i LOVE THEM ALL but i especially love INTENSITY. this novel is one of the most flawlessly written novels in recent years, even better than some overly praised dead authors. INTENSITY is scary and relentless. this is the only novel that has made my heart pound in my chest. i highly recommend this novel. Simply the best, and i can honestly say that he writes even better than Stephen King, Peter Straub and all the other authors. Dean Koontz never lets up. this man can write and INTENSITY proves his power. unrelentingly suspenseful!!"
1,yawn,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. THIS BOOK GAVE ME A HEADACHE. I USED TO BE SUCH A FAN.I COULDNT EVEN FINISH THIS BOOK. IT WAS REPETITIVE AND BORING.
1,Not Intense Enough,"This book was HORRIBLE! I can't even believe it was a bestseller! What is even more hard to believe is that in almost all the customer reviews it got five stars! Um what is going on here? Did someone come along and snath all of your brains because i honestly can not comprehend that someone with and intelligence would give this book a FIVE! Incase anyone is reading this and saying whatever she doesn't even have any evidence to support her opinion well here is why: 1. How exactly did chyna get out of being chained to the chair? Oh wait there was two chapters on it. in case you didn't catch what i was hinting at TOO MUCH DETAIL! Detail is good but not in overload. 2. The pace, wait or should i say the lack of one. I was so confused right when i thought i understood. these are just few things.. if you have problem with this i can be reached at aurora5_99@yahoo.com"
2,My first Koontz book and my last,"Chyna (the heroine of the book) is the most stupid girl I have ever read about. The book is long, redundant in details and the plot is far fetched."
3,Koontz has become pretty predictable,"I used to love Koontz. But the books have become very predictable as to formula and method. Often magic dogs or animals. Often strong woman gets even. It's like someone writes an outline with favorite cliches, and then fills in the blanks with variations on characters.This one lives up to its name. It is INTENSE. If you can get through the first half, continue. The second half is much better."
5,Koontz is my new favorite author.,"His characters become your friends. This book is a superb example of his masterful characterization, surpassed (in my mind) only by Chris Snow and friends in Fear Nothing/Seize the Night. I have long had a habit of ""casting"" fiction works; that is, assigning well known actors and actresses to the roles of the major characters. If you've read this book, or intend to, try casting Winona Ryder as Chyna and George Clooney as the smugly insane Vess. (Yeah, yeah, Clooney is a ""good guy"" actor - but he would be brilliant here!) There are few Koontz books that I would not give 5 stars to - he's that good. Not quite the command of the language that Stephen King has, not quite the literary voice of King, but vastly more entertaining, tasteful and relateable. After discovering Koontz, I may never read King again!"
3,where is the motive?,"Although Dean Koontz is my favorite author and I do feel bad giving a review of less than four stars, this book was lacking an important quality - a compelling storyline. It was just some sicko dude committing all sorts of atrocities just for the sake of it. The twist at the end was surprising, but not anything fascinating. The characters had no connection to one another, there were no hidden motives... it was just gore.However, it wasn't a total loss. The book was full of suspense and difficult to put down. So, strange as this may sound, I did enjoy it even though it lacked certain qualities that make a book exceptional."
3,Couldn't Stand This Book,"Alright, I tolerated it but I certainly couldn't stand it. Chyna Shepard got on my nerves, why not just call the police when she had several opportunities to? Hey you can spell ""BORED"" out of the letters in my name which is what this book caused me...lots of boredome."
4,Too Little for the Title,"This is a truly good book, BUT...the rhythm of the story could well have been improved upon had Mr. Koontz embellished upon the nature of the madness not only with the character, but the madness involved with the dog attack. There is a lack of descriptive detail involving the person under attack, or the abductees thoughts as she sat captive. This is good suspense, but it lacks true horror quality in leaving out the darkest sides of the characters for the imagination. I find the book to be a four star read because of this. If it had delved into the extremely dark and twisted side of human reality on a deeper level, then it would have gotten the extra star to make it a smash hit novel."
3,Unabashadly Predictable,"I've read several of Koontz's books and never have I felt that one of the movies based on his books actually lived up to the text. However, after reading Intensity, I can only think that it would better as a MOVIE than a book. The premise is provocative, if not entirely original, and the action scenes are written well. Several times throughout the book the plot lagged and was redundant. It seemed more as filler between action sequences; the parts where the reader gets a glimpse into Chyna's psyche are excellent, but they too become repetitive. Too many descriptions of dobermans, gleaming knives and cellophane wrappers overwhelm a plot that could have been resolved quicker and more satisfying."
2,"A quick, exciting read, but flawed.","At a certain point I really thought the female protagonist ought to go to the police...this is one of those stories where the central character becomes so focussed on catching the killer herself that she acts foolishly. I also found her memory of her mother and her mother's boyfriend to be beyond belief in terms of their bloodlust and their rather vague political ""causes""."
2,Too much monotony,It was alright I guess. The only problem is that Dean Koontz spent too much time speaking of the same thing. It gets a bit boring. But it is not too bad.
2,I wasn't that impressed with this book.,This was the first Dean Koontz book that I read and I didn't think it was that good. Thank goodness that I read Dragon Tears immediately afterward because that got me hooked on Dean Koontz. My other favorites are Lightning and Tick Tock.
5,I Couldn't Stop Listening!,"There couldn't be a better title for this book. It's definitely intense! I listened to the unabridged audio version, and I couldn't listen fast enough. I had to take my Walkman to work to finish it!"
5,One of Koontz's best yet,"This book is fantastic, I would put it right after Strange Highways which is my favorite. The story line was excellent. If you are an X-Files fan, you'll love this book"
5,The best book I have ever read.,"Brillently woven story of suspense and integration of real feelings make this a book I couldn't put down. Very talented writter, I wish i would have discovered him long before last years vacation when I found this incredible paperback."
4,Gave it away...,"A great read. Fast moving and intense, but that's the title. I could have given it a five except for a major gaffe. Koontz ruins the ending by ""telegraphing"" an important fact about the purp that anybody could have seen ""coming down Broadway."" I read about 100+ of the other reviewers here and nobody else complained, maybe it's just me, but it cushioned the shock of an otherwise great ending because I knew it was coming. This is a great book if you don't mind the cruelty involved but at least the killings in the present tense are quick with no torture involved."
5,thrilled in dallas,"I'll keep it short and sweet. I couldn't put it down! Loved it! I guess it's my favorite because it could really happen. I wouldn't go chasing after him, but then again, If he had someone I loved...think about it. My mother has worked in hospitals and state-hospitals all my life. The stories that I have been told and the story line of Intensity hit home. When I drive down the road and pass a motor home I look, I wonder, I get the hell away from them. After you read this one you will be looking over your shoulder, looking to see who is walking in the store as you are shopping. You will always wonder who you can trust!You have to read this one. You won't be able to put it down. To those who think that this isn't that good, just name one that is better and we will read the review on it."
5,This book still haunts me,"I listened to this audio a few months ago, and it made such an impression I think I can recite parts of it verbatim, although I heard it only once. Ironically, I put off listening to it at first because the story outline as described (accurately) on the box didn't sound particularly interesting, and it wouldn't sound any more intriguing if I tried to go over it here. But that's the enigma of this book. The two lead characters have no overt supernatural powers; they have no horns or tails or claws; they have no connection to another planet, another century, another species (you'd be proud to bring that homicidal maniac home to mama), but I was so totally spooked I loved it. Kate Burton's performance had a lot to do with my enjoyment of this classic. Her quiet, almost monotone delivery is the perfect way to sustain the degree of tension in which one can't help being enmeshed. This is a keeper."
4,This is a fast-paced novel!,"Although I am a Dean Koontz fan, I left this book sitting on my bookshelf for two years before I decided to read it. I should have read it the day I got it. Its a wonderful, heart stopping story that takes place in the span of only 24 hours. Chyna Shepard is the kind of heroine we like to see. She is smart, vivacious and not afraid to take risks. I found myself actually talking out loud to her, warning her of what was coming. The end was good, albeit predictable. Worthy of reading, for sure."
3,A bit too wordy,"The book was 'good', but for some reason I just couldn't wait for it to end - I even skimmed a few pages (which I never do in a book).Perhaps after reading Watchers, I was expecting a better book, (as Watchers was is easily among my top 5 books). I'm still going to try Koontz again though..."
5,A must read,Even non-readers will find it hard to put this book down. A true rollercoaster of a story. If you're a fan of suspense or thrillers don't hestitate to give this a shot
4,Definitely Intense!!!!!!,"Other than the dragging middle, this novel was difficult to put down. Koontz knows how to write 'em. I would recommend this to anyone who loves suspense. He knows exactly how to scare the daylights out of you.If you think you know what is going to happen next, Koontz makes it even more frightful than you'd imagine. He knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat. He is right up there with Steven King. This book definitely lives up to it's name.This was my first Koontz book, but it is certainly not the last. It was horrifying and shocking. Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read."
5,Intensity is GRIPPINGLY intense,"I have always been a fan of Koontz' novels. Each book he writes has a very different feel to it, ranging from the believable to the impossible. With Intensity, I was expecting to find at least one impossible moment, but to my surprise, and HORROR, I found none. The way Koontz has brought Edgler Vess to life, while creating in his words an ""intense"" character, did not make him supernatural in any way. Just twisted and sick. By the time I finished the book (which took two days, btw), my heart was racing and my blood pounding, as I could only imagine what it would be like to have an Edgler living in my own neighborhood. All in all, I give the book a very solid 9."
5,Read it in one night!!!!!!,"I love Dean Koontz for the fact that most of his books were somewhat ""ghost stories"" or ""out of this world"". But this one was set in the present in a normal place and the fact that this could happen anytime and anyplace grabbed me. I read the book in a matter of hours than I went back and read it again. My heart would not stop pounding. I thought while I was reading this that it would make a great movie! (to bad I missed it on TV)I lent out my copy so much that I have had to replace it twice!!!"
5,"""INTENSE""","Not being a regular reader of fiction, I put off reading this book. My son urged me to read it, stating, ""if you don't read it, I'll tell you how it ends."" I stayed up till the wee hours of the morning finishing this book. Once I finished reading, I had trouble sleeping. This book definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. At times I felt as though I was in Chynas place. My hatred for the serial killer, Edgler Vess, compounded with each page. I do not intend to switch my reading material from non-fiction to fiction, but occasionally a good novel adds new perspective to life. Read this book!"
1,What a disappointment,"Hoping for a typical Koontz thriller, I dove into this book one night. I wish I hadn't because this book seemed like it was anything but a Koontz book. I found myself skimming over pages in the last half because the descriptions were lengthy and served no purpose. He goes on for 3 pages to describe how the main character is trying to get out of her shackles. This really disrupts the whole ""thriller"" part of the action when you're forced to take a break for 3 pages. It really was one of the worst books I've read in a really long time."
5,Best Koontz Novel I've Read!,"This was truly a well done piece. From the very beginning it sucked me in, and did not let me go. It was particularly well written for a Koontz novel--though still quite comercialized. The novel was very suspensful, and definately has some great twists (particularly one involving the killer's occupation.) It also contains some very exciting moments (being hidden in a killer's trailer as he's driving across the state, and trying to keep your presence unknown, etc.) THe novel was very fast paced and absorbing, with some very powerful images. The only things that were kind of tacky were a couple of metaphors involving an elk or moose (forget what.. been a while since I've read it), and a tacky ""human interest"" angle he tried to achieve with the adopting of a young female victim."
1,Intensely dull and un-origional.,This book had nothing new to offer. I felt like skimming but forced my way through. Our Heroine escapes again and again from impossible situations without any real guile. And if you cannot predict the 'twist' I imagine you have never read a book or watched a movie before.A poor man's 'Misery'.
1,Intense Junk,"For anyone who loves great literature, this is definately a book you will want to miss. I can think of no redeeming factors which excuse the low quality of craftsmanship or the stupidity of the story."
2,BORING,The Intensity doesn't deserve to be a NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. The plot is NOT intense at all though it has a surprising ending.
3,"Good, but he's done better","This one's somewhat unique in Koontz' catalogue: very compressed in time and space (only about 24 hours), which does give it a certain ""intensity"" of pacing. However, at the same time it's too limited in scope to be counted one of his better efforts."
5,Intense as Intensity can get,"Dean Koontz ""Intensity"" lives up to it's name. By the name you can tell what the book is about-INTENSITY. And intensity is what you feel by reading this book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you reading. I couldn't believe how much psychological, emotional, and physical realism King could put into the book. It's an excellent thrilling/horror book and I recomend it to any mature reader because of violent content."
1,Love Koontz - Terrible Narrator,I have always been a Koontz fan. I read the book several years ago and thought I would enjoy being able to listen to it on the road. Trying to suffer through this narrator's voice was TERRIBLE! Kate Burton was not capable of pulling off a guy's voice and ended up being down-right annoying. I've listened to several other of his books with male narrators and they all did a MUCH better job! I would not suggest this narrator to anyone.
2,Had lots of potential,"I will join the very few who did not particularly care for this novel. I've read worse, but I've also read better. Chyna goes to spend a lovely weekend with her slightly spoiled, overly wealthy friend at the beautiful family home. She winds up first fleeing and then chasing a serial killer who fancies himself indestructible. There are some worthwhile scenes: Chyna trying to creep through the house to avoid the killer preying on her friend's family. However, Koontz's dialogue and character development fell flat for me. I never really cared what happened to any of the characters, and the plot dissolved before it was truly built. I didn't feel that Vess, the killer, was really that frightening, and all the characters talked as if they were reciting lines for a school play....very stiff. Obviously, more people feel differently than I about this novel. For me, it never lives up to its name. Koontz tends to have great ideas but often fails to reach their potential."
3,A fast and furious ride to nowhere,"Definitely a hang-onto-your-seat page-turner, but in the end, Intensity left me unsatisfied. The plot is a rambling roller coaster of action and suspense with hollow characters and no point."
1,Boring as I've never seen before,"This is the worst book I've ever read in my life. The author describes everything with all detais, what makes everybody sick of reading. Elks, chairs, tables, everything deserves at least one page to describe. It seems that, if you squeeze the book, making all the useless comments flows out, you would be able to read the same history in 10 pages. The only good thing is the vocabulary. Very rich."
2,Koontz does it again...and again...and again...yawwwwn,"Sorry to be so negative. Mr. Koontz can be a talented writer at times, but, apart from the central theme of the plot, this is another ""Koontz Book"" in the same mould as most of the others. His leading characters, especially women, are always the same, attractive, a little too sensible, mostly single or have been hurt in a relationship...etc etc.This book starts out well enough (except the almost ""cut and paste"" character descriptions), but I found myself losing interest after the first fifty pages or so."
2,Another serial killer...it's enough now!,"As everybody on this page reviews the book favourably, am I the only one who can't stand serial killer anymore? We've had enough of them, I think!But the biggest problem of the book for me was: Chyna wasn't characterized well enough so that I could feel for her. Normally, Dean Koontz creates wonderful characters where the reader DEFENITELY has to know what happens to them (check out WATCHERS or Mr. MURDER), but I didn't care for Chyna very much. The book kicks into gear to fast, I don't know her well enough.And Edglar Vess, although a scary villain, stands in a long row of serial killers who haunted books and films for the last fifteen years so that he doesn't stand out.Technically, the book is ok, the style is efficient as always in the books of Dean Koontz, but, well I didn't find this book INTENSE and so I can't recommend it, although it's from one of my favourite authors.."
2,Not Koontz's Best . . .,"This is not one of Koontz's best books. It is a pretty basic thriller, and it just didn't really go anywhere. It was full of overblown descriptions, the characters were bland, and it was about as far from ""intense"" as you can get. I was very disappointed.Try the Watchers instead."
1,"Extremely Weak, Stupid Heroine","In an on-line chat session Koontz mentions that this is his favorite book. He needs to go back and read some of his GOOD novels. Every other page all I could think was, HOW STUPID CAN SHE GET? Chyna was not only stupid but weak. She manages to empathize with some girl she does not even know, and keeps company with the murderer, just in case she can save her. Save yourself - skip this book"
1,Disappointing,"I've said before that koontz doesn't write to impress any literary guilds; he writes to sell novels.Usually, they are worth the price, but 'Intensity' was so dragged-out and unbelievable, and so slow-moving that I never really finished it. I got close, but I could see where it was going and so I finally just stuck it in a drawer.If you want Koontz, there are many better ones to choose from. Don't bother with this one."
5,GREAT!!! EXCELLENT!!!,"This is one of the greatest boks I have ever read!!! It has all the components of a great book: A heroine, Suspense!, drama, and a hint of mystery. It was very enjoyable!"
3,Not Koontz Best,"I ready this several years ago, but being a Koontz fan, I read it again. Not one of his best. Tends to drone on in areas."
3,Good but I Didnt Finish,I made it through 60 pages before giving up and wiki-ing the rest. The character backstories were unnecessary and the suspense devices became repetitive and then unbelievable. Some nice poetry here and there but I found myself thinking if I'm gonna read this stuff it may as well be true crime.Intensity could have made a great short story.
5,Koontz at his Very Best - Outstanding!,"Intensity Had me hooked, with an incredible twist, right from the beginning. It's like I was sitting there just minding my own business and then BANG we're off like a shot, running at breathless speeds. Panic, fear, pitfalls and suspense!Koontz tells the story of a girl who is thrown into a nightmare within the first few pages of the book. We follow her, and beg for her safety, as she fights and hides from a cunning, and sadistic assailant. You won't believe the clever twists and turns Koontz has created in this masterpiece.Again, if you are a Dean Koontz fan and have not read Intensity you are missing perhaps one of the best novels he has ever written. If you like action, and non-stop, edge-of-your-seat suspense and excitement, this is the story. Make no mistake, Dean Koontz went over the top with this one."
4,classic Koontz,"While I generally prefer Koontz's more supernatural tales, this is one white-knuckle thrill ride with a villain you'll love to hate. Koontz seems to enjoy his psychopaths a little too much but he remains seemingly sane despite it all. Highly polished like all his work."
4,Fast but full of action,"This book went pretty fast, there isn't any thime wasted on details. The story starts out a bit weird, but I gets good in the middle.This is one of those books that even made my shiver while reading it ... I usually don't get that feeling quickly while watching horror movies, and certainly not while reading books, but this one was an exception I guess. The last part of the book was just so intense, it was like a was running away from the psychotic guy.Not just an entertaining story, but an intense one"
5,Just one point I need to state.,"All of the high ratings on this book are all true, but one thing none of them said that I found was much of the book is stating what could of happened (If she grabbed the knife he would have seen her and killed her. If she would have run away he would have heard her etc.). That was my only complaint."
3,Another good Wilcox mystery,"Carl Wilcox helps host a 10-year reunion in this installment of the series, but it isn't long into the reunion of Corden's undefeated football team that the popular quarterback Harmon ""Heart"" Turner is found dead in a shower, killed by what turns out to be a slingshot. The mayor asks Carl to look into it, because of his reputation for solving murders. Carl digs into the past, and finds out that somebody is carrying a long grudge about the actions of four of the players and the coach's daughter. Good mystery, with a few surprises."
5,Barbaro!!!,"It is a pleasure to listen to so-called ""salsa"" (it had been called afro-Cuban music in its various forms since the beginning of times) with lyrics that make sense, and more than that, are poetry. The musicians and arrangements are superb. Just at the end, a very pleasant surprise - a ""cameo appearance"" by Silvio Rodriguez with Issac in ""Vamos a andar"": their two-part harmony is unbelievable. For connoisseurs, this track and ""Identidad"", feature some heavy-duty afro-Cuban percussion, the real thing. A must-have album."
3,"good, but not wonderful","Good: Excellent writing, great pictures, and would recommend it for anyone who wants to know a little bit more about German culture and history. Alo liked the fact that it was in color.Not Wonderful: A bit on the snobish side, not very user friendly, no immediate translations of german terms into english, the hotels are not broken up into categories, and one must do a lot of going back and forth between sections to find out particular german words and other codes. Moreover, it is geared for travelers from english speaking countries (Australia, NZ, Canada, US, UK and Ireland). Actually ommited some sights in Berlin like the new holocaust victims memorial.Recommendations: if you want to learn more, buy this book. If you want to travel, buy Lonely planet, since it is much easier to use, has more information on sights, facilities, embassies and consulates from other non english speaking countries plus emergency medical services. Both books are good, though.AW"
1,If you are new to scrapbooking pass this one up,Sure it has beautiful layouts and if you are not a newbie you might enjoy it. It is way to advanced to start out with.
5,Just what I wanted,"Great fit, good quality and they arrived in time. I've ordered a second batch of them. The length of the briefs are perfect, as shown in the photos. They're comfortable and seem to be of high quality. I recommend!"
2,Already falling apart,Both pairs are already falling apart on me... boxers I've had for years are in better shape than this.
3,"Product is good, but after 6 months need a new pair","I would give 3.5 stars, but would go for Calvin Klein next time.This produs stratches after 6 months of use...."
3,Nice fit but not well made,My Husband liked the way they fit and said they are comfortable but there was a hole in the seam that I had to repair before he could even wear them.
2,Thin material and odd sizing.,"No where near the thickness of store bought products of the same brand/type. The sizing ran small, so if you are a 36 better jump up to the next size range. Men do not buy under garments often so I guess that is why we get robbed when it comes time to buy new pairs."
2,Not that practical,Nice clean Braun design but the hands are not at all luminous as advertised. Not so useful in a dark room.
2,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"If you are a true fan of 70's Soul music, I would recommend avoiding this DVD. I had just watched a wonderful 70's Soul show on Maryland Public Television, and was hoping that this would be somewhat similar to that. I was really disappointed, to say the least! The sound quality is horrible, and the performances were pretty sub-standard, with the possible exception of the Stylistics. The Chi-lites totally destroy ""Oh Girl."" It was painful to watch this video! I would not recommend it to anyone!"
4,the Show is nice but there could have been,more added to balance out all the songs&Acts that Performed. the Music was on Point&it was Great seeing&Hearing from Peeps that have Been Missed by myself&others for a Good Minute.I wish for a full overview&History section.Hopefully in the future it will come to pass.but this is a Good Setting for starters.
4,Keepsake Box,"Very very cute keepsake box. I bought this as a gift for a friend, and I know she will love it!"
5,Great gift for a friend,This is a very nice box for a friend. Delicate looking but sturdy. I know my friend will love it.
1,disappointaned,i was very up-set it's called a keepsake box it's not that's a lie it's a plake a little tiny one it's nothing like i wanted and all they could say was i'm sorry but it is what it is crazy
4,Excellent Handbook,"This book is an excellent resource for researching the life and works of Beethoven. The sections regarding compositions are broken down by ensemble and type, and provide important information such as performance dates, key signatures, time signatures, and movement headings. Almost all topics, including such things as Beethoven's handwriting, favorite literature, philosophies, thoughts on other composers, are covered. Very handy for reference, as well as a guide to starting Beethoven research. Well worth it at twice the price!"
1,Locks too small,I was really disappointed in just how small these three locks were. I don 't know what they are designed to secure because they are so small. Threw in a drawer and hopefully one day I will find an application. Photos are misleading as to size.
3,Research is Key.,"Short story. I needed a computer as I was working in SE Asia all of last year. I bought this laptop (which I'm still using) due to a crunch-time situation and needed computer/internet access. I bought this in January 2007 for MSRP of $1100 USD. Within the last year, and you can read several other reviews, the CD player has 'a mind of it's own'... If this is a software or OS issue, HP needs to GET WITH THE PROGRAM and NOTIFY IT'S CUSTOMERS. I have never bought a brand new laptop before (mind you) but I WILL DEFINITELY TEST OUT OTHER NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS before purchasing another HP laptop."
3,Mayday,"My husband is a ""Clive Cussler"" fan, so I do my best to acquire as many of Clive's books for him, as possible.I was very disappointed to learn that MAYDAY was the original title published in England and was the same story as Mediterranean Caper.It's sad when two different titles of the same book, leaves the shopper to believe that they are two different stories.We still love Clive, but don't care for the practice of publishing under a second title."
1,The Book Clive Cussler Mayday,This Book Is The Older Version Of The Mediterranean Caper . How Come It's Not Mentioned That This Is A An Updated Version of The Story Any Place In In The Mediterranean Caper Book ?
1,wrong language,thought i was getting book in english .instead they sent it in french.sent it back for recredit to my account. some companeys should state what language a person wants.instead of presuming.
4,Excellent retrospective,"Unlike many Best of CD's this one crosses her entire recording career and labels. It includes scratchy tracks from 1935 up to pristine recording in 1958. This is about as good primer of her career as you can expect. Furthermore, it isn't marred by an overly bright or compressed sound that you often find in some modern remasters. My only complaint and the main reason I'm writing this review is that the jewel case is essentially useless. The discs no matter how I try, do not stay within the spindle. It's beyond me how any record company can use such a defective case design. It's really annoying."
5,Great Strings,"John Pearse makes awesome strings. I was traveling and made a stop in an Idaho guitar shop to get some new strings for my guitar. At the time I was using other acoustic guitar strings made by a well known company. The guy in the guitar shop recommended John Pearse strings. Even though they were a bit more expensive than the other strings I was using, I bought them and I've been using them ever since. String type and string gauge is all a matter of personal opinion so I can't say what is best. I usually buy these because they're the cheapest and sound good to my ears. But with all the John Pearse strings I have tried, they all last a long time and sound better than any other strings made by some different company."
4,Even if you don't believe it...,"...this book works. You don't have to believe Florinda Donner experienced or witnessed everything in this book to find something useful about her portrayal of the life of a Venezuelan healer and spiritualist (our modern, American terms). Read it like a novel that certainly feels like it was thoroughly researched. You'll find it an excellent journey to a place you've never been before."
2,Florinda donner- grau,"I did not find the book all that appealing. I purchased it, in hopes it would be simualar to Carlos Castaneda's work. It wasn't. It was very different from the work of Castaneda. It takes you to a whole different world and way of viewing the world. I did enjoy the book but thought it was very unspecified in making the points clear. It left me with a feeling of going nowhere. That's just my personal opinion though."
4,Wow,"One of the best, written by one of Carlos Castaneda's cadre. Was very good to get the feminine view of the Toltec path taught by don Juan Matus and his companions."
1,If you are looking for another American Pie forget it,"This is far worse than the American Pie movies. It's not funny, has very poor acting (which I expected). Don't waste you money. I'm not sure why this is unrated, as there is almost no nudity in the film. Where did the makers of H.O.T.S. and Bikini Carwash go?"
5,"Amazing, But I think you have to be an artist to enjoy this","I realy dont like metal all to much, i dont like your dream theatres cheasy vocals and I only like certain prog metal and this is it."
2,If only the guy would stop screaming this would be cool,"So...I bought this cd not knowing anything whatsoever about the band. I listened to a couple of bits, and it sounded like some good musicianship. The couple of bits I listened to didn't have the screaming.I'm a huge fan of 80's metal. I still think the early Iron Maiden is brilliant. I also like flashy instrumentals--and there is that here. In fact...I'd probably love this if it weren't for the nails-on-the-chalkboard screaming that intrudes on the melodies.I don't get it. What's the appeal of the screamed lyrics that you can't understand without reading the insert? A good scream now and again is fine, but screamed lyrics? It sure ain't singing.And it fatally mars what could have been a very fine bit of music."
5,Progressive Hradcore Jazz all rolled into one...,"When first hearing the song ""The Passage"" I was stunned on how...different they sounded. Their sound is Unique, you wont find another band like them! (similar bands do include Dysrhtyhmia and Cynic, well, those are the ones that come to mind anyways. Although there is no Best Song on the album, each song does sound different, having its own color of the painters pallette if you will. To describe this album is beyond words. If youve heard their old stuff your in for a surprise because now they have a new lineup, including a fantastic jazz drummer, who infact makes the transitions in the music styles effortlessly in this album. To compare the this album to any of their previous work would be unfair because the turn of direction, but in my oppinion the best material of theirs so far. Now go and buy buy their CD!"
3,Hard to Find,"Difficult to find in my area. A product that exfoliates and softens your skin, not a miracle find but decent at what it delivers. Jury still out on how it handles brown spots and hormonally induced splotchiness."
3,Blu-Ray Technical Specs,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines [Blu-ray]Feature film Blu-Ray technical specifications:Video: 1080p, 2.40:1Audio:* English Dolby Digital 5.1* French Dolby Digital 5.1* Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1I'm hopeful that Amazon's technical specifications listings will become more useful."
5,"Awesome DVD, awesome movie","You wonder, why did they make a T3? Did Arnold really need the money?Things could have been awful. You have a 58-year old man playing the exact same character he played nearly 20 years ago. The absence of James Cameron could have really destroyed this movie.However, the cast is excellent. Arnold was in excellent shape for this movie, and he definitely was born to play the T-101. Nick Stahl does a fantastic job as the new John Connor, and Claire Danes is solid as usual. The T-X is perfect as well, played by Kristanna Lokken. The movie ends the only way it really could end, yet it is somewhat surprising. The special effects are spectacular, the sound mix is incredible, and the transfer is perfect. This is one of those DVD's you should use to show off your system.I highly recommend T3."
5,I'LL BE BACK!,I saw this in the movie theatres only five months ago and now I will add this to my collection! I own Everything on the TERMINATOR series.
4,Great addition to the series !,"This movie was very entertaining. Being an avid fan of the first two in the series I really didn't know what to expect. The previews really didn't look that good. However, I was presently surprised. The chase scene through the streets of LA was unbelievable. Arnold was actually hilarious. Was it the best in the series? Better then the 1st, almost as good as the 2nd. Overall a really enjoyable movie that keeps you entertained throughout."
2,Planet of the Arnolds...,"There is a noted similarity between this movie and the second Planet of the Apes movie (Return to the POTA). Each movie is a rehash of the previous, but no longer fresh or as smart. The characters run out of room to escape fate, and the world ends. Been there..."
1,missed out obviusly,this film movie series jumped the dolphin a long time ago and then just threw in a woman terminator to make it all better again. ha? for a start the woman terminator could just have pretended to Arnold that she loved him. they could then have gone back in time together to caveman times or at least the middle ages and had a robot family which would then have ruled the world easy by the time john connor was supossed to be born. yet we're supossed not to even notice that. pathetic.
2,This series should be terminated.,"I just finished watching ""Terminator 3"" and I think they should have just ended the series with ""Terminator 2.""As I see it, there were two main things wrong with the movie. The first was the fact that most of it seemed like one continuous car chase. Not that the first two movies didn't have their share of them, but in this case it didn't add anything to the story (or lack thereof). The second problem had to do with ending. I won't give it away, but it was thoroughly depressing and I suspect was most of what kept people away in droves when this movie was in the theater.There were a few funny parts here and there, mostly spoofing scenes from the other two movies. Unfortunately, they weren't enough to save this film.I recall hearing that the producers of the movie had to fork over around $10 million for Arnold Schwarzenegger. They definitely got ripped off."
4,Kristanna Loken is the HOTTEST female in the universe!!!,"Yea, I only liked this movie because Kristanna Loken was in it... she's so f@#king HOT!!! Actually, it was an ok movie, but it doesnt hold a flame to T2. But hey... it's got Kristanna Loken... YEEEAAAHHH!!!"
1,Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"We were sent a replacement DVD for the original one was returned as ""unplayable"" in all of our DVD players including our Playstation 3. It was shocking to find out that the NEW one sent to us is also non-playable. We will be returning it too."
2,Are You Kidding?!,"I am not sure which is worse - the idea that they are bringing back the Terminator movies or that Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for office in California. This movie had a bad plot and equally bad acting. The only character that I enjoyed was the TX girl (the ""bad"" robot) and she only had about 3 speaking lines in the entire movie! Save your money or go see Legally Blonde: Red, White, and Blonde instead - at least you'll laugh at something you're supposed to."
3,"Good Film, But Is It T2 or T3?","T3...or is it T2 with the plot reworked? All through this film I felt that I was watching an alternate version of T2. With the same basic plotline. Arnnold sent back to protect John Conner from another, more sophisticated Terminator....sound familiar? Yeah, I thought so too. Once agin the CGI and effects are spectacular as would be expected, and the acting is good (Albeit Arnold's Terminator sometimes seems a little too human.)Of course, we welcome beautiful newcomer Kristanna Loken to the screen (WOW!) Overall I give this film 3 stars, although it could perhaps be a 3.5 instead. Definitely worht checking out."
1,I WANT TO BE ALONE......,EVER noticed how similar the two voices are - Garbo and Arnold?Such missed fun - if only this director introduced a smattering of humor - like the opening Chippendales section with our Arnie and look-alike - ? NOT that we want the missed Zucor Brothers - but it could have been such fun.... right?Then there's the femme fatale - except for the semi-Kama Sutra gyration near the end with Arnie - nuffin much here... and the heroinne? The original miss was replaced 'cause she was slightly too young - Miss Danes {a superior talent wasted here - wasts her time on this milque-toast young'un]Must add - great chase sequences though - the crane section - but like the metallic miss - it's all in the toilet from there on ....Stick to Cameron's unsurpassed T2 - perfect - missing Linda H.
3,AWFULL!,"I thought I'd give this movie a chance so I did. I was so let down. It takes what you had in T2 then rips the story apart, sets it on fire, and whatever wasn't destroyed by the fire they put in the movie. Bonus featuers and extra content a good though so I guess it was a good deal for $8.00.Picture Quality: 9/10Sound Quality: 8/10Extra Content: 9.5/10Movie itself: 5.5/10Overall: 8/10"
3,Blu Ray Disc Errors,"This Blu Ray Disc shows at max resolution 1080i not 1080p... Warner should be fixing the error in its next release. For some reason, the output is shown at 1080p only when the pip feature is activated. The issue is not a big deal unless you have a really large TV with 1080p."
3,Apparently our fate is not our own to make...,"With the loss of James Cameron as director, the core of the Terminator storyline seems to have disappeared. At least in the second movie the line ""no fate but what you make"" became a major theme... apparently John Connors character was just messing with his young self giving him false hope, because the war still happened. While a great summer flick, and definitly a Terminator movie (lots of people get Terminated) I feel that the franchise has gone the way of the Star Wars and the Matrix, and lost that sense of itself that was so appealing."
3,Worth Watching...I guess...,"The movie was going great (worth watching) but just don't get the ending, that's all. Part II and III is MORE worthy.Anyway the movie is about a robot wanting to stop a evil robot from killing humans, while some couple of the people (humans) has to try prevent Judgement Day to happened."
5,Great DVD and a Fantastic Terminator film,"I am a huge Terminator fan, and when i saw T3 in theaters, i was blown away. It surpassed all my expectations. The audio and picture quality on this DVD is jaw dropping. The extras are pretty good for a standard release.I actually prefer this one to T2, and it is tied with T1 as the best T-film. The acting was excellent, the story was great,the action/special effects were amazing, and the ending was nothing short of fabulous. Bring on T4 and the T3 Ultimate Edition DVD!!"
1,Uggghhhh,"This is by far the worst of the Terminator series. It has almost no story, no character development, horrible humor (the gay strip club scene made me cringe in horror), it was just a piss poor movie. With out James Cameron at the helm it went downhill fast, the story (the little tiny bit there was) was just one 2 hour long chase scene, the acting by everybody but Arnold was piss poor, the special effects weren't as good as in T2, again this is a very bad movie, do not buy this movie.Anybody praising this movie has no idea what makes a good movie, period. I'm sure if you liked T3 you probably also loved New York Minute with the Olsen twins, and any Barney movie."
2,Not up to Stirling's Novels,"First off, Edward Furlong (sp?) was a much better young John Connor. Furlong is easily old enough to be cast as the older John Connor now... Second, for future scenes, don't slap makup on the idiot they cast this time, re-use the same older John used in T2. Aging a babyfaced actor doesn't work well.Arnie and the new Terminatrix were good. It was fun seeing Arnie doing a different Terminator and the lady playing the Terminatrix was quite good at her part.However, the missing Linda Hamilton was lousy. The different actor playing John was lousy.It was obvious that James Cameron wasn't driving this movie...it was missing his dark, but ironic, flavor. The ending was good, as far as the whole radio and 1960's military facility thing goes...S. M. Stirling did a series of sequels to T2...much better writing and concepts.this was a sad a sequel as Lethal Weapon 4."
3,"BIG, LOUD, FAST & FUN","Ten years have passed, can a now inferior Terminator still save John Connor and prevent the apocalypse?Governor Schwarzenegger's unstoppable cyborg in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (Warner) worked the box office like his political campaign: despite criticism, a big unexpected win.The digital version of the once bad but now good robot from the future has lots of extras including a sometimes eyebrow raising commentary from Arnold.The dangerous action sequences are big and loud and beautifully staged (the budget was reputed to be north of $170 million) and the story satisfies (unlike the two dreadful Matrix sequels).A fun, fast ride. So rare that a sequel delivers with fresh material that satisfies."
2,Another empty shell of a movie.,"Well, Well, Well, where do I start? I completely love the first and expecially the second Terminator movie. Sadly the third incarnation is a complete joke. The film completely fails to reel me in. The acting, humor, dialogue, and some actors are inadequate and simplistic. The plot is, basically, nearly the same as T2 and the music does not add momentum to the scenes. By the way, The machines must realize that going back in time will not change the future outcome simply because the time travel events are a direct result of the future events and they cannot be altered (it is a paradox). Overall: BAD."
2,Great action film but a poor story line,"I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan so I am doing this review without being bias. The movie had great action sequences, special effects and stunts. I think the story lacked some detail in linking all the ends form the original movie and T2 to the new T3 plot. I think T3 ruined the Terminator movies."
5,Terminator 3: Rise of the Classic,"Banking success once again, the Terminator 3 movie was fantastic. With an invigorating blend of humor, suspense, action, and landmark special effects, it is sure to become the newest member of the memorable Terminator series. T-X with her chilling performance as a killing machine gives us a glimpse into what our heroes will have to face in their apocalyptic future and emphasizes the obstacles humankind will have to overcome to survive.Again, great movie, and I can't wait to see what kind of surprises this series will turn up with next."
4,Great sequel!,I took a day off from work just to see this. It was a great sequel and well worth the money to see it in the theater. I will not summarize the plot since everyone else has but will just say SEE THE MOVIE! Great action....excellent chase scenes....fulfills all of your expectations for a Terminator movie.Yay!
1,Bad to the Bone,"This movie sucks. It's a horrible parody of T2 and has nothing original in it whatsoever. Everything is taken from the first two flicks and given a 'spin' (not really) to make fresh. The humour is horrible and mocks the legacy of the two 'real' Terminator films. ie)Elton John shades on the Terminator.The special effects were terrible CGI graphics (in the behind the scenes interview on the T2 DVD Stan Winston says the big problem with films today is all the computer effects - he uses them ONLY when they can't be done another way. But here it's ALL CGI all the time and it's all terrible.)The uninventive story plods along, missing the boat in almost every scene. There's no real dramatic arc in this film and it completely misses the point of the second with its resonant theme of the value of human life. There are no such themes here -just boring, unimaginative action scenes that land with a dull thud.I'm glad Arnie is now governor because he hasn't made a good movie in TEN YEARS."
1,Arnold looks really old,This movie was such a letdown. I loved the first 2 movies but this one was awful. Don't bother with this one.
3,Arnold is the only highlight of this film...,"Too bad James Cameron sat out on this one,....it could have been great. First off, the movie was somewhat entertaining, provided by Arnold and the mega-star that he is. But there were alot of problems......first of all, the missing links(edward furlong, linda hamilton, james cameron)in this movie foretold its future, straight to popcorn heaven.If I wanted to make T3 and Cameron would not direct it, I would stop right there. If ed furlong was unavailable to reprise his role as ""john connor"", I would stop right there. But the brains behind this movie took an action classic and turned it into kid fluff with no depth to the script and too many one-liners. Arnold is THE ONLY reason to watch this movie."
3,OK action film let down by an overall air of familiarity,"""T3 - Rise of The Machines"" is a decent entry in the big, dumb action (BDA) movie genre. Nick Stahl adds depth to the role of John Connor - future leader of the resistance and Claire Daines is pretty good as his love interest Catherine Brewster but Governor Schwartzenegger's acting has not improved - even playing a robot (the ""good"" termininator) - and Kristina Loken makes a memorable if rather one-note ""bad"" terminator. The film has all the stunning special effects and spectacular stunts you would expect in a BDA but the main problem the film can never quite overcome is an overall air of familiarity."
4,Rise of The Machines,"I enjoyed watching the 3rd installment in the terminator series. This movie had a lot of action and was quick paced. As far as sequels go, this sequel is great as it takes the storyline to the next step.... which is that the machines do start a nuclear holocaust no matter how hard John & Sarah Connor attempted to prevent Judgment Day from occurring in the past.I can only speculate that a ""Terminator 4"" may possibly be made in the future in order to see the aftermath of the nuclear fallout and how John Connor actually leads the remaining human population in an uprising against the machines that have taken over the world. So, let's hope ""Terminator 4"" is made into a movie to complete the story."
4,Explanation of the new Terminator,"I want to address some people's criticism that the new Terminator was initially a liquid metal, and then became an endoskeleton machine. You may remember from T2 that Robert Patrick could form knives, axes, etc. Arnold explains to John Conner that the terminator of T2 can not form chemicals, moving parts.Ms. Lokken's Terminator had weapons built into her hands, and that required an endoskeleton. So she was a hybrid of Arnold's type, and Robert Patrick's type. An endoskeleton with a liquid metal skin."
5,So Amazingly Well Done.,"You can get thrilled in this awesome movie. The Chase scenes are really amazing too like where he hits the fire truck and ARNOLD says""I'll Drive"" And final thing , after he takes the guy at the BarParty full of women,He puts on these sunglasses with stars and he felt like this ""VERY FUNNY"" Congragulations Mr.Arnold Schwarzenegger."
4,Should Have Been Titled: Terminator: Rise of the Machines,"This movie is quite entertaining in its own right without reference as the second sequel. Previous reviewers criticism and praise are all valid, but this movie should just be accepted on its own terms as running ""full circle"". The weakest aspect is the casting of John Connor and his prospective ""mate"", but it's still entertaining after all!"
2,Another cash-in movie,"T-3 was decent. It was worth seeing but I wasn't impressed. Oddly enough Arnold's acting wasn't very convincing. (Normally I'm an Arnold fan) The action was good but there were so many things that were way out of proportion and they tried too hard to think up new ""cool"" ideas for the latest model terminator.I have to admit Kristana Token (the TX) did a good job acting out the character. Aside from her being drop-dead gorgeous, she was convincing and cold-hearted as they come! What a woman...."
2,bored of the machines,"but wait a minute ??????????wow man, that machine is still alive, in florida i guess...hope he stays there instead of being back...now we can't call him an eswhole anymore :)"
2,Not worthy to own..i mean it,"I rented yesterday the movie to proof that it will not going to be better than T2 and exactly. There some scenes with stupid ""jokes"" if we can say joke at, like Arni getting the stupid sunglass. I expected a serious drama. I only enjoyed whe short moment when the endoskeletons are marching and shooting (reminds me T2, thats a movie), the chase scene and the ending."
1,Cinema History,"This Film created Cinema History for me :- Being the first film I have ever walked out of half way through. Pathetic Acting & Patheticly Weak dialogue. Not just a simple ""let down"" but a degradation of the whole franchise. Cant believe people liked this film!!!"
1,Waste of film and time,"Neither Furlong, (who was never offered the part) or Hamilton, (who found the script to be souless), were in this film.It should not have been named Terminator 3... as it does not further the story line of the first two wonderful films.This film was made to line the pockets of those who know the public will go out and watch just about any piece of crap on screen."
1,Maybe if it was $5 with free shipping....,I might consider it just to make a loud noise with my sub woofer. Otherwise all I can say I already got suckered in at the theatre and once is enough. Might rent it if I was really bored. This movie is just plain bad. Bad plot..Bad acting....Real bad ending. The terminator should have stayed terminated.
3,Never saw this,From what I hear this movie was ok. This is a case where my fiancee likely rented this when I went to bed or something.
3,Depresssing Ending!,"Robots taking over the world thanks to an evil supercomputer. The way technology is going, I could see this very possibly happening. The only problem is, what would the robots do with the world after they take it over and kill all humans?This was the 1st terminator movie that I have seen that was in the theatres. My only other terminator experience was T2: 3D that's at the Universal theme parks, but the movie didn't have the most complex storyline, and I knew the basics, so I figured out most of it. How was the movie? The special effects were great. Industrial Light and Magic did it again. Besides from that, the dialogue was weak, the story was very predictable, and they told you what would happen next in the movie constantly so there were no suprizes. It also seemed like Arnold wrote himself out of the series if they do make a next one by killing his robot self and the world was basically destroyed at the end of the movie."
4,WOW LOT'S OF ACTION!!! NOT TO MUCH PLOT!!,I was very impressed with all the action in this movie. The graphic were very nice as well. There was some intensity during the begining & little near the end. Overall there was not to much plot. I recommend this movie only if you want a hard core action flik. NOT A KIDS MOVIE!!
4,I like it,"The trailer was quite disappointing, and I thought there were nothing new in the plot. I accepted I was wrong. The movie came out better than I thought. A lot of questions in T2 were answered, but they still left themselves room to make T4. Don't expect too much from the new special effects. Anyway that was offset by the nonstop action from the begining till the end--I felt the same way as when I watched ""the Speed."" Arnold's tradmark humour was still evident in the movie. All the new faces did their job pretty impressively. If you don't compare T3 with T2, I'm sure you will love this movie!"
2,dissappointing...,Why on earth would you do that? Everyone knew that T2 could not be topped. So why would you want to leave the Teminator legacy like that. That was like MJ playing for the Wizards after retirement. What for? It wasnt worth it. Maybe the money was made but the movie was horrible in contrast to 1 and 2. You could have at least kept the same actors for characters from the previous movies to this one.
1,Wasted the whole Terminator story.,"I never liked Jonathan Mostow's films. All his films aren't like movies, but rather like some very low budget TV special. This is suppose to be a great scale movie, but I never feel any grandness while watching it.There is absolutely no character development in the movie. The John Connor character in this movie could have been played by just anybody under this script and director. Obviously Jonathan Mostow aren't the type of director that pay much attention to details, which become his major failure as a director.I wish other directors could have directed this film instead of Jonathan Mostow. I wouldn't even mind watching James Cameron direct another Terminator movie once again. Atleast I am pretty sure he won't let us down. (None of his movies have ever let me down)"
1,sad,I gave this movie 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. This movie should have been awesome. I don't care how great the special effects are. If the story is bad... it's a bad movie. These guys messed with a classic series that should have been handled with much more thought and care. Those who have said that it made T2 pointless are absolutely right. I could have cried when the Matrix sequels turned out to be so lousy. The new Star Wars movies had the same effect on me. Now Terminator. I think I may be done with sequels. Let these great films go out in a blaze of glory instead of beating them to death.
2,no no no,This movie shouldn't have been made. Cheesy jokes in a movie that shouldn't contain any type of joke. Many unrealistic actions. Bad acting. Bad story. Bad action. They should have made it more simplistic like the first two Terminator movies. Whoever wrote and directed this movie killed Terminator.
5,I'd watch this again if it didn't cost money,"Terminator 3 is great! The effects, the action, the humor, the thrill, and the most fascinating twists in the entire store line were amazing. They appear to be keeping consistent with Time Theory. However, the ending was a bit sad and apocalyptic, the movie was great overall.Truthfully, I probably would have waited until the movie was on DVD before watching if Kristanna Loken wasn't in it... hehe I still remember her from the days of the Mortal Kombat tv series."
3,Not Much New,"Honestly, I had no great expectations for this film after it was released. Sure, it is an action film and it lives up to that; however, I was sad to see what they had done with the whole thing. The most interesting part of the movie was the end. Everything was like a repeat of T2; shooting police cars with a machine gun, the cars chase, the terminator fight scene, and although a little different, the female villain.I wish they had stared the move where it ended and get into the real good stuff, and then it would have a more appropriate title, ""T3-The Rise & Fall of the Machines""I'm now keeping my fingers crossed that T4 which I believe will take place in the war torn world will be much better. I really missed the dark tone, and serious atmosphere of the first film in which the terminator was actually scary.Now, as I mentioned earlier, if you're looking for a high action film, then sure this is for you, but don't be expecting too much if you're a fan of the Terminator."
2,Are you kidding me???,"I fell asleep halfway through the movie.The action sequences are stretched out too much and is so over the top I could not help but laugh.The previous two movies were excellent (T1 is in my opinion the best of them all), but this movie should either have been directed by James Cameron or nobody at all. The first Terminator movie back in 1984 was dark, disturbing, violent and amazingly believable. T2 gave us more insight into the story, but T3 seem to ponder from one action sequence to another without any rhyme or reason. The only part in the movie where I actually felt a connection with the other two movies was when Arnold aknowledged that he killed John Connor.Otherwise I was very disappointed with the movie."
1,T3: Rise of the Bore,"Why do I need to see the few hours before Skynet goes haywire? It's already been explained what happens. I don't need to see it damnit. Terminator 3 should have been set during the war. I want to see the freakin' war already. And none of this CGI nonsense. Cameron is the only director for Terminator. No new directors trying to take over. They just destroy good things. I don't need to hear about The Rock playing in T4. That only proves the series is going downhill. I just want to see the war, who wins, and how. I don't need to see a few hours before the bombs have been sent."
1,Pass on this movie,"I really wanted to like this movie, having been a fan of the previous two. Unfortunately the dialog is very weak (Arnolds best lines are the ones taken from his previous movies), the acting is weaker and the actors lack the chemistry that was present in the previous two.If want to see it for the special effects, than by all means go for it. Just don't expect anything more than that.I have to give this movie a solid ""D"", and that is being generous."
2,2 stars and you're lucky i gave it that...,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because Kristanna Loken is super hott...thats the only upside to this movie. Everything else is thumbs down. The acting is horrible, the story is bad...well, everything is bad really. Don't waste your time or money on this unless you want to see Kristanna Loken semi-naked."
2,Terminator 3,This just the industry trying to make a buck on past successes. The Extra features were good for references and explaining chronology and contents of the previous movies.
3,TERMINATOR 3: Rise of the machines ( Blu-ray ),Tranfers of the movie is not as fantastic as terminator 2 : skynet edition. my samsung blu ray player unable to shut down down the movie after completing the entire movie watching.
5,THE BEST MOVIE THIS YEAR!!,"This movie is by far the best movie made this year... I think have a women as the bad terminator is a very good idea. She does a fabulous job acting a long with Arnold. This movie is friggin halarious and the action sceens are amazing and realistic. I like that in this terminator movie, they really prove that the 2 robots are machines. The other one they mainly use the idea that they can withstand bullets to show that they are robots. In this one, they damage a car if they jump on it, they break concreate if they fall on the ground, arnold bends metal with ease. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE AND I HAVE SEEN IT 4 TIMES in the theatures..."
2,The ending ruins it,"From the moment Arnold says ""You're terminated,"" this picture falls apart. There are several places in the picture where you wonder if the screenwriters even saw the first two films, though you tend to ignore them because Arnold and the other actors are doing good work, and the setpiece destruction is well-staged. But you do notice Skynet's takeover. That was described in T2, and it's not what happens in T3. Then we are asked to believe a father outright lies to his daughter with his dying breath. That leads to an ending that is totally in violation of the series' premise (till now) -- a saying repeated in both films: ""The future is not set. Our future is what we make of it."" This picture's premise is: ""The future IS set, and there's nothing we can do about it."" Maybe if all this had been set up it would have worked, though I doubt it. You can't change core tenets of a film series and have it work. T3 does just that, and it doesn't work."
5,"The BEST YET, Go SEE It NOW","The story is just as good as the other 2, and the special effects, even better. The liquid metal shots to the chest don't look like cheap plastic like in 2. Kristanna Loken(TX)is so freaking good looking. Arnold still one of the best cyborgs ever in science fiction. The movie is just beyond words in my mind. Go SEE THE MOVIE NOW, AND BE TRAPPED IN THE WORLD OF JOHN CONNOR."
4,Classic Arnold!!!,Rise of the Machines was just as much fun to watch as the first two. The Governator had a machine gun and he was shooting it. Plus his face was practically ripped off leaving only his metalic skull showing. What more do you want? T3 had intense robot battles and lots of high tech special effects. I myself am not too big on tons and tons of computer generated images. The CGI and the fact that the movie was a bit slow at times lead to me giving it a 4 out 5. But the fights are awesome and the intensity is high. I think Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines fits nicely with the other two and I am hoping for a T4. Plus the ending rocks!
1,Biggest disappointment ever!!!,"If I could give this movie a lower rating I'd do it, it deserves more of a 0.16 of a star. This movie was horrible, not a good ending at all, the casting was fair, but not great. The graphics were so-so, but not as good as I expected & hoped. This movie by far (besides Gigli) has to be the biggest disappointment. I wish it would've flopped in the box office, but like idiots we go see it & leave in shock of the suckiness that took place. When the movie ended you were like ""that's it, that sucked."" I don't care if you vote that this review wasn't helpful, you know it was, because deep down inside (if you saw the movie) that it sucked terribly, admit it, & vote that I was helpful...horrible movie, one of the worst..."
2,Not good.,"This movie wasn't terrible. It was about on par with your average big-budget summer blockbuster. But as pointed out by other reviewers, the plot is lacking. Considering the special effects capability of modern film, they could have done a much more entertaining film by making a precursor - a grim future where the humans fight to send Kyle Reese back to protect Sarah Connor would have been interesting, at least. This film feels more like a rehash of the second movie, with only minor deviations from that plotline (take the same terminator, send it after John Connor, but this time instead of knives and stabbing weapons, give it a gun, and make it female). I'd call it the worst in the terminator series. I still bought it just to own the triology, but as a standalone film its just not very good."
2,Same old stuff,"Lots of special eefect, women in sexy outfits and Arnolds dumb one-liners. I actually slow in some parts. No fun at all."
1,Terminator? - Crapinator!,"Seriously, my only real complaint with this movie is the special effects. T2 was made over 10 years ago, and still looks like one of the best FX jobs on the plannet. Ever. I thought at least for T3 they'd have realized this high standard and tried to compete with it. Through the whole move I was flinching from the half-assed production. I'm thinking that most of the $170+ million, or whatever it was, went to Arnie. So they turned post production over to the local computer club, gave them $50, and said ""Please make this look decent. It's all the money we have!""Enough ranting I guess, the rest of the movie is decent, and even slightly unpredictable. You can see influences from the other Terminator movies, and from other movies that this mutha would be competing with. Still... digital effects (especially crummy ones) can't save a movie."
1,AUTSCH!,"First of all, dont expect too much!As a big fan of Terminator 1 + 2, i was absolutely dissapointed of Terminator 3. This Movie has a lot of cool actionscenzes but the soul of the terminator movies was not included. Jonathan Mostow did a bad job. Because of... I dont remember that the Terminator was a clown!?!? There were too many jokes the Terminator did speak out...I expect from a Terminator movie a serious Killermachine without joking, like in the Part 1 + 2! That was a big mistake wich Jonathan Mostow did. He didnt realise that this is a Killermachine and not a Clown!!!!!Anyhow..this movie has a lot of cool actionscense/SFX and the story was OK! Alltogehter this movie is dissapointing ...for a NONE TERMINATOR FAN, this movie could be interessting..Hopefully T4 (2006) will be much better..."
2,Disappointing,"Why didn't they use Edward Furlong as John Conner in this film?????? He was the right age and everything. Furlong is handsome with a dangerous edge (like John Conner). Instead they cast Nick Stahl, the goofiest, goofiest, dorkiest actor in the history of cinema. Nick Stahl makes Ben Stiller look like Sean Connery. They poured hundreds of millions of dollars into making and marketing this film...and ruined it from the get-go with a wretchedly moronic casting choice."
2,Arnold Must have needed the campaign money,"I thought this movie was terrible. The first 2 Cameron movies were very dark, which this movie lacked. The humor was ridiculous and not typical Arnold humor.""Talk to the Hand"" Was one of the most pathetic lines I have ever seen in a movie. You may think that was funny if you were in 2nd grade. Sure there was some action, but if I wanted action I would rather watch Bad Boys II. The story was very weak and I believe most of the original actors did not come back because this script lacked any kind of substance.(except Arnold, he needed the campaign money) Sure Claire Daines is pretty good but the actor who played john connor was aweful. The only good thing about this movie was the The Hot Terminator. Save your money. Let sleeping dogs die."
1,How to ruin a good movie series in 4 steps -,"1. you have only 1 original character return to the series. 2. You kill off the 2nd main character (sara connor). 3. You replace the 3rd important character (sara's son) with an actor so bland your praying he gets terminated quickly. 4. Then shoot the whole mess in someone's back yard without the spectacular special effects that made this series so watchable. I'll never know why Arnold didn't insist that the original cast be reunited one last time to finish off the story intact. Well, whatever, I'm sure it was a money/greed decision. I rarely like these kind of movie series, but, this one had heart and personality. Too bad and too sad."
3,"Notice to everybody interested in the ""PiP"" commentary...","Edit: For once warner actually heard the voices of America and did something about that mess. I received a replacement blu ""fixed"" of those problems. I am giving it an extra star for that!If you use that, it's the only way to watch the show in 1080p. If you just played it, it'll go straight into 1080i! I really regret this purchase and wait a response from warner on that issue."
2,Please use the same characters,"The big problem with the 3rd part of this series is the original characters should have been in this. It almost seemed like a different movie without the original cast. I don't know why, maybe they wanted too much money, but, I think this particular installment fell flat because of that reason. Too bad, because I really liked this series, and I'm not a big fan of Sci-Fi movies in particular."
4,This movie rocked!!!,"This Terminator is worth watching,filled with action,explosives and stunts,theres only one thing I hate bout this movie and I tell why.The only thing I hated bout this movie is the the title has nutthin to do with the movie,no machines came out until the end,the starting rising like in the last 2 seconds of the film,the only machines I saw rising was the original Terminator,and they had like 2.The movie is excellent,but the only machines u will be seeing in this movie is Arnold and theT-X.This movie is worth watching, TRUST ME."
3,Action Packed.,"Not being a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I hadn't seen the previous Terminator movies. I have to say that this movie wasn't all that bad. John Connor, now an adult, is living in fear of the events that took place at a young age. On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit, the T-X, (Kristanna Loken) arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, that is sent back by the human resistance."
4,GOVERNOR'S BALL?,"You have to give Arnold credit---as he ages, he does so gracefully and although the lines and wrinkles on his face are noticeable, he manages to have a pretty buff body for a California governor. Director Jonathan Mostow, who gave us ""Breakdown"" sets the pace extremely well in this no-nonsense, shoot em up, bang em up thriller. Beautiful Kristina Lokken is a formidable foe for Arnie in this one, and she evinces both the menace and heartlessness of this killing machine sent back from the future to try and kill good old John Connor (Nick Stahl, this time). Claire Danes as a pretty veterinarian assistant gets hooked into the fray, and it's non-stop action from there on. Although this is an excellently done movie (the effects are mind-boggling), it may be time to retire this series, as it seems Connor is at the point in the movie where it all started a century ago!!! But undeniably a butt-kicker!"
4,blasphemy! sequals are not supposed to be this good.,"Movies are like teabags, each sequel following is like reusing the teabag over and over; it loses its flavor. T3 fails to do so. Much like the terminators themselves we are left with a nigh-indestructable teabag that is cybernetically enhanced for your iced or hot tea enjoyment.Instead of rehashing old stories, T3 adds to the future-history of the series, filling in old blanks and introducing intriguing new characters, i.e. Claire Dane's character (she acted remarkably good here), as well as our favorite master of disaster 'AH-nold'. He retakes his old role of tin-head with a heart, while adding an sinister new twist to the mix.Altogether an entirely enjoyable ride. Lipton, be forewarned."
5,Buy It !!!,"I Saw and Have TERMINATOR and T2, and I also have the DVD's of Both ,Including the First release of the Special Edition ( Actually 2 copies, one unopened in a Metal Case, and the one I use in a Silver Cardboard Pack).I thoroughly Enjoyed T3.It's all Set up for a Franchise, and with any Luck Either Arnold, or someone else ( Please God not the ""Rock"") Will Carry on the Series.Hopefully the Script and Director for T4 will be better, but... It's a Blast, and the Sergeant Candy scene is full on funny.No Deep Meaning, just a Standard set of Blow em up, shoot em out fun."
4,"If you like Arnold, read this!!!","Terminator 3- rise of the machines is better than terminator and terminator 2- judgement day, because there is more action, more gore, more of everything a movie needs in order for a watcher to enjoy it. If you like Arnold Swarzenneger, you would like this hollywood movie!!! BUT, this movie has some neggatives in it too- like the man the terminatrix after is a real wimp, in the 2nd one he was tough, but in this one he just wanted to give-up. Arnold is on the humanity side, and the terminatrix is the evil machine, in this movie the evil one is a female type cyborg. Scary, Rated-R, wouldn't reccomend for children under 13If you want to know more... Buy that DVD from Amazon.com where it's always cheap!!!"
1,Terminator 3,I have not and will not be able to view this product as it is an HD DVD. I don't know if I ordered it that way or you just sent it that way. There are no HD DVD players due to Blue Ray. If you have this product in regular DVD format. Please let me know.
3,It's okay,"I know that this does not match the other Terminator movies.The plot laggs a lot more and it only gets repetitive.They added humor and lost some story.Character acting is not that good, but then there are some good actors (mainly the terminators).The animation and stuff is very good, but it didn't feel like a terminator movie.Rent it before buying.One thing is for sure, T1 and T2 far outmatch this sequel."
3,Come into my life,"This movie is not as good as the first too,but it wasn't too shabby either. I thought they could have found a hotter chick to play brewster. I thought t-x was hot. Arnold could have looked a little younger. All in all i think this movie was pretty good."
5,Not a cash in!,"This film should have failed but I was glad to be proven wrong. It is a roller coaster ride that simply will not stop and director Jonathan Mostow perfectly balanced incredible stunts while never insulting the intelligence of the audience by asking them to believe something stupid like the bus jump from Speed. The acting is good and Arnold is even more dark and scary than in the other films. The special effects are simply the best. As soon as it was over I wanted a T4, as long as Jonathan Mostow directs. Also the story is moved forward nicely and leaves much room for a future war sequel. I'm going to see it again tomorrow!"
5,Arnold is Back! So am I!,"""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is the best thing that's happened all year since Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor of California! Blissful nirvana has been achieved with this masterpiece! As Aristotle himself said, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Prime Mover of all things. He is the definition of deification! A female robot called the T-X (Kristanna Loken) was sent back in time to rid John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his future rebel officers. Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) is along for the ride to prevent judgment day from happening. But, as the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) said, the future is inevitable. Caskets slung over one shoulder and a machine gun in the other hand, pure lordage. Destruction reigns in the city and this movie is awesome. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a proprietor of the galaxy!"
3,"Seriously, just enjoy it...","Here's a word of advice, seriously kids, don't think about it too much. Forget about the hows and whys, scratch common sense, and ditch the confused urge to say, ""But...?"" In fact, get rid of gravity and physics altogether while you're at it. With that said, 90% of the movie watching populace will, grudgingly or not, enjoy T3. This is an action flick and, let's be honest, this movie wasn't made to make a whole lot of sense or be an important contribution to filmaking. James Cameron has left the helm of this series and with him taken the vision and the passion for the story that was reflected in the two far superior predecessors to T3. This 3rd installment, hopefully of a trilogy, is enjoyable fun. The action is literally non-stop so there's no point complaining about dialogue being simplistic because there isn't much of it anyway. T3 is a lot better than it could have been so let's all put this movie into the proper context in which it belongs and enjoy the saucy ride."
2,Overrated,"T3 was a mockary of the other terminater movies. this story is on a serous subjuct, and the other movies show this though the darkness of the movies, yet t3 is full of bad jokes. At least the did give a decent explanation as to why the could happen, though why would they send such an outdated version of the terminatior back? basically the movie was just arnold's poor attempt to renew a dying career, hopefully he does better as governor"
5,HE'S BACK!!!!!,"This time, a relentless female cyborg is bent on terminating not only ""John Conner"", but his lieutenants who will lead the battle for survival of mankind, against the machines. John Connor is now a young man, coming of age- on the run, trying to stay one step ahead of his fate. Enter Arnold Schwartzenegger as the defending machine slugging it out with the female cyborg assasinator. This is yet another razzle dazzle sci-fi action flick with the ususal special effects marathon chase scenes. Arnold manages to keep John alive, barely. This cast does a superb job. Hard to top Linda Hamilton's performances in the previous terminator films, but new young heroes give it their all. What will the next film, Terminator 4, reveal as Judgement Day begins in earnest?"
3,lotsa explosions,"This movie came quite a while after the second one was made, and to be honest, this movie simply doesn't add as much to the story. The first and second were awesome. I can't say this installment was bad or anything, but the story wasn't as tight as the first two, and felt rather unneeded.One thing I can say is that there's lots of explosions and property damage, so if you're the kind of person who likes seeing that, then you WILL enjoy this movie. There's a memorable scene where they're driving a truck with an arm and the arm drags along and destroys so many things as the truck is driving along, and it's quite the visual to see, or where Terminator and the female Terminator are fighting in the bathroom at the army base and they pretty much tear everything up - urinals, sinks, toilets, walls. Freaking awesome.This movie serves more as visual candy than a solid story, so it's not for everyone. Still, I enjoyed it, if not as much as the first two."
4,cyborg vs cyborg,"Great science fiction flick with its special effects. Gov. Schwarzenegger gave a convincing portrayal of a robot cutting down the enemy of human race. Watching all three films, makes you wonder if this were a true story of time, he could possibly save mankind."
3,Great looking movie - felt like a tv show/same story as T2,"Movie looks great - very crisp/clear on Blu-Ray player and plasma tv.It felt a little like a tv show/movie rather than a theatrical movie like the first two. Not sure what about it made it feel like that, but it was there.....Pretty much the same story as T2 - Arnold is zapped back in time, heads to a bar, gets come clothes heads out to protect someone....meanwhile another terminator (more advanced, just like T2) also is zapped to earth, commandeers a vehicle, and starts hunting down people....where have we heard this before?Overall I did enjoy it, but a little ""freshening"" up of the story would have been nice."
3,"Average, not as good as the first or second","In short, it was entertaining but the actors (besides Arnold) did a poor job compared to the acting done in the first or second. I thought the first movie was much more ominous, suspenseful, and frightening, too. Terminator 3 suffers from Hollywood's obsessive desire to turn what could be a great thriller into a romantic, expensive, and vacuous action movie."
2,Overall verdict: Letdown.,"Overall, Jonathon Mostow's directing is good. But this movie fails from the script more than anything else. It lacks everything that James Cameron would have included: the heart, the humanity, etc. James could not have written a script this bad if you sawed his head in two. Also, the acting is mediocre at best and there are a number of plot holes. And the over-use of cheesey comedy is often noticeable -- at times I felt like I was watching a MadTV spoof on the Terminator films.I am very let down by this movie -- you you should be too."
4,"As expected, great effects, story line is an after-thought","Really great effects and sound that will truly test your home theater quality. The storyline suffered until the second half of the movie when the Terminator starts filling in the pieces on what's going on and why. Then there is a bit of a surprise at the end that in hind-sight fits the movie. Overall, get the movie because of the effects, not because of a storyline, this way you won't be disappointed when a minor one shows up."
3,Decent movie...in Spanish?,"So I ordered this because apparently there are 2 different transfers of the Blu-Ray and I wanted the best looking one. That part wasn't the issue, I received the correct transfer, however, the box art had dual languages on it. English and Spanish. It's not a huge deal, but the product was not described as such anywhere on the page. Plus it looks a little out of place on my shelf."
4,"Lots of action, thrills and incredible effects!","This movie was made when directors still cared about making the impossible seem real! The story isnt up to par with one and two, but the action almost makes up for it!"
3,as a Terminator fans comment,"The movie story is nice, overall is okay. But maybe James Cameron was too good, make me feel the movie a little bit disappointed.now the blu ray comment, video I can accept but the audio only dolby digital 5.1 &#65306;&#65288;"
3,"Not one of the best, but isn't worse in the series",Enjoyable movie that helps to better explain various aspects of the overall movie story. Schwarzenegger still works some movie magic in it as well.
2,"Been there, done that","Clearly T3 was expected to revive an old franchise, as well as the sagging career of Arnold Schwarzenegger. In both respects, it fails miserably. The film is, however, well directed, with crisp action sequences that are very well choreographed. It is both the source material and the acting that fall flat. Every key performance in this film is flat and uninspired, from Schwartzenegger on down. The script is also uninspired, failing to break very much new ground and rehashing virtualy every cliche from the first two films.While the first film broke new ground in its science fiction detail and the second film broke new ground with its dazzling special effects, this film does neither. Basically, if you watch it without giving much thought to what's going on, you may find it to be an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but if you want real entertainment, rent or buy one of the first two movies."
1,A real disappointment!,"I loved the first Terminator film and T2 (seen both multiple time), but T3 - what a disappointment! Aside from a single good chase - there's really nothing interesting at all about the movie. The story and plot were very weak. And only a handful semi-humorous jokes and one-liners, really makes the movie forgetable. The ""terminatrix"" ,although gorgeous, was about as intriguing as Natasha Henstridge (the hot alien character) in the movie ""Species"". I wanted to like the movie but was really let down. If you really have to see it, don't expect much."
4,Get the FULL SCREEN version instead,"I had first seen Terminator 3 dvd in widescreen and I was not impressed. The movie had seemed boring.A couple months later, I watched it again in full screen. What a tremendous difference it was. Everything looked bigger and better!!!! Especially the part where the gigantic crane flips over on the road, almost crushing the terminator into a flat pancake. The bathroom fight scene is also very much improved in the full screen version."
2,More of the elements that ruined the second film.,"Cheesiere and less serious than the second was. The female terminator was rediculous, she couldnt act at all. The plot had huge holes in it. It didn't really work on any level. I liked the first 5 mins and the end result which pushed on to a post judgement day era finally. One the whole it pretty much sux."
1,Stupid movie!,Same old repeat story from T1 and T2.. This is horrible non sense story with alot of foul words... Don't bother to buy this movie because it definitely will waste your time!
3,Its not T1 or T2,This movie is not in the same class as T1 or T2. But that does not mean its a bad movie. It's just not as good as the rest in the series.I enjoyed the movie and had no real issues with where they have taken the story. I think it makes a good companion to the first two. If they make a 4th I just hope they find a different way to bring the terminators in rather that just a few more sent thru time.
2,Watered-down parody,"This is a mediocre movie by any means, less than mediocre compared to The Terminator, and unwatchable compared to Terminator 2. I don't care how many lasers the T-X fires while in that crane truck, the action was no where as riveting as the T2 18-wheeler vs the dirt bike. An utterly uninspiring villian, barely a few threads of plot- many of which unravel once you start asking too many questions . . . (i.e. if Ah-nold has two hydrgen cells in him, why didn't he use one to off the T-1000 in the last movie?)All attempts of humor seemed campier and far less appropriate than the dark humor we have seen in the previous movies.""Talk to da hand!"" ?? where the hell is that coming from?Edward Furlong made the best decision of his life to not be in this movie. If this sequel was ever really worth making, James Cameron would have done it and he would have done it right. This should never had been made."
3,Should he have come back?,"'I'll be back:' good the first and second time, but for the third? Well, I really, really wish that this had turned out to be a better movie. I really enjoyed the first two, but I can understand how they would be hard to top!How many more upgrades can a terminator get? And sheesh, why would it need so many?! The T2 Terminator could have wiped out the humans! Oh well, she did have some cool stuff up her sleeve. :)I didn't really like the choice of actors for John Connor. Too bad Eddie Furlong wasn't hired, at least he would look like him! And he just didn't seem to fit the part. And the part of the Terminator to Arnold, I mean come on...oh wait, just joking.Haha...well, overall, the graphics and action were really cool, and it was neat seeing the other, 'older' versions of the Terminators, but because the story line was weak, the acting a little bad, I just have to give it 3 out of 5.Hopefully, Arnold won't be back for a fourth!"
2,remarkably bad movie,"so sad what they did to this series. should have just left well enough alone. they fight in a bathroom and hit each other over the head with urinals for crying out loud. where the first two ended with a sense of hope, this ends with the end of the world, making everything before a giganto waste of time. yea, arnold looks amazing here, but thats just not enough! WHY!!!"
3,Pretty Good,Terminator 3 was pretty good even tho john conner has kind of lost the tough attitude that he had in the second. it could have had some more action in it but the action scenes were good chase scene is the best part of the movie and does terminator 4 come into play?
1,total trash movie,"Before i start, i would like to mention that i am a big fan of the first two Terminator films.All i respect about this T3 is Arnold and the special effects.1. The acting is crap, apart from Arnold that is2. The plot is too much like T2 and it contradicts the ""judgement day"" theory3. To many jokes overshadowed the threat of a nuclear war4. The TX was not frightening at all5. ""you remind me of my mother"", Save me from those silly one liners, please. The dialogue is funny.6. Johnathan Mostow, you should be very ashamed, and I hope you get shot. LOLNo seriously the film was terrible, A big shame.I won't treat T3 as a sequel, but a ""cash in on the Terminator franchise"" film.I'll be buying Matrix-Reloaded on DVD instead."
2,Best of the series? You gotta be kidding.,"This is the worst Terminator film out of the 3 to date, and the reason is, because it has no depth and is to predictable. T2 was by far the best sequal of any film to date, the story was fresh and the special effects were refreshing. T3 seems to be a desperate attempt to re-start the Terminator story, but it falls well short of expectations. The film also has so many gaffs in it, you lose count. Some of the acting is 3rd rate and the ending, whilst, is probably the its only plus point, does leave you wondering what is next. But if it is as 3rd rate as this sequal, I doubt I will be wasting anytime in seeing it. Incidentally, T3 is already in the discounts bins, and I think that speaks volumes."
1,what were they thinking?!!!,"I am super fan of Terminator and Terminator II but when I watched Terminator III, I was super disappointed. No wonder James Cameron did not participated in this movie.There are few things that were just too hard to bare. 1) Even Arnold hit the gym for this movie, you can totally tell he was an old man. He was sucking up his tommy. 2)Did anybody thought ""Talk to the Hand"" funny? Not me. 3) Is it just me or does anybody else think that John Conner looked like a monkey?...the list goes on.If I were you, I will just rent this movie and return it."
2,"PLEASE! ""DONT COME BACK""","TEMINATER 3 ""RISE OF THE MACHINES"" IS A MOVIE FOR PEOPLE HOLDING THE HOPE OF THE FIRST ONE. THE ONLY THING EXCITING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS HOW HOT TX WAS (KRISSTANA LOKEN). THE PLOT WAS GARBAGE AND SO WAS THE ACTING. AN 80 YEAR OLD ARNOLD IS NOT IMPRESSIVE. THE NOBODY CAST TO THIS MOVIE IS UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE THE TEMINATER. WHERE ARE ALL THE BIG NAMES, OH WAIT THEY READ THE SCRIPT AND DECIDED THEY DID NOT WANT TO BOMB THEIR CAREERS. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY HURT BY THE ABSENCE OF HAMILTON BECAUSE SHE BROUGHT PASSION TO THE MOVIE LIKE NO OTHER PERSON IN THIS MOVIE. SO WITH THIS MOVIE I WILL BLOCK IT OUT ALONG WITH T2 AND PRETEND SARAH CONNER DRIVING OFF IN HER JEEP WITH THAT PICTURE WAS THE END OF THE TERMINATER"
4,So much like the second...,"T2 has a chase with a motorcycle and a semi. T3 has a chase scene with a motorcycle and a crane. T2 opens with Arnold stealing a leather jacket from a thug in a bar. T3 opens with Arnold stealing a leather jacket from a male stripper in a bar. The similarities continue, with T3 making small improvements on a proven action plot. Surprising, however, are the performances of Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. They play unlikely love interests brought together by their inescapable fate. That motif plays well in this movie, as the characters realize they cannot stop the judgement day that has to occur in order for them to exist. There are a lot of special effects and dozens of corner lines, but T3 delivers a fun time and a puzzler of a story if you try to fit the last two movies into this one's future projections. And it ends begging for a T4..."
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie is riddled with inconsitencies, it's the same plot as T2 and the actors are pretty awful.If you are thinking about buying this movie please do not get T2 if you must have one of them in the trilogy. The movie at some points does not make sense example the kid is holding the steering wheel but he never looks at the road. It's pretty awful.rent it first you will see."
1,Why was this film ever made?,"I hate this movie because it manages not only to be terrible in its own right but an insult to the series, that manages to decreases my enjoyment of the other two. I found myself, on numerous accasions, looking away from the screen such was the level of embarressment i felt for the actors. Why was this film made as a flatly unfunny parody of the other two?"
3,T3 made for TV,"Pretty good special effects, loved Claire Danes, but it could have easily become a made-for-tv movie. The dialogue is terrible, even though the plot got a little more interesting in the second half of the movie. Arnold's one liners are about as impressive as his political speeches, and the car chases almost put me to sleep after a while. However, I still will watch again, and as usual the extras are pretty interesting."
3,"Where is the story, where is the music ????","Disappointing movie..., there is no real story to tell, the whole movie has no style, only action scene after action scene, with no character developement. The most disappointing is the music, where is the frightening sounds of the Terminator heart-beat from the T1 and T2 ??? Where is the Terminator theme ??? This is the kind of sequel that is made only for money. Fun, entertaining, action packed, but that is all one can say about this sequel..., it has no real connection with the Terminator line. It's just a faint copy of the Terminator 2: Judgement Day, with the story and music/sounds extracted... I only hope that James Cameron and Brad Fiedel will wake up us from this nightmare and they do ""Terminator 4:War Of The Machines"" or whatever, closing forever this great (except for T3) SCI-FI tech-noir saga.The movie DVD picture and sound is great, but the second disc is very dull, full of comercial crap. Pity..."
2,WAY TO TERMINATE THE FRANCHISE!!!!!!,"BEING A FAN OF BOTH OF THE FIRST FILMS, I WAS EXPECTING A LESS THAN POWERFUL EFFORT FROM THE THIRD FILM. PARTICULARY WHEN I HEARD JAMES CAMERON AND EDWARD FURLONG WERENT INVOLVED. LESS THAN POWERFUL WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DISSAPOINTED THE TERMINATOR SERIES FANATICS WERE WITH TERMINATOR 3 AS ITS SO OVERPRODUCED AND BADLY ACTED, FANS ARE BETTER OFF REWATCHING THE FIRST TWO FILMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NICK STAHL AND CLAIRE DANES ARE BOTH CAPABLE ACTORS BUT JONATHAN MOSTOW IS CERTAINLY NOT A CAPABLE DIRECTOR TO HELM SUCH A FRANCHISE. THE SADEST THING IS NOT SO MUCH THE DISSAPOINTMENT OF THE FILM, BUT THE INCREDIBLY LONG WAIT FANS HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO THIS CRUMMY WORL OF BAD PERFORMANCES AND PLOT ERRORS. I WONT EVEN MENTION THE PATHETIC NEW TX TERMINATOR (KNEW THAT WAS A MISTAKE FROM THE BEGINNING)"
2,T3? All Flash And No Substance,"Typical. The studio apparently thought that the first two movies were blockbusters because of the chase scenes, not the plot or development. So what does the studio do? Cram the movie full of mindless and seemingly endless chase scenes (largely a variation on the first two movies .. the obligatory motorcycle chase, trucks, etc.) tied together with some flimsy pretexts and forget to put in an interesting plot. I thought that this movie was a turkey. Rent the DVD, don't buy it. One viewing is more than enough. And if you saw the movie, you know why not to even bother renting the DVD!"
3,T3 = T2 + 10 years + abit disappointment,"Terminator-3 eventually comes out. Like everybody else, I have been waiting for this movie over 10 years long. But.....a bit disappointed.I purposely re-wateched the previous two termintor movies to refresh myself before going for the brand new exciting T3. Probably the new one is done by a different director and actors, it's not hard to sense the difference of the tone and style in T3. It seems missing some depth of the complex relationship between human & machine. The plot is abit rough & sloppy. The chasing scene is expensive but not thrill & breath-taking as T2 and the one on highway in Matrix Reloaded. But if you're the Arnold big fan, go for it, otherwise, don't expect too much as I did. I hope he'll be back again for T4 with some surprise."
2,T3 Shouldn't Be,"What a major disappointment. A big time Terminator fan, I couldn't wait to buy this DVD. I even marked the date on my calendar. Now I'm sorry that I purchased it at all. The acting all around is atrocious, the dialogue lame. Storyline is passable with some ( emphasize very few) memorable effects although no where near T2's groundbreaking effects. To think that they had 10 years to develop this property. Maybe it's that Cameron's influence is missing but this is one vehicle where Arnold should never have come back."
4,Not as good as the first two.,"Why would it be? Part two was 12 years prior to this film. I went in not expecting a great film and I came out with pretty much what I expected. Not a great movie, but above average at the same time.That's not to say all is good....The new John Conner put a strain on this movie. This kid simply isn't a good actor and it showed here. He's just not very likeable the way Edward Furlong was. Also, Arnolds heart appears to not be totally in this one.The story is not so great. What is good is the action and Arnold still gives the film enough charisma to be good."
4,I'll be back to terminate the director!!!!!!,"This dvd is action packed, with a good story and amazing special effects. There's things in this one that link it to the other two which makes the movie more interesting. BUT!!!! It doesn't have the same feeling behind it like the first and second one did. It doesn't even have the same music like it had at the start of Terminator 1 and 2. They only have two original actors from the 2nd movie. Like Arnold and the main doctor from the psychiatric hospital. That's it!!!!! I know James Cameron didn't direct this movie, the style is not the same. I didn't really like the female robot, her acting wasn't that good. Arnold does it better. There are a lot of good ideas in the movie and they work well but it just doesn't feel the same. Don't get me wrong it's still a good attempt, but I didn't feel satisfied. I bought the movie without renting it, but I'm not disapointed. It's still a good movie. GO BUY IT!!!!!!!"
4,Rize?,Pretty good movie at home. Much better than at the theater!It's amazing how much you actually miss at the theater when you see it.
4,A CLASSIC!!!,"This movie is a classic, even though it's not as good as 1 or 2, but it's definitely worth watching."
3,Really not as good II,"That AI man versus machine War is 'inevitable'?What now seems more likely a a collapseof the oil based infrastructure.What made II special was the acting of Linda Hamilton.In this movie we haven't that child, robotand mother dialog that worked so well.The female android should have been given more'character' and nonviolent interaction: she should have beenmore clever and scheming maybe.This is just a long kind of boring chase moviewith a lot of destruction and very little real plot line?"
4,A great movie and a great HD disc,I went in very skeptical when I first saw Terminator 3. Overall I think it is one of the best action films in the past 10 years or so and a very good edition to the Terminator series. In HD it looks and sounds awesome as can be. The extras are not in HD which is a let down. That is really the only bad thing I can say about this disc. If you like Arnold or Ternimator I highly reccomend this. I wish Terminator 1 and 2 were on HD DVD but they sadly are only on Blu-ray.
2,I didn't like this movie much,"Can anyone tell me the difference between this movie and Matrix Reloaded? Both were movies that needed to be thought out a lot more before producing. After seeing T3, I'm left wondering this:Ok, the first termintor couldn't do it (T1), so they sent a more powerful one (T2) that couldn't do it. Now they're sending an even more powerful (T3) terminator that still can't do it.Let's just skip onto say T19, the baddest momma out. I mean, these things are from the future, right? How come they keep sending ""last year's"" model? Or is George Bush V running skynet?And how come these ""future"" terminators had such a problem with the terminators of the day?Maybe I'd buy into Jason vs Terminator, but I doubt it. C'mon Arnold, give us something fresh. You produced this trash.And do we really need to see his butt anymore? I was hoping we'd get a better look at the other terminator, right???"
3,The worst in the Terminator series,"This one is without a doubt the worst Terminator movie in the series. I didn't hate it, but it was only fun to watch the first time around. It's definitely the most violent, so if you're a total blood and gore fanatic you'll probably enjoy it more than I did. I love that kind of stuff, but it didn't seem to make me like it any better."
2,Blue - Shmoo,"A third-rate third-in-a-series movie does not do any better in blu-ray than it does on VHS or Betamax. There is no noticeable improvement in special effects, much less an improvement in the poor scripting, shoddy direction and editing, and plodding actors. If you were thrilled by the originality of T1 and the action and special effects of T2, best to pretend that T3 was never made - but if watch it you must, save your bucks and rent it from Netflix, 'cause you'll never watch it again . . . and the extra you'd pay for the Ray would better be spent on a real classic (e.g. Forbidden Planet or Blade Runner) that you'll enjoy watching again."
3,Rise of the Machines Not as Good as One or Two but...,"Just as he promised, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is back to aid his former nemesis, a now-adult John Connor (Nick Stahl). It's been 10 years since John saved Earth from Judgment Day, and he's now living under the radar, using no phones, credit cards or anything Skynet can trace. That is, until he encounters T-X (Kristanna Loken), a robotic assassin whose mission is to finish what T-1000 started. Co-stars Claire Danes.Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick StahlDirector: Jonathan MostowGenre: Sci-Fi & FantasyFormat: WidescreenLanguage: EnglishSubtitles: English"
2,Action packed,If you like action movies you should buy this. Its got alot of fighting and less love involved. This is great for all you teens.
5,Best Arnold movie in years.,"This is definitley the best movie Arnold has done since True Lies in 1994. I liked movies like The 6th Day and Eraser, but this one is much better.John Connor is now in his 20's and he is off the grid i.e. no phone, internet, ot credit cards. Nothing that can be tracked by computer. And becaue of this, the new Terminator is sent back to kill those who would eventually be his top people in the war against the machines. He is eventually found and tracked leading to a bunch of great chase scenes and special effects that are as good or better than T2.The movie gets off to quick start and the action keeps on coming non-stop. A very exciting fast paced movie with a little bit of humor added. The story on a whole is pretty good and the ending helps improve that even better. A must see for all Arnold fans and anyone who likes the Terminator series."
4,Enjoyable - action filled in terminator fashion,Does not disappoint. All the action and adventure expected from a terminator movie
4,Good movie,"I have only seen parts of the first two 'Terminator' movies, so there was some of the history that I missed out on. However, I watched this with a friend who filled me in as the movie progressed.I was 99% sure that I wasn't going to like this movie, but I was surprised. Though it's not on my Top 10 list, it was a good movie.The stunts are spectacular, especially at the beginning of the movie. The ending definitely leaves a lot of room for a ""Terminator 4""."
5,Terminator 3 kicked ass,"I dont know about all the rest of you people who gave terminator 3 bad reviews but I really liked the movie. Ever since they announced the making of T3 summer of 2002 I couldn't wait to see it, then I read some of the scripts they had in mind it sounded like a joke to me. All I can say Terminator 3 is better than the matrix sequals. I'm looking for action in my sci fi movies the only movie that measured up to terminator 3 was the last release of the star trek movie. You gotta have a plot for a movie in the case of T3 the plot kind of sucks a little bit but there was so much action in the movie you forget about the plot. Did I mention Kristina Loken how I wanna F*CK her... Good job Mostow on making T3 a good sequal."
2,Road to Nowhere,"I suppose I should grateful that we have been graced with a final installment, but given the enthusiasm for trilogies of late, is this one wise? I think not. Despite the abundance of extras and goodies this is pointless. I haev been generous in allowing it two stars. It shows that the absence of a good story cannot be patched up with the now all too familiar CGI scenes. Arnie looks and is old and the intensity that Linda Hamilton brought to the earlier two films is gone. But hey if you're a fan enjoy, if not avoid."
2,Even worse than I expected,"I say the original Terminator movie when I was 12 years old, and it shaped my perspective of life and the world. I've never been so afraid and exited since.I've refused to see T3 for a long time, for several reasons.However, this christmas my girlfriend placed the DVD in front of me and asked us to watch it.And I did yesterday.To my surprise it was even worse than I expected.Please don't support the stockholders attempt to ruin the Terminator-universe."
2,"An OK movie, but nothing like the previous 2.","OK this is the 3rd instalment by a new director who says on the DVD special feature disc that he wanted to emulate the excitement of the previous 2 films. Trouble is this film doesn't come anywhere near the genius of the first 2. The special effects are good; especially the car chase, but you can't build a film like this solely on effects and ignore the dialogue. I thought this was an OK movie, but that's all. It just always had something missing for me and I believe it would have been better if somebody else with a little more imagination had written it."
2,"Weaksauce, no james cameron, no good movie.","T3 was disapointing for me, it didnt have that same flavor from T1 and T2, sort of cheesy feeling. Cheapy flavor. its likes coca cola, and other sodas tryin to imitate such as pepsi. it doesnt have the same ingredients. not a good movie."
1,garbage,"I hate this movie so much it doesnt deserve one star. I loved the first and second film but this is just pure garbage. I hate this film but then again it has the governator. Garbage garbage garbage, dont even see it. worst film ever"
1,"I can ony say ""amen""","There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said before about this maggot-infested pile of dung parading as a movie. As has been said before, it totally undid and contradicted the first two films. The story line was pathetic, the ""twist"" ending a joke, and Arnold looked more like a well-preserved senior citizen than a killer robot. Add in the tacky, lame attempts at humor like the sunglasses scene outside the bar, and you have a worthless film that should never have been made. Have I made it clear that I hated it?"
2,This is a 1080i transfer NOT 1080p,There is an encoding error made by Warners on this version of T3 as it has been encoded in 1080i not 1080p as per the box description and the HD DVD version.Warners may do an exchange later but at this stage this is the version to be released and there will be no recall....It might be better to wait for the fixed version if Warners do one.The film was a major suck anyway compared to the first 2.
2,Give me a BREAK!,"Whoever rated this more than 3 stars should really take some movie/art appreciation classes or at least watch the first two. For anyone who watched the first two you know that they were just trying to make a fast buck here. With the wildly successful Matix/Lord francises, the Terminator guys tried to slide this one in and it flopped. Production was alright, but the story was just .... .... sorry I fell asleep trying to remember it. Anyway I have to admit I did enjoy it when watched it....that's because I was on a 15 hour flight and watched it for free on a 4 inch tv. I recommend that scenario to anyone who wants to enjoy this movie."
1,DVD was messed up,"I wish I could provide a review of the movie, but the DVD was messed up and it couldn't be viewed. It would play a little then freeze up, play a little then freeze up. Over and over again. I bought the DVD as a gift for my nephew for Christmas. I bought it in November. It's too late to return the item because considering the time it took for him to open it (on Christmas), to watch it, to find out it was messed up, and to tell me about it, the return time alloted had passed. I couldn't return it anyway because it was open. I guess Amazon doesn't guarantee that their movies actually work. That stinks because he was really looking foward to watching it. It's all he asked me to buy him. I just ordered another one from somewhere else to replace it."
4,Follow up on T2,"It's a good follow up on T2 considering it's missing the major actors, Arnold and Linda Hamilton. They could have had other Terminators other than old video of Arnold animated in fight scenes. While the special effects aren't impressive to wipe out the story they hold their own. Some special effects seem very early Transformer like."
2,"Skip T3, go and see Sarah Connor Chronicles on FOX or download it on itunes!!!","I highly recommend the ""Sarah Connor Chronicles"" on FOX as a BETTER alternative to T3 the film! It faithfully continues the storyline begun in T1 and T2. It shows Sarah Connor (now played by 300's Lena Headey) as a woman on a mission to save humanity from Skynet at all costs! With his now older son John (now played by Thomas Dekker) and a Female Terminator (played by Summer Glau of ""Firefly,"") they must fight evil Terminators sent to destroy them all. Please support this action packed TV Series!!! Mondays at 9 pm (EST) on FOX! (Also available on itunes at $[...] per episode!) The series' site is http://www.fox.com/terminator !Mark McLaughlin / marknetproductions.wordpress.com / Hudson, MA, USA"
4,"Not as good as T2, but still a great flick!","I was seriously expecting this to [not be good]. No Sarah Conner, no James Cameron, no Brad Fidel (Composer). Well, the score wasn't the best, but the flick itself continues the story of the Terminator Saga. Yeah, comedy has it's own place, but the action in T3 is great. The TX? She's brutal. Whenever she appears you wonder what type of bone-crunching she's gonna pull next. T3 isn't perfect, but it sure is a worthy flick for the money. I saw it last night, and I'd be willing to see it again!"
4,this movie is awesome,"I just saw Terminator 3 last night. Like most others, I din't have the highest hopes for this movie. I saw it anyway, and all I said after the movie ended was, ""wow"". This movie is great in every way. In fact, it is nearly as good as T2. Definately see this movie. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is it's kind of short. Spanning only 100-110 minutes, this movie just seems like it could had been longer. Otherwise, this movie is great, and I cannot imagine the terminator series without it."
3,"A film i've looked forward to, but...","- Couldnt expect much, but the movie was a fun ride. Unlike the previous entries in the serie, Terminator 3 entertains us with its witty humor and none stop action sequences. I liked the movie, i liked it a lot. But, i did not love it! JUDGEMENT DAY is still the no.1 Terminator film to me, but Terminator 3 proves that a movie doesnt need a VERY rich plot to entertain audiances. Course, movies need plot, but this movie managed to entertain the entire theater i was in. However, if you are looking for a movie with a more depth and a plot, then look elsewhere, T3 is a one and a half hour fun ride with action, special effects, guns & glory, chases and explosions. And all in good humor. O'course i know people would dissagree with my rank for this movie, but since it wasent as good as it could have been, i have to recomment people to rent the movie before buying."
2,disappointed,"another animated movie,arnold has not a big hero character herejust a slave to protect a stuped boy, based on terminator 2 ,no great idea has been created in this movie,arnold play the weak character here (not as always),dont waste your money on this movie."
2,Just not the same without James Cameron at the helm,"I loved the Terminator series growing up, so imagine my disappointment at this movie. Yes, it has all the action one could want, but the problem is it's all action and hardly any story. The one change I did like was the casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor. He was a definite improvement over whiny Eddie Furlong. I miss Linda Hamilton and miss the actual emphasis on the action furthering the story. This movie is just about action furthering the studio's pocketbook."
5,Best Terminator Movie,Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines Is By Far The Best Terminator Movie Ever I Like Arnold's Role As T-850 The Action Was Intense And Kristanna Loken(T-X) Was HOT Though Endoskeleton Scenes Will Scare Younger Kids And The Cats
2,"OK action film, but does not belong with the first 2.",Way too many cute references to the T1 and T2. It's very obvious that the original writer / director had nothing to do with this film. Lacks the mood and the tight plotting. Plus Ahnold is way too old for the part. Cyborgs do not age! The ending is much darker and totally contradicts the main point of T2.
3,It was ok,"Ok, listen up. The best part about this movie was you get to see Kristina Loken...the movie was alright."
3,T2 is the vastly superior picture.,"Let's face it, if you have true fanboy dedication, you're going to buy ""Rise Of The Machines"" even though you know deep in your heart that ""Judgement Day"" surpasses the lastest installment in the Terminator trilogy by leaps and bounds. I think all of us can agree on two points...1. The Terminator was never meant to be cute and funny, so why make him that way now?2. The T-1000 was a far more dangerous threat than the new female Terminator.To say that T3 is a better film than T2 is an insult, but that doesn't mean it's not worthy of your hard earned cash. I'm excited for this movie, and I can't wait for it's release."
3,Not as good as the first two.,"I love Terminator 1 & 2, both of them were excellent(***** star quality!), But Terminator 3 seemed almost it was a rip off money making scheme istead of a truly incredible experience like what the others did. Sure it has flashy special effects and yes ARNOLD is the only terminator ,but its not satisfying. The story is really weak, and the casting of the other characters isn't as good(uhh John Connor!)and where's Sarah Connor? Tell me why is there a girl cyborg(aka Terminatrix)? Too many questions left unanswered.You decide if Terminator 3 is good enough, its disposable ,but maybe cheap thrills is your kind of entertainment. Stick with the first two."
4,A worthy sequel!!!,"This movie is action packed and has good humor. It stands up as one of the best sequels. Short and sweet, you won't die of old age watching it in the theater. See the next Governor of California at his best! Go Arnold!"
4,awsom!!,This movie is WOE!! Meaning very gooooooood!! I thnk ppl should rent or buy this because its worth every dime
5,Great Movie,"A great movie, great action, Great actors. I recommend this movie to anyone that like/loves the terminator series on tv or the movie."
2,Hmmm...I'm not so sure...,"I don't know about this. No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. Essentially the same plot as T2. Besides, since all the terminator parts were destroyed at the end of T2, how was Skynet invented? I suspect we're in for some incomprehensible time-travel mumbo-jumbo, an Arnold terminator that cries, and some female cyborg breast shots. Will they shoot bullets, a la Austin Powers fem-bots?"
1,The Good the Bad and the Worst,"The original Terminator was great a true classic, everything you could ask for in a movie. T2 was boring, way too long a rehash of the original with better special effects minus the violence. T3 is the worst movie of all time along side 28 Days Later, this is a rehash of T2 which was a rehash of T1. T2 the violence was watered down T3 is a joke (I've seen more action packed violent episodes of Scooby Doo). Who are these teens writing great reviews for a poor movie, they weren't even a itch in the papa's Trousers when the original was released. Give this one miss boyz because it's definitely for the Girls."
1,What a joke.,"When I went to the theatre to walk this movie, I went in expecting it now to be near the quality of T2. And that is exactly what it was, a complete joke. The movie was poor acting, poor diolugue, and had a very poor story line. Sure it had some good special effects, but thats where it stopped. How the hell could the terminator remember all the small details that he did from T2? and those stupid one liners were so over done. I hate the way that they killed sara conner, and the actor of john was a complete joke.I really missed the monologues of Sara Conner like in T2, and how T2 had messages about how human were destinted to kill themselves, and about family. And did this movie have even the slightest of this no. All this movie had was 1 hot women.Please just buy the T2 Extreme Edition or something worth your money."
1,terminator 3,"I thought this was the worst terminator movie ever made!!!!I don't know where to start but it really sucks.The terminator chick was not a good terminator she looked too pretty to be one and john connor did not look like that it was so messed up how they did this movie!!!!!!James Camron should be ashamed of himself to ever have put this out, arnold looks too old by the way even though I like arnolds stuff I have to say this is as bad as JUNIOR!!!!!Oh yeah one more thing I don't even give this one star, 0 stars!!!! and If you see this trash please burn it to the ground!Man I can't belive T3 was a so bad I am glad I didn't spend money to see it I saw it at on Cable and I wanted to break my television I hate this movie!!!!!!!"
1,Terminator Sucks,"I hated all three of these movies, they are all so stupid. Please have one machine kill not three different ones. This movie should not even be here they ended it in the second movie don't bring up bullcrap that they didn't stop it be cuz they did. Arnold acting in here was really bad and so was the entire crew. John connor was the biggest wimp of all time. No wait he's the second the ifrst is mark patton's chracter from NOES 2. You want real Arnold movies get Predator that is way better then this garbage."
5,you morons,"Who said T3 was a sequel to T2? T3 is a prequel showing us what happened before Terminator and Judgement Day. We will see John Connor in action as a man, the whole reason Terminator and Judgement Day happen. Plus....this is a science fiction film..how was John Connor born if his father was someone from the future? Fans need to give a little to get a lot!! Arnold's still huge and with the special effects this should be as good as the Matrix sequels"
5,Very Entertaining!,"Being a big fan of the second film, I must say that I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this film even more. Sure, there are people that complain that the story is not as good as the first two movies. But if you like non stop action and big special effects, you won't be disappointed. Definitely no boring moments."
4,SURPRISE! IT'S GOOD,"Despite the lack of Linda Hamilton and James Cameron, this Terminator does more than a respectable job at continuing the franchise with wit, action and imagination. For all of us Terminator fans, this could have been a disaster. The action sequences are absolutely astounding, and the new Terminatrix is vicious and terrifying. Nick Stahl is a vast improvement over Edward Furlong in the last film, and Arnold's presence is actually fun. It's a big popcorn epic, not too long, and actually thought-provoking -- which is a requirement of all Terminator movies!"
4,Waay better than I was expecting.,"All I can say is ""good job."" I was amazed by how good the script actually turned out. Excellent action sequences with an oddly huge sense of humor. Some of my friends didnt like how light-hearted (heh, and I use that term cautiously) the film seems to be, as it never really has any dark, brooding moments of introspection like T2. Its just a really fun action romp that was done in such a way that keeps it from crossing over to the ""cheesy"" side. I'm a huge fan of the original films, and even though this is not James Cameron's Terminator, this is still one of the best films of the summer. Hehe, definitely better than Hulk *gag*."
3,Good but plot..,The plot could've been better. Special effects are GOLD! The film was made to springboard the NEXT generation. There'll b no more Arnold.
4,Comparing The DVD To The Previous VHS Release,"This is a review of this product:G.L.O.W. Vol. 3 - Fans Beware DVD. Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply. After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assurred that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------This DVD was previously releasedon VHS in 1986. Nothing has been edited out. Everything from the original videotape release is include here. By the way, all three GLOW DVDs contain the same slideshow and promo bonus features."
3,More of the night HE came home. The nightmare continues!,"This novelization of the mediocre sequel to one of the most successful independent horror movies of all time is a mixed bag. It is filled with spooky, late night atmosphere and tries hard to build tension and suspense from the filmsy story delivered by screenwriters John Carpenter and Debra Hill. On some levels it does succeed where the movie failed in sustaining suspense and atmosphere, but the lack of a strong story to anchor the events renders the chills meaningless. Jack Martin is a pseudonym for Dennis Etchison, who wrote the excellent novelization of Carpenter's ghost story classic The Fog."
2,"""Halloween II"" novel doesn't do the movie justice","The novelization of ""Halloween II"" follows the storyline of the movie; Michael Myers walks away after being shot six times by his doctor and follows intended victim Laurie Strode to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, where several bodies later cat and mouse meet again. The novel has some minor additions as well as ""scenes"" that were dropped from the final cut of the movie, as well as several pictures from the movie, but the book is a pretty tedious read. Get the Universal DVD if you're in the mood."
1,Slightly disappointed,This was purchased to go along with the Pfaltzgraff Delicious dinnerware but when it was received it did not have the pattern on the bottom of the dispenser as it shows in the picture. It is simply a rose glass sugar dispenser.Also the metal top seems a little flimsy.Disappointed when I received it and cancelled the salt and pepper shakers that matched right away since I did not want the same thing to happen and not have the pattern. I will stick with the stoneware from Pfaltzgraff.
5,Nice method for improving your vocabulary,"I ordered this book to improve my vocabulary for the SATs. It tells you that you will learn a word a minute, and it is true. What it does is it links the word with another easier word so that you can remember the meaning easily. Then, it shows you a little cartoon. Would work perfectly especially if you are studying for an exam like the SATs."
3,Not Quite Enough,At first I thought this book would help me increase my score of 650. But I soon found the book lacking in more difficult words. Words such as gainsay and mundane are words that I seem to use in my so-called coloquial language.I only recommend this book to those who want to reinforce their vocabulary or have trouble recalling things under pressure.
4,Good for Memory.,"I just started working through this book. It does certainly help with words I previously could never remember. However many of the words are only lvl 1 or 2. Id say I skip over about 3/4 of the cartoons.I was *really* hoping the book included more level 4-5 words and less ""fluff"". It has helped me come up with my own visuals for other words not in the book.If you need sat vocab help, try it. Also try Direct Hits volumes."
5,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Book on Every Level,Most reviewers mention 2-3 years olds loving this book. I first came across this book when I was home schooling my first grade granddaughter. We also checked it out of the library more than once. (She now attends public school and is in the third grade.) My memory of the book was so fond I felt I had to own a copy for myself. I know she will be surprised and delighted to see it again and I look forward to reading it to my great grandchildren.
1,Are all White Atheist racist?,"Not necessarily; but, I know from personal experience that their is' a little bit of Adolf Hitler in every white person no matter how much he smiles in your face and shakes your hand! Nevertheless, there is a' 2nd group of White Atheist who are not necessarily racist (i.e. Atheist Experience, Freedom From Religion Foundation, American Atheist, e.t.c.) and they represent a milder form of White Atheism; but, the problem I see with their movements is that they are too open and easily accessible to enemies and/or infiltrators. Go study the American Atheist organization Madalyn Murray O'Hair founded in the 1960's CIA agents heavily infiltrated the' organization because their was no structure and/or limitations. With all the idiotic liberal so-called progressive ideas running rampant within the Atheist community we're all doomed to failure."
5,The Second Greatest Book in the history of the world,"As the man who today stands in the footsteps of the author, as leader of The World Church of the Creator, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Along with Nature's Eternal Religion, our first book, The White Man's Bible reveals the threat to the continued existence of our people, and what we can do to end this threat..."
5,Outstanding!,"This book is, next to Klassen's previous book, Nature's Eternal Religion, the best book ever written. I highly recommend it."
4,Good Christmas movie,"Family friendly. If you are a dog lover, you will enjoy this family oriented movie. Is a keeper. Will be watching every year!"
3,Chasteté bien ordonnée,"Une version re-vampée de la mère-au(x)-chat(s), genre jeune fille sans uniforme, en page couverture, donne le ton de cet ouvrage où les poster girls de la chasteté se succèdent, réjouissantes ou pathétiques, souvent les deux.Malgré la méthodologie studieuse de la thèse, aux assises hautement documentées, c'est l'esprit du story-telling qui domine ici avec son charme bon enfant, ses procédés dramatiques, ses coups de cur. Pourtant, certains chapitres au contenu fragmenté ou répétitif sont de trop tandis que le nouveau célibat est compacté en un dernier chapitre plutt prcheur et... démoralisant. Mais peut-tre n'est-ce que l'ombre suspecte que projettent, sur l'ensemble du livre, ces confidences de l'auteur vantant candidement les avantages tangibles de sa récente chasteté, après s'tre sortie des ruines d'un mariage raté et avoir reconquis son christianisme?Pour un résumé complet du livre, visitez www.essai21.com"
2,not so good,"I remember having this book read to me as a kid, our aging old granny of a teacher who was a dedicated feminist read it to us not once but twice during a single month. I must say as a male the ending I thought was offensive and uncalled for, and I remember being quite shoced with it at the time. What did the woodcutter do to deserve his punishment exactly? being handsome and mucular? being poor? trying to woo the princess and not fight her? he is sincere and kind and she just kicks the poor guys ass."
4,pretty good for girls,"A hardcover childrens picture book, this is like a kind of alternative fairytale, where the princess is rough and tough. Probably best at girls 7-10. Its well written and the pictures are great.Pretty good book, my 7year old daughter liked it alot."
2,Bad sound quality and a lot of coughing,"The programme is interesting and rich. The conductor, Stokowski, was among the best in his time and will, probably, remain among the very best of all times.Therefore, this DVD has historical value. However, for those wanting to watch and listen to a nice DVD classical program there are many problems. The quality of the sound is not good and there is a lot of annoying, irritating coughing, besides other unwelcome sounds."
5,Quality paperbound / URL,"I'm a retired printer. This is the perfect companion to my hardback edition of Magna Carta Ancestry. It is in one way superior, this multi-volume edition is lighter to lug around.The typography is superb. I prefer the lighter weight for utility of use. The cover and binding look to be of superior quality. It resembles the PoD public-domain books I've had re-published. Some pages of text to not align square to the sheet. I regard this as minor.The URLs linked and I will return. Very High Quality."
1,This wire stinks!,This wire stinks! I bought it to save money over the Home Depot product. Boy am I sorry. The welds are totally inferior. The outboard welds are about 50%. This is an example of you get what you pay for. I tried to save a few bucks and it bit me. Cheap really is expensive. Will not buy again.
2,poor,"Package arrived no box, no bubble wrap, smashed ends in fair condiction and a piece of plastic that was covering the roll of mesh."
5,Hit Home!,"Everything we needed to hear in a well done movie. Acting was good. Story line very, very prevalent to today's world. LOVED IT!!"
2,kinda boring,this movie is about an author that goes into the future. my brother got the DVD version from a pawn shop and we were wondering what it was like. the point of the story is good but he complains about every thing and says that it is sinful. for an example this boy watches T.V. and sees two kids kissing and stands in the kids way just so the kid will not see them kiss and it was the kids home. 1 thing i do not get is he says you should not do this should not do that yet he lied at the end. you watch this then you will see what i mean.
3,Simply but powerful,This was obviously a low-budget film but it delivers a powerful punch! The message of the film wasn't clouded over or shrouded behind double-talk. It makes the viewer think a lot about issues that Christian's and non-believers alike should be very concerned with. It would be a great film for youth groups to watch to stir conversation.
3,wait a minute...,"i thought Time Changer was a pretty good movie with an interesting plot... not as dynamic as the Omega Code or other TBN productions, but it was okay. Yeah some of the acting was pretty cheesy, but i still liked the movie.the only thing that kept me wondering about this movie was Dr. Carlisle's last scene in the modern world. he avoided being taken back to the police station with the two men by saying that Jesus was coming soon (that wasn't a direct lie because in the movie he IS coming soon). then when the portal or whatever opens to take him back to 1890, he says that jesus HAS come and he's taking him...leaving the two men to believe that they had been left behind. Wouldn't he be sinning by lying to the men, even if he did have a good reason?i don't know. but i think this is a quality Christian family movie and is definitely worth watching."
4,Time Changer (The Movie) DVD,"This movie has a unique story line to show what would happen if good morals were taught apart from the name and authority of Jesus. The movie itself is not that exciting, but the theme is fascinating."
4,Timeless message,"Do rules have any meaning if there is no recognized authority behind the rules? That is the crux of this movie. If you try to have people follows God's rules and morals without teaching about God and why He has the right and authority to make these rules, you will be left with rebellion."
1,Oh My God!!!,"Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, except that it was so bad I couldn't look away -- like a train wreck."
2,A simple movie with a simple message.,"You question the bible and you are evil!! Christianity must be forced on everyone, if they like it or not. Free will is a tool of Satan!! This is basically what the message of this movie was. One line in this propaganda film was, ""The scripture is always true, and never needs verification."" I will say that D. David Morin was very good in this. His character was likable, if not a bit close minded."
5,Great Christian movie!,"It was pretty cool. First we rented this movie and liked it so much we bought it. The seller is Rich Christiano. He is actually the producer and director of the movie. He offered to sign the copy if we wanted. The movie came very quickly and we have already viewed it several times. Thanks, Rich for producing such a powerful family Christian film."
5,It's mind changing,This movie will astonish you. John Hagee was right Im glad we got this movie it will make you realize how we have been leaving out most of the time; acknowledgment of the word of God.Its an eye opener and it will stir your hearts and your loved ones.An awesome family movie.
1,Not a Sci-Fi / Worst Movie Ever / Propaganda Piece / WARNING!,"This is not a Sci-Fi movie. This is a religious propaganda film. Buyer beware! This is the worst movie ever. I couldn't even finish it and I have watched some pretty painful, awful movies. This movie is screened at churches and they are all told to go review the movie on Amazon and other sites so there are a lot of ""shill"" reviews out there. These people think that they are doing Gods will and can trick you into watching an awful movie and somehow you will become enlightened and change your mind about the whole Jesus thing. One of my favorite all time movies is ""The Ten Commandments"" this is a very religious movie, well done with great acting. This movie ""Time Changer"" is a horror show of what the christian taliban would do to this country if they could. Don't waste your time or money and please click on the button saying this review was helpful to you."
2,It's A Sermon Not A Movie,"I didn't enjoy the movie. Jennifer O'neil's character has no relationship with the script. After twice meeting people from the past, each of whom have no idea how recent history transpired, Michelle launches into (presumably the same) sermon about the moral decline of the times. Her role is overly preachy, and unrealistically steps over Carlisle's complete ignorance of the events she describes.I wanted to see the movie because of its concept. I don't think it was well done, in spite of the cast of great actors. It came off as something I could expect to see watching a late-night TV evangelist."
1,This movie should be in the religion section!!,"This movie should be in the religion section, not the sci-fi section! The movie was produced by people who make movies that are played in churches to christian audiences. The acting is simplistic and primitive. I also am repulsed at the theme of the movie, which is that good deeds have no value, unless they are performed by someone who believes in Jesus. I am not exaggerating- that is the message of this movie!! All non christians would be insulted by this theme. I dont believe that christian themed movies should be misrepresented as science fiction."
1,Hideous,"Pass this by. Possibly the worst sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time. This is a total preach fest! Do not watch unless you find grass growing interesting. It gets a bit old when a group of older WHITE men tell me that my morals are wrong because I don't believe excatly what they believe in or do not give credit to Jesus for the source. If you would like a wholly innacurate incredibly dull experience, or possibly have really bad insomnia. Watch (attempt?) this film. ICK!"
1,The packaging neglects to mention that this is propoganda,"Pure blantant Christian propoganda. The acting is terrible, the story fails to argue its' point, and the packaging I would argue is intentionally deceitful, which is extremely ironcic given the Christian moral message of the movie.If you want another crutch to prop up your religious beliefs on, by all means rent this movie. But if you have a brain and can think for yourself, the ridiculousness of this movie will cease being funny about 30 minutes in.For the first 15 minutes I kept expecting the movie to be a joke, a comedy. But it isn't. Its just trite and stupid."
1,Cheesy,"This movie is dull and I would be embarrassed to invite anyone to see it with me, or to recommend it. The visuals were great, but that's about the only thing good I could say about it. This is a thinly-veiled vehicle for the evangelical message, but naive in its presentation,and so would probably get good reviews only from evangelicals. It certainly would not impress the people who need Christ most, if they are accustomed to quality secular works. The lead actor was not likeable, which further makes the transparent preaching motive hard to take. I am a Christian, and regret having to review the film in this way, but I have to be honest."
5,"Good movie, fantastic lesson about truth and right & wrong",The movie moves quickly and keeps your interest. Its good for young and old. It is very Christian (the J word is actually used in its fullness). Blessings to all!
5,Time changer,This is a very thought provoking movie. It would be good for everyone to see at least once.Our entire family liked it. From Grandparents to the youngest grandson all were kept focused and interested. And it led to a great discussion.The quality of the copy you sent was excellent as well.Thank you
3,Could be shorter,"This film has a solid Christian foundation and the message of connecting Christ's words and direction for our lives comes through very well. I believe it could have been communicated more quickly. The early part of the film (the struggle to have it printed) was too long. Also, the various scenes of the professor's visit to the future could have been done more quickly by shortening his experiences in the different scenarios he confronted; i.e., getting to the point more quickly."
3,too hot,"Although American DK recommends the use of this bulb for its DJ16 Lights, we disagree.It is too hot and too dangerous to function for any length of time.What we did was to instal a GU10 edison base adapted and replace the halogen with an 11 watt GU10 LED-Same brightness and lasts 25-35,000 hours unattended-no heat- we also popped 4 holes is the body of the DJ16 to insure air flow."
2,Updated: burned out after only 4-6 weeks,"I had originally given this bulb a 5-star review based on it being a great value and working seemingly fine. However the bulb burned out yesterday (I was using it in my GE range hood) after being in there only about 4-6 weeks, so the quality seems to be subpar."
2,Damagaed shipment,"I order two bulbs with this order, they came poorly packed, just a bit of bubble wrap in the box but the packages of the bulbs were loose in the box. One was broken."
3,Just for Today: Review,I was disappointed because I thought it was the original addition of the book and not the new addition. It was a gift so I sent it anyway but it wasn't what I really wanted.
1,Book has been written in/ Just For Today,It was not mentioned that this book was written in... It had no value for the purpose I bought it for. (a gift). I was VERY disappointed and donated the book to an area group. Maybe you should think about doing that next time.
3,"12 ply, but the plies must be really thin","These pads are as advertised, but I expected them to be a bit thicker, with more bulk. They seem to be really thin. I use these to apply a liquid medication to my dog's chest, and the medication readily soaks thru the pad, applying the meds equally to the dog and to my fingers.The good part: They're inexpensive, and I've got a bunch of 'em now.The bad part: Thin, see above.Conclusion: Consider my review and make your buying decision accordingly! LOL"
5,my son's favorite movie,"My son always says, ""Nemo"" he's one and a half years old. As soon as i play this movie he's glued to the t.v. and has also learned to say fishy from Darla. Great movie, great animation, great everything for kids."
4,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!,I bought this movie only because Pixar made it. I did not care for the Nemo's father in this movie. He was just a worry wart who talks to much. Reminds me of woody allen. It is a tremendously awesome movie for kids of all ages. Very very funny scenes that you will seem to laugh at over & over again. I still think Pixars best movie's are Toy Story 1&2.
2,not like it said it was,"I bought this and it said ""like new"". When i recieved it the case was broken. the outside of the case had holes in it and busted and the inside of the case would not hold the disk and it was just sliding around inside it. The disk was scratched and had to have it buffed to work. Not satisfyed with discription of product."
2,Poor sound.,"I ordered this film to show in my class. It was disappointing. The sound was so low we couldn't hear the dialogue. At first, I thought it was my equipment. I then tried another film on DVD, and the sound was fine with that. I don't know if something went wrong with the streaming, but it was quite a let down."
3,Finding Nemo,I was very dissapointed when I received the DVD to find I couldn't play it on my DVD player. I had never heard of different Regions. I know that you advertised it that way but it didn't mean anything to me. What an expensive mistake since our DVD player could not be reconfigured to this Region. I was pleased to find that I could play it on my PC so not all was lost. But watching on a small monitor is just not the same as watching it on the TV. The movie is great and I have learned a lesson which I have passed on to other people.
2,"Visually stunning, same old story arc","Child loses parent figure and spends the rest of the movie searching for him. Sound familiar?Not to mention, this is a scary movie for young kids, starting with Nemo's mother (and all of his siblings) being killed.On the plus side, there are lots of extras in the DVD.If you want a classic Pixar for the whole family, try Toy Story 2 or Monsters, Inc."
4,Very good edition,"One of the best Pixar's movies and full of contents. Maybe the 3D edition is not as good as other movies, but It's enough for me"
5,Finding Nemo is a great film for people of all ages,"Finding Nemo is a great film for children adults and just about everybody. It start when Marlin (Nemos father) is left alone after his wife and children are all taken by a sea creature all except 1 nemo. Nemo grows up and is going to school for the first day Nemo is taken on a little excursion and Marlin comes after him saying he's worried about nemo and he can't go to school Nemo goes out to a boat and is captured by a man snorkling Marlin then sets out to find Nemo and we follow is adventure along the way and get introduced to new characters such as Dory Marlins new friend, Bruce and a range of sea creatures from nemos aquarium. It is a good film with lots of laughs and is worth while seeing."
5,Not only is this movie great......,"....but it's a sure fire way to keep the Whosits entertained when you start tossing quotes at one another. ""Gonna go see a man about a wallabee"" Not again........."
4,"Same story, different characters","This movie begins with a tragedy (like Bambi and The Lion King).It also includes physical deformity (like Dumbo with his big ears). You would think that they could come up with a storyline that didn't include whiping out the entire family.Once I ""got over it"" I enjoyed the rest of the movie. The animation was wonderful."
5,waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy cooooooolllllllllll !!!,"I am writing this review on behalf of my 5 yr old son.His words were as exactly as my title,"" Waaaaaaayyyyyy Coooooollllllll""He saw it twice, whereas I only saw it the one time.Spending it with him was one of the greatest days a father and son can have.All I can hope is for Disney Pixar To keep Movies like ""Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., etc"" on coming."
5,I LOVED THE CUTE LITTLE FISHY!,"I THOUGHT THE MOVIE, WAS THE CUTEST DISNEY MOVIE I EVER SEEN!ELLEN WAS SO FUNNY!NEMO WAS THE CUTEST!I AM AN ADULT AND, I LOVED THIS MOVIE!5 STARS***** WAY TO GO DISNEY!"
4,Righteous Totally,This was a great movie. The animation is totally off the charts. Others could learn from Pixar animation. Also the two-disc DVD is fun for kids and adults alike. I loved Marlin and Dory. Kudos to Albert Brooks and Ellen Degeneres.
5,Superb! Fun for the whole family!,What a cute film! The DVD has loads of extras and I could choose between wide-screen or full-screen (I watched it full-screen!) I even played the game on it and watched all the extras. hahahahaha I'm a sucker for a Disney film....An excellent Christmas present. Some may consider it the least impressive of the pixar films but it's still worth watching.
4,Fish With Feelings,"I would give this movie 5 stars because the animation was awesome, but I have learned to expect nothing but the best from Pixar. Instead, I gave it 4 stars because the storyline, although interesting, was just missing something. I didn't like this nearly as much as Monsters, Inc. Ellen Degeneres as Dori the fish, was perfect. There is also a jelly fish scene, where I learned something about them I never knew before.Admittedly, I probably would have liked this more too if it hadn't had the typical Disney opening trauma of having something/someone die, and then building a story/moral around that."
5,Do sea it!,It is a very entertaining movie and a lot better than toy story or Monster.inc. The character creations are great. My favourite character is the forgetful fish(whose name I have forgotten)The graphics are excellent and the story being one of the best is the main reason why I give it 5 stars.
3,"One time HD, rest is average","The movie is great, one of the all time great movie, I was concerned about the product. The first time I played this product, the quality was great. After that the video does not match that of HD."
5,Great movie,this was a great movie for adults and kids. It was great to rent on amazon prime and stream right to our tv at home via our sony blue ray player.
5,Still a Great Movie,"I purchased this to support a unit on the ocean with children with disabilities. They love it, it's well done-What's better?"
1,oh boy,I really didn't enjoy this movie. This movie is only for young kids. I found it boring and so make believish. If you want to watch a film the whole family can enjoy watch Pirates of the Caribbean.
1,"good film, lousy DVD","The film itself is a wonderful, entertaining family film. However the quality of the DVD that the film is on is very poor.We were able to get to the MENU only once -the very first time we played the DVD. We went to the extras to look at the ""virtual aquarium"" but we found the screen almost completely obscured. Then we went to film itself and found that once the film starts playing, there is no way to pause, fast-forward,rewind, etc. In fact it is impossible to get to the Menu until the film has finished."
1,Not a bad effort,"Nemo has its moments. Vegetarian sharks? Wonderful idea! A dentist that inflicts mahem on his patients? Ah my childhood nightmares take flight again! The world's dummest fish as a companion? Hilarious!Yes this film has its moments and the animation is quite first class.But if you want to see how a cartoon made for kids can appeal to adults, try ""Ice Age"". For me the humor in ""Ice Age"" was far more sophisticated and endearing to adults.Nemo wins out for animation but for a compact, well told story without a minute of waste, it just doesn't compare to ""Ice Age"". Overall I rate Nemo as a young kid's movie that parents can chuckle over. Much better than Monsters Inc which was really just a one-joke flick."
2,not for three year olds,"i don't know why Disney movies seem to need to kill off the mother - it's as if kids can't dream of a big life if their mom's around... but it starts with Nemo's mom being eaten, then Nemo's in danger, my 3 year old couldn't take it - she's a kid with anxiety though so, maybe a normal kid who watches a lot of bright loud t.v. would have no problem...Heck just turn of the t.v. and give the kid a book! That's what I really meant to say."
3,Mostly Harmless,"...unless you highly value your leisure time. The visuals are outstanding, and left me in awe of the creative team behind this movie. The story, however, was formulaic, and the voice talent unimpressive; after several hours of their neurotic, frantic, earnest bumbling, I would be content to never hear the voices of Ellen DeGeneres or Albert Brooks again.The story concerns an overprotective father clownfish who braves the terrors of the hitherto (by him) unexplored ocean in search of his captured son, Nemo. In the meantime Nemo, in his dentist-office fish tank,struggles to make his own way out before he is given as a gift to the dentist's fish-killing niece. I found the pacing slow, and every running gag is beaten over the head until it whimpers. The kids liked it, though, so viewing the movie made for a harmless, although for me, tedious, excursion."
2,THIS MOVIE WAS BORING,I am really suprised this movie was so successful. I thought it was boring a tedious. I thought the fish Ellen voiced was annoying with her constant memory lose. I think only kids will like this unlike Shrek which I loved....
2,"Boring, Annoying but great visuals",this movie is something that if it was silent it would be a work of computer generated art. But the words just mess it up dory is one of the most annoying characters ever created. Albert Brooks does an okay job as the worrying overprotective father and I like the turtles but otherwise this movie is for the 8 and under set(even though my friends like it they think its adorable) this movie if immedialatley after you see a puppy dog in a toliet paper commercial you go AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!
2,Disappointing,"I took 4 kids who are five- to six-year olds to this movie today (opening day.) You've probably already read about the baracuda eating Nemo's mom and all his siblings in the first 15 minutes of the movie. I can't say that was as disturbing to the kids as it was to me - they were all confused as to what was going on and didn't get it. However, there is one shock after another in this film. From the sharks to the dentist performing root canal work, to the sadistic little girl that Nemo is to be given to, none of the kids in my group liked the film.I think Disney tried to hard to make an action-packed film and forgot that there can be action without the fear factor (think Toy Story 2)The two stars I gave it are for the graphics -- superior as usual, and Ellen DeGeneres' portrayl of Dorrie, the forgetful fish who helps Nemo's dad find him."
5,Perfect Movie!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is auesome!!!It's about A fish named Nemo,one day he gets captured by these divers so his father,Marlin,trys to swim after the boat that Nemo is in.But he's too late,Then he runs into another fish named Dory.(she has short term memory loss.)So Marlin and Dory go searching the WHOLE entire sea looking for Nemo,along the way they make some friends.Like the radical dude Crush the turtle.The not-so-radical Bruce the shark who goes nuts and trys to eat them.While Nemo is in a Dentist's office somewhere in Sydney,Austrailia.he meets the tank gang,Gurgle,Bloat,Gill,Peach,Bubbles,Deb,and Jaques(i don't know if theres more or not,i don't think so.)anyway you should definitly buy this on DVD it is auesome!!!The first DVD is useless because it just shows wide screen and the features suck,but the second DVD has Full screen edition and way cool extras.sincerly,kenny"
5,I love this movie!,"I'd wanted to see this movie for a long time, but was extremely busy when it was in the theater and couldn't go. I was thrilled when it came out on DVD.The beginning of the movie was a bit of a shock for me, as none of my friends who had seen the movie warned me. (But it's okay...the movie has a happy ending! :c) )Nemo is so cute with his lucky fin and he reminds me of human children who want to push the envelope with their parents. This is a movie the most people are going to enjoy. I could definitely watch it again!"
4,Cute family film.,"Finding Nemo is a sweet and enjoyable family film. This film is almost perfect, the ending drags a bit. Finding Nemo has such a good message and the characters are absolutely delightful, I highly recommend checking out this animated treasure, enjoy!"
4,Finding Meaning in Parenthood,"What an entertaining and moral teaching presented in such a high tech format. As a father, grandfather, and great grandfather I could so identify with the lesson of having to allow my children to find their own way yet being there for them as they ventured out. I even felt I had lost them for a while but eventually I found them again. The movie told my story really and I'm sure many parents felt the same identity. I've always felt movies are some of the greatest theraputic media available and this one certainly has that if the viewer is open to it. Thank you for such opportunities."
4,A Great Animated Family Film,"This animated pixar film has been the best Disney movie in years. Full of humor and sadness a clownfish named Marlin goes looking for his stolen son Nemo. With vegetarion sharks, a deep sea fish that has a glowing light on an attena, and a nightmare named Darla. This is movie is a kid favorite."
5,"Pixar's best, this will be a classic","Finding Nemo is funny and it's and absolutly wonderful children's movie that will touch the hearts of even the coldest of people... wait... that's not me! but that's basically my opinion of Finding Nemo. Get this now, or get your butt kicked later on in the future!"
5,Another Disney Classic!,I bought this DVD before I even saw it. Being a lover of all Disney Animations I knew I wasn't going to be in for a let down & I was not at all!!! This is one of the cutest animations yet I am glad it is an addition to my Disney DVD collection.
3,THANK YOU ELLEN,"This movie is GOOD NOT GREAT as far as children movies go,it does have a few slow moments.It is something that older children may enjoy. BUT THANK YOU Ellen DeGeneres without you this movie would be lacking BIG TIME."
5,"Yes, GREAT MOVIE! Everything in there!","I have never seen that movie in theater until it appear for home. I knew it's worth to keep. Guess what? I am right. It's full of humor and enjoyable watch this movie.Oh yeah, it's worth to keep that movie for home. It have all SUBTITLE available on all special features - very helpful for hearing impaired (deaf). It make great for use on the laptop or portable DVD player for travel. PERFECT!"
5,Great Family Movie,My family and I loved this movie. It is very funny and has beautifully animated ocean scenes. Another great movie from Disney.
5,Finding Nemo,"by Brittany Herndon.Finding Nemo is a comedy,action,and suspense movie that I think is a great kids movie.I think that some funny parts in the movie are Nemo's first day of school. He is really excited! Another funny part is when Marlin, Nemo's dad, meets Dory, and they go and look for Nemo.Some of my favorite action scenes are when Bruce, the shark, is chasing Marlin and Dory around, trying to eat them. Another scene is when Marlin and Dory go through the jellyfish so they can get to the jet stream to get to Nemo. Then there is the part where they meet the sea turtle and he helps them get to where Nemo is.The parts that I think build you up with suspense is when Bruce, the shark, comes up to them and asks them to go to a party, because you don't know if he is going to kill them. Another thing is you that you wonder if Marlin will ever find Nemo.I think that if you have small kids they would really enjoy this movie."
4,My Review,"I think that Finding Nemo is a real hilarous movie. I really enjoyed watching that film. It was sad in a way, because Nemo is the only one that survives out his brothers and sisters. He gets lost and the main point of the movie is that his dad looks for him. when he finnaly finds him after going through alot of scary adventures. In the proces he meets new people like Dori and Bruce. They are the ones that help Nemo's dad find him. I think people from all age ranks can watch this movie. It's a family movie and i'm sure anyone will enjoy it."
4,Finding Nemo - 4.5 / 5,"Another huge success for the folks over at Pixar, Finding Nemo is a delightful film that should be enoyable for everyone. If you've seen other Pixar movies, it won't surprise you to find that the humor can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. Kids will love it, most teens not too worried about being cool will enjoy it, and any adult with children should find it entertaining as well. Another fantastic movie for the entire family."
5,Finding Nemo,"I was very happy with this item. It arrived on time, which was important to me. And of course we love the movie."
5,Amazing 3D Movie for your collection,a must movie to add your 3D movie collection.flawless transition to a 3d Movie.great depth and clarity awaits you in this Gem
5,Great,Husband and I watched it together and enjoyed it immensely. This has always been a favorite of mine but I had it on tape only and needed to get it on disc.
4,Ellen DeGeneres' acting was the best part,"The movie was a little long, but the graphics were terrific. Unfortunately, I'm a little scared of being underwater--so it was somewhat disquieting."
5,Great Movie For All Ages,"I was skeptical upon seeing this, but was surprised to find myself as a 19 year old guy loving it. The animation was great, the cast wonderful, and the story was pretty good. ""Finding Nemo"" revolves around a young fish and his over-protective father. The young fish (Nemo) is caught and ends up in a dentist office aquarium. His father sets off on an adventure across the ocean to find him meeting another fish (Dorie) on the way *fabulously voiced by Ellen Degeneres.* This isn't a movie just for kids. All ages will love it. Highly recommended family entertainment."
5,Its a Great Family Movie,"Another Movie kids saw but in 3 D they were glued to TV not 1 time did it ruin the night, we enjoyed and loved the peace and quiet"
4,Finding Nemo,"Perhaps Pixar's fifth animated romp ""Finding Nemo"" was inevitable to such praise as it got (being the best reviewed movie of 2003) because it surely deserved it! The concept is simple: Marlin, a clown fish (after a tragedy) becomes an overprotective father to his son, Nemo. Nemo gets lost and Marlin must embark on a quest to save Nemo (in the traditional Pixar fashion I might add). Marlin then meets Dory, a very forgetful fish (the comic relief of the film) and they become friends. Meanwhile Nemo is at a fish-tank at a dentists office in Australia, and there with the help of the other fish (a starfish stuck to the wall, a mysterious fish named Gil and other humorous personalities) try to escape to the ocean from a girl with a reputation to ""kill fish"". The visual effects in this movie are the best yet in a(CG)animated movie. ****1/2 stars A- highly reccomended."
2,Why da hell do u parents have to ruin everythin,"THIS MOVIE IS CLEARLY FOR KIDS. WHY DA HELL DO THESE NO LIFE PARENTS ALWAYS HAVE TO COMMENT ON THESE KIDDIE MOVIES! GET A LIFE AND GO WATCH SUM RATED MOVIES! aND PERSONALLY I DON KNO WHY THIS MOVIE WAS SO HYPED UP. IT WASNT DAT FUNNY. THERES KIDS IN SHELTERS DAT CULD USE UR MONEY, DONT WASTE IN ON DIS MOVIE"
2,Didn't need the stereotyping in the initiation scene,"Had problems playing this in DVD and blu ray players that normally don't have problems. After the first 10 minutes the freeze-framing seems to have stopped, and it could play.The story is overall OK, although it's definitely a kid's movie.But I was really surprised that Pixar included a scene that trivializes aboriginal culture (aboriginal in this case pacific islander). There's an 'initiation' scene that is right out of a tacky B&W; comedy. I can only imagine what a child might infer from it, and it diminishes the overall message of the story."
1,Disc Won't Fully Play,"I bought the Finding Nemo DVD set with two DVDs. I bought them for my girls while we travel. Unfortunately BOTH skip, in the van and even in the DVD player at our house. I am not happy because my girls love Nemo and I spend good money for these DVDs. I will NOT buy from this vendor again!"
1,Do Not Purchase,"When I ordered this DVD originally, it did not have all the 'warnings' that it was not compatible with U.S. DVD players. I have been trying to get a refund through Amazon and haven't succeeded yet. My daughter also purchased this exact same DVD and she agreed that it didn't have the remarks about not being compatible with US DVD players. I am still pursueing a refund. Also the shipment took weeks to get to me."
1,Horrible,"This movie just grates on me. The casting was terrible, Ellen's voice makes my head want to explode, the turtle is a completely useless character and this movie is NOT FUNNY! There were a lot of movies made not long ago much better than this one such as Shrek, The Emperor's New Groove and Monster's Inc. Don't waste your money on this bad movie. Rent Shrek instead."
2,One of the fish's name is 'Gill'...,"Okay, naming one of the fish's 'Gill' is so basic, and lazy, and just flat-out pathetic. Hey! Kind of like the movie itself! That's like calling an elephant 'Trunk', or a tiger 'Stripes'... uh oh, I'm giving Pixar more ideas for their NEXT ""masterpiece"". I know what to expect. Some kid being lost and someone trying to save him and get him back to his family. Case in point, Finding Nemo is basically just chase after chase after chase after chase after CHASE! Guess it's tough being a fish. They need to get Nemo back to his dad! Much like the monsters had to get Boo back to her family in Monsters Inc. Much like the Sloth and Mammoth had to get the baby back to it's family in Ice Age (non-Pixar movie). Much like the toys getting back to Andy in Toy Story. Much like... oh well, you get the point. Oh yeah, wasn't Dinosaur about getting someone back to its family too? Heh. Lame and boring."
2,Pixar's Worst! (SAD MOVIE),"Although I've seen and enjoyed every Pixar film so far I have to say Nemo dissapointed me. This is certainly a sad story, a lonely story about loss which I don't find appropiate for kids. I don't remember anyone dying in any of the previous PIXAR movies and they were still great movies, so why putting the idea of death and loss in the children's mind? Children should laugh and enjoy and we adults should try to let them enjoy thier chilhood and protect them from sadness. There'll be plenty of time for that when they grow up. Visually the movie is great and some of the special features are worth watching too but the storyline is far from being funny. Grab yourself any of the TOY STORIES instead."
3,Pretty Good,At first I thought dis wuz going to be one of those stupid highly antisipated Crappy movies. Then my lil' Bro got it and I thought why not lets give it a chance! It was good but not thta great. I loved the turtle scene and some of it wuz cute! Doen't compare to any of the classics though
1,Finding Nemo - movie wouldn't play,we couldn't get the movie to play at all. It wouldn't even get past the Disney symbol. I would like a refund please.
1,My Bad,My BadI didn't know I was buying the Chinese version. This one will not play. I meant to order the English version.
3,It was pretty decent,"I had purchased this one because my 3 year old twins decided to snap the previous one that we had. The packaging was okay shape, definitely no worse than the packaging my old one had already been in. The back side of the DVD was pretty smudgy, when I took it out. Just thought to myself- ""wow, they didnt even attempt to wipe it off first"". I was able to rub all the smudges out and it played perfectly fine. Overall I was pretty satisfied with it. It played long enough to get me through dinner preperation, so hey, you're a-ok with me."
5,Finding Nemo,"I'll keep my review short and in agreement with the large amount of positive reviews already expressed.I would just add: Besides being one of the year's most entertaining movies for youngsters, Finding Nemo astounds grown ups with ""how'd they do that"" art for the total length of the movie. This movie has a sophisticated plot. Lot's of laughs yet poignant. The animation is so good you forget you're watching animation and not living creatures! I also appreciated that both the widescreen and fullscreen versions are included in the one package. The behind the scenes extras show how enthusiastic and professional the creative staff are.This is another DVD that makes your player, TV, etc look their best! And, if not obvious from my review, one that I think should be in everyone's DVD collection!John Row"
5,Excellent,A fantastic movie. Visually stunning... Pixar is raising the bar as usual. The writing is top notch. Excellent voice acting by Ellen D. Looking for racial downturns.... hiss. Lighten up my friend!
4,Great Movie!!!,"I really enjoyed this movie, right from the start. The animation was great and all the bright underwater scenes really put on a great setting. The story is easy to fallow for young children, but some parts are slow and could bore you easily. Some of the ""jokes"" werent that great either. I think they tried too hard to make this movie a comedy and it just turned out flat at some parts. Overall this movie was good though. It has more good qualities than bad, and of course I was overjoyed to get this on DVD."
4,There is a little more here than meets the eye,"The first time I saw this film I was unimpressed. After the ""Killing Bambi's Mother"" opening, the story seemed to meander about to an inevitable conclusion. The key to enjoying this film is not allowing the sad opening to cut-off your emotional connection to Marlon and his son Nemo. If you can sustain empathy with the characters, the story becomes one of profound personal development for a father that has been emotionally crippled by a tragety. Through his trek he learns how to find the heart to take risk and really live a life instead of hide from it. This film may be the darkest piece Pixar has made since ""Toy Story 2,"" but it is worth supporting for the beauty of the work alone."
3,Funny but Scary,"This movie was very scary for young children. I have enjoyed other Disney/Pixar movies, so I made the mistake of buying this one before I watched it. I then saw the movie with children ages 2,4,5,9, and 12. Of all of the children, only the 4 year old and 12 year old liked it. The 5 year old cried for much of the film, and the two year old kept saying, ""Scary.""The animation is fabulous, and there is some cute humor in the movie. I was surprised at how much violence there was in the movie. All Disney movies seem to have some sort of violence, but most also include cute scenes with singing or some kind of happy events. This movie was more of a child ""thriller."" I don't believe it is suitable for children under six, unless the child is not particularly sensitive."
5,Finding Nemo's the bomb!,"Thank you Pixar for the 5th new movie. Finding Nemo rocks. Can't wait till that movie comes on DVD in fact, it's my favorite movie."
5,Best G rated movie..... EVER!,"My little sister got this as a birthday present a few months ago. She watched it once and started to become addicted to it. She watches it almost all the time! (at least when she's not bugging me or watching ""brother bear"" (her other favorite movie) So of course I had to watch it to see what she was so hyper about. Boy.. was I in for a surprise! I thought it was going to be another stupid disney movie, but I was wrong. Finding Nemo is easily in my top ten movie list and my favorite G rated movie! The animation is terrific and the voices for the charectors were very well picked! (Ellen rocked as Dory and Marlin (whoever that guy was) was cool too. Squirt, what can I say about him?! He's adorable! Adorably animated and adorable voice!) Whoever doesn't like this movie is crazy!"
4,A Review Haiku by Todd Marrone,"Real, light-hearted funfor kids and adults alike,the seagulls are great."
4,3D movie,"I love this movie, the only regret is that I had to purchase it in 3D ALSO. I just wanted Blu-ray & digital copy, had to buy the 3D also. Ahhhh ""just keep swimming.keep swimming""....."
2,Was not able to download AND project with iPad as Amazon video download site did not support Apple products,"I wanted to download (and purchase) this children's video to install in my iPad so that I could project with a pico projector during a trip to remote places in South Pacific next month. Amazon Direct provided video, but unfortunately, the download was not compatible with Apple. Product was OK, could play, but could not project. Amazon Direct is not for me. But, they did refund purchase price. I have removed Amazon Direct from my system. Will stick with iTunes and Apple store for electronic downloads and forego Amazon in that category."
5,awsome :),Every thing was good cheep came on time and the quality was vary good as they said it was :)
5,I really enjoyed this film,I really enjoyed the film&the Graphics&Coloring was on point.the voices work&the theme park element gave it the right top of over the top joy you'd enjoy at any age.very creative&also very spirited film to be enjoyed by all.Solid job all the way around with the Presentation&added on features.
5,A wonderfully funny movie! Brings out the child in all of us..,"A very touching, awesome, funny movie! The grandchildren just love it. Was so worth ordering it for them at Christmas! Each character in this movie has a unique personality, especially Dory (played by Ellen DeGeneres). A very endearing movie which will touch your heart. I will say again..thank you Amazon!!"
4,A visual gem,"The storyline is also decent. Keep in mind that this was a movie made for kids, so a few parts of the storyline might appear as cheesy to adults, but this is still a lovely movie and should appeal to all ages. The visuals are amazing, and the story of poor little Nemo is fascinating and heart-rending. There's also a nice array of characters to like, and the evil girl at the dentist's office made a nice touch. Overall enjoyable and entertaining, 4/5 stars."
4,Such a great story!,"My son LOVES this movie. Yes, there are some parts in there that are a tad scary for little guys, but overall it's a heart-warming, adventurous tale!"
4,Good,"It shipped pretty fast, which i loved, but it was a little more scratched than I was hoping for. Overall the movie still played and my son loves it. That's all that really matters!"
5,A great movie in every way,I love Finding Nemo because of it's charm and overall good feeling after watching the movie. It's characters are memorable and unforgettable. I'm serious about the whole unforgettable thing. My two year old sister is obsessed with Finding Nemo and she watches it everyday. I believe that Finding Nemo is a great movie for little kids who love fish and Disney.
4,Great Movie For Kids!!,"This was a great movie for kids, I would surely reccomend thisTo any family with kids.I am sure they would be delighted with it."
5,The Best Picture of 2003,"This was definitely the Best Picture of 2003. The story, the characters, and the technical mastery were all impressive. This is PIXAR'S best film. Finding Nemo covers so much ground in its reasonable running time. I hope it gets nominated for Best Picture(OSCARS). It truly deserves it."
4,Cute story - My grand kids loved it.,"Wonderful family movie. The little ones, 12 and younger will love it. We had to take several breaks ... our grand kids could only keep the 3D glasses for about a half-hour at a time.We reviewed it because you asked. It is good entertainment for the whole family."
1,Comercial rubbish and not suitable for children,"I found this new Pixar movie to be very offensive. This movies should contain subjects directed to children, and not offensive jokes that only adults can understand. It is very irritating that Disney is losing it's magic. Kids should be the aim of these pictures, not stupid 15 year old and older guys."
5,LOVE this movie!,Our entire family loves Finding Nemo - and we really loved watching it on Blu-Ray. The movie is beautiful to watch over and over again. Great for the entire family.
5,This is a great Movie,"My children who are 2 and 7 LOVE this movie. They want to watch it every day. For my two year old, it is hard to find a movie that she will sit and watch. So far though, everytime I put it on she sits and watches the whole thing! The characters are loveable, and quoteable. We all walk around saying parts of the movie. All I can say is this movie is the best movie I have seen since The Lion King."
3,"Nemo's good, Monsters is better","Finding Nemo is a cute movie for sure. Ellen Degeneress lends her voice and makes is a funny movie. Nemo is vivid with beautiful colors, and again, is cute, but lacks some of the creativity of Toy Story, and Monsters, Inc. The story does have an underlying deep meaning which I can totally appreciate."
1,Pixar joins Disney at rock bottom.,"This movie had to be one of the stupidest I've ever seen. Unlike the previous Disney/Pixar efforts, this one isn't even remotely interesting. The writers, from the looks of it, probably spent too much time working on the plot, and as a result it feels MUCH lacking, even moreso than A Bugs Life. Not to mention that the film could have been ended a LOT earlier had they cut some of the uneeded parts out. The jokes just aren't funny, and it's not for kids, as some parts will more than likely make them cry. The visuals are decent, I guess, they're typical of what Pixar's been doing, no more, no less. Overall, this is a very bad Disney film, and a disappointing Pixar film. If you really need a Pixar movie, I suggest the Toy Story movies or even Monsters Inc, or if you just need a CGI movie, Shrek 1."
1,Finding answers for my kid,"Two months after I took my son to see this, he was still asking what happened to Nemo's mom....Too sad that killing parents is still the best they can figure out to make a ""childrens' movie..."
1,Very Dissapointed.,"Huge grossing movies are usually far from the best nowadays but I kept hearing no this really is great. This movie is the pinnacle of average Saturday morning cartoon/Full House humor aka non-entertaining humor. The plot doesn't matter cause you know what's gonna happen. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Disney/Pixar hater; I just caught a little Toy Story on Disney and I could still enjoy it even though I had watched it many many times. The only jokes that made me giggle were the times the blue fish called Nemo Fabio and 1 more that most people won't get."
1,yay,"i loved this movie it waz so adorable! i am sevin years old my name is danielle and i prefer movees like these the fish were cute. it was a very funny movee i didn't see this movee but my moms going to get it for my birth dayluv,danielle"
3,This has not aged well,"I had not realised just how poorly this film has aged. Technically it is outstanding but the plot is purile, the humour flat and the dialogue plain cheesy. Compared to the sharpness of earlier masterpieces such as The Jungle Book, Robin Hood and the recent Rango this is just weak. I could hardly get through to the end. 5 for technology 2 for storyline."
3,Finding Nemo,"When I first saw Finding Nemo, I thought it was okay. It is not, I repeat, NOT the best movie ever. Sure it was funny and I liked Dory but the scene when Bruce's eyes turned black and he chased Marlin and Dory around was definitely not what I expected. It is good enough for DVD and I hope you consider this before you buy the movie."
2,Good Customer Service-Bad Product,"When my purchase arrived one of the two discs was broken and the other was badly scratched. It was not ""slightly used"" as the description indicated. When I emailed to inquire about what I should do, however, the response was very quick. I mailed the item back and the refund was nearly instantaneous. So although the product was not as described the customer service for the return was very good."
2,what was all the hype?,"this movie, though cute left me a little flat. it was not nearly as funny as ice age and monster's inc.. thou ellen degeneres was very funny as the spacy fish the movie just kind of fell flat in my opinion"
3,Good,I had a hard time finding just a DVD. Didn't need bluray but bought this anyway. Maybe someday it'll be used; maybe not. The movie itself was a gift nd they loved it.
3,Wrong digital copy,The digital copy was Brave instead of Finding Nemo. It was a gift so they are trying to get it corrected.
5,"""NOT"" FOR KIDS ONLY !","FANTASTIC MOVIE. THE COLOR WAS VIVID. THE CHARACTERS WERE FUNNY.NOW THAT I HAVE FOUND NEMO, HE HAS BEEN ADDED TO MY DVD COLLECTION. DON'T HESITATE TO ADD HIM TO YOURS."
3,SOMETHING FISHY,This film is good value. The people at pixar have put together another great movie. I must admit this movie is very much overrated. It is NOT the best movie I have ever seen. The movie tells the story of a fish called Nemo who gets kidnapped by a diver. Marlin(Nemos dad) and his friend Dory (who has short term memory loss) must find Nemo who is trapped in a fish tank at a dental surgery. great laughs with Dory and a good storyline but definetely not the best youll ever see. Watch Shrek instead.
5,COOL TRIVIA!!!!!!!!,"Sweet movie!Trivia:Meanings of names:Nemo: Latin for 'nobody'.Marlin- type of fish.Coral- coral.Dory- type of fish.Gill- gillDeb/Flo- ebb and flow.Bloat- getting bigger.Bubbles- bubbles.Gurgle- gurgle.Jacques- James and Jack, in French.Peach- peach.Pearl- pearl.Tad- tadpole.Sheldon- SHELL-don.Bruce- Australian male name.Chum- food.Anchor- anchor.Funny fact- 'Elmo' might be a reference to a relation of Princess Mary of Denmark, Matthew 'Elmo' Elmas.The song 'Beyond the sea' was originally sung by Bobby Darin."
2,Huh?,"I rented this because of all the good things I heard about it. I loved the Toy Story movies and Monsters, Inc. but I didn't see the big deal with this one.Also, while watching this I realized that every disney cartoon or 3D animation movie, the main character only has one parent. They either die or just aren't there. In some there are even none. The only movie I can think of that doesn't fit this is 101 dalmations, but that kinda had to work."
3,Biggest Disappointment of the Year!! Yay Rah!!!,"Whoever thinks this is movie of the year is stupid. I gotta admit, it has a few funny parts but that is not enough for it to be called better than Along Came Polly, School of Rock, Scary Movie 3, or Bruce Almighty. Spend your hard earned cash on one of those 4 movies not this one!"
3,"Good, if you like this sort of thing.","I do not like computer-animated children's films like Shrek, Monster's Inc., etc., but I bought Finding Nemo because many respected reviewers had placed it on their Top Ten lists. The animation was terrific, of course, but the simple characterizations, simple story and contrived 'hollywood' humor left me bored and fast-forwarding to the credits. This film is no different than Shrek, Ice Age, and the other modern kids' comedies. Not bad, just not up my alley."
3,GREAT MOVIE FOR KIDS,"The Academy Award-winning creators of TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE, and MONSTERS, INC. dive into a whole new world with this underwater adventure. The film follows the comedic and eventful journeys of two fish - Marlin and his son Nemo - who become separated in the Great Barrier Reef when Nemo is unexpectedly taken far from home and thrust into a fish tank in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney harbor. Buoyed by the companionship of a friendly-but-forgetful fish named Dory, the overly cautious father embarks on a dangerous trek and finds himself the unlikely hero of an epic journey to rescue his son - who hatches a few daring plans of his own to return safely home. This I is a good movie for the kids, it has some funny moments and it looks good on a big screen"
5,The grandkids love it! Especially blu-ray,"I love the colors on Blu Ray, the colors are vibrant and sharp. The quality of the movie is excellent."
5,Bought this for our 16 month old,"She hated it, prefers Shrek. While she played and did not pay attention, my wife and I watched the whole thing. Good movie, very funny."
1,Not Good,"I did not like this movie at all. At some parts it is so childish that no one over 4 could watch it. Then it would go to something that would be impossible for any child to understand. This made the movie to hard to follow. The only real entertaining part of the movie was Dori the fish because she was extremely funny. Also the beginning was good, but it was far too much for children to handle."
1,G Rating Very Inappropriate,"A G rating of film implies that it is appropriate for all ages. This movie includes a scene of Nemo's mother and all of his siblings being killed. Next, he is captured and his father, who has been too traumatized by his wife's killing to even leave his home, has to find his son and save him before Nemo is killed. Although this movie is lovely to look at and is funny for adults at times, it is irresponsible to tell parents to show it to their young children. In addition to the violent death of Nemo's family and his own impending doom, there are other violent and scary images in this movie that young children should not see. My child told me after the movie that he was very scared. I am giving this movie one star because it was irresponsibly marketed to young children and their families and given a rating that was inappropriate for the subject matter."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD THAT IT GIVES ME NIGHTMARES ABOUT CLOWNFISHES. THE MAIN CHARACTER NEMO IS A MUTATED FAILURE FISH WHO CANNOT SWIM AND HAS A FIN SMALLER THAN THE OTHER ONE. ALSO, THE CHARACTER OF DORRY IS MENTALLY RETARDED AND SHE IS WHACKED IN THE HEAD WITH A BASEBALL BAT. THE JOURNEY TO FIND NEMO IS THE LAMEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. THIS MOVIE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MADE AND WHOEVER HAS THIS SHOULD FLUSH IT IN THE TOILET. ONCE AGAIN DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS FISH CARTOON."
1,Worst movie,"Words fail me to discribe how horiable this movie is. Of corse when pixar and disny come together the resld is pure junk. Dont waste your hard earned money on this junky movie. It is not even worth 1 cent let alone (...). If you want a horiable movie that has not a nanogram of humor or replay value, buy this. This movie should come with a knive so you could stab yourself insted of watching it. I would have given this movie negitive satrs if I could. Conclusion: Not funny, Not cute, Not worth (...)."
4,Won't stop watching!,"My two year old absolutely LOVES this movie! Which is surprising because no cartoon without music has caught his attention for more than 5 minutes. But not Nemo, he sits so calmly and quitely and watches this movie from start to finish. He'd watch it over and over if I let him."
5,One if the nicest,"My grandson will watch this movie over and over. Great morals, funny, memorable characters... I can sit through it with him many many times."
3,Too scary for some,"My 2.5 year old daughter asked me throughout the movie what had happened to the mama fish (she was eaten by a shark). When mama fish didn't miraculously come back from the dead or wake up from a coma at the end of the movie, I had to tell my daughter that she had been eaten. Since then, it's ""no like Nemo."" Single moms might think twice before letting their very young kids see this."
1,Lame,"I did not like this movie. Then again, I'm a grown man. My 3 year old lost intrest. A couple scenes scared him. Also a bit long for us."
5,Pure pleasure to the eyes,"The animation of this film is absolutely mind-boggling. Although being familiar with computers I still have no idea how Pixar managed to create this beautiful underwater world. In every scene the reflection of the sun sparkles through the water. Technically this film is a work a great art.The storyline is strong and contains an undeniably pleasant moral: if parents were a bit more easy going and children were a tad more restrained then families would get on better. Along the way it also promotes understanding of differences in the way we are or behave.As usual with Pixar the humour is everywhere, from the Sharks Anonymous (who try to stop eating fish) to the Ninja crab and the laid back current surfing giant turtles.This film is not only a thoroughly fascinating underwater ride but a beautiful showcase of American filmwork.A must for anyone who has children, nieces, godchildren ..."
5,A Must See,"I thought Finding Nemo was a pretty good movie for kids and grown-ups alike because it teaches us about relationships and the responsibilities involved and how even though we are separated love never dies if it is a parent/child or a romatic interest. Crush will relate to the ""cool"" generation, Dorie to the older ones, and of course Nemo to the young ones."
2,What's the big deal?,"While Finding Nemo is visually stunning, it really wasn't all that good. In fact, the only good part for me was when the little girl walks in and the Psycho theme plays. If you want to see an outstanding Disney/Pixar film, see The Incredibles, it was actually entertaining. I know my view doesn't count for much, seeing as how everyone else absolutly loves this movie, just keep in mind, it really isn't all it's cracked up to be."
2,DVD didnt work,The DVD is now defective and will not play in any DVD player. It worked twice and then after it is saying it is a unreadable disc. Not exactly sure why it worked at first but I tried it in 2 different players and it no longer works.
2,Sad and Scary for little ones,"The film begins with the murder of the mother fish and 399 of the 400 unhatched babies. Only dad and one egg (Nemo) survies. So already, children feel the fear of abandomnemt and the horror of the realization that mom and/or dad can die and leave them without a parent. This theme continues throughout the film, with Nemo being kidnapped by humans becuase he didn't listen to his dad, and both Nemo and dad facing deadly circumstances and several incidents when the audience is supposed to believe that one or the other is dead or greviously injured. The animation is beautiful and the voices well-acted, but the mildly humorous aspects within the film are greatly overshadowed with sadness and grief and abandonment issues. (Not to mention reinforcing the sterotypical fear of dentists.) I would NOT recommend this film for young children."
3,"A good movie, though somewhat over rated","Finding Nemo is the tale of a little fish, Nemo, becoming lost from his overprotected father and then the father's quest to find Nemo. Not your usual children's movie with several well known quotes (""Just keep swimming""; ""I speak whale! OOOOOOOOOOO"") A very cute little movie, though I feel it has been slightly over rated by all the Nemo-Lovers, is worth seeing my children and even adults, just for the experience."
2,Rent before you Buy,"I am a big fan of Pixar Animation Studios' films(Monster's Inc., A Bug's Life and Toy Story), but this one does not reach the same comedic level as those that came before it.The humor is really limited to a green sea turtle (who lasts in the movie for 5 minutes) and a few short conversations between Ellen Degeneris' character and different species of animals throughout the ocean.I am not a big Ellen fan, but she was definitely the highpoint of this film's humor. The main character was just kind of flat, and didn't really give Ellen the platform to be as funny as she could have been as the color commentator sidekick.Don't get left high and dry, rent before purchasing. You won't miss it.The DVD has some really cool features, including (but not limited to) both widescreen and fullscreen renditions of the movie.A tour through the Pixar Animation studios (led by Nemo's real life counterpart).And you can turn your tv into a fishtank."
5,cute,This movie is so cute. I watched even without the grandkids! The message that one can persevere even if the underdog is great.
3,Good clean fun,"There's a lot to like here, in a predictable, family-safe kind of way. It's family-positive, father-positive, and demonstrates bravery, friendship, and tolerance of those who require tolerance. (In truth, Dory would have driven me bonkers.)A few point rise above the sea-level of banality. Everything having to do with the seagulls is great, and kibitzing over the dentist's shoulder is a hoot. The turtles are cool (but they know that), and the minor characters in the tank really help. A few other points (""You made me ink!"") are fun.This movie never meant to break new ground, and doesn't. It's fun. Depending on how your little one handles mildly threatening scenes, it's probably kid safe. The animation is good, but that's normal these days.It's a sound, reliable entertainment product. Unless your friends all wear black all the time, it's OK to enjoy this one. You just might not remember much of it after you return it to the video store.//wiredweird"
3,Something for Everyone,"One of the most overhyped animated movies of the last years, ""Finding Nemo"" is a visual delight, presenting a competent (if somehow predictable) all-ages story that manages to entertain and offer a few surprises along the way. It`s a worthwile and funny film with some hilarious moments (the sharks are great and way clever idea, as is Dory`s character, which prove that Pixar`s creators still have a couple of witty and innovative concepts). However, it`s far from being the masterpiece that so many claim it to be. It doesn`t bring nothing new aside from some visual delights, given that the storyline follows the classic Disney pattern (thankfully, it avoids the dull songs and the over-the-top cheesy moments). As a whole, though, it works rather well, combining its elements to provide an engaging and convincing cinematic experience.Worth finding."
1,CRAP!,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!IT HAS ALOT OF . . . MOMENTS IN IT AND EVERYBODY IN THE MOVIE ACT THEY ARE HIGH!IT EVEN BROKE MY SISTERS DVD PLAYER AND MY PS2!THE ONLY THING THIS IS GOOD FOR IS A FRIZBEE!DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
1,Boring,"The first time I saw this movie I'll admit I liked it. But when I watched it for a second time, I realized what an awful movie it is. It was just so boring. I couldn't stand to watch it. And it really makes no sense. I mean, fish don't really care that much for their offspring. They lay tons of eggs, and some die. It just annoyed me how the fish were acting like people. And what's the deal, with the sharks not eating fish? What else would they eat? They survive off of fish. Ugh. I don't understand how so many people can like this. I really hate this movie."
5,Nemo,What do kids like more than a good pixar flick. The same good pixar flick in 3D. It was shipped fast and I got it in unopened condition
5,:D,I love this. And so does my 6 month old daughter now. She has been watching this from the time she was 1 month old. :D
3,"Good for adults and older kids, but...","My husband took our 3 1/2 year old son to see this movie in the theater when it came out. Our son actually made it almost all the way to the end of the movie, but many other parents had to leave early with their kids, and my husband had to ""talk down"" our son a few times to calm him down. This is not a mellow movie for young children. True, there's no major violence, swear words or sex, but it's INTENSE. The movie starts with Nemo's mother and siblings being eaten. Then he gets captured and his father goes looking for him, encountering lots of danger along the way. It's very emotionally scary for a young child. My husband said lots and lots of young children were screaming and crying in the theater. I later saw the movie on dvd and liked it personally. It's well done, and funny. That being said, if you have a preschooler, it might be better to wait on this one."
5,Finding Nemo,"I was looking for this DVD around town. and i wasnt going to pay 19.99 for this so i decided to look on here. and wha la. i found it for a great price. i was expecting it to be a week or two before i got it. ordered on a friday late and recieved it no later then tuesday that next week, in the mail."
5,Nemo is neato,Who doesn't like Finding Nemo? If you haven't seen it - why not? Doesn't everyone love this movie? Appropriate for adults and children. Some of the scenes can be a little frightening for very young children (the opening scene and the scene with the sharks). But it is a classic and shouldn't be missed.
5,DISNEY's never been so reasonably priced!,"Got this used DVD, it works great! Good delivery time, would definitely do business here again."
4,satisfied,Works great! :) & case wadnt too bad of shape... my 2 year old son loves nemo. Deff interested in purchasing any Disney movies in the very near future.
4,Righteous! Righteous!!!,"Do believe the hype. Finding Nemo immediately captures the viewer's heart and imagination. It's absolutely thrilling! A great story told with stunning craftsmanship. Yes, it's as gorgeous as they say. The extras are fun, but I was surprised that there was absolutely nothing on the voice talent. That's the only disappointment."
5,A Nautical Adventure,"Probably in my Top 3 films of the year Finding Nemo suprised me in on an unimaginable level. A complete left turn from the computer wizards at Pixar this almost real film ranks in among my favorite films of all time. The story immerses you into the deepest realms of the ocean. The coral reef scenes are spectacualr to view, especially on HD televisions, and the sound is great too. The cast headed by Albert Brooks, and the scene stealing Ellen Degeneres, was awesome (Ellen being the best) The film is probably one of the funniest films I have ever seen, and the film doesn't just target children. Everyone should see this film once, if not more."
5,Great family film,Visually this is the best and the story is real heart felt. My personal animated favorites are still Little Mermaid and Alladin but this is right up there. Lot's of fun extras on the dvd for kids. Voices are done great and I liked this better than Toy Story 1/2.
5,Great Family Movie Night!,"This is one of those movies that is perfect for you family movie night. Our son (9) loves it just as much as my husband and I do. If your child gets scared easily there are a couple of scenes that might frighten them a little, watch for the shark scenes. They start out ok, but then the sharks start chasing and it's a bit intense for kids who are easily scared. My son was ok with it after seeing it a couple of times and learning what to expect though."
4,Really Good,"I really liked this movie. It's cool for Adults and children. If you like disney movies you will like this one. It is interesting being in a ""In a fish point of few"". Whenever you are in a different P.O.V. you are getting a great learning experience."
2,so overrated.....grating synthetic visuals,"I'll start with the visuals which obviously led people to so overrate this middling effort. The visuals were indeed technically impressive and beautiful at times. But to me these synthetic, digital images are hard on the eyes after a few minutes, and just plain grating. Take us back to real drawings.But I suppose the delightful scenes of the reef are what led people to so overrate this movie. The basic story line of finding the lost son is so simple it is hard to call clever. The purported tension of the movie -- repeated life threatening encounters -- became tediously predictable. The humor was usually strained, and supposedly funny riffs (memory loss, whale talk)were repeated to the point of tedium."
4,Finding Nemo is a contemporary disney/pixar classic,"This movie is fantastic. I would only hope that disney created a fantastic dvd for this wonderful movie. The people at pixar are wonderful film makers. The best part about this movie as well as other pixar pictures, is the films ability to maintain a balance of adult humor as well a something that the children in the audience can laugh at. This is a touching story about a clown fish named marlin (brooks) who is journeying to find his now captive son nemo. Along the way, marlin runs into some very interesting and diverse characters including a forgetful but sweet blue fish named dori, who is played by elen degenerous. Like all of the voice talents in this movie, (Degenerous) is absolutly hilarious and plays this part with heart, humor, and is irisitable. I would highly recommend this film to any one of any age. I think this is a classic movie with many memorable moments as well as characters..........PLEASE SEE IT!!!"
4,Very Exciting And Interesting!!!,"I was taking a nap the other day while my master was watching this. Pretty soon the movie had my undivided attention. I know it was a cartoon and all, but the underwater world is a world that dogs just don't get to see. The movie was so well done and looked so realistic (I am assuming anyway) that I almost couldn't follow the story, but the story was great anyway. If the folks at the Pixar studios ever do a story about dogs, you can bet I'll see it (I just wish theaters would let dogs in so I don't have to wait until they come out on video)."
5,Great movie,Willem Defoe is a bit more appropriate here than in Antichrist. Probably better for children in this one. Not sure.
2,IT SUCKED I HATED IT,"This movie was horrible I hated it and thats a surprise, because I usually like Disney and Pixar movies.The only reason this piece of trash got 2 stars from me is because the little turtle( i think his name is Squirt) is cool ( star 1). The second star is because I felt bad only leaving one star. I may hate this movie but I love it compared to sept. 22 reviewer from Freddy vs. Jason. Well thats it, this move blows don't see it. 'till next time everybody. Later"
2,"Pretty, but insipid","With all the hype surrounding this film, I expected it to at least be entertaining. While my family loved Toy Story and a Bug's Life, we were unanimous in giving this film a ""blah"". The animation is very well done, but the characters are uninteresting, there is no chemistry be tween them and the plot is one long wandering effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to bring in other minor characters in an attempt to bring some interest to the film.Dory's memory problem is annoying and brings nothing to the story. The best part of the film are the characters in the aquarium, but that is damning with faint praise.If you are older than 8, find a better way to waste a couple hours of your life."
2,Did anyone else notice the little anti-American remark?,"It happens when our two fish heroes are hauled to that shark ""ten-step"" meeting, Nemo's father tell about what happened to his son, that he was taken by human divers. The sharks reply about the divers, ""they think they own everything. Yeah, probably Americans.""From there the cartoon went downhill from there for me."
2,Finding Nemo,"I don't care how good the graphics are, any cartoon which contains so much death and violence in the first 10 minutes is not something I would recommend for parents of any children.I am not advocating removal of violence in movies - I like cowboy flicks and cop shows, but for heaven's sake - where was the fun in this story? My mother and I - both of whom are far old enough to know good movies when we see them - were shocked at how depressing the cartoon was. I don't know nor care how the rest of the film was - we won't be watching any sequels nor recommending it to anyone!It was perfectly ghastly."
2,ITS OVER OKAY SHUT UP!,THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD THE FIRST TIME BUT AFTER YOU SEE IT AFTER THAT ITS ANNOYING. I'M TIRED OF IT. ITS TO OVER RATED. SHUT UP ALREADY!
2,Why does any story have to start with the death of the parent?,My kids really didn't need that. If you feel that way too... try some of the Pippi movies.
1,Complete overrated rubbish!,"Dude,before you decide to watch this movie,don't watch this movie.It's the biggest load of crap ever.Sure,the animation is great,but that's really the only good thing about it.Dory the bluefish turns this into a one-joke film,and it's funny for about half an hour before it grows old.It disappoints me that Disney may stop making traditional animation films after Home on the Range.Finding Nemo is so terrible that they should reconsider and stop making their CGI films after the Incredibles,which I could boycott after seeing the trailer.And their traditional animated films are improving after such a while.I loved Brother Bear(whe's the DVD coming?),and I loved Lilo and Stitch(when's the real sequel coming?)but when Dory starting speaking like a whale,I literally yawned like a whale.It sucks.I apologise to all the five star reviewers out there,but yes,it sucks."
1,"Don't Order ""Region 2""","Region 2 discs cannot be played on most US technology, don't buy them. I wish I would have known this beforehand."
1,this is b.s,The movie is covered in scratches and will not play!!!! It's b.s cause my kids was excited waiting for it to come in the mail and then it wouldn't play..u don't sale dvd's in that condition!!!
1,It should be called EATING NEMO.,"If I sit through Finding Nemo ever again, I swear I will shoot myself.It is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, with jokes that lead nowhere.Althought the animation was pretty good, a cutsie aspect was terrible and pretty unbelievable.Monsters Inc was better for the kids and adluts.Im sick and tired of people saying that Finding Nemo is the best Disney....ARE THEY FORGETTING THE LION KING and other classic such as Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and Sleeping Beauty."
5,Supa-Genius!,"The guys at Pixar have really out done themselves this time. I love all of their movies to date, but this one is by far the best! I would give it 10 stars, but I'm limited to only five. This movie contains non-stop action and comedy! All I have to do is think about some of my favorite scenes and I just start cracking up. The thing that really sets this movie apart from all of the others is the quality of the animation. Many of the images are simply amazing! One of my favorite scenes is when Nemo and is friends are on their way to school. The images of the reef as they swim by are spectacular. I also love the images of Sydney. They look so realistic.I've waited over 8 months for this movie (that's when I saw the first trailer) and it was well worth it! Now I can't wait for it to be released to DVD so I can watch it as often as I like and see all of the behind the scenes special features."
4,Pixar scores again,"I'm a college boy, and I'm not afraid to admit that Pixar is the best film company today. Monsters Inc and the Toy Stories don't get old, and Nemo won't either. The underwater world that was created is incredible and the characters have the usual down to earth charm that makes Pixar so successful. Nemo continues Pixar's run of excellence. One complaint that I have is that the short film was god-awful. Definitely a step down from the Monsters Inc short. But Nemo rocks. So go see it."
5,GREAT KNIFE!,"I've collected knives for forty years, this is absolutely the best knife for it's price available anywhere. The high carbon steel is top notch, sharpens easy,and stays sharp through rough use. A great everyday carry knife and an excellent field/survival blade. Try one and you will not be disappointed!"
2,Horrible Production Value,"I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD. The production value is really bad. The music is okay, kind of relaxing, but the video is so terrible. The camera is shaky at times and the scenes are poorly composed. When the camera isn't shaky, it's panning and zooming at a jerky rate. It's really a shame because you can tell the locations are nice, but the way it was shot is really amateurish and the camera used is of a very low quality. They also didn't keep in any of the sound of the waves or the background...just a few birds chirping. Don't buy this."
1,Very Disappointed,"Don't believe the description!!!! This item's description says it's 18 by 22 inches. WHAT A LIE!!! It was just delivered, and it seemed so tiny, so I measured it, measured it from the OUTSIDE of the frame, and it's only 16 by 19 inches!!! Talk about complete and total false advertisement!! I am very disappointed that I was misled like this and caused this extra frustration. I am sending this item back and getting my money returned, and I will NOT order any more items that come from art.com, because they are obviously not honest at all, and you do not get what you order or pay for."
1,Map of the World print,The product is NOT the size that it says it is. It is much smaller. I was disappointed.
3,"music fan,of birmingham ala aug 8 2002","I have had this cd along time i forgot about it,i found the cd 2 years later and it still sound good.I only like 3 songs on the hole cd, i wonder what happen to tommy tate? I hate he only made one cd, but it's ok i have this one this cd is realy ok if you never heard his music.Mr. Tommy Tate if you do read this i hope you make it big some day if your still around."
5,Good sprayer,I have tried most kinds of sprayers. This works better than most as it's higher mounted pump is very effective.
5,LOVE IT!!!,"This is an old movie done in the early Mel Gibson days and it is fabulous. The soundtrack just completely adds the tone and enhances the movie but it also stands on its own very well. Great as background for a quiet dinner for two at home or for reflecting alone with a bottle of Gamay Beaujolais. If you're watching the movie itself, however, be sure to put down the wine before the hot tub scene begins or you'll be cleaning up wine stains and probably shattered glass---yep, it's that good."
3,Soundtrack better than the Movie by a joint!,"Soundtrack: The best cut here is of course thetitle cut with Cheap Trick's Rob Zander takingturns sobbing over mic with Heart's burely AnnWilson! It went to number #4 in Pop. musiccountdown. Dave Grusin is good here as wellas the rest of artists on this soundtrack.***starsThe Movie: Cleancut Mel Gibson (the perpetuallyconfused man) is miscast here as a drug dealer('Snake' Russell [see Escape(s) From New York /L.A.] is miscast as a clean cut cop! MichellePfeiffer (Above Average 'Baker Boys' [""Fabulous""is too strong a word. Just like ""Fabulous Thun-derbirds""!] is miscast as the woman caught inbetween! Aside from that and a bad ending, thiswas A GOOD MOVIE! *** stars"
1,A so so soundtrack!,"I recommend this soundtrack strictly for the David Sanborn song ""Joanne's Song"". Unfortunately, you can't find it on any of David's other recorded material. This soundtrack is really not all that good."
2,Painfully horrible duet with Ann Wilson and Robin Zander...,"Some decent songs by Crowded House, Ziggy Marley, Bobby Darin, Andy Taylor and The Church. Some very bad songs by Duran Duran, Dave Grusin and The Everly Brothers with The Beach Boys doing ""Don't Worry Baby"". And a painfully horrible duet with Ann Wilson and Robin Zander."
5,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,THE BROTHER HL 5250DN has execded my expection by far. I use it for almost all of my printing. It does photographs well enough for most business needs. Speed is super it will print one job I do every week in 2 min 10 sec. that used to take 35 min. One of the best buys I have ever made!!!
3,"No problem with Windows, issues with OSX","No problem setting up to use with the PCs in my network, caused some problems with OSX istallation, in fact, cannot use it with my Mac and am still fixing problems the installation caused to my iBook."
2,not the best choice,"This is the first product I own from Brother. The defect is that the printer do not detect paper once the paper gets to about half. Its a defect within the paper tray(does not push up), it also clicks after printing. I also know another purchaser that had similar problems.I would send it back to the manufacture to get it fixed, but shopping fees for this big item would be costly, so I just keep the level of paper really high. Also I can't spare a few weeks without a printer.I'd think twice about ordering this product."
2,Decent printer hampered by glaring flaw.,"Our company purchased six of these refurbished units for light duty printing. Unfortunetly all six of the unit's network cards have the same MAC address, meaning only one printer can be installed on the network. I currently have them attached to the computers via USB and they work well, but I will not be able to share these printers as I had intended.Not sure if this affects all of the refurbs or not, but be wary when purchasing.Overall: Worth the price if not networking or not networking more than one."
4,Excellent value; print quality a little less than optimal,"In all respects but one I'm pleased with this printer. It was easy to set up w/ my Mac. It is reasonably quiet, quick to turn out first and subsequent copies, and the duplexing feature works well. However, the image quality is not as good as it might be. At first I thought I must be printing in ""proof"" mode, but in fact I wasn't. Still, for the price, it's a pretty great printer."
3,Not up to Brother standards,I have an older version of this product that works much better. I expected this one to be at least as good. However is is constantly jamming when double side printing. I'm disappointed with this product.
2,Not what I expected,I wanted to see girls and cars. This tape was mainly girls shaking their body parts. Not what I expected. If you want a tape with just hott chicks at car shows and NO CARS! this tape is for you. Want to buy my copy? Half off.
2,not what I expected,"Although this is not what I expected ( too small for my cat), it is very durable and perfect for the cat that eats once a day. If your cat is an eater all through the day, this will be too small for them."
5,Absolutely Amazing to watch!,"Gould, although bizarre, is amazing to watch. People criticize him, but no one can Imitate his Left handed nature. One tape has a Very young Gould in a dark studio playing Partitas, I never heard it played like that ever on any Recording, breathtaking! I have all these Tapes, they have changed the thinking behind my performance."
1,Never recieved it,"Don't ever order from this seller, I was charged for this item and never recieved it, It was supposed to be a christmas present for my son,And he loves BIG BIRD. Oh well."
5,Aviation Law,"Good informative book, I'm not a lawyer but I still need to know how to cover my a$$ as a commercial pilot. This book and the ""fundamentals of aviation law"" are a must have if you are a pilot."
5,One Word: Awesome,"I rented this video from the library. IT WAS AWESOME!!! Even though the music was outdated and the clothes were outdated too. (IE. Skinny jeans and baggy shirts!), it was still really great. I rented this along with Claudia and the Missing Jewels (IE. Little Ashley Greene as Karen! :O). And the theme song, OMG!! I love it! Also, is it just me or does Dawn look like Rikki from H2O? :D"
4,the ultimate track is on this album...,""" Comin Like Dat "" is seriously in my top 10 of all time as far as tracks go...Rick Rock puts in top grade beats here..San Quinn kills it..She is so under appreciated it's sad..Slappers all day on here ."
4,Great for Making Sykpe Calls without a Computer,"I just received the phone and it works as expected. I like the fact I don't need a computer to make calls on Skype. I upgraded the software to the latest version. There are only two issues I could find with it. One, I don't think you can use the phone to make conference calls with Skype. Two, it does not support multilingual characters. I have names in my contact list in Japanese, but it does not display the characters. Other than that, I think it is a good product."
2,nothing special at all,"worked like it should in networks that you have access to, but even some open networks require manual ip address entry etc that's hard to pull off for every hotspot in the are without major time investment. battery life was entirely too short: ~a day. when it works, it works just like any other cell, minus a few things like waiting for it to have service before anything can load on the screen."
4,Nice device!,"I love the fact that firmware is GPL. Maybe some day somebody will hack it to enable the phone to run a proper SIP client, and not proprietary Skype.In terms of Skype it runs well. I miss a web browser to authenticate to hotspots... so basically only useable if you have your own WiFi LAN at home...Happy with the phone."
1,Horrible product. A nightmare to use it!!!,"I would not reccommend buying this product. It is a big pain to use this device. Frequent drop calls, no outgoing caller ID are few problems I faced!!!"
1,"run from this if not a geek,or working for linksys","this wi-fi- fone is one hot looking fone and i was in love whan it came in mail ! i will not give it 0 ,had fone not evin a day and all calls to linksys was bad and not helpfullall thy sayed is call the ones you got it from for help !ok 3 of 7 calls to linksys guys sayed that ,not all ,and or sayed send it back to whar you got it fromi/we was doing a update it ,so all of the fone wood work but it is no go(all the bad things sayed about this wi-fi fone is true!i.e. no hand free use ,and linksys dos not care about it !? as of my calling ,so do not get this hot looking fone if you be a geek go for it! by the way amazon rocks big time all ways good to me !!!!"
2,Great Idea - Lousy Implementation,"I bought this phone mainly for free Skype-to-Skype calls - especially overseas and get rid of my VoIP line.The phone worked great out of the box and I'm still impressed with the voice quality and easy of use. However, even after applying the latest release...1) The battery is a piece of junk !! It does not last more than a couple of hours after you've made a call or two.2) The screen does not go off when the phone is ON and it's charging...3) The headset jack does not work !!4) Speakerphone - it's supposed to have one but I can't figure out how to activate it.I just bought this last week, and will try tech support if I can get some answers - if not I'm glad I did not stop my other service.I still hope there is a plan to make a higher capacity battery and s firmware upgrade should fix the other problems.. well hopefully if Linksys is listening.Cheers!"
4,Non-standard headset jack,"The headset jack which other reviewers say is broken ornon-functional is in fact a non-standard 4 connector jack (mostheadset jacks are 3 connector, one for earphone sound, one for micinput, and one for ground).Some mobile phones have stereo sound for MP3 playback, and use a 4connector jack, but Skype is not a stereo service. There is nodocumentation from Linksys on what the pinout of that 4 connector jackis.If you use an adapter cable such as the PPC Techs XDA/SX56 2.5mm STDMono Headset Adaptor, it allows you to use a standard headset with theWIP320.MobilePlanet sells that adapter, I have tested it today, and itfinally allows me to use a standard Plantronics headset with myWIP320."
3,"Poor battery life, can't keep network connected","I bought the phone just before the Holidays and it works ok when it's connected to the network. The battery lasts just over 6 hours in standby so I leave it connected most of the time to the charger.I have a problem with it rebooting after some failure modes, and then not being able to connect to my network unless I change the network's broadcast channel. Linksys support isn't able to help much (so far).Nice looking phone, sounds great when it works, for the short periods of time the battery stays charged."
3,"Good for our situation, but...","We purchased this phone in Februrary '08, & over the last six months have been pleased. We live aboard a sailboat in the Caribbean, & Skype is the only good (cheap + reliable) calling option. The phone seems to be as good as the internet connection. Sometimes excellent; other times not so. The battery is fine for our sometimes hour-long calls with plenty of juice left. What I don't get is why the price has gone up so much. We paid $119 with free shipping. It's worth that much. For $259, get a headset & use the computer! Not worth the expense."
1,Limited functionality... does not connect to networks consistently,"I will not get into all of the complaints listed in the other reviews -- each of which is more or less relevant depending on your needs and expectations.I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the sporadic and inconsistent manner in which it was able to connect to wireless networks.... that is, it connects perfectly in certain places and does not connect AT ALL in other places.You CANNOT depend on this device to connect to any wireless network... whether you have the appropriate security keys or not.If you don't have a Linksys router where you intend to use this phone, you are taking a chance when you buy it. The good news is that it is extremely easy to return to Amazaon.It's a shame really... because when it works... it works well."
4,"SImple setup, smart design, no charging base","It probably only took me 10 minutes before I was making Skype, Skype-in, and Skype out calls. Network recognition and setup couldn't have been simpler. I'm guessing that Skype design has a lot to do with simplicity of this so I won't give all the credit to Linksys (I've checked other manuals and the all have pretty much the same features and menus). The only downside is that this phone doesn't have a charging base."
2,Nice design but not more...,"The telephone design is very nice but the batteries last no more than 30 - 40 minutes of speaking. Without speaking the batteries go dead overnight, so my ""wireless"" phone is actually constantly hooked up to the power outlet.Disappointing: There is no stationary charger, which would at least make the constantly charging a little more convenient. Some menu options don't really make sense to me and sometimes the software is bugged, for example when it doesn't allow me to enter letters for the WEP-security code.Unfortuntaely, this telephone is not a suitable replacement for a land line, but makes skype-out calls easier in hotels and other places at which you might not always carry your laptop with."
3,Great attempt ... waiting for more,"There are not many options if you are looking for Skype phone out there. So among them this is a great option.Pros:- Great sound quality ... no delay- Compatible with WEP, WPA-PSK, WPA2-PS, TKIP, AES- connects like a charmCons:- very poor battery time- no text messaging- menu navigation/operation slows down if not rebooted for couple of days- Takes long time to rebootI will definitely wait for second or third generation of Wifi Skype phones."
1,"BAD PRODUCT, WORST AFTER FIRMWARE UPGRADE","the product is inusable;it came with firmware version 1.0 and battery needed to be recharged after every to 2 hours;the backside became hot very fastI upgrade to version 1.16 and now after 15 minutes the battery is empty and the backside burn ( very, very hot)and is impossible to usei dont believe that a product from Linksys a Cisco company is could be so bad ;I do not recomend"
1,"Poor Battery, Can't See Wireless Networks",I was pretty excited about this phone when I first got it. It seemed to work very well at first. Unfortunately they're not kidding about the poor battery life. This one can get a few hours at most out of a full charge. I wouldn't try to talk more than an hour.It also lost connection to our WiFi access point quite often. After two weeks of this I now can not get it to see any of the neighborhood WiFi connections. The phone is now absolutely useless and I am going to the returns page from here.
1,Doesn't Really Work,"Put in my wireless credentials, connected OK. Made a couple of calls--sounded like a bad cell phone connection.Phone crashes, upon restart doesn't remember network settings.After being on for one hour was almost too hot to hold.Returned it."
1,Oh NO!!!!!!,"This Phone is a nightmare, even after updated the firmaware, the battery lasts around 2 hours with little talking and will keep disconnecting from my house's WiFi router after minutes and would be very difficult to reconnect unless I turn off/on the phone. Amazon Rating when more than a couple, are almost right, trust the ratings. I would not buy this phone again at any price because it just doesn't do what it's supose to"
1,Poor Quality,"I always trusted the quality from this brand so when i saw the specifications of this porduct I thought that it was rightwhat I needed. Unfortunatley the battery lasts less than one hour, the quality of the calls is very poor, and the reception is very bad. I tried two telephones of the same model, since I thought i got a damaged one in the first place."
1,POOR QUALITY Linksys WIP320 Linksys Wireless-G Skype iPhone,"Bought this for the Linksys name, thinking it was a quality product. Reception is poor and the battery doesn""t last when not even in use. i won't buy another Linksys product. And I will be telling a friend........"
1,Not worth it in ANY WAY!!,"I never write reviews, but I HAD to make an exception to this item. I just got Skype mainly to use SkypeOut and I decided to get a wifi phone instead of the headsey like I SHOULD have gotten. The battery life is fair, but could be better. It connects to the internet fairly as well, but sometimes there is a connection but I can't use Skype, but that doesn't happen often. The MAIN problem and the reason why I'm giving this item ONE star is the fact that even with a PERFECT connection, the audio quality STILL cuts in and out on SkypeOut calls! There's no reason for that and it makes the concept completely pointless. It cuts in and out with EVERYONE that I've spoken to. Also, sometimes the internet on my computer would find a connection but this Wifi phone does not. I usually give bad items as much of a chance as possible, but I can't tolerate bad audio when I have a PERFECT connection! Will return tomorrow..."
2,Linksys Skype I-Phone,"Operates as described but lacks browser for use in pay for connection environments, poor battery life, need to have it fully charged every day even if you did not use it the previous day. Needs mute function. Volume could be louder, too. I would wait and buy next generation."
2,"Buy the music, not this book","While it may contain every factoid known about Ian and the boys, this book is so difficult to actually read as to be virtually worthless. Sentences are often incomplete, not to mention thoughts or paragraphs, and there is a complete lack of cohesion.If completely rewritten and given a decent editing it might be worthwhile, but that hasn't happened so do yourself a favor and get the remastered version of Stand Up instead."
4,Exellent fan piece,"Any serious Jethro Tull fan will love this book. It provides incredible detail about the band's history, recordings and concerts. Russo's humorous editorial comments are appropriate since Ian Anderson is such a funny guy onstage. Casual fans may find some passages a little boring, but I can't think of a better way to mention the personnel who were in bands with future Tull members.The book contains many (often grainy) black and white photographs of the band, record sleeves, and memorabilia. I would have gladly paid $50 if this book had been printed as nicely as Bruce Spizer's books about The Beatles. I would have given it five stars too."
3,Jethro Tull,"A good overview of the many incarnations of Jethro Tull. A comprehensive historical account, but lacking in the details. Covers all the albums and tours and offers a brief account regarding Ian Anderson's early years, and the beginning of Jethro Tull."
4,well read,"This compilation of Jethro Tull facts and memorbilia is well presented and seemingly quite thourough. Lots of facts and fun images. Could've been ion color, but what the hey it's the title. Thanks Greg Russo for a great compilation."
5,A good start at fighting back,I am pleased to see Dunbar and Donaldson are FINALLY reaching a larger audience by doing the DVD's. National Geographic should feature them each week - Not Cesar Millan.Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful.
2,"Jean Donaldson & Ian Dunbar - ""Fighting Dominance in a Dog Whispering World""","I was very disappointed with the entire disc one of this product; the Jean Donaldson part is something one could glean from a chapter of a book on the science & mythology of dominance theories. Her oration skills are not as professional as one would expect from a so-called-expert, as well.On the other hand, Dr. Ian Dunbar (as always), is stupendous!!! So only disc two makes the product worth keeping in ones collection. Disc 2 has a total running time of: 1 hour & 47 minutes. He is a brilliant, humorous speaker with very note-worthy examples.=^..^=gayhl"
3,Something Happen on the Move West,"Burke fan from way back and Billy Bob Holland is one of my favorite characters. Am not sure why this story seldom really works, maybe too many characters with so many issues it all gets confusing.Burke's prose style will keep you reading even if the story falls to pieces. Not one of his best, maybe the next time around because I'm fonder of Billy Bob than I am of Dave.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,Brooding in the Bitterroots,"A contemporary fictional read taking place in the geography between Lolo Pass and Seeley Lake, Montana. Former Texas Ranger turned lawyer Billy Bob has been married a year to private investigator Temple, who does terrific if unsanctioned intelligence work for him. Is billionaire Karsten Mabus the face of unconquered evil in the book, or is it Wyatt Dixon, a sociopath who tried to bury Temple alive in yet another story? Somehow Wyatt was released early from prison, and here he is in Missoula looking for Billy Bob's assistance to gain the attention of the President. Wyatt is a compelling character: a lean and mean cowboy who found the Lord in prison yet retains the raw machismo needed to defend himself in the legal frontier. Some insiders' insights into Native American thinking, some themes of eco-terrorism, and macho nobility all come together in this great read. Take it along on vacation."
1,James Lee Burke has become a wimp,"In his latest book, James Lee Burke has put together a wimpy, dog tired plea for the ecology that goes nowhere. He has become part of the problem because in his wrap up he simply points out that the good guys never win. The major villain who I believeis patterned after Dick Cheney goes on to continue bribing officials and getting just what he wants for the Oil Industry Lobby or whatever and Burke says that you can't stop them with a bullet and there's always one to replace them if they go down. In fiction, we should see the good guy win, even if it's only on paper, to be reminded of the way things should be. With his wimpy, liberal crying attitude, Mr. Burke simply fosters the idea that that's the way it should be.But Mr. Mabus should die for his sins. The criminals should pay for their crimes and any wimp who can't pull the trigger on themshould never make it to print."
1,In the Moon of the Red Ponies,"Let me preface this review by saying up front, that I have read all of the Dave Robicheau and Billy Bob Holland novels, plus some of the other books that Mr.Burke has written. Obviously, I'm a big fan of this talented writer who has givenme many hours of enjoyment. Unfortunately, all I can say about Burke's latestbook is tsk, tsk tsk! What happened? When did you swing so far left of center?This book is another example of Burke's recent endless rambling without much substance to back it up. I don't know what the cause for this departure from his normally descriptive and interesting prose is, but It seems that Burke is trying tosee if he can start pumping out colorless drivel and still get paid. Shame on him.I only wish I could get a refund on the book. Since that's impossible, I'll just save money by not buying anymore Burke novels."
1,In the blood of vast rightwing conspiracy,"i have read and paid opening price for the great majority of mr.burkes books.i consider myself a true fan;however,if he continues the leftwing drivel and victomhood presented in his recent work,i shall have to put him in the trash heap with poor old willie nelson and the rest of the libs."
4,A good read.,"Redemption of character is the theme in this novel. Billy Bob Holland is the unwilling participant in a plot that concentrates on a number of diverse characters, all of whom trying to redeem themselves in their own eyes.The theme is a common one in Burke's books and one in which I enjoy. This novel is well-written and worth your time in purchasing."
5,excellent author in james lee burke,"haven't read this book yet, but all his other books are wonderful and exciting, so i am sure this book will be also."
2,Very disappointing read,"This is my first Burke novel, and it was extremely disappointing. I didn't like the characters--they were stupid, psychotic, or shallow--some all of the above. The storyline was not well defined in my opinion. The main character, Billy Bob, was dumb as a box of rocks. Myself, being a lawyer, I take offense when an author creates a lawyer-character this stupid. Neither, did he have any loyalty to his clients. He posted the bond for Johnny, which in the real world is unethical. His client, Johnny, had no loyalty to anyone, other than maybe Amber. To sum it up, this was a book filled with unlikeable characters. Darrel, with all his foibles, was probably the only honorable character in the book. I doubt I read another Burke novel. If I can find one on CD, I would probably listen to it. The book did hold my attention, and for that I give it 2 stars."
4,Burke's mastery continues in Montana,"""In the Moon of Red Ponies"" is one of James Lee Burke's novels that features Billy Bob Holland, a defense attorney in Missoula, instead of his better known protagonist, Dave Robicheaux. The Holland books are subtler, taking a little longer to develop and distributing more of the action to the cast of characters. Burke's mastery of scene continues with gorgeous descriptions of Montana's natural riches. The captivating patterns of Burke's writing continue: the problem that can't be ignored by a man of conscience; an assortment of personalities in various degrees of disrepair; moments of startling, violent ferocity; small moments of hard-earned redemption; and the sanctuary of love-making."
2,We need the real Burke back,"I am a huge Burke fan, having read virtually all that he has written. This book and the previous one for that matter are decided drop offs from previous work. The story, plot, his fascinating sentences are just not up to his previous works. I used to read his books slowly to just enjoy the dialogue and the fellings his stories evoke. I read this book just to be finished so I could go on to something else. Read his early books they are brilliant, some of the best books I've ever read."
3,A decent read,"I found this book to be a pretty good read, if a bit unbelievable. The story is never fully tied together and the ending, well the ending... None the less, it was a pleasant time in reading and I was not disatisfied with having spent so, in the end, I think that's a fair assessment of a book - particularly one bought on the discount rack."
2,Disappointing with weak ending.,"I agree with the comments by tobyheaton. Billy Bob, the protagonist, comes across as weak, moralizing and unctuous. I felt like I was reading serial short stories, each ending with an introspective, hoped for insightful fade out. There is an absence of any humor or lightness (unlike, e.g., Elmore Leonard or Robert Parker). The heavy tone unrelenting. The Robicheaux series is much better."
3,Montana Gumbo?,"Having read so many Burke novels set in La., this Montana version is refreshing and interesting, but lacks the punch and authenticity of Robicheaux and gumbo. The ending seems kind of weak."
4,Nbody does it better,"James Lee Burke is a master of language, and one of the only authors of noir ficiton likely to make me re-read the same sentence over and over before going on with the story. I have read every one of his novels at least twice, and this will be no exception. ""Moon of Red Ponies"" is not the best Burke ever (Neon Rain may be that one, or perhaps Electric Mist with Confederate Dead) but this book should be read by everyone who loves crime fiction and good writing, not necessarily in that order. This year it's the new Pellicanos, Harry Shannon's Memorial Day and Burke's Red Ponies at the top of my list."
2,Writing because he can,I've read just about everything Burke has written and this is one of the worst. The various parts just don't fit together and I found myself drumming my fingers and wishing it would just end. I suppose the good news is that it did. More and more the author has his main characters wallowing in self analysis and contemplating their navels at great length. If you like that you like it but there's too much of it for me. In addition the plot is kind of pasted together and imparts no belief that it could happen as written or that it makes sense. And the actions of the protagonist become increasingly tiresome. Enough.
5,Statistical Sleuth 2nd Edition,"I thought I loved statistics before this, but with such clear explanations and good examples I think I will get my masters in stats. The use of high level statistics vocabulary also helps me to get the ladies!"
2,Lied about unopened CD in textbook!,"As promised the book has no marks and is in good condition. However, the selling point: ""Contains UNOPENED CD!"" is untrue. The CD was inside the envelope in the front of the text book, but the envelope had not only been opened...worse, the CD was heavily scratched! The CD appears to run fine with a quick testing-I sure HOPE it does not jam up on me as I begin my coursework though! Wish me luck..."
5,just what I needed,I needed this book for a class and it arrived before the semester started. Easy and perfect. The book looks to be in good shape.
3,Fair,If you are into statistics a good book but if you are taking it because you have to not such a good read.
1,Incomplete book,"You have to think twice in order to buy something for this seller, when I bought this book it does not said that the cd of the book that should came inside the book was missing!!!! It only stand the condition of the book but it should mandatory to tell the consumer if the book is incomplete. Do not trust this seller!!"
1,Crappy book,"Horrible, solution manual is a joke. I could have written a better book than this piece of garbage."
2,The Statistical Sleuth has it's good points...,"This unique book has it's good points. It attmepts to show how to use different types of statistical analyses work together and what order to use them in.However, it is poorly written. The authors will start to use terms and ideas that may or may not be defined two or ten pages later, or maybe in a following chapter and you're never quite sure if something will be explained or whether this is something you should already know. This makes for a slow and aggrevating read to the neophyte. Sometimes it seems like a concise statement of the subjects it addresses, but maybe only after you already have mastered them.If the authors reread the book with a fresh eye, it could be edited and rewritten into a real treasure. Excellent start"
1,very poorly written,"Probably the worst textbook I have ever read. It a very poor job of explaining how to actually perform the calculations and is filled with ramblings that make no sense unless you're already a pro at statistics. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it is not helpful in the least. I am contemplating burning it at the end of the semester."
1,DO NOT BUY - ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR FREE,"This solution's manual is a RIP-OFF!!!It's only a ""Student"" solutions manual, so most of the problems in the book are missing.Also, all the solutions are already available for free at www dot statisticalsleuth dot comDon't buy this book. I returned mine as soon as I figured all this out"
1,Avoid this book.,"I have been using Dreamweaver since version 2 and know it pretty well. I purchased this book for my brother because he wanted to learn about Dreamweaver and how to make a simple site. He told me that he was having problem getting through this book. I took a look at it and sure enough p 25 I hit the first problem. The section talks about adding images to a page, but I haven't made a page to add it to. I went and looked on the author's website and he has a section called errors. There he explains that he thought you would use your own page design not the one in the book, even though in the last chapter you just created the home page for this fictional site. As I continued I found this book riddled with error. My suggestion STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Keep away from this book,"It is very difficult to design a web page just using this book since some of the steps do not work as stated in the book. eg. Page 56, link text internally. Following the steps will get you nowhere fast. If you are thinking of buying this book take my advice and keep looking."
1,This book SUCKS,"In chapter 4 titled 'add tables', there is a section titled 'import tabluar data.' Try as you will, the instructions just DONT WORK, so the book fails right there. One cant continue with the tutorial as this is a important part of the book. On the authers web site ( http://www.waywest.net/dwvqj/ ), under 'errors' he staes he forgot to place it in the zip file. Then he has a link to it. Its in a wacked out .rtf formate and can not be open. Its a corrupt file. Until this section is addressed, the book is trash."
4,A Nice Wi-Fi Detector and Adapter,"If you order this item through Amazon, you may end up receiving it with a white case that has pictures of soccer balls all over it. This is what I had sent to me twice. Like the other reviewer, I also live in the middle of nowhere. When I pass through a small town, this device makes it so easy to locate hotspots. Before, I would keep pressing the scan button on my Palm TX... pretty difficult to do when you're trying to drive. This unit tells you the signal strength and lets you know whether or not a signal is secured. You can browse through all the available hotspots with the push of a button. Apart from the soccer ball artwork, I'm very pleased with it. It would be nice if they designed the cap that covers the USB connection to snap on more securely. Being able to place it on a key chain would also be a big plus."
1,God Awful!!!,"Awful if not down right scary!!! There is no place for a shirtless, hairy, slightly overweight, spaced out man or girls who seem like they are on acid in children's videos. It's just not right.Not even a REAL yoga video, doesn't teach a thing and the interviews with parents are just not here nor there. Don't waste your money!I would have not given any stars except it made you do it....."
5,A celtic Christmas,"I am a new listener to Blackmore's Night. Recently I was looking for some Christmas music for my iPod when I discovered Blackmore's Night's Christmas album WINTER CAROLS. What a treasure WINTER CAROLS turned out to be for me. Whenever I think of Ritchie Blackmore, I think of his hard rock work with Deep Purple. Blackmore's Night is such a contrast to his hard rock days in the '60s and '70s. I immensely enjoyed listening to Candice Night's delicate vocals set to Ritchie's acoustic compositions. There is not a single song on the cd that I did not like. This cd really puts the holiday spirit in me. I rarely buy Christmas cds but I really think WINTER CAROLS is one of the best Christmas cds I have ever heard."
3,Disappointed,"I am a fan of BN, but this disappointed me. I was hoping for more original ballad-y type songs. Too much was familiar."
2,Blackmore the Raider,"This is quite a nice little holiday album, I must say. It would have gotten a five star review, though, if it had the splendid sounds of an electric guitar demolition as a coda to the whole thing."
4,Great - aside from lyric changes,"This album is in regular rotation among my Christmas favorites. My favorite of the tracks is ""Ding Dong Merrily on High"" - a wonderfully energetic arrangement that shows off Candace's voice perfectly. The entire album, though, is worthy of just putting on repeat and letting it play.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the changes made in the lyrics of ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" and ""O Come All Ye Faithful"". Like others have noted, all references to Christ were removed. Religious implications aside, it's jarring to be listening to a familiar carol and hear such a major, pointed change to the lyrics. It seems like it would have made more sense just to choose different songs.Still, though, it's a great album overall. I highly recommend it."
5,Best holiday CD in years,"Once again Richie Blackmore, Candice Night and there band of minsterals have captured the essence of the renaissance period, The song selection, arraingments and pure talent of this band makes for the best holiday CD to come out in years. Queen Elizabeth 1 would have been pleased."
4,"Overall, a nearly perfect CD for Christmas","I won't rehash the earlier reviews because they all perfectly capture the highly enjoyable listening experience of Winter Carols. I recommend it as highly as they do. However, I have one major disappointment with it: ""Wish You Were Here"". Nearly all those purchasing this CD are presumably fans who already have their other works, so they already have WYWH on two of those earlier albums. Likewise, the only connection the song has with winter are a couple of references to snow. In other word, it's a nice song but it's not a carol, doesn't fit with the others, and seems like a effortless toss-in. There are wonderful medieval-flavor carols which they could have put in its place, such as ""Here We Come A-Wassailing"", ""In Dulci Jubilo"", ""Gaudete"" or ""The Boar's Head Carol"", just to name a few. This album is an excellent choice for Christmas. A bit more effort might have made it a classic."
5,Loved it!,"Came across some of this music on You-Tube while searching for Medieval Styled Christmas Music, specifically the Holly and the Ivy! Fell in love with this one.....Richie Blackmore from the old Deep Purple and his Wife Carol Knight. It was great."
2,Flat and boring!,"It is like a travel log, which is simple, flat, and almost colorless in comparison to other relaxing DVDs on the market. It appears to be taken within two hours around the noontime, as the light comes straight down and never changes. You don't see colorful butterflies, exotic flowers and rare animals as expected, but trees and plants like what you may see anywhere in neighborhood woods. This may be relaxing, but definitely not entertaining, like your everyday walk. I showed the DVD to a photographer friend, who happened to like it. He said he liked its simplicity and subtlety. Regardless, it is not too bad to have a walk without going out on a rainy day for $10."
3,For my toy six shooter,Got a ton of rubberbands in this box. They could be a little longer but they work out just fine.
5,They're rubber bands..what more can I say?,I like rubber bands because it gives my hands something to do. It came in a large bag and they're well made. So if you're looking for rubber bands..these are them.
5,HAVE RUBBERBAND--WILL TRAVEL,"WORLD CLASS RUBBERBAND SHOOTER AVAILABLE FOR COMPETITIVE EVENTS. Weapon of choice: Alliance #64.These rubberbands are DEADLY ACCURATE at distances up to 6 feet, MODERATELY ACCURATE at 6 to 7 feet while beyond 7 feet there exists a MODICUM OF ACCURACY.

Test results courtesy of AC Rubberband Shooters Association, 2009.Wire Paladin."
4,New Compilation with 5 new recordings - -,"This is not a reissue of Anne's 1981 Christmas album, as stated by another reviewer, but a new compilation from her entire catalog of Christmas recordings (4 albums) and 4 new recordings - Jingle Bell Rock, Rocking Around The Christmas Tree, Blue Christmas, and Baby It's Cold Outside (with Michael Buble) plus the unreleased Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (with Diana Krall).Her previous Christmas albums are CHRISTMAS WISHES (1981), CHRISTMAS (1988) - both on Capitol; THE SEASON WILL NEVER GROW OLD (1994 - Hallmark), and WHAT A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS (2001 - EMI - new recordings and older Hallmark recordings on 2 CD's). There's also a nice compilation BEST OF THE SEASON (1994 - Capitol) which has every track from her 1981 and 1988 albums plus the song The Season Will Never Grow Old."
2,Hold Up..............What?,"This movie makes the vampire-genre look like a board game. ""Roll the dice and see where your vampire destiny takes you."" is pretty much the moral to this movie. The only reason I'm not rating this junk one star is because it was a pretty brave step to take ""vampire movie"" to this new area, but it was a waste of my and their money and time.Don't look sad, Chile, you have many more chances in the future to try again. For our sake, I hope not..."
1,THE WORST CHILEAN MOVIE...EVER!!!!!......A SHAME FOR CHILE,Well Im from Chile... And this movie here ... its considered: ONE OF THE MOST BAD MOVIES EVER!!... The script its really stupid and bad.... whit awful conexions... spx are a very shame thing in the movie. maybe the soundtrack (original song singin by Lucibell) its good .... The Unic good director on chile its... andres wood... but jorge really stinks.... You suffer of Imsomnia?... You Want sleep? So.... WAtch ETERNAL MOVIE... Its so its so boring.... Me and my friend are get out of the cinema on the middle of the movie.... You Have to see JU OON.... the grude... original japanase... if you wanna scare.......
3,"Well, what were you expecting?","Some people may not like this movie, but aside from Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula of the 30s, no vampire movie has ever exactly been considered Oscar material. Sangre Eterna is no exception. However, it does manage to keep you entertained, which is what a movie is supposed to do. Right? It may be low budget, but it is a good combination of gore, mild suspense, and a fairly good mystery. The only thing I could think of that would make people not like this movie is that it's in Spanish and it might be confusing if you can't understand the language, but I'm pretty sure that the DVD comes with the English dolby option so there really shouldn't be any problem."
3,First Chilean Vampire Movie !!!,"A good effort was given to shoot this movie. In a place were local horror film makers do not exist (Chile), it's good to see that some people take time and money to develop an area that is not quite explored in this part of the world... The movie itself: A Journalism student called Carmilla is attracted to a guy (called just ""M"") and starts playing a Role Play Game called ""Eternal Blood"" were they play vampiric characters along with other friends. Soon ""M"" discovers that some of the guys he knows are acting strange and starts to fear that perhaps the game is more real than he ever thought...Good make-up, excellent opening credit sequence (the best part of the movie, some say), perhaps a little bad acting from some minor characters (kind of El Mariachi...). But A LOT BETTER than those old vampire flicks from Jess Franco.I recommend it only to extreme Horror & Vampire fans anyway."
3,Vampirisum Is No Game.,"Ok this is a cool flick but I must say I was thrown off by the roll playing game deal.I always thought nerds and geeks played roll games like D&D;, maybe I am wrong.The movie has some stuff in it that is pretty original and the screener I saw was balls to the wall blood and guts, not yet rated. I hope they did not chop it up to bad for the ""R"" rating.You should see this film if you like the blood suckers, forget the party poopers who were cutting this movie apart, it's worth your time."
3,Well...,"I admit when I first watched this movie years ago...I thought it was horrible just horrible. The only good part was see the ""lead"" girl naked. I quote lead cause about a third of the way through the focus shifts from her as the main character to one of the males. All that was before I got more interested into plot development and mythology. As years went by and I thought about it, its not a bad movie. While the twist at the end has been done before in some ways it still works. Plus there is an interesting theory used for why violence was used in the Inquisition and medieval trials. Its differently worth checking out."
5,GANGSTAAAAAA,"Juvey's da man, man. Hes got dat ill south flow, great lyrics and da freshest productionz from Mannie Fresh. This Song is off da hook. JUVEY IZ DA DON...Better cop this tri-zzack..."
3,utterly bizarre,"I read this book in the original French (Contes pour buveurs attardes) a few years back when I was researching Michel Tremblay, one of French Canada's best and best known writers. He's written novels, short stories, plays... all of which are more than worthy of the Canadian literary canon.I've heard he was only 19 when he wrote this collection of short stories, and they certainly are different from the works he's better known for. Bizarre is the only word to describe them. Some are written in a fantasy vein, some are comedic, some lean towards horror, some are satirical, while others make no sense at all and defy classification. They are, indeed, the sort of stories a late-night drinker would imagine and enjoy.Definitely worth a read if you're a short story junkie or have a taste for the bizarre."
5,verry good book,"this book is exiting for all ages it is a book that you can't put it down. It is very gripping and a book to remember. It has a verry good and exiting story which ,by being about hypnotism also is quite mysterious.Molly is an orphan who lives in Beversvile orphanage. She and her best freind rocky found themselves learning hypnoism from an old book that molly found in beversvile library written by ""Dr.H.Logan"".molly goes to america and becomes a star using her hypnotism sckills to get all the people to think she is wonderfull.......altogether it is a grate book and i would recomend it to anyone!!!"
5,Molly Moons incredible book of hypnotism Rocks!,"This is a delightful book for people of all ages. Molly is a lonely orphan looking for a better life. She has but one friend, Rocky Scarlet. She is having the worst time of her life until she finds a book of hypnotism and everything changes! When I read this book for school, I started out thinking, ""Oh no, another book!"", but after the first chapter, I was hooked! Normal books about people's life are just too boring. This book has just the right amount of twists! It keeps you thinking and I got so into it, that one day I read for 3 hours straight! The ending to this book is so unexpecting! It was by far the best book I have ever read!"
5,molly moon,"my teacher read this book to the class but never finished it. I enjoyed it so much that i went out and bought it that arfternoon. Molly is an orphan who lives in Hardwick House. The lady who owns it is very mean and molly's only friend is Rocky, and nearly everyone else is really mean to her. But when Molly finds a book on hypnotisim, her luck begins to change.I loved this book and I bought the 2nd one to, which had even more fabulous twists than the first. Read this Book!!!"
2,Um.,"It was an interesting plot idea. But what I really didn't like about this story was the characters. I didn't like Molly or Rocky at all, probably because Georgia Byng provided so little description and insight about them. I was bored with it. At the end of the story, it seemed like I didn't know any more about the characters than I did when I first picked it up. I haven't touched it since I finished it. Don't want to read it again, ever."
5,The Wonderful Review by Evey,This is a wonderful book for anyone to read! At night i would usually get in trouble for staying up to late reading Molly Moon's Incredible Book Of Hypnotism. As i read this book i felt like i was really there going on all the adventures with Molly. I would reccomend this book to anyone that is ready to read one of the best books in their life!-Evey
5,Amazing Book,I really enjoyed this book. I think others will too. I cant wait to see what happens in the third Molly Moons!
3,more for teenage readers,Interesting story and characters. Story a bit simplistic but enjoyable nevertheless. I would recommend this as a light summer read.
5,An amazing adventure!,I was browsing around the bookstore and found the book. The front cover was so flashy and unique. I just had to get it. The title was right. It was truly was an incredible book! It had so many interesting twists and turns! I am going to try to find more Molly moon books.
4,Molly Moon's Book of Hypnotism,"In a Roald Dahl type novel, orphan Molly Moon discovers that she has the ability to hypnotize people, and it starts a fantastic adventure, including a chocolate-cookie-eating-pug, a villian with a scorpian medallion, and more! This is not a quick read, considering it has over 300 pages, but it will keep you hooked to the last sentence. I dropped one star because the book has some confusing plot twists, which make it interesting, but harder to follow."
5,Who is not interested in hypnotising???,"Wow. After I read this book I felt as if I was hypnotised myself because it is SO good!!!!!!!!!!! So that explains that this book is about hypnotising. Molly Moon is an orphan living in an orphanage with a REALLY mean owner, when suddenly she decides to go to a library to see some books. Molly finds a book that teaches people how to hypnotise others. What trouble does she get into? Read to find out!!!"
2,revenge-theft and some really mean actions,"Molly gains great power after finding a book on hypnotism. Rather than doing good for everyone- she becomes quite selfish and really hurts some others. Although she redeems herself a bit in the end, there are no bad consequences for her selfish behavior. I think that the premise was interesting and the story was written reasonably well- prefer Charlie Bone books to this..."
4,Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism,"Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism is about an orphan named Molly. She reads a book about hypnotism and realizes she has an amazing gift. Molly does not know it but an evil stranger is planning to steal her book. Will Molly escape his trap or, will her book be gone forever?"
5,The Best Book EVER!!,"This is the best book! It is soo cool and funny @ thesame time. Some of my friends don't like it, but I loveit ! It is so good that I rated all the stars. If there wasmore I'd put 100 stars. This is a great book :)-Antonieta 6th"
4,Molly Moon's Incredible Book Of Hypnotism,"Molly Moon's Incredible Book Of Hypnotism is a wonderful book. Molly Moon, an orphan in a horrible orphanage, finds a book on hypnotism. Molly goes from being a nobody that everybody hates, to being the most popular person in New York City. But somebody is following her, and wants to steal the amazing book on hypnotism to take over the world! The themes of the book are friendship and loneliness, and good and evil. Georgia Byng is a wonderful writer, and has also written a sequel 'Molly Moon Stops The World.'"
4,Pinkpanther's* grrrrreat review,"I enjoyed this book very much. Here's why: Molly Moon turns from a down-in-the-dumps orphan to a super star everyone's craving to hear about.It's kind of weird how she turns from a penniless orphan to a billionaire, but I shouldn't say how. Soon, a crazy madman is hot on Molly's trail, trying to take advantage of Molly's secret.When Molly's adorable pet Petula the pug gets stolen and Molly is blackmailed to rob a bank that holds precious jewels, It's up to Molly to 'save the day'.But she doesn't realize some secrets her best friend, Rocky, is keeping from her.The not so good part about this book was the way the book ended. It was as if this book was written as a joke. But don't worry, everything in between if fantastic."
3,361 Best colleges,Not nearly as in depth as I expected. I will depend on US News or Time from now own.
3,Finding the Art,"Sure, Beanie, is a bit of a con man, but he stumbled into some real creativity. Unfortunately, he was so obsessed with making his horror movie and involving the documentary film maker that he missed that his vids of the locals was itself good film - more pure and interesting than his ultimate horror film--and some of the stronger parts of Mule Skinner Blues."
2,Where is Koos?,"I wish that there had been more photos of Koos work! The author gives very good instruction for doing applique, making bindings etc. However, in all, the book is disappointing if one is looking for inspiration and examples of the magical fabric combinations that made Koos's tradmark. Far too few examples of Koos's couture collage. I would not have bought the book if I'd read the reviews. Too bad!"
5,East coast hardcore,"this is one of the best hardcore cds to come out in recent memory, terror is one of the best bands to emerge in the hardcore scene and they are destined to be remembered. the difference between a band like them and agnostic front or sick of it all, is publicity and time. if you like hardcore you will love this cd it's fast paced heavy it has heavy break downs and lyrics that are tough as nails. definitely worth buying."
4,"DVD ""R"" Rated--much better on Masterpiece Theater","As someone who was mesmerized by this trilogy when it appeared on Masterpiece Theater, I was surprised that the DVD was needlessly made into an ""R"" rated version. Frontal nudity (women), back nudity (men) and simulated sexual intercourse on the DVD version in no way enhanced the triology. I found myself embarrassed for the superb actor, Sir Ian Richardson, having to simulate explicit sex with actresses the age of his grandchildren. Do directors really think the audience cannot imagine sexual affairs without having to see simulated intercourse or simulated oral sex between the actors in the movie? To me it's bait and switch--you view a production on T.V. and are not told that what you are buying on DVD is not the same but has added content which you had not wished to see. Without the nudity and simulated sex I would have rated the trilogy *****."
5,"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow","BBC's HOUSE OF CARDS trilogy is one of the finest min-series ever produced for television. From the engaging story to the truly memorable acting of Ian Richardson and a superb cast of supporting actors, everything is first rate.The evil, Machiavellian British Prime Minister at the heart of the story is no different than the dastardly characters in Shakespeare as well as some of the most insidious politicos around today in any country. One of the chapters is called TO PLAY THE KING. Indeed, how many of us have been played by Francis Urquharts all around the world. A brilliant, engrossing tale and a cautionary one as well. Brilliant."
2,unhappy with order,"I was disappointed in this order because it was not clear enough that this DVD will NOT PLAY in the USA. I tried to get the info on it BEFORE itwas shipped, but was unable to do so...although both Movie Mars AND Amazon each responded to my emails. Just not soon enough to stop shipment which was OBVIOUS to EACH OF THEM that it would be useless to me. I had to return the DVD and am awaiting credit..minus the return mailing charge. I will continue to order from Amazon, and have given Movie Mars another chance and have ordered another DVD from them. Everything would have been GREAT if I had been able to watch the DVD............"
3,closed captions do not work,"I am not able to have an opinion since the closed captions did not work. The strong British accents made it very difficult to understand the dialog without the closed captions. When i odered this set, the fact that closed captions were specified was an important factor. Can you suggest a solution? If not, I would like to request your authorization to return them for credit."
5,Great Entertainment,"These stories are well written,well acted and produced. Everyone involved is a professional of the highest calibre. There is great suspense and surprise but not suited for younger audiences. I'd say over 17-18."
4,Huzza!,"All the way through. The concept and execution are unique, yet classic, and the lead performance is, truly, a masterpiece of arch, urbane villainy. Francis Urquart seems thoroughly steeped in the Shakesperian tradition of evil-doers. I just found this set unopened at at sidewalk sale in my neighborhood for $5. It's worth 10 times that in sheer entertainment value."
5,House Of Cards Ian Richardson,We could hardly wait to recieve this Video set.We rented the first one from the Wallingford library and it had to be collected from a different library. It is a wonderful offering.Sharon Cioffi
5,Treachery and deviousness at its best!,"This trilogy lives up to the many awards it has garnered. Ian Richardson is wonderful as Francis Urquhart--a first rate politician and evil manipulator, but one for whom you tend to root, nonetheless. Both myself and my husband thoroughly enjoyed this series and were captivated from the very first episode. I highly recommend this set for anyone who loves a bit of ruthless treachery, high-stakes political savvy, a bit of mystery and, of course, murder!"
5,yikes,ian richardson is blood-chilling and the actress who plays his wife is even worse/better. this is a look at the workings of politics the world around...fabulous.
5,House of Cards Trilogy,"Terrific acting with a great, great script. If you liked the way ""The West Wing"" looked at how government works from the inside, you may love this very different, very British story of the machinations of power."
3,You get what you pay for,I ordered the collet for my Craftsman router (same part number) and have not used it yet but can see from visual inspection it is not nearly as robust as the original part.
3,Speak Spanish?,I have 3 kids who simply love LeapFrog products. The problem is that we live in Mexico so we need to have the choice of language selection in these products.
3,"LeapFrog, please skip the cards with future books!!","This LeapPad book looks great, and I almost bought it for my four-year-old twins. Why didn't I? Because it comes with 15 cards that are used interactively with the book. My kids love colorful cards like these, but are amazingly quick to lose or ruin them. I'm sure that the book wouldn't be as much fun without the cards. (LeapFrog, if you're reading this, please don't include small/fragile items like cards with future books!)"
5,A remarkable violinist,Leonid Kogan was a true master of the violin. This dvd is a top rate collector's item. Kogan's cadenza in Beethoven's violin concerto was very original and dynamic ...I think the best one I've ever heard.
4,"Beautiful product, sharp edge","These were an anniversary gift for a Waterford collector. He loved them since they looked coordinated and classy on his bar. But I feel the edge is a bit thin/sharp when drinking. I also feel a bit odd when drinking a $10 bottle of wine out of a $25 glass! Despite that one negative, these are very lovely."
4,Beautiful but Big,"Waterford makes beautiful crystal, and these wine glasses are no exception. I like drinking red wines from a stemless glass; however, the circumference of these is difficult to put your hand around if you have a small female hand. I have served from these glasses to some of my girlfriends, and they have to use two hands to pick them up. Personally, I like them because I have a bigger hand, but don't get them if the size may be an issue. They look beautiful sitting on the bar though."
2,Portable Crafter,"I liked the patterns in this book for the baby sweaters and baby hat so purchased it only to find out that all three of the baby sweater patterns have mistakes in the directions. It is very frustrating to start a project and then find that you have to struggle to understand the instructions. In fact, it is more like part of the instructions are missing for all of these patterns. I would not suggest this book if the projects that you wish to knit from it are any of the baby sweaters. The baby hat is a very easy patterns and turns out very cute. But a book is hardly worth purchasing when one of the five patterns that you like can be knitted easily."
4,Handy To Have,"If you're a knitter that's on the ""go"" a lot, this is a convenient, pocket-sized book to have with you. It has a lot of nice, smaller projects to make, that would be very portable without taking up a lot of space or dragging a lot of extra paraphenalia around with you. I would have liked to see a little more variety for the projects, however."
5,It's good one,"I purchased the conditioner from Compusa. It costs me $125 including tax and shipping. I have been using the product for two weeks. I never heard any click sound when it corrects power fault. All powerer, TV cable, and telephone are connected the conditioner. All seems working very well except a telephone line for sattllite receiver. It works for a while, then sattllite asks me to re-connect the telephone line, otherwise monthly fees will be occurred ,so I must re-set it time to time."
2,It's no better than a regular stapler,"For nearly triple the price of a translucent green, cheap store stapler I bought in 1998, I expected this stapler to offer me minimal effort to punch through at least 15 pages, and also securely fasten at the end. I was deeply disappointed.Firstly, the picture is not an accurate representation of the color of this stapler, it's more fuchsia/purple than it is deep purple.Next, using regular office staples, the stapler got a jam--gathering 2-3 staples at a time--every 10 or so staple punches I did, so I had to open it each time and remove the jam.The final factor was that the effort to punch staples was almost double that of a regular stapler! You also cannot stand it up on its edge, which is a natural way to pick up staplers nowadays. It also does not have the ability to staple with the bottom lip down, so that you can punch onto a bulletin board, for example.Buy a different brand is my recommendation."
1,"GARBAGE, DO NOT BUY!!!!","YOU WOULD THINK FOR THE PRICE IT WOULD LAST. I USED IT ALMOST EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST 1-1/2 YEARS AND IT JUST STOPPED WORKING. I AM TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK, BUT I WILL NOT BUY THIS ONE AGAIN!!!!!"
4,Great stapler,I have always used swingline staplers in the past. They have been great except for use at my current job where I need to staple various numbers of sheets at a time. Sometimes 15 or 20 and the stapler would always jam with the thick sheets. This stapler goes through the papers with ease. Everyone at work wants to use my stapler. It actually makes stapling fun! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it has been dropped on the floor a couple of times and it takes some putting back together. The metal plate on the bottom has to be put back together and it is not as easy as regular staples to load the staples. I definitely recommend this stapler for people who need to staple any where from 2-25 sheets of paper. By the way even if you are just stapling 2 sheets together it does not tear or rip the paper. I have heard is a problem with electric staplers.
5,Hands down the BEST stapler I have ever used,"I like many people work in an office and I staple a lot of papers throughout my day. I used to use my trusty Swingline stapler (just like in Office Space) but found that if I stapled more than 7-8 sheets of paper together, the stapler would jam or not push the staple all the way through. I started to do some research and came upon the PaperPro and decided to try it. Wow, I was amazed that it really is 1 finger stapling through up to 25 sheets of paper! I know you shouldn't get this excited about a stapler but the ease with which it sends staples through the paper is quite amazing. I actually like stapling papers together now! I liked it so much at work that I bought one for home also. If you are looking for a new stapler, this one is well worth the price. I have had mine for over a year and it still works good as new. It also takes standard staples if you were worried about that!"
5,The Best stapler you will ever own!!,"I have purchased four of these now.....as our old staplers go bad in our office I replace them with the PaperPro Prodigy. They are a heavy stapler, with a very good quality feel. This stapler will not ""wear"" you out because it has a mechanism that allows you to staple with as little pressure as your pinky can use and yet it goes thru 20 pages easily. It's a must in our business!!"
3,It staples papers,"Sure it is fun to use, with the cool ""click"" it gives you as it shoots through the paper, but it is just another stapler. All desk staplers go through 25 sheets, regular staples are too short for any more pages.The reason I give it only 3 stars is because I staple a lot of things with just 2 pages and this stapler will actually shoot the entire staple through both sheets. That might be all and good if you are Tim Taylor and need more power, or if you are using it for 10+ pages all the time, but it is not always efficient with just 2 or 3 pages."
5,It works!,"This wonderful stapler has worked flawlessly. I have used it for about a week, but it appears to be well made, and I am optimistic that it will continue to work well. I frequently staple 10 to 20 sheets at a time. This stapler works effortlessly, and I tested it on 25 pages of standard copier paper, and it performed as well as it would on 2 sheets of paper. No more wadded-up staples! Worth every penny! In addition, the base of the stapler is shaped so that you can easily hold it in your hand and staple papers held in your other hand."
5,Best Stapler Ever,"This thing is the best. Can't say enough good stuff about it. Buy one already. You wouldn't think such a simple thing could improve your day as much as it does. Satisfying on all levels. Closes staples completely even on 2-3 sheet clips. Does not over close, no protrusion through the front of your paper."
5,Stapler,Awesome stapler gets the job done . The second one I have purchased now and would buy again. Just awesome
5,Stapler review,"I received my product quickly and really, ahead of time! The product is the color I saw and received. I was really more amazed with the product than expected. I have had so many of the ""standard"" staplers that I have to ""pull together"" (The 2 sides) or ""slam"" my fist down on it to get through the few papers I have. This stapler does just what it says it does: Push down with one finger and it staples up to 25 papers! No stuck staples. No difficulty. I don't have to worry about getting out a staple puller ""again"" and working on stapling for 10 minutes! This stapler is AWESOME! I take my hat off to the seller for selling a GREAT product. Thanks!"
5,Effortless Stapler,"I've owned this 1110 Prodigy stapler for a couple of months now and was reluctant as to how well this stapler would actually perform. I'm hesitant to leave a review right after a purchase which is why I waited til now to do so. So far it has exceeded my expectations and have given it a 5 star rating. It has held up well and extremely easy to use. Although it says the capacity is 25 sheets, I've used it on up to 30 sheets. The only problem with using it on 30 sheets is the staple just will make it all the way through, but it WILL. I've had no problems with it and seems to be holding up well. IMO, it's well worth the money.Here is a link for your convenience to read more about it. I'm doing this on my own, not persuaded by the seller.[...]"
1,Quit working after 3/4 of a strip of staples.,"The PaperPro Prodigy Stapler (118)'s patented staple driving mechanism, that will drive a standard staple through up to 25 sheets of paper with one finger, was amazing to use, but quit working after 3/4 of a strip of staples. This was not a simple staple jam -- the internal mechanism broke!I never thought a person could get so excited about a stapler. The reviews sold it, and using it at home, stapling slicky sales papers for a bird, sealed my opinion.I was impressed with how easy it stapled. But now I'm faced with the hassle of returning it. Bummer."
1,Worked great for two days -- then didn't. Have returned.,"I was pleased with this stapler for two days, when it suddenly no longer worked. I looked through the manual looking for troubleshooting ideas. Gave up and returned it."
5,Love this stapler!,I honestly can't say anything bad about this stapler. The price was great and it works exactly like I thought it would. I am still a little in awe of how one finger can put a staple through a stack of papers! I will never go back to using conventional staplers again.
4,High performance and high decibels,"I bought three of these. One for myself and two as gifts. They function very well, and the ease of stapling larger sets of papers is remarkable, but as at least one other reviewer noted, when the stapler strikes, it is LOUD. If I have it too close to my face, it actually sets my ears to ringing. Obviously, I have taken to holding it at arm's length. I should say that one of the people I gave this to loves it without reservation."
5,Awesome!!,"I bought this when it first came out in 1989 on tape, and it's one of the few I've not yet gotten on CD. She's awesome, and it's different from her earlier stuff, but just as good."
2,I found this book disappointing.,"This book is subtitled ""A layman's introduction to the herbal world"". I found it to be anything but; it is definitely not written toward the layman or as an introduction. Something else I found frustrating was the authors constant reference to a numbering system that is meaningless to the reader, for example, when mentioning Salt Water Blue-green Algae, the numbers ""(1-2500) follow. Nowhere is this numbering system explained."
1,No need! Ear bud included in V300 box,"First, the Ear bud is included free with the phone. Second, I got the car charger for $5 at Sam's Club. Third, the phone is too big, compared to others in it's class to have a leather case. Besides, the blue is cool so why hid it."
1,Don't Bother Buying...,"The Head gear is of very poor quality, the car charger fried my phone and the leather case is ok but very hard to use when trying to take a picture..."
3,Problems with the Hands Free Earbud,"The manufacturer indicated that the hands free earbud was ""compatible with Motorola V300"". This claim did not prove to be true. The earbud does not work properly with my phone - which is a Motorola V300.The car charger and the leather carrying case are fine."
2,Poor Design...,You cannot take pictures when the leather cover is on. The cover also blocks the charger plug; you cannot plug the phone to the charger when the cover is on. Taking off the cover is not easy either ...
3,Car Charger,I bought this and mainly bought it for the car charger. The hands free headset is horrible it buzzes and the carrying case is nice but is too small for my phone. I reccomend this if all you want to use is the Car Charger
4,Good Kit,"For the price is an excellent one, however the only ""con"" it's that the belt clip is not turnable."
4,Excellent bootstrap..,"Though dated (the book covers Mathematica 3), I found this book very helpful in getting started with Mathematica 4.1. Half an hour with this book will make using Mathematica a joy and save many frustrations that beginner users who just 'jump' into the program often encounter.While I had no complaints with the text and contents. I think I'd have just felt better if the cover said ""Covers Mathematica 4.1""!"
1,***Not the product others are reviewing***,"I am giving a one star review for this as a warning to buyers rather than a condemnation of the product, which may very well be of high quality. The glowing reviews you see here are not by people who bought this book on Amazon. This is NOT the textbook they are all raving about. It is the associated STUDY GUIDE. It is 250 pages and contains absolutely NO RECIPES OR INSTRUCTIONS. It is the ""homework book"" that is supposed to be used with the textbook. It is WORTHLESS without that textbook. I made the purchase of this book based on the reviews, don't make the same mistake I did."
5,very good book,"Great source of information for any cook from the beginner to the expert, includes many recipes that are basic to cooking"
5,The Book I Used In Culinary School,"This book is great for someone who is just starting to get serious in the kitchen. It teaches you so much, from cutting styles to cuts of meat to how to store food properly and the proper way to build a sandwich. This is the book we used when I was a culinary student years ago, the exact edition and I was so happy to find it on Amazon for hundreds of dollars cheaper than it was being offered when this was a brand new edition.Anyone trying to sharpen their skills or the home cook who wants to do a little more, GET THIS BOOK!"
5,Comprehensive,"As a culinary professional, this book will walk anyone- of any skill level- through the basics of the culinary world. If you are trying to understand the basics and attempting to grasp why you use certain skills; this is the ideal book for you. I have used this text for nearly a decade and it still is comprehensive. A word of warning however, some of the recipes are not the most accurate! The country biscuits recipe calls for far too much salt (although it doesn't seem it)."
4,Reaching back (the flip sides),"It was pure joy being able to listen to; ""The last one to be loved"" or ""It's love that really counts"", without the familiartics and hiss from the original albums. In the early 60's, Dionnes music was a breath of fresh air. Only her voice and Burt and Hal's music and lyrics could take us there. Romantic soul...is however...no more. They almost pulled it off one more time with an album called 'DIONNE', Warner Bros BS2585, long out of print and not available in CD form. For DW fans, don't miss this one."
3,Beautiful but cold,"I only knew a few of the arias from this opera before listening to this recording. While the singing here is beautiful, I was left in the cold by the lack of emotion shown by many of the singers. Ever heard Kasarova sing ""Venga pur""? There's nothing to match that in this recording."
3,Could be better,"Not as educational as I'd hoped. My kids liked it alright though. My daughter is learning how to read and it didn't really teach her much. OK for entertainment, but not if you want to teach your child to read. Not as good as some of the CD ROM's."
4,Great kids entertainment,"My daughter is in love with Max and Ruby, and I have to admit that I like it too. Unlike much of children's programming, it's not overly preachy, forcefully educational or whining/loud/obnoxious. Instead, Max and Ruby are a refreshing loving pair of siblings dealing with their daily games and activities and interacting with one another and working through disagreements. Max has some amazing toys and Ruby has a great imagination. The Bunny Tales DVD is specifically fun, with fairy tales retold featuring Max and Ruby and some unexpected twists. Great DVD for airplane, car or everyday home watching."
5,MONK and TRANE,"First I'd like to preface that I am not a musician or Jazz expert, but a Jazz enthusiast. I was a little leary about purchasing this CD because of the bad review and all the outtakes on the discography, but the price was right.If you get this CD you'll be pleasantly surprised at the audio and musical quality of the songs and alternate takes. The little booklet inside was informative without being verbose.Highly recommended!"
2,Should Not Be Left to Stand Alone,"This music should be bonus tracks on discs like Carnegie Hall. And no, I don't need five versions of Crepuscule with Nellie."
2,Eh....,"I was really excited when i saw that this two disk cd was only 3.99. Unfortunately i learned that it was 3.99 because it wasn't that great. If you are a Jazz CD Collector then you should get it for collecting purposes but If you want a really good Monk Album get Monk's Dream, Thelonious in Action, or Solo Monk. Actually just get Essential Monk which has all his great composed standards. This CD just made me appreciate the time Monk had with Charlie Rouse and Johnny Griffin. The 5 versions of Crepuscule With Nellie don't Compare to the verision Monk does with Rouse. But it's cheap and it's not terrible."
2,Not first rate tracks,"A bit disappointing. Not first rate tracks, these were more practice sessions or jam sessions. Maybe relevant to the enthusiast who wants it all, but definitely NOT for the casual jazz afficionado who wants only the best examples of polished works for his enjoyment."
3,Not a Very Good Case,"Product looks the same as shown in the picture. However, it is made from hard plastic of not very high quality. The case actually consists of two pieces. You will have to put your phone in and then put the two pieces together using the plastic latches at the edge of the case. The latches are so brittle and one of mine broke on the first try. Furthermore, the workmanship of the case is not so good either, and one of my friends who bought the same case found a big scratch on the screen cover."
1,Didn't work out for me,"This case fits the phone great, but it traps dirt. Dirt that pitted my screen, and after having it for 3 weeks it is cracking in 2 places. Very dissapointed."
1,Nice Idea is all,The quality sucks I bought 3 of them at one time and I am on my last one of the three and I have only had them for a mo. They always break in the lower left hand side. Great idea plastic sucks
1,Bad Product,"Like other reviews, the latches located on the side broke off within a week. Then the case eventually got this crack along the front side. I wish thise case was as durable as the iclear case for ipod nano, but it isn't. I would of been better off taping the entire phone with with clear packaging tape to protect it."
2,Sjoberg 995-5400 Aluminum Jaw -SMALL-SMALL-SMALL,"When I saw these Aluminum Jaw Protectors for the Sjoberg wood bench I was happy that there was a product to protect the wooden jaws when clamping certain material. Boy was I surprised when these very small aluminum right-angle plates showed up. They are only 1 + 1/8"" deep by about 4 + 5/8"" long. They do not provide any real protection for the large wooden vises that come with the Sjoberg bench. I wish they would have included the size in the description. Caveat Emptor."
5,WONDERFUL!,"This book is great! It is full of knowledge and is written in a fun, easy-to-read style! I have had classes with the author. Dr. Jackson writes just as he speaks. A must have for any Alabamian."
5,I love these!,"I love the Rockin Roll bar, and I can't find it at any retail store near me. They taste great but aren't loaded with sugar like a lot of protein products. This is a great price and a great way to supplement my diet and boost my workouts."
4,Out on The Range,"James Lee Stanley's 1997 was probably overshadowed by an official movie version of the book he based the album on, Tom Robbins' ""Even Cowgirls Get The Blues."" The official movie soundtrack was filled with KD Lang songs and Uma Thurman's pictures. But Stanley had one up; Robbins' co-wrote the title song on James Lee's disc. While the movie soundtrack may have been the music for the motion picture, James has written a soundtrack for the novel. Music for the theater in your mind.Each of the songs is supposed to be inspired by the book's characters, including a cover of ""I Only Have Eyes for You."" The CD has more of a folk/country feel than the soundtrack, which bounced from the rodeo to the electronic disco. Stanley's disc has a more romantic heart, you can fall in love with the music as you would fall in love with the book. The disc works as a literary whole. Like many of James Lee Stanley's albums, the emotional core of the music makes it worthy of repeated listens."
1,burned out in 2 seconds,"don't buy this item!i bought two and the same result after i plug itto my hp pc,burned out in two 2222222222222 seconds!"
1,Don't take the risk,"I bought this even after reading all the negative reviews on it thinking that it was worth the risk for the price; that was a mistake.It worked great for a week until all of the sudden it wouldn't. Months later after it quit on me it still has a somewhat pleasant burning aroma to it. If you like that smell I would recommend that you buy a candle instead, it's much cheaper.Please don't take the risk of buying this."
4,Super G USB adapter-Trendnet,TRENDnet 108Mbps Wireless Super G USB Adapter (TEW-444UB Version V1.1R)It is quite capable and speed is usually the same as fast ethernet. On rare occasions it needs a re-boot to connect; overall the same capability as my laptop.Almita Ranstrom
1,Buy a brand name,I bought two of these and could only ever to get one to work right. My replacement brand name ones work great. I would not but these again.
2,keeps loosing the network,"i bought this to use in my newly upgraded desktop with windows vista. it CONTINUALLY drops the wireless signal (at least every hour) - when you click to connect to a network it does not find any networks. pulling it out and pushing it back in seems to recover the network almost every time, but this is really annoying to have to do repeatedly. it is not a signal strength issue in general, as another desktop in the same room and two laptops that frequent the room have no trouble getting good signals."
1,Please don't buy this adapter.,"For the sake of your sanity and the peacefulness of you neighborhood, please don't bother buying this adapter. It may lead to uncontrollable bouts of screaming. I have another computer which picks up our wireless signal fine, but with this adapter the signal is frequently dropped. Unplugging and plugging it back in usually gets it online again for at least a few minutes, but it's a big pain in the neck. Having to do this repeatedly meant keeping it plugged into the front of the computer within reach, which meant that it got knocked into frequently because it sticks out a good 3"" from the computer. Now it has come apart and has to be replaced. Piece of cr@p."
1,It's not great as I'd hoped,It does not work well on Win Vista and quite slow on Win Xp. Hard to to install.
1,Trendnet Wireless G USB,"Bought with high expectations due to its great spec. First one didn't work, sent back. Second also didn't work, and returned. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Wireless adapter,"Well, it is a good product for most of the old laptops, but it drains alot of energy for some laptop computers."
1,"Piece of ""Old"" Junk","Ok ... here's the deal on this product. It sucks for newer machines do not even bother buying it and is ""experimental"" at best with old ones. It craps out because it can't handle the power exchange from the computer into the USB2.0, and what I noticed is that it uses old encryptions. I know it's cheap, but don't let that lure you, go for something newer, I have lynksys as my router, I plugged this into the computer twice and it died."
1,Junk,"This item was very easy to set up, worked fast, and came with a very nice USB extension cord. Unfortunately, it only worked once. After that no computer I plugged it into recognized anything there, it was totally dead. Trendnets' warranty policy is that the defective unit must be shipped to them at the customers expense, which will cost about half of the units price. Turns out it not as cheap as itt looks. Save your money and buy a better product."
1,Short Life,"This item is not worth the cost of shipping. Let alone the price of the product.I ordered one as a Deal of the Day for about $8. The first one died after one successful use. Amazon customer service was wonderful, cross shipping me a replacement in no time at all.The second one lasted about three weeks before it died.It worked like a champ when it worked, but it's not worth the effort to try for a third.I would stay away from this product if I were you."
4,Good but at good price.,"I had a trendnet adapter that was stolen when my home was broken into, I still had the Trendnet router and wanted to stay with the same brand but couldn't find a store near me that sold Trendnet, original store that I purchased from went out of business. So I came to Amazon and got a replacement for less than what I paid for the original. It does what I need it to do. No complaints."
3,TV Wall Mount,This wall mount is OK. Be careful to make sure this mount will hold the weight of your TV. This mount has a 165 pound limit.
4,Gets the job done,Rather difficult to put up. You will need a second person because it is very head. I would recommend for those who are trying to save money on big purchases. It gets the job done. Seems sturdy so long that you find studs. No reason not to put a little effort into it and save some money.
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"very straight foward. this unit works as advertised. it only gets 4 stars because one of the ""e"" clips(38cents for 2) was broke. not something i'm going to complain about though. i bought mine from 47th Street Photo for $110. very much worth the price."
3,Out of Stock,"I ordered from costlane a couple of days ago because they would give me free expedited shipping but then I got an email saying they were out of stock, I would have to wait 3 weeks, but then i get expedited shipping so it will only take a month to get it. Even though they are still selling them today they don't have them in stock. But they raised the price so maybe if you pay 125 bucks they will be in stock for you.Edit: This review was not the one for the silver mount for 199 bucks some how my review got moved from the original item to this one. LOL If only there was a place i could get this mount for a monoprice I would order it today."
4,Good item for price,"Very nice item for the price. Instructions are minimal, but the mount is built and designed well. Holds our Sony 40"" Bravia well. It will take at least two people to hang... and it helps for one to have some ""handy-man"" experience since instructions are.. not extensive, nor specific to that model.One mistake we made is the center of the wall mount is NOT the center of where the TV sits. So measure accurately to take the off-set into account."
2,Heads up,Solid construction but doesn't stay straight when extended. TV tilts as you extend from flush. I had to build in a tilt to compenstae when mounted and still not enough.
2,"Not very sturdy for 52"" plasma","We purchased this wall mount for our 52"" flat screen. The product specifications state it can hold up to a 60"" tv. We double-checked the manual to make sure it was installed properly, but the wall mount isn't very sturdy. It holds the tv up, but even during installation we were very nervous to leave the wall mount to hold the tv on its own. We definitely will NOT use the articulating arm!"
4,Good enough...,"This is a good item, but only when you consider the price. In the words of the professional who did the installation, ""it sort of throws your TV around,"" which is true. The mount has a tendency to swing forward a few inches unless you click the articulating arm all the way back into the wall mount plate; to do so takes a spirited push.I probably wouldn't feel comfortable moving my 46"" LCD around all day on this mount. It is perfectly adequate, however, the couple of times a week I use it to make the TV visible from the kitchen table.Distance from the wall is not too bad either. All in all a good product for the price."
1,Missing part,The carrier looked great unfortunately I had to return it because the carrier did not have a handle. I opted not to order again.
1,dimensions?,It would be nice to know the specs--I want to use it within a rustic container. The size should always be included.
3,Looks great but handle needs improvement,This looks great and it was just what I wanted but the handle is connected with two holes on each side that it snaps into. It tends to come out- so when you go to pick it up there could be a problem. You have to make sure it's connected tightly.
5,"Excellent quality and design, utility and looks","I am extremely pleased with this product. I brought mine to work and keep it at the end of my long desk.. I keep some flatware in it and a few utensils that my coworkers can borrow. It's very pretty. Now people can see what they are reaching for. I believe the listed retail price is accurate. Nice acrylic is usually costly. It has 2 screws that need to be attached to hold the handle in place; easy to do, and the hardware is attractive and high quality."
4,This Album Takes You Back...Kyle West Break It Down,"As far as I know this was the only album put out by ""The Gyrlz"". They came out around the time Al B. Sure was big and Kyle West was the producer to have at the moment. The most popular tracks were ""Jam Jam (If You Can)"" and ""If It's Games You're Playing"". There are only 9 songs on here which is short by today's standards because now artists just put filler junk songs, skits, or interludes on their album. This is a good record with fast, mid-tempo, and a couple of slow tracks (which are my favorite). I don't know what happened to this group, the market may have been oversaturated at the time with their sound or maybe they just went their separate ways. Anyways, this is a good ""one hit wonder"" album."
4,I love great music no matter how old it is!!,"I am a 28 year old lady from new jersey. To all my people out there from the tri-state area who remembers Video Music Box with Ralph McDaniels.? They stopped showing it in NJ a few years ago. I remember watching the videos for the GYRLZ jam if you can, and if its games you're playing. They were too hot. I know their singing careers did not take off, but they went on to write a lot of songs for a lot of popular artists. They also sang backround vocals for a lot of songs. I know they did a lot of work with heavy d. I cant remember who else right now but I will find out and write back."
4,about this cd,i would like to know wyh they put this cd out of buying range because that is ridiculous for someone to ask 200 dollars for a used cd wow i mean there arent even any of elvis presleys cds on the market for that much
3,Over Rated & Over Priced,Some ppl may not like my reveiw about this cd but it is what it is! First of all i can't believe the price that they are asking for this cd. My opinion the two slow songs on the cd are the best songs. You can play them @ a party and the women go crazy. The rest of the cd is ok ... i guess? I'm not trying to leave a negetive review i'm just keeping it real!
3,Background singers for Al B. Sure!,I love the ballads. But everything else is just too old and dated. The production is very solid. And who know that they would kick one girl out of the group and become a duo? But it does bring back some good memories of the past
1,A Version 1.0 Product,"While the feature set described in this software is there, this is definitely the first pass. The software is sluggish on my 933MHz Pentium III, it is prone to crash or lock up, the software doesn't remember your view settings if you leave a window, support for 3rd party photo printing is currently minimal (one vendor), and the DVD format the software burns is not compatible with all DVD players. Wait for a major update before bothering with this software."
2,Annoying program to work with,"There are two annoying aspects of this software that prevent me from recommending it:First, it uses a great deal of system memory - more than any other program on my computer. The program often freezes as a result. Even when it doesn't, it can be maddeningly slow.Second, the way the tags are laid out, it's very easy to accidentally check a tag box while dragging that tag onto a photo. Result - the group of photos you're working on disappears, as the program executes a search on that tag. Very annoying and time consuming. This happened to me so often that I can't believe it wasn't caught in the development process.In short, this program is less than what it should be, and definitely not what I needed to organize my photo collection."
1,Missing Key Features,"Although this product might be of use to the very casual photographer with a small number of images to manage, it lacks two critical features that any one with more than a few-hundred locally stored photos will sorely miss: (1) no support for networked files without local caching and (2) no support for exporting catalog data. The lack of the first feature means that a local copy is made of each image you wish to index in Photoshop Album (not a good thing if you have several thousand images stored on a network!) and the lack of the second means that all of your data is trapped in Photoshop Album and is unavailable for use in other applications.Wait for version 2.0 or look elsewhere."
1,Photoshop Album - Beware,"I bought this product as a companion to Photoshop Elements 2.0.Album is one of the most bug-ridden products I have ever used.By contrast, Elements works very well. For a view of the types of bugs in Album, go to the Adobe web site, then navigate to discussion group under support for Album. You will find nearly 600 inputs, with mostly complaints and ""see if this works"" work-arounds for bugs. Far too many to list here. Album did not load on my desktop using WIn 98 2nd edition. I was told to look through the 600 user complaints to find a solution. It was there, but it took quite a bit of time. My notebook with Win XP installed ok, but would not boot up without yet another visit to the user's work-around pages. Product does not support some scanner formats (Visioneer). I was told to convert these formats to pdf so they would be recognized by Album.Consider other options than this software. It was not ready for release. Adobe usually releases good products. Not this time."
3,Critical Flaw,"As a photographer & Photoshop 7 user, I chose this program to be assured of it's ""full"" support for Photoshop .psd image files, which it has.I fully expected that the program would provide me the ability to create ""my own"" ""Categories"", then, create ""Sub-Categories within them.Adobe apparently felt that the typical user's of the program would lack the creative intelligence to create Main Category-titles of there own, so they, ""In Microsoft-mentality"", decided to provide their choices, which can't be changed or renamed.There's a work-around, in which you can select Adobe's ""Other"" category, and then make Sub-Categories within Sub-Categories; but need for a ""work-around"" is less than I'd expected from Adobe.I'd suggest checking out Picaso...or Kodak Easy Share -Free dowload, before settling on this one!"
2,Not that great!,I am disapointed with Adobe Photoshop Album. The quality of the photos I print using Microsoft Picture It! is much better. The colors print better with Picture It! also.I also found the Help with Photoshop Album to be lacking. I'm searching for a better program.
1,Try before buying,"I purchased Photoshop Album 1.0.50 for the ease of using drag and drop tags and tagging many images at once. Unfortunately PSA does not allow me to browse on my Win2000 Pro (SP4) based system. Consequently I can't search for image files or catalogs, nor can I save a catalog to other folders or drives. If you are considering this product, you should be aware that it is still fairly buggy. Trying out the demo version from Adobe might be informative, although it is a huge file (~126 Mb)."
1,Photoshop Album disappointing,"...I expect quality products from Adobe, and was eager to play with this tool. It was a disappointing experience. The menus were clumsy, performance was slow, the editing features were primitive, and it didn't watch folders to detect new images. I thought it was bloated and awkward...It appears I will stick with FotoAlbum...and PhotoshopElements (an outstanding Adobe product). After tinkering with Picasa, NikonView, FujiFinePix, KodakEasyShare, OlympusCamediaMaster, and PhotoshopAlbum, FotoAlbum is my favorite. It has the features I want at the perfect price."
1,Avoid This Product,"I would advise anyone considering buying Adobe Photoshop Album to visit Adobe's website. A look at the forum section will give you an idea of the MANY problems users are having trying to make this buggy software work properly.I installed the Starter Edition to see if I wanted to buy the full program later. My experience with Starter Edition was very positive. The full version is another story altogether. It simply won't install on my computer. The program claims to support WIN98 SE, but during installation I get a message telling me it won't support my operating system, which is, you guessed it, Windows 98 Second Edition.Another reviewer here mentioned that he had the same trouble and had to do an exhaustive search through the Adobe user forums to find a solution. Its pretty sad when a software comany's user base has to assist each other to use one of its products.Adobe has a good reputation, but this clunker is not up to their usual standard. Avoid it!"
4,Reasonable Solution for Image Management.,"I personally think this is a great product for handling all types of images from those taken by your digital camera and those you scan in. What makes Photoshop Album so amazing is the felxibility it gives you when it comes to managing, organising your images. Organise by type, date, category whatever. With the amazing timeline. It has features for cropping and perfecting photos but these are limited, they are still welcomed. One thing I hoped for though in terms of photo-editing, users who have Photoshop Elements installed on their computer could use the engine to edit photos, instead of having to use the independent tools Photoshop Album. Another feature that I think makes this a winner is the Slide Show feature, which is a must in all Image Management programs. I think this is great value at an economical price because of its image management, photo-editing and slide show, plus many more. This I think is a must have product to have on your computer."
2,Not worth the money...,"PC Magazine gave this program 5 stars. Did they use it or just read the feature list? I did not have any technical problems with the program just design and features. For a program that is first and foremost a catalog, there's no easy way to simply say ""update my catalog."" If you delete a file without using Album it tries to reconnect. No way to turn this irritating feature off. No way to select extensions to include in Album. Although it lets you select the folders you want included, you can't save the list for next time. It's also very slow to display the images and you don't have zoom capability. For viewing, it's not nearly as handy as Irfanview which is FREE. I remember Adobe Photo Deluxe version 1 which was so slow and bug riddled as to be unuseable. Eventually the product died. Looks like this one will follow in those ugly footsteps. Wish I could get my money back. Oh, I do like the timeline though. Really just a big disappointment."
2,It's a ok product if you don't have to bigge archive,This product is ok. But it's to limited if you want to maintain a lot of photo's If you have more then 300 photo's go look at imatch it's great and the price is good to.Adobe photoshop album is just to limited.
2,Try Extensis Portfolio,"I use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and PageMaker all the time. but Adobe has yet to publish a mainstream photo cataloging program. If you're serious about cataloguing graphics, try Extensis Portfolio. Much more robust."
2,Not up to Adobe standards,I purchased the software to create slideshows viewable on the DVD player. The software worked as stated but the resolution on the slideshow was poor. There was not enough options for music; listening to the same song (mp3) over and over got boring. These two problems make is necessary for me to look for other software. Good features were timeline; ability to add captions and ability to add video clips. I hope Adobe comes up with a free upgrade for their existing customers. They certainly did NOT live up to quality of products we expect from Adobe.
1,Half baked,"Do not buy this program. The software is unable to video encode a slide show to video disk or dvd. The online help file instructs you to remove any background music. It's amazing how these companies charge full price, taking good money for a product that doesn't deliver as advertised."
1,Priced just right,After all the money I've spent on Adobe software over the years I was delighted when they gave this away free at PMA. Now I see its PC-only so I guess I'm getting my money's worth.
2,Not the best,"I have used Photo Album versions 1 and 2, and have created CD slide shows of my bicycle tours. It is never easy to do. When you first import photos into the program's ""well"" they are large enough to see what's in them. When you go to the next stage (the ""create"" stage) -- where you can sort and re-arrange the slides -- the photos are way too small and you can't enlarge them. Also, I create title pages in Photoshop and import them, and in the ""create"" stage, you can't make out the words to figure out where to place them. Also, I have prepared complete slide shows and gotten to the point where I was previewing them (as happened today) and the program would freeze, and I lost hours of work. Not good! Now we know why Adobe has stopped selling the program and is just providing a simple version for free."
3,Delivers The Basics of Photo Management,"Album delivers all of the basic features you would expect from such a product with some minor weaknesses and some nice surprises. The Fix function is a bit weak, even compared to some free programs. Specifically, the lighten/darken feature is a bit weak and AutoFix does not seem to make any significant improvements to photos. The backup feature is very easy to use but it requires a new CD each time, even if you are doing incremental backups and only bakcup a small number of files. This is wasteful and is a weakness. The photo Move and Rename features also add a lot of value and work well."
2,Stacking Up Adobe and Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook,"Adobe Photo Album's advantage is its ability to catalog photos. However, I think that more and more people are beginning to look for the ability to organize photos with other files like words and music. For ease of use and ability to link photo with titles, text, songs and songs, the newly release Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook wins hands down.[...]I want software like Adobe to go beyond generic photo organizing capabilities. I'm looking to the new generation of software like Memories that can handle all sorts of multimedia and is very easy to use"
2,Not quite there yet....,"This is an OK program for organizing home image files in an innovative way. The tagging system saves some trouble of naming your images properly.However, it does not work if you're trying to organize thousands of photos on your harddrive. I think that the program will be at least a little better if it is also coupled with the ability to browse (in the Windows Explorer style, such as ACDSee) the images and also display the file names on the thumbnails. I got the software couple months ago, and I have not touched it since the first couple days of getting it. I still use ACDSee to organize and browse all my images.Overall, this probably works for home users, but for more professional image management, it still has a long way to go."
5,Adobe hits a home run,"I read a lot of comments on this product - both positive and negative - before buying it. I ultimately decided that the range of features offered by Photoshop Album - multiple-CD backup, photo organization/tagging, slideshows, single-click edits and auto-resizing for email - plus the excellent interface and Adobe's reputation were worth the risk that those who don't like the product are right. Turns out they're not. I love the interface, the tagging/organization is easy, fast and simply fabulous. I'm running the product on a WinXP platform with 256MB of RAM and have had no performance problems whatsoever. This is a great product and I highly recommend it."
3,Great product if not be used to create VCD/DVD,"This is a nice product with pretty interface, feature like tagging are useful.One big drawback is that it cannot create DVD. Even for VCD, it cannot create >100 photos in one VCD. (It adds a lot of junk in the VCD, and computer runs extremely slow and fulfill all the CD)."
3,Needs to make a few changes for SNW:VII,"First of all, nearly all of the stories presented in this volume were great - but there needs to be a few changes for SNW:VII. The first problem to over come is the fact that (in nearly every volume of STN) there are stories concerning Star Trek:TOS episodes""A Piece Of The Action"" and ""City On The Edge Of Forever"". While these episodes are very good, enough about them. Let's move on to others. (With ""City...."" we get it - Kirk was very upset about Edith Keeler's death.)The second problem is that there needs to be more Star Trek: DS9 and Enterprise stories. While the ""Enterprise"" series is still relatively new, there never seems to be more than three (some very short) stories in any given volume about DS9.Third, no more stories centering 'exclusively' around Data. This is one Star Trek character that the fans need to let go of. Enough of Data, already!"
5,well made,"good layout, plain and simple, you had to bend it in half a couple times just to get it to lay flat though. but eh, no complaints."
5,Great value on one of humanity's greatest books,I've had a set since the 1970's and they're still serving beautifully-- the sewn signatures apparently make for a lifetime purchase. Clarity and fingerings are perfect. Bought these as a gift.
2,Dover publications Beethoven piano sonatas,The Dover edition of the sonatas of Beethoven definately isn't the urtext edition. This edition is very cheap and that is a nice thing. But sometimes it misses some parts and has wrong notes. This edition is favorable to many people. However I suggest that this edition isn't the ideal edition. The cheap price tells you what's in the book.
1,Good,"My piano teacher recommend to buy this book to me.and i found on amzon website in good price!it is clearly printed, it is quite big in sizeand i like it! it is easy to see!"
4,GI jeep cap,ilike the hat. it does tend to fit a little big on a younger teen's head.i suppose i'll grow into it!itdefinately is good quality and andrew christianis a good company. do allow 2 weeks for it to get to you though.
2,Box Broken on arrival,"Nice looking set, but the hinges on the box were broken on arrival. The dominoes seem to be made of cheaper grade plastic, not quite as heavy as others, and the paint in the dots comes off easily. will not use this company again."
4,nice looking body,"I bought this coz i thought it looked nice. I used it in my traxxas bandit vxl and i had to do some body modifications. anyway the overspray film really helped a lot preserving the shine after painting. there were some errors on the stickers. some of them didn't really fit well, and there were two unlabeled ones. i also spotted two stickers labeled the same, both were labeled 70. Anyway when you figure out the stickers it looks nice. just don't use the soap and water technique coz the sticker might lose its stickiness. I painted mine red & black , and i put window tint."
1,EXPERIMENT IN TERROR,"WARNING ----------- BEWARE ----------- WARNINGDO NOT BUY THE EXPERIMENT IN TERROR VIDEO -------- THAT HAS A ""RED"" CIRCLE, WITH THE NUMEBER 12-------- AND THE BLUE OCTOGON, WITH THE NUMBER 12, ----- BOTH ARE LOCATED ON THE LEFT SIDE, OF THE BOTTOM; ON THE FRONT COVER OF THE VIDEO.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THE CRITICAL PROBLEM:** THIS FORMAT WILL NOT ""OPEN"" IN THE UNITED STATES FORMAT."" IT IS A BRITISH REGION FORMAT.** YOU MUST HAVE A ""REGION NUMBER ONE ( 1 )"" DVD ----------- TO VIEW THIS VIDEO IN THE UNITED STATES."
1,wrong copy,Wrong copy of the movie. Was not formatted for my DVD machine. Do not know why they do this. Really upset about this.
1,Experiment in Terror,"DVD was sold to a U.S. purchaser, but did not play in the U.S. Unclear where the product was shipped from, but there was no indication in the description that the disk would not play in the U.S."
5,a gem from the latter days of the film noir era.,"Experiment in Terror is one of those now rarely seen films from the tail end of thefilm noir era.Made in 1962 by Blake Edwards, who would later go on the make the Pink Panther films and Victor/Victoria, starring his wife Julie Andrews.This film showed what might have been, if Edwards had of kept on making detective and film noir thillers, instead of light fuffy comadies.A real edge of your seat movie.But I would like to know why the Marketplace Sellers want so much for this filmon dvd. 60.00 buck is an outlandish price for a film, just because it's on dvd."
3,On the road again,"The quality of the music on this CD is less than perfect, but the selection of songs makes up for the quality. I enjoy it and many other Willie Nelson CDs."
5,Tracks are...,1. On The Road Again2. Heartaches Of A Fool3. One Day At A Time4. Me & Bobby McGee5. Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain6. If You've Got The Money7. Why Are You Pickin' On Me8. Can I Sleep In Your Arms9. Uncloudy Day
3,Nice Illustrations/poor binding/flat commentary,I have enjoyed Roger Price's Droodles for many years. As the only collection of Droodles in print it is better than nothing. The binding on the copy I received was poor. The interior was falling out. This edition substitutes satirical pseudo art critic commentary for Roger's original commentary. It is not as amusing. The book format has one Droodle per page and a sparse commentary on the opposing page. Note that only a single title is offered per Droodle rather than several as Roger offered. The fake art commentary quickly wears thin. I hope that a complete Droodle collection with Roger Price's original commentary and all of his titles is printed.
3,"fun, but would have preferred less chat and more pix","The pictures are cute with a number of puns. I use it in English classes to practice correct question forms (I have the answers, the students must figure out what the picture represents). The exercise is highly motivating and the students often ask for more. The puns, on the other hand, are not suited to foreign language students or young children."
2,Not worth the outrageous price tag,"I'm totally happy to have this rarity on DVD, especially since my original VHS of it is worn out beyond belief. But it is certainly NOT worth the price that Amazon is charging for it. For starters, the movie is culled from a VHS source, and a poor VHS source at that. The print is fuzzy and almost out of focus, sound quality goes up and down. Even the artwork is shoddy. The special features are screen grabs from the movie. Why? I don't know.Like I said, this is a low budget, 16mm zombie feature with lousy direction and even lousier acting...but it's always been a favorite of mine...but just know what you are getting."
5,What's the Problem?,"I was surprised so few have reviewed this book and the four stars was equally confusing. The writing is superb. The dialogue is funny, genuine and snappy as all get out. The plot is fast-paced and the characters are colorful and interesting. Quite frankly, I couldn't put it down. Lashner scores with this one and adds a new fan to his readers base. I won't hesitate to pick up his next, in hardcover. Read it and enjoy!"
2,I was not thoroughly impressed,"This was my first Lashner novel, and unless popular opinion overwhelms me, it'll probably be my last. I'm a big fan of mystery novels and this one just left me a little unexcited. Although I felt I could root for the main character, the rest of the cast seemed unexciting and unmemorable. Lashner's writing style seemed at odds with the genre as well. It came across as too informal, too casual for the story. I followed this book with a Michael Connelly story and that eclipsed this in it's attention-keeping abilities."
3,Book One of the Secret Circle Series,"After reading the first two books of L.J. Smith's The Vampire Diaries, I wanted a break to read one of her other series before read getting back. I didn't have much knowledge of this series other than it was about a coven of witches.In this first book, Cassie Blake and her mother move in with her grandmother in this rundown New England home. Cassie has no idea she comes from the bloodline of real witches. This doesn't become apparent until one of them is murdered and Cassie is enlisted to complete the circle so they can unleash the magic that will lead them to the murder.L. J. Smith's writing style is the same as with The Vampire Diaries, but I found it lacking on action. Could be it wasn't supposed to be as action packed. Either way, I prefer a little faster pace for me little A.D.D. brain. Even though I couldn't get into the story and its characters, I'd still recommend this to fans of YA paranormal fiction."
5,loved the book want the next,"I abousulutly loved this book along with the rest of L.J.'s books witch I can never put down until I finish,all though this is the best I've read so far. I hope someday(soon)I can find the remaining books #2,#3 I'd love to find out how this series ends! END"
5,AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!,"I am going to tell you to read this book, because it is really a great book, but I'm warning you, the other two are hard to find, and it really ends in a cliffhanger. I've looked around in 2 states for the 3rd book, and I STILL haven't found it yet. I'm beginning to get REALLY mad! Well, a book this good can kind of do that to you.."
5,Secret Circle 1 was great!,"This book really modernized witchcraft for kids of today. The witch lore was accurate as far as I can remember, and the idea of making the girls parallels of old goddesses was a stroke of genious on Ms. Smith's part. A really great book whether you're into magic or just want to read some horror-meets-romance. --Stormdanc"
5,i loved it!!! superb book!!!!,i loved it!!!! it was great .as good as the night world books(which i also like ) i recommend it to every one!!!!!
4,"Delicious, traditional L.J.Smith","The Secret Circle carries LJS's mark all the way. You've got the strong female lead ... the beautiful (and wicked) enchantress ... the equally beautiful ""good fairy"" type ... the dark, brooding bad boy (the highlight of every LJS book). You just can't get enough of the woman's work - even if some of it sounds awfully similar to her other books.In The Initiation, it is exactly as the title suggests: Cassie is initiated into the Secret Circle, a coven of witches in New Salem, after many trials. Then she realizes that the guy she'd been obsessing over for the entire summer it seems like is her new best friend's boyfriend. Worse, the real ""witch"" of the witches - Faye, reminiscent of Blaise and Maya - finds out that Cassie's messed with her almost-sister's guy - and she starts to blackmail her. Meanwhile, an old evil has been released...For some good old-fashioned LJS delight, read this!"
4,I like the original series the best,"I liked the three book series when it was first published. It was really good and the characters weren't all alcoholics and self centered kids like the show made them.Now I don't know if the author is using the show to sell more books, but if she keeps writing the characters like CW they'll turn into a bunch of alcoholics. Take an AA section writers before you make these kids worse. But as it happens the show was canceled.When I read the original three books in the 90's I related to the characters. I also enjoyed the way the author made witchcraft a fantasy.She made it black and white and unrealistic to allow the magick to be a background character.I enjoyed and remembered this three book series more than her vampire four books."
5,"Makes you say ""Wow""","This book really made me say ""Wow"" when I finished. It was such a GREAT book and a wonderful way to start off a trilogy. At first I was kinda turned off by the cover. So basically it was sitting on my bookshelf for about two or three weeks. Until one night I got real bored and decided maybe it would put me to sleep. But it did the exact opposite. I stayed up ALL night reading and nearly finished at daybreak! I should have already known it would be a great book I mean it was written by L.J Smith! I think Ms. Smith is a brilliant author who never ceases to amaze me with any of her books that I've read so far. So if you are a true L.J Smith fan (which you should be) PLEASE don't be like me. Get the WHOLE trilogy as SOON as you can. Because now I am sad to report that I cannot seem to get my hands on #2 The captive. Which is driving me utterly INSANE! So save yourself the aggravation and your sanity and get your hands on the WHOLE trilogy."
5,This is a great book!,"I have read and re-read this book and it is one of the greatest books in a series that I have read...ever! I am madly searching for a copy of the third book, the power, and if anyone has one that they could sell to me, email me!! The way that L.J. Smith writes amazes me, because when I am reading it, I feel like I am there, and all the ation is going on around me!! THIS BOOK IS SO GREAT!! Shavonne"
5,"Action packed story with horror, love, and witchcraft!","I absolutely loved this story! When I first saw the cover, I hesitated. I didn't know how this story would turn out. I'm so glad I read it! I was thrown into Cassie's world from the beginning and got to see her find out she's a witch with powers and becomes a member of the Secret Circle. I loved the romance between Cassie and Adam! The way Ms. Smith described their passion for each other was wonderful! I loved the conflict with Cassie and Faye - and their struggle to win the fight of good over evil. Good thing I bought all 3 books together, as soon as I finished the 1st one, I picked up the 2nd one right away and was not dissappointed. Its a worldwind of love, mystery and magic! Don't miss out on a great trilogy!!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This book definitely disappointed me. The people on Earth screwed up in a bit way, creating a substance called mycora. It expanded exponentially and took over the place, and kept on going.A few people got away. The rest of it to me seems very fuzzy and furry, and generally pretty dull."
2,Intriguing idea ... bad execution,"I was hooked by the premise and choked by the writing. I ""sped-read"" the final 50 pages or so for some inane quest to get my monies worth. Wil McCarthy might have potential writing half hour plots for sci-fi TV shows."
2,shrug,"I had high hopes for this book, but here's my report: interchangeable characters, disappointingly predictable extrapolation of technology, and a trite conclusion. It pains me to say this, but this novel could've been written by any number of fellow engineers--except they don't pen novels, they stick to engineering.I do know some folks who could use a 'tickle capacitor', however! Time to 'Preview my Review'..."
3,Starts well but gets tangled in jargon,"I was really enthralled with the first hundred pages or so and read them in almost a single setting. The concept was truly intriguing, and the mystery of the Mycora kept me wanting more. But the characters soon lose depth and are put on the back burner so that McCarthy can fill the pages with useless descriptions of spaceship physics and this Game of Life. I read those pages over a few times and still couldn't make a whole lot of sense out of them. The point he's arguing is clear, but he could have done itin a more friendly fashion. It's a quick read and is entertaining and the action is well written, but characters are important too."
2,Borrring,"I started this book expecting an absorbing near-future mystery, and ended up barely slogging through it. The characters were cardboard, the ideas intriguing but the author seemed to think that introducing the idea is enough. Developing it to an intriging conclusion wasn't part of the deal. I finished it only because I try to finish every book I start."
1,Dry Reading,The portions of the book that I read were very dry. His use of Calculus integrals in the text is a turn off for the average sci-fi reader.
3,Fitfully Paced,"This story had some good ideas, but was too fitfully paced. That is, there was too much there for 300-odd pages. The final (and predictable) confrontation had to be resolved in about 100 words. This is nobody's magnum opus."
3,Good idea for not an easy read,"Lots of technical, detailed descriptions about the science behind the idea of nanotechnology gone amuck. If you like your hard sci-fi very hard this book is for you."
1,Boring!,"While the newspaper review was promising, the reviews here at Amazon tell the full story. Uninteresting characters, dragged-out story, predictable plot, sudden ending. I'm glad I got it from the library -- a cheaper disappointment by far."
4,Scared the heck out of me.,"The main idea brought forth in this book scared the heck out of me. The idea is that wandering nanotech could drift for ages, then suddenly ""bloom"", eating all matter in the vicinty, thus creating terrible destruction. The book would translate to film very well.Sure, some of the characterization is weak, but that's not why we read hard-SF like this. The science and the ideas are key here, and Wil McCarthy delivers on both."
2,"Agree with ""shrug""","There is a review in the list titled ""shrug"". I agree with this person. I saw the book advertised in ""the Scientist"" an excellent bi-monthly science magazine (which I read from cover to cover) and it gave me a ""must have"" feel. I was disappointed with the style, content and the end. In all not what I expected. barely two stars."
4,Can't ask for everything - one molecular biologist's lament.,"This is a great book by a terrible writer about a fascinating subject.In short: the solar system has been eaten by grey goo. Humans have escaped to the asteroid belts and tiny moons that are as yet uninfected. ""Something"" happens and a small but hardy band of them has to return to the center of the infection, discover a terrifying secret and decide the fate of mankind.If you skip the embarrassingly written sex and love bits (or even better, just all the parts where people actually talk to each other) you get truly breathtaking nano-tech sci fi. Truly, really visionary and important.This book should get 6 stars for the science but gets 2 knocked off for phenomenally bad writing."
2,Not set in Montana,"Beware: this is set basically entirely in New York, because that's where MOBSTERS hang.If you're looking for the Z-Grade ""Clay Pigeons"" ""Montana's"" title and genre suggest, try ""Route 9"" instead. This film's been tagged with the dreaded ""failed Tarnatino clone"" label, and with good reason."
5,Sheepskin Steering Wheel Cover,This Sheepskin Steering Wheel cover helps the driver in many ways. First it helps to keep the Steering Wheel nice and cool. My car being black it get's hot in the parking lot. This cover helps to keep my steering wheel nice and cool and it prevents me from having to drive with a steering wheel that's too hot to touch. Also it's softness allows the driver to handle it without it being rough. For thoes who live in the north were it is cold this cover could feel very nice when you touch it from being in the cold. The softness of it can make your hands feel warmer. I believe its a good product no matter where you live in the cold or warm area.
2,Disappointed..,"Pros: Fast Shipping. Nice Price.Cons: Slightly disappointed with the actual product. The sheepskin quality is acceptable, but the inner lining is made by really rough fabric. The seal edge of the sheepskin is made by really rough fabric, it felt like i'm grabbing on fishnet whenever I drive. It's been 3 months since I started using this product and now the whole piece has lost the tightness or elasticity and it fell right off from my steering wheel. I admit that I live in a hot city, but still the quality is disappointing. Now I just use it to wipe the dust in the car.This is my honest opinion of this product and just take it for what it's worth."
4,Updated,"Here's an update: I liked this product at first, but after 6 months of use, I'm less happy with it. The elastic has loosened, causing me to constantly readjust it around the wheel, and it constantly throws off lint, making my dashboard very linty and dusty. I'm now looking for an alternative. A shame, really.I need a steering wheel cover that protects me from the burning heat of the desert sun and provides a good surface for gripping. This one fills the bill. Even on the hottest day (and it's routinely over 100 F here in the summer), the wool is warm, but not burning. I was a little afraid that it wouldn't provide me with a good grip, but have no fear! In fact, it's so soft and cushy, it makes it downright fun to grip the steering wheel. Wish I'd gotten it in the gray color, though."
2,From Great to Awful,"So first off; I LOVED my sheepskin steering wheel cover.It feels great on your hands: during the winter the frozen steering wheel is much more tolerable and the sun seems to have no effect on it. This was a huge improvement to my sticky, deteriorating steering wheel. And it's true, the padding does make for a thicker, better feel too.Then I bought a new car and brought my Sheepskin Cover along. Taking it off the old steering wheel and onto the new one was enough to stretch the elastic past it's comfort zone. Within the year I started to notice bald spots on the cover. And the sheepskin hair had to go somewhere - along with the bald spots I was noticing ""sheep hair"" on my dashboard, on the floor, on my sweatshirt, on the shifter...Lastly; I hate my sheepskin steering wheel cover and threw it out less than a year after buying it."
5,Sheepskin steering wheel cover,"This product is really nice. It is a heavy fabric, soft and warm, and stays put on the wheel. It is a very attractive creamy yellow color. It looks really nice in my BMW - rich looking to match the interior."
3,steering wheel covers,"Not as happy with these as the seatcovers. They were hard to put on my cars, and keep shifting around the steering wheel as if ready to pop off. It's like they were mis-cut somehow. It was so tight getting it on that it kept popping off. As I said, when I did get it on... it seems out of line on the wheel. It's great other than that for keeping my hands warm. Just annoying to have to keep straightening it all the time."
1,Shapeless,"I bought this steering wheel cover a month and a half ago. It fit a little loose at first, but stayed on just fine. I removed it over this last weekend because it has NO elasticity left to it. I had my last sheepskin steering wheel cover for over 3 years before it literally fell apart from use, but it still fit tight. I'm very disappointed in this."
4,"Feels great, wears thin, cheap enough to replace every 2 years","Six months after it started keeping the steering wheel cool in the summer and not freezing in the winter, half of the cover's 10 or so patch-work-pieces of real sheepskin is wearing thin from use, so within a year, it will all be thinner than the luxurious feel it had when first placed on the steering wheel. But at this price, you could just plan to replace it every year-or-two to continue to enjoy how great it feels in those first 3 or 4 months. I drive about 8,000 to 10,000 miles a year."
2,stiff and doesn't stay in place,"I really wanted to replace a previously owned stretchy lambskin cover, but this was the closest I could find. While the quality of the sheepskin is nice (after years of fake synthetic ones), the piece is really stiff and does not stay in place... which could be dangerous, as the cover will turn with my hands and the wheel goes nowhere. It does seem to fit just fine, just doesn't stay in place. Thinking I will try to sew it on and see if that makes it a bit safer, but would rather something that just was more stretchy. Oh this was for a standard steering wheel on a Corolla that has never had fit problems before with covers."
3,"Sheepskin is great, elastic stinks","I have loved sheepskin steering wheel covers for years, so when I could no longer get them locally I was glad to find them on Amazon for an inexpensive price. Replace inexpensive with cheap. The sheepskin and lining have held up well, but the elastic gave out early on. Without elastic, it will not stay on my steering wheel, so the product has a very short life."
4,Lund 95017 Genesis Tri-Fold Latching Tonneau Cover,"The Tonneau cover is performing very well. It was simple to install. Due to the dust and pollen in Las Vegas NV. It requires wiping down once a week. The interior of the truck bed stays nice and dry. When folded up for hauling items, it stays put. It fits my requirements very well. Excellent product for the price. The only reservations I have are the latches are made of plastic. I don't know how long lasting they will be in the high desert."
5,good toy,its very cool and its a lot of fun.but it dont have a card shuffler=(.but it is a lot of fun and i think its best for people over 6 years.i`ll hope you`ll like it
3,Looks cool but...,It just doesn't beat a traditional Game Mat. This thing will tire out your arm and are somewhat limited to what you can do.Plus a game mat won't cost $20 like this thing does.
3,The Chaos Duel Disk RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The Chaos Duel Disk RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can't get much better than this! IF your kids want one or you want one GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,a bit of a pain,"hi, before you buy this item, please take into consideration that when you first buy this toy it takes a little bit of time to assemblethe loose pieces and that you can't use the sleeves to protect your cards from being damaged and that at first when you put it on your arm it hurts that little bone that sticks out on the outside of your lower forearm because there isn't alot of padding on the wrist gaurd, but other than that, i really like this toy (even though I just bought it yeasterday) especially that it now has a feild card zone.thanks for reading my review"
1,Waste of time and money - C to the RAP,"It's Dark-X A.K.A. Derek Semeraro and I am not reccomending this product. I know all these six year old kids want to be just like the characters on the show, but you have got to listen to me. In a game of Yugioh, it is much easier to duel on a table with a dueling mat which is much cheaper too. This item looks good on T.V., but is atrocious in real life. It's really heavy to wear on one's arm and it's a social life embarassment. Is this something you would spend 40 dollars on?"
1,Yu-GAY-Oh,"This thing may seem great when you first see it, but don't be fooled. All you can do with this is makeyour cards more stable. The things worthless. Even if you love Yu-gi-oh, don't get it, don't waste you time' don't waste your money. The Duel disc is really worthy of the mighty Yu-GAY-Oh."
5,Chaos Duel Disk,"This toy is fantastic!The deck holder can't hold more than 52-54 cards.The bad thing is that you cannot use sleeves, but the cards will not scratch, if you use them normally.The graveyard holds my whole deck(46 cards).The life point counter counts up to 9990 points.I reccomend it cuz its not heavy and is very fun."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!,"This Duel Disk is so COOOOOOOOOL!!!!!! It is better then the first. I feel like a champion when I am dueling. My most powerful monsters are Theinen The Great Sphinx, a few Blue Eyes White Dragons, Shinato and a Blue Eyes Shining Dragon. If for any reason you want to duel me, contact me at savvy84@hotmail.com . Oh by the way I am 21 years old. Anyhow this is a must buy for anyone who is a duelist."
4,Auricalcuos duel disk! sweeeet!,"For those hiding under a rock, You should really try this toy. I think it also makes a good weapon if you are extremely mad at someone. The cardholders are nice, but I'm waiting for a duel disk that can handle sleeves. I gave it a 1 in durability because I am not quite sure."
3,"Minor improvements over the previous model, but nothing too amazing","The Chaos Duel Disk is pretty much average as far as duel disks go. It is much more compact than the previous model, but it still can't accommodate card sleeves. The life point counter, like the last version, will only go up to 9990. Overall, it's a cool piece, but I would really only recommend it for cosplayers. If you want to get as close to the real thing as it gets, get the Yusei Duel Disk 2010 Version. (At the time of this review, these two disks were about the same price.)"
3,Yu-Gi-Oh Wrist Dueller OK,"For kids who are strong enough to use the Dueller continuously for an hour or so, the length of a duel, the product will be good. For my seven-year-old nephew, I saw him resting the plastic Dueller on his leg or his other arm a lot. The idea of the product is great, the reality is cumbersome and heavy for smaller kids."
5,i hope its better,"I personally know how bad the fisrt one was so i hope it gets better like u no with a super rare card i dont want to ruin it. and like before i hope the grave yard is bigger. I am 13 if u live around depere,wisconsin and would like to duel contact me at domongundam@msn.com.thanks"
4,wow,see this is a very cool toy but if uve got no one to play with another disk there is no point in buying it the original was bettetr but this is blue it lights up and that stuff buy it BUY IT BUY IT BUYIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,5 reasons not to buy this toy.,1. You can't use protectors.2. A mat & deck box would be easier.3. It's as heavy as someone standing on your arm.4. It is hard to put cards in the last slots.5. You will be laughed at and bullied.
1,Come on it is Just A Fancy Handle box!,"First I think this is one way to waste one's moeny cause it just holds cards. It has no value in it but to set a child fantasty with a toy that very small, which does not adjust to the person wrist, and it breaks easy. So trust me when I say this not a great iteam and spend one's money on toys, yu-gi-oh cards, and a box holder which does the same thing as this product."
1,"I'm not crazy, it is worthy of Yu-GAY-Oh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","1st of all..you can talk to me being cool and my opinion when you come down to my middle school and say that out loud. Your opinion sucks, just like this toy. I mean ,$35.00 for a stupid thing like this?! I had it for a week after I got it for Christmas before it was in a dump. Yu-Gay-Oh is the dumbest show, and card game ever.P.S.- Yu-GAY-Oh ain't my name."
5,Real Game,This toy is great becuse you can play the real yu-gi-oh game with it. I thought you had to play a different type of yu-gi-oh game with it but you don't. This is also great for new yu-gi-oh players it is like a handheld mat.
5,"Wonderful, inexpensive machine!","I love this machine. The best thing about this machine is its ease of use. I have never owned a sewing machine that was easier. The first day I set it up, my first words after sewing a few seams were ""What a dream to use"".If you are new to sewing, this is the perfect machine. I sew quite a bit, dolls, cloths, and quilts, and this works just perfectly. My more expensive machine has been banished to the closet. I haven't had any need to bring it out.For most sewing needs, this is a great buy."
1,Broken in 10 months,This sewing machine worked moderately poorly until today when the gears stopped working. A repair of approximately two hundred dollars doesn't make sense for this brother. Will report back after testing the limited lifetime warranty with Brother.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$,"After carefully researching & reading all of the glowing reviews for this machine, I purchased it from Amazon in Aug 2011. I loved it at first.... BUT after just 3 short months of minimal use, the tension is completely SHOT! I can't even use the machine. I can't get it to sew a decent stitch on any tension setting :( Waste of money, DO NOT BUY this machine. I spoke to another sewer on my online sewing group & she has the exact same model, only 6 months old & same thing her tension is completely shot & machine is useless!"
1,A flimsy piece of junk!,"After reading reviews and doing lots of research, my husband bought me this as a gift. If you are just sewing thin cotton and making blouses, I guess it will work fine. I, however, sew denim, and the darn thing wouldn't work with any thick material. I actually got an error code and it refused to sew. The problem is the pressure foot won't go down far enough with thick materials and therefore the computer won't let it sew. So if you make suits or coats, sew denim or children's toy repairs, this MACHINE WILL NOT WORK!!!! And forget the needle treader. It twisted in less than an hour so it didn't go thru the eye of the needle, which was predictable since it was so flimsy. The thread broke about 5 or 6 times in the hour I was trying to use it, and it bunched up inside the machine. Just a flimsy piece of junk! Where can I get a good solid metal machine like my old Singer from 1957?"
5,Brother CS6000 The best Sewing Machine I ever had,"I am glad I bought this machine. If you like computers, this is the perfect sewing machine for you. It has so many advantages, it is amazing! The price is affordable too. It is a pleasure to test and work the beautiful stitching; buttonhole; buttons;zipper; blind hem;overcast; quilting and a lot more. Once you practice the needle threader, it becomes very easy and is so convenient.By Gloria O"
5,happiness is a new machine,"My old machine literally stopped in the middle of a project. I had looked at new machines for some time, but kept putting off a purchase until it became urgent. Thought this one would see me through until old one was repaired. I haven't even attempted to get repairs on old one. So far this machine is great. Just select stitch and size, set speed and push button to sew. Easy bobbin loading. Seam allowances are marked on the plate-no more masking tape.I have done samples of some of the stitches and am looking forward to my next project with this machine. AND it has a very reasonable price."
1,broke after 4 months,Machine locks up with error message that indicates there is tangled thread but there is no thread that I can find to clean out. It's under warranty but the closest authorized repair shop is more than an hour away from where I live.
5,Love my new Brother sewing machine,I replaced my 35 year old irreparable Singer with the Brother CS-6000i.I have had it for about 2 weeks and love it. Have had no problems with tension. I followed other reviewers instructions and read the manual thoroughly first. I have tried only a few different stitches. I am anxious to try the quilting.I had trouble at first filling the bobbin properly but was able to work out that problem quickly. I love the push button sewing. A great buy for the money.
5,it is really good,"it is great, thanks lot, my wife like it, it have many function, and very easy to use.she make a curtern within 2 hours, and it is quite beautiful"
5,Amazing price for an amazing machine!,"I have had this sewing machine for a year and a half, and have used it like crazy. To be honest, I've been bad and have done zero maintenance on it, and this thing has never skipped a beat. It's by far the best standard sewing machine I have ever owned.I absolutely love the variable speed, and how many accessories it comes with. I have encouraged all my close friends who keep asking me to teach them to sew to buy this machine b/c it is easy and intuitive, and it is an amazing machine for the price."
5,Great Sewing Machine!,"After a hard decision to spend $200 opposed to $500 on a new sewing machine after my 1978 Kenmore crapped out, I decided on this brother and thought my daughters could use it if it weren't enough for my needs for quilting. I love this machine..... the control, the lack of noise, the variety of feet were quite impressive. I will probably have to eventually spend the $500 on a machine but for the time being this was a great choice!Brother CS6000i Sew Advance Sew Affordable 60-Stitch Computerized Free-Arm Sewing Machine"
5,Great Sewing Machine,"I love this machine, it is light weight, and has all that I need. I had a singer that was 40ys old and broke down. I wanted to try another brand and read up on what people liked. My daughter just purchased a singer a few months pryer to when I bought this one and it broke already so that is why I tried this one. I did sew something on this machine and it was a pleasure, it has a few speeds that I like so you don't have to lightly press on the foot. I like the threader feature, also easy bobbin. So far I think it is great and would recommend it."
3,Great Machine but shipping may cause problems,"I think this is a great machine and buy for the money. The problem I had was with the tension on the dog feeds or bobbin. The machine would drop stitches whenever I tried to use any stitch other than staight...even zig zag stitches did not look right. I called Brother several times and tried their suggestions. They advised me to return the machine. I even called the closest service center, which is 60 miles away, and they wanted to keep the machine a week if I brought it to them. BUT, I had to have a receipt with the serial number on it and Amazon does not put serial numbers on their invoices."
1,Buyer beware!,"I bought this machine based on the good review written here. It is not worth the money. It is VERY picky about thread. The bobbin jams CONSTANTLY. I have broken every needle that came with it. I am an experienced sewer and was only sewing two cotton-blends together. The bobbin-case was scratched and was causing the jamming (according to the manual) so I bought two new ones at $35 each. With literally the first gingerly stitch with a new case, it snapped the neede in two. Today, after using up every needle I had, I still am nowhere near the end of my simple and lightweight project because the bobbin keeps jamming, for NO REASON. It was a total waste of money and I am really angry that I fell for it. I have another Brother machine with the same problem, different model. THEY ALL HAVE DEFECTIVE BOBBIN CASES!!!! KEEP AWAY!!!!"
3,Easy to use but not well-made,"Love, love, love this machine. I have never sewed a day in my life. Yet within half an hour of unpacking this sewing machine, I did my first stitch. This machine has tons of features that really help the beginning sewer. And the number of stitches you can create and the collection of presser feet you get is just astounding for this price. If you are on the fence between this and another machine, get this one. You won't be disappointed.UPDATED: 7/19/2011 -- After less than six months and with only minimal use, the machine stopped working. It wouldn't draw up the lower bobbin thread. It's going to cost me $60 to get it fixed. A machine that cost $160 should not break that quickly. I'm very disappointed. While I still think the machine is easy to use, I don't think it's built to last. Probably would not purchase a Brother next time."
5,This sewing machine is FANTASTIC!!,"I got this machine last November. I had been using my Grandma's sewing machine (40 years old) - I only sewed when I HAD to. Now I WANT to sew! It's so much more fun when you don't want to throw the machine out the window. I had been avoiding making things with buttonholes. Well, last week I made a shirt. It needed buttons. I followed the instructions in the manual, and it was like MAGIC. I have never taken sewing lessons, and this machine is easy to understand and use. I would recommend this machine for anyone."
5,Une petite Merveille,"Bonjour à vous tousJe viens de recevoir en suivant les conseils d'une internaute couturière, cette petite merveille. J'avais une vieille Brother qui a rendu l'me cette année après 20 ans de bons et loyaux services et travaux. Je viens de recevoir parfaitement emballé ma nouvelle machine à coudre depuis votre grand pays jusqu'à notre petite France. Tout était intact et très bien conditionné. Après déballage, je viens d'essayer tous les points, puis du tissu épais que j'ai plié plusieurs fois pour tester la robustesse, la machine est extraordinnaire et s'est réalisée aux différents exercices sans problème. J'espère qu'elle durera aussi longtemps que la précédente. Je la recommande à toutes les couturières mme débutantes car elle est très facile à mettre en route (mme quand on est pas pro en anglais ou en espagnol: mode d'emploi). Cette machine est un petit bijou!"
2,Poor Fabric Feed,The only issue I had with this machine is the poor ability for feeding the fabric when there are only two layers of cotton with interfacing going through to be stitched.
1,Terrible customer service for defective product,"I bought this sewing machine three weeks ago and am working on my first quilt. I've been using the walking foot for a few days and the walking foot 'jumps'. It's a defective walking foot. I called Brother, and expected them to send me a new walking foot. That would be decent customer service for a brand spanking new machine. Right?!No. I need to send them the foot with proof of purchase, and they are going to test it out and let me know what they are going to do about it. Seriously?!If I still had the box, I would send the entire thing back. Talk about not standing behind your product."
5,Awesome!,This sewing machine is perfect! I have used it to make quite a few thick layered fleece items and a quilt so far. I know I will be using it for many years to come and that it will last! It comes with so many accessories and even a cover for the sewing machine itself. It arrived quick and the package wasn't even damaged. Can't beat that for free shipping! This machine is definitely worth it.
4,Not bad!,"I wanted a mid-range sewing machine with some flexibility, and this is the machine. I sews quickly and flawlessly, and is super easy to learn. It seems well made, and very intuitive to learn. I love the computerized stitch selection - so easy to change stitch length and width. I've had no problems with winding the bobbin as in previous Singer machines. I love the fact that it comes with a quilting table and a case, too, what a deal."
4,Brother CS6000i,"I purchased this machine so I could begin quilting and make some other projects. I have always owned a brother and this one seemed like I got more bang for the buck. I have to say I opened it and immediately started sewing with it. It is dummy proofed in case you need to take apart the bobbin area has the dots to match up and it is very easy to use. I read online where other customers said it doesn't like cheap thread and that is true. I have snapped a couple of needles trying to sew through some thick material but eventually was able to do it. This machine is a great value, works very well and I am extremely happy that I purchased it. One other nice feature is the machine is so lightweight and easily moved."
5,Great sewing machine,"I have had a Brother sewing/embroidery machine for the past four years and love it. I purchased the Brother CS6000I for its size, to take to quilt camps and classes."
3,WARNING!!! NOT GOOD FOR HEAVY FABRICS!!,"I bought this machine to replace a much heavier and larger machine that I gave away as I no longer have the space for it.This is an ok machine for the price. BUT!, if you are like me and a frequent use for your machine is hemming jeans then this is NOT a good choice. Even on light denims it chokes, badly.Even with a fresh, specifically denim needle, the right thread, etc. etc., it just jams almost every time. It simply does not have the force to go through layers of heavy fabric.If you are only doing light weight fabrics this machine does a lot for the price. For heavy, you simply need a much heavier machine."
3,Not for the frequent sewer,"Regarding the Brother CS6000i sewing machine - I purchased this sewing machine because it was described as a ""workhorse"" along with other flattering comments. While I cannot say anything truly negative about the machine, I will say that the term ""workhorse"" is misleading. An authorized Brother dealer told me that this machine is for the occasional sewer, to be used a few times a year. I do not sew fancy, complicated, or heavy-duty, but I do sew frequently, as in several times a week. The machine locked up on me after only 6 months of use, and, although the service is under warranty, I still had to drive about an hour from home to drop it off and will drive another hour to pick it up. I have now purchased a heavier duty machine and hope to have better luck."
4,AMAZING! :),"I was a little hesitant buying this sewing machine at first, because I heard it does not sew heavy fabrics well, and I really needed a machine that can sew up denim pretty efficiently. However, I had little to no trouble with sewing my denim, so I sighed in relief. Threading is so easy, and the machine itself is very lightweight and portable, which is just what I needed because I am a fashion design major who lives off-campus! I wish it came with more presser foots so that I don't have to buy those that are not with the machine (like the concealed zipper foot, gathering foot, etc.).But nevertheless, it was such a great buy. Totally recommend it for beginners. You're going to love it. Totally worth the money."
5,So Easy,"I'm 26, and the last time I even tried to sew anything was 8th grade Home Ec. When I read the reviews for this sewing machine, I crossed my fingers that I'd be able to figure it out.I did. It was quite easy in fact, and though there were points that I had to read the directions several times to understand, I was able to understand.Unfortunately, due to some personal financial issues, I had to return the machine only a few days after receiving it. I know that when I have the money, I'll definitely be repurchasing this machine. It was actually fun.The instructions were clear, the machine was lightweight, yet still stable, and it was easy enough for my sewing-ignorant self to figure out. I can't wait to get my hands on one again."
4,This Senior can now sew the fancy stitches!,I like this machine a whole lot! It took me a little time to get the tension right. I had to do a second bobbin. Guess I didn't get it right the first time. But now it is purring like a kitty and sewing like a dream. I love the automatic features. Just made some napkins and sewed # 57 around the center panel. So pretty! Think this will be a great little machine.
3,Works well until you need to clean it.,"I've had this machine for about 2 years now and absolutely LOVED IT... however every time I need to remove the needle plate to clean underneath it, get a tangled thread out, etc. it frustrates me to no end! The screws are in exactly the right spot that the screwdriver (that comes with the machine) will not fit up under the arm to get to the screws. I have tried every angle to no avail. I don't remember how I did it last time (because I have been able to take it off before to clean it), all I remember is that it was very frustrating. And today I needed to remove it so that I could untangle the thread and I can't for the life of me figure out how I did it last time. So anyway, I gave this machine 3 stars because it really is an excellent basic machine when you are actually using it and it does all the basic stitches plus a few cute/useful extras but cleaning it is a total hassle."
4,Up and running!,"For a novice sewer facing (with fear and trembling) the prospect of trying out a new machine, this was the right choice! Easy to use, easy to understand directions, buttons where you want them and expect them to be...this is a good, solid machine that may be the one that gets me and keeps me sewing!"
1,Terrible stitch tension and needle breaking issues,"I purchased this machine because it has a lot of nice stitches and buttonholes. Plus, the price was good and the reviews on this website were excellent overall.However, my experience has been the same as the other 1-star reviews.No matter what adjustments I make, or thread I use, the stitch tension is a mess. It makes lots of loops on the bottom side and makes a mess of loops every time I go in reverse. I can't adjust the tension to make a difference.Also, it breaks needles all the time, but also jams on needles all the time. You can't win.Bottom line is this thing is junk. I've had to go back to using the 35 year old machine I got as hand me down from my mother."
5,Great machine,"This sewing machine is really great, it fits all my needs, which are sewing for home, for me and for my kid. It's a light equipment, easy to use and fast. I loved my purchase."
5,Excellent,"It was better than I expected. Fast shipping, the product was as described. Very good purchase. I'm very happy with this machine since it works almost by 'itself'... :)"
4,brother's sewing machine,A little different to get use to being that it is computerized. But sews very nicely. Came with a hard cover. Love the bobbin insert where you do not have to pull up the bobbin thread.
5,sewing machine,"I love my new Brother CS6000i sewing machine. It works beautifully. I have never had a machine where you did not have to use a foot pedal. I thought it would take me a while to get used to it or that I would just prefer to use the foot pedal, but I love the push button start and stop. I also like that when it stops it stops with the needle down. I have not had any problem figuring out how to work the machine other than the automatic needle threader. I have not figured out how it works but I am sure once I figure it out it will be nice."
4,Overall Happy,"All in all I'm pretty pleased with this sewing machine. I'm still trying to figure out the quilting though. I'm having trouble using the free motion foot. When I try and do stippling, the stitches don't catch. It will quilt fine for a while and then not catch the stitches. But I'm still working on that, so I may not have the machine set correctly. As far as sewing - it's GREAT! The different stitches are wonderful. Overall, I'm very happy. Once I get the free motion quilting figured out, I will be 100% content with this machine, but right now, that is a big struggle. Does anyone else have this problem? If so, do you have any advise?"
5,Great Purchase,"This machine is easy to use and works well for the little sewing that I do. I was worried about learning to use a new machine after my 30 year old Kenmore died, but the directions are easy to follow."
5,Brother CS6000i,Great bit of kit I brought this for my wife who swears it is the best sewing machine she has used. very light construction so treat it very carefully when moving it. Shame its not avaliable in the UK with a 240v option. Dont forget that you need a 115 V transformer to run this this side of the pond (UK) which will add about 30 to the total cost.....
1,Great...for a little while...,"I loved this machine because of its ease of use and wide variety of stitches. It worked great until it read error message ""E6"" which means there is tangled thread. There was no tangled thread that I could see, but I cleaned out bobbin case and rethreaded the machine. Still no luck, instead it now made a horrible sound before beeping and then showing the error message. I used this machine for maybe 5 hours when it did this using light weight fabric, quality thread, and a simple straight stitch. This one is going back and I'm looking for a different model. If it has problems this fast out of the gate, I hate to see what happens after a few heavier projects."
3,Not Able to Use to Full Function,"Look, I researched tons of machines and prices, functions, etc. This is a great machine. The problem is the booklet that comes with it!!! It is so confusing and unclear! I try to figure things out and just can't. It's like a totally technical booklet for non-human users who speak robotically. Maybe someone who has more recent experience with these computerized sewing machines has much better luck and quicker understanding, than I, is doing just fine with it.I sewed shirts, stuffed animals, made dresses, etc. in Jr. High & High School but haven't really used a sewing machine for years. So I thought I would be fine but I have purchased new stylish ""sew"" books but they do not help me with THIS MACHINE.I have went to the Brother website - which is very unfriendly - and researched for a better booklet but haven't found anything yet.Entire experience all the way around has been somewhat of a disappointment. I keep searching for something to help me with it though."
5,Brother CS6000I sewing machine,"This machine is wonderful. The directions are easy to understand and the machine itself is easy to operate. Very lightweight, Brother Deluxe Electronic Sewing Machine - CS6000imaking it easy to haul to classes. I do a lot of blanket sewing for charity [...] and this machine is a dream come true for me. I would buy it over and over and over again."
2,"Add me to the ""dreaded E6"" club...","This is my first sewing machine, and I got it for Christmas from my husband. I was SO excited. I read lots of reviews, and I was stunned by the positive reviews this machine got. It seemed like a no-brainer. Everyone just loves this machine!And I loved it too...for about two weeks. I almost finished a quilt project entirely before I started getting the E6 error...over and over again. One Sunday, I spent two hours threading and rethreading the machine. I'm a pretty patient person, and this machine has me at my wit's end. I'll be sending this back to Amazon. Don't be fooled by all the good reviews...this is a total lemon. And don't even try to call Brother...what a nightmare!"
2,Not recommend,"This machine is no work horse. I have used for about a year now and have ""tossed"" it aside. It is too lightweight to handle any serious sewing. Might be good for a beginner just learning, but it didn't serve my purpose. Probably give it away since my local sewing repair shop says they see a lot of them and don't recommend them."
4,brother cs6000i,"so light weight, it's like lifteing a feather compared to other machines, great stich selection at my fingertip, this is one smooth and easy running machine."
4,brother cs6000i,"I bought this machine as a portable to take to classes. I am very pleased. It is very light weight and has many features. It is a very reasonable price, considering all the features.. I have had trouble with the self threading mechanism so just gave up.."
1,Very Weak Machine--Very Bad Purchase,"I am very disappointed with this sewing machine.I can't even use it on medium weight fabric the machine,just vibrates and needle will not go to through.It has no power at all.Also there is a piece of metal underneath the feeder that the thread continuously hangs to it and it makes the thread tangles. Very bad purchase for me. Very frustrating to work with and it Finally quit working."
1,Save your money,"This machine really rates 0 stars, but that choice is not available. The list price is over $400. I'd be contacting my state's consumer protection office if I had paid that much for such a low quality product.I have been sewing for almost 50 years and have never had so many problems with a new machine!! Despite the description, it is not so easy to thread the machine. It is not the needle that is the issue but rather the thread uptake lever; it is nearly impossible to get the thread to pass from one side to the other. If you desire to work on denim then you will really have problems. This machine will NOT sew through the heavier layers at the seams when hemming jeans. I have spent hours trying to get the machine to cooperate and still have not finished one leg. I would definitely return this machine if I could but too much time has elapsed since my purchase. Since it is considered polite to say something nice, here goes: it is easy to wind bobbins."
5,This is an AMAZING Machine,"I must admit, I had not sewn anything in YEARS before purchasing this sewing machine. The manual is fantastic! I was able to follow all of the directions to set up my machine, perfectly. It is amazingly easy to use, even if you have little experience with a sewing machine. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. The low price is just a plus to an already fantastic package. If you are hesitant on what machine to get, and if you were like me and haven't sewn in a long time, this is the machine to buy! I could go on and on, but simply put, this is the machine to buy."
3,Difficult to thread,I do like this machine so far - have just had it a few weeks - BUT it is very hard to thread! The little arm that goes up and down is difficult to catch and it takes too long to get started. Wish I had known this as I would have tried another brand.
2,Not happy,Machine locked up after less than 30 days of use. You get what you pay for. Had to have it repaired.
4,Great value,I was looking for a replacement sewing machine. I'm a beginner and didn't want to spend too much money until I knew how much I would use it. This was a perfect replacement machine for me!
5,Love it,I have used it everyday since I got it . Obsolutely love it....Best sewing machine ... Would recommend it to anybody.
5,Brother Sewing machine,Very light machine for transporting to classes. Works well and has excellent features. Sews as well as the much more expensive machines.
4,Good for Beginners,"I got this machine to do some small projects. Its a great machine for the price, but anytime I want to sew more than 3 pieces of fabric together the machine beeps and refuses to sew. I have had this machine for about two months and recently the tension has been weird also. Don't get me wrong, this machine is easy and fun to use, but sometimes it just doesn't have enough strength to get the job done."
4,Great Machine in so many ways,"The price is amazing and it sews beautifully-very easy to thread, lots of great deco stitches... needle up/down and sewing speed adjustment was a must for me however...I am a Quilter and the machine is so light weight I'm concerned with feeding Quilts through and the machine staying put (have not tried the larger Quilts yet). My only complaint is the needle cannot be positioned to the right, center is as far as it goes so a 1/4"" seam is not possible. You will need to order the 1/4"" piecing foot separately-it is not included in the quilting package that comes with the machine. The machine will need to be pampered a bit as most of the parts are plastic-not like the good old machines with metal parts but all in all very happy with the machine so far!"
5,Great for Beginners!,I'm new to sewing and have used this machine for about 6 weeks. I've only done simple projects with it so far but have had a great experience. My mom is a very experienced sewer for several years and has also played around with my machine and wants one for herself! I can't wait to learn more of the features!
3,Love the features and ease of use; but have had to have it repaired more than once,"I really like this machine, all it's features and controls. It's very easy to use, and I've made a lot with it, including a whole stash of cloth diapers for my son. Maybe that's why I've had trouble with it--maybe. More than once I've had major problems with the machine keeping tension, and had to take it to the repair shop. Unfortunately the only Brother authorized shop is about an hour away, and they tended to blame the malfunction on me, telling me not to use a different thread in the bobbin than on the spool... which I never do, I use the same white thread for pretty much everything. So I'm not really sure what to make of it. Maybe just a lot of sewing through elastic and several layers while making diapers was too much for it?? But still, I'd expect a machine to hold up to moderate use like that. Maybe I just got a lemon, who knows."
5,Everything I wanted for the price I wanted,"I couldn't be happier with this machine! For less than $200 this machine packs a big punch! It is very easy to wind bobbin, thread, change the presser feet, and navigate the digital interface. It handles every kind of material easily including denim (which I tested by patching jeans - it even made it through the thick seams with no effort!). True to the description it is very lightweight, and this purchase comes with every additional accessory you could want. So far I've used it for patching jeans, making Halloween costumes, and a few general garments. I'm looking forward to trying out more of the features for quilting - the prospect is promising! If you purchase this machine, I know that you won't be sorry. It is worth the money, it is very easy to use, and the user manual is easy to read and covers every troubleshooting question you might have!"
4,Worked for me!,"I bought this quite some time ago and have completed several different projects with it.I sew as a hobby (toys, clothing, home-goods) and this sewing machine is everything I could need for the price. If you are just starting out and need a machine that will last you throughout your learning period, I highly recommend this one. I feel like my skills have improved quite a bit since purchasing this machine and don't yet feel like I've outgrown it.I bought this after my 35-year-old, hand-me-down Kenmore bit the dust. That was obviously a heavier, heartier, sturdier sewing machine, but the lightness of this Brother model has actually been somewhat of a boon, as I have packed it around to various crafty get-togethers. It's very portable in that respect -- light enough to haul, but not cheap and hasn't broken yet. I have a soft-sided sewing machine tote that straps to my back and it travels nicely!There are much nicer sewing machines available, but I feel this is a good value for the price."
5,Best Sewing Machine,"I purchased the Brother CS600i sewing machine about 3 months ago and I love it. I haven't sewn in years because my sewing machine was not fun to use. I found myself fighting with the machine more than sewing. The first day with this Brother sewing machine and I was in love. It does everything from straight stitching to buttonholes with ease. It's very easy to control the speed and just makes sewing a pleasure. I like the needle threader and the ease of changing bobbins. I was surprised at how light it is, making it easy to set up and to store. This machine is worth every penny and then some."
3,Maybe I got a lemon?! but overall its good for the price,"Unfortunately I think I got a lemon!after One week of using this machine, I started to hear a clanking noise on the handwheel and progressively gets worse. I would then turn off, unplug and not use it for a whole day, Next day after a few minutes of sewing, would clank again.. It didn't affect the performance, however it was quite noisy and not a normal sound. Price was great, for the value. I would have been very happy, unfortunately I had to return it. Some stitches did not turn out the same as pictured on machine.... then again, I might have received a lemon. I will try another Brother, but it might be my last. My last brother was also ok for the money as well. Love the digital function! One thing it should have is a last recall memory button. Everytime you turn it off, it resets the stitch function.... very annoying."
3,good machine for the money,"This is a good machine, I have had mine for 3 years, but you must not use a heavy weight thread. I piece quilts, & now after 3 years the tension is wearing out& was told by the repair shop that it would cost more than the machine is worth. So if you want a machine that will last a long time get a better one than this."
4,Works great.,The sewing machine has been great to me so far - I have had it for a month or so and it's done what it needs too. I love the numerous stitch options.
1,Believe the bad reviews.,"I worked on this machine for about 8 hours before giving up and returning. I am an experienced seamstress and sell much of what I make, primarily appliqued fleece baby clothes. The fleece didn't feed well through the machine, stitches were skipped, and the top thread looped and tangled on the wrong side. I contacted the manufacturer and tried all suggestions - their final advice was to return to the dealer. Too bad the machine had some nice features. The decorative stitches were clumsy looking however."
1,Horrible Buy,I have had nothing but trouble with the machine since I bought it. I used it only a few times and it started breaking needles. I looked in the manual and it said that the bobbin case was scratched and so I bought another at $35.00 and that did not work. So I decided to see if a professional could help. Well he did for a short time and then it started having the same problem. I spent $80.00 to have it fixed the first time and decided to take the next $80.00 and apply it towards another machine instead of getting frustrated again.
1,had to return TWO of these due to defective buttonhole....,"Very disappointed. I am a seamstress & neither time did the automatic buttonhole maker work. It's computerized so no part to replace, it just ruined 3 different coats I was making. The stitch was wrong, didn't go the right direction, VERY hard to fix a messed up button hole, hard to rip. Very frustrating. Got a refund, new replacement sent only to have an even worse button hole. UGHMy bad luck or faulty product?? If you don't SHIR (which it also won't do well at all) or make button holes, then go ahead, this machine is fine for the price. If you need all the features to work, avoid it."
4,Brother 60 stitch...very nice,"I used to sew all the time. I now only sew occasionally and had been ""putting up"" with my old Kenmore sewing machine for that reason. It was a great machine in its day, but that was over 30 years ago;-)Anyway, I decided that the price was too good to pass up and I want to start sewing more. I was so busy over the holidays that I just had a chance to set up the Brother Computerized sewing machine and have the following to say:1. I was amazed at how light this was compared to my old machine2. It worked wonderfully on my first project, a set of drapes for my mother-in-law3. It was very easy to use, and great instructions.4. Loved all the attachments/feet that came with it as well as the ""extended"" sewing surface.5. Great deal for the price.The only negative I might have is that the light could be brighter. I was sewing in a well lit room, but the light on the machine is not very bright.Otherwise, this is a great little machine for the money."
4,Great little machine,I am happy with this miachine. My only complaint would be that I cannot figure out how to use the automatic needle threader. I wish there was a video to demonstrate its use.
4,Great product,"This sewing machine is my first machine. I think it does exactly what it says it will do. I use it for sewing on cub scout patches and awards, and for quilting."
4,"Great machine, but a bumpy start","This really is a great machine for the price, but it took a while to figure out why the bobbin wouldn't set properly. Turns out the manual was not clear and I was doing it wrong. Now that I've got it figured out, I have about a 90% success rate with the bobbin. Unfortunately it still gets completely tangled up every so often. I have wound several different bobbins (ALL specifically for this machine) and tried them all but eventually they all tangle. But I'm still happy with the ease of use and amazing variety of stitches."
1,Misfortune,"I bought this machine in 2009 for my wife for Christmas. No matter what she does, it always breaks the thread. I am so disappointed. Why couldn't she have had a good experience with this machine."
2,discouraged,"I bought this machine a little over a year ago and it's been at the repair shop twice. When I get it working, I'm happy. But I spend more time fidgeting with the machine than actually doing projects. Maybe I need a more heavy duty machine? I'm just bummed that it hasn't worked out."
2,Stiching problems?,"The machine makes a loud clicking noise, and then the thread gets all tangled up inside."
2,Slanted pull through machine,"This is our first machine in quite some time and it all started out great. We love the features and ease of use is a big plus.That being said, we now have a problem with the machine drawing fabric through at a diagonal slant. Somehow, the stitches come out straight but we have to work at a diagonal which will be very difficult for larger projects or tight corners. The fabric also will 'bend' and curve itself from the force of a diagonal pull and straight stitches.If it weren't for that problem, we would probably go for a 5-star review as the features are nice and the machine is easy to maneuver. At $160 online, this machine is a good buy...now to fix it!"
5,awesome sewing machine,"I bought this sewing machine to get myself started on sewing, as I had not had any experience in sewing before and had only a portable small sewing machine that I thought would be enough for my minor alterations and repairs, but I have to say that the CS6000i is just so awesome, even for me that I had not had any classes or attended any workshop, it just makes sewing something fun and lets you focus on your creativity rather than the hassle of poor stitching or threading mess of other sewing machines. The manual is pretty self explanatory and it has so many different types of stitches that you just have to make your mind on what would be the next thing you want to try...I am having so much fun and thinking of having this for long years to come. Worth every penny!"
4,Great light-duty sewing machine -- and VERY affordable!,"I got this machine in March 2009, and it has performed even better than I expected! I have been using it to sew cloth diapers and various other small items. It is extremely easy to use and become familiar with. My favorite feature is the needle raise/lower button. I would definitely recommend (and have!) this machine to others for everyday sewing projects. This would not be a good machine if you plan to use it for a business where you sew from home or anything, but it is a fantastic machine for the price. The main reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is made mostly of plastic, which is fine but this probably won't be an heirloom machine or anything. Overall, great machine, great price!"
3,Died after 2 and a half baby quilts!,"My husband bought this sewing machine for me two years ago. It was all love at first, the way a newbie loves, not knowing any better. :). This machine is perfect for a beginner but as I gained my sewing legs it quickly showed me it couldn't keep up. I was recently working on making my first ever baby quilts. I got through two and a half and it died. There was much grinding and death throws. I cleaned and re-threaded but still got the same dying motions and sound effects.Bottom line: if you plan to actually make this machine do some work, it's not the machine for you. Invest in your sanity and get something that can get the job done.If you're just learning and need something for small projects and fun, it's perfect for that."
5,Brother CS6000i Sewing Machine,"My old machine died so I had to get one quick. I borrowed my sister's Brother machine, but it was the next model down. So when I was looking on line I found this model for only $50.00 dollars more than what she paid. Her's is a front loading bobbin and the one I purchased is a drop in bobbin. Much easier to use. I don't care what kind of machine you get, get the drop in. I love this machine it sews so smooth and has a needle threader (in case the eyes are goin!) Great buy. It came quickly and was packaged well. I would definetly buy from AMAZON again."
4,delivery almost ruined my christmas,"I put on the order "" this will be a gift."" The package came in the manufacturers box. They left t on the doorstep as usual,but since the contents was written all over the box,, with pictures of the product, it was very evident what it was.Thank god I got to it before my wife. To all future buyers from AMAZON - beware if its not gift wrapped. No surprise with a gift."
1,brother cs6000i sewing machine,"I have been sewing for 50 years and have never had a machine like this one. Thread breaks because it wraps around spool holder, bottom thread breaks, I have tried every thing that in my experience of 50 years has taught me and with no success. I am an avid sewer and put any machine that I use to a grueling test. This machine should be sold only to a NON sewer that way they wouldn't know any different. This machine is very light weight, and the cover is useless. The cover can only be used to cover and not transport. CHEEP ! I intend to put it in the garbage because that is where it belongs, I wouldn't stoop so low to sell it to my worst enemy."
1,Agree with the bad reviews...had it for 2 weeks and then kaput!,"I bought this machine with high expectations as it was my first electronic machine but boy, I wish I had just gone with a simple regular machine. At first it was great but then 2 weeks later nothing but E6 error messages and jams. I eventually returned it but I'd never buy another Brother electronic machine again and would advise you to stay away. :-\"
4,Lots of machine for the money,I purchased this for my wife. Have only had it for a month but she tested it on sewing jobs that were problems on other machines. Very easy to use I even tried it and was able to sew. Very light weight and my wife likes the versatilliity. Great price quick shipping
4,good machine for a beginner,"I read all of the reviews here before I ordered this machine, and I admit, I was a bit insecure about it because of some of the negative reviews here. I have been using this machine now for several weeks, sewing up to 20-25 hours a week while taking a sewing class, and the Brother CS6000i has been wonderful. I have no experience with any other machine, so I can't compare it to other machines, but for me, it has been an excellent choice."
5,Great,This machine for the price is great. I would recommend it because of the many features and the size. Can take it anywhere.
4,Pegasus,"I am a quilter. I wanted an inexpensive, light-weight machine that could travel with me and one that would enhance my workroom along-side my Viking Rose. After months of shopping around I found this machine on Amazon. It has been a joy to work with and at 16 lbs, it easily fits in my carry-on with lots of room to spare. The basic satin stitch is much better and more uniform than my way more expensive Viking that is constantly in the shop for expensive adjustments. It has now become my go-to machine for piecing, appliqué and machine border quilting. The selection of built-in stitches is fabulous and it's easy to set up. I love it."
