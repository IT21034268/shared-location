3,"Great on walls, not on ceilings","I spent a great deal of time attempting to get results on a ceiling to install my new Dutch Oven Copper Pot Rack. No go, after trying every tip they mentioned for 45 minutes, I gave up. Works fine on walls, though be careful you don't have interference from wiring or perhaps switch boxes that may reside on the opposite side of the wall."
1,PRO SL is not a PRO,"The PRO SL was purchased to replace a very old Zircon Stud Finder. This one consistently gives false readings or stops working, and has to be switched on and off. Just used it again and it missed the stud by several inches. I am a professional cabinet maker, and have installed many cabinets etc. with the aid of the old stud finder. This one is useless. Will try to contact the company and update these comments on their response."
1,"I thought Zircon was ""The Name"" in Stud-Finders","I am highly disappointed with the reliability of this unit. This device produces way too many false readings. As I am slowly sliding it against the wall, a lot of times it will just start flashing all of the leds with beeping. This requires 2 power cycles to start over (the first one puts it in Deep-Scan mode).I was attracted to the ""Zircon"" and ""Pro"" in the name at such a low cost. I guess you get what you pay for. This $20 is going in the trash!"
1,Junk,I used one of these for a while and at first it wasn't too bad. Eventually for some reason it just kept giving false readings. I changed the battery but it still didn't work right.I ended up using a nail to fuind my studs. I returned it and I am trying the Zircon Multiscanner Onestep. Unfortunately there are no reviews here for that item. If that doesn't work I'm trying a new brand.
1,disappointed in zircon,"I bought this one cause the Zircon I had for two years (with maticulous care) just stopped working. I wrote to the people at Zircon and they wrote back ""What are you disappointed about? How can I help?"" leading me to believe they stand by their products, but that was the last communication in over two weeks. I hope that this one lasts more than a couple of years, however the quality of this one does not seem to be as good as the old one which broke. I get more mysterious false indications with the new model. I am thinking that the one which just detects the metal in the screws might have been the better choice.***update*** The zircon is now completely useless. I get false readings consistently. I had to borrow my neighbors stanley Intellisensor and had absolutely no problems with it. I have been burned my zircon twice. There will not be a third"
1,Junk,I didn't buy this unit at Amazon but purchased at Lowe's about 2 years ago. I have yet to find a stud with it. Just a simple sheetrock wall and it can not locate a stud. I have better luck with a nail and a tape measure. Total junk.
3,Fine for most but a little too picky,"This stud finder is great for those dealing primarily with drywall. I have owned this unit for years and found it great for drywall applications but other substrates confuse the unit. Sometimes you'll find contradictions or different exact locations of the edge of the stud but I got around this by taking sample readings in the area, marking each and averaging before drilling.Deepscan mode didn't seem to make a difference and I actually found the unit to be more precise and give less false readings under NON-Deepscan mode.The rapid flashing indicating a need to re-calibrate has been a bit annoying but easy to remedy by removing from the wall and trying again. The unit just seems to do this too often.Overall, for $20, you can't beat it but if you want A/C detection, etc try another unit."
1,Just plain crap,"For some reason, I own two of these. Neither work correctly. One has no audible sound at all and once it starts flashing, it will not stop. The other has an audible sound and it also will not stop flashing or beeping once it starts. Suggest you save your money. I personally would never buy anything with the name Zircon again."
2,Caution: You might be confused,"First of all I am a EE major and not a CS major. That being out of the way this book is more or less useless. True, it does introduce you to Animator and some programming. However, what it does NOT do is help with learning JAVA. I myself understand what I need my program to do but am frustrated by how to do just that on some of his assignments and his exams. If you are not required to purchase this book don't otherwise if you are well there is not much I can say. In addition, a book that I have found that may be useful is Beginning Java Objects. Other reviewers have made suggestions of titles that are more useful then this one. If you are a nonprogrammer it is worth your while to invest in one of the books mentioned by me or the other reviewers. Hell, the tutors make it easier to understand JAVA then this ""book"" does."
1,Wish I could give 0 stars,"I can't decide which is worse: this textbook, or the author's lectures. If you want to get a better Java book, I would suggest Java in a Nutshell, or pretty much anything else. This book writes to you as if you were 5 years old and were staring at your first computer.If you are serious at all about learning Java, don't buy this book. The first several chapters deal with a silly Applet called the Animator, which uses commands and syntax that you will never find when doing real Java programming. There are much cheaper ways of levelling out that lop-sided table that you might have. If you are ever to take a class that uses this textbook (I can't imagine there would ever be one outside of Pops's class), don't waste your money. In fact, maybe you should seek a different university."
1,I can belive it !!,"I can belive that David A. Poplawski has created a book, the book is hard to read, hard to understand and does not offer any useful content, the examples are horrible and only reflect stuff that it is used on academia, not on the real world.I think the author need to work on the real world and understant that the animator is not close to any real world application.Please, if you want to make more money please do not write a book and force students to buy it. Write a good book that people will buy on their own."
1,DANGER - AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of CS. Yet to be quite honest even if I was, I would NEVER have bought this poor excuse for a textbook. Unfortunately, ""good old"" Michigan Tech FORCES every one taking Pop's class to use this ""book"". If you don't have to buy it, don't!! It degrades its readers, which is quite a feat when one considers the text itself is hard to read due to the fact that its poorly organized! Its like he taking to someone with the IQ of an insect. Avoid it, it isn't worth the $90+, hell it's not worth the paper its printed on......"
1,My goodness!! What a piece of crap!!,"If I could sum up this book in one word, it would have to be WOW! And I don't mean ""Wow, what a fantasic book!!"", but rather ""Wow!! This book is absolutely no help to me what-so-ever!""As others have stated, this book is poorly written. It teaches down to you. How is that supposed to make you want to learn Java? Also, what's the deal with this 'animator'? Poplawski makes his little program (an applet actually) sound like God's gift to beginning Java. It's not! You're never going to use it ever again after you use the book, but he still insists on you learning commands for it! Why? Clearly, Poplawski doesn't have a clue on how to teach Java (A fact he backs back quite well during his lectures, should you have the displeasure of attending one).Do not buy this. You can get much better references and instruction manuals than this. Better yet, you can get many of these other guides for cheaper than this."
2,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 34","Another curiosity in John Huston's filmography. The screenplay is very thin if we put aside the soccer theme. So let's focus on the performances of Pel√© and his comrades who are, let's say it once and for all, soccer stars and NOT football players (you know, this American game featuring men in shorts fighting for a ball). A DVD strictly reserved to soccer fans or John Huston completists."
3,"So, So Movie","The movie is obviously old. Soccer team formed from concentration camp prisoners to play German bad guys. Rigged match, decisions to be made. Acting is classic Stallone.. ie pretty bad. Bought the movie more to see the real soccer greats Pele, Bobby Moore, etc.. Some soccer action, nothing to write home about."
3,"Crap, but good","so I went to see this with my brother when I was a little kid. My dad took us and he read a newspaper for the entire movie. Watching it now, I know he was the smarter man. I packaged it back up and sent it to my brother....."
3,Great for Soccer Fans,"The story line is a little weak, but for those of us soccer fans who have had to settle for such juvenile fare as ""The Big Green,"" it is nice to even have a movie which involves soccer in a serious setting. One would think that the most popular sport in the world would engender more cinema. Of course, Stallone is a joke as the second string goalkeeper who, of course, saves the day in the final game. But Michael Cain is great as the coach (who blows Stallone off as a horrible player, for most of the movie.) But the most ridiculous scene is when the entire soccer team of prisoners have a sure chance to escape, but insist (led by Pele) on returning to try to beat the German National Team, in the second half, when already down 4-1, with Pele off injured. Fun stuff though, for the true soccer fan -- especially to see a truly biased referee in action! And old Nazi war movies are always a kick!!"
3,In the Tradition of The Great Escape,"A good War Movie, About comradery and teamwork. Despite a weak script, the drama makes it all worth while."
3,Victory didn't score a victory.,"I saw this first as a kid at the theater and like it. Watching it as an adult, it lacked the suspense I remembered and the plot was ordinary."
5,victory,"a very clear dvd with excellent audio, color, good acting, A young sly stallone, different role for him. Michale Caine good as well. Only a few well known actors."
5,Excellent. fast delivery.,"Excellent dvd. There has only been a few good football movies and this is one of it. (John Huston's the director, of course its good) Also it was the fastest delivery yet. Good job."
4,"War, football and being a sport !","This movie is an all time classic!This movie is neither about war nor about football. It is about the spirit of fairness in sports.The setting is World War II, a POW camp in Nazi Germany and a football match between the inmates and the Nazi Team.It has Pele (acting and playing) and a handful of other famous football players from Allied countries. It is a movie which has brought out the acting side of Sylvester Stallone. And, the whole cast is anchored around Michael Caine, with his great screen presence and accomplished acting.All is fair in war, and the Nazis consider this game as an extension of the war. The Underground Resistance is plotting to evacuate the inmates when the players are into the game.There is this honor of winning the game, there is this blatant foul play by the Nazis and there is this escape opportunity! The movie is a must see, to know what happens!This movie is a must for your collection!"
5,pittodrie,fantastic movie any soccer fan or anyoneinterested in conflict without bloodshed will love this dvd
5,Great Football and Great story,"i think anyone interested in WWII or Football (soccer) has to watch this movie, you really get great performance from Michael Caine and Max Von Sidow. These guys really make you believe the story, which for anyone who ever played football soccer for even a minute and got the bit of enjoyment, it wont be hard to follow and this movie will be excilarating. Aside the story of propaganda and Stallone as the stubborn hero, the team really comes together, which is another reason why this movie is good for both afficionados, sport enthusiast and WWII interested"
2,Not a good introduction to the Congos,"This album doesn't adequately showcase the Congos's trademark falsetto over baritone harmonization which they did so well on their landmark ""Heart Of the Congos"" album. In addition, it suffers from massive overproduction. The instruments and the mix sound much too digital and artificial; completely lacks any warmth all around. Somehow the inappropriate production stifles any attempt by the group to deliver a soulful performance. Save your money and buy the classic ""Heart Of the Congos"" album produced by the legendary Lee Perry; a guy who knows how to mix reggae the right way!"
1,white man reggae,"what a boring waste of time and money is this really the congoes?? they are aiming at the middle class ""Alternatives"" so if yer one of those you will enjoy.... they must be skint but now iam after wasting my spondulees on this"
5,Best Film on the USS Franklin,"This film is by far the best of the documentaries on the USS Franklin thus far produced, with excellent original footage."
3,fearful chair,"there is a chair, and it will be passed on. but to who? things are not as they appear. the owner's brother wants it, his wife's son wants it. unfortunately, his own son does not want it. it is in fact his greatest fear. can the chair act on its own? there is great writing here. a great deal of psychology and ""hidden"" elements, some i did not see. good descriptions. but in the end, we are not given enough about the chair. i expected the story about the chair to really develop into something, or at least a very good psychological finesse. but no. therefore: 3."
2,Scary Uncle; not chair!,"Although I love this guys writing style, this seemed to be more of a story of a twisted murderer Uncle than anything to do with the chair. It never explains WHAT,exactly, if anything, even posesses this chair? It was an interesting history of the WOOD the chair is built with, but beyond that, it doesnt make any sense. The Mother in this story is such a weak person, you just want to slap the crap out of her. I felt sorry for this poor abused kid the whole time I was reading the second stage of the book, and hoping his Uncle would just die. It isnt a ""scary"" story."
4,Looks like another contestant for The Chair.,"An interesting premise molded into an enjoyable read about a young boy's torment. Sullivan writes well keeping the reader interested in his characters and the situations he puts them in. BORN BURNING is dark, erie, and has a warped sense of humor. A great late night book that burns time with cool little story."
3,No pictures/Keine Bilder,The pictures made half the story... without them... oh well I was not pleased in any shape form or way. But the story is there.
4,So good I didn't care it was historical!,"This is the exciting story of Joseph Charnetski, a teenage boy in medieval Poland bound by an ancient oath to protect the Great Tarnov Crystal at any cost. The Great Tarnov Crystal at first seems to just be a huge diamond, but it has a secret I will not tell or it will spoil the story. In the story, a Tartar chief is after the jewel and will stop at nothing to get it. This story gives two ideas of what things were like back then: how dangerous life was, and what alchemists discovered while searching for a way to change base metals into gold. I liked this book so much I didn't care that it was history!"
5,A family favorite,The Trumpeter of Krakow is a multi-generational favorite in my family. My mother read it back in the 1940s; I read it in the 1960s; and my son read it in the 1990s. This adventure tale of 15th century Poland is one of the best of the Newbery Medal winners.
5,"Old story, current message","I gave this book a 5 star rating because it is well written, touching, uplifting and educational. I would recommend it to anyone interested in historical Poland or just looking for a great story."
3,The Best Prologue,"My favorite part of this book is the five-star prologue. It tells of the history and patriotism of the boy who honored his vows to play the Heynal even through an attack by the Tartars. ""Poland lives, he thought. And then it came to him, young as he was, that he was part of the glorious company of Polish men that was fighting for all Christendom against brutal and savage invaders... I shall keep my word, he mused. If I die it shall be for that. My word is as good as my life.""I like to pair this book with The White Stag by Kate Seredy to give another viewpoint. ""For years there was no rest for them, there could be no rest. Like a sharp wedge they had driven themselves into Europe and now they were surrounded by enemies; they had to go on or perish."""
5,chaski,This is an unusual story that combines history and legend of Poland. It includes alchemy and magic that were highly suspect in the 13th and 14th centuries in Europe. The book is fast-paced and covers a part of the world that is not well known in the United States. Kelly truly knows and loves this part of the world and its history.
5,Nice watch!,"Excellent quality for the money. Not discounting the quality by any means, just saying that this is high quality watch for a small price. Very easy to read face and looks good for dressy occasions. I've had Pulsar watches before and keep purchasing them because they've stood my test and last forever. Quick shipping was a nice bonus as well!"
3,Crown?,"Others warned about the ""screw in crown"", but I ordeered on the positive information. My watch looks good and the weight is fine. After I recieved the watch I had to set the time and discovered the crown would not screw back ""in"" to operate in the normal manner. Maybe it will work after I leave it for a day or two. The crown is a pain as others have said."
3,Decent Watch for Price,"This is a nice watch for the price, and is nice looking. It looses a star or two because of its screw-in crown. While that is good for HEAVY activity and makes the water depth greater, it makes the alarm function burdensome. Pulsar and Seiko alarm watches like this, without the screw-in crown, are great for using the alarm, especially as a very quick and easy countdown timer (just pull the crown out, push the bottom button to move the alarm time, and push crown in -- REALLY simple, and since the alarm clock is showing the actual time when not set to the alarm time, setting anywhere from 1 minute to 12 hours ahead is simple. But not so with screw-in crown, where you have to unscrew and screw back in the crown to change the alarm time)."
1,Book not as good as advertised.,"This book, Practical Research: Planning and Design, was not sent to me in the best conditions. It was definitely used pretty extensively, although the description led you to believe otherwise. The book was very crumpled and crushed on the edges and many pages were folded in half, as if to indicate that the book was crushed side ways."
2,Disappointed upon receipt,"It's supposed to be a new item, but the book was wrinkled with a few wears on the binding."
2,Not for beginners!!!,"This book is an erudite discussion of Spinoza's philosophy which presupposes a lot of previous knowledge of his doctrine. To take but one example, the first chapter does not explain the central notions of substance, modes and attributes, but discusses them, which is mainly done by comparing the points of view of several Spinoza scholars. All in all, this so-called ""guidebook"" is in fact a kind of dialogue the author is having with other specialists.Therefore, if you want to get acquainted with Spinoza and undestand the basics, don't buy this book. I recommend Robert Duff's ""Spinoza's Political and Ethical Philosophy"" instead."
3,scratched,"This is a nice mask, but beware of the risk when you order online. The mask came without a protective lens film (not sure if they normally do, but they should...) and the lens was scratched, not to the point I wouldnt play with it, or try to return it, (b/c i am a broke college student with out the money to buy another and without the time to deal with the costumer service) but a new mask that wasnt scratched would have been nice"
5,"Great product, a little pricey","It fits well, covers what it should and isn't as hot as others. It feels lighter than it looks. I'm waiting for the price to drop before I grab another one or two for my kids.My hat size is 7 3/8, and I had no problems with fit. If your ears stick out on this mask then you might need to get a job as a side show freak, or try flying Dumbo style."
4,Tricky at first,"This product came fast, looks great and has little fog, however this is all well and good until you have to actually remove the lens for cleaning. At this point I actually almost gave up on the mask, but I'm glad I persevered. After popping the lenses in and out the first time (took hours) they started going in and out a lot faster. Now I can easily pop them out and clean them off. As far as playing my only complaints are that if my ears were just a little bigger the earlobes would probably be uncovered. Other than that I got one with the fan and I never have trouble with fog even in light to moderate rain. It's comfortable and in camo no one can even see you. I'm perfectly happy with this mask, but other good ones that I almost got (you might want to check out) are the JT Proflex, and V-Force profiler"
3,Misleading,I just received the JTUSA Flex 9 mask in the mail. The pictures are misleading. I figured I was actually going to receive the exact mask that is pictured. The mask that arrived had a clear lense. I read the previous buyers review and it did not register that the lense pictured is not the actual lense that comes with the mask.Please keep this in mind when purchasing this mask. Do not let the picture mislead you so that you are disapointed when the mask arrives.
1,My St Bernard ate through it in one sitting,"Once my dog had eaten a whole in it, it was difficult to freeze liquid in it after that. She really wasn't interested in it in the first place. I just threw it away."
2,A Handy guide for area codes,"This book is most useful for looking up telephone area code numbers. Unfortunately, it is of little real help for zip codes because it works numerically by state without allowing the reader to access codes by town or city names. For example, you can find all the zip codes for New Jersey, but can't look up the correct one for Trenton, NJ."
4,Fun movie,"An enjoyable family film. I've read both ""Life with Father"" and ""Life with Mother""; the movie is faithful to the spirit of the books, and is mostly based upon scenes from them."
3,zebra monkeys,I got these shoes in the zebra stripe (mostly because the price was great and I loves the Monkeys). There is nothing wrong with them and...I don't know what it is but not liking them so much. The heels are not very high. Hoping the look will grow on me!
2,Like an embarassingly drunk uncle at a tea party...,"I genuinely enjoy reading Fraser's fiction and think ""Quartered Safe Out of Here"" is one of the great memoirs of World War II. However, this book is just one extended rant and ends up making Fraser look silly. The few times he scores points it is on easy targets. Most of the time he is simply trying too hard to be a curmudgeon. There is something pathetic about a wealthy white male feeling victimized by modern politics and one wonders, for all his railing against political correctness, if he doesn't have his own sacred cows that he never examined. Still, his anecdotes are funny and, as always, he writes beautifully."
3,So-So Mixtape,"There is only four songs on this 12 song album that I listen to, but the ones I listen to are classic. Some queer from Alaska wrote how people who like this album are suburb idiots, but he lives in Alaska, so screw him. Sure, this is not a H.C.P. classic, but it holds it own. Be sure that if you get this album you are bumpin': ""Murderers & Robbers"", ""Red Rum"", and ""Easily Executed"". For crusin' and chillin' ""Ridin' on Chrome"" takes it. If you have the other Project Pat albums and you need something new, then maybe you should just get a Three 6 mixtape. All in all, it's a alright album, but I wouldn't pay more than $8.00 for it. It's all good though, Pat makes up for it with albums like 'Mista Don't Play' and 'Layin' da Smack Down'. The good songs are all five stars, but the 8 filler tracks bring down the total quality."
3,Triple Six presents...,I really dont like any of the Triple six stuff. But this is OK. That Koopsta Knicca is wack and that volume1-2 is wack. Track two is the sh** thow
1,Cut the crap...,"This is recycled trash. This is old stuff they recorded on homemade equipment and slapped onto cassette tapes. It has no place in the real music industry. If they're gonna sell such poor material, they should drop the price ... because production this sloppy isn't worth [the money]."
3,"Very good, if you already know how to cook",This is a wonderful book to use for special occasions. It does not give you everyday meals but instead you find selected recipes that are surely going to turn out fantastic. I am not an experienced cook and this is the book I use when I have to cook for guests.
5,great book,"This is a great book for any cellist. Such detail is given to the subject that anyone from a beginner to a pro will find insights that will enhance their playing. Not only that, but it is well-written and enjoyable to read. It covers cello philosophy, technique, history, and repertoire. Every teacher and student should own this book."
2,rambling and vague,"William Pleeth did not write this book. He talked, in an abstract, discursive manner, around various subjects having remotely or less remotely to do with the cello, and someone transcribed some of his conversation. One of the chapters was written entirely by the transcriber (and not particularly well) with no contribution from William Pleeth.You may find this book ""inspirational"", if you like vague speech-making, but you are unlikely to find it of practical value. Mr. Pleeth never deigns to consider the nitty-gritty; he never rolls up his sleeves and sets to work."
3,"Slightly impressive, but there's better out there","Burn Season isn't really a metal band, nor are they nu-metal, but somehow, both of those genres seem to come to mind when listening to Burn Season. Opening with Revolution, you swear you're going to get 12 songs of pure metal and screaming, but just 3 minutes later, you're thrown off with the slightly more mainstream rock song Carry On. Burn Season walk the line carefully between radio ready singing and ill nino-esque screaming, but never once cross over into either territory. For now, these guys have put together record that merits at least one listen. Don't be surprised, though, if you find yourself skipping tracks. There's something here for everyone, but for the listener looking for a complete cd, you may want to look elsewhere.Bands like Allele and Revelation Theory have put together better records in the underground rock world, and I'd highly advise giving both of those bands a listen before purchasing Burn Season."
3,"good, but I've heard it all before.................","Im starting to get sick and tired of every band stealing idea's from each other....I dont know, it just seems like there isn't any originality left in the music scene at all. Does anyone remember Flaw? Burn Season sure does.......and they were this bands influence on their sleeves. Dont get me wrong, Burn Season do what they do well, it just isnt that original. Then again, what is these days?"
5,HELL YES,"this is a must for anyone who likes rock music. these guys are the real deal you can feel it in their music,they believe in what they are doing. cant compare them to anyone because they blow everyone else away. take your butt out to a store and buy the cd or buy it onlone here, dont download the songs this group deserves more respect than that, and every song on the cd is worth paying for!!union city,tn"
5,Damn! The good one's always leave...,Love the music the vocals and the lyrics. Love it all. To bad they are no more. Glad Electra finally released their first album.
1,do not read this book!,"This book gives VERY unhealthy eating tips. One of their tips on how to loose weight is ""think like a thin person"" absolutley rideculous."
5,totally cool,Arrived nicely boxed and displays as well on my dining room table as the one at the Planetarium! There's optical illusions and then there's optical illusions and this is one of them.
5,Great optical illusion,Behaves exactly as advertised. Makes a great conversation starter for studying light and optics in Physics class!
2,Can't keep up!,"I bought this without reading any other customer reviews on other sites. There were more negative than positive. I thought it would be fun to try one of Christi's videos. About one quarter of the way through I gave up on the first segment of it. She moved through the steps way too fast and it was very, very dancey, I was very frustrated. I think it would take quite a long time to get this routine down if you make it through the frustrations. I watched the second workout and it looked only slightly easier to follow. The toning looks like it would be easier to follow, I will try that out, but overall I am disappointed in the DVD."
3,Not bad. Good book is Phantom of the Oprah by Gaston Leroux,It wasn;t that bad but I've read better books.By the way the reading level is for 4th graders
4,An adult's look at a children's book.,"The Babysitter's Club is off on an vacation they'll never forget. From their cruise through the Bahamas, to their stay at Disney World, adventures run wild. Will Claudia's secret admirer reveal himself? Will Kristy make a pest of herself the whole time? The first of many great super specials about the Baby Sitter's Club"
2,get the album on scat and even older stuff..let me explain,"this album made me so depressed i almost started crying, ok? i like the pagans a lot, mike hudson's storytelling is a vocal influence of mine. i like the previous styrenes album called ""we care, so you don't have to""...and i feel horrible about brian hudson dying especially cuz i didn't know before, even. i'm apparently just too sensitive to listen to a song about electrocution. a lot of people are, though."
2,Groundhog Day CD - go back and get it right this time,"This cd missed being a good soundtrack by one track, the missing one. The Ottmar Liebert instumental of ""You Don't Know Me"" is OK, but without the best rendition of this song that IS in the movie, that of Ray Charles, the disc doesn't ring true. I like the fact that the Rachmaninov ""Variations"" is included in toto along with ""Phil's Song"". But not including the Ray Charles take leaves a big hole in the cd, where I imagine the groundhog soundtrack burrows back in for 6 more weeks of winter.(The Ray Charles track appears on his CD entitled ""Modern Country and Western Music""-a less expensive outlay than getting the Ultimate Hits Collection.)"
3,Something's missing...,"Loved the film. Loved the music so bought the CD. Still love the music but feel slightly cheated that the best song in the film 'You Don't Know Me' - the most poignant and the one with perhaps the best lyrics for Phil and his feelings for Rita - is just a quiet little instrumental version. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice version, but not at all the one that sweeps you up in the film with Ray Charles's great powerful voice and those wonderful lyrics, and really makes you feel for the characters. So it was disappointing - a bit like going to see the groundhog and finding out he's turned into a squirrel. But the rest of the CD is fun and will have you chuckling as you remember the film."
2,Where was this music,"To be honest, when I was watching Groundhog Day, I didn't even notice the music. It's there every once in a while, but most of the movie is silent. As such, when listening to these tracks, they didn't really recall the music. The music itself is OK, but not anything particularly special - an odd mix of romantic songs and filler music."
5,Ground Hog Day,"Over all the entire cd is worth purchasing just for George Fenton's hauntingly beautiful ""The Ice Sculpture"". That song is so beautiful that it is worth it just for that one song. I am a professional composer that has written songs such as a soldier's song by sylvia desrochers and sgt holly bingham and the hills of yesterday by sylvia desrochers and i believe my taste in music is halfway decent. You will enjoy The Ground Hog Day CD."
4,Reliving the Movie,Great CD! This offers all the songs from the movie. It makes you feel as though you're in the movie with Bill Murray.
5,Genius,"This Cd has a wonderful blend of upbeat funky tunes,Weatherman, and is a good CD to buy as at least one song on it will reflect your mood. It is cheap as well. The only thing that could have improved would be if Garth Brooks or Bruce Willis sang on it."
5,"Milkshake music - best kids music, performance","Lisa and Mikel's are not only one of the most talented children music songwriters, but their live performances are thrilling. They are warm and fun, get the kids moving, dancing and singing, and in the process are giving them some valuable messages (the value of sign language, having fun at school, enjoying life!). My 2 and 4-year olds were singing several of their songs after being at a live concert in DC. We bought the CD's and now they dance, sing, and request them... "" Jump "" and ""Blast off"" are two of the favories, as is LALALA, DADADA, HEYHEYHEY, HAHAHA!!!I strongly recommend the CDs and, if you can, having them come to perform at your kids' school or birthday party."
5,A must for every parent's car!,My 3 1/2 year old LOVED Happy Songs and couldn't wait to listen to the new Milkshake CD Bottle of Sunshine. He already is singing along to ABC of Me and Boom Boom - two of our favorites! If you are a parent and have ever dreaded a long car ride with repetitive children's CDs - Milkshake is the answer -this rock/folksy style is great for kids AND parents! You'll find yourself singing along with your child! :)
4,Great job on technique instructions,"The main reason I bought this was for the technique to create beaded cabochon necklaces and pins. I'd been searching for something that took me step-by-step through the entire process and this book is it. Haven't made anything from the book yet, but the directions are clear and concise and am looking forward to making everything in there!"
3,"Good, but redundant.","This is an innovative look at acting technique, but it is quite redundant. One gets the feeling the author is trying desperately to get a book out of it, but doesn't really have that much info. That said, it's still worth reading, especially for the acting student."
3,Not as good for kids as I'd hoped,"My rating solely reflects this CD's suitability for my 5-year old. While the artists are very talented and this is a good reggae CD, I was a bit disappointed that many of the songs are not true kids' songs, but reggae versions of adult songs. I had also hoped more of the songs would encourage my 5 year old to sing and interact with the music - but he does not like this CD as much as his other ones. If you are a big reggae fan, then I would recommend this CD. Otherwise, there are much better unique kids' CDs to buy."
5,Fantastic - my daughter and I dance to this everyday!!,Great tunes that send us soaring with lots of smiles
3,Teenage Summer Fun U.K. hit from '71,"Double Barrel is the excuse for the album, a big summer fun hit in the U.K. that any youth who was between 10 and 18 in 1971 will remember. Lot's of fun but questionable reggae."
5,An Excellent Collection of Folktales,"Folktales of Okinawa is an excellent collection of folktales from the Ryukyu Islands. Overall it contains 28 different folktales in both English and Japanese. Along with the tale it gives the information concerning where the tale comes from, both locally and internationally. Several stories originated in Japan and South Korea and made their way to Okinawa. This book also provides an insight to the people of Okinawa. One of the best collections of Folktales I have ever seen."
4,A Fairly Broad Overview of Tillich,"Paul Tillich is a heavyweight in Protestant theory, like him or not. This book provides a fairly diverse array of his writings, and a small window into the mind of a prolific and well-known author. Tillich scholars themselves will have to judge how representative it is. I considered it a fair selection, and some of Tillich's writings to be more accessible than others. The selection of Tillich's writings on Socialism is very light, as the editor acknowledges. This book is probably not for the casual reader, so serious readers only need apply themselves to it. I agree with Tillich's liberal and radical proclivities, and he makes a fine argument for the complexity of religious symbolism, as well as a more progressive and inclusive perspective of other religions."
3,Essential and Inscrutable,"I heard of ""The Essential Tillich"" through church and eagerly looked forward to reading it. Unfortunately, I wasn't as spiritually wowed as I thought I would be.On the positive side, I really liked his existence-as-estrangement riff in the chapter ""Estrangement and Sin.""On the other hand, his musings on the horizontal and the vertical mystified me (as in confusion, not sainthood). Overall, I found the themes and the writing to be more dated than I expected - the book has a very 1960's feel to it.I do not doubt that Tillich is an important late 20th Century theologian, but this collection is more inscrutable than essential."
4,Very good historical piece!! Very enjoyable!!,"This was really good. It's about various women that helped shape the Civil War, whether by being Spies, Soldiers, Journalists, Angels of Mercy, or whatever. You'll be surprised how far some of these women went for their cause, and how much they accomplished in that time frame that provided them with so little independent resources. This book is a good introduction into these women, that may trigger your interest to learn more about them. I wish it provided even more information on these people, but basically it seemed to be a book to introduce you to these women and tell of their actions, then go locate more information about them."
2,See if you can find the Leinsdorf recording,"The best performance and not bad recording is the 1968 recording of Ginestera's Variaciones concertantes and Piano concerto played by Joao Carlos Martins with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erich Leinsdorf. RCA 0 SB6784 (12 in., 43s. 9d.). I bought the Lp in 1976. Would be a good re-issue."
3,It was quick but good.,I enjoyed this book it was quick but it told a good story of how Robert Ballard found the Titanic
4,A Book For Children,"I recently recieved this book through the mail from Amazon.com and I am giving it to one of my relations at Christmas Time, i looked through it and found that there was a massive amount of information.For me, FINDING THE TITANIC did not sweep me away to a flood of thoughts."
5,Opinion from a Brazilian Manager,Very good and comprehensive work. Very usefull for the global manager.
4,Ahead of its time,"_The Malling of America_ is a cutting, critical look at the consumerist nature of modern-day American society as it manifests itself in that most insidious, most ubiquitous of institutions, the shopping mall. Kowinski studies how malls operate, from their land appropriation practices to their mandatory tenant hours of operation, to give an intelligent, in-depth perspective on consumer and corporate habits in the US."
4,A delightful collection... (Vol. X of the series),"Chesterton lovers and lovers of poetry in the classical English forms will enjoy this collection of poems by one of the 20th century's greatest stylists, G.K. Chesterton.After a section of juvenalia, the poems are arranged by broad subject. My only complaint with the volume is that it is not complete, and that Ignatius Press has not yet released Part 2 of the Collected Poetry.But you will find many things in this volume in no other collection of Chesterton's poetry, including his poem about Notre Dame football. So if you enjoy Chesterton, or poetry, or both, check out this book."
5,Right book! Right time!,"My son was doing a project on the Welsh Castles of Edward I. This book was the right book for understanding the Welsh conflicts that led King Edward to establish his castles. The book came in plenty of time to be useful, and it arrived in good condition. Thank you for having this in stock."
2,Total Disappointment,"I bought the Wii version of Monkey Ball because the Game Cube version was always a game our entire family enjoyed playing together. Imagine our disappointment to find that the main game is only a one player game, so we can't play it together. The main game is ok, but not that much of an improvement over the previous versions.Like other reviewers have said, the mini games are very hard to control. The adults and the kids became very frustrated playing these games. I'm not talking about preschoolers; I have two 11-year-old boys that can play most video games in their sleep.This is NOT worth the big price tag. Don't waste your money like I did."
2,"Great Idea, Controls are TERRIBLE","Whoever was in charge of making sure the controls worked and could be learned easily by non-Wii players failed so miserably on this game that they should be sentenced to death. In single player, they Wii remote does roughly what you think it should do. It's a little mushy but for the most part is acceptable. Party Mode on the other hand is almost unplayable because the controls are so bad. Besides not informing the players of what the controls are before each mini game, I have not found a game where the controls are intuitive or it is easy to control my character. I played with a bunch of my friends and after about 45 minutes of playing various games, they all considered this game a joke because of how difficult it was to do simple tasks like move their player around on the screen.Overall, this game had so much potential but fell short it letting the player control the game accurately. I'd say don't buy this game."
2,not worth the money,"finished the game in about 30-40 minutes, and the minigames lame, fortuantely I rented the game from blockbuster; still not sure I got my money's worth."
2,Quantity but little Quality,"The main game is decent but relatively short. The big selling point for me were all the multi-player mini-games. I knew that there would be a few throw aways but with 50 choices there had to be something worth playing with friends. Boy was I wrong, all of the games are pretty bad. Many are boring (landing a space ship?), some are limited by graphics (rock, paper, scissors), and nearly all have a truly wretched control scheme (Whack-a-Monkey).If I hadn't played Wii Sports and Rayman first I would have regretted buying a Wii based on how poorly the Wiimotes function with this piece of software. There have been several times when I swore my Wiimote was broken, only to switch back to Wii Sports and see everything acting perfectly. Overall this is a disappointing launch title that not only doesn't do the Wii's unique control scheme justice it actually makes you think its bad (which it isn't)Spend your money on Rayman, its a blast. As for SMB:BB, I'll be trading my copy in."
1,Just not a good game!,"As a veteran of the Super Monkey Ball games, I had high hopes for SMB:BB around system launch time. Hopes that were to be let down in the worst kind of way.This game has to have the worst control of all the Wii launch titles. Using an analog stick to control a board was easy, but to use a motion sensing remote? Good idea in theory, terrible in practice. Some people may call this a ""challenge,"" I think of it more a waste.The mini games are the highlight, seeing as the main game is uncontrolable and generally bad. But that isn't saying much, as the mini games are tedious remakes of all the other mini game games out there (heck, even the Zelda: Twighlight Princess herding game was a heck of a lot better, and not even a ""mini game!""Do I recommend this game? Nope. Based off my experience with it, would I buy another Monkey Ball game? Only if it's analog controlled.1/10 rating. Just bad."
2,What a waste!!!,"I hate ripping items that I spent $50 bucks on, but I figure I need to do this as a public service. First off, I want to state that overall the games are boring. My family played this game on a Saturday night and honestly, none of us had a good time playing ANY of the games. That in itself is a bad thing when you are talking about an 8 year old and a 12 year old with two willing parents. When you are able to make a game where EVERYONE is bored, you should NOT be proud of yourself, but instead you should stick your head in a hole. I am upset that I plopped down my money for this game and I can promise you, I will NEVER purchase another Monkey Ball game again in the future. Do NOT waste your money."
2,Attention Sega: Learn to use the Wii Remote!,"This game had a lot of potential, but didn't live up to it. The one player game is like other Super Monkey Ball games and uses the Wii remote fairly well to control it. Nothing special, but not bad.The multi-player games all look fun, but the controls are AWFUL! Completely awful! After playing Wii Sports we all know the Wii can do so much better (for example, a better multiplayer party game, Raving Rayman Rabbids, has absolutely no control problems). Just as bad, the pre-game explanation of how to use the Wii controls are unclear at best.This game is best avoided. Maybe rent it sometime, but save your $50 for a good game (RRR, Zelda, Trauma Center, etc.)."
4,Good :),"I just got my Wii and I bought Zelda which was a given, and I also purchased Monkey Ball because of the great reviews and rating. The main game is very addicting and very challenging, but I also thought Monkey Ball would be mainly great for mini games and I was wrong. Although I did read that on the IGN review they said if they would have done 15 goood mini games instead of 50, it would have been smarter. Overall, the main game makes this game a worth while purchase while the mini game just adds a little feature so if you are buying this game for the sole purpose of mini games, try Rayman! And yes, the controls are horrible on a lot of the mini games.But I'm still glad I got it, me and my friend take turns playing the main game and it gets really challenging!"
2,ugh,Me and my kid were drawn in by the cute colorful graphics and 50 party games. We figured it'd be a lot of fun with so much to entertain us. But the craptastic controls will make you wanna rip your hair out. It could have been a great game to play with friends if it weren't for motion controls that are either waay to sensitive or don't respond at all. Leave this one alone!
3,Eh,"It's not the worst game in the world, but it's definitely not the best. I like that the Wii Remote makes the game more interactive, but it also makes gameplay somewhat difficult if you're not sitting directly in front of the screen. Forget about playing this game with little kids; they will have a really hard time with the controls. Also, some of the minigames just straight-up suck, both control-wise and theme-wise. My absolute least favorite aspect is how dramatically Monkey Target, which is one of my favorite minigames from the GameCube version, has changed.Overall, it's not terrible, but it's not great. Buy it used."
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with Super Monkey Ball. It has a main game, and 50 mini-games. The main game is quite fast paced and fun, however, it is a little too simplistic to justify the cost of a full game. Supposedly the 50 mini-games should make up for it. However, these mini-games are so difficult to control to be any fun. After playing Wii Sports, I just cannot get used to the awkward gaming experience Super Monkey Ball has to offer."
2,Seems a little rushed.,The Main game is enjoyable- but that is a formula that has been set in stone. The controller adds a new element- and its a blast. However- they are trying to sell most people on the MiniGames- and they just aren't good.I have played a handful of them- and they all control very poorly. Half of the time- we just started over because one of the controllers would go eratic. I hope that this isn't a sign of what is to come from SEGA for all of their Wii games.
3,"Decent story, But dreadful Mini-games","First off, when you buy this game, lets just hope you didn't buy them for the Party/Mini-Games, bileve me, they are bad. I few of them are pretty good like racing or the FPS one, but most of them just don't work right, and get pretty boring after a few plays. The Graphics are okay, Framerate can drop in the space world for some reason which can get frustrating at times. The Story/Single Player mode is pretty fun, The controls added the level of difficulty so if you dont like hard games dont pick this one up, I found it easier to move in all directions by holding the front and back ends of the Wii Remote with my fingers. Music is good but I expected better from a Monkey Ball game (previous titles had great techno music) Overall, this is a decent title, its probably like 30 bucks now so I recommend it for someone who likes hard labrynth style games."
3,"Great for little kids, not adults","My three year old loves this game. He doesn't play the main levels, just a handful of the mini-games, but plays them repeatedly. And asks every day. Worth the money for me, but if I was a single adult, I would probably pass for the $50 I spent."
3,Kind of a let down,"This game is still fun (a monkey in a ball HAS to be fun, right?), but it seems to lack the party draw that Rayman has. The mini-games are entertaining, but just not as fun as other Wii games and they lack the wacky presentation that we've seen in other games like Rayman and Warioware. Overall, it's a pretty mediocre game."
1,Horrible game for te Wii,"I rented this game before buying because I had read so many bad reviews. If I had only played this game on the Wii, and no other Wii games, I would not want a Wii system! Every other Wii game is amazing. The Wii controller does not work with this game like Monkey Ball says it will. Major frustration! If you want a cute game for little kids, try Happy Feet. It has swimming, sliding and dancing that is fun and the controller works great with it.Do not waste your money on Monkey Ball for the Wii."
4,Great Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is great!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone in my family wants to play. It is a big hit at my house. My kids are under 10 years old.
3,Did not like this game.,I dont have much to say other than I did not like this game. I was hoping that it was going to be like Fusion Frenzy for the Xbox but it was not nearly as fun. The controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good. Some people may like it but I didn't.
2,Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz,"The game is just ok. It came with lots of small games, those are just ok. My kids did not enjoy it."
1,Great if it worked,I rented this game for my 3 yr old grandson. He could never play it because it does not work. I thought maybe I had a bad Wii because it was so bad untill I put the sport disk back in. In golf I have only swung the club 3 times out of hundreds. It just does not work. I tried about 8 games and 5 of them did not work. I don't understand how Sega can sell it like this. Don't they try them?????
3,Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz,This game is a fun game. I got this for my Girlfriend and she enjoys it very much. I like to play the party mode mini games although the Controls aren't user friendly. I find that you have to over compensate for how bad the controls work. Some of the mini games controls work fine but others it is nearly impossible to play. OVerall the main story mode and such Is very fun.
1,HORRIBLE,"Only a handful of the mini-games are decent, and the rest are impossible to control, or plain boring. A jump-frog game has so bad controls, you either go all the way left, or all the way right. The main game is fun, but a bit repetitive. Overall, this is a very bad game. Sega should have spent more time on it, considering its price."
1,don't rent it; you'll end up smashing it to bits,"This game is limitless frustration. The controllers DO NOT work. Don't get caught in the trap... even if your Wii is set up perfectly this game will fail to work for you. The only possible explanation for this is that Sega thought you might need a hand getting your relatives to put down the Wii and help clean up during the holidays. Not that you'll really notice at first... it will take you hours just to make sense of the ""instructions"" for each mini game. You'd be better off if Sonic the Hedgehog personally screamed the instructions in your face. If by some strange twist of fate you manage to crack the Rosetta Stone visual directions, you'll be greeted by a stiff dose of boring gameplay; contests that are over in seconds, computer controlled ""characters"" that gang up on you without reason, and a handful of wrote mechanics that hardly pass off as gameplay.Steer clear."
1,Poor poor use of the Wii Remote,I currently have 6 Wii titles and this is easily the worse of the lot. Many of the games are difficult and the controls are very awkward. My children (8 and 10 yr old girls) get frustrated very quickly with this one. I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on this turkey.
5,One of our favorites!!!!!!!,"My kids ages 9, 11, and 14 LOVE this game. It took them awhile to master the wii controller during it, but once they did, they have been playing it ever since. They love to battle the monsters at the end of each level. My husband and I also enjoy playing along."
2,Too hard for the kids - too dumb for the adults,"I have loved all the Wii games so far, so we were excited to get this one for this kids. Most of the kids (ages 4-8) found it too hard and frustrating, and when I played it, it made me half motion-sick trying to roll the characters all over the place. I guess we just didn't understand the premise of the game. I've never played the original, so if you have, you'll have a different frame of reference. At any rate, the six-year old, who figured it out better than the rest of us, still has only played it a couple of times since we got the Wii. Not worth $49, to be sure."
1,3 words... Worst. Game. EVER!!!,"Very boring. My cousins love this game for some stupid reason. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. Go get a different game instead because like someone else said, you'll end up smashing it to pieces because it's so freakin' stupid."
2,RENT BEFORE BUY,Well I rented Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz because I havent played SMB in a while. This game was not to my liking at all because with the wii it is a lot more complicated to manuver with controler. I would not buy this game
1,WORST GAME EVER MADE,"This is by far the worst waste of my money, ever. The controls are terrible and i mean terrible. It makes it too frustrating to play. I strongly recommend you do NOT purchase this game. Youve been warned."
2,Difficult Controls,"My family loves Super Monkey Ball, we've loved the challenge to get to the next level, but this game was completely frustrating. We've played several Wii games, and the controls for this game are totally different. In the mini games, you are lucky if you can get the remote to pick up your movements correctly. In Whack-A-Mole we could only get the hammer to show up on the screen maybe half of the time. In red light green light my younger sons could not get their guy to move. It seems like you have to have percise movements in order to enjoy this game. The main game might be fun if you took a lot of time to master the controls, but who wants to do that? We were expecting a fun family game, and instead were very disappointed. We expected so much more. The Wii format is fantastic, we ended up playing Zelda, and taking turns controlling it. This was a lot more fun! Sorry Super Monkey Ball creators, this was a big let down."
3,Monkey Ball Banana Blitz,I guess the kids enjoy it. I don't see that it is much of a game for the money that I spent. I need to rent the games before I buy to see for myself if they are worth the money. Thank you
2,bummersville,"I have many hours logged in to previous versions of monkeyball on the party games. Friends would always come and waste hours on these severely under rated multiplayer games. So it was a no brainer to pick up this one. 50 games on this version! Sadly, they must have skipped the quality control step before releasing it, because these new party games are unplayable. The wii controls simply do not work. They could possibly work had they taken their time to fine tune them, but they were obviously more concerned with quantity over quality. They even managed to ruin some of my old favorites, including monkey target."
4,Super Monkey Ball,"Super monkey ball for wii is a pretty fun game. Definitely a must to own. It has over 50 games ranging from 1 - 4 players. Some games require nun-chuck, but not all. Games include: darts, disk golf, sheep herding, boxing, jump rope, monkey smith, fruit basket, sling shot, and so many more. This is a great party game. The only down fall is if you don't have enough nun-chucks for multi player, as I only have one. :)"
3,worst mini-games ever!,"this game has some of the worst mini-games I've ever played. some get so frustrating that I wanted to take the game out of my Wii and chuck it across the room, and I've never wanted to do that with any game ever! and I've been playing for over 20 years!the regular game isn't that bad though, and might be worth it to some."
2,Super Monkey not a Ball!,The teens love the Wii-but not this game. Zelda and The Raving Rabbids game much much better!
4,Fun but hard to master,"This is my first SMB title so I had no idea what to expect. Also first Nintendo Console I bought since the SNES. I saw the commercials for SMB on TV and just had to get it for my 4 year old son. He loves monkeys and the way the game is controlled looked fantastically easy to control for a 4 year old small hands. Boy was I wrong. The game is VERY difficult to control and the end monsters are very difficult (for me anyway). I've been trying to kill the second level guy for 3 days now (total of about 3 hours), and still no luck getting the bad guy down half way. As for my son playing he started crying because he can't control the monkey. He just can't comprehend holding the controller forward to go forward. I guess he will get it eventually? He does love watching me play which is good I guess. The mini games are nice, but right now all extra controllers are sold out, so I don't mess with them to much. All and all I do like the game, graphics are bright and colorful."
1,Disappointed by this game,"I bought this for my kids but wound up selling it after my wife and I played it. The games announcer reminds me of late night infomercials. The graphics are very Japanese, very cutesy Pokemon type annimation, which turns me off. Great if you like that, I don't.I could probably live with the above if it was good otherwise, but its not. The controls used the wiimote poorly. For example, on the pointer games, the contoller has to be calibrated every time before playing each mini-game.I didn't try every minigame, but I think there were only two that I really liked of the ones I did try. I was glad to get most of my money back on e-bay before word got out how bad this one was."
2,Annoying Credits Kill the Fun,"While the game is fun the fact that you have to watch the ""credits"" (about 5 minutes worth) between each world really stinks. Wouldn't recommend this publisher again just for that reason. Frankly I don't care who the team who made the game is, I just want it to be fun. Tell me the team when I win at the end."
2,Rent it before you buy,"For me, the games are not much fun. My six year old likes them a little more but says most are ""Boring"". I am glad I rented this, because I cannot see playing these games for more that two weeks."
3,this is so-so it is pretty much a monkey version of the wii play games,There's not much too this we were bored w/ it. This game mimics the other wii play games ect.
3,Average,It's okay. Nothing special. It was very hard to direct the controller to do exactly what you wanted. It was over sensitive. I rented it and I am definitely not buying it.
5,LOL,"Even though I'm in my 20's I still love MTV and that is mostly ridiculousness.I saw it on TV and couldn't stop laughing.When homework is stressful and you need a laugh, watch this DVD!It always makes me laugh no matter what!Buy this and prepare to laugh, ALOT!Enjoy!"
1,Horrible production quality,"Enjoy the show, but the production quality of this product is horrible. Audio and video are not in sync. Some distortion and gaps in the audio. Sending the disks back."
3,Was this DVD made in Iraq?,"I really like the show a lot. The problem is the DVD plays like some black market copy. The sound is really messed up, and I have to fast forward from commercial break to commercial break to listen to it. When I select an episode to watch, the sound will only work if that episode is the first episode on the disc."
1,Disappointed,The show is really funny but the audio on the disc is not so good. I watched the 2nd disc once and now it doesn't play anymore. If it does come on it's like watching a scratched up disc that constantly skips and freezes.
1,hanlon`s compressor handbook review,It`s amazing how little you can get from this huge book!Many formulas in the first three chapters have misprints. The theory sections are poor (just a little more than you can see in a good thermodynamic book). Some figures are blurred and every section has few or no references at all. There are almost no application examples. Chapter 19 (about bearing design) has 152 pages and 36 references (a little too much for a compressor book); chapter 1 (about compressor theory) has only 15 pages and 3 references! Maybe a recall would be in order (following the example of the car makers) removing the book from the market and fixing it.
1,Bad to Worse,Lot of verbage with not much use for theory and calculation methods. I am glad I bought this used because I did not waste a lot of money.
3,Party decorations,"I purchased these inflatable monkeys for my grandson's 1st birthday party.His nickname is ""Monkey"" so I thought they would be a nice addition to theparty decorations. They were very bright and colorful and made of durablevinyl/plastic material. One of the guests actually asked to take one homeas a party favor.Very happy with this product."
4,Cute!,Used to decorate for my grandson's 1st birthday which was a monkey theme. I let the children take one home after the party.
1,Why this?,"Punilux were one of the best live bands I've ever seen and Laughing Academy is one of the greatest unkown treasures you'll ever find. I had to buy this to complete the collection. I've listened to it once and will probably never listen to it again. Compared to their debut and their collection of singles, it is abysmal. All I can wonder is this: with so much other obscure material emerging on CD these days, why not Laughing Academy?"
4,A Good Read,"This is a welll-witten, suspenseful mystery with lots of characters to root for and others to loathe. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."
5,Interesting Reading,"For the odd thing to do some day when it is raining outside, this sure did make some interesting reading on how the box became a big hit worldwide."
3,Some interesting information,"Interesting to see the forces that came into play to initiate and refine the world of container shipping. The author does, however, use the somewhat aggravating technique of jumping all over in time while telling the story."
5,Fascinating story,"Working in the ocean freight industry for the past year has opened my eyes to a whole new world I knew nothing about previously. This book was a great resource for me to get my feet wet and learn about the rich history of something as simple as a container. Marc Levinson writes at a near conversational level so it is very easy to follow and save a few boring, but important, parts here and there, the book was a breeze to read.I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about one of the most important inventions of the past century. It is a history that all of us should be familiar with and even people who are not in this industry will be fascinated by its story."
3,Interesting history,"Really well written and easy to read. You might think this is a boring subject, but indeed, the author delivers a good history lesson and presents political and economic story."
3,No where near technical enough,"Like many jounalists' stories this is set around a particular factor. In this case an entrepeneur who no doubt had a big role to play.But there were lots of other factors which are not given much play and others bearly alluded to. Also, not even one drawing of a container or its fittings!So OK as an intro but by no means a comprehensive history."
3,Not for anyone who doesn't work in logistics,"If you work in logistics, buy this book. It is well worth trudging through the tedious parts to get to the gems. With some severe editing, pictures and diagrams it could be a best seller. But the presentation is more like that of a sterile textbook than popular writing. As someone who worked in logistics I found it interesting. But it is certainly not a book that anyone will read again and again."
1,Oh baby is this dull!,Oh baby is this dull! That's it. Dull. Great way to get some sleep. Yawn! Get it?
4,Kindle edition could use some proofreading,"It's an interesting, extensively research and well written book.The Kindle edition, however is disappointing. Many single words are randomly split into two separate words. Perhaps there were line breaks in the middle of the broken words in the source or print versions? It is really distracting. I can't remember the last time I saw a print book with this many errors in it but this sort of thing is all too common in Kindle editions.Paying nearly the same price for a DRM-hobbled copy of a book as a physical copy, I would hope that the two editions would receive the same attention to detail. Sadly this is not the case."
3,"Decent enough book, but why avoid the details?","I blame a lack of technical, scientific, and mathematical education in the United States. Okay, seriously, this seems to be a general problem with most general-audience books. An absolute inability or unwillingness (not sure which it is) to have any technical details, or anything technical at all, present. Figures? Illustrations? Numbers? Nope. Really, people can cope. And those who can't will just skip past while those who can feel relief at not being talked down to again."
4,Well-written,"A very well-written account of an otherwise dry subject, chronicling the standardization of the shipping container and how it effected and expanded trade."
4,Momentous Change,"There are any number of remarkable historical inventions and technologies that have been, and will continue, to be counted as momentous in the impact they have made to our lives. The average person will never know, or care, about how significant the revolution in shipping technology, brought about by containerization, has been to our existance. That is very sad, inasmuch as our history as a seafaring nation is both long and filled with such events that continue to alter the world's transportation and economic systems. Mr. Levinson has done a remarkable job in recounting these developments. His book is well worth the read by both transportation professionals and anyone who consumes anything that is transported."
4,"Good history, needs illustrations","I'm not going to repeat what the other reviewers have said. It's quite an interesting book. However, it needs illustrations and photographs:* What did the early containers look like? He provides measurements but no picture.* What did the loading cranes look like?* How big were the early container ships compared to today's? He gives container counts but no pictures.* Where was the New Jersey container dock? It would be nice to have a map showing this and New York's docks, so that we could see what additional transport was needed to get goods into New York City.* In what order did containers get loaded and unloaded?* How were container docks different in size and layout from breadbulk docks? He describes but a diagram would have helped a great deal here.* What did the intermodal (train, truck) container vehicles look like?Having more illustrations, maps, etc., would help explain things that are hard to convey in words alone."
3,It is warm but it may not fit,"The hat is soft and very warm. Unfortunately, the one size fits all - doesnt. If your head is a bit larger then the hat is just a bit too small."
5,Lovely things to say to children,"The short verse and sayings in this collection are lovely things to say to children. Simple expressions of love, they are reinforced by the associated images, which feature children. The images are colorful, sure to catch the eye of an infant. This is a book that was designed to be read to children."
2,Only half is good!,Two full workouts with lots of commercials before and after but the third one it's the worst. It shows a couple positions and it jumps to a different workout three times. Horrible!
1,wrong part,"WRONG PART NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE!!!!!Who pays for the part and shiping???NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!NOW KNOW NOT TO BUY FROM AMAZON.COM EVER AGIN!!!THANKS,AL"
1,worthless,"I got this coffee maker for a gift. In four months I had to throw it away because it leaked everywhere. Everytime I made a pot of coffee, only about half of it ended up in the pot, the rest was all over my counter. I did everything it stated in the manual to troubleshoot and it did not help. Don't waste your money."
3,Sunbeam ISX23 12-Cup Coffeemaker,"I owned this same coffeemaker for years and looked for a replacement, found this company and bought the product without a second thought. It seems that the new one, though, isn't quite the same. When I lift the top compartment to place the water, it leaks terribly down the back of the unit. I had read reviews about that same leak but disregarded the comment due to the fact that the old coffeemaker did not have this problem. I noticed the canister itself moves around on the hot plate. I never noticed that before with the old canister. I am a regular coffee drinker and was satisfied with the older maker. Everything is simple, automatic cleaning, setting brew pause, etc., but I don't think I will be buying another one. I am not into all the bells and whistles, just give me my coffee."
1,"Badly written, poorly researched book","Any person knowledgeble about horses would be sure to shoot this book down. Faith does everything wrong around horses in this story. (not using the armpit method to go around the backside of a horse! Riding English on a trail ride! Warning!) This was one of the worst books ever, ever, ever."
3,It's not about Princess Di...,"Just to correct the mis-impression you might have from the prior reviewer - it's quite clear that this book is not meant to have any relation to Princess Diana, it's just a coincidence of title. If you are a big fan of the Princess of Wales... this isn't what you are looking for. If you're big on roleplaying games, however...."
4,Hiostorian,"This book tells one of the hebrew bible's stories that have no evidence. It takes people of myth, superstition to believe that.There is no human being that can suvive that heat of the fire.realistic thinking has no place for fiction."
3,this is okay if you like stats,"for history and tradition on the schools try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" by Chris Warner."
3,climbing photography,"This was a gift for my climber son. He has enjoyed it. It does not have any information about using a digital camera, but he said that the basic information about setting up climbing shots is very well presented."
2,pretty basic,I was hoping for some better insights-to be fair this is an old book-I would look elsewhere for advice on the subject
3,A good read with little surprises.,"I feel that the book was classic Trek. Good vs Evil and good winning. The moral lesson of treating other the way you would be treated is a little dated, but not preachy. I really like the way the newer books are drawing more specific incidents from the shows and movies. The setting on the Enterprise E was good, but I thought the book should have described the ship in more detail. The guest characters were very transparent. The Enterprise E doesnt have good luck with their Security Cheif positions now do they?"
2,Long and drawn out,"It was a boring conclusion to an otherwise good trilogy. Skipped over key points, such as the last battle between Q and O. I was very disappointed. The first two books show promise and this was obviously written quickly to sell the trilogy."
3,A sequel to hold you over -but not great,"This book had so much potential - but fell short in too many ways to describe. Cox takes us on a journey to Tkons past; going through generation - after generation...etc. It's only at the last few chapters that you see that this story is just a tease to lead you to the third book. Too bad the final book will not be out for a while. Perhaps the third book will include more of the Enterprise and her crew - If your reading this Mr. Cox - ""Please do!"""
3,"Strong start at the gate, but the finish was abrupt..","I generally think that most readers who are fans of Q and ST-TNG read eagerly through the first two parts of this three volume series. As always, the author was comfortably able to weave intricate details into a descriptive setting. Alas, for all the rising action, the conclusion was atypically simplistic and dry. If you read the first two parts, you will undoubtedly finish off this third part, but this is far from Cox's best work."
2,Not impressed,"While I like an occasional StarTrek novel, this one reads like a waste of time, and not only because I can't quite get into suspension of disbelief where humandoids normally oversmart superpowerful dieties. I could not bring myself to care for the story much"
1,Pointless,"The third book in the Q-Continuum trilogy is positively the worst.It's boring and incredibly predictable, packed with pointless scenes that don't help the story progress one bit. The ending scenes are discustingly sentimental and full of clish√©s, robbing the book of any credibility and seem to be added in a rush, as if as an afterthought.In short: pointless.If you want to read a good Q novel read ""IQ"" by Peter David and John DeLancie, wich is one of the most original Star Trek books to date."
3,"The concepts were good, but needed to be developed more.","Greg Cox surely took on a momentous project, chronicaling the life and times of Q. In this third installment, I was disappointed to see the plot somewhat disintegrating as 0 mostly chased Q around the ship; there were no surprises either concerning Faal and his son. Still, to give Cox, the credit, he brought it together, made it make sense -even if it was a little thin and disappointing at times."
2,Disappointed,"Well, being a long-time Trekkie (TNG is my favorite), I was quite disappointed with this book. Liked the premise, liked the characters, did not like the execution. This book, the 3rd of a 3 book trilogy had way too much talk and background info for my liking. It appears the author took 1 exciting book and split it into 3 much weaker parts. Profits are the only reason I can think of why this was done."
4,Decent...didn't come as described.,"The product is okay...and like everyone says, if someone wanted to steal your bike, then it doesn't really matter what kind of cable lock you have on it.It is long enough to go through all parts of my bike and still lock. I didn't like the fact that it is advertised as coming with 5 keys, one of which has a light on it so you can see the lock at night time. I was kind of looking forward to that since I do a lot of night time riding and early morning riding...but unfortunately, the lock came with five keys, none of which had a light.I used to have the rottweiler but from a different brand, and it was awesome, but wasn't long enough to take the frame and front tire...and I put a lot of wear and tear on it because I made it work anyway.I'd recommend a thicker lock if you're worried...I wouldn't trust my bike locked up all night with this."
1,Broke after very light use,"Other reviewers are correct about the durability (or lack thereof). Bought this lock in 2007 and used less than a half-dozen times, but something inside the lock mechanism is defective and came loose. Good news is that a simple email to the company resulted in a free replacement, including an upgraded lock that presumably doesn't have the defective mechanism. Other than the defective locking mechanism, the heavy gauge cable lock seems very tough and durable."
2,"Okay normally, mine was defective","This seems like a fine lock for the price, but mine was defective - the locking mechanism now spins around and doesn't open. I like the fact that it came with four keys, but it is a little annoying that there is no physical sign for the top and the bottom of the key given that there is a right side up when you insert the key. I ended up cutting the plastic key body and marking the keyhole so I knew where the top and bottom were and I didn't have to fumble to get it in. Also, the thing to attach the lock to your bike is incredibly poorly designed. There is essentially no way to attach it without it getting in the way of your legs when you bike, at least with my 30 year old road bike. Maybe with modern bikes with fat tubing it would work better. I like the velcro strap that is there to keep it together and the fact that you can insert the end into the lock and it will lock without having the key inserted."
5,Title track worth the CD price,"I have been waiting about 15 years for this recording to go CD. I recorded the title track off the radio around 1996 and kept it on master cassette all these years. A soulful bluesy ballad, this track exudes a sultry sound unlike any other jazz trio ballad I've heard before or since. Very lyrical with ""right-on-time"", bluesy chord changes by John HIcks and a sensual, bass-walking performance by, I'm guessing, Ray Drummond. Guess I won't know who the bassist is for certain until the CD arrives. If the remainder of the tracks are anywhere near ""Lover Man"" quality, this could become my favorite jazz trio CD. The Lover Man track? - a masterpiece."
3,Gives exactly what it says it gives,"This book has good, easy-to-follow plans for creating practical, relatively inexpensive, and durable furniture. It's not BEAUTIFUL furniture, unless you really enjoy the pipe asthetic, but it is well written, and practical.The instructions are clear, the illustrations are well done, the directions are not confusing. However, the furniture is ugly.If you want practical outdoor patio furniture that can survive seven or eight children growing up, and move on to THEIR patios, in all their inbreakable, indestructable-but slightly ugly- glory, this is the book for you."
4,How to Make PVC Pipe Furniture for Indoors and Outdoors,"Just what i ordered and fast delivery. Not as much as i would have like in it, would have liked a little more PVC pieces to make."
3,OLD BOOK NEW AGAIN,I'VE HAD THIS BOOK FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND. I MADE QUITE A FEW PIECES OF LAWN FURNITURE AND THEY CAME OUT PRETTY GOOD.
4,cat and mouse story,"This is essentially an elaborate cat and mouse story. The bad guys are retired generals bent on creating chaos so that they can step in and create their own vision of world order. I chuckled a bit every time one of the characters felt the need to say how awful it would be to have a more orderly world where crime was reduced and rogue terrorist groups were eliminated - the major complaint being something about people being turned in to ""robots"". Otherwise this was a very enjoyable read."
5,It's Just amazing,I read The Aquitaine Progression last week and i felt it was so real and true.Ludlum wrote a story that explains many things that are taking place in our days.It's a story that you have to finish in the same day. You just can't stop.
4,"A slow start, but draws you in so you can't put it down",This book starts rather slow as you meet Joel Converse. He is given an impossible mission to tackle retired military madmen who plan to take over the world. Once they know he is aware of them they make his life hell. The middle of the book where he is on the run across Europe is tremendous. The ending holds up pretty well although it is a little too legal for me
4,Ludlum impresses again!!!,Another Ludlum gem.This book scores with the wonderful element of bringing a bunch of disgruntled old dogs who served in some of the world's top security and counter-espionage agencies who've come up with an Agenda of their own on how things in the world should be.Very interesting characters and a plot to match.However one of the old boys is not playing by the rules...
1,"If you are over 12, Don't Bother Reading this Book","This was the first Ludlum book I have read. I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money. He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot. All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers. Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him? Give me a break. Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife. Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old."
4,Vintage Ludlum,"Terrific pageturner! Is a vintage Ludlum with breathtaking action.I dont know what it is, but Ludlum is better when he writes about war or post-war situations. He goes a little over the top in a James Bond Movie type when he get into modern spy stories.I only have one thing to whine about: this book describes a Europe that is NOT there. Maybe back in the 50s Europe was like that, but surely not in the 80s."
3,It could have been so much more!,"Ok, I am not a mean person but I was very disappointed with this book. The storyline could have been taken to a much higher level. Once again, not a lot of dialogue. But I must say the book made me want to to go to Egypt, the description was very good in this book. True this book was very adventruous and the plot was good but the book's content does not express the plot out very well! bBt it was overall an ok book!"
1,BEWARE!!!!!! Some seeling Compressed bootlegs,"BEWARE!!!!!There are some of these sets being sold for a very low price that are actually bootlegs which have compressed all of the episodes onto 9 DVD's and are the Japanese audio with english subs only versions.Since this was never released in Japan under the Star Blazers name, you can rest assured the seller is selling fraudulent material.Avoid this seller at all costs!!!!!!!"
4,Worth it,"My DVR broke so I thought I'd take the time to look at some of the many dvd's I have in my collection. This set, although a bit tedious in its presentation (repetitive uninspiring music, uninspiring host....), has solid information and a short video clips so that you can sit for the entire session or watch over a series of small periods of time (i.e. if you are watching with younger children). The video format is also user friendly a school environment. I learned a great many details from this set - so many that I've recommended that other people borrow and\or buy it. Just make sure you don't let the presentation style scare you off. It is worth your time!"
5,forever a classic!!!,"I found this cd in store for 2 bucks,its more then worth it.You wont find this CD on mp3!!Every song is GREAT!1,6,7 are my personal favorite tracks on this cdGet this before there all gone this cd is long out of print!!"
4,Books alive,I ordered these books 18 years ago I was happy to find them again. I wouldrecommend these bks to anyone in Early Childhood.
3,Three of the Donovan books,"""Captivated"" is a nice basis for the story of the three Donovan cousins. Morgana's principles are admirable. I found myself giving her a few mental you-go-girls when she lost her temper. Nash's progression to belief was well-written and his trip to the castle in Ireland and his meeting with the family were amusing.In ""Entranced"" I noticed shades of Eve Dallas and Rourke. I didn't think I was going to like this story but I was won over by the the love story and the development of the characters. Sebastian and Mel are an interesting couple.""Charmed"" was my favorite of the three stories. The best parts revolve around Boone's daughter Jessie. She stole the show. The stories within the story were lovely.The supporting characters in this book are very endearing.If you enjoy a twist of the paranormal, you'll enjoy this book."
5,I was indeed charmed!,"It would seem that those that dislike these novels simply dislike faerytales, witches, and magic.If you dislike these topics, the indeed, avoid these books. If however you like adult faerytales, sweet simple magic, and a touching series of love stories then click as fast as you can to download or order!"
4,Another great read!,"While this certainly wasn't her best work, it was an excellant piece. The characters are well developed, and keep your interest, and the storyline brings characters from the other books back."
3,Slightly disappointing,"I am a big fan of Nora Roberts work (especially her JD Robb series) but was left wanting when I finished this. This volume contains the complete trilogy of the Donovan cousins. The writing overall is good but I felt that the storylines relied too heavily on the presence of magic and the supernatural as a substitute for a more juicy plot or character development. The same theme/basic problem was at the heart of all three stories so by the time I finished the final part of the trilogy I felt I could almost have written it myself.However if you are a strong fan of Robert's writing, then you will probably enjoy this book, but it won't be one you read a second time."
4,"Fun read, but the characters are one-dimensional","This is my first Nora Roberts book. I found it to be a fun read especially the context and environment descriptions were good (Monterey). Witchcraft would be more beliavable and more fun if it was a little more subtle. Morgana's powers would sound more exciting if was less dramatic. Anastasia and Sebastian's were good.I have a problem with romance books who characterize the males always in the same one-dimensional way: Tall and incredibly handsome, they all look like a model. I would have enjoyed a more realistic approach."
5,Sensational!,If you like books with romance and paranormal aspects these three stories will delight you as they did me. Nora Roberts at her best. She's always a winner!
4,Truly Magical,"This is a lovely set of three stories about three cousins. All three are witches in a positive way. They use their powers to help find lost children, heal the sick and so on.In each story the person they fall in love with must learn to accept the idea of loving a true witch and in some cases the idea of loving anyone at all.This is a lovely set of three stories. I enjoyed every minute of reading these stories. It is one I will come back and reread again and again. I particularly like how through out the stories, you get to remeet the characters and see their lives progress as characters from previous stories have children and so on.Enjoy."
5,ISRAEL VIBES...LIVE AGAIN!!,"IF YOU ALREADY OWN ISRAEL VIBRATION'S ""VIBES ALIVE"" ALBUM, YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT ON ""LIVE AGAIN."" YOU GET ALL OF THEIR RAW LIVE POWER IN FULL FORM ON ""LIVE AGAIN."" PLUS, ""LIVE AGAIN"" CONTAINS SOME OF THEIR HITS LIVE IN CONCERT, WHEREAS ""VIBES ALIVE"" SHOWCASED A SINGLE CONCERT. SOME OF THE SONGS THAT WERE ON ""VIBES ALIVE"" APPEAR ON ""LIVE AGAIN"" (NO, THEY'RE NOT THE SAME EXACT TRACKS). NEW ADDITIONS INCLUDE ""THE SAME SONG"", ""LICKS AND KICKS"", AND A COVER OF BOB MARLEY'S ""WAR."" IF YOU WANT TO FEEL THE POWER THAT ISRAEL VIBRATION BRINGS TO THE STAGE WHEN THEY ARE LIVE, THEN THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU. IF YOU ENJOY THE ""VIBES ALIVE"" CD, OR IF YOU ENJOY PURE LIVE REGGAE MUSIC, THEN THIS CD WILL NOT DISAPPOINT."
3,solid live album,"since i am actually seeing Israel Vibration play tonight, I listened to this cd a few times to get a sense of how they play live. Well this CD is good but not great. Some of the songs simply are only ok, and the classic Same Song isn't played very well. But all in all there are good tracks like a great version of There Is No End, a strong Rockford Rock, and of course the classic ganja theme Red Eyes. Could be better, could be worse."
1,Death to the Trees!,"Not nearly as witty as its precursor, ""Edna Distracted: Masculinist Perspectives on Declension and Skiing"", still a truly self-important book everyone must read--or drop. Sure to secure tenure."
2,Missed the point.,"NatGeo dropped the ball on this one. It wasn't so much the earthquake as it was the tsunami that caused the devastation. I found videos on Youtube that I hadn't seen before that showed how horrific the tsunami was, and illustrated that it's power would not be denied. Someone should put these together on a DVD. I wouldn't recommend NatGeo's DVD."
5,Excellent quality at discount price,"I bought two 5"" stands and one 3"" stand for under $30, including shipping. You cannot beat that. They have a classic design that gives them an Asian style without being ornate or expensive. I bought them for cloisonne vases, and had I ordered the 5.5"" for the two larger vases (my mistake completely,) they would have all created the look I wanted perfectly. The 3.5"" stand fits perfectly."
5,Legal info,The book was jsut what I needed and at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay. It is in great condition and I am well pleased
5,Simply works!,I have read this book after trying to quit smoking quite a few times with no lasting success.After reading this book I have quit cold turkey and ... now that I think about it - it has been three years since I have quit. The book simply works!
4,electronic chess game,"I think we would prefer a game that talks to us and also a game that is strictly electronic, without the plastic chess pieces which are likely to get lost because they're so small. It's good that it comes with a second set of pieces. One of its outstanding features is that it lets the player take back plays."
3,new trend fractured fairy tale,"In the 60's retelling fairy tales came to TV as fractured fairy tales.Shrek has this ""tail'. Imitations of traditional fairy tales in which red riding hood eats the wolf...Here Cinderilla gets the treatment in a German animation. Prince Charming is Britney Spears as a prince?The butler does it here!"
2,Not Happy!! with Never after,I am a teacher and often use movies to enchance the classroom experience. I felt this really lacked substance and would not very helpful in the classroom. Even my 7 year old niece seem somewhat bored with it.It does have a few funny moments but definitely not a good choice for viewing. There are many much better choices on the market. Definitely wish I had not wasted my money.
1,"Unofrtunately, this was pretty bad.","Happily N'Ever After had a really boring, predictable storyline. The pace moved along really slowly, and it was clear what would happen at the end. The jokes were bland and overall weren't very good. The animation was okay, but not great as it probably could have been. I'm not a huge fan of Shrek, but I'd say you should watch that instead of this. For small children I suppose you could have them watch this, it's more mild than the Shrek series."
1,Boringly ever after,"I usually wait two days after watching a DVD before writing its review. Unfortunately for this movie, I saw Shrek 3 at the theater the day after watching this on DVD. The storylines are eerily similar, however the execution of this movie was much worse. The plot of this movie is simple; Cinderalla's evil stepmother leads an uprising of villians and villianesses to take over Fairy Tale Land. Prince Charming's manservant and Cinderalla lead the good guys and win the day for all.The animation of this movie was ok; not smoothflowing like traditional cartoons, and not pure CGI realism like Pixar movies. The music was plain and forgettable. The comedy was downright sloppy and unfunny. And the dialogue ranged from simple to stupid. I would recommend against spending the time or money for this DVD."
1,A few good ideas DON'T make a good movie...,"Lack of sophisticated animation, flat voices, underdeveloped storyline, and one-dimensional characters. Blah.The movie is only good for one thing: if your kids are sick and running to the bathroom to throw up, but want something to watch before the NyQuil takes effect."
2,Flat and dull.,"Sigourney Weaver is mildly amusing as the wicked step-mother. The seven dwarfs are also mildly amusing portrayed as backwoods militiamen. But I never really laughed throughout the entire movie. The basic concept of having the villians take over 'Fairy Tale Land' is not bad, but the execution is poor. The script just isn't that great and the jokes aren't funny."
1,5 Percent,"Bad, bad animation. Mostly horrible - although... can't help but feel there's like, one really awesome animator/designer at their studio that contributes like 5% of the movie... a couple of the character designs are really cool and stylized.. (like the prince's horse... I think one of the wolves, too; and the gnomes were pretty solid) plus a few isolated bits of animation... other than that it's completely terrible; which I guess I was hoping for something like 'the emperor's new groove' which looked stupid in previews and turned out to be this like cult movie; and so so awesome."
3,It's a great kids' film with a lot of life lessons,It's a little too young for adults like my husband and I who have gotten spoiled by the folks who throw in a funny double entendre or two to keep the parents from nodding off. Definitely a good show for anyone with young girls to see. It's a great lesson that little girls can choose their own destinies and rescue themselves.
2,Happily N'ever After (Widescreen Edition),Happily N'ever After (Widescreen Edition) is a mediocre animated movie that fails to live up to its title. The movie plays on the cliche happily ever after but the plot is tedious and the movie feels long even though it is only a little bit more then 83 minutes long. The music is standard modern animated movie music and the animation feels dated. Had this movie been done 1996 it would have been cutting edge but it was done 2006 and that says alot. I have to give it a not recommended grade. 2/5.
3,"ENTERTAINING, BUT.............","This animated feature is pretty good, but does lack the spark of some of the best animated features that have come out in recent years. The story works better for adults in my opinion as I think some of the jokes will go right over younger viewer's heads. The animation is decent and because I watched this on a HD cable channel, it made it look even better. The colors are vivid and reminded me of a fantasy video game. It's not the best animated film I've seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I rate it just below 3 stars.....2 3/4 stars!"
1,Saturday morning cartoon quality,"Big named stars, interesting premise. So why is this movie so bad? The computer animation isn't the worst I've seen. The voiced acted was okay. I think the thing that really didn't work was the music in the background. It was the same as what you hear on Saturday morning cartoons. Cheesy ""dunt-dunt-dah"" moments. Sheesh! I couldn't wait till the show was over."

2,Not worth paying for,"The good:It had an original plot.It make the Cinderella story more interesting.One reviewer said the humor is like Emperor's New Groove - I think that's accurate. I liked the two sickkick animals.The bad:I didn't get why the guy liked Cinderella. She seemed like an airhead to me.It's kind of obvious how it will end.It failed to deliver something memorable.The animation was bad - seriously not good.Overall, it's okay for a lazy day when you don't really want to pay attention to the bland movie. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch it (free with Prime). It's not worth paying money for"
2,Yawn,"I love fairy tale stuff, especially in nonconventional form but this was just bad. It was boring and the story line/characters were just lacking. I found myself forwarding through parts and waiting for it to be over. It had a few redeeming moments but overall I'd skip it."
5,"necie, loved it","my neice loved it every time she want to borrow my kindle that is the movie she wants to see, so yes this movie well meets my execptions"
2,"JUST OK,,,","THIS MOVIE IS JUST OK. MY 3 YEAR OLD SAT THRU ONLY 30 MIN AND WAS THEN BORED. I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE, SOMEWHAT FUNNY, SIGOURNEY'S CHARACTER WAS GREAT (AND SHE LOOKED GREAT TOO! EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A VILLAIN, SHE GIVES THE ROGER RABBIT BOMBSHELL A RUN FOR HER MONEY) BUT THE OTHER VOICE TALENTS WERE AVERAGE AT BEST. GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE I PAID, BUT IT IS NO FINDING NEMO, TOY STORY OR WALLIE BY ANY MEANS."
2,"the characters of Mambo,Munk, and the Evil Stepmother slightly elevate the movie","i wasn't exactly impressed with thisanimated film,although the idea was interesting.however,it falls apartsomewhere in the execution.i came dangerously close to beingbored.there were only three reasons i didn't fall asleep.the voicetalents of Andy Dick as Mambo,Wallace Shawn as Munk,and especiallySigourney Weaver as the Evil Stepmother.there were a few amusingmoments with Mambo and Munk,and Weaver was perfectly cast.otherwise,themovie was pretty tedious.for me,Happily N'Ever After is a 2/5"
3,"It's ok, but a little boring...","This movie is 'ok', but not as good as it seems it could be...it lacks things, I watched it one time, but that will be the only time...."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,This book did not offer nearly enough real-life examples for thank you letters. Do not waste your money.
4,A Lovely Memoir,"What a lot of nonsense has been written about Pope Pius XII and his role in saving or not saving Rome's Jews. Loy's book is a sad and lovely memoir written by an eyewitness to the changes brought about by the arrival of Fascism in Italy, but it is not a piece of scholarly research and shouldn't be used to destroy the reputation of a man reported to have saved at least 700,000 Jews. Who makes this claim? Jewish historian and Israeli government official Pinchas Lapide in his 1967 book, Three Popes and the Jews. For a credible study of the topic, written by an American rabbi and based on documented research, read The Myth of Hitler's Pope by Rabbi David Dalin, or Pave the Way Foundation's Examining the Papacy of Pius XII, also written by an American Jew."
1,Another false perpetuation,The media seems to be eating up every book that blasts the Catholic Church and Pope Pius XII...here's another attempt to cover up the heroics of the Church during the Nazi era....
1,Student book without necessary simulation software.,"Although it's not obvious from the book's contents, ""Corporation, A Global Business Simulation"" is a course consisting of simulation software, an instructor's manual, and the student book -- what is sold here is just the student book. Contrary to what is claimed, you can do the exercises but have no idea what outcome results from the values you choose. The course sounds like it would be very interesting, but there is no information anywhere in the student book on how to obtain the remaining materials. Don't buy this book unless you either have access to the other course materials or are planning on taking the course somewhere."
4,Nice desk,"In thinking what to write for a review, I asked myself would I buy another one. The desk is strong as they used really heavy MDF board. The only beef I have is that the veneer is soooo thin, it peels around the edges, although it is minimal, but I wonder how long the veneer will stay on.It goes together easy and it is solidly built. The top is really solid as well. (There's a lower price here on Amazon but I didn't check the how much the shipping costs were.)I would've given it a 5 star rating if it weren't for the veneer.Also you will need a rubber mallet to put the molded edges on. You have to hammer it on, and you need the mallet so you don't hurt the finish."
2,Cheap and Incomplete,"When I make the mistake of buying a cheap product that I need to assemble myself, a very basic demand is to have all of the parts needed for assembly. I didn't, and I have better things to do with my life than spend hours of it on the phone, trying to explain which cheap pieces of junk I need somebody to send to me. This otherwise usable piece of pressed-board furniture has now been assembled with screws from my garage."
5,My Chemical Romance ROCKS!!!,Finally some fresh blood in the music industry!! Gerard Way haunts this album! I LOVE IT! It's dark and demanding of the listener. I give it 10+ stars!!
1,Turn It Off!!!,"What kind of music is this. You call this rock? My five year old cousin can play barre chords on the guitar. Guess what, he takes the Southern State to get to my house. I'd rather put my wee-wee in an industrial paper shredder than listen to this album. The worst band I've ever heard!!!"
1,are you in for a surprise...,"well singing a song about d-day is a smart move for the guyz in this band, who better knows the harrowing tale of death and defeat than a bunch of chubby boys in their twenties?on a slightly different note, the music video gives off strangly strange vibes, and i dont believe that anyones grandpappy wants to be in the pants of these pale dumplings, or even has a stiffy for them.can old people even get it up?i dont think so, they dont have opinions, and they only move to florida for the crushing 99% humidity (for their weak bones), for the excellent death metal scene going on there, and to look at wierd spikey plants. oh and i think gereard way is in florida, so all you kids should like go there and stay there. so you can be in one particular spot because your annoying.oh yeah, im pretty sure this cd sucks it too."
3,A new direction for 242,"Many fans of Front 242 were surprised by this disc, primarily becauses it is the first to feature female vocals on a 242 project. Originally designed to be released with UPEVIL as a two-disc set, it was delayed at least in America until after the Lollapalooza tour. Many of the tracks are variations on the UPEVIL cd: Melt(again), Junkdrome (remix of Crapage), etc. Highlights include the aforementioned Melt(again), the Animal mixes, and Modern Angel, which was later remixed by KMFDM. Overall, style and production are above average, but it is not necessarily the best disc to serve as an introduction to the group!"
5,Absolutely incredible electronic experience...,"This album is just beyond words. It really is that good. Everything about it, from the beats to the lyrics just kicks .... It's full of extremely rich soundscapes, captivating vocals and lush, atmospheric sounds. This album isn't what I would call dancey or clubbish, but rather futuristic or visual. Whenever I listen to it, my mind conjures up visions of futuristic cities and vehicles. It makes excellent music to read to or draw/paint if you're an artist.Front 242 is one of my favorite bands of all time, but I don't really care for their older EBM stuff. This album, Up Evil and Tyranny For You is really all I like. I would definitely recommend this over their older stuff, as it has a very modern sound and easily competes with anything else out there right now.I can only hope 242 releases some more excellent material in this vein."
4,Angry guys,"The title is not code for 'cheesed off' but you get the idea. Overall a solid effort, but it fails to live up to past works. If you get only one Front 242 CD, get ""Tyranny For You"" instead."
3,A somewhat patchy album,"Always rated better than the same year's 'Up Evil' album, I have to disagree. Though a much more ambitious and less commercial sounding album than 'Up Evil', it's journey's into sound exploration and harsh vocals are too unsettling sometimes.On this album they seem to be getting more and more into KMFDM territory and other industrial bands, who despite their similarites, have a totally different sound to Front 242.They just seem to be trying to be a band that they are not on this album. I like some of the sound collages. All sweet, sprinkling synths and then drowned out by huge, whailing barrages of industrial sound, but on the whole this album does not do it for me. It's neither EBM nor Front 242 electronics in the truest sense."
5,lava ground,I am not one to write a review about a song but damn....Lava ground is a song that kind of made me have tears in my eyes and I don't really understand why it did that; I don't even understand the lyrics. I guess it just put me in a mood to reminisce or just think about the past. I guess its the melody and the beats that put me in that kind of mood. I would definetly buy the album just on the strengh of the song.
3,oh,"When I heard 'Can't Satisfy Her' I was hoping that the rest of the album would carry on as brilliant. But it isn't. In some songs he just rambles on and on about things, and he always says 'Fire.' in every song. It gets old. I do enjoy the beats and melodies in every song though."
3,A little too easy...,I love doing crossword puzzles even though I'm really not an expert with them. I thought this book would be fun and challenging at the same time. It turned out to be a bit too easy plus it wasn't very big...only 30 puzzles. I felt that the cost wasn't worth the book. The seller was great with it's prompt and courteous service so please be sure to thank them for me.
3,Okay,Not impressed with this crossword puzzle book. It is to large to put in your purse for when you have a few minutes. I was looking for something else.
2,Too few puzzles for the money,I haven't looked at the first puzzle and I am already bummed out. For $9.95 plus the shipping I expected more puzzles than I received. I consided 50 puzzles to be a rip for aproximately $15.00.
2,Easy?,"New York Times ""Easy"" is exaggerated. My girlfriend who is 50x better at crossword puzzles than I am find these New York Times ""Easy"" puzzles hard. Here's how I rank crosswords puzzles by rank. Easy=Masters degree necessary. Hard=PHD required. Sure I am horrible at any crossword puzzle with a college degree in hand, but come on, if my girlfriend can't do ""easy"" puzzles there's something wrong."
1,Important,"dear readers,I emplore you not to buy this horrible waste of a tree. This book is so bad, the author had to write her own reviews and I think that it says something about her that she couldn't even think up a creative screen name much less a creative story. I will admit that I made the mistake of buying this book because I know the author. She asked me to buy it and then review it as a favor. I accepted, thinking, what harm could it do. But the second that I bought the book, she was calling me non-stop and trying to dictate exactly what I wrote. You see, I am book critic for a small monthly newsletter in Seattle. I would just like to say that since I reviewed the book, the author has harrassed myself and my six year old daughter, to the point of tears. Please do not buy this book, unless you are the type of person who befriends bullies, and fakes. Thank you for your time."
5,Complete introduction to aviation insurance.,"This textbook is an excellent resource for those students interested in developing a knowledge base in aviation insurance and risk management. The text descibes the various policies available for pilots, and aviation related companies. It also outlines the many types of risk management techniques used to ensure company solvency. The authors have made a very large and complicated subject into something more understandable."
2,Poorly Edited and Out of Date,"I was looking forward to reading this book because the stories and systems involved with insuring massively valuable risks are so interesting. This book has been a let-down because the very poor editing and clearly outdated material obscure and distract from the interesting subject it tries to cover. The books is rife with grammatical errors such as run-on sentences, comma splices, and incomplete phrases. Some of the information has clearly not been updated in over a decade, and it leaves me wondering whether or not anyone actually read through the book before sending it to press."
4,The Kiss...literally,"I thought this would be different, more romance less, um, nothing. I liked it, but in a different way than I enjoy romance novels. It's more of a coming of age story for Tess than a romance novel. She finds herself by the end of the book, which is great, but if you're looking for romance, this isn't really it. The couple doesn't even kiss until the last few pages of the book, which I guess makes the title correct, but it was a bit dissapointing.*****I want to give it 3 stars, but the computer won't let me."
3,The Kiss,"Only a day before her wedding, Tess Sommerville reunites with a man who makes her wish she wasn't getting married, Will Tremere, someone she once knew and had a bit of a crush upon. Then, hours later, she finds her fiancee' cheating on her, in the church. Will's invitation to call him if things don't work out becomes her escape route, taking her on an odyssey of self discovery and finding love in friendship. However, her step-mother and fiancee' are not willing to let her go, since her defection ruins a business deal. Tess is about to learn who really loves her and who doesn't. Will just hopes that what began as an impulse can lead to forever.*** Funny and poignant moments superimpose upon each other, making this an easy and light, yet profound read all at once. Though it all seems very unlikely and too good to be true, it's fairy tales like this that give us hope. ***Amanda Killgore"
4,Bravissimo!,Mango come al solito soleggia nelle sue canzoni piene di una melodia penetrante. Indiscutibile la sua bravura e come al solito A+.
3,"Great DVD but it is in PAL format, not NTSC. False labeling.",I'm a big OMD fan. I was excited when this was finally released in the U.S. Come to find out however it did not play in my Sony DVD player. It plays on my computer however. After closer inspection with my software on my computer I discovered that the contents on the DVD are in PAL format (which does not play on U.S. players) not NTSC format like the box and DVD says. Beware. It's a great DVD just not compatible with U.S. players.***Review Update*** After a few e-mails back and forth to Eagle Rock they sent me a brand new copy of the OMD live DVD and it now plays perfect in my DVD player. For my troubles they also sent me another DVD of my choice from their catolog free of charge.
2,OMD Live RFSU,"I bought OMD live DVD for NTSC system, however, the DVD does not work on a NTSC TV , but it does on a PC and PAL/NTSC TVPS : on the DVD appears NTSC system"
3,"Fun, but not ""Durable""","Okay, i bought this for my 1year old, she loved the sounds and thats really the only reason she liked it. But after a few months of being played with by my toddler, the sound went out. but other than that it has held up. BUT its very easy to open and if your child is playful like mine. its hard to keep it in one peice bc of the simple ""take apart"" design."
5,Mercy!,"The last cut, hats off to Albert Collins' ""Dyin' Flu,"" will make you fall down and beg for mercy. This is what happens when a virtuoso blues guitarist doesn't have a thing to prove and slips into the groove. Playing that is listening, ear cocked like a hound dog's in the wind, Robillard hearing whatever it was Collins must have heard when the inspiration for this one came to him. (Definitely not the same thing as imitating licks or covering a tune.) Also a plus is that Duke doesn't burden you with overload in the vocals department but when he does open his mouth, it's so right it hurts. In general Duke sings a lil too much for my taste--he should let the guitar talk for him more of the time. The other great cut on this album is ""Never Let You Go"" where again Duke stays mainly in instrumental mode. This man is a treasure when he really opens up on the guitar--worth waiting for!"
2,Not much blues,"Got this alblum yesterday, and am disappointed. Duke is a great guitar player, but this does not live up to what I have heard him do elseware, and is does not have either the soulfullness nor the fun found in good blues. This is, for me, watered down jazz. If you want to hear Duke do some fine blues check out his playing on Pinetop's Boogie Woogie by Pinetop Perkins."
5,One sit read about wood,"I read this book in a single day. It is full of interesting stuff about the use of oak in history, and also some biological information on it. It made civilizations, gave rise to a lot of last names and professions and some of the carpentertricks used thousands of years ago are still used up to this day. If you like books like Salt, this one is definitely for you"
1,N E V E R again,After swearing I would never own another Mr. Coffee I bought this one at Walmart because it seemed like a better deal with all it's features. Right from the start such a gurgling and carrying on just to brew coffee! And it takes so long! I clean it often but sometimes a couple cups of water don't go through and other times it overflows all over the counter. Speaking of counters... my formica counter is now ruined because of this machine. After almost 25 years this machine spewed out something that hopelessly stained my counter permanently. I've never had this problem before with any other stain. I must have been crazy to trust them again.
1,Really BAD!,"Unit became very intermittent after three weeks of use. Warranty is next to useless as there is no authorized service center within 75 miles of where I live; Even though I'm in the most heavily populated area.I'm scrapping it and taking consumer reports advice; Buying a ""No Frills"" unit!!!!!Hopefully; Not made in China!"
2,Disappointing,"I wish I had read the reader review before I bought this book. The puzzles do, indeed, seem to have been ""dumbed down."" After the Atlantic Monthly compilation, which I adore, this is a great disappointment."
2,To much detail,"Moore, told a good story, but when the action would get going, and you start getting ready for something big, STOP IT ALL, with a flashback. At times one would have to reread something just to get your bearings again. Just too much detail, at the wrong time in the story.Loved the bar fight in the middle, but the sewer fight and few pages following with the horse and the gardener, just about ruined the book. i do look forward to reading his next book on Conan, just cut to the chase.-ERIC"
3,Not quite what I had in mind.,"This does not spin quite like I had hoped. I was going to use it for spices in my cupboard, but it does not spin easily if the weight is not distributed evenly. I'm still using it, but it does not work as well as the heavy duty wooden one that I have on the shelf below."
2,Too small for the price.,"It is too small and cheap for the price. Go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to get a bigger one and use a coupon."
3,Decent enough for the price,"Not much to say about this one. I wanted to better organize my kitchen cabinets and these handle the job just fine. They spin a little off center (just a couple millimeters or so), but that's pretty negligible. If they were perfectly centered or spun a little bit smoother this would have been a 5 star review."
3,very very cheap then plastic.,"It performs its function for what I intended.They could have used a little more plastic though to make it sturdier, because it is so really flimsy.The plastic bearing carrier sometimes becomes separated from the top."
3,"With Some Weight On Them, They'll Spin...","I wasn't expecting much from these cheap little turntables, but since Wal-Mart and Lowe's were both out of whatever they sell, I just bought a couple from here. When I first took them out of the box and tried to spin them..nothing. The whole thing would spin around on the countertop, not just the top. I took them apart and cleaned out the track thinking it would help, but it didn't. I almost put them right back in the box to return, but figured what the heck...see what happens.I put one in my spice cabinet to hold bottles... Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce...that kinda thing. Once all the bottles we on, it spun around perfectly. The other one I'm using for vitamins. The bottles aren't as heavy, but it does spin better then when there's nothing on it.Overall, I'm not thrilled with the product, but they're doing what I need them to, so I'll keep them. Until I come across something nicer/sturdier...then these are out."
4,"Work as expected, helping organize my life.","Not a whole lot to say about these, other than they work as expected for the price.They work fine, and are helping me organize my life.No, they will not hold 15lbs and still rotate easily..but they organize my spices and can goods very well. I even use one for my medicine cabinet. :-)Packing was great, and fast delivery as always!"
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,Great product with a greater price-saved tons of money ordering this top quality product-used to go to trivita.com-toooo expensive for same item-thanks for the savings in these hard times-
4,"Small, important, scholarly, historical summary.","This document is a small seminal ""must-read"" for feminist-scholars, midwives, nurses, and witches. This small book presents a powerful history of the tragic loss of traditional feminist knowledge relating to birth by patriarchal religious powers during Europe's dark ages. The book came out of the authors' doctoral research. The historical nature of this book, negates any concern relating to the publication date. I strongly recommend it to eco-feminists, nurses, wicans, midwives, and birth-historians."
4,Classic and worth reading,"For any one interested in women's history and in the real idea of ""total history"" from the Annales school, this book is a must. Of course is not perfect, what it is? However it is time to recover our past, and for that we have to depart from a different perspective, even if it is threatening and contested by some."
3,"Women in medicine ""Witches, Midwives and Nurses","This is a feminist's view of women in medicine over the centuries. It is interesting but out-of-date, having been written forty years ago. The situation for women in medical school has changed markedly. When I was in med school (class of 1960) four out of 133 student were women. Last year when our daughter graduated from med school 56% were women. Women in top positions in medicine has also changed but there is still need for progress. The remote history covered in the book is, however, accurate. The book is readable by both professional and non-professionals alike.J. Garber MD, PhD"
3,Good but tiny,This book was good but I had no idea it was to small. I was expecting something a bit more substantial. All in all it was a good read but I would never pay full price for this.
1,My birds didn't like it,Title explains what I(as well as my birds) had experienced. I think pellets are too big for parakeets. They didn't like it at all.
2,The Origanal Is Better!,"Trust me, the origanal is MUCH better! The pictures actually look like they do on the show, not cartoony. They even changed some of the words such as R which was origanaly ""R is for Rosey and he Great Aunt Ruth"" and THIS one has ""R is For Rembemering The Word""I own neither, but I read this one on the VeggieTales site, and the good one at the library...The Old one is still on here...get that one instead!"
2,Very Disappointed,"From the first 80 pages of ""Flesh and the Devil"" I thought I was reading a page turner that I wouldn't want to put down but then the book just took a huge nose dive after that, the characters became less developed and the story just tanked. It was as if Kola had used all the good material on the beginning and ran out of steam before the book was even half way through.Needless to say by the end of the book I was very disappointed and felt cheated considering all the rave reviews the book had gotten.If you're thinking of spending your hard earned money on this book DON'T...if you really must read this book I suggest you wait for it to hit your local library that way you can keep your money in your pocket."
3,mixed feelings about this book,"What an unusual book,the style is totally new for me, the mix of long term and very short term is surprising, as well as the use of very blunt vocabulary mixed with poetic parts. Very vivid images sprung out of the pages, and I felt I was learning something new about Africa and some of its customs, so it has an instructive side to it. Despite all these positive points, I did not finish the book, the story line was a bit to erratic for me to stay hooked."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"I was fooled into thinking that Kola Boof was the ""next big thing"" when I read all the positive reviews on this site so I purchased this book. What a mistake. Now that I think about it, I find it odd that nearly all of the glowing reviews of this book are from ""readers"" who only have one review to their name. It leads me to wonder if many of the reviews here are being written by the same person.""Flesh and the Devil"" showed a lot of promise at the beginning but the story starts to fall apart almost immediately. Kola Boof had a very good idea with this novel of two Afrians whose love trancends many generations but she just doesn't have the talent to properly execute the idea into a coherent enjoyable story. To be perfectly honest, by the time the story got to modern day America, I had completely lost interest. The characters are one dimensional and the plot is just plain silly. The longer it goes on the more unreadable it becomes."
4,Ryder Rules!,"An exceptional ""covers"" type of album where Serena tackles ""Canadian"" songs in excellent fashion. Her remake of Oliver's 1969 hit ""Good Morning Starshine"" deserves a 5 out of 5 for sheer guts alone (who else could tackle the nonsense chorus and get away with it without sounding like a complete hack?). Every song is a genuine delight. Especially memorable are ""This Wheel's On Fire"", ""It Doesn't Matter Anymore"" and ""Quand Les Hommes Vivront d'Amour"". The arrangements are tasteful and folky (without eliminating a casual rock feel altogether) while Ms. Ryder's voice sounds heavenly (her joy in singing these hits clearly evident). If you've enjoyed recent albums by Corrine Bailey Rae, Amy Winehouse and K.T. Tunstall, then make ""If Your Memory Serves You Well"" your next purchase."
4,Serena Ryder's Magical Voice,"Serena Ryder has an absolutely amazing voice. Her live performances are tremendous and she gains more fans with every show. Her choice of material for this release is a bit odd, and - in the hands of a lesser talent - would be totally forgettable, but she is able to pull it off with her voice, a very tight (esp. Kevin Breit) supporting cast and good production."
5,A talent to remember,I came across her music video by accident but was really taken with her voice so I checked out her website. Her demo songs prompted me to buy this album and I am very happy with it and very much like most of the songs. I think we will hear more about her in the future.
2,"Been there, done that","My first Haddam novel was ""The Headmaster's Wife,"" and it was unique and interesting enough to make me check several more from the series out of the library. But what was different and quirky in the first read was stale by the 2nd time I read it, in this book. Do all her murder victims die of poisoning? Does she always make her most selfish, inept and unlikeable characters (c'mon, the personality of these characters are worse than the murderers!) spout supposedly ""feminist"" rhetoric? I'm rapidly losing interest in this series."
3,Disappointing,"I love Jane Haddam, but I don't love ""True Believers."" Usually, the fact that Haddam is more conservative than I am doesn't get in the way of my appreciation of her writing, but here it did. Justifying the Catholic church's treatment of pedophilia as ""that's just the way it was done then"" really doesn't cut it anymore. The nonbelievers and religious liberals in this book are much more stereotypical than usual with Haddam, and the solution annoyed me so much that I ended up tossing the book across the room. I hope she's gotten this out of her system and the next will be up to her usual standard. If you're a new reader, I'd recommend ""Bleeding Hearts"" or ""Dear Old Dead"" over this one."
1,Terrible Writing,"This book was awful! I was very disappointed. The writing style and plot were extremely amateurish. Jane Haddam does a terrible job developing her main character, Gregor. Haddam took many liberties in presenting her off-balance beliefs regarding religion, the death penalty, and murder through her uncolorful characters. Okay, so she uses a few big words here and there. NOT impressive. The only reason I finished the book was because I paid money for it and wanted to justify the purchase. I couldn't wait until I was finished!!"
3,grammar,"The word ""Episcopalian"" is a noun. An Episcopalian attends the Episcopal Church. There is no such thing as an Episcopalian Church."
4,Little boy's Bugatti,"Seat adjusts and pedals adjust, with 8 inches of length total. Easy to pedal for a 4 year old and enough space to ""walk it"". Lots of compliments on the road. Nice classic car look.This is durable and heavy and feels substantial."
2,Extremely Disturbing Movie,"This movie was extremely disturbing and I wouldn't suggest watching it if you are not a sadistic person.I dont mean to be a spoiler but picking up 14 year old girls, rapping them and killing them doesn't make a good movie in my opinion."
3,Forgettable movie,"The movie itself was well done and reasonably well acted. I simply found myself disinterested in the behavior of a now deceased leaders sons actions. The people of Iraq didn't bring down their leader so they also deserved his offspring. Much like here in America. We havent taken power from our leader despite his ongoing efforts in turning our once great nation into a communist state. So along with Obama we get to endure the growing backside of his skanky wife while she continues to disdain the very country that the President maintains he has legal citizenship with. Gave her a job she wasn't qualified for and literally gave the President a job he clearly wasnt qualified for.In short, our problems made my feelings for the actions of Saddams son unimportant and uninteresting. Perhaps the movies only shortcoming is the presence of Obama and the disaster he has already created and for which our grandchildrens grandchildren will be paying China for."
1,"Amateur Acting, Uninteresting Plot",The acting was amateur and awkward. It's unclear how a story about a warlord's goofy son is supposed to be interesting. As if he deserved a movie about him. I didn't last 20 minutes.
1,Extremely violent and disturbing film,"I had a difficult time watching this movie. It is disturbing, grousome and bloody, very twisted. I would not recommend it, but especially do not watch with children or young adults present."
1,poor poor movie,I am amazed at the good revies this recieved. poorly acted by the lead and no point at all to this movie
4,Amazing acting!,"A little too violent and gory for me, but Dominic's acting really makes this movie fantastic. Esp. him playing Uday. Just superb. As others also noted, the way he played those characters, you actually can't tell it's the same guy and not two different actors. He's that good.Watch it for some great acting!"
2,so over the top....,as to be unbelievable which has the adverse effect of whitewashing the true brutal crimes committed by Uday as part of the sensationalized retelling of eventsby Mr. Yahia.The character development was weak and the pacing tiring. 2 stars for the incredible performance by Dominic Cooper.
2,history,if you like history of other countries then this movie is for you. I really could not get into this movie but they say this is all true what happen over in that country so it is up to you
3,"Often my problem with modern film , not enough left to the imagination","I really like director Lee Tamahori , paricularly his film THE EDGE . I also enjoy several of his other pictures as well . DIE ANOTHER DAY for example . Dominic Cooper is really excellent in his duel role in this film as well . I did have a kind of perverse interest in just how evil Eday Hussain was . I write ""did"" , because now i feel i could use a good shower . For no other reasons than the subject matter and this being a relatively modern film , i completed it but am eager to put the experience behind me . It was a compelling Slog that i'll (outside the horror and thriller genres) be pleased to get some distance from ."
5,Excellent Movie based on Factual Content,"This movie is great! It's about Saddam Hussein's perverted and twisted son Uday Hussein (and stated to be based on actual facts). It is a very disturbing, perverted and invoking, yet interesting movie that will really open your eyes to just how twisted this guy was and also gives a peek inside the mind of a terrorists mentality. It's almost comparable to an Iraqi version of Scarface, but in an extremely bad bad way. Uday Hussein actually makes Scarface look like a very nice guy in comparison. ;-) In fact, if the 2 were to meet in reality; Scareface would likely give this punk both barrels. ""SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!""But seriously, if you like suspense, drama and thrillers and enjoy movies that are based on factual events then this is a must see. My wife and I rented the movie from Blockbuster and I ordered it the following week to add to our library. Very well written!"
5,Portrait of an inhuman entity,"Wow, we see the depths of this mans insanity. A booze and drug addled psychopath. We all know the history of the war, to free Kuwait; the history of Sadaam's 2 evil sons, but this guy makesTed Bundy look like Mr. Rogers. Supremely acted and informative. It makes one sympathetic,(to say the least) about the Iraqi citizens who suffered through this evil."
3,A man is in a man-made prison (hell) and escapes a chaotic evil tyrant,A man is in a man-made prison (Hell) and escapes a chaotic evil tyrant. In many ways this movie is similar to 13 Assassins which is a better movie by the way. But both are similar in the issue that people are in a prison and are at the mercy of a tyrant that is chaotic evil. The plot is to escape that hellish existance. This is a very dark movie but good does triumph over evil. In both movies the plots could have been executed differently to further demostrate the use of free will to escape the tyrant's prison.
5,Great for G-Tubes,We use this no-sting spray all the time with our daughter's g-tube stoma. It protects the skin from leakage and it stays on for a full day. We also have used it to help heal a diaper rash as well as protecting her skin from tape! It is really versatile and we love it!
5,Excellent,Received very quickly.Quality stuff! Spray is much more convenient than the wipes.Will order same from EBDirect again in the future.
3,Reserch Report GOLD,"While doing a research report, i found this book in the bibliography of one other. I decided to check it out. if you're doing a report od Mr. Irving, i highly recoomend this book :D"
4,Dirk Wears White Socks,This is even better than the version I played to death as a child. I love it.
5,true ant style,a lot of these songs are on antics in the forbidden zone. Very good songs in true ant style.
3,Dirk Wears White Sox,"While it's good that the original U.K. version is represented here, as well as 7' single versions, I am disappointed with this release. The remastering process should enhance the sound quality of a cd, not add unwanted noise. Often, when older music is remastered, the person at the controls seems compelled to increase the volume higher than was on the original. The result of this ignorant practice is extraneous noise on the final product. I like my cds to sound crisp and clear, this one does not."
3,bruce does pop,"dart to the heart is bruce cockburn's pop album. it uses more horns and electric guitars(strictly as sound effects, they're never very prominent in the mix)than any album before it. there is also more variety to this album, as it features rockers, country numbers, blues instrumentals and folk songs in separate moments, as opposed to in a potent, stripped down mix. this is both a blessing and a curse. while an interesting context can make up for a flawed song, it detracts from the lyrics, which are normally bruce's stongpoint. in other words, his focus is in the wrong place here. what's more, his attempts at country tend to fall flat on their faces(cockburn is best when he's making music with a little class) and there are no blues lyrics, which is wasted potential in my view. very mixed bag, only for harcore fans. having said that, scanning these crowds is a fantastic song, up there with bruce's best."
3,not really a travel book,"This book was good, but you should know before ou buy it that the only picture is on the cover. Classifying it as a travel book was a bit misleading. This book is a collection of stories that various people, you may have never heard of, have written."
5,A great collection,If you didn't pick up the first 3 Garfield titles when they were released in the large format full color then this is a must have for any Garfield fan. You get many cartoons for your dollar.
3,mixed results,I got this for my 2 kids. 1 of them likes to watch it periodically while the other one doesn't like it at all. These old cartoons don't seem to get the response that the newer Pixar movies do. My kids absolutely loveToy StoryandToy Story 2You get more for you money from the Pixar movies.
3,funny but not creative,"Garfield can be very funny or it can be very stupid. This comic is just jokes, jokes, and more jokes. Most people want more than jokes they want someone is creative like ""Bill Waterson, Calvin and Hobbes"" which is funny and creative, and ""Gary Larson which is funny and random"". The older Garfield are good but the brand new ones are terrible, Jim Davis is running out of ideas. I'm not reviewing only this book but all the Garfield comics made. Hope this review was helpful."
1,Buy another study guide,"I bought this book the week before my test, to get in a little bit more practice. There is really only one test in the book, that covers all five areas of the test. The questions in this book were not in the same format as the actual PCAT test. Some of the questions were bizarre, too. There was a lot of information on pharmacy careers, but you can get that on the AACP web site. Save your money and get another book."
2,What you don't know,"I believe that this book provides you information on what you do not know. By taking the practice test, you can pinpoint the subject areas in which you are lacking. However, if you want a book that will help you review material on these subject areas, you will need another book (or two). The practice exam was helpful though. However, I stil have not taken the PCAT so I can't tell you how helpful it is."
4,SIDESPLITTING COMEDY!!!,"This movie was truly awesome! It is so hilarious, it will definitely make you laugh uncontrollably! I have never a seen such a great comedy. This is now my favorite movie. Paresh Rawal, of course, gave another brilliant performance. Akshaye and Aftab also were terrific. It is really funny how all the characters have some connection to each other and how continuous misunderstandings among these 26 characters lead to absolute chaos! Whoever wrote the script for this movie is a genius. The movie also makes fun of cliched Bollywood scenes. If I could, I would give this movie an 11 out of 10. This is one comedy you cannot afford to miss!"
2,"Helpful, but full of mistakes, incomplete answers","This guide drives me crazy. There are so many mistakes here; I've spent hours on some problems trying to figure out the problems only to find out in the end they goofed! Shame, shame. Answers are also often incomplete and poorly presented. It isn't a complete wash so I gave it two stars."
3,$17.99 is a good price for more hearts,"This is the other cast aluminum, Berndes pan that is on sale for $17.99 from $25.No recipes in German and Italian came with this pan. The recipe booklet that came with my loaf pan has a recipe for an Almond Cake with Chocolate glaze for this shape.Must hearts be restricted to Valentine's Day?"
5,The poetic visual!,"The lavish style of Cocteau is carved in relief with his first feature, imbued into the great surrealistic mainstream. 1930 marks not only the auspicious debut of this renowned poet, but it will be reminded as the most imaginative decade of the Century in which surrealistic proposals concerns: Bunuel would dazzle the entire world with ""An Andalusia dog"", ""The gold's age"" or ""The Hurdes"" and Einsenstein was in the eve of Viva Mexico and Dizga Vertov with his eye-camera proposed his experiences.And being the first Op of a genius, there will be food for thought respect the forthcoming projects specially Orpheus and Orpheus' testamentIndispensable in any collection of every hard fan of the cinema and for all those connoisseurs of the cinema."
2,Watch out for bleeding,"You can see the warning about aspirin therapy and policosanol. This stuff acted like a blood thinner on me and I do not take aspirin. I only took one tablet a day and started getting nosebleeds. When I stopped taking it, the nosebleeds stopped. I'm not saying this will happen to everyone but you do need to be aware of the potential problem. I would certainly not take this stuff within a couple of weeks of having any surgery."
4,Classic Charlie Daniels at his best.,"This is Charlie Daniels at his very best. While listening, a lot of happy memories of the seventies came back."
2,A Poor Reading,"This reading of ""Black Orchids"" by Saul Rubinek is WAY to fast. He literally races through the text, probably in order to make the reading fit on two sides of a single cassette tape. Also, his rendition of the various characters is lacking in finesse. For MUCH better readings of the Nero Wolfe stories, see Michael Pritchard."
4,Black Orchids,"I ould give this five stars but, there two stories to this book. I have finished the first story which was okay, but not great. I will know more after after the seconf story."
1,Why bother?,"If, somewhere, deep within the tortured bowels of this book, there is a central thesis that could be stated in a few short sentences and comprehended by most educated English-speaking peoples, I have yet to find it. Endless restatement, obfuscated in painfully cultivated strings of verbiage, of trivial fact is used to document an hypothesis that if stated clearly could be supported or refuted in about a page-and-a-half and then likely consigned to the graveyard of such endeavor. The prose is a true caricature of Derrida's; the logic is a laTour de force. Typical of such works, the author begins with a premise and then selectivley seeks textual support. Of course, such an approach can be conveniently utilized to support any premise and if written with sufficient opacity will pass for scholarship and great insight.The book is an unreadable bloody bore; its value is restricted to its caloric content relative to the market price of a barrel of Texas sweet."
5,Watch for more!,"The story ""Sitter"" was my favorite in this collection. Hoffman is a gifted writer and I hope to see more from him soon. Well worth the purchase, find it any way you can!"
3,A Blue So Blue,"This was the perfect book for a daughter who is also a mother whose eyes are so blue, but the story was marginal. I would not buy it for my grandchildren, it wasn't entertaining enough. The pictures would appeal to adults more than children. But for my purposes it was perfect."
3,"Good, but with reservations","Gisteq and its software work very well. The gps aquires satellites quickly, even indoors. The software imports photos and matches them with the tracks from the gps very well.Seeing the photo locations displayed on a map is a real kick. And that is the one week point in the system. It can only dispay a map if you have and account with google, ok that is free, for now, and only while your connected to the internet.There is no map display available without an active internet connection. An option to use some other map source would greatly improve the usefulness of the Gisteq system."
2,Very bad Software...,"I've just purchased this, and will be returning it.The hardware is great (I don't even mind the flashing lights, which you can't see in sunlight anyway). It will sync itself within a reasonable time, and the auto shutoff feature is great.The problem is the software simply doesn't work for me. Having set the time on my camera as instructed, it insists on thinking that the tracks are 8 hours ahead (which I suspect is GMT!)... the time on the photos is correct, and when you view the tracks they're correct as well. The issue only comes up when you try and geocode your photos (isn't that the sole purpose of this device!?). There seems no way to resolve this.Don't bother to try and contact their Tech Support. If you call them, you're told to email. If you email them, you will never get a response (1 week and counting!). Their Tech Support Forum is basically a porn site, and contains no useful information."
2,Not there yet,"Great idea but the software doesn't work well on a Mac and it's difficult to get the time stamps to sync with the camera if you're shooting a lot of photos. This means that locations don't match exactly with the photos. Also, the software repeatedly crashes and log files seem to get corrupted easily. Can't wait for GPS chips to be built directly into cameras (with no external attachments). What's holding things up with Nikon, Canon, et. al.?"
1,GiSTEQ Phototracker,"Took GisTEC to China with me , but it was totally useless since the date would not change to the correct date after satellite sinc."
3,Soul Searching,"I am a fan of D.H.'s and even I found it difficult to feel the soul in Soul Alone. It was too pop sounding for the title. I was hoping for a break away from he & John's sound (even though I love Hall & Oates). Marshall McLuhan said, ""Art is anything you can get away with."" Well, he does that this time. I'm sure of one thing in listening to this CD... Daryl was searching. You can hear it. That's a good thing, right? He is an artist that's still on a quest. That's the best we can ask of him."
4,GOOD SOLID DISC,THIS Album Sounds Really Good.Daryl Hall SOunds Really Strong Here.THe MUSIC&Writing is Good as well.His Voice still SOunds strong.
4,"An Avid Fan Of Blue, Black, Brown Eyed, Any Kind Of SOUL !","I, too, dismissed this cd when it first appeared 10 years ago,thinking it was too bland or commercial-soul(less) and sterile. It felt as though Hall was not taking enough musical risks and was playing strictly by slick production numbers...what a difference 10 years makes ! Hall delves into the light weight sound of early hip hop in a few of the opening tracks and then progresses into some blue-eyed soulful grooves with songs like the laid back Borderline and the melodious and infectious Stop Loving Me, Stop Loving You, the r&b funky tune Money Changes Everything. Hall's vocals and falsetto are strong and pack a wallop ! This solo project is casual groovin' blue eyed soul at it's best ! ..."
3,"Weakest Solo Album, Still Good","released in '93, 7 years after 3 hearts...daryl changed his sound, not for the better.Although Daryls BEST song is here ""Written in Stone"" ..the opening ""when we kiss that way...I search for words that might explain"" takes your Heart away!the single ""i'm in a philly mood"" is a soul ballad and is not impresive. ""stop loving me, stop loving you"" is the other single and is a nice sweet song, but nothing special either.The B side to ""i'm in a philly mood"" is better ""Money Changes Everything"" comes closest to a rock song and almost delivers, (the woman moaning in the back ground Doesn't help any).alot of the material is Limp, daryl does a better ""soul"" album with ""Can't Stop Dreaming"" and is worth its weight in gold. This album is great for ""Written in Stone"" , that would be the main reason to buy this album."
5,VERY SOULFUL!,"I've been a fan of Hall & Oates music since I was in high school in the 70's. After recently seeing them on A&E's ""Live By Request"", and hearing Daryl Hall sing his heart out, and puts his soul into every song, I wanted to hear more of his solo projects since I only had one of his cd's. This CD DID NOT disappoint me! Still soulful, but a quieter soulful sound. It's amazing how he can make his voice sound SO different! I think he is amazing!"
5,Tyrus is Terrific,"Patrick Creevy is an excellant writer. He is able to make the reader actually feel emotions, especially the pain and anguish that Ty Cobb experienced as a major league rookie.This book is not light reading but without question is well worth the effort. After reading some sentences and paragraphs, I paused, astounded at Creevy's insights and his writing ability. I wondered how he thought of what I had just read. I particularly liked the trial of Cobb's mother. Rather than simply describing the process and the testimony, Creevy captured the emotional roller coaster of examination and cross-examination. I highly reccomend this book."
4,"Worth picking up, baseball fan or not",I was very pleased with the story and the style of writing was unique without being difficult. As a yankee in the south I found the thoughts of young Tyrus interesting. The baseball situations in the book are very well written and the description of Detroit on the advent of the automobile even more so...like I said worth the read.
2,warning: Historical Fiction!!,"I bought this book thinking it was a biography on Ty Cobb. It turns out, it's historical fiction, based on 1 year from Cobb's life, when his father died. Now granted it may be well researched, for that one year, but, it's still fiction..."
1,"Sure the food is tasty, but ...","I bought this book as a gift for someone else, and was very disappointed in the content and quality of the book once it arrived. The book appears to advertise using one particular kind of tofu, which may or may not be widely available. I was uncomfortable giving it to someone who may not be able to buy that brand in their local store. The perils of online shopping, I guess."
4,tasty tasty,"I only recently decided to become vegetarian and bought this book based on some of the reviews I had read. Its a great book! I wasn't much of a tofu fan prior to this but there are some really inventive recipes in here. Its written I think by the makers of the brand Mori-Nu Tofu b/c its listed by brand in each recipe and if I had known that I may not have bought the book but let me tell ya, they know tofu. The recipes are good - especially for someone new to cooking w/ tofu. They have a whole front section dedicated to different tofu cooking techniques and tips. Each recipe has tips on serving ideas as well"
4,"Reader-friendly, entertaining w/delicious ecclectic recipes.","I never knew tofu could be so exciting and delicious. Akasha's comments after each recipe make this cookbook very personal and real. I have tried 6 or 7 of her recipes and every one turned out great...a far cry from many previous tofu recipes which tasted so blah and ""diet-food like."" I also enjoyed the various tips on how to use tofu instead of... A great little book to keep handy."
3,"Should be renamed ""The Art of Mori-Nu Tofu""","The recipes are good, but it is so annoying to see the words ""Mori Nu"" in bold on every page. As a matter of fact, Mori Nu tofu is one of the worst brands of tofu out there. Was this book written by them? If so, very misleading bias endorsement. Buy the book, but stay clear of Mori Nu."
5,Good guide,"We actually borrowed this book from a friend and ended up leaving it on the train by accident. We felt bad for losing the book because it has a lot of valuable information in it, so we bought this as a replacement for the one we lost. Would definitely use the book again if I went back to Prague!"
4,DK Prague Guide,"The DK books are always very detailed in the maps and cut aways of the main tourist areas. Information and photos of parts of the insides of museums, churches, castles, et al., give good indication of what you will see. We do not use them for the restaurant and lodging information, as other sources (Rick Steves, internet), seem much better. We have purchased DK books for several trips and have been very satisfied."
4,Have a nice trip,"This guide is very useful to plan a trip,you can learn abouthistory and geography of St.Petersburg, the weather during theyear, the most importants festivals, you can see photos andmaps of museums, palaces and another atractions.You can learn about safety, healthcare, currency, food andlodging.I've used this kind of guide allways when I travel abroad, butI think the book is heavy to carry all the time, usually I studythe guide in the hotel before leave to an atraction.Other problem is that the hotels indicated by the guide usuallyare more expensive than hotels I can find in the Internet, butto plan a trip this is the most wonderful guide, even for students to learn about a country or city is amazing.Maria Aparecida Sanchez from Brazil"
5,Comprehensive and Fabulous for Prague,"This book blew my mind. Before departing, it helped excite me about the people, history and art of the Czech Republic. Upon arrival, it served as the most perfect guide to Prague. From exquisite must-do walks to the breakdown and illustration of statues along the Charles Bridge, it covered everything worth seeing in Prague. Because of the precise maps and excellent directions, my friends and I were able to cover historic Prague in 4 days, visiting every site that we wanted to because we had such an excellent device for orienting ourselves. I would highly recommend this book to any traveler who loves to understand the history and artistic intricacies of a region. I plan to buy Eyewitness Travel Guides for all my future adventures."
4,Great coverage of central Prague,"The sights of Prague's city centre are listed and described with the aid of photos in this beautiful book. The coverage of the city centre is comprehensive, but slightly weaker when talking about Prague's suburbs and the surrounding countryside. Well worth your money!"
3,"Wow be unto a band who replaces members, upset fanboys can be so cruel","Short and sweet: musically this thing rocks, lots of fast thrashing punk rock a few funkier numbers and some reggae for that palette cleansing effect. This is nothing that the Brains didn't do on previous and subsequent albums and sonically Rise is tight and powerful. Drummer Earl Hudson is absent and not really missed as far as I'm concerned. Mackie Jayson ex of the Cro Mags is a more than capable replacement, sorry Earl. However Joseph I is in no way H.R. and this is why I'm sure this album gets slagged. Joe does his best and I suppose that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and all that, but he just ain't the real thing vocally nor lyrically. Thank Jah H.R. decided to rejoin because the Bad Brains absolutely needed his peculiar form of front man insanity."
1,Bleh!,"As I have been reading these reviews I keep asking the same question, ""Are they talking about the right album?"" I don't get it. I love the Bad Brains, they easily make my top 3 of all time favorites, but I can't find anything good about this album. And trust me when I say this, I tried SO hard to find anything remotely good about this album. It just isn't there. I would highly recomment to anyone who is considering this album to stay far away from it."
1,Not Bad Brains folks.,"""Rise"" is a textbook case of former members of a group using the name of their now-defunct band to cash in on that name. If some members of Bad Brains wanted to record an album without founding members ( of course most notably HR ) they have every right to. It's when they use that beloved band's NAME to promote the product that fraud has been perpetrated on their fans. After Ian Curtis' suicide the surviving band members continued to record with the NEW name New Order. That is simple ethics. If they recorded under the name Joy Division without Ian Curtis that would have been less than righteous.Besides the questionable morality here, the music on this album just is not very good. At all. Stay away. There are many great ""real"" Bad Brains albums out there to enjoy. To name a few, try ""Bad Brains"", ""Banned In D.C."", ""I Against I"" or ""Black Dot""."
1,Don't buy This. This is BAD BRAINS in name only,This album is terrible. Bad Brains don't exist without HR and HR is absent here and thus album is terrible. The new singer is just a terrible impersonator and he cna't cut it. The songs lack the energy and power of previous releases and even more they just aren't good. The only positive to come out of this whole thing is that Bad Brains realized they aren't Bad Brains without HR and thus re-formed.
4,"Solid Effort For The ""#1 Crew"".","I wasn't expecting much from ""25 to Life"" because most crew albums tend to be lackluster. But I liked all of the T.I. & P$C ""In The Streetz"" mixtapes so I figured I would enjoy this as well. Some of the beats are a little repetitive, but overall, the production is pretty good. While T.I. lyrically outshines his brethren on this album, Mackboney is impressive on several tracks and Big Kuntry holds his own. My favorites are ""25 to Life"" (nice bass-heavy banger to start this album off), ""Walk This Way"" (smooth production and vocals from Cee-lo), ""Lookin' Shife"", ""Comin' Down""(sounds like it could have been on UGK'z ""Ridin' Dirty"" album) and ""#1 Crew"" (dope beat and nice use of an Ice Cube sample). This album is kind of in the same vein as the Boyz N Da Hood album released earlier this year, but IMO, ""25 to Life"" is better."
2,T.I crew is just not what I thought it was gonna be,T.I and the pimp squad clicks recent release was not a good cd. T.I is the only rapper in this group with any solo skill.
3,25 to Life The Album,"This Wasnt All Hot But Still A Good Album!!1.25 to Life - 5:00 5/5 Good Starter, Love The Beat!!2.Westside - 4:44 2/5 Bad Beat!Good Lyrics Tho3.F**k Where Ya From - 4:17 1/5 Bad Song Overall!!4.Do Ya Thing - 4:26 5/5+ One Of My Fav Songs5.Walk This Way - 4:22 3.5/5 Good Beat, Nice And Slow!!6.I'm a King - 3:32 5/5 Sucks That Lil Scrappy Wasn't On This One7.Like a Movie - 4:09 5/5+++ Gotta Be My Fav!!

5,"Yes, I'm proud to be Dutch","Great Album of a great Dutch Band, it's good to know that they've done well in the USA. Because I'm Dutch, each of these songs bring out some nice memory's :) Over here, you grew up with the Earring, they were just always there."
5,POWERFUL INSIGHT AND FORESIGHT IN PROPHETIC POWER,"PROPHETIC POWER IS INDEED VERY POWERFUL IN IT INSIGHT AND FORESIGHT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE READING OF PROPHETIC POWER FOR ALL BELIEVERS. THE KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED IN IT WILL HELP BELIEVERS AVOID GREAT MISTAKES AND PITFALLS WITH THE PROPHETIC MINISTRY IS CONCERNED. PROPHET KERVIN SMITH IS SPOT ON HIS WRITINGS AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST.WAYNE, IN HENDERSON, NEVADA"
2,One good song album + a lot of [stuff] !!!,"""Divine"", is the only reason I'm keeping this CD. Forget about the rest, a bunch of ballads and experiemental songs like ""Father"" ( what a waste ! ). I just hope the next Stratovarius album won't be as bad as this solo project."
1,Avoid like the plague,"If you like good heavy rock music, or even music in general, stay far away from this cd. Timo carries over absolutely nothing that makes Stratovaius a great band. I have a very wide range of musical tastes (not just harder! faster!), but this solo cd is all weak pop songs, that feature nothing interesting or worth listening to. So, save your money for something else."
1,What was he thinking?!,"What on Earth was going through Timo Tolkki's head when he wrote this piece of garbage. Nothing about this album has anything to do with the true reason Tolkki's in the music biz (which is, of course, Stratovarius!) Tolkki is a great guitarist, but this puts his skills as a musician to utter waste. Instead of an album in the classic style of Stratovarius, we get bland, boring, completely un-metal pop! And I don't mean a la Motley Crue! I mean the f***in' Police, who are fine, but not what Tolkki should have done! Also, what a waste to have Michael Kiske and Sharon Den Adel (two more excellent metal voices) sing on two tracks. I will say this, though, it's great to have the original Strat keyboardist, Mika Ervaskari, back with Tolkki, but that's about it. Avoid Tolkki's horribly un-metal solo stuff at ALL COSTS, and stick to Stratovarius or Kotipelto (the solo project of the OTHER Timo in Stratovarius.)"
5,Passion Play 2000,The Passion Play 2000 arrived as stated and quickly. I wanted it to compare to the new 2010 one.
4,Good purchase on a not so common book..,"Initially shipped the wrong item, but seller corrected issue quickly. The correct product arrived in ""as advertised"" condition. Nice Book.Honest seller."
1,It doesn't work!,"After reading the 5 star review, I bought 2 pairs. It germinates; however, the tender thing dies after germination no matter what I do. Not recommended."
4,Updike is one of the great American Writers,"Rabbit Run is a great American novel and the best part is Updike got better as time went on. It shows in Rabbit Redux. He writing is clearer and the story grabs you right away. The rebellious Harry becomes the sad, over-weight man at 36 going on 60. If someone loves to read a good book or is thinking about a career in writing they need to read these novels and see if they can even come close to Updike. If not, keep your day job!"
1,Rabbit Run,"I bought this book for a book club I am in. After reading about 20 pages of it, I had to stop. I really did not enjoy reading this and felt I could use my time to do just about anything else, including cleaning the bathroom, and get more out of it. This is unusual for me as I usually love anything I read. If you don't like depressing stories with unlikable characters, don't get this. On the one hand, I do not think reading only 20 pages gives me enough information to provide a fair review, however, only one person in our book group liked it."
1,Does not work,"The Lincoln Lubrication G110 Mini Pistol Grease Gun I received does not appear to work. The instructions sorely lack illustrations. You need to insert the grease tube in ""just right"" for the grease to be pushed from the tube into the gun head. The grease does not seem to find its way from the gun head to the grease fitting that is supposed to receive it. I don't know if this is due to a lack of pressure or something other reason. There is no phone number to call for help. My recommendation: buy another brand."
4,Ahoy There Mate! Pipe me On Board!,The Grand Puba (that's Mister Puba to You!) loves Francis! These videos really are great if you are in to family fare! Something that you can let the kids watch without fear of comprimising your values. If you liked Mr. Ed - you'll love Francis! Barney? Ppphhorgetaboudit! Get Francis instead!
1,Do not order,"Do not order this item! It does not come with a plastic case as one reader says it did. With all the issues with Lithium Ion Batteries, it is extremely important that spare batteries be stored in a plastic case. Item is not UL approved either."
5,Digipower BP-PN07 Replacement Li-Ion Battery for Panasonic CGR-S007A,My wife lost one of our spare Panasonic CGA-S005A/1B Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Batteries. This Digipower BP-PN07 Replacement Li-Ion Battery for Panasonic CGR-S007A was the wrong battery. I finally ordered the correct replacement and it works perfectly.
3,No endurance,"I bought this battery because reviews said this camera has a fairly short battery life. I'm glad I did because they were right.This battery, however, has extremely short battery life. I have had terrible luck with it losing its charge over time. Even when I use it fresh off the charger, it would be a stretch to say it lasts half as long as the original battery.This battery is basically an emergency backup to let me wrap up what I'm doing and recharge the original battery."
3,My review of The Children's War.,"The Children's War is a good documentary about the effects on children in Northern Uganda from the atrocities of Joseph Kony's LRA (Lords Resistance Army). The LRA had been abducting children for about 23 years and turning them into Child Soldiers or Sex Slaves. This documentary provides some information not previously known on this matter and expands some widely known information. For anyone who has an interest in the subject of Child Soldiers or Sex Slaves. Mostly this documentary casts light on the Night Walkers, the children who commuted many miles back and forth daily to Gulu City to sleep safely and not fear abduction by the LRA if they stayed at their homes. This isn't an exciting documentary but it's good and pertinent to the effects the LRA had on the children in Northern Uganda for 23 years. It has my recommendation and I recommend Amazon.com as a trusted and reliable source."
1,Realizing Reality,"Please if you read this review do some research and you will realize that this movie is war propaganda to try to make it seem necessary or acceptable to go to war in uganda if you have any concern in or future you will research and try to do what you can to spread the word of this. As you may or may not know all of this but we are in war in iraq,afganistan,siryha,libya and soon iran and now uganda... all these places have oil and all these places are not a threat to our national security well i could go on and on but i wont check out alex jones, ron paul, and fox news caught for starts and maybe you will see this isnt a movie for entertainment or for education of how terrible it is over there its to promote war..."
4,good food for all diets,"Ms. McGary's Healthy HomeStyle Cookbook is a great resource for healthy diets. Her recipes are flavorfully made using whole ingredients with less fat and sugar than standard versions. They are easy to make, practical for busy people, diabetic or not. Nutritional profiles are included with each recipe. McGary's book of recipes has made a wholesome contribution for people seeking balance and good nutrition without sacrificing flavor or enjoyment."
3,Atmosphere is good,"This may contain a *SPOILER* for some. This movie creates a good ""scary feel"", filmed nicely, but whatever happened to suspense? If you want suspense, don't look for it here. This is no who-dunnit or not surprising. You know exactly who the killer is from the getgo. The focus is on why she kills. I did like how they gradually and progressively presented that. She sort of reminds me of Glenn close in ""Fatal Attraction"", twisted as a result of a really messed up childhood. Well that's expected. Adults lugging dolls and imitating children's storybook characters are indicative of something not quite right."
1,"Eh, could've done without . . .","Not so fabulous - the story line is good and was full of potential, but the acting is bad, and not in a humourouse way. . . and the few suggested deviant behaviors weren't strong or bothersome enough. I'll be donating this tarnished gem soon."
3,Always wash your hands...,"This movie provides us with a classic grim fairytale. Im not in love with the cast. The acting leaves a lot to be desired. The story is automatically told from the very beginning so if you're looking for a mystery look elsewhere. Overall it's an alright movie. Watch it, but don't buy it."
2,"No Midnight Magic here, Ms. Forster","I am a huge fan of Ms. Forster, and I have all of her books. There are some I am not happy with, but never like this. The story was cute, but the characters unbelievable with the excetion of Lena(I loved her), Austin(the drive and ambition of a brother who was going to make it), and maybe the mother(subtle and tactful control of her husband the way only a Sister can do it). There were story lines started and dropped, and extra characters hanging around doing dumb things. I was determined to finish the book just to see if it improved. It didn't. This is not one of Ms. Forster's better efforts."
2,Finally over,"Great concept but a very hard read. I'm not the best with grammar or spelling but this book was a very hard read with all the mistakes. Add to that the way the story jumped all around, that even me a person with ADHD couldn't keep up. I skimmed pages and skipped pages and just plan shook my head at pages. I now know why I didn't read this book when I first bought it many years ago and just stuffed it on the book shelf. I've read other books but Forster and they were a much better read then this."
3,ok,"When Patsy end's up pregant, and find out her boyfriend is cheating with her friend, she don't know what to do. Her father bribes her old boyfriend Austin into marrying her. Austin was forced to break up with Patsy when they used to date, so he still has feelings for her. Austin is worried that he want be able to give her the things she is use to but none of that matters to Patsy. Read how the two end up falling in love over again."
1,Midnight Magic,"This book was not one of Gwynne Forster best books, I was very disapointed. What happen Ms. Forster. The book just went on and on about the same old thing. Not a good read."
2,lg chocolate battery,this product is only good for a back up or emergency battery. it only last a good 5 to 6 hours a day depending on your usage.
2,OK TEMP BATTERY,IT FITS GOOD. CHARGES UP FINE BUT IT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG. IT SHUTS THE PHONE OFF RANDOMLY.
3,telling 7 for 11,"I purchased this talking watch, along with another -also talking- for an elderly of 85 and BLIND. The watches are quite beautiful, well designed and fit for its purpose of telling the time. Until, by accident, I discovered that it announces ""seven"" for the number 11, be it hours, minutes, am, pm. In disbelief, I discovered that the other (talking)watch I just bought is ALSO doing the same.I've notified the vendor and Amazon for further investigation: fabrication defect or design flaw.NOT, I'm pleased, NOT Made in USA."
3,fit the bill,I purchased the talking watch for a woman who has MS. She is living in a nursing home and this watch is one of the simple things that makes her life a little bit easier. She is very happy with the watch. It's easy to read and the volume of the woman's voice is loud enough that it can easily be heard.
2,"Works well, but not durable","Tel-Time IV Talking Watch-English-UnisexI have bought many (at least 5) of these watches for my Mother in Law. The watch is functional, easy to set with a dial, rather than a non-intuitive button sequence to set the time. The problem is with the durability of the rubber strap on the watch, which is where it always fails, right next to the lugs on the watch. This watch used to be $9.95, which made it less painful to replace frequently. The most recent one lasted about 2 months!I am going to try a different one, with a slip on metal band, and see how that works. She is hard of hearing as well, and this watch was loud enough.So, my overall opinion is....good AND bad!"
3,It talks,My mother is blind and this is the easiest thing out there. This is my third one. The previous models had batteries that were soldered in place. This one seems to have a replacable battery so that's a plus. The voice is oriental but understandable. A good value.
4,Real close to the Bikram Poses,"Great poses, I enjoy the Bikram work out but needed to do them at home. I just wish the guy would not announce every pose as we go through the work out."
5,Bikram-like home video,"Bikram heat intolerable! Barkan trained with Bikram, most of the postures are the same, variation on flow, shorter class time. Overall very good home video for those who like Bikram but not the heat (and not the cost of a class)."
5,Barkan Yoga DVD-esy to use at home,"I purchased this DVD after taking Bikram yoga classes for a month. I can't travel an hour to the yoga center every day (as is suggested with Bikram yoga), and though it was very helpful, I just couldn't travel. Bikram won't release a DVD because they want people attending the studios. That's all well and good, but some of us just can't do it.THIS IS NOT A BIKRAM KNOCK-OFF!I found the format easy to use, complete with tutorials, and the pace is easy to keep up with. I like that they use modifications and stress being gentle with our bodies if we have issues. The asanas are a workout but you can still do what you can, and gradually, you'll keep up.I love having this to work with at home!"
5,Hot yoga is great,This is a great DVD. One hour in length is the perfect time. Great interactive guidance is very helpful when making sure your form is correct.
4,Barkan Method,"I like it. I use it when I am on the road and can't get to my standard Bikram studio. Also, enjoy some of the different Hatha poses."
1,BORING,"I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS BUT HAD TO THIS ONE TIME. IF U WANT TO BE CHALLENGED WITH A GOOD, HARD WORK OUT, DON'T BUY THIS DVD!IT IS SO SLOW MOVING AND PAUSES BETWEEN POSES. I AM AT A BEGINNER LEVEL AND STILL DISLIKED THE ROUTINE. I DID THE WHOLE VIDEO AND NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT SORE THE NEXT DAY. WISH I COULD RETURN! IF ANYONE CAN RECOMEND A GREAT, CHALLENGING, FAST PACED VINYASSA STYLE DVD, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!!"
2,Too slow Yoga,I bought this DVD hoping it wouldbeagood workout similarto one I had participated in for about six months. This was far from it. This is more of an instructional teaching DVD. The moves arenot continuous because the instructor stops in between to go into a slow title of the move. I am sorry I purchased this DVD as it does not fit what I wanted.
2,frustrating,"I have been doing Bikram Yoga for a little while now and cannot always make it to the studio so I bought this as a fill in at home. I was bored to death and turned it off at Eagle Pose. Doing yoga in the hot studio where there is humidity and flow of poses makes it much easier to concentrate. I don't like Barkan's stop and announce, stop and announce then only doing the poses one time instead of twice.I think that in the right setting this could be a good DVD so I give it two stars-it is nice that they have tutorial. Not for me though!"
3,Broad slapstick,Good interplay between the two female leads who are supposedly feuding..intertwined are several subplots which are mildly amusing ..there are no belly busting laughs but I had a smile hovering on my lips....the characters are rather one dimensional but still amusing..very lightweight comedy with comedeic moments...agreeable time waster
4,Good Basic Biology Book,"Purchased this for Homeschool use and have found it to be a good, basic book for my 8th grader. I like the fact that there are ""mini quizzes"" at the end of each section, so the student can check him/herself on the knowledge they've learned. The chapters are laid out nicely, and the full color pictures are bright and interesting. If you buy this book for teaching purposes, I would recommend the accompanying Study Guide as well, unless you plan to be very hands on with the teaching. Also, be aware that this book does have a section on reproduction, though it's more about the biology of procreation than the act. I would definitely recommend this book to secular homeschoolers."
2,Not the best....,"I am always looking for sources of protein for my teenage vegetarian son so I thought I'd try these bars - also the price was right. My kids tried them and won't ever eat them again. The texture is exactly like styrofoam. I'd have to say that the flavor is ok, it is salty but I like that. I didn't like the texture either but it is low in calories, 70 for the bar. Since I'll be eating the whole box it's good that there is something good I can say about them."
2,inflexible,"This game is high on video effects but low on player flexibility..I found it difficult to set the game to my playing style and difficult to review a game once played beyond the chart given at the end of the game. This inflexibility, along with meager explanations of conventions used, makes it hard to learn from. Besides this, the cards for the dummy are small (in perspective across the table) and in a shadow, with spades and clubs frequently adjacent (as with hearts and diamonds) so that it is easy to misplay -- and there is no way to correct misplays. The tremendous need for computer power is also a problem. I am ordering Bridge Baron."
1,Misleading,"The description on the back of the box reads ""Omar Sharif Bridge II offers a game of intricate deliberation, skill and chance for the novice and expert"".I can't decide whether they were talking about the game or the interface to the game. With each click, I hoped that something may happen in the game, but the program just dumped me back out to Windows. The 3D-interface is non-intutive, and overkill for a simple card game.The box reads ""Master card champion Omar Sharif shows you how to improve your game and takes you through the bids."" For having a world bridge experts name on the box, one would think that the game would come with a tutorial on how to play the game or an interactive helper but the game fails to provide even this."
2,frances,"I used to have the Omar Sharif Bridge I, which was very straight forward. This one, Bridge II, is too glitzy. I don't like the layout of the hands and they have added too many bells and whistles which slows down the games."
1,sadistic,"Horrible...absent necessary features; misclick on pass and end up at grand slam level with no retraction. If mouse not exactly on cards, misplays easy with no retraction. Play competitively but opponents seem to always get dealt major or no-trump openers or many slams just when most convenient to win...idiotic bids by ""experienced"" partners at times. Seems to be written/coded by a sadist! Angle of view poor and as others have remarked for ""sophisticated"" graphics can't discern suits...unacceptable."
3,Skimpy coverage,"The DVD briefly highlights the 13-3 season of the 2003 Kansas City Chiefs - in just 35 minutes. The other 13 minutes of ""bonus"" material is nice bit about a sports-bar in South Philadelphia that is devoted to the Chiefs, and an unannounced visit there by Vermeil and other Chief coaches.Like the recent Chief defenses, this DVD has pretty weak coverage."
3,rock rock rock & roll it (mostly) is,"this is a must have movie for all 50's rock & rollers simply because it has the real stars of the era. it is always a great thrill to see real class acts e.g. chuck berry, lavern baker, moonglows, frankie lymon, johnny burnette etc in their prime and in full flight. thank god for the movie camera for now we have frankie lymon forever, and why wasn't lavern baker in more films? i would have been very happy as a teenager in 1956 if a new film was released every week. after all we didn't have music television then did we!! forget about the acting & story line in ""rock, rock, rock"" ... it's on a par with every other 50's r&r movie in that department, and that's why i've knocked off a couple of stars. buy the dvd because it's allan freed and 1950's rock & roll."
3,"Good Music,Bad Acting","The movie I first saw on AMC channel last summer and thought that the music was great but then I saw the acting and said ""Oh My God""!Where did they get these people.But awesome perfomances by Frankie Lymon & Others help the movie.This is a collecters item and if your a fan of Doo Woop & Rock'N'Roll you should get it."
4,If you are into 50's Rock and Roll music you got to see this,"For many years I listened to rock and roll oldies but this film features Chuck Berry, Frankie Lymon and the teenagers, music from Connie Francis. Actually the best thing about this film is all about the music and I dodnt care much for the storyline. However I cant wait to see the DVD version when it comes out this year. Currently I do have the old beta version of this video."
3,Rock Around The Clock,"Yes please, ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK.I was barely l8 way back in l955 when I saw this unforgettable movie above with Bill Haley and the original Platters.I urge Amazon.ca/com to do all its best to persuade the film producer to digitize this first rock 'n roll movie into DVD.There are millions of fans all over the world who would love to see this movie again in the privacy of their homes and relive the era of the Birth of Rock'N Roll. Please put this black-and-white film on DVD. Thanks"
4,An Average = 1 Star for Movie and 10 Stars for Music,"Rock! Rock! Rock!, on its own, isn't a good movie at all. Poor acting and poor plot.BUT (I repeat, BUT) it is filled with some of the best 1950s rock and roll that you will ever find put together (and on film no less!)- Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, Chuck Berry, Johnny Burnette Trio, The Moonglows, Lavern Baker, etc.When watching this movie, you will find that you will have to skip through the movie just to watch the rock and roll acts. But boy are they worth it!Get this film for the great performances and music. There's nothing like seeing some 1950s rock and rollers in their prime!"
5,Cheesy but great!,"If you love classic R&B and Rockabilly, this is the film for you. Although the dialog is cheesy, it showcases some of the best musical artists of that time. It will inspire you hit your nearest muusic store."
3,NEEDS BETTER TRANSFER!!!!!,Good rock film with many performers. The print is good but the poor transfer is just so distracting. Critics' Choice consistently puts out some of the worst transfers I've ever seen. With a little work someone could put out a decent copy of this film. Fullscreen.
1,By far not the best Gel Pen you can purchase,"Lots of Skipping, and not a smooth ""write"". Try Pilot's new G-Knock....I have CTS, so I need a very light weight, smooth-writing pen...its the best pen for my hand!"
2,Nice when it works,"Why am I writing a review on Saturday afternoon for a $1 pen? Because the 4-pack of Bic Velocity pens I have been struggling with has been so aggravating! As other reviewers have noted, the writing is smooth and comfortable. But after a few hours use, the thing starts skipping. Mess with it for a few strokes and it comes back, but then gives out again a short time later. So, I'm moving through my 4-pack, more quickly than I expected to, and when the last one starts acting up, I'm moving on to something else. I did get a nice lead on an alternative in one of the other reviews though. :-)"
2,"Black Ink Bad, Blue Ink Good","I've noticed that the Velocity black ink pens do not work as well as the Velocity blue ink ones. Whenever I started a new pen for the black ink, the ink would start skipping; however, with the blue ink, there wasn't any skipping and it lasted me 4 months. I love Velocity pens! They're smooth, comfortable, and neat (no smearing), but I would strongly suggest on getting the blue ink pens because of they don't skip."
1,They skip.,"These pens are, as far as i'm concerned, useless, as they skip. I want a pen for the purpose of writing; if they do not write, they aren't worth a dime. I'm very frustrated and disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"Good feel, Does not Write.","I have a box of 12 of these pens. They feel great in your hand and have a substantial build. Their only problem is that they do not write. Their ink stops flowing and makes writing difficult.These pens are a great option if you need an item that looks and feels good. If you are looking for a pen to write with, look elsewhere."
2,Not satisfied,"Everything seemed great with the textbook until class started and began lab. I noticed a few pages(important pages) from several chapters were missing. By then, it was too late to ask for a refund. The review mentioned nothing of missing pages being that the book was used. I assumed the seller is supposed to be trusted and let buyers know what they're getting. I'll be sure and check before deadline from now on. :("
1,Sloppy is a nice word for this performance,"I'm just completely overwhelmed by how much hype Tony Duggan as well as several other reviewers have given this performance. One reviewer stated that the other recording Klemperer performed with the Philharmonia was ""overrehearsed"". If that means that it's more ""together"" then I agree completely. What we have here is completely sloppy and in certain movements such as the 3rd, we have this un-bel-ievab-ly sloooooow drivel coming from our speakers. I have many recordings conducted by Klemperer that I absolutely love but this is a cruel joke. Other recordings that are ""performed"" in a unified way are Mehta with the Vienna Philharmonic, Bernstein with the New York Philharmonic from the 60's on Sony, and Bruno Walter's account combined with the 1st Symphony on Sony. I just cannot believe how overrated this recording really is. Don't buy it just to hear how bad it is. Just trust me on this one."
5,FORGET THE STUDIO VERSION!!,"Forget Klemperer's studio recording, it is terribly over rehearsed(except for the ending)...we have here a mysterious, unexpected and powerhouse of a interpretaion! They should have issued THIS recording instead of the other one on EMI's Great Recordings of the Century. This one has increased intensity and the sound is amazing still....I would say, one of the definive 2nd's alongside Kubelik's and Kaplan's."
4,Good CD,"A good cd with a few good songs. Bought it for the ""beat it"" remake mainly. Well worth the 8 bucks i paid for it"
4,Here's Where It All Starts,"The most complete collection of the most important work by the most dominant American musician of the first half of the 20th century.Too much hype?Trust me, this is a great collection, worthy of that hype. These are the recordings that cemented Armstrong's reputation as the most important instrumentalist of the age."
4,Virtual Pool 3 is the best Pool simulation I've ever played.,"This game comes complete with rules and ladders to climb your way to the top in ANY pool game you can imagine. It also has many games you've never even heard of. The unique thing about this game is that it guarantees to improve your (real life) pool game, which is absolutely true. Your angles will get better, your cue control will get better, and you will just have more fun. Beware, as this game will become addicting and you will lose track of time.The cons about this game? The original release of Virtual Pool 3 featured Jeannette Lee at the very top of the ladder, as well as occassional cinema scenes where she lets you know how much of a loser you are compared to her. This version does not have her at all."
2,Vista crash,"When I purchased this item from Amazon.com the information said that it is compatible with Windows Vista. It is not. It crashes on Vista. If Celeris has a fix for this, good luck on getting it from them."
5,"One of the most heartfelt, honest and open recordings ever","Leonardo's third album is a heartfelt expression of life. It inspires and reminds each of us to live, love and laugh and find our own adventures in our travels or in our own backyards. The writing and composition of the songs support each other equally in a beautiful, artistic embrace. Buy it. Really, you should. It's only 12 bucks and a bargain at twice the price."
4,Just ok,"I never been into liquid foundation because I prefer a matte finish than a gooey look, but it does give full flawless coverage. There are many shades, so you can pick the one that matches you straight on. I would most definitely recommend this to a friend."
4,Good Cover,"It is good cover, but I do not think it is made for the tropics as it makes me sweat that is why I am giving it a four star.I am from Nigeria.It arrived earlier than I expected.Thanks."
2,Strange...,"I am a complete beginner, I figured this was a good set to start with. Only observation is that the clubs are individually labelled ""Ladies"". I compared them to ""Mens'"" sets, and they appear to be the same size. Mostly just another embarassment really, on top of my poor game!"
2,Looks cheesy,"Very comfortable to wear, but it looks cheesy. It's ok as a little fun watch. The face of it is fine, but the band compromises the look."
1,STINKY & ATROCIOUS!,"I have had a constitutional aversion for the ""Name Game"" since I was three. This idiotic piece has nothing in creation to recommend it and it is darned irritating to boot. It is pure torture. I would much rather hear jackhammers and construction equipment.Get Pete Seeger's Folk Collections for kids instead. This cd has a lot of stinky junk that is not only hearing unfriendly, but is an insult to your intelligence and your ears."
3,Needed some modification,"I had to fiddle with solder and buy a few connectors to make this work properly on my Silverado. However it has been wired to my battery and I keep it wrapped around my master cylinder until I hook up my winch on a front mount reciever. Works fine for what I need. Not a totally universal kit, however, and a bit expensive for the work required."
3,tribute song...?,"this song is pretty similar to Fun Factory's ""I Wanna B with U"".But anyways I enjoyed it."
4,Excellent book,"This is a very practical book, easy to understand and apply, and the dvd contains very helpful forms to use in your classroom. It highlights very important topics of classroom management."
5,Discipline in the Secondary Classroom,This book provides practical troubleshooting techniques that help teachers solve 42 common behavior problems. I would recommend it as an excellent resource for gaining control in the classroom.
3,"Mostly ""textbook"" examples...","I was looking for a ""novel"" approach to discipline, but this book reminds me of a boring textbook I had to read when I was in college. The book is the book for you if you are looking for that ""textbook"" kind of book, but if you have already read all the textbooks you wanted to read about discipline, then this book is not for you. I have found many other books about discipline more helpful than this one."
4,For the traditional classroom,"This is a great resource for grades 7-12 teachers. It provides traditional solutions for 42 common behavioral problems. The provided solutions can be useful background information when discussing student problems with other teachers at the school.I appreciated the discussion of violent threats and extortion, but was not edified by a discussion of messy homework.I will keep this book in my classroom as I gain experience with understanding the games adolescents play."
5,really happy with this purchase,"""almost summer"" is a beach boys song in all but name. classic tune. i also rediscovered ""magic"" by pilot. cool lost classic. also ""melody for an unknown girl"" is cool. a lot of pleasant surprises. would recommend one hundred percent to true music lovers."
4,Slightly disappointed,"I purchased this CD for 2 songs - Quick Joey Small - because it took me back to my Jr. High days where I went to school with a Joey Small, and Washington Square, which to my disappointment was not an original recording, but one that sounded as if it was being played at 78rpm in the days of LPs and record players. I didn't know most of the other songs on this CD. So my search continues for an original recording of Washington Square."
4,Good synopsis of 100+ fastpitch drills--recommended!!,"This book contains over a hundred softball drills with a picture for each drill on the facing page to the text describing the drill.For youth fastpitch softball coaches, this book offers a wealth of offensive and defensive drills."
4,Very Good Read,"'FA', was an entertaining look at people accepting their past and making a productive life for themselves. Carrie's growth was a joy to watch, her past pain did not make her stop thinking that their was still happiness to be had, if you take another chance on love. Family bonding was great in this. A book you'll enjoy reading."
3,"Rent it .. watch it, return it .. and move on",Got this for the kids (although I am a bigger fan of most of their movies then they are.) The movie is a bit slow moving for the younger viewers with long unnecessary dialogue. The story line is a bit weak for the older viewers. The scenery fails to capture the imagination and overall it was one of those movies you sort of say .. yea it was worth watching .. once.
1,Wow. Is this really the fantastic actor from Slingblade??,"I found that I could not like Billy Bob in this movie. I don't know what it was... he just didn't have energy, or much expression... his portrayal made it so that I wasn't excited for his accomplishments. I was disappointed, but I wasn't really expecting much so... yeah."
3,Let someone check your work.,"AT least that is what should of occured when this script was written. Farmer blasts off in his rocket, across his ranch, through bill boards and crashes. He is in the hospital for how long? He rebuilds his rocket after how long? He launches after how long. I suppose if you went by what you saw the guy healed from multiple fractures, salvaged all the parts from his crashed ship, raised the money all in about 2 weeks. At least that would explain why his kids didn't age a day. C'mon, someone is supposed to check these scripts for flaws,,,right???."
3,"Nice family film, but...","I really enjoyed the film, but had to question the reality of how loyal the wife and kids would be to Farmer's passion. I think we all wish our families had this kind of comraderie, but it was a bit over the top."
3,Good family fare,"Dreams can unite a family so strongly that no bank, Federal agency, or member of the press can tear them apart. ""Astronaut Farmer"" is not just a story about impossible dreams, but all the subtle nuances that keep people hanging on and hanging together.Okay, you not only had to suspend disbelief, you had to lock it up and leave it alone til the film is over--still, it's well acted, beautifully filmed and produced. And yeah, it's one of those films that you leave feeling better. That's worth the time and it's definitely worth showing your kids.Except well--don't try this at home folks!"
2,Suspend all belief in the space program,"I guess because I was a teenager during the '60s, and I followed the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs, I had a tough time enjoying any of this movie. How anyone today could get a Mercury era space suit, much less wear it without the air conditioning unit, while riding a horse on a Texas ranch, really makes for great fantasy. When Billy Bob Thornton's character tries to launch the first rocket himself and it fails, igniting the rocket sideways on the ground (and he survives?!!!) is farfetched, to be kind. The only really interesting part is the conflict between Thornton and Virginia Madsen after that.I've loaned the DVD I (sadly) bought to three people; only one had any positive comments. If you think you might want to buy this DVD, rent it first. Or you can have mine..cheaply."
2,HOKUM Alert!,"Being a fan of the Polish bros earlier works, I had high hopes for their first non-indie film. What a disappointment. Spoiler alert - if they would have stopped at the first launch ie; crash and near disaster, maybe this fable could have gone somewhere. But to literally ""pull our legs off"" with the ridiculous second launch (ending with Farmer Astronaut on Jay Leno) pooooieeee! Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but utter hokum (even Frank Capra would roll over in his grave with this one). Take a break guys, and go back to indies! I need to clear the syrup and honey off my screen! Yuk!"
2,"Started interesting, got bad fast (**SPOILERS**)","It looked like a promising premise, with good actors, but just became so implausibly silly. He launches early and almost kills himself, then somehow quickly rebuilds his rocket/spacecraft after it took years to build the first one? That just didn't seem very believable, even for a movie that requires a lot of suspension of disbelief."
1,Yawn,"Plodding, boring, and pointless. Can't really complain about how believable (or not) it is, since stories like these are more like morality tales. But the main character shows weak character in abandoning his family to pursue his dream, so it's hard to really empathize with him."
3,Entertaining,"I first saw this movie in a plane during 2007 and wanted to add it to my collection since, although the story is unbelievable, I think is funny and nice to watch with the kids. Couldn't find it in stores. I think is a better alternative than many others around that did better in the box office."
3,alright,"I thought it would be a better movie. My son liked it, but is wasn't thrilled with it. It was an alright movie and even I found myself rooting for The Astronaut Farmer at times."
1,Just plain silly,The Astronaut Farmer has such a preposterously idiotic script that no amount of good acting (which is there) can save this film. It is such a waste of time I'm almost embarrassed to write this review.
2,GREAT?,I really liked it for the simple reason it made me laugh a lot. I would like to know if this is the end of decent and watchable movies from the US.
1,please,"Back in 1979 there was a short lived TV show called Salvage 1, Andy Griffith played a Junkman who builds a rocket out of spare parts in his junkyard, I enjoyed that show mainly because I was 10 at the time, I'm not ten anymore."
3,"GOOD UPLIFTING FILM BUT, NOT TOTALLY ABSORBING!",I watched this movie this weekend and I expected it to be a little better than it turned out. It's a good movie with fine performances all around. It just didn't pull me in like I wanted it to and it seemed a bit long even though it's only a little over a hour and a half. It's certainly worth watching and it does have an uplifting ending so you may want to rent instead of buying it.
2,Disappointing,"I guess I should have gone with my initial instinct to pass on this one, but a 99c rental made it too easy to download. The idea of overcoming adversity, opposition and skepticism to achieve your dreams is a fine theme for a movie, but this one pushes so far past the bounds of plausibility and uses such tired caricatures that it just became annoying."
5,THE ASTRONAUT FARMER,THIS IS A REALLY GREAT MOVIE ABOUT A MANS STRUGGLE TO REACH HIS DREAMS WHEN ALL APOSE HIM EXCEPT HIS FAMILY. AS HIS PLANS TO REACH FOR THE STARS DRAW EVER CLOSER. A PHYSICALY GRIPING AND EMOTIONALLY BINDING EVENT AS YOU ARE CAUGHT UP IN HIS STRUGGLE TO BECOME ALL HE CAN BE. A MUST WATCH MOVIE AND A GEM FOR ANY COLLECTION. BILLY BOB THORNTON HAS GIVEN ANOTHER STELLAR PERFORMANCE AS ONLY HE CAN DO.
4,papa40,"Evidently, some of John holmes first pictures. 2 of them were excellent.I liked the way the women looked in that time. Plenty of pubic hair.Decent stories-typical John Holmes.Plenty of expliciet sex"
2,goodie and a oldie for sure,"this was probably a good movie for the time but, it being taped to DVD from VHS lost a lot detail. I should of figured, i could not even sit through the entire lenght of the movie it made me dizzy."
2,not so much!,"I am a lady and got this DVD for one reason... reported large size. Now, what is all the fuss? I don't get it. Glad the price was not more but even so I feel I over paid ..... there is/was the hype.I say, ""save your time and money"". ""Buy one of the 'instuctional' videos sold by Amazon and get more."" Oddly enough the DVD shows decor and fashion as awful as 1960-70's porn! This DVD should get XXX for that alone and I would watch!Those poor guys! Not only the women were objectified!"
4,Good but first ingredient Olive Oil,"It's definitely been a good protective product for my family - 3 pale, pale Irish folks. Non of us have burned and in the past we would use 50 and still burn. So, it's definitely working in our opinion. It smells a little like lavendar and olive oil. And it's a little lumpy. And it makes the water pill up on your skin - showing it's VERY water proof.I'd buy it again. It's natural and it works. I'm not a natural freak. But if a natural solution without harmful chemicals works better than the other stuff, then I'll switch. This is one of those products."
5,"Safe chemistry, easy to apply, prevented sunburn on child","Happy with this product. It got high ratings for safe ingredients from the Environmental Working Group, applies very smoothly (unlike some other zinc oxide-based lotions that clump up into chalky wads), and protected my fair-skinned little guy from sunburn at his summer baseball game."
1,very missleading,The picture and description (and price) would have you think you are receiving multiple items but it is ONLY 1 tube of spf 30! It is $13 dollars elsewhere on amazon.
1,Completely Let Down,"We were looking to buy an organic sunscreen, as our family has used some in years past and has loved it. The health food store we were shopping in, however, didn't carry any. But the salesperson led us to a display of Badger sunscreen, saying how great it worked how good its ingredients were. We bought it.Only we've been sorely disappointed. Sorely. We don't get much sun in Seattle, but this past weekend was sunny and hot (for here). We lathered up ourselves and our kids in our Badger spf 15, and in the length of a single soccer game, each of us was crispified.I guess I'm just tired of sunburns. I've had too many. But taking ""precautions"" by using Badger's sunscreen was clearly a mistake for our family.Maybe the higher spfs work--I don't know. I do know, though, that we won't risk buying Badger again."
2,Didnt work for us,"We have a convertible and live in Hawaii. Last week, three of us drove around the island and were directly exposed to the sun for about 3 hours. The two guys applied this sun screen soon into the trip and I wore no sunscreen. At about 4 PM the two guys faces were VERY bright red so much that a friend commented on how red their faces were. Mine was not. Of course part of this has to do with skin type- their faces are more prone to getting red with the sun than mine (although Im pretty fair) - so I cannot be certain. However, that experience gave me little confidence in this product and I will not use it again. I CAN say that we were very impressed that all of the ingredients in this product are natural. If it ""worked"" for us it would be great."
2,Good but really not,"Sure it's top rated by cosmetic database, but it's pasty and so white it's gross!"
4,Good compact reference,"Combat Leader's Field Guide is a great compact reference on platoon and squad level operations. It basicly summarizes information contained in US Army field manuals FM 7-8 and FM 21-75. This book achieves it's stated goal of being a pocket reference that you can take to the field with you to jog your memory. It fits in a BDU pocket, though the top end does stick out. National Guard and Reserve personel will probably find it useful though most active duty combat arms personel should know this stuff by heart already."
4,Worthy of being a Personal Library Addition,"I bought this book while in in a Military Training environment (Officer Training School to be specific). The Text was awesome and covered a gamut of situations, one's I was likely never to come across in my ""personal choice"" of a career field. Regardless, it was a great text, and gave some food-for-thought on situations - bivouac, making sure your troops have the correct gear for the situation at hand, etc.Worthy addition to any military member's personal library. Though the text, rightfully so, is Army-centric there are tidbits of knowledge to be gained throughout."
5,Go Army,Useful information on infantry tactics. Good for learning as much as one can from a book. If you want to learn military infantry tactics than this is a good start for sure. I have learned more from reading the book. Helps me even though I am not infantry in the Army.
5,Great book,"If you conduct training sessions, this series of books is awesome. Lots of ideas that can be implemented in numerous ways. Buy the whole series."
2,"First things first - terminal performance objectives, audience analysis","....This book can be very helpful if you've done your homework about the performance needs and the audience first.IF YOU<li>Identify what specific on the job performance needs exist for the audience; and whether and how to address those needs through a training session, and</li><li>Identify the characteristics of the audience so you know what appeals to them in a training session,</li>THENSelect games from this book if they are appropriate to the terminal (on the job) performance objectives and audience analysis.This book won't do that for you.Nor tell you how.Nor even tell you whether.pvitkus@wizdom.com"
2,"Essential reading for law students, but a real snoozefest","If you are required to read this in law school, don't waste your money on a new copy. I got an old copy dirt cheap and I am glad I did. The book is difficult to get through. The beginning is very interesting, but then it gets very dry. I never finished it."
4,"Took awhile, but no longer than they projected","Product arrived a few days later than I expected it to, but still within the promised time-frame. It was in the promised condition."
5,No Wonder It's A Classic!,"It's no surprise that Gideon's Trumpet, first published in 1964, it still being read. It's truly a classic! Five stars for story, perspective, background, style, and literary, historical, and legal interest. Read it. It's important. And it's a good book. As timely today as thirty five years ago."
1,Disappointing,"After having heard the wonderful tenor voice of Ian Bostridge, singing Schubert and Bach, how disappointed I have been, upon hearing my favorite tenor laboriously singing in French. I believe that the instruments do not help, either, as they seem to overpower Bostridge.I believe that Bostridge shines with only a piano accompaniment; and he positively soars when singing in German. The range of his voice is wide and the timbre wondrous. He is made for Schubert and Bach. After having heard this French offering, I may not order his English CD. I don't want to spoil my enchantment with this tenor voice singing in German."
3,Disappointing,"Sorry people, but I found this one disappointing, the continual mix seems to go on a bit, not like Bukem's other stuff at all.It does indeed sound like the live set he played last year, but somehow there just isn't enough variety. The second CD being purely instrumental is a bit of a rip off really."
5,Awesome hockey video!,"This is a reality type tv show which ran in Canada (on CBC) and focused on hockey players who wanted to get a chance (or a second chance) to make it to the NHL. Great character stories and competitive spirit in the series.If you like hockey, reality shows and are interested in what it takes to ""make the cut"" this is a great buy."
4,Bottoms Up,Most people think of rum as mixer with coke or in fruity tropical drinks like daiquiris. Edward Hamilton's The Complete Guide To Rum will open your eyes to the wonderful world of rum. Mr. Hamilton examines various types of rum and the countries of their origin. Anyone who has a passion from rum or is interested in fine alcohol should check out this guide.
1,Horrible quality item,This item arrived with part of the LCD burned out - and the charge indicator light burned out. The NOAA feature is supposed to scan several NOAA channels looking for your local channel. It scanned and stuck on the second channel that was just static. The only thing that worked was the flashlight part. Just very shoddy merchandise for the price.
3,Seems noisy,"Easy to install, but when the ice maker or water dispenser is operating it seems a bit noisier than before, when I had the factory original filter installed."
4,Can't get the knockoffs anymore,"These GE filters work fine. Now that one can't purchase the cheaper knockoffs anymore, one doesn't have a choice in any case. Buy them from Amazon and save money vs. purchasing directly from GE."
3,Works,Does exactly what it is supose to do.Just wish it was not so expensive. Alsowish it lasted longer.
2,Filter did not fit refrigerator,"description was not specific, had to discard item and my own loss due to the fact it was not compatible with my refrigerator."
5,AS Expected,"i run mine until they are plugged off. it went in perfect, ran 3 gallons thru it and we are off to the races."
5,Does what it is meant to do,"We have tried other products in our GE refrigerator but something always went wrong..hard to install or to remove and sometimes leaks. With this unit, that does not happen. Installation is easy and the water tastes fine and keeps on tasting filtered for at least 6 months for our family. It does cost more but over 6 months+ we think it is worth it. The 3-pack also gives you some savings and should last for about 2 years."
5,Excellent Follow Up Service,The filter I received was damaged. The The supplier promptly sent a no charge replacement even though I told the supplier that I was able to use the origional filter.
5,Perfect!,"This is exactly what I needed, it came right to my doorstep, I installed it easily, and now we have fresh filtered water again. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Awesome,"Exactly what we needed, came faster then was told and worked awesome!Fit where it was supposed to, cheaper then the ""store"", now I have extra as well.Thank You"
4,Filter worked fine,The filter work fine. It was cheaper than any where else.It is not available at all local hardware stores
2,Caused my water dispenser to malfunction,"After installing this water filter, the water dispenser system in the door of my fridge stopped working and the water started coming out as a trickle. After a contractor determined there was nothing wrong with the plumbing or refrigerator, it was determined that this filter was causing the problem."
5,GE GSWF Refrigerator Water Filter,"My fridge's built in water dispenser had slowed to a trickle, and after replacing the water filter, now works perfectly. Install was a breeze."
2,Great Deal,This is the same unit that GE Parts listed for twice the price from Amazon. Works great! Plug & filter.
4,Arrived Promptly Fit Perfectly Filters Fine,"I received this item in good time and at a good price - better than what Sears was charging for it. It fit my fridge just as good as the old one. Seems to filter the water just fine. I didn't give it 5 stars because, it's just a filter - it just sits there! Maybe if it lasts a long time I will come back and give it 5 stars."
1,It didn't fit,"I bought this product, two of them, thinking they would have to fit my 2009 GE Profile. Wrong. It screwed in but would not engage the water pump release. I sent them back. My replacement part number is different from the one on this product. Still looking for a replacement. P006. This one did not work for me."
3,Does not work for Profile Side by Side,The description says this item is for GE refrigerators. If you have a GE Profile side-by-side you must buy the MSWF and not the GSWF.
1,"got filter in timely manner,","got filter in a timely manner, was however sent a wrong filter, thought I had made an error, merchant was prompt with response, but even when I received correct filter, it did not register with my refrigerator? I don't know what problem is?? but because I can't get a green light on the refrigerator, then evidently something is wrong??????"
4,"Nice filters, but way too expensive","It's great to have filtered water in your fridge, but these suckers are too expensive. I searched all over the web but no one was selling these for a decent price. There are some 3rd-party brand filters, but even they aren't cheap. I finally picked the place that had free shipping but I had to order a bunch at once. Seems like a rip off, but my ice maker won't work without a filter. GE recommends replacing the filters every 6 months but I'm going to try for 12 months this time (and just press the filter reset button on my fridge half-way though). We don't use it much anyway except for making ice."
4,Fridge filter,"Thought we had one of these in our fridge from the start, but no. Installs easily and cleans the taste subtly."
2,Maybe a returned item?,"Received the product in a timely manner but they seemed to have been previously owned or misordered and returned. The bar code portions of the boxes had been cut off, which made me think that someone else had claimed a rebate or refund on them. The silver foil on the caps appeared to have been untampered with, so I assume they are still safe to use. Had I been able to identify to find the shipper on the internet, I definitely would have called to complain."
1,wrong product,wish there was a list of ref types it can fit. bought the wrong one.our unit is a GE too and also uses GSWF but i guess there are a lot of these types but different spout inside.why would GE make so many different kinds when they all look the same and have the same shape and height.i guess it is so people keep buying and buying!!!now what am i going to do with this one?! since i already opened the seal
1,They were used!,"Safety seals were missing; the one filter was missing the safety seal entirely. For this one, scotch tape was placed over it. The second filter had a safety seal that was punctured, along with a dirty substance on both filters. I contacted the seller, but I never received a reply- which leads me to the conclusion that they were used. I do not feel comfortable purchasing from this seller ever again."
4,Dual-action filter,"It filters your water, and is equally, if not more, efficient at filtering money from your wallet. Seriously, I know all about the razor/razor-blade revenue model, but they got nothing on the refrigerator/water filter racket. And last I looked, razors didn't cost $2500.So yeah, it filters your water good, and doesn't make a lot of noise or come in the wrong color or is not compatible with the latest HDMI 1.4 standards. It's a water filter. And it's more than $30 for some charcoal and plastic. I just have to note how unwelcome this fact is."
1,unsatisfied customer,i beleive this product was used. after 2 weeks telling me to replace the unit again. this is not right!!!!!
1,It didn't fit,I bought this filter because it said it fit GE refrigerators. It didn't fit my side by side but I opened it and can't return it.
2,Disappointing,"To my surprise, I found that this book is outdated in many respects, especially in the area of psychopharmacology -- SSRIs are not even mentioned amongst the antidepressants.In addition, several key passages are confusingly worded, as are some of the questions on the practice tests. Sometimes the answers provided for the practice tests are clearly wrong or could have been correctly answered by more than one selection. Answer keys for chapter review questions have not always been updated to match updated questions.I finished reading the book to get as much information as I could, but I will be sure to read at least one recent psychology textbook so that I can correct any errors in my learning."
3,"Only OK For Me, Dog...","Nice cutting board. Great size, and I like the groove around the outside to catch juices. However, this thing slides around on my granite countertops. The rubber corners are too small and don't keep the rest of the board elevated, so the corners plus the board touch the counter, which causes it to slide.If a cutting board that doesn't slide is your most important feature, I would avoid this one. Otherwise it's OK."
1,Nor Pro Grip-Ez 12x16 Cutting Board,This board warped within 3 days of purchase. Cutting meat or veggies left deep marks on board. I would not buy this type of board again.
4,Very Nice,"It works, it is sturdy. I would have been nice if the side of the board that has the grove in it had some sort of mark. Twice I put the board on the counter, slapped the meat on it to cut, an realized that I had it up-side down."
5,non-slip cutting board,We like the non-slip feature of this cutting board. It is a good side. The gutters have worked well. Sharp knives will make a dent in the plastic.
2,Tastes burnt!,"This cheese is baked until crunchy and is a low carb, low calorie snack. It tastes burnt and is extremely crunchy, like tooth breaking crunchy. I will not buy it again."
2,"Eh, a little too weird for me","I really do like the little bags of snacks from this company, but the bars are too weird. They are basically the same, but shaped like a bar. But it's not the same as popping a disc into your mouth and snacking on it like a chip or something. I'm not really sure what this one was trying to emulate. Maybe a granola bar?I dunno, the taste was similar to me, but it was... weird.They are also (like the snack bite things) very salty).I'd stick to things like theJust the Cheese Mini Round Snacks, Classic White Cheddar, 0.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 16)if you want a crunch - or look for their lower salt versions if you are watching sodium."
2,Salty & too much sat fat,"Didn't like it, BUT, if the manufacturer is listening, it could be saved. Go with low fat/low sodium cheese, make the bar slightly bigger and you might even market it as a health food to the vegetarian market. As is, the best use would be to dump it in a soup for taste."
1,Inedible.. even Mikey didn't like them!,"Before you read this, I highly recommend Just the Cheese's mini rounds in the same flavor. I DO NOT recommend these bars. If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.I thought these would be great.. I love Jalapeno, and I love cheese.. what could go wrong? These bars could and did! They are extremely hard to bite into. I worried about cracking my teeth on them. They taste like jalapeno flavored salt blocks.I gave them to a friend of mine who eats anything and everything (Mikey Jr!). He didn't like these either. He's going to try breaking them up (I assume with a hammer) and put them in his next batch of chili. I wish him good luck. I suggested that he use them for repelling pests in his garden.I wrote the company, and they sent me some samples of the mini rounds. I was skeptical, but they are GREAT! I'll order those next time.. they are not too salty, just the right amount of crunch, and taste great. They have 5 or 6 flavors and I like them all."
1,Total garbage; poor excuse for a snack!,"These are definitely the worst snack I have ever purchased in my life. Dry as the Sahara Desert, not much taste, and way overpriced. Save your hard-earned money for something else."
1,A Bad Idea!,"These seemed to be a great low-carb easy-to-carry snack items. NOT! They were easy to carry but everything else was a bust. Dry as dust and unpleasant in the mouth, far too salty to be pleasant, just all around a bad idea."
4,Yummy!,"I have been doing a low carb diet for a year now, and I love these. They are a great snack between meals and I really like the taste of them. The pizza is my fav. so far."
1,Disgusting!,"Salty, too hard to bite, and tastes like chewing on a salt lick. With so much sodium, this is totally a terrible choice. Do not buy!"
1,GROSS,"I didnt like the after taste at all, way to salty. Now Im stuck with a huge box! Im hoping to be inspired to get creative and find a use for them."
4,Delicious snack,"These are easily one of my favorite low-carb and low-calorie snacks when I'm doing the whole ""no carb"" deal. They are dry -- but I like them that way. They are filling and they taste good. They're not for everyone so before you buy one box of each flavor, try the bars (they're pretty dry) or the chips (less dry) and see how you like them."
3,A Noisy Clock,"We're very glad we didn't purchase this clock for a bedroom. It has a loud tick that can be heard from the next room.Also, just FYI, the face is an odd off-white color... It has a bluish-gray tinge to it. The best things about this clock are the price and wood trim."
1,Arrived broken in half,Arrived broken in half-Always a hassle to package things back up and get them to the Post Office. Very disappointed.
4,Nice but different than expected,"I received the clock in a reasonable amount of time. The quality seems to be good so far. Have had it a couple of months. The color is a much lighter wood than what is depicted online, but other than that it met all expectations."
4,Should have looked for a silent clock but this is still great,"I love the look of this clock. Unfortunately, the ticking is annoying since my home is usually pretty quiet (rarely have the tv or anything on). I put it in my tack room so I can keep track of time when I'm out with my horses. It works great, looks great. I got a silent clock to replace this one in my living room."
5,Looks great,Has real wood bezel. The color is lighter than picture. Looks good none the less. Could not find a similar clock at the price in store.
3,office clock,"I purchased this clock for my office at work and it is just OK. The wood frame is quite a bit lighter in person, which I am disappointed with. It also doesn't feel particularly solid, but of course this doesn't matter once its hanging. The ticking is much louder than what I feel is average, so I am hoping I get used to that, and of course I am also hoping it doesn't bother my neighbor. For the price, however, it seems to do the job."
1,Stark's guide book of Trinidad and history Including Tobago and Grenada,Very bad copymost of the integrity and photo quality lost in transition. Copy needs to be redone professionally as this is a rare documentJameel
4,The best I've used so far,I have received nothing but compliments from using this product. People automatically assume I have a texturizer or something other than a leave-in conditioner in my hair. I recommend this product to others. I'm sure there are other great products out there but I'm getting tired of experimenting and wasting money. So for now I'm going to stick with this leave-in - if it's not broke don't fix it :)
1,Did Not Work,"After reading all the glowing reviews on this product, I thought my prayers had been answered. I was incredibly disappointed that the product absolutely did not work for my daughter. We still have yet to find a product that will put an end to the nightmare of fixing her hair!"
1,Did absolutely nothing for my hair,This product did absolutely nothing for my hair @my hair is very curly. Did not define my curls at all..still look frizzy..waste of money on this product.
4,Great conditioner,"Great product for those who have a natural wave to their hair. Not necessarily made for permed hair, like mine."
4,Ok,"It does tame my hair and make is shiny, but if you put to much in it weighs it down. So a small amount is all you need. Helps with the frizzys!!Judy Reppart"
3,Hmmm,"The thing about this leave-in conditioner is that you need a lot of product in order to achieve a decent look. Don't get me wrong, it does work... But you only get so much in that tiny little bottle. It's kind of weird how the owners decided to make the bottle so small when the majority of people with curly hair have very thick, unruly hair. Why such a small body? Anyway, back to the point... it dries crunchy and sometimes leaves my hair hard."
2,Leave in conditioner is ok,This conditioner is ok. If you use a whole lot if makes your curls look real nice. But you have the more you have in your hair the heavier it makes your hair. Both me and my daughter have long thick hair and with all that product it makes my neck hurt. I didn't like how it also made your hair hard and that you could not touch it too much after it dryed or else it would give you flakes.
5,Mixed Chicks is excellent for curly hair!!,"I found Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner after an exhaustive search for a product that softly defined my curls, kept frizz to a minimum, and didn't have the stiffness left by products containing alcohol. For curly hair, do NOT comb or brush your hair. After shampooing, use a conditioner that you wash out. Then, wring hair dry. Scrunch out excess moisture with a towel. Put some Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner in your hands and scrunch it through your hair. Then, take more product and ""rake"" it through the hair close to your scalp. You can use a bit more to outline the curls around your face and just at the ends. It's a bit of trial & error to determine how much you need, but this product is the ONLY one I use anymore. If you aren't using Mixed Chicks shampoo & regular conditioner before you use their leave-in conditioner, be sure to use products without sulfates."
2,not loving Mixed Chicks leave in!,"I tried the leave in conditioner 2 times on my biracial little girl's hair and was not too impressed. this product is good if you wash and detangle daily. but after 1 day, hair is dry and tangled. my daughter's hair is mostly straight with a slight wave and curly ends. gel from $ store and water works better for us then this stuff. won't waste my money on it again. this company ignore moisture needs completely"
3,Only fair so far,"A little thick and ""gloppy' does not seem to reduce tangles more than other products and creates significant build up quickly. Will use a while longer and hope for better results"
3,I'm not sure yet,"I think I will like this product for my daughter, as she gets older mostly. She is 13 months old now and mixed with black and white. She has short hair still and I put the leave in conditioner in her hair after her bath in the evening. So she does sleep on it which is why maybe I am not as thrilled with the product (i.e. bed head in the am). I am thinking as her hair gets longer I may see more ""results"" with seperating curls, etc"
3,it's good but,"The reason I gave it only three stars , is because it contains not only one but 4 paraben list.... I don't like that because when I use leave in conditioner , I would let it stay for 3 -4 days . My hair is 3b-3c"
5,Really Good Product,"I love this product, I have recently ordered a second bottle. I have curly / wild-ish hair, so this product actually calms my frizzes and makes my hair more manageable and soft. I think this is gonna be one of my must have products."
1,Save your cash,"Not at all worth the hype. Save your hard earned money because there are products on the market that are much better for way cheaper. I used it for about 2 weeks and gave it away. Try Pro-L$ne comb-thru $oftener, it's cheaper and does a much better job."
2,Not impressed,"I am a white guy with curly dry hair. This product looked good for about an hr, but the style didn't last for long. And forget about running your hands through your hair with this stuff in it. I have searched for a long time to find a product that works in my hair. Granted I only tried this product once. But I could tell it wasn't for me. I am currently using Wen's leave in conditioner, and it seems to be the best around now that Crew discontinued their leave in condition for men."
2,Biracial Hair Mess,"Well i bought it over christmas (i'm of italian, spainish & black decent btw) it makes my hair shiny & soft but doesn't control my frizz. (which is suppose to) I followed the direction on the bottle & the online videos but it still came out even worse then before. My hair looks even more terrible. My hair is natually thick but has a wavy,curly texture i wanted something that kept my wavy curls but helped frizz. I'm so disappointed. I've heard so much good things about the product it really ticks me off that it worked better on my grandmothers hair she has no frizz her hair is like a white person's but it's curly. It made me wonder if i used it right i did like it said in the video the girl in the video had the kind of texture of hair i did but it didn't work on me. :("
5,Great Stuff,"I have been looking for a good leave in conditioner for a very long time, and feel like I finally found one. I am mixed (Black/White) and have fairly dry hair. In the past I have used leave in conditioners and then had to use a gel or mousse to keep my curls tamed. I was able to use this leave in with no other product, and it left my hair soft, tamed, and with a nice shine. Also I comb my hair in the shower, and with many products after being in my hair for a day I have had great difficulty getting the comb through my hair the next morning (yes even with the water streaming down!) Mixed Chicks creates no tangles, and the comb easily goes through. It is heavy so if you're used to light weight leave in's be forwarned. Definitely a great product for curly mixed girl hair."
1,Not what I expected...,Not quite sure what the big hype is for this product. I tried it and it just made my hair crunchy and dry. I actually didn't buy it on Amazon (purchased @ beauty supply) so thankfully I was able to return it. Don't waste your money.
3,"This is NOT PARABEN free, that is not natural!","I've been using this conditioner on my 4 year old african american biracial daughter for two years and I've recently realized that is it NOT an all natural product. I am so bummed and disillusioned. I thought I was doing right to leave this conditioner in her hair day in and day out, only to find I've been subjecting her to hair poisoning! I do like how this product works, though it does leave a build up after a few days, but I cannot in good conscious continue using this product. I am now on the search for a sulfate and paraben free conditioning alternative. So far, Deva Curl ""No Poo"" shampoo has been working well, but now I need to find the right conditioner."
4,Great Stuff!,"Will be brief. Best stuff I've put in this mop of mine in years. Great service. Will buy again and will try other products. I recommend, highly."
5,This stuff is awesome!!,I am of Jewish heritage and have extremely curly. This product is great and makes my hair look and feel soft. It brings down the frizz and I just bought some for my mom.
5,Works wonders!,I have long curly hair that tends to form ringlets. I bought this product on recommendation from a friend and it really does work great. It lets my hair curl naturally without feeling stiff or greasy. I've been using this product for a few months now and I really love it!
2,Just Had to Say Something,"I have never written an amazon review before but I just had to say something. I was shocked to see such high reviews for this product. It must really depend on your hair type because it did nothing for my 3c/4a natural hair. It made it sticky and crunchy and did not moisturize it. That was the most important part though-- no moisture! I was sort of impressed by the product when I first got it because I was newly natural and didn't really realize what moisturized hair feels like. It does not feel like this. Maybe if you have naturally oily hair that needs daily washing, this product will work for you. If your hair is naturally dry like mine and requires a lot of moisture, steer clear."
4,good,good moisturizer and repair product for hair. provides frizz control. over-defines my curls so found it works better when I use it as an occasional treatment.
2,ok?,"I bought this for me and my daughter, both of us have curly hair. I like it in her hair, but it made mine feel a little greasy and weighed down. But not a bad product, everybody's hair is different!"
5,"Love, love, love at 1st sight!","The leave in conditioner is the best product for curly hair that I have ever come across, and I am 32 years young. When I purchased it on vacation in Miami and realized I could still have a good hair day, in spite of the humidity and long hours on the beach, I was hooked!!"
1,NOT FOR ME,"This product is not for everybody. I am black with biracial parents. I have naturally curly, wavy, and straight patterns of hair on my head, but mostly curly. I shampooed and conditioned my hair. Afterwards, I sectioned my hair and used a substantial amount of the leave-in conditioner. I allowed my hair to air dry. This product made my hair look dry and kinky. It also made my hair feel dry, like it was coated with something or had a residue on it. Maybe, I used too much, I don't know? I wish I had not purchased the large bottle. This product has a great smell, but it is not for me! Nevertheless, I guess I will have to keep spending money, until I find what works for me! The next product on my list to try is, Designline's ""Curl Lock""."
5,Works for my Extremely curly hair,"I have extremely curly hair that tends to run really dry. This is one of the only products I've found that manages the curls well (shapes them together they're not just frizzy looking and tangling easily) and also leaves it soft to touch - not crunchy or greasy or otherwise weird feeling. I will say the first time I tried it was when a hair stylist put it on after cutting my hair and it did feel a little crunchy before I got home, re-wet it and brushed it through while it was still wet. Now I use it every day and I always put it in, then brush it through while still wet and its always soft when it dries. Also, a little goes a long way."
5,"Works great even on blonde, thin, limp hair!","I read the reviews on this product over a year or more ago, and it sounded too good to be true for a Caucasian girl with fine, limp hair. All I need is a dollop and my hair comes to life, in springing, soft curls that do not leave any crunchiness or greasy residue. If the frizz is too bad, I live I'm Florida, simply wet my curls and scrunch again, rearely do I need to add more product. This leave in conditioner is my best friend now!PS... If you use too much, and it's not drying for you, use a blow dryer very quickly, no more than a minute depending how thick your hair is. The curls will become soft and frizz free."
3,"Good detangler, bad moisturizer","I am a mom of a biracial child with frizzy/curly thick hair. She has multiple curl patters. Using this helps detangle her hair, but the next day her hair is really dry. Mixed Chicks leave in works a lot better for us when we mix it with olive oil. I may purchase this again. Kinky Curly has worked a lot better for us in terms of detangling and moisturizing."
5,Awesome!,"Love this brand of products!More than worth the price and they work so well.I have mixed hair and finding products that work is impossible it seems! But mixed chicks??? they are definitely on to something, because it works!Smells great too!"
1,Not worth the $$,"I bought this leave in conditioner, and it wasn't any better than my $3.17 conditioner, actual that one works better. you have to use to much product to get a curl"
5,Great when used on Wet Hair!,"What a great product! I have a 7 year-old half black / half white daughter and it was a struggle for years to find a good product. Most products wore off by the end of the day, leaving nothing but dry, soft frizz; other products designed for Afro-hair were incredibly heavy and greasy, despite their claims. I'm ordering my second bottle of Mixed Chicks today after about 4 months of use - not bad for a 10 ounce bottle. I think the trick is making sure the hair is wet before applying (I use a spray bottle on sections of hair) - I find a little product goes a long way. Her hair is now completely manageable with soft ringlets - you can see the huge difference in her school photos! I don't know what I'd do without this product. Oh, and by the way, I don't bother with the shampoo and regular conditioner - I did not see a big difference compared to other, cheaper products. It's the leave-in conditioner that's key."
2,Got rid of the frizz...and the curl,"I have loose, frizzy curls that tend to be on the dry side. I asked a fellow curly girl what she uses and she told me about this product. I had seen it advertised in a magazine as well. I was excited about this product, hoping it would moisturize my hair while giving me great frizz free curl. The product did an excellent job at reducing the frizz in my hair. Unfortunately, it also weighed down my curls. I normally go three days in between washes, but by day two, may hair needed to be washed again. I looked at the ingredients and assume that the wax is what weighs the frizz and the curl down. I have tried putting less product in my hair, but to no avail. I still end up with flat, although frizz-free, hair.On another note, I bought this product from the Mixed Chics website. An ad in a magazine said I would get 10% off when entering a promotional code. There was no place to enter the promotional code, so I put it in the comments section. I never got my 10% discount."
2,Not for everybody 4b/4c,"When I used this product, I noticed a scent similar to relaxers(like chemicals). My hair type is 4c crown and 4b edges. I didn't see a difference than other leave-in conditioners. When I washed it out 2 days later, my hair had excessive shedding like I had when relaxers were being washed out of my hair. Since going sulfate-free, I observe the amounts of shedding that I have because the difference has been that I shed at least 60 percent less hair. With this wash, I saw more shedding than I have ever seen since going chem/heat/sulfate free. I will be giving this to my friend who recommended this product and not using it again. I gave it 2 stars because the childrens leave-in works well on my daughter's 3c,4a hair."
2,Didn't do anything for me,"I have wavy hair that will hold a curl if I curl it, but it gets very frizzy when it is humid out. I figured I'd try this since it got a lot of good reviews. I didn't really control the frizz and when I curled my hair it didn't seem to get as curly as without the product - as another reviewer said, it seems to weigh down the curls. I've tried it multiple times now following the directions and adjusting the amount but it just isn't right for me."
3,not bad,"i had previously used samples of this in the shampoo and conditioner. works wonders for keeping natural hair hydrated and not too heavy. i searched high and low for products to use on my daughters hair. we've tried carol's daughter, dark and lovely, different brands of sephora and finally came to mixed chicks. while i am not blown away by it it's definitely better than alot of other products i've come across. however, my search definitely hasn't ended...."
4,Hankies for projects!,These Hankies are not bad but so difficult to make the holes for Crocheting the edge but it can be done.
4,This album is very nice,"I just heard about Drums & Tuba a little while ago and I decided to check out their latest. I was very suprised, this album knocked my boots off my feet! Drums & Tuba combines every musical genre you can think of, including funk, rock, marching band, electronic and creates there own style uncomparable to any other band's. Every song on the album creates a different atmosphere, yet I cant help grooving out to every single tune on the disc. Also, listening to the tuba play intricate basslines blows me away, mainly because I have never heard a tuba play this type of music. Give this disc a listen, it is very hard to not be intrigued by this band's mystique."
4,Among the classic films starring older actors,When I taught 'Psychosocial Aspects of Aging' this was among the films they chose to see in which the main characters were older actors (along with other films like 'Trip to Bountiful' 'The Grey Fox' and 'Harold and Maude.')
4,Surf the Highway,"Want to temporarily forget the misery of your tedious existence? Plug in Brother Noland's music. It will take you on a mini-vacation. His music is thoughtful and fun at the same time. Having been raised in So Cal, where summers were spent at the beach, married a surfer guy, and having seen Bro Noland in concert, you can't help but sing with the stars when you listen."

4,Golf Bag,Talking alarm clock is attached to my golf bag to keep me informed as to the temperature and time while I am on the golf course. It serves the purpose. I am pleased with this purchase.
2,Not for first time parents,"This DVD is doesn't offer useful information for first time parents about pregnancy and childbirth. It does show women having babies, but no tips, how to prepare, or what to do if."
1,"Might as well buy free ""Alice"" program","I got this as a gift and expected it to be able to utilize your own work easily, draw your own things, etc. It's very difficult to figure out and you can only manipulate their [incredibly lame] characters. It's a waste of money, you might as well be using the free online ""Alice"" program, which does the same thing."
3,Not really for professionals,"I've only had this software for about a few months now, and while I really like the effort put into this, I really think mysmith micro could have done alot better. I have made a few animations with this thing, and after the first few videos I basically relized there are ALOT of limiting factors with this. Overall, my biggest disapointment with this is that whenever you create bones for a character and you may want to put some sort of object in front of you and one hand may be in front of it, but you want the other hand behind it to make it look like your character is holding it. Instead, you would either have to only use one hand and leave the other in an akward position, or, even worse, you put that object with your collection of other vectors in the bone section, and when you don't need it, it would still follow you anyway whenever you move the character. Overall, it does good for the concept, but it should have been released with more useful features."
4,Good but confusing,"This product does everything that it says it does, however, to do some things are really difficult. I suggest (as boring as it may be) that you take all the tutorials before really getting started because the program does so much. Also, the video files are so large and take forever to download to the internet. Don't even bother trying to send it via email. The program is really good though and does a lot so if you want to do anime proffessionally then this is a perfect program."
1,WARNING!,"This was a huge waste of money. If you have plans to make a custom animation, do not buy this. Anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters. You can not change eye color or hair color. If you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $10- $20. Their free ones are completly dumb. Using their ""easy to use"" bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use. It took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure. (which didn't work very well) You can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version. I spent hours trying to use this, and could figure none of the above out. It also took two weeks to get here instead of four days. I don't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator."
3,Pretty good Animation software with clumsy drawing tools!,This animatiion software is good if you want to do animation with photos but lousy when it comes to drawing characters and backgrounds. It's an improvement over it's clumsier predecessor Moho but I recommend Motion Artist over Anime Studio|5.
2,Anime Studio 5,"I bought the program for my 16 year old son. He gave me the 2 star rating. He said that it was difficult to use, it did not meet his expectations."
3,In need for a better tutorial,"Anime Studio 5 is a good beginner software for cartoon animation. However, the tutorial and instructions are deficient. They even describe functions that are not available and you will only find out (and stop searching) if your check their website for the FAQ!"
4,We Go to Mass--very reverent,"I think this book is quite beautiful and reverent. The handle makes it easy to carry for a toddler. The words are brief and to the point. The colors are bright. The people do not look sad, but serious and prayerful."
4,nice and glossy,"in my last job they always freaked if i put on anything remotely electronic, ""ooh I'm at a rave"", yawn. they liked this a lot. you can just leave it on in the background and it makes things purr right along, or you can crank it up and enjoy the fine production. plenty of gems."
1,Light switch,"I purchased the light and the switch worked only a few times, we hadn't even removed it from the packaging when it quit working. I think I would have liked it but I really didn't get to find out because the switch quit working so quickly."
3,3 out of 4 work okay,"Bought 4 for self, family, and friend. Three work fine and hold charge well. One works some of the time. Still holds charge, but switch appears faulty. Cost was too cheap to deal with sending it back, but not so cheap I won't complain a little here."
5,No More Batteries,"We own two of those. Just a few days ago we had a tornado warnings, and we lost the power almost a whole night. We were so glad to have the light. It gets dimmer in time, but you can crank it again and back to the brighter light. If you have little kids, they would like it and it might be helpful for distracting them from the fear of darkness. We will probably get lantern or oil lamps, maybe candles for hand free lights in case of longer blockout, but definitely recommend this one to start with."
3,"Cool batteryless feature, but weak light output","I bought this flashlight for my husband. While he loves the wind up feature and never having to replace it's battery, I noticed that the light output is not strong. While at first, it is bright, the flashlight quickly dims and the light output is very weak. Unless you continuously wind it up (which is bad for the flashlight), there is no strong light.I noticed this when we were renovating our bathroom. When you're looking in dark places (in between walls) at pipes, this flashlight was sort of useless because even with it on, one couldn't really see details like screws and such.While this might be a great flashlight if you're just walking outside and you don't mind a dimmer light source, this flashlight dims in comparison to the normal standard flashlight in light output.I am a little bit disappointed by this fact since I bought two of them. I rate this product 3 stars. Nice idea and design, but needs to improve in the light output category."
2,Not exactly over-joyed with it,"Firstly, I ordered two, and one came broken...one of the LED's won't 'illuminate' (...and at today's shipping costs, it isn't worth the price of sending it back for an exchange/refund). Secondly, I ordered this model because the photo showed it to be flat...which is what I needed...to easily fit in my car's narrow glove compartment. But I received an 'updated' model which is much bulkier, and won't fit in my glove compartment (along with all my other stuff.) As for the light output and duration, I read (from the 'Amazon reviews') that it's better than the Illuminator brand, but my Garrity dims quite a bit after 15 minutes. However, I also bought the simialr and larger Duracell '2-pack' crank light, and I would rate this less-expensive Garrity higher than the more expensive Duracell crank light."
3,No More Dead Flashlights,"This product is great in that I will no longer reach for a flashlight only to find it dead. The light could be a bit brighter, but overall a good product."
4,No batteries required = Saving money and the environment,"I purchased this flashlight for emergencies and regular use. The fact that it does not require any batteries is a major plus for me. The light is bright and works well without too much cranking. The unit I received says ""up to 30 MINUTES of light"" and NOT 60 minutes of light as advertised in Amazon, but I think 30 min is more than enough for me. The only thing missing is a strap or a belt clip thats why I am giving it a 4 star.I highly recommend it."
5,Great for emergencies.,"There are some streets that are very dark at night -- especially during Winter. This flashlight has kept me from tripping and falling. It doesn't need batteries because it is rechargable by cranking it.So far, I'm very satisfied with it."
3,"Pretty good, but not the best","It's pretty good. It's bright enough and stays charged for a while. But I think theKaito KA404 Emergency Hand Crank Dynamo 5-LED Flashlight with AM/FM radiois better, especially as an emergency flashlight. It's smaller, has a built-in radio, and is quieter. It sounds funny to mention how loud it is, but in comparison the Garrity is really loud, and it's annoying once you get used to the Kaito."
5,Kids absolutely love these,"Let's see, what would one need to know before investing a few $$ in a flashlight...- good, ergonomic and nicely designed shape, fits well in my palm- of course, no batteries to change or charge so there's one less worry- the crank is easy to turn and, so far, the body is not cracking or falling apart because of the stress- the LED's project nice, bright, bluish-white light- you have 2 brightness modes: a 1-LED and a 3-LED mode- durableI bought 2 of these, some 4 months ago and they are still working well, as good as new.The negatives? I can't think of any."
2,Not a good quality item,"If you are planning to buy this light you should know the real facts: It does work as indicated, however, the light beam is not that powerful (I've seen smaller LEDs perform a lot better) and the build quality is not that good (I've used mine only a couple of times and the crank shaft cover made of rubber is already falling off). It costs less than US$9 so you cannot expect Swiss made quality though.For the money, it's not bad. However, I would spend a little more and buy a better light."
2,Get what you pay for,"The flashlight functions ok but it appears to made out of cheap materials and light is really weak. I was also using a cheap battery powered flashlight, that turned out to be far more powerful."
3,Warning on durability,"this is an excellent product but should have come with a warning about how fast to crank itI cranked it too fast (>6 rps) and the gears came loose, now it is basically worthlessYou should be fine if you just crank it under four rps"
5,Best little flashlight on earth,"This past Wednesday, the Southern Tier of New York State and Northern PA experienced major flooding, the worst this area has ever seen. We were one of the lucky ones. Our home sustained absolutely no damage, but we were without electricity for over 3 days. My husband just got this flashlight as a birthday present the Saturday before the floods. This proved to be very handy. The light is bright and it illuminates for quite a distance. Also, the LED light is truer for color. When our other rechargables were used up, this one was still going strong. I plan on buying several more, one for each vehicle and three more for the house. I will never be without it."
2,Maybe I just got a lemon?,"Based on the reviews of this flashlight, I believe this is probably a very good value. However, on the one I received, the crank mechanism broke after testing it a couple of times. Other than that, it appears to be well designed and I might even buy another one and see if I have better luck. All of the good reviews can't be wrong. I just thought my experience was worth documenting."
1,"works great at first, then won't work later unless constantly cranked","We bought several of these (in a couple different brands) and have found that after a year they all have the same problem; they will no longer hold a charge. At first they were great- used them for camping and thought they were wonderful. Then we put them away and didn't need them for several months. When we recently had a power outage, we found that the flashlight wouldn't stay lit unless it was constantly cranked! This is way more work than we hoped. We'll go back to the battery kind so we have something that works for that occasional emergency."
2,BEWARE: Not As Advertised!!,"I ordered two Garrity Power Lites based on the reviews here.BUT the packaging on the lites I received says ""Up to 30 MINUTES of light"" and NOT the 60 minutes of light as advertised in Amazon."
3,Disappointment,"I ordered three of these flashlights a few weeks ago, and I haven't had much chance to use them yet, but when I tried them out when I first got them, I was disappointed at how weak the light was and how quickly it died. My brother has an L.L.Bean crank-rechargeable flashlight that looks very similar to this one, but its light is much brighter."
3,Garrity Power lite,"Seems to work ok.I don't think it puts out as much light as other ""LED"" flashlights but for the price, it will work!If you need a cheap flashlight that doesn't need batteries,this one will work ok for you"
5,Great Crank Light,I got one of these flashlights for myself because I never seem to have a good battery when I need one. I really like it. It's so reliable. I bought a lot of them and gave them as Christmas presents and they were a big hit. It seems a lot of people have the same trouble with batteries that I did. These flashlights are small and fit into your glove box in the car too. What a great gift idea.
3,Not that great,"While the item functioned mostly as described, the beam was very focused and not very bright. It might work in an emergency situation that does not need a bright or wide beam. I got mine for $11, now that I have used it, I would only pay maybe $7 or $8. Overall not bad and not good."
3,does the job,"As wind-up flashlights go, this one is fine. It is harder to crank and not as bright as the Wind-n-Go, which I also have. Don't know about run time, but it works for small jobs."
3,love the idea of a crank,I love the idea of a crank flashlight. I purchased this for my bug out bag. Light is not as bright as I hoped. It does get brighter if you turn the crank while the light is on. Couldn't sleep the other night and decided to use the flashlight to wander around in the dark instead of disturbing others. I noticed that it cast a small circle on the ceiling with a large rectangle shadow. I think the plastic cover diffuses the light causing it to be not as bright as it could be. I will still use it for my bug out bag but will probably throw a second flashlight in there as well.This is not a large flashlight nor heavy but was still not very comfortable to hold. Given the design it should be very comfortable to grip. I think it maybe would fit better in a guy's hands than a woman's. Over all I am not disappointed in the purchase.
4,Garrity Power Liet Crank,The shipping on this item was very speedy ordered it fri. received mon. packaging was good. Only gave it 4 stars because the lite power is weak. Great item and recommend if u don't expect a bright lite.
4,Easy & Bright,This light is very easy to use and bright. It has a nice grip and is quite light weight. This is a great product to have in case of black out or emergencies that requires lighting.
4,Well made flashlight for the price,"The flashlight appears to be well made, and provides a fast charge with a minimum of cranks, of course the battery is new. It has two on setting, the first button activation give you a high beam setting, the second a low beam setting. Not sure why they thought a low light setting was necessary, as it means you have to press the button a third time to shut the light off. It is a good, well made product worth the price."
3,Crank flashlight,"The crank flashlight doesn't hold power for more then 4 minutes of constant use. Within 1 minute the brightness diminishes considerably, I am sure technology will improve and make it brighter and last longer."
5,LOVE IT! GREAT FOR KIDS AND EMERGENCIES!,Great light and never needs batteries. Handle is simple to crank. My 3-year old loves it and uses it everynight. This is a great light. Pretty bright and seems durable. Would buy another one!
4,MacKay at the top of his game,"This is a stunningly beautiful production from the woods of Western Massachusetts. Cowboy hats off to Bruce, to all the Musicians involved, and to Mark at Signature Sounds. Obviously to me, at least, the previously posted negative review was submitted by the tone-deaf heckler whom Bruce humiliated at a live show some years ago."
5,I am Happy I finally found a place that carries this book.,I am grateful when I see how many people Read this book. I am one of Dan's nieces. He and I had a special bond through sports. Dan was a good man. I hope many young athletes read his book. - Breanne Quisenberry
4,Riveting and thought provoking.,"This legendary baseball player delivers images via his words that fans of his era can connect with. Who would think that Ben Oglive could be a focal point of poem, ""ode to ben oglive""."
1,Save your money,"Contains basic material from CDC, NIH, WHO, etc., all of which is taken from the web with little to no specificity toward Avian Influenza; no deep coverage. Use your favorite search engine, you'll be glad you did."
2,not what i thought it was:(,"this cd is good, but i should have read it better, i thought it was a soundtrack for scrubs:("
3,"Well Researched, Awkwardly Written Biography","This academic biography of Miguel de Cervantes is very enlightening when it comes to the facts surrounding his life and times. It traces the influences from his personal history that manifest themselves in his writing very effectively. The book is alternately engaging and frustrating in the following sense. While I learned a great deal not only about Cervantes but also about 16th and early 17th century Spain, there were passages where Professor McCrory's phrasing and writing style seemed disjointed and difficult to follow. Overall, I would recommend the book to those with a serious interest in the life of Cervantes or the period of Spanish history covered but I don't think this is a great choice for the general reader."
2,Disappointing Biography,"Better off calling this Cervantes's wikipedia page filled in with more detail.Awkwardly written. Lots of ""however"", ""nonetheless"", and other 8th grade writing transitions.Fails to take a stance of why Cervantes became the author of Spain's bible. Or what he represented.Provides unnecessary background information to the nth degree. The first half of the book is relentless in pushing Cervantes to the background amid extraneous detail.You get all the facts, but nothing touching the essence of the man. Stick to Don Quixote. We shall await a biography worthy of the great man."
2,Reel to reel,"I bought this on a lark just to see the reel to reels used in the film (I use them). I wasn't disappointed, but the movie was certainly not one of Connery's best. It's one of those movies that exploited current technology of its day, but looks ridiculously inept by today's standards. Any movie that jumps on the technology bandwagon will look dated in ten yrs-it's just a chance the producers take. It's definitely a walk down memory lane, but not any sort of defining moments in movie history fare."
5,Post James Bond!! Love this movie,I have to say that Connery really made his mark and separting himself from the James Bond series. This is a good action crime thriller.
4,The Anderson Tapes,I bought this movie about a year ago in VHS format its before I bought my newHDTV. I couldn't find the movie must have misplaced it along the wayso I reordered it this time in DVD format that movie hold up today as it did when it first came out I can really pick them I would still give this movie ****stars and it looks real good on my new HDTV.
3,Welcome to the Annoying Sound Effects Club,"Quincy Ones did the soundtrack for this movie... Not sure if he too was responsile for the various sound effects, but whoever was responsile should be kicked repeatedly in the backside.Every. single. time. a piece of technology was shown, an accompanying set of SFX was BLASTED out... pips, pops, squirly-tones, old-age computer sounds etc.OMG... it was senough to make me want turn this all off after just 30 minutes... Oh wait, I did..."
4,Excellent movie,"Notable flick. Fast paced armed robbery thriller driven by an ultra funky Quincy Jones soundtrack. Very good direction, and an all star cast make this movie an eminently good choice. I believe this was even Christopher Walken's first film. Sidney Lumet's style is unmatched as the fast paced editing follows the excellent soundtrack.One of the favorable heist films ever made in my opinion."
4,"Wow, Sean Connery.","Holy Christ is what I was thinking during Dyan Cannon and Sean Connery's scenes together. I can see why this movie still has fans despite it being a 70s film. It has authentic and unattainable New York real estate as the setting and a cast of residents who could have been understudies for the neighbors in Rosemary's Baby. Everybody is VERY weird in that 70s weird and the decor is astonishing. I'm sure if Aliens visited us during the 70s, they turned back around shaking their heads.Omigod, Christopher Walken actually looks angelic but still disturbing. Somehow his weirdness takes the edge off of how perfect looking his natural looks are.I can't believe any one let alone multiple agencies would bother with a thief like Sean Connery but that's how the movie gets its title - the Scotsman is under surveillance."
4,Fast moving MELODRAMA,"Sean Connery plays an ex-convict quick to organize a complicated burglary in his ritzy girlfriend's apartment building (Dyan Cannon). Unbeknown to Connery or the police, a third party is taping events throughout the apartment building.Permission to do the burglary is received from the local organized-crime figure but requires that he take along one of their men and that Connery kill him. What is more colorful is that Martin Balsam plays a faltering fag and Christopher Walken a safe cracker, both members of the gang. This is Christopher Walken's earliest known movie.All-in-all the film is solid entertaining and worth the price."
3,check first,"This is a well made product, but empire apparently doesn't think that anyone knows how to check the accuracy of a level. They also don't know how to build them accurately on a consistent basis.I checked 10 levels before I found one that was good on 2 vials& close to correct on the third.It is a sturdy piece but don't buy one without checking it. If you don't know how to check a level simply hold it to a flat surface (doesnt matter if it is level or plumb, close is good enough)see what the vial reads, then spin the level 180 degrees, side to side not top to bottom. The vial should say exactly the same as before. Check all the vials. Just because one is right doesn't mean the others are."
2,Won't buy again,"I was initially impressed with the low price and seemingly high quality of this line of levels. I bought three. All have gone out of true, and the blue coloring in the vials has changed to clear, making the bubble hard to see. I'll be spending the extra for Sola or Stabila next time."
3,"Florida, Indians, the Mob",I have tons of Florida stuff on the shelf and in my Kindle. This was a good entry in a field that includes some pretty big guns.
3,It's okay,Being from Florida and visiting the Keys several times - this tale is somewhat unbelivable. Many of the scenic phrases were just boring and lengthy.
1,air conditioner,"I received this product via UPS heavy load. I set this thing up, in hopes, of a portable A/C for our kitchen...not good. One, it is way to big and bulky for any room. Two, the exhaust hose, that you are required to use, cannot be flexed in any way. In other words, the unit has to be at least 4-5 ft away from a window and sit in the middle of a room. The window attachment could not be set up in our wndow, if used, I had to hacksaw it to make it fit. I decided that it would not work for me. I then had to pay UPS to send it back, to the tune of 150.00! So, this is a product that cost more than 1/2 its price to return...so you better be sure its right for you.."
1,Not worth the price and awful tech support,"The unit does not cool as much as I expected. A 5,000 BTU window unit did much better and much quicker. It is the ducting kit that keeps it from cooling very well. That hose puts off a tremendous amount of heat. I saw one persons review and they had to actaully try and keep the duct hose cool?! I know it should get warm, but this one gets hot!The ducting kit for this is flimsy and does not install very well. Mine actually has a problem with one end of the ducting kit. So I contacted them via e mail on their website, three times, not once did I hear back from them, not once. How does a company literally just ignore customer requests?! I was not asking for a new unit, i was asking for help with the ducting kit or at the very least a new ducting kit. Nothing, no response from them.I would not buy anything from that company again, ever."
5,Portable A/C,This arrived in a timely manner. It was packed great and it works wonderfully. I wish I bought it sooner. Great investment. Thank you for doing a great job.
1,SPT WA-9000E Air Conditioner,This product has a dehumidifier tank that fills in 4 to 6 hours. Once the tank is full the air conditioner stops working. It does have an option to install a garden hose for the drain water but who wants to deal with that. It is rated at 9000 BTU's but gives off less air conditioning than my 5000 BTU unit. If you are going to put this unit in place you will need to address the heat loss from the uninsulated vent hose.I was so disappointed with this unit I actually returned it for a full refund.
1,stopped working after less than 1 year,"Bought this for my son's bedroom as we cannot put any other kind of AC unit in his window. Product is huge and quite heavy. I found that while the product worked ok last summer, the temperature control was pretty much useless and it never really attained any selected temperature...it just blew cool air continuously even if I set the thermostat to 80 degrees or to 68 degrees. The room would get very cold.Unit was put into storage for winter and just put back into use last week. The unit no longer cools. Compressor comes on initially but then shuts down after 5-10 minutes. Calls to manufacturer are useless. Now need to replace this product.Overall a very poor experience."
2,dissapointed,not very colddrain hose kinks eaisly.i have a 5000btu that gets much colder.it is very quite though.
4,Easy to hook up,"Need to empty water basket about every 7 hours. Used in a 95 degree day in seattle and kept my room at 75 degrees. If you have 85 degrees coming in it comes out at 65 degrees. I wrap the hose in a towel and spray it with water. The trick is to keep the return air as cold as possible. I used tape to seal any holes and a small fan in the back so the air going in is as cold as possible.If I had to do it again, I would have bought a window AC, more efficient, less noisy, saves space and less expensive."
3,SIMILIAR MODEL,I HAVE ONE LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME BUT ITS A DANBY 8 000 BTU I HAVE A VERY SMALL ROOM 95 PERCENT OF THE TIME IT MAKES MY ROOM TOLERABLE CLOSE TO ROOM TEMPERTURE DOES NOT MAKE THE ROOM COOL IF ITS REALLY HUMID DAY NOT AS GOOD BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING I HAVE TO DUCT TAPE THE HOSE SO IT DONT COME OFFF NOT AS POWERFUL AS A WINDOW AIR CONDITONER IT SEEMS THE DEHUMIDIFIER THATS BUILT INTO THIS THING DOES MOST OF THE WORK I BLEIVE THESE 2 MODEL THE ONE I HAVE AND THIS ONE SINCE IT HAS A BUCKET THAT U EMPTY IS BETTER THEN THE OTHER ONES THAT DONT HAVE A BUCKET TO EMPTY THEY SHUT OFF EVERY 2 HOURS AND HAVE A SMALL WATER TANK U HAVE TO CONSTANTLY EMPTY
2,Pricey and not worth it!,"I purchased this air conditioner for a small mobile home. The BTU's should cool most of the area but it doesn't. Should have bought an air cooler instead because it would work just as well and cost a lot less! Also, it is not as portable as advertised...it's a real pain to move to another location!"
4,Portable,This is a well built unit and will cool a hot garage but it isnt very portable and the wheels dont help move it much..Too heavy for small rooms or tight space storage but it is a nice unit for the low price and Amazon is great about respecting the reurns if needed..This is the only thing I have every returned to Amazon in years of business w/ them. The refund was almost immediate and pick up made the return very easy..I rate this product a #8 only due to the large weight issue.
1,Swivel Kitchen Chairs.,"Purchased 2 sets of these swivel Kitchen Chairs. 4 chairs total. Arrived in good condition. But that is where it ended. 5 weeks after we started using them the weld broke underneath by the swivel. Its a point that was previously welded during manufacture. It simply was not welded 360 degrees around the shaft. A month later the second chair broke at the same spot. A call to Amazon and then to the second selling partner ""AtHomeMart"" brought me a quick reality check. Only 30 days return offered. No warrantee, no stand behind the product, NO NOTHING! Now the 3rd chair broke for the very same reason. POOR WELD!I live alone with my wife. 2 people and ocasionally some company. My last Chromecraft chairs lasted 10 years. This is pure junk and not worth buying. Seller doesnt stand behind its products and you are the looser. About $600 of a looser. AVOID. Pure JUNK>>>>"
1,Destroyed in Moments,"I have a 1-year-old husky-heeler mix, ca 40 lbs. So, not a large dog.According to the packaging, the strap on this product is ""durable and chew resistant."" Hardly. My dog chewed through the strap in less than 5 minutes. We had this in the house for less than an hour and it was already just a ball."
1,Waste of money..and...NOT SAFE!,"I normally give all dog toys a review..after I have had them a week...as...after a week you know how durable they are.i have a 60 pound sheepdog.I used this one for 3 days...I was playing catch from the pool with it..The tough handle is a great idea..and it is very strong and well made.The Ball...on the other hand...must be the cheapest thing they could find..as she cracked it open on the 3rd day..and was bleeding from her mouth due to the sharp edges..when it cracked open.DO NOT BUY FOR A LARGE DOG>try the Coleman toys..most are durable enough..and the strongest that I have found..But,I was looking for a pool throw."
4,History of the Jaguar car,Good reference on Jaguar history from Swallow sidecars topresent. Many black and white illustrations.
4,some gems,"The Cafe Apres Midi compilations can be real hit or miss c.d.s. They are compiled by Tokyo based DJs who seem to be vynyl purists (in some cases I can discern the presence of vynyl hiss and scratch coming off of LPs!) The collections invaribly include a lot of French pop tunes from the swinging sixties, and a lot of bossa nova. The real surprises come in the form of tracks like Thomas Dolby's ""Windpower."" (unreleased demo version) This one track redeems the entire compilation. Incidentally, the Apres Midi Music compilations are used by lunchtime cafe's through out Japan to provide a stylish retro laidback ambience. They're perfect for cocktail parties and Sunday brunches. Your guests will undoubtably ask, ""where did you get this music?"""
5,Boucher,"it is a very good book, with illustrations to color of great quality, and some drawings of Boucher.excelente considering the number of pages and the price."
4,Worked like a champ,I got the computer to charge up and hold a charge. Also ordered a replacement hard drive for the laptop and it worked great too. LOVE buying from amazon.com
2,expired,"Although the battery seems to work okay for now, the sell by date was in 2007 and I ordered mine December 2008"
3,Not as good as previous collections,"I usually adore Shaun the Sheep and was extremely excited to see a new collection; however, these fall short. My husband and I were debating whether their originality had worn off or whether these are just worse, and I think it is the latter. I still really enjoy previous collections and yet found myself wandering away in the middle of one of these stories."
4,Adorably Cute!,"I love the Shaun the Sheep series, I can't wait for new ones that come out. Who said this show was just for kids, I am in my 40's and love it!"
3,eh,"Eh. Not one of his better ones. Kind of stupid since they have clips and say for the full length go online. I spend $20+ on this and I should get all the footage, not have to go online to watch the end of it. This by far was not one of his better ones."
5,"Comfy, classy",Very nice looking professional shoes. The heel gives it a little extra oomph. Very comfortable.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!!!,"Bought this case thinking it was cool and inexpensive. Well, i got what i paid for. My phone (Treo 750) was very hard to slide in and when it was in all the way, the window part was crooked. No matter how much i fudged with it, it just would not align. All the other holes for buttons and volume control were also off. Did not return it because shipping costs incurred are not refundable. I ended up buying a silicone case...much much better."
2,Quite bulky,"This product didn't fit my Treo 680 so well. When you open the flap, there is a thin strip of leather that lands right on the red and green buttons. Its also quite bulky, when the phone is in use and the flap is open, it folds all the way back which makes it even thicker. But if you like hanging your phone on your belt, then it works quite well. The fit on my phone is not too well."
2,Dissapointed with Krusell,"I bought a Krusell case for my TREO 600 3 years ago and I loved it.But not this one for the TREO 680. It is made of hard leather, has over sized stitching that mars the back of the TREO case, and has no covering over the keys. It is also so tight fitting that I'm afraid to push the phone all the way into the case.Was very satisfied with Sfplanet's service and would buy from again."
2,Not for kids!,The previews make this moving look like a great kids movies - but I don't think it is - the girl dies and there is talk of child abuse. Prepare yourself and your child before you watch this movie.
3,Not exactly a fun movie,"It's a good enough movie but sad for kids. it doesn't really give a message, like some other childrens movies, except that everyone dies. Lot's to see as far as fantasy but there are plenty of other happy movies for 5 to 10 year olds to watch."
2,Avoid this film if your child is under 10!!!!,"This movie is good but has a sudden death of a main character in it and it really was upsetting to deal with for my 6 year old daughter who totally identified with the character. There should be a warning on the package! It does say it's PG but only mentions ""bullying, some peril and mild language"" as reasons for being PG. I didn't realize that ""some peril"" meant that I was going to have to explain that some children die suddenly out of the blue past the middle of the film. Unreal!!!"
2,Kooky and mildly pointless....,"Yes, I get it. Kids are supposed to be imaginative. Okay so why wasn't the story? You have AnnaSophia Robb staring (brilliantly I might add) in a flick about an adolescent with an overactive imagination... yet her imagination is depicted for all of 20 minutes in a 90 minute flick. The creatures are mindless cardboard cutouts, meant to represent real-life characters in their everyday world, but they wind up being boring parodies of themself.The movie had great potential. Lots of area for conflict, what with a controlling ""down on his luck"" deadbeat dad and all. But in the end, the film would have been better if it had gone unmade. Or perhaps benefitted from about another half hour actually IN Terabithia."
2,What A Dissapointment,"What a dissapointment of a movie.From the trailer it looked like a good fantasy movie.I thought it would be similar to the Neverending Story.It's a good thing I didn't pay money to see this movie.Take my advise,skip this movie!"
4,Surprisingly good,"Finally, a movie good for all ages that's not some Disney ""the world is a kid's utopia"". I knew that this was a movie made from a book and was shocked at just how well done it was. Hollywood has a dismal track record for turning books into movies, as we all know so well. The trailers do nothing for the movie either.Do yourself a favor, give this movie a chance, you won't regret it."
3,Not for Young Children,"Dumb me..I thought this was going to be a little delightful story or 2 children escaping to a fantasy land. WHat I got was a depressing study of bullying, disfunctional families, poverty, and worst of all DEATH!! Unless you want to be totally depressed don't get this movie. The acting was great though."
4,Bridge toTerabithia,We order this movie after watching the previews. When it arrived we watched it and the whole family enjoyed it.
5,Tear-jerker!!!,"I, for some reason, absolutely loved this movie! It was a great take on childhood friendships and where imagination can take them. I saw this when it came out in theaters and it was worth it! Very heart-warming story between two kid neighbors who become best friends. I loved that one minute I'm laughing and the next minute I'm pretty much bawling! lol. Great movie for the kiddos, sad in some parts though."
5,Good entertainment,I really enjoyed the movie. now I am typing to meet the minimum word requirement so Merry Christmas and Happy
3,Terrible marketing,"This movie seemed to be marketed as a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" style fantasy, with action and adventure. This is certainly not what is delivered. I purchased this for my 5 year old and he was very bored through the majority of the movie.That being said for older children I think it is a very good story. It teaches some good lessons and has a lot of imagination. The only part that concerned me was what seemed like a small slight at the Christian religion. The movie is a good place to have a small say on it, but I don't feel it should preach any particular view.All that said, I think the movie, by itself, was probably a 4 star. The movie with the marketing attached, misleading me into buying a DVD that our kids aren't even ready for deserves a 2 star. I split the difference."
5,Very Good Movie,"The Movie was excellent, the acting was very good. I was so enthralled with the movie that I probably might have missed a couple of little things that they didn't do an excellent job of but I can think of any. Excelent Movie. I laughed I cheered I cried and I thought about watching it again."
1,Yawn,The preview is more exciting than the movie. It is slow and dull. None of my kids would watch it. Will stick with Harry Potter movies.
1,BAD Disney Movie! SPOILER ALERT,It is not an innocent Disney-Fantasy. It is a tragedy (tragic play). SPOILER FOLLOWS.There is bullying throughout the movie. Then a teacher dating a student. And to cap it all off a dead leading character girl. It may be a great tragedy-movie. But it is really bad as a Disney-movie.
2,Not a bad idea for a story but....,"Terribly marketed and executed. I watched this on the plane and was interested throughout the movie, but when it was over, I could not help but think, ""What the heck where the writers doing here?"". First off, the advertising for this movie does not fairly indicate what it is. From the trailers you think that this is going to be a fantasy based movie with the majority of the story taking place in this fantasy land. That is not the case. The fantasy land is a very small part, and my interpretation of the movie is this is a story one of loss, and I dont believe this is the write setting to tell this story."
1,Horrible movie,"This is no wholesome Disney family movie!! The writeup should have warned us that one of the two main children characters dies. In addition, their was abuse, poverty, and very mean people. This is not a family movie to enjoy. It is very sad."
1,Excuse me? This movie stinks!,"Where do all these cerebral people come from who speak so highly of this dumb movie? My husband and I watched it not knowing about the tragedy that happens near the end. We absolutely hated it! We will never watch it again, and we've told everyone we know how hideous the movie is! There was no reason to kill off the sweet young girl who befriends the outcast boy. The ending was terrible! Unless you want to watch a movie that is depressing from the beginning, and ends badly--don't watch this one!!! Do you like to feel bad after watching a movie? Then this one is for you."
2,"Would have been a great movie, except for...","the last 20 minutes.Went to see with my 1st grader -- although the movie was nothing like the trailers made it out to be, we did enjoy it until the ending storyline.Why ruin such a good movie with an absolute depressing ending?It seems the writer was trying to make some kind of religious point (which is fine) -- it just didn't fit with the rest of the movie.Wish we hadn't seen it..."
1,please spare your children this movie!,"I just got the movie today to see with my children (9 and 6) for a special event on Mother's day. The movie promises to invite children into a fatasy story. Instead you get a MOST DEPRESSING movie about a boy and a girl being bullied around in school and the boy gets yelled at from his Dad and then all of the sudden the heroine dies!You keep thinking this is a Walt Disney movie for children, she must come back alive or something and so we watched it to the dreadful end. When the movie ends the boy finally enters the fantasy world that we waited for for 90 long minutes. Then he smiles even though his best friend is still dead and that is it.I cannot relate how anyone would want to see a downer like that."
5,Great Movie,"Well impressed with the service provider,received the movie in just a fewdays.All i can say the service in all ways met my expectations thank youagain."
3,"Decent Movie, Hardly Fantasy Though","Okay, so hands down NOT the movie to see just before launching an illustrious teaching career, a mite on the depressing side for that. Good movie. Definitely not as the trailer portrayed though... I was at least expecting some significant trip into this other world they create with their imaginations. Zilch in that regard. The plot twist concerning one of the characters was definitely sad but excellently done.Not exactly your ""yay, fantasy"" movie, but a decent story and a well spent hr and a half."
2,DVD Cover misleading,"I agree with the review below, although I know nothing about the book which this movie is based on. This was in no way a light hearted Fantasy. It barely has any effects or creatures, except for about 20 seconds at the very end.(when the DVD cover makes it look like ""The Neverending Story"") Definitely NOT for kids under 10, as this movie got pretty dark and depressing. Wayyy too many stereotyped characters that I did not care about. I just thought this was a really awful movie that is not for young kids."
2,good graphics but weird storyline,I watched this movie on the cable. It has good graphics but the plot and the story are pretty confusing. The girl who played the Leslie character did a good job. Other than that there is nothing much to watch...
4,Not your average kid's movie!,"OK, I'll put it this way. I'm a grown 50 year old man with tastes that run nowhere near a children's movie. I studied Ingmar Bergman in college and still hold the likes of Coppola, Scorsese and DePalma in the highest of regards. I like to think my favorite movies are artsy and challenging, but darn it, this movie had me crying like a baby! And I just couldn't shake the after-effects the next day and had to recount to my friends (and myself) just how powerful this movie was and how it ""got to me"". Maybe because it is such a coming of age story, and I felt every creak and groan of Jesse's growing pains and identified 100% completely with what he was going through. I'm not sure how this all translates to children viewers, seeing that I was reduced to mush by the end. But, like the other reviews say, if you want your kids watching this, be prepared for some hefty repercussions. It's that good!"
5,Bridge to Terabithia,"For a fanacy movie it is one of my favorites. The mind is an amazeing thing, this shows childrens minds go wild and off the chart. The visuals are great, the story and the Characters. This young lady does a knock out job with her Character. The theme song she does at the end is so inspireing. It will lift your spirits"
2,Not for Kids,"The commercials were very misleading. My grandson wanted to see it because the commercials showed trees that ""had eyes"" as he put it. We took him to see it and were disappointed because he is only 3 and the movie is really geared for older kids and adults."
1,Pointlessly depressing,"This film could have been almost acceptable as a tragedy, if there was a point to all the suffering. There wasn't. It could have been a kid's adventure move if the characters had been written to see anything remotely amazing or grow in any more meaningful way. Not so. It could have been a morality play if characters' intentional actions were linked to consequences. They weren't.As it is, the film is a vile protracted trudge through pointless suffering, punctuated by fleeting and insipid moments of sad fantasy by doomed characters. No good deed goes unpunished; all opportunities for growth are resolved in dime novel or mean-spirited fashions.If you love suffering, guilt, shame, futility, and incompetence set in an uncaring and malevolent universe, this is the film for you.I'm still retching.(As a postscript, the two young actors were excellent in this otherwise waste of an effort)."
1,Do not buy this.,"The kids were great actors, and the special effects were nice. However, this is not an enjoyable family movie."
1,Leave it here,"I love the fantasy classic films like The neverending story, The dark Crystal, Willow, and many others. But film is full of emptiness not fasination. The story is anti-climatic and holds no thunder."
1,Depreeeeesssing!,"I never read the book, so I watched the movie. When it ended, or even before it ended, I asked Why? What was the point? The young, beautiful heroine drowns toward the end of the movie. The depressed young boy then takes his little sister to the fantasy land and smiles and the movie ends. I could have done better. I would have brought Leslie back to life (as was Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and I don't know else, or better yet, let's not kill her and give the author a raspberry! Brrrrrp! Nahnah, nahnah, nahnah my movie is better than your book. Leslie lives, Leslie lives! Instead this book got the Newbery Medal which is awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children. Did they all forgot their childhood?"
2,Thank God I saw this movie as an adult,"I can only imagine all the little kids in the movie theater crying their eyes out as the sweet little girl cracked her head on a rock and drowned in the river. And did they have to bring religion into it? Since she wasn't a Christian, we can only assume that she is indeed burning in hell. This movie sends out a lot of negative messages to children like, if someone is bullying you, create fake documents to publicly humiliate that person.2 stars for the acting."
3,Misleading Previews,"The previews will lead you to believe this is a fantasy movie, with mythical creatures, etc. in a world that some children discover. Well, not exactly. I took my 5 year old to this thinking it was a fantasy movie but after waiting for the movie to move forward into the other world discovered that the movie had little to do with what was in the previews and was a story about a boy growing up and going through some difficulties. While the movie was very good for what it was, the previews mislead me and I was not happy. Very surprised my 5 year old actually sat through the whole movie."
1,False Advertising,"The previews tout this movie as 'A Fantasy film for the entire family'.This is a lie.There is very little 'fantasy' in the movie (I think maybe 15 minutes tops), and while the previews and commercials and trailers would paint it as a fun romp with two friends through a magical world, the truth is that it is a depressing and dark film. And I know at least one child that went to see the film and left crying because of it. Honestly, I think the producers should be sued for false advertising and misleading commercials. And I wish there was a lower rating than one star, because I would sorely like to give this a -5."
5,"Hmmm, Terrabithia, Dats a purty name for my next baby!",I bought this movie for my girlfriend. She collects films aimed at a younger audience. Something to do with her social work and relating to her young clients. She loved it!
3,Ok,"The movie was ok, however, I was expecting to see a movie that was packed full of fantasy such as in Lord of the Rings albeit without the violence. That is what the previews show. Having never read the book, I relied too heavily on the previews to decide if I wanted to see it or not. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. The movie gave a great portrayal of how friendships are formed between kids and how one person's imagination can be seen when adequately described (such as reading a book). That is the only reason that I gave it 3 stars. Sitting on a bench at a park and watching all the kids interact is similar and much more entertaining than this movie. If you want a fun trip to a world of fantasy, don't rely on this movie to get you there. If you want a nice story about friendship, this movie is for you."
2,Not what you expect,We took the kids to this movie expecting something to the effect of Narnia - because when you see the reviews & trailers - thats what the kids are expecting and what it looks like the movie will be about. Everything you see for the advertisement as far as fantsy - thats it! The story wasn't bad - but its definately not what i or my kids expected - whats bad is - there were A LOT of small kids in the theater expecting somthing different - so as the story progresses and one of the main kid character dies - you think 'great.. this was suppose to be a fun movie i was taking the kids to see.' VERY disappointing.
1,Upsetting and terrible for kids,"Do not let your kids watch this movie. I am not sure what lesson it is supposed to impart. Well I do, but it is not successful. Everyone is mean, the kids, the teacher, the parents. And since when is killing off the 'good guy' and a kid at that I great idea for a kid's movie. I have not read the book (nor will I) but I am hoping it was better done than the movie. Acting on kids part was good but I never got into or understood Tarabithia and found the entire movie either boring or upsetting depending where we were. We will never watch it again."
5,Deals well with Bullying,This is a kind and warm movie that deals well with bullying and death. Performances are genuine and believeable. Even the fantasy blends well with the story line. There are several themes in this movie that adults will enjoy. Intelligent children will also find the plot exciting and engaging. My 8 year old girl loved it :).
1,"Very disappointed, waste of time and money","Disgusted is the term I would use for Bridge to Terabithia. I am tired of these ""not so subtle"" Christian morality intrusions into our films. The child's death is unnecessary to the story - her joy of living should have been celebrated. The author is the child of missionaries and originally planned to be one herself - this is made very obvious through the inclusion of a very awkward scene where the children go to church and then , out of the blue, have a strange, disturbing discussion regarding the nature of religious beliefs. The trailers and the film poster were very misleading - very little magic in this film. The film was slow, the lovely dips into the fantasy world were infrequent and not fully explored or explained. It cost us over 50 dollars to go to this movie (with babysitter for baby, etc.) and I feel very very cheated...(I will say that the two main child actors were delightful, especially condisering the horrendous screenplay)"
1,What fantasy????????,"The Fantasy here is that this is advertised as a fantasy. That's like saying the Nazis were goodwill ambassadors. I threw it in the trash after I watched it.Maybe the producers and I have a different definition of ""fantasy"". A general rule of fantasies is that you don't kill of your heroine right in the middle of the story. That's not a fantasy, that's real life.Whoever gave this movie 5 stars is either on the production staff, relatives of the child actors, or mentally disturbed.Yah, lets all go have fun watching a movie about people dying and call it a ""FANTASY"". Get the popcorn. Maybe they'll make another fantasy were more good people die. Make it real ""real-like"". Maybe have an airplane crash into a school. A real fantasy. Make you feel real good inside. Heeeey! That dude died reeeeeal good! That was fuuuuuun!"
1,whatdaheck?!!,"unreal. most boys if they had a chance to spend time with a hot little number in the woods would be playing doctor or strip oker, no fighting made-up monsters. if the kids were younger-- 6 or 7 if would be more believable."
2,Disappointing,"This movie is not at all what I had hoped it would be - a fantasy adventure movie for children. Instead, it basically seemed like another ""My Girl"". One of the biggest disappointments to me was the conversation that the children had when coming back from church. After reading so much about the connection between Bridge to Terabithia and Narnia, I was HUGELY disappointed that there were very strong statements against orthodox Christianity. God was portrayed as the ""big bad meanie in the sky"" who was unfair and therefore one was better not to believe in Him. This was certainly not what I was expecting to encounter when thinking that we were seeing a carefree children's movie. My first reaction was to want to get up and walk out of the theater. This is certainly not a Christian-friendly movie, regardless of who it is produced by."
2,Terabithia is all imagination!,"I went into this movie also thinking that the children would be visiting a whole new world not unlike middle earth or even narnia, but things started getting suspicious when they barely even mentioned or entered the world after 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) passed. I look up the movie on rotten tomatoes and lo and behold Terabithia is nothing more than an imagined world.I promptly turned it off as I felt deceived by the advertising and many of the portrayals of kids just weren't realistic. I usually always avoid movie synopses because they reveal everything - but in this case, I should've read it! This movie is about two kids growing up having to face countless bullies, school and family. It's a light hearted coming of age flick and if that rocks your boat then watch it!"
1,My Girl take two,"Don't be misled by the posters, this is just an updated version of a script done long ago. Nothing special, a real let down considering the great Narnia movie."
2,Not For Children - Depressing,"Sorry.. After watching this movie, I have to agree with the negative reviews. Note..I have not read the book, but I imagine it is close enough to the plot.. Bottom line is that this is not a fantasy movie for children, as many would assume.. Yes there is fantasy and, yes, the main characters are children, but.. the story turns very depressing and basically becomes a character study of how one of the characters deals with a major tradgedy. There is not much to gain from this film and I found it to leave the viewer disappointed. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is that I found the two young actors (Josh and AnnaSophia) to be convincing. Again.. Sorry."
2,Big disappointment,"I love sci fi and fantasy. The ads indicated this would be a great fantasy, but the element of magic was very limited . It was a nice story and heartwarming, but not at all what I expected based on the ads."
4,Sad coming of age drama.,"This movie is a sweet, but sad story of a dreamer boy who is building a wall a round his heart and an adventurous girl who reaches out to him. Its beautifully shot with fantastic animals and lush green forests. The kids act real enough to be convincing. The only thing that I did not like was the way the ending was done it was heavy handed, and like a sucker punch got you while you weren't looking. My son watched it with me and we both were surprised at the movies ending. Overall I recomend it, but you may want too explain some parts to your children."
2,extremely emotional movie,"ok, I won't go into the plot or all the graphics which I thought were awesome and no, I did not read the book before we bought this movie so I had no way of knowing about the death which takes place halfway through the movie.As a mother who did lose a child tragically and my surviving son who lost his brother, this movie really did a number on us both. I really wish there'd been some sort of warning so that I'd known that there was a scene that would bring up the horror that I've already lived through once and had no desire to experience again - even in film!Otherwise, I do have to say I honestly enjoyed the relationship between the main characters and really loved how they created this whole imaginary world and could have really really loved this movie but again, the tragedy just destroyed my enjoyment of it and we weren't able to resume watching it after that.I'm giving it a 2 rating because of that one scene and how it detracted from our enjoyment."
3,Sure didn't think the movie would end that way,"My friend and I saw the movie. He loved it, I was stunned on the girl's death. Sure knocked the wind out of that movie as far as i was concerned, but my friend would give it more that 5 stars, he's that enamored by the movie"
1,Not a good gift for the kids,"Buyers beware! Don't be fooled by the commercials and deceptive marketing tactics used to promote this horrible film. If you've already seen this film and actually liked it, then go ahead and buy this film. However for those who had not seen this film, be warned that this movie is no Narnia. What is seen in the commercial accounts for only 5 min of the film. The film is very slow moving which perhaps one could deal with it were not for the unexpected death of a main character. This is not a kid's movie. So unless you're ready to talk to you kids about abuse and death, you might want to leave this video where it belongs, sitting on the store shelf."
2,Not really a children's film.,"I bought this DVD as a flick some children I babysit could watch. Good thing I watched it before they did. I have to say it's not really a children's movie & it is a bit of a downer as well. The preview makes one think it's a real fantasy film but, alas, it's short on fantasy & humor. NOT a feel good movie, IMHO."
3,Not Chronicles of Nardia,"Good idea but misleading trailers. This a very heart felt movie, but it does not live up to the fantasy aspect. Total fantasy scenes about 20 mins... Red Box it..."
1,"Disappointing fantasy, jarring reality","To paraphrase the quote of a old playwright ""In my youth, I loved writing tragedy, until I learned that life was quite tragic enough without my adding to it."" The creators of this movie would have done well to remember that, because unlike Narnia, you will leave movie this dragged down and not lifted up. If you hold a Christian faith, you'll also wonder why the movie takes a gratuitous swipe at God and those who hold religious beliefs. You'll not leave with any real since of wonder at the fantasy world of Terabithia, because it simply has no depth. Most of the action occurs at a small public school and in a depressing, poor family's home with the stereotypical overbearing father and distracted and aloof mother. The imaginary play between the two main characters stretches the movie's credibility even further, with poor development and/or explanation. In short, if I saw this movie on broadcast television, I would channel surf right past it."
1,Anti-Christian movie,"Right in the middle of the movie your child will face a mockery on Christianity from someone who apparently has no idea what Christianity is about. They pervert and make fun of the profound Christian teaching which they can't get. They could well not bring it up in the movie, but no, they think that their brilliant ideas are so valuable and smart that they have to spread them out on innocent minds. This is called cheating and robbery. Don't let your child to be robbed by this Walt Disney movie."
2,let down,"This movie is like three films in one. The fantasy part is very small and has very little to do with the main plot. Although I'm not sure what the main plot is? That we should live in an imaginary world to escape thecruel one we really live in?Alot of unrealistic things in this movie and I don't mean the Fantasy parts.1. Grades K-8 in the same school?2. A young female teacher taking a male student out alone on a saturday?3. Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb would never have been considered ""losers"" in any school I've been to.This movie is depressing and falls short of tying all the elements together. And once again Christianity is attacked by Hollywood.I read AnnaSophia Robb is a Christian, I'm surprised she would except the lines given to her in the scene after Church. The kids have a poor understanding of the Gospel the way they explain it."
4,Happy,The reciepient of this cd was very happy to get it for Mother's day and loves this movie very much.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Bridge to Terebithia is two movies: a sweet and tender story of friendship based on the classic novel, and an unwieldy CGI creation that sits at right angles to the main story rather than enhancing it; the movie may still appeal to children, but as an adult I found that the special effects dragged on far too long and severely hindered the film."
5,Great Service!!,"Thanks for my copy of ""Bridge to Terabithia."" It arrived quickly and in perfect condition! My second graders will be watching it this Friday! Thanks again!"
4,This is an award winning children's book.,"Sometimes as a librarian, I find a movie better that the award winning book. This was the case with this movie. It shows the compassion that children can exhibit to one another. The movie arrived in great condition and I really enjoyed it."
3,You have not stumbled into Narnia--don't believe the trailer,"This is a coming of age movie, and as that succeeds well. However it is NOT a fantasy movie as portrayed in the trailer: the fantasy elements only make up about 10 minutes of movie time.Take your pre-teens, not your younger kids looking for a good fantasy."
3,"Warning - sad movie, too sad for kids","I wish someone had warned us! My daughter and I balled our eyes out. Other than that really sad part, the movie was great, but just to forewarn you...bring your tissues!"
2,WHAT was that!?!?!?!?,"This really was a great movie, and I do highly recommend it for anyone who knows what's coming - a coming of age story about a young boy and girl facing the tribulations of growing up and public school.BUT that was NOT what Disney advertised. I bought this based on the disney advertising to watch on a lark with my young daughter. We both sat there on the couch with our draw dropped in shock. My daughter kept asking over and over and over, when does Leslie come back to life! This was NOT appropriately marketed.A great movie - had my daughter not watched it - with terrible TERRIBLE marketing."
2,Not happy and fluffy,"I watched this movie with no knowledge of the plot. I should have done my research before watching it with my 5 and 10 year old as they were both mortified by the entire film...kids are constantly bullied and pushed around and other horrible things. Honestly, real life is NOT this bad.The movie itself looked nice and the actors/actresses did a fine job."
4,who needs reality when you have your imagination.....,"Very simple basic movie. Perfect for a Disney.It doesnt seem like its all that because I think some believe your going to escape in this fanasty world that truely exist but it only is a child's imagnation bringing a world of their own to life.I remember those days as a kid and it was a form of escape. Now days, it seems television or video games are the way.... So if you were one of those kids out there imagining your own world.... you will understand and apprecaite the movie probably more so than those who dont.I will be buying this one, because I liked what the story line stood for. There is a lot of meaning in this movie and situtions I think was faced growing up"
4,Not for very young Children to enjoy like preview makes it out to be,"I dont think young children under the age of 8 would sit and enjoy this movie. I certainly enjoyed it but the previews make it look like it is a fantasy like movie (sorta like Labrynth) but they will be let down. Although this is a good story, the previews are misleading. I know I will get comments on this but, its the truth, Awesome storyline but again, probably not good for young children to sit and enjoy. Kind of like Spiderman for little children..it is great but I think kids would rather see spidey the whole two hours and a half in costume swinging around and the rest of the adults enjoying the storyline"
1,sucks,i hate to say it but its a big let downits really depressing and sad movieabout hour and 20m it builds up then drops and your like what just happeni hate to say but the little girl dies sorry after that happeni hate this movie
2,Bridge to Terabithia,"I was very disappointed with this movie it wasn't at all what I expected, my kids were so looking forward to seeing magical creatures and mythical figures similar to Lord of The Rings but not so large scale. How disappointed they were when the seeing of these imaginary characters were few to say the least and mainly at the end. I found my nine year old twins getting bored and restless, when usually they will sit through this type of movie, it was I think a little boring and over the heads of some kids. I was also surprised at the early departure of some movie goers due to the younger ones being fidgety."
1,Disappointed in Disney,"I've never written a review, but feel compelled here. The fact that it was depressing set aside (if I want this type of tragedy, I'll watch the evening news), I was disappointed in some of the lessons taught.Specifically, making revenge look good is not a good ethic to teach your children. I had hoped that Jess and Leslie were somehow different from the other kids and above doing that. Also, I felt the movie made light of the situation where a child confesses her father has beaten her. Children should learn that a situation like that should be reported to a trusted adult."
3,"Good HD, So-So Movie","The Blu-Ray audio/video quality was very good. The movie was alright. I feel bad for this generation of kids growing up without the truly imaginative movies we had like the Neverending Story, the Dark Crystal or Labyrinth. I watched Arthur and the Invisibles and thought it to be a much more interesting and fun movie. Save for its adult themes I think Pan's Labyrinth is a better fantasy/kid-has-to-face-reality movie."
3,Could have been great,"I agree with the reviewers who say that this film doesn't really know what it wants to be. I must say that after watching it, I would not place this in the fantasy genre. I mean, it has it's fantastical elements, but when you get down to it, it's more of a friendship film with a great imagination. The two leads do a remarkable job portraying middle school kids who form a type of bond dealing with an imaginary world. Its actually very sweet and sentimental. That aspect of the film really is what makes it worthwhile. I found that when they introduce the fantasy elements, the film lost it's trail of thought. I'm aware this is based off a book, and maybe the book portrays things better. But as a film, it doesn't quite work. Still worth a look. It does have an unexpected ending which caught me off guard. Its a very bittersweet sort of film."
4,Bridge to Terabithia- amazing!!!!!,"I purchased this movie at the perfect time. My sixth grade students had just finished reading the book in class. Automatically, the two teachers in the room put our heads together and thought about some kind of extension activity we could plan for our students. Jackpot!!! We used this movie to allow the students to compare and contrast the movie and the book! Lesson turned out well!"
1,Died after 2 months - lifetime warrantee is worthless,"I purchased a PQI memory card and it died after about two months.Although PQI advertises a lifetime guarantee on their memory products and their website has you fill out an RMA request form and email it to them as an attachment, the email address they give is invalid. All subsequent emails to PQI regarding the invalid email address and warrantee processing were not responded to.According to the Better Business Bureau ""this company has an unsatisfactory record""."
1,Will not buy this make again,"I have previously always used Kingston memory without a problem. This was cheap, but looses the data as soon as it is removed from the device and often requires reformating. I tried with a PC, Camera and Palm; all give similar issues, so I know it is not a compatability issue."
1,"Died almost instantly, corrupted priceless photos",I owned this card in 2GB and 4GB sizes and can say from experience that it is by far the worst card brand EVER. Both cards have caused problems in my digital cameras. The read/write speed is inconsistent causing the camera to freeze and shut down. Trying to retrieve the pictures via a memory card reader was a nightmare. 95% of the pictures were corrupted and I lost priceless photos from a family vacation. Don't waste your money and go with a trusted brand like Sandisk or Kingston. Even HP is better than this.
2,No me gusta este libro,"I am a Spanish 2 student and had to read Susana y Javier for school. It is dull and essentially has no plot. It became a running joke in my class, and we are all grateful that we have finished it. Unless you enjoy a long, detailed account of very little happening, read another book."
1,Buyer Beware,This gets one star only because there is no provision for alower grade. The sound quality of this CD is terrible. It [sounds like it was] taped from a copy of the movie. There are more dialogue clips than music. The production standards are not particularly high...
3,Tense romantic suspense,"When Dr. Elizabeth Iverson returns from a party and finds her best friend murdered in her apartment, she turns to former flame Drake McGuire for protection. Drake is in town to see Elizabeth, who he has pined over since she fled his hotel room without explanation six years earlier.The sparks of attraction between the two fly from the moment that they lay eyes on each other. And neither wants to admit to the attraction. Drake is convinced that Elizabeth was the intended victim. Now, if he could just get her to take it all seriously and not try lose her bodyguard.Rae penned a quick-paced novel that is heavy on the sizzle and the suspense with an intriguing plot that could easily have become tiresome since the whole love child scenario has been done over and over. Readers will find themselves flip-flopping over who the bad guy (or gal) as this tense drama plays out."
3,ruined by a secret baby,"*sigh* @*#*$& secret baby plots. ARGH. I hate secret baby plots.And the fairly decent romantic suspense doesn't make up for it, particularly when the hero is too TSTL to even suspect. At all.Not to mention that the heroine had no good reason for keeping the baby a secret from him. GAH.The suspense/mystery itself was pretty good--heroine's a cardiologist, and she comes home to find her best friend, who'd been staying with her, murdered. Hero's an FBI agent.There's even a cute thread about one of the cops considering the hero a suspect.If you cut out the damn secret baby, I'd have loved this one."
5,Crusty Cynic Sheds a Tear,We most humbly suggest that Rebecca Moore's music is nothing short of spectacular. Our usual cynical wisecracking self was moved to tears by her incredible voice and inventive music. We wish we could articulate more clearly and wax on poetically regarding this CD but alas we stumble haphazardly from one word to the next unable to do it justice. We can only urge you to listen for yourself.
4,Easy and Efficient,"I gave my purchases as a gift, so I am not aware of the quality, etc. However, I was delighted to find what I wanted since I had been unable to obtain the Garner CDs in our town. The ordering process was easy, and the items arrived in time to gift them."
3,The gold at the end was missing,"This was not one of Fern Michaels best books. However, I do think the book is worth reading. The plot is workable and even enjoyable. It was just missing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
4,GOOD BOOK TO READ,This book was not as good as her others. Took a bit to get involved and intersted in this one. So be prepared to read slowly on the first couple chapters.
3,Great Quick Reference Guide,"Although this book is not an extremely detailed or long winded guide, it makes for a terrific reference guide. I work full time in the business office of a large surgical practice. I use this book almost every day! It's perfect for finding unfamiliar terminology. It was worth the [price]!"
5,v,another good book by Phil McGraw. bought it for a friend. arrived timely and in perfect condition as promised. will buy from this seller again.
2,Soiled fabric right out of the Box Twice!!,"I bought this cover and the fabric was soiled, like it was contaminated and it wouldn't wash off. I exchanged it and got the second was soiled also. (Same Thing)I just returned it and got my money back. I can't believe these people don't look at the items before they send them out,especially after one has been returned for the same problem. They act like we are just suppose to accept it when it is a brand new item. Keep making this crap overseas with poor quality. They will probably just restock it send it back to another customer. Bad service. At least check your stock to see if they are all like that and get rid of the bad ones. 2 in a row that were bad. Really got to watch what you buy on Amazon."
1,I think I got the wrong rain cover shipped to me.,The rain cover I got only covers the trunk bag when the side panniers are not deployed. I was expecting one that covered the whole works. So either the photo doesn't do it justice or perhaps I ordered or was shipped the wrong rain cover.
4,Topeak bag rain cover,"We felt the need to have this simply because you spend too much on the bag to not protect it from rain when you get caught out on the road. Seems to me this should be an included part of the bag purchase. Seriously, I bought a tank bag for my motorcyle and that manufacturer included it and as a package it could be sold a bit cheaper than ala carte. The cover itself seems to slip over the bag easily and does not appear it will come off by accident but thankfully we haven't had to use it yet. :-)"
4,"Careful, Not ""Greatest Hits""!! Probably ""In Action"" album","Solid Base released on January 23, 2002 (date mentioned by Amazon above) their latest album entitled ""In Action"" - with completely new tracks, most notable: ""Perfect Melody"" and ""This Beat of My Heart"" - Amazon may have been misinformed - the CD premiered in Japan - maybe it was the Japanese writing on the CD :o).I am not aware of any ""Greatest Hits"" release from this superb Eurodance group, and the date mentioned above is too eerily ""coincidental"" with ""In Action"" ...Since I have ""In Action"", I am not taking the $[money] odd plunge - but if someone else does, please let the rest of the Amazon community (the best virtual community in the world) know if I am right.I have rated ""In Action"" with 4 stars - not as good as 1998 ""The Take Off"" album (which is worth 5 stars for ""Come'n Get Me"" alone, although it has many other great tracks) or the more party-oriented 1999 ""Express""..."
2,Not terrible. Not Great.,"This light is not bright enough even for the tiny under the stairs closet I put it in. Also, the on/off mechanism is touchy---I often have to tap it 3 or more times to get it to stay on.On the plus side it was easy to mount, and the auto shut off feature is nice."
3,"Blue, rather than white light","This product is reasonable for the price. I needed to read at night with it after turning the bedroom light off. That is not possible, because the light is a dull blue. Why do most products from China appear cheaply made? That is the case with this item. It has been returned for a refund."
2,Cool Light.,"I'm using two in closets and will use the other for emergencies and tent light.Update for 2013.The LED's did not get a chance to last their 10,000 hours as the electronics quit but I Did buy it in 2007 but is was only used in a closet for occasional lighting. The other is still working."
2,The Garrity vs. the Hipe,"I bought this light and the Hipe 3 To provide more light for nightly bathroom trips than the standard nightlight and to save the energy from flipping on the overhead light. This one is considerably larger than the Hipe with no more light, maybe less. It's also heavier and promptly fell off the wall we attached it to. You can click it on. An advantage is that you can set the amount of time it stays on. The Hipe is more sensitive to movement turning it on, but it goes off very quickly, and there appears to be no way to set it to stay on longer."
2,Poor quality,"This is very cheaply constructed, feels like it will fall apart. After about 3 uses, batteries needed to be replaced. It works when it wants to, usually have to tap it (hard) several times before it will come on. It is bright enough for back corner of my clothes closet, but definitely CANNOT be used as additional lighting. This is strictly to help illuminate a pitch black area for safety/ easier navigation, it will not give you bright light."
3,Adequate,Illumination is OK. Unfortunately the timer often turns it off too soon. Handy in a cabinet or placed in a short time use circumstance.
5,"Great light, won't eat batteries","Bought one of these push lights at Lowes...broke the next darn day! Even after purchasing another round of uber-expensive batteries...I got nada! So I ordered this one HOPING it would be better. IT IS! Gives off major light and has a timer so even if my kid leaves the light on, it goes off after a minute, saving me from buying more batteries. (which were included BTW) Great product, love it."
4,It works,"Somewhat shoddy construction, you have to push it correctly to get it to light up. However, it works and is bright enough for closets or small spaces."
4,"Very bright, very useful, but not very warm light","This light is very bright for a battery powered tap light. The timer feature is a nice touch, and the ability to disable it is better still. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the light has stong bluish tint to it. I don't mind, but others in my house do."
2,Works great when it works,"Worked great for 2 months. Very bright but didn't last. After 2 months the lights got dim and eventually faded over a period of weeks...yes, regardless of batteries being replaced multiple times."
3,Unbelievably harsh light,"Bought this as a bedside light (have a small studio apartment and a murphy bed so no night table) for my boyfriend if/when he needs to get up at night. It is SO harsh, even when it's facing away from the bed and lighting up the room, we can't open our eyes after it's turned on because it's that harsh. Something about the color makes it very difficult to adjust to when your eyes are used to the dark. I suggest looking for something a little warmer-colored if you're going to be using it at night!Otherwise, works great, light is very powerful and can light up a small room enough to see where you're going. Timer is very easy to use - just turn the knob on the side to the desired amount of time, or turn it all the way to disable the timer. If they'd warm up the light just a tad..."
1,Ey to use but nearly useless,"Bright, but light doesn't carry or spread out. Not what we needed for the space by a washing machine. Shadowy."
4,noone really knows about this song.....,but its funny as hell and a classic .....makes me want to wreck shop
1,A rip Off,"This dosn't deserve one star. It looked homemade and it wasn't made very well. I thought it came with a cup but it didn't. It was a dismo brown vinyl, that didn't fit over any size cup I had. It looked like something that belong in an old barn let alone something you would want to put on your desk. To say the least I was not happy."
5,Starter bracelet,The start of my Italian charm bracelet collection. I am now addicted to italian charms. Love them!!
5,Good and Fast,"Good product, very well priced, was well packeged, and it shipped here to LA in amazing time, thank you !!"
4,Pretty interesting,"Great drinks, great sets ups and funny scenarios. The book is very descriptive and helpful. It gives good instructions and also gives options for substitute ingredients if you don't have everything you need. The ""what not to do"" hints are a great addition. Some drinks are a little outlandish, but it's overall pretty interesting. Definitely stands out from the rest of the drink/bartending books on my shelf."
4,entertaining drink book,"if you ever had a problem coming up with an excuse to drink, this funny book will help you out - plus it doubles as a coaster"
1,Until they bring the streetcars back,Sorry I spent the money on this one! The style of writing got extremely annoying after about two chapters. I only finished because 1) I had a few bucks invested in it; and 2) I'm from St. Paul and the places and events were of interest. With a subject as serious as this I feel the author could have handled the material in a much more adult manner; as it was I felt like I was reading a jr. high school diary. And not that well written a diary either. Sorry...
1,Sometimes a Critic,"I heard this book & author discussed on Garage Logic: Rave reviews. It's about St.Paul, so it must be interesting at least. Wrong!The book is trash and that's where I threw it.Don't waste your money or time on this book.Wish I could have given it zero stars."
1,Until they bring the streetcars back,This book is a very stupid book.NO ONE SHOULD EVER BUY THIS BOOK EVER. this book is very very very very very crappy.
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Stanley Gordon West's Until They Bring the Streetcars Back is like nothing I have ever read before. From start to finish it keeps you guessing and inching to read more. Many novels focus on one hardship or conflict, but this one focuses more in depth towards problems existing beyond what is actually occurring. A young, responsible adult in Calvin Gant must find a light at the end of the tunnel for the help of a friend, Gretchen Lutterman. With his personal life to compensate for, Cal sets all that aside for what seems like a neverending nightmare, but after his deliberate attempts and confidence he helps Gretchen through the good and bad.This book caught my attention and touched me like no other book has. There are so many lessons to learn from Cal and what is of real importance in life. If you have not read this book I recommend you do so because it will grab your heart and never let go."
4,Great Book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book by West. I could not put it down, I had to finish the book all in one night it was so good. It really reminds you of what you want to be and sets you back on course. One conversation with Gretchen and Cal ends up in jail because of her. I recommend this book to everyone it is a great story. I had to read it for english class and I never thought I would actually like a book for english class but I like this book."
5,Another Winner,"I found this book to be another fascinating read by Stanley Gordon West. I have now read all of his books, and enjoyed each one of them immensely. They are each quite different, but thoroughly enjoyable."
3,Loved and Hated It,"Until They Bring The Streetcars Back was a dark and depressing book. However, the message it has makes the book worth reading. If you are looking for a fairy-tale ending, do not read this book. The darkness and injustice involved in reading this book will make your stomach twist and turn. All-in-all, I liked reading it but I hated how dark and depressing it was."
3,"Not bad... but not 5-star, either","The story moves quickly, but the plot feels blocky, like parts couldn't be integrated more smoothly, and some aspects seemed only to be there for aesthetic purposes--like the blatant allegory that really wasn't necessary, and in fact detracted from the story.The characters, though, were well-written and strong, and the setting was wonderful."
4,A VERY GOOD DUAL DECK VCR,"This is a very good dual deck vcr.The only problem is, it does not copy copyrighted tapes.I was led to believe that it does before I purchased the vcr.Otherwise, this vcr works very well."
1,More about arabic music than dance,"The dancer seemed very knowledgeable,however, the video seemed to be more about learning about Arabic music and Arabic rhythms than about bellydancing techniques. It wasn't quite what I was looking for. But if you want to learn about Arabic music then this may be the video for you!"
5,Well worth it if you are really trying to expand your dance.,"As a student and dancer, we spend a lot of time watching videos, looking for a good teacher and practicing. There is a lot to learn and when you find a good teacher who can layer your lessons all into one source that is great! Ranya does such a good job reviewing the music and cultural history behind baladi. Her physical descriptions and willingness to put herself out there to explain things is refreshing. Her performances are yummy (that body!). The way the DVD is structured does allow you to become a student if you are willing to listen learn and review. I bought her videos and did them in parts. I listened to the first one and then studied the information she reviewed. It made it a lot easier to understand and appreciate the 2nd video which has the drills. Well worth the money for any dancer that truly wants to understand Raqs Baladi. Shimmies!"
4,Cranked Up!,"I usually pass on the jungle native venued films, but reading reviews some time ago on another board caused me to take a look. A repeat viewing confirms the first impression. This is one of the best for the interaction of these stars. Clark Gable, though sometimes obnoxious, especially by today's much altered gender assignments, had a quality that always provided interest. He seemed to go into overdrive when playing a hustler type. Myrna Loy's comedic roles held the most interest for me, very strong here. I like Walter Pidgeon differently, appreciating him in his active roles like this one and also for his gentlemanly portrayals. He is really gratifying here by giving Gable's character a genuine run for his money, on two fronts. Very durable and reliable stars working well together in this. And funny and wild and fast. They really cranked them out back then; and sometimes they really cranked them up!!! Do see."
2,"Sorry, this one was a major disappointment.","I guess this movie proves that you can have two terrific stars and still have a flop. There were so many things I found irritating about the story. First, Gable's character's attitude toward the heroine's flying abilities like a pat on the head and a smirk. Yes, I know it was a product of the times, but still it made me dislike his character. Not to mention the terrible racial slur in the end of lets fool this African tribe with our so called 'magic.' Despicable. Most times I can handle racial slurs of the time, but this was just too blatant and ridiculous. Gable usually can make any character likeable, but by the end of this film I was wishing Myrna would kick him to the curb."
3,Side Men Better Than the Star,"Matt plays a pretty good mandolin, but, his breaks pale in comparison to the masterful work of Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan and Bryan Sutton. The compositionsnoodle around a lot and lack structure. This doesn't mean this is a bad album; some of the breaks by Matt's sidemen are really outstanding."
1,"Lies, lies, lies","Don't get suckered into buying this book. I did, and it's not worth it. You'll be wasting your money on a bunch of offensive, racist bull. Ah, but Kola Boof is black, yes? You will say. Islamophobia runs rampant throught the book, as the author apparently has a historical axe to grind. When I bought this book it was the 2006 version, and there were a bunch of reviews about how ""wonderful"" and ""amazing"" her life has been. There is absolutely no proof to supplement any of her claims, if you don't believe me just go to wikipedia's areticle about Kola Boof and read what people are saying there. The version I got was also horribly proofread - the spelling was simply TERRIBLE."
1,Save Your Money,"This book is a total waste of money. The author obviously doesn't re-read her own words for consistency and truth. I felt it was an insult to my intelligence as a reader, writer and as a human being."
1,Too Fantastical...,"Ms. Boof's claims read more like FICTION than fact...a la James Frey, TOO unbelievable to be believable.A must read for anyone interesting in buying themselves a bridge, dining with the Easter Bunny and having Santa Claus play the lead in their annual psychiatric rendition of Truth or Dare.Otherwise, save your money and wait for your local library to get a copy, and hope your local librarian has better sense than to waste the budget...."
1,So monotOnous,"Given the overall reviews, thought it might be an interesting read, but Ms. Boof manages to repeat herself hundreds, if not thousands of times. Seriously, we get it...whites, biracials but mostly black men are not only bad but evil. Read the first couple of chapters if you must and save yourself the agony!"
2,Hard to believe,"I have almost completed this diary by Ms. Boof. However, I can already say that I find her life in so many parts unbelievable; it reads like a bad soap opera plot. In addition, the poor grammar and incorrect English usage distracted me more than I would have liked. If you want to read a story that is truly one that is difficult to believe, this is the one for you. A reader in Northern Virginia"
1,Good thing it was free,"Poorly written, poorly edited, extremely repetitive and not worth paying for. Glad it was free or I would have been annoyed at having paid even a dollar for this."
5,"My First Kola Book, But Not My Last","Kola has a rare gift for painting a picture of her words on nearly every page. I cried when she was hurt, laughed when she was happy, and felt her pain and her victory. She writes ultra hot erotic encounters, as well as devastatingly sad accounts of her rape and abuse. It's a wonder she escaped those experiences with such strength, determination, and courage. While I don't agree with all of Kola's opinions in the latter part of the novel, I applaud her fearlessness at saying exactly what is on her mind. Overall an excellent read."
5,Truth Telling,Kola Boof's autobiography is a powerful and riveting narrative that inscribes both the truth about her life and the truth about the culture and political climate in Sudan. She is a masterful storyteller with a command of imagery that is breathtaking. I could not put this work down. The reader will be impressed and moved by Ms. Boof's will and determination to survive. Her story should make you rethink any complaints you may have about your childhood and pause to be thankful. Read this book and thank the universe!
3,A weird little book,"This was definitly the weirdest book I have ever read. I never had heard of this author, but bought the book because of the glowing reviews......I just ""didn't get"" the book ??? This lady is angry and a little weird."
4,Sticky,"Be warned, the texture of this is much different than a standard lubricant like KY or Astroglide.It stays where you put it, and has a nice thick texture. However, it strings! When you put a dab on your hand to cover something, when you pull your hand away you will have strings of lubricant when you pour, and after spreading. It is a little odd and you need to move your hand around to break all the strings. The sticky texture can also lead to a little noise later.If you can ignore the tendency to form strings it is fine."
1,Probe Lub,"It arrived on time and in good condition; however, I was disappointed with this product. It dries out very quickly, and it tends to be very sticky as it dries and leaves a ""film"". Also, it is not that ""slick"". There are much better products on the market, and I will not buy this product again."
4,A SOLID SALUTE TO FORMER YANKEES,"IF YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THE YANKEES FOR 40 OR MORE YEARS, THIS IS A GREAT READ FOR YOU. IF YOUR FOLLOWING OF THE YANKEES IS LESS THAN THAT, THIS IS STILL A VERY GOOD READ. MANY WELL KNOWN AND NOT SO WELL KNOWN PLAYERS AND MANAGERS ARE FEATURED IN THIS BOOK. FROM THE MICK, THAD TILLOTSON, GEORGE FRAZIER, RALPH HOUK AND MANY MORE. THE MEN IN THIS BOOK DISCUSS THEIR CAREER IN BASEBALL AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING TODAY. THE AUTHOR BRIAN JENSEN CONCUCTED IN DEPTH INTERVIEWS AND HAS WRITTEN A MUST READ FOR YANKEE AND ALL NOSTALGIC BASEBALL FANS. I AM AN INDIAN'S FAN BUT IT BROUGHT MANY MANY MEMORIES."
2,Review of study guide,The study guide's context follows an outline strait from the textbook. The content was disappointing. The entire study guide only contained a series of questions and answers. The guide gave no additional information or clarification to the material in the textbook.This study guide is a waste of money.
5,Peaceful!,"What an incredible artist.....being from new hampshire, we can call Dana our own! And we're willing to share her with the world!If you just need some time away from the hub-bub of this crazy world....throw this cd in, make a cup of tea...and enjoy her music!"
5,Bravo!,"I felt like standing up and clapping with the audience after each piece. This CD is absolutely wonderful, in all aspects. The musicanship is impeccable and the production and sound quality couldn't be better.I picked it out to hear the Mendelssohn Piano Trio No. 2, and that piece is done so vibrantly and ecstatically that it's surely one of the best on record. Not to say that the other pieces aren't on an equally high level.I can't imagine any classical music fan, and especially chamber music fans, being disappointed with this CD."
3,A good first album,"This album was Dean Torrence's first solo album after Jan's accident. The album is hampered by Dean's ""bubble gum"" type music and simple lyrics. Also, Dean is not a strong singer on this album. However, it is a good first album effort.If you can get a copy, please contrast this album with Jan Berry's first post-accident album (a bootleg) ""Carnival of Sound"". (Dean only sings background on a couple of songs, at most). I was surprised how good ""Carnival of Sound"" is when compared to ""Save for a Rainy Day"". This album was mostly done by musicians and friends of Jan, almost completely without Dean. For the first time, Jan had limited direct personal input into an album (due to his accident). In this case, Jan did not (could not) sing on the album and did very little writting for the album. Mostly, he contributed to the album concept and direction, arrangement, and production."
4,We used to play in Joe's garage,"This is the first Jan & Dean album recorded after Jan Berry's horrific car crash. Previous Jan & Dean albums had been produced by Jan, so with Jan layed up in the hospital, Dean Torrence produced this album. He actually ended up making a minor masterpiece. But to backtrack a little, the album actually started when Dean heard a demo of the song ""Yellow Balloon"". Dean loved the song, and he decided to make it the next Jan & Dean single. Then he decided to record a whole album based around ""Yellow Balloon"", with all the songs having a ""rain"" theme. He even went so far as to include rain sound effects between all the songs. There were ten songs on the original album; five originals and five covers. The CD version features the complete original album in mono, plus 13 bonus tracks of stereo versions, alternate takes and backing tracks. Recommended for fans of the California sound."
5,Where do I begin?,"For J&D; fans, ""Save For A Rainy Day"" is the Holy Grail. As with ""Pop Symphony,"" I long hopelessly scoured used record stores for these releases. The best I could do was a pretty good copy of ""Command Performance,"" which I happily paid a fortune for.Whoever invented CD's is the Edison of our time. It has allowed treasures like ""Save For A Rainy Day"" to be rereleased in what is clearly a better format. The bonus tracks included on many of these rereleases are like a personal gift.""Save For A Rainy Day"" was as wonderful as I imagined. Sure, Dean is not the greatest lead vocalist in pop history, but you can literally hear the effort and passion on each track.There are some complaints about the quality of the sound, but it simply can't be helped. It was recorded in 2-track mono in Joe Osborne's garage, not 48-track stereo in the Capitol studios.Just friggin' buy it!"
3,cookwares,its ok not great bought because its yellow and my remodled kitchen is themed yellow.prefere rachael raye. but oh well.
4,mystical,This is a beautiful piece. The voices are pristine and the melodies elevate me above the realm of the profane. A must for those who seek to deepen their spirituality
5,Love my rice bowl,"I use this as my rice bowl. 1 to 2 cups of rice fit nicely in the bowl. I love the colors. I have used this for several months, including running it through the dishwasher after most uses. It has held up with no chipping or fading of colors.Update: A year and a half later, this bowl still holds up to daily use and runs through the dishwasher a few times per week. It is my favorite bowl - I used it at almost every meal!"
1,Charger killed my phone,"I bought this charger for my LG CU500. After less than 30 minutes of charging, it killed my phone. I tried resetting my phone, took the battery out and put it back in, but nothing helps. My phone is dead. There is no response to my email from the company, overall this stands as one my worst online shopping experiences"
1,Silly! Did not work!,"I bought this charger set for my old VX4500 phone, and neither worked at all ... Even though the product description lists my phone as one that these can charge. The wall charger would not physically plug into my phone, and the car charger fit but so loosely that it wouldn't stay connected. Furthermore, the car charger didn't cause my phone to display the ""now charging"" light. Because these chargers were so cheap, there was no point in returning them. In the end, I donated these and my old phone to a recycler and just got a new phone ... Refurbished and even new phones are incredibly cheap nowadays. Why struggle with hunting down old chargers? Too bad about this product ... Oh, well!"
5,Deep Inside of Third Eye Blind,"The single, ""Deep Inside of You,"" is the second hit from Third Eye Blind sophomore effort, ""Blue."" This song was written by lead singer Stephan Jenkins as he walked the charming streets of San Francisco one foggy night in the early '90s. This song is a personal favorite of mine, as it contains beautiful melodies and lyrics we can all relate to. The lyrics hold such strong magery, you can truly put yourself in the songwriter's shoes and experience the song from within. Backed with beautiful music, it's no wonder this band has proved that not all sophomore albums are slumps. THe acoustic version of ""Anything"" and live version of ""1000 Julys"" are added treats you're sure to enjoy. Check out this band live - next to purchasing the cd, it'll be the best money you'll spend on great pop music."
3,Should be better,"OK, it's the Vienna Philharmonic, and Sir Simon certainly has a resume of good to excellent recordings, but for me, this is like the Beethoven symphonies he recorded with the VPO: undistinguished. I just listened to Rattle's re-do with the Berlin Philharmonic, and it's way better, but still not on a level with Karajan, Bernstein, Levine or even Dohnanyi (the best by far of his Cleveland Mahler recordings). This is GREAT music, and that doesn't come out in this recording."
5,An excellent guide for Tennessee homeowners,"We moved to Tennessee from another state and were having trouble finding plants that would grow well here and we also needed new instructions for caring for the plants that we were used to, since they grew differently and bloomed at different times here.Thank goodness we found this book. It has made all the difference. The author obviously knows her plants, she writes from experience. And her advice is solid -- it works.The book lists a number of plants that were unfamiliar to me -- lorapetalum, arum, hardy begonia. And I was reluctant to try them. But after I had good success with the other advice in the book, I did plant them, and was glad I had. They are delightful.The section on starting seeds and the additional advice in the annuals chapter about growing from seed encouraged me to try starting some plants from seed and it has been fun.Also good are the sections on shade plants and how to cope withslugs and snails.I definitely recommend it."
5,"Excellent, small reference guide for this area","A copy of this was loaned to me by a professional landscaper in our area. It is an excellent resource for Tennessee and Kentucky gardeners who are not too sure what to plant. I was thrilled to see it was available at Amazon!It has an enormous variety of shrubs, trees, flowers, bulbs, etc., to plant in our area. All of the information on what they are, how to plant, when to plant, how to keep them healthy, trimming, companion plants ...The amount of information in this book is phenomenal for its size. It is a great reference tool as well as being fun to look through ... dreams of gardens to come!!"
3,"Good content, poor kindle presentation","First off, the content of this book is great. It's a great reference guide for anyone working with plants in TN. I'm rating this poorly based on the kindle presentation, which is in greyscale. I saw this book at Lowes and really liked all the full color pictures of every plant and wanted to get it on my iPad. However, when I purchased the kindle edition, all the pictures are in greyscale (I have a color kindle fire and an iPad). To me, half the value of this book is the color photos. My recommendation is to skip the kindle version in favor of the paperback."
2,Seeds and Seedlings,I was highly disappointed in this book. Thought there would be more key information to reference.If I could I would send it back.
5,Excellent,"I use this in my chicken coop and love it. It seems to be expensive, but I only use a small amount at a time to treat their water, so it lasts a long time. My chickens are incredibly healthy."
3,Resetting the processor solves the power off issue.,"I've had my DPR 2005 since they were brand new and it has been a great receiver. The only issue I've had was with the unit randomly shutting off after owning it a few years. I could power it back on but it would immediately shut off again. I found that by resetting the processor, per the owners manual - last page, it solves the issue. This has happened to me twice in the last year and the reset trick worked both times. I've seen numerous people complain about this problem and not being able to get it working again. I'm hoping the reset trick will help you like it helped me."
5,Sound is amazing,I just wanted to add my input on this receiver. It has never given me problems. The sound quality is amazing. I use it to watch movies and listen to music and I couldn't ask for a better sound. The only thing is that it doesn't give you hdmi inputs but if you're not looking for that and want 7.2 sound than look no further.
1,"Read my history with this product, judge for yourself","First brand-new DPR 2005 turns itself off right after I turned it on. Sent it back to dealer at my own cost.Second brand-new DPR 2005 has exactly same problem. This time I contacted HK and got the authorization to send it backThird DPR 2005 arrived and last exactly 3 months. This time they offered to exchange it for a refurbished AVR 635. I heard great things about the AVR 635, but let's wait and see"
1,All faith lost in HK,"I also suffered from the oft-reported ""switches off"" problem. My receiver made it about 60 days beyond the warranty period before this began. I've lost all faith in HK, a company from whom I have purchased stereo equipment for the past 15 years.Don't touch this receiver new, used or free."
3,wrong delivery,"I ordered an English copy and got a German one. The book was send to me from New Zealand at high transportcost. My complaint was handled in a satisfying way and I got an English copy second hand and the cost of the German version reemboursed. The only minus point was that the much higher transport costs of New Zealand were not reemboursed. So on the whole I lost 13 $.Kind regards, Jan-Peter Huges"
4,I will always hold on to this album,"There was another version of this album done with reworked beats, but I always liked this version best. I had a college radio show and ""Money"" or ""Love"" usually got callers right away asking about it. Sia's energy and delivery are funny and intense. If you're a fan of his performances, you'd probably enjoy this as well."
5,Too bad this is out of print...,"...cause now I can't buy it for people and impress them by saying ""I know this guy!"" Oh, well.... you may still be able to get this CD and his second one, ""Dope and Wack,"" at his website: www.beausia.com. You may be able to get his book there too. Good luck! :) -mjl from okc"
5,Mc poetry my mcnugget,"Yes Beau Sia is a poet, yes he is damn good at what he does and yes this is an attempt to bring poetry into the mainstream, and whats wrong with that. Everybody could use a little honest art now and then. That often means making it funny, god forbid. If you don't like it go read the Bitter Oleander and forget to take your medication. Long ago poetry was invented as a way to help remember important stories and cultural myths. To stick it in the heads of the masses using rhyme and meter. Poetry is supposed to appeal to a wide base, and it is sad that the small press is what it is restricted to now.I must say Beau going off live is much better than this cd for sure, but either way you must see in the stand up comedy stylings, the art."
2,"For spoken word cats, but almost no one else","If you're into spoken word/performance poetry, then you may glean things from this CD that are entertaining, (but probably not enough to make it worth buying, unless you're a hardcore poet-head...even then you may still be disappointed), but this work simply canNOT be recommended for people who thought they were buying a musical CD or the ""Slam"" movie soundtrack. This will bring no great number of people to poetry, and could even serve to push some away. Sorry, but for hardcore poet vets only, particularly fans of Beat generation work."
1,It's his voice,"I've heard many great poets give great monologues. What gives a good reading is the sound of the poet's voice. I'm afraid Sia has one of the worst voices I've heard. Thank God they digitized his voice because I'm sure it'd be twice as worst if they didn't! The lyrics aren't bad, but I didn't read anything that impressed me. The music isn't any good, it seems as if though they recycled left over stuff from other music and mixed it in this one. You can do without this CD and still be stimulated.Yeah, he kind of looks Korean doesn't he?"
2,Beau Sia can't write or perform!,"Beau Sia's writing is discusting! I was very disapointed in him. I heard so much about him and how he's such a great writer. So I bought his album, and I think it stinks! He's very vulgar, and when he speaks it sounds like he's about to run out of time. I can just imagine all his veins popping out while he frantically spits out all his words. I give this two stars because he is still a better writer than I am."
1,McPoetry,"This is strictly for 13 year old girls who like their ""poetry"" in little bite size MTV-deep-fried morsels. Sounds like someone gave any high school kid who just got into ""spoken word"" by way of Henry Rollins a tape recorder and a terrible producer and said, ""Hey, dude, make your opus magnum!"" PPPHHHHFFFFTTTTDDD!!!"
1,close up,getting the best out of yourths demand that the adult refrain from cutting them short. close up remphasises and I support that youngsters need guidance and thgey deserve it
3,Could be better designed.,"Please refer to my review of: Talking Clock with EZ Talk Button - Spanish, as the same problems applies for both devices.Rgds.B.B. Freedom - Taylor."
2,needs better instructions,"I thought I was getting a Wilton quality tool but it appears to be just another private labeled one made in China. Hard to get adjusted from directions but with the help of a skilled friend who has similar unit, I now get a smoother cut"
2,A little disappointed,Daughter sent a gift coupon for Christmas and added extra for the band saw.Found the table not square as the fence will loosen from one side to the other. Blade tracking not consistent. Furnished blade will want to wander to the right. I will task to correct or modify in order not to disappoint her. She thought she did so good.
5,Great book.,"Difficult SideRead Sedra/Smith book before trying this one. It is really hard to follow. It's hard to differentiate between small and large signal analysis, since author uses the same notation for both. Watch out!Good Side:Book is on CMOS analog ICs, so it's specific.Book is very thorough. Behzad Razavi explains the function of each resistor in a circuit. Book teaches on a high level. Author put in much effort."
3,It is OK. There could be better ones,"I have used this book in a graduate class. It is good and very rigorous. It has good amount of examples and plenty of end of chapter problems. It is a good treatment of the subject. However, it might be hard as introductory."
2,not a good starting point,This is not a good book to start with. The book by Gray and Meyer and Hurst and Lewis is anyday much much better than this book. This book does not care to explain the meaning of small-signal operation and analysis and even such basic important aspects such as biasing and more subtler aspects in later chaters in feedback theory etc etc. It is not at all a good starting point. The excersises are good. Still not at all comparable to analysis and design of analog integrated circuits by gray and meyer...
2,Student in despair,"After the warm review by my Analog IC Design professor, I expected this book to be MUCH better. The material is explained well, but as a textbook, the Razavi text leaves much to be desired. Chapter two has 28 problems at the end of the chapter. Most are proofs or symbolic manipulations to obtain plots that exist as functions of three or more parameters.As a student, I feel that working out several pages of algebra is somewhat tedious when more concise questions may be devised that grant equal understanding of the material.In short, the reading is easy, but the problems have this honor student ducking for cover."
3,The book is Foreign edition,I didn't know this priont is for Singapore and not allowed to sell in the USA except McGrow Hill's permission.It is agood book but I didn't realize it is a foreign rpint after I bought it.
5,excellent book on CMOS VLSI design and circuit analysis,"Not many book around discussing analouge circuit design using CMOS tech, and this book offers reader with a new and fresh prespective of circuit design, compared with so called 'bible' like Paul & Gray analog IC design book.Mostly dealing with basic building block and circuit analysis, and the so called circuit ""synthesis"" is quite comprehensive and clear to follow.Lots of problem to solve and good for mind excercises.Good stepstone for book like Analog VLSI: Signal and Information Processing by Mohammed Ismail, Terri FiezThis is the preview edition. Hope in the 'finalised' edition, the authour will include answers/ solutions to the problems."
2,Not for the beginner.,"I went to the same school as the author of this book, and so it was used for my introductory CMOS design class. The book has a lot of great material, but it was rather confusing to me as a beginner. Now that I'm a more seasoned designer, I can look back on this book as an excellent reference, but I STILL find the explanations somewhat confusing. It's clear that the author is a foremost expert on the subject, but he just has some trouble relaying the fundamentals to the novice designer."
5,Worthy of the Subject,"This New Jersey Public Television DVD catches the engaging spirit of the Lion. It does a great job of placing this ancestor of Thelonious Monk in his period with interviews of contemporaries as well as quotes from the great James P. Johnson (who Smith, tongue in cheek, called ""the brute"").After you've seen it, imerse yourself in the Lion's music. There is a lot available to enjoy. Next read his autobiography and listen to some more music."
4,Great Season,An awesome 2004 playoffs season for the Eagles. Was a little weak on the NFC championship game but still good.Other DVD's in Series.St. Louis Rams 03-04 Season(8-8)Carolina Panthers 03-04 Season(7-9)Indianapolis Colts 03-04 Season(12-4)Green Bay Packers 03-04 Season(10-6)Seattle Seahawks 03-04 Season(10-6)Kansas City Chiefs 03-04 Season(13-3)Baltimore Ravens 03-04 Season(10-6)Dallas Cowboys 03-04 Season(10-6)Denver Broncos 03-04 Season(10-6)Tennessee Titans 03-04 Season(12-4)
5,Great relaxing ambient/dance music from masters of trance,"What more can you say about Blank and Jones? They are awesome. Love trance music as well as ambient/dance, and am so happy I found this CD. Like another reviewer, I wish more trance and ambient/dance music would be released on SACD or DVD-A! Come on guys, I would really love to hear your music mixed to a 7.1 surround experience!!!"
2,IRRITATING,Game plays well enough but has major flaws - black castles through check and in some modes the computer crashes. It requires a minimum of nine menu selections just to begin playing the first game and seven to play the next game. Graphics are OK but lost a lot of games because black pieces are the same color as the table background and there is little discernable difference between a bishop and a pawn. Don't turn off the lights (a feature of the program) because the screen will be black and unless you can find the switch again you're in real trouble. Restarting displays the same black screen. In all fairness there are lots of various features and although it plays well enough it is incredibly irritating to click through nine menus every time it's used.
4,Cute Gift.,"I gave this book as a gift, along with a season lottery ticket. It made the perfect accompanyment, and made my lottery ticket gift seem less impersonal."
3,"Interesting, But...","This is a small book, both in size and in content. It provides useful information, but the same information is likely available through the lottery office. I did find that it provides some commonsense concerns and addresses them practically. Overall, I was just expecting more."
4,should say what to do after you win the lottery,"This book is very informative it gives a lot of advice from the pros and cons of choosing cash or annuity payments of the jackpot prize to how to tell family members plus how to keep your privacyIt also explains taxes and how they are figured out. Even though it does not have info on how to win (wrong book) but it does give you excellent advice on what to be prepared for once you do become a millionaire, which a lot of uniformed winners experience the hard way only to go on tv to say that winning was the worst thing to happen to them in reality it can be the ultimate blessing giving one new freedoms in their lives once they have proper information to do so. And this book is the one it only has 125 pages and is very thin.which is good for it gets right to the point and the contents help you pick the right answers on a fly."
4,"Lottery-Winner's Guide, When It Happens to You",This is very helpful to anyone who buys lottery tickets ever. How many of us really know what we would do if we really did win and this book demystifies the process of becoming a person of wealth virtually overnight and it's stunning implications. How NOT to get into trouble when you hit the jackpot is what you need to know.
2,Very disappointing.,"I wish I could have leafed through this book before buying it. It is not a representative sampling of 45RPM sleeve art; it looks like a very personal selection of covers, and if your tastes happen to be different (as mine are) there's very little to appreciate in this book.But worst of all, in my opinion, is that the older sleeves look like they were picked up in a junk store just the other day. Absolutely no restorative work was done on the pictures; they are faded, dirty, and worn, which is hardly representative of the way they should look. It just seems that nobody cared about doing a good job."
3,Very boring in the first half; then OK,The first DVD is really boring; not much teaching at all. The third disc is OK but I cannot recommend the set for the price.
3,Memories,"My family lived in the house described in this book for several years before the Townsends moved in. I was a very small child, what memories this book brings back! I am giving it a 3 because I don't think it the writing quality was great ( a little to ""cutsey"") , but it does a very good job of capturing the life and people in the Santa Ynez Valley in that era ( the 60's ). I was there, and the ""flavor"" of the area is in this book. A good piece of history, with some funny moments. Should be interesting for those interested in Regional and era related writing."
3,False Advertising,I always make sure to ensure quality when I make a purchase..I usually opt for 'leather' rather than synthetics as it usually lasts longer. This is advertised as 'leather and nylon' but I just received this bag and the tag says 'faux leather'! Not a happy camper.
5,better than a title could describe,Someone to Love is a very powerful novel written about a woman who feels alone and is desperate to feel loved. The author could not have written a more true to life story about so many women today. Hope and understanding fill the pages from beginning to end. When reading this book it is impossible not to be drawn into this world of imagination. I couldn't recomend a better place to escape from the ordinary of everyday life.
5,The most accurate watch I have ever had,"I bought this watch because:1. it uses light as a source of power;2. it can synchronize with the atomic clock in Colorado automatically using radio wave;3. it was on sale here for $63.5 shipped around 2005 X'mas. (I did have to pay ~$8 to have the watch band adjusted locally.)I am completely satisfied with this watch so far. It was so accurate that I can tell whether my PC's clock is off.It sync'ed with the atomic clock every night (I am in NJ), not a miss so far.It's a bit thick, but the build quality is well worth the money I paid for.Highly recommended (I recommended it to my brother already :-)."
4,Great Timepiece!,"This is a great timekeeping device. It's basically set and forget. You can count on always having the correct time and you never have to worry about batteries. The only complaint I have is with the wristband, which requires a special tool to remove/add links. I've had Pulsar and Citizen solar watches and this is the best performer so far; and the price puts those others to shame.This is an update after three years. The silvering on the end of the band, where the band meets the bezel has worn off completely, exposing gray plastic. They cut corners on a part that shows and cheapens the look. The watch still keep perfect time."
5,Casio Men's Waveceptor Atomic Solar Watch # WVA430SGA-9A1V,This watch operates excellent what else can be said! Every night it tunes in WWV and syncronizes! It stays fully charged with routine light exposure! Does everything as advertised.
4,Original is best,"I love Emma Shapplin. I first heard these songs on her cd Carmine Meo and honestly I like the version on that CD best. Probably as i'm not a big techno fan, if you're wanting a dance song it's great, if your wanting beauty buy Carmine Meo. In my humble opinion. :-)...PS I wish she'd tour here. I think she'd be a hit in Austin."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I am a huge fan of Emma Shapplin and was very excited when this CD was on my Amazon recommendation list. It is basically 1 song played over and over again with different back beats. This would be fine if the back beats were any good. There is only 1 version which is descent and this is already on Emma's ""Discovering Yourself"" CD. All the other versions are simply disco rehashes which don't even complement the song. Very upsetting!!!"
1,OPERA TRANCE,"HOOOORRIBLE! I'M A FAN OF EMMA SHAPPLIN, BUT WHAT WAS SHE THINKING WHEN SHE CONVINED HER BEAUTIFUL VOICE WITH LOUDER THAN HER TECHNO-GO-GO SOUND!I got this Cd as a present, too bad! It is so horrible that I couldn't stand listening to it anymore and I just took it off the player!Horrible!"
2,save some cash,"the store bought beats sound like something i have heard at every club ive been to, at least for 1 and 2, track 3 is the only one worth listening to on this cd, this girl has a great voice and im sure her solo stuff is good but with the junkyard beats this cd just isnt worth listening to"
5,You better get this one!,This Cd is so trendy. It has a pop feel to it but it also have awesome lyrics that will change your life if you really listen to them. They have a fresh sound that is very hip and happening. The Harmonies are amazing. Roger Breland is an awesome God centered man and has shown this in this group. Great Job Roger~
5,looks good at good price,looks good at good price. It's just what I need because constantly I swim and is resistant.An sport watch doesn't offer elegance of this and I shouldn't to buy another watch by the job.
1,Not matching with picture,"It is purple, not blue. Returned it next day. I did not even try the quality aspects of. no comments"
2,Quality problems.,"I have read other reviews about how great the quality is for the price. The appearance of the watch does look pretty good but the mechanics are not so great. The bezel of the first watch I received didn't rotate. I sent it back for a replacement. The bezel on the second watch I received worked but the second hand moved between the second marks like it was counting half seconds all the way around the dial. I also noticed that this happened on the first watch, but for some reason the second hand hit the second marks only half way around the dial and was off the other half. The watch looks great but I woudn't say it's a quality watch."
3,Build quality,"Ordered this watch from Amazon for a good price. The Invicta #9308 is more about the ""bling"" than it is the functionality. Polished and brushed stainless steel bracelet adds to that look, along with flashy blue housing. Nice and light to wear and looks like a knockoff of more expensive watches. The luminous hands and markings glow well in the dark. The build quality, however, seems poor. The bezel on top is difficult to rotate, and the second hand hits in between the marks almost the whole way round. The best things about it are a)when you buy the watch from Amazon, Invicta extends the warranty to something like 5 years b) the price c) the presentation is very good--the yellow box the watch comes in is like candy. I almost wanted to keep the watch so I could keep the box. In the end, though, I went for the Momentum M1 Orca, which has greater functionality while a bit more expensive. Overall, I'd say this is a good starter watch for someone in high school or maybe college."
1,Great looks belie poor quality,"I had my Invicta for a little over 16 months when the set screw came loose and simply fell out. Now, say, if I dynamited buildings for a living, engaged in warfare or any like occupation or avocation where the watch was exposed to concussive forces far beyond the norm, I could possibly rationalize this defect, like I rationalized its gaining the odd minute every few days. Long story to short, this is a low quality timepiece, however well-tarted-up. Buyer beware."
5,Rich music to listen again and again and...,"Wonderful voice, rich and deep, well in line with the music. I own all Patricia Kaas CDs and at least for two months all I play when driving to work is Patricia. Definitely not to get bored with this music."
5,My favorite dinner CD,"Great voice. Really too captivating to listen to while working, but it can even make pizza and beer romantic."
4,A wonderful treat,"Patricia Kaas has a deep, sultry voice whose soul and feeling transcend any language barrier. This album is a must-have for any francophile and a wonderful treat even for the non-French listener."
5,Superbly ethereal & intoxoicating,"A friend from Buena Park,California introduced me to Patricia's provocative style...blues, jazz, caberet/lounge...... pure rapture!!Love the English/French mix. Have 2 other CDs...Scene De Vie is okay, but feel Tour de Charme is superb!"
1,In the three top worst ever movies.,"If you buy this movie used for .01$ you are overpaying. It's a Cloverfield wannabe shot on a budget of about 50.00. The director should have gone to film school or at least taken the time to learn anything about sound tech, and it would really have helped them to hire a screenwriter that was out of the third grade, ( no offense to third graders intended). The other two top bad movies? They would be ""Blair Witch"" and ""Barry Lyndon"". But at least ""Barry Lyndon"" had decent costuming. Save your time and money on this one, even on netflix this would be a waste of money."
1,Puke,"At least I only paid seven dollars and got free shipping. Don't even imagine you can compare it to Blair Witch or Cloverfield! Those are good, this is not. Edit out the time when the screen is grey or messed up so bad you see nothing and it might, only might, be worth a view. Naw, not really. I implore you- take these one star ratings seriously- this movie is no good- do not waste your time. Do not waste your money."
1,The true Horror is that this movie was made!,"Just spent almost 2 hours watching this piece of Do-Do ,thank goodness I had the fore thought to DVR it .Too bad I didn't realize how my tolerance for BAD SCI-FI movies has hit rock bottom.It's almost as bad as Sharktopus ( don't even bother ).I noticed one reviewer said the action took place in Japan,poor guys brain was completly turned to mush,or he confused the map of Texas,Mexico and California for Japan.Plan 9 from Outer Space now has some serious competion for the worst movie ever!"
1,Crime against humanity,"The only entertainment you'll get is spotting things like American street signs and Pinkberries on the streets of ""Tokyo"". $22 for this visual vomit? They should pay people $22 to watch this. This is like the porn version of Cloverfield, except without any sex and lots of long, long, long monologues from awful actors.Blech."
1,Garbage,"Do not waste time nor money on this movie. Pretending to be the real thing, 2 girls visits Tokyo, suddenly finding them selves under attack by a giant squid or what - you actually never really see it. There is no story, camera held worse than Cloverfield. I paid for this movie, and now I shall have to pay the garbage man to get rid of it. Believe it - this is worth nothing in fact you should get paid for watching this movie, it realy is that bad - and please do not buy it just to get confirmation.Regards Ren√©"
1,stop making these movies,"Why does this company still exist??? Who rents this stuff and how do they get into the big chain stores??? As usual, utter garbage from Asylum. You've been warned."
3,Who are the monsters?,"The acting could have been better, but the plot line was good. I kept asking where the monsters were. About half way through the movie I realized the title is the question-- who are the monsters? If you are looking for science fiction, you may not like it. If you are looking for a social commentary you may find it thought provoking."
2,The Generic Version of Cloverfield!!!,"I rented this movie a year ago, and I didn't really like it. I wanted to see the monster a lot more, but it mostly had two sisters talking the whole time. I wasn't able to see how it ended because the DVD screwed up! I wouldn't recommend MONSTER!!!"
1,Amateurish - and I am NOT exagerating!,"Started to watch this movie - quickly realized that I was wasting my time and stopped watching it. Apart from being boring, images were bouncing (looked like camera was run by a child), it was grating to my nerves, and utterly uninteresting!My recommendations - I don't have any except to avoid this movie!"
5,The Gardens of Colonial Williamsburg,"The Gardens of Colonial Williamsburg is a most inspiring and beautiful book covering the four seasons in Colonial Williamsburg. This book covers not only the history of twenty gardens in the historic district, but who these eighteenth century garders were. The archaeological research provides a detailed look at each of the gardens, giving layout plans and detailed list of all the plants used. With the addition of beautiful color photography, this book will provide all gardeners with a source to re-create a eighteenth century garden."
2,Curvature of Structure is Impeding,"I tried for 6 months to use this backrest as support in my carseat. I am now using the carseat again.It fits nicely around and mostly braced up against the seat well. The support portion was velcro, and neatly arrangeable to wherever was most comfortable for my back. The material is soft and mostly comforting. Unfortunately the steep, round curve of the product pushes my shoulders together too much, and ends up introducing just as many issues as it prevents.Also, while the adjustable velcro function is nice, If you happen to apply it at the wrong angle, it can take some fidgeting to get it back in a comfortable position. To its credit, the backrest put me at the perfect distance to the pedals, this made my driving experience much better, however, it just doesn't work.I view this as a waste of my money and will be searching for a new solution. I normally don't miss on pricier products, and I am definitely disappointed in this."
3,Good Support,"I use this in my car when my back is giving me trouble. It's good for long term driving. However, if you are tall or already sit close to the steering wheel and acelerator, then it may be a problem. This support brings you closer to both. It's really bad for my husband, so we have to remove it out or we are right up on the steering wheel. This defeats the purpose. However, I still would recommend it."
3,Dissappointed in this product,Not as much support as I had hoped for. the material is hot in warm weather and cold in winter.
2,Better then nothing,"Bought it expecting it to support my lumbar area at work. It does, but just barely. Velcro cushion does not come out far enough. I would not buy it again"
2,Just not worth it.,"Let's face it - this is an expensive product. For the price, I was expecting outstanding results, especially with the lumbar support. However, to no avail, was I able to get this product to act comfortably on my drivers' seat. There is not much in the way over overall support, and it lacks a certain ""plushness"" that you would come to expect from such a product. Overall, I'm disappointed!"
5,Obus Forme,The back rest is wonderful. My Wife and I have had back surgery and previously had two of them that lasted over 20 years.
5,Obus Forme Backrest,Excellent product. Gives just the support I need for my lower back. Bought one for work and one for home and am happy that I did. Highly recommended.
2,OK but not great,Still have to purchase a better chair as did not provide support needed for my back
3,Not a cure,"I got this for a gift and it didn't work for her, so she said I should try it. And I do use it, I have it on my chair now, but it is not a cure for lower back problems. I find it nice and comfortable, and it provides some support, but my back still aches. I don't doubt those who have indicated it to be a solution to their back aches, but it didn't help me that much."
5,Very satisfied with this purchase.,This was also given as a Christmas gift to a good friend. She was completly satisfied with this lowback backrest.
5,we love marty!,Very satisfied with this order.It came quickly and was exactly what we wanted! Plus it was much better price compared to some other sites.
2,Would Not Suggest,"I studied very hard for well over a month through this book and took the test today. Now I don't know my score yet or anything, but my general impression is that this book is not at all representative of the GRE Psyc exam. The Kaplan book only covered less than 50% of what was on the actual exam. I had to rely mostly on logic, reasoning, and what I had picked up from classes and my own studies to do a lot of the test. The Kaplan book did not at all cover I/O psychology or many famous experiments or facts that were on the test.Also, the Psyc GRE was much more application based than the book portrayed. There are no ""Definition given - What is this called?"" questions. I blew through the practice tests in just over an hour for the most part and did well, but took over 2 hours today and did not have time to check my test again. I haven't looked at the other books out, but I would highly suggest looking into other books or at least supplementing your study with something else."
1,I SCORED LOWER USING THIS BOOK VS. NOT STUDYING AT ALL,"Words cannot describe how useless this book was to me and my frustrations for using it to study for 50+ hours only to see that so much of what i studied, wasn't on the test and what wasn't in this book was. By using this book, i totally blew my attempt to increase my score on a second round of testing.Also, typos abound in every chapter (e.g. ""by"" supposed to be ""be,"" ""see"" meaning ""is,"" etc.) This book felt like 8 different authors crudely compiled chapters according to what they felt like discussing.Shoddy research. Poorly edited. Questionable content. This book is absolute marketing BS."
5,An Incredible Exposition of Witchcraft,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have been a Christian for over half my life, and I realized, through this book, that I had a lot of the biblically defined traits of witchcraft. Joyner discusses witchcraft in the biblical sense of manipulation and rebellion. He mentions very little about our culture's stereotypical definition of witchcraft. This book definitely brings a whole new level of one's understanding of witchcraft. I never really knew I dealt with witchcraft in my life until I read this book. I highly recommend it - especially if you are a ""manipulative"" person. Blessings!"
2,Misleading and Misunderstood.,"First, I must say that I did not finish reading this book, I didn't even get past the first chapter. My friend who is a Christian got ahold of this book, she read it then came storming up to me and in a very rude tone said ""I think you should read this!"" I began reading it but I found it extremely offensive, I am a Wiccan practitioner and Our one law says ""And it harm none, Do what thou wilt"" In other words it's against the ""law"" to harm somebody.The worst you can ever do, unless you believe in harming yourself, is a justice spell. Because of this books misleading content and its misunderstood perspective of Witches my friend now believes that I am going to attack her, that there are evil witches around every corner and that they all wish to eat her alive and such. I dissagree with this book to the furthest extent any Witch or regular person could possibly dissagree with anything. This book is nothing but fire kindling to my way of thinking, for a fire to burn Witches."
1,Begruzzled,"I am a 12-year-old Wiccan practitioner, and am hurt by the continuation of myth and legend throughout the Christian society today. I think those of us who are considering this book might consider this: Perhaps you are working too hard on digging up dirt on us, instead of finding the understanding of the other culture that Wiccans have held for so many centuries."
1,talk about stereotyping and miseducating!,"I haven't read this book. i don't want to. but as a practicing wicca, i find it very disturbing that someone could write a book about wiccans, and claim we attack people...if this person had done their research, they would have known that wiccans do not do magick to hurt people..we believe in the law of return, so attacking people wouldn't be wise...i'm very hurt that people still think wiccans are evil..."
5,I'm Wiccan,"I agree with Fogmoon- you can believe what you wish, but the truth about witches is we are not bad people. If you couldn't see the pentagram on my neck, you'd never guess I wasn't ""one of you."" Please don't judge people you don't know."
1,BOOK OF HATRED AND INTOLERANCE!!!!,This book is nothing but a tool for those with hatred and intolerance in their hearts.Don't waste your money or your time with this book. It doesn't rate the one star that I had no choice but to give.The truth of Wicca/Witchcraft is love. Why would you want to overcome love?Blessed Be!
1,excuse me,"first of all mr.joyner you have no idea what are talking about do you, the bible says bad things about witches to scare people into being chirstian, the bible was written by man, not a god okay, second of all you better not use christmas trees or easter eggs anymore because those were the pagan's first. we don't harm people, christians thought it was ok to torture people, you are big hypocrite on a big power trip, but guess what soon you will fall too."
1,Gross Misinformation,"Let's see. The spirit of Witchcraft is to create benefit for self and others. It is to live in peace and harmony with one another and nature. It is family centered, life-oriented; it honors the Divine and our ancestors. Yep, I can see how some members of the author's cult might want to overcome all those awful things. Shame on the author and shame on those who support such hateful misinformation."
1,what an awful person,"us wiccans r not out there writing books on anti christianity and/or anti any other religion! wicca is about good , peace , harmony and kindness.#1 wiccan rule is to harm none!!!!!!!!!i give one star only because they would not allow me to give none you deserve no stars."
2,Great Disappointment,"I was amazed when I received the book. So many out of focus photographs. many of the photos were so bad that one would not be able to identify the plant unless you knew it. Why would a publishing company allow such poor quality to slip through their quality control department. Did Mr Howells not reveiw this book prior to final production.The photographic quality certainly for me, had a very negative impact on quite good informative documentation.Not a worthwhile buy as far as I am concerned."
3,GUESS I AM IN MINORITY ON THIS ONE...,"dont get me wrong,this is a solid release with excellent songwriting and musicianship - i just feel that it isnt quite heavy enough (for my tastes).i prefer the earlier Obsessed releases,and Spirit Caravan.dont know if this was due to being on a major label (columbia),but it just doesnt have the crunch that i need...."
5,A Classic,"I have just gone back and re-read this book for the second time. I was very aware of the beginnings of the HIV/AIDS crisis around the time they began calling it the Gay disease when the first newspaper articles were written. I am a straight public health nurse beginning to work on teen suicide at that time but it was clear from the beginning that this disease was terrible and that politicians were cowardly in facing this crisis from the very beginning. I keep this book on my treasured book shelf so I will never forget how bad things can get in this country. Lately, though, you don't need a book to remind you!"
4,"A must read for all people in the US, a wake up call","I thought Randy Shilts' account of the harrowing, persistent way AIDS wove its way into the US was amazing. Albeit a bit technical, the book held me spellbound and made me think twice about what is fact and what is fiction behind the closed doors of our government. The way the disease was treated cost many lives and a great embarassment to our country and Shilts portrays this saga in an exquisite way."
5,And the Band Played On,"Riveting reading. Even though we all know how this story ended, the way the book is written is exciting and suspenseful. Great writing."
3,Had to put it down.,"I am a 42--year-old gay male who has been out for twenty-three years. I just got around to reading this book this past summer. I'd read a sample of it online and it caught my eye. I really wanted to like because I know what an important work it is. Unfortunately I had to put it down after about two hundred pages. I don't know why exactly--Mr. Shilts certainly could write. I don't know, I just lost interest in it. I stopped forcing myself to finish books because they were ""important"" or ""classic"" a long time ago."
5,An astounding work of journalism,"I couldn't put it down. Not only did it document, day by day, the spread of the AIDS epidemic, it also documented the terrible blindness that allowed it to go on. I wept openly throughout the book. Touching, horrifying, and the definitive work on the AIDS epidemic. Easy to read, explaining in layman's terms the complex scientific terminology favored by the scientist characters. This is real, and that, ultimately, gives this book its power to move people. It will haunt you for days."
2,Don't take it all at face value,"Epidemiological narratives are fascinating, but loaded with judgments.In this book, Shilts shows off a lot of research plus storytelling skills. It's trying to be quite comprehensive, but there's a lot more to say about the subject.I recommend reading Paula Treichler's ""How to Have Theory in an Epidemic: Cultural Chronicles of AIDS (Series Q)""Paul Farmer's writings on HIV and blame are definitely worth reading (I don't believe Farmer ever writes about the book or movie of ""And the Band..."" but he's a great writer).AIDS and Accusation: Haiti and the Geography of BlameAnd I believe Simon Watney's ""Practices of Freedom: Selected Writings on HIV/AIDS (Series Q)"", a collection of essays, responds directly to Randy Shilts' book and criticizes it for the weight (and blame) placed on Shilts' ""Patient Zero"" character. These are all good perspectives to add if you're interested in policy, theory or social meaning around HIV/AIDS."
2,Seller had poor attitude product OK,As picture with description was not correct I called seller and he said description correct but had no idea if picture was right or wrong. Picture showed tapered shank not straight. To me this seemed odd as seller sure had to be responsible for the picture in ad. Product was shipped promptly and was as described.
2,My Mistake,"I made a hasty decision to buy this book based on the title and a friend's recommendation, because I was looking for ""help for the helper."" Unfortunately, it turns out to be heavy on the psychophysiology of trauma and attachment--which I'm already familiar with--and light on the help. If you're looking for a readable review of the science, you'll enjoy this book. If you're looking for practical solutions, I suggest you look elsewhere. What there is seems obvious and not particularly new."
2,Disappointed,"I was very anxious to get this software. I had been doing alot of shopping for wedding software. I choice the Printing Press Software for several reasons - their advertising and the thought that I can use my advanced computer skills to develop a professional stylish wedding invite. The software does not contain the fonts, the images, and the professional design as I was led to believe. I am very disappointed with this software and feel that Microsoft Publisher offers the same even more style of making cards/invitations. The invite design format in this software is poor - the fonts would be excellant for a baby shower or an infant or young childs birthday...the images are limited. Overall, the software was a waste of money"
3,Having problems with TECH support!!!!!!,"I have the Printing Press Platinum, Fonts & Graphics 2, and the Scrapbooking programs.I am having ALOT of problems finding some of hte features that are decribed and shown on the ""project"" page on the website.YOu can't talk to a ""real"" person...only able to send in questions via email......I REALLY needed someone to walk me thru!I would recommend the Fonts & Graphics Software...they are great!"
2,Nothing special,"If you are looking for a printing program for kids' invitations, this is fine. However, if you want something that looks professional, you quickly run up against problems with Printing Press Platinum. The borders are very limited. It is not obvious how to print the invitations on non-standard sized paper.In the end, I made my invitations in Photoshop and laid out the envelopes in Word with a mail merge for the addresses. I didn't use any of the work I had devoted to PrintingPress Platinum."
1,Poor customer support,"This software has many problems, to many to list. The most difficult part is the lack of direct customer support, only through email, and the company is very slow to respond. The fonts and graphics are very childlike and do not look as professional as I would have liked. There are better products out there."
1,"Uneven, Academic, and Often Inaccurate","This seems to be a digestion of some articles on risk management without the practical experience to make it useful for practicing risk managers.Forget that much of the theory is dated, the notion of how risk managment works is incorrect. This isn't a good resource. Try the GARP website for better resources."
2,MIldly entertaining but in the end--> subpar,"1. First of all, I'm usually inclined to like the principals in this movie. And... the movie is mildly entertaining. But... in the end, the entire premise of the movie is so fanciful that it comes in the way of enjoying the movie.2. Bottomline: If you must see this movie-> definitely only a rental type of DVD"
2,Where's the information about the music by Shane August?,I've been searching for the music from this movie and have been unable to find a soundtrack or any other music by the artist Shane August.Any ideas?
3,Croaked it out,"A Murder of Crows--I had never heard of this movie before renting it, and I had no idea why. I know now though. Sure, it's a good cast on paper. But, having arguably the worst performance of a bright career by Gooding, and just bad casting overall, it really took its toll on an interesting and thought provoking plot.To some, this film was predictable. But to me, it was total opposite. I don't know, maybe I'm just brain dead, but there were some major zigs and zags.The movie did drag somewhat during the investigation scenes, but overall, the pacing and directing were quite good. The last 20 or 30 minutes though were definitely worth sticking around to see. Maybe taken half heartedly by some of the actors, but it didn't ""murder"" the movie. 3 Stars"
5,A Great Mystery!,"One of my favorite unknowns! Before mystery movies became a dime a dozen, there was ""A Murder of Crows""! Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Berenger, how could you not watch this movie. I own it and have let many friends borrow it, not one bad review yet! Watch this great movie!!"
3,Lots of Promise........But,"I just finished watching the video on a dark and chilly August night in Arctic Alaska. The plot had a lot of promise, with its numerous twists....and the New Orleans and Key West locales were great......especially the New Orleans Garden District.I've admired Cuba Gooding for Boys in the Hood, but here he doesn't seem like a person being hunted by the law. He is too laid back and seems to be laughing at his own character.The other characters are not really developed and I couln't always see Berringer and Gooding too clearly because they were always smoking. I really wish it had been better. Gooding has lots of promise......but we may have to wait for his next couple of efforts. Earl Finkler"
5,Excellent Thriller,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Cuba Gooding, Jr. was outstanding in the lead role, and the plot was original enough to take and keep my interest. I would recommend this movie highly to anyone who likes simply enjoyable films. Two thumbs up!"
5,The BEST movie ever made,"Although my family is of Cuban origin I was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in England. Many people will know this small town as the birthplace of William Shakespeare, the greatest playwright in the world, ever. I also believed this, until I saw this movie, sorry Shakespeare, your time is up, give up your throne. The writer of this movie has got it `goin' on!'. This movie has more twists than a 'Curly Wurly'(Which FYI is a particularly twisty English chocolate bar), has some of the best acting I have ever seen on screen and the directing is flawless. This movie never came to the cinemas in England and I am currently petitioning the local multiplex to show the movie, even just for one showing, so I and countless others can marvel in its beauty."
1,I'd have given it no stars if it were only possible,"Please, please, PLEASE, do not see this movie (much less actually BUY it)!! It is without a doubt the WORST movie that I have ever seen. I honestly don't understand how people can possibly have liked it. The acting is all TERRIBLE - especially Cuba Gooding Jr.'s (what happened to him?). The plot is predictable and unexciting - the chase scenes are ridiculous attempts at suspense and, to put it lightly, the characters are outrageously unrealistic (picture cardboard cutouts with no real emotions). I'm just glad I saw this on Showtime and was spared the injustice of having to pay to see it. Please, if you value good entertainment, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! EVER!"
1,A MURDER OF CROWN,"TERRIABLE MOVIE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. SHALLOW PLOT AND WORSE ACTING TOM BARRANGER ONLY SAVING GRACE"
1,Amazon wouldn't let me give it no stars,"Whatever potential this film had went out the window when it flunked the smell test for realism.Generally, I'm a fan of colorblind casting, but this story was not written for a Black actor.A fugitive Black man in a small, predominantly white town is able to move around undetected? During the day?After that, I couldn't take anything in this movie seriously.I tried to suspend belief and go with it. Couldn't do it."
4,Deceptive? Trap,Lawson Russell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) lawyer and aspiring writer is critiquing book for an aged man who dies. There he comes in position of a manuscript for a novel about several lawyers being murdered. He published it as his own. His novel is a great success.There is only one catch; these were real deaths and only the writer of the novel could have known the details. So the writer must be the murderer.To further complicate things there is no record of the dead novelist.We have seen this primes several times but very few are this well acted.The Third Miracle ~ Ed Harris
3,A Murder of Crows DVD (used),"The DVD box was used and written on with marker, and the DVD disc was too, but the DVD played well. I paid less than $5.00 for the DVD so it was okay. I knew this was a used item when I bought it."
1,"Sorry, I thought it was very weak.","Maybe it was really great when it came out, because it doesn't stand the test of time as far as I'm concerned. While the plot has merit, the acting was sub par, and it was obvious from his first encounter w/the old man what was going on. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it, so won't elaborate. It's a so-so movie, and while some compare it to the Fugitive, I have to say not at all. Not even close to the caliber of that film. However having said all that, I will also say: Criticism is easy, art is hard."
2,"Predictable Plot, Bad Acting",I could not recommend this movie. I now understand why I have never heard of this movie. Cuba Gooding was sub-par and the plot was so transparent it was ridiculous.
5,Best of Class,"Hi MotoGP fans. I am the Director of Sales for Standing Room Only, which released this DVD.First. thank you for your interest in the 2006 Review. It was one of the most exciting years in some time.Please allow me to address a misapprehension on the part of one Amazon reviewer; that this title might have been better if developed and produced by Dorna, the rights holder. In fact, it was produced in its entirety by Dorna; Standing Room Only distributes the finished product without any modification, straight from the source.Customer comments are always important to us, and we communicate them promptly to the actual producer. Needless to say, we want to put out the best product possible. In this case we have no authority to alter the program in any way, should it be appropriate.That said, I think you will all find this to be highly exciting and enthralling viewing, with a close contest between Rossi and Hayden, and a large number of extra scenes and interviews. Thanks again!"
4,Not enough racing,"I think the video quality was good, so I don't know what the folks with VHS like versions were watching.As to the racing, I appreciate that it's hard to get a whole season on one DVD, but there was no continuity in any of the races.That said, I enjoyed this and don't regret buying it. Worth the money, but not as good as a Duke TT review, which are now twin DVDs."
4,Tastes Tart,"Good product, easy to take and easy on the digestive system with the other minerals as a buffer. I like the powder because it's pure vitamins and minerals, there aren't any ""other ingredients"", which also makes it hypoallergenic. Also, it's easy to sneak extra vitamin c into my kid's juice or food. It does taste pretty tart though, if you use more that 1/4 tsp in a cup of juice, it is very noticeable because of the taste.Vitamin C 1000mgCalcium 34mgMagnesium 32mgZinc 3mgManganese 1mgPotassium 86mg"
4,Depends on the circumstances...,"The thing is that I already possess the CD Carmina Meo. The songs on the CD Discovering Yourself are brilliant, as they have been modernized and are performed in an excellent manner, but if you already have the Previous version of the songs, it is kind of redundant to listen to the same stuff. I had expectations for the newer performance. But overall, Emma Shapplin is an awsome voice."
1,Not worth the money,"Emma Shapplin no doubt has a beautiful voice, but here's the ""but"". Her stab at combining pop and opera just doesn't cut it. I don't know if it's because her music selections were poor, I am no expert, I just am a HUGE fan of the pop/operatic genre. Her voice and the songs didn't really come together with that powerful dynamic combo that sends chills down the spine. I suggest Sarah Brightman who has pretty much domniated this genre, and also a less well known artist that I love named Laura Turner. I am always searching for new or obscure artists that perform in this category, and when I did discover Emma, I was disappointed. She was anticlimatic from what I was already listenning to. Try these artists instead and don't waste your money on Shapplin."
4,Great recent effort by a band that constantly suprises,"I am a fan of Give Out but Don't Give Up, so I enjoyed this album. Primal Scream is one of the most interesting bands around today. From their trippy earlier albums to their turn at Industrial/ Dance, they are constantly open to creating new sounds, instead of recreating their ""hits"" as so many other bands do nowadays. While this album is nothing radically new, I did enjoy it much more than say, XTRMNTR or Evil Heat. The first track ""Country Girl"" seems to have gotten the most airplay, but think that my favorite track is ""Sometimes I Feel So Lonely,"" a slower, more soulful track. This album is very ""country rock,"" but it's also very accessible to both new Primal Scream listeners and long-term fans. Enjoy!"
3,New direction - same swagger,RCB is not Primal Scream at their finest - but it still has some fine tunes on it.It is a complete change in direction and is akin to a fusion of folk and C&W; (think the humour of Cracker and strut of the Stones)If you love the sonic of XTRMTR you'll probably hate this - If you ever thought BG would make a reasonable Jagger you might just find this enjoyable.Trial listen first!
2,mmmbop....,"I was very dissapointed by this album. After the mediocre ""Evil Heat"" I was glad to hear that the Scream had made a total change in direction with their new album. But this album turned out to be even less inspiring than ""Evil Heat"". Some people have compared this one to ""Give out but don't..."" but I think it sounds more like ""Evil Heat"" without the electronics and drum-machines.There were no surprises or great musical moments on this album, just ordinary straight-foreward rock. Sure, songs like ""country girl"" and ""99th floor"" were pretty catchy, but nothing special. Not what you'd have expected after a four year long wait. This music could have as easily been composed by ""the Hives"" or some other ""alternative"" rock band.Also the lyrics and vocals were sometimes very cliche. A couple of instrumental jams would not have hurt this album."
1,10 days was not enough...,"One of my favorite bands produced one of my least favorite records of all time, this is not the Scream you've grown to love, the songs are poorly written and executed even worse, the guest appearances don't help at all [except Warren Ellis] this is such a poor attempt, it is an embarrassment however the b-sides to Counrty Girl contain the elemants that were promised to be within this record, a few decent tunes on this disc but nothing mind blowing whatsoever, save your money... unless you wanna hear they're attempt at being Jet mixed with the Waterboys(?) [hideous yes, but I think that was the plan] hopefully they will spend more than 10 days in the studio next time just being themselves, maybe even write some real tunes... I really hope anyways cuz I believe they can do much better."
4,"Great CD, Combining the Best Elelemts of the Group's Past Work","With tracks that range from country-esque to stompin' crankers, this CD is well worth the money. While the music is diverse, almost every track stands on its own.A huge fan of ""Sreamadelica"" back in the day, I nearly gave up on the band after the ""Vanishing Point"" CD, and I viewed ""EXTRMNTR"" as a very uneven work (flashes of brilliance intermixed with headache-inducing nonsense). But if you liked ""Give Out But Don't Give Up"" (I love that CD), then you should be happy with this one. Again, very diverse stuff, but rock solid all aound."
4,good album from a schizophrenic band,"While certainly not their best album (Screamadelica, Vanishing Point and XTRMNTR, depending on your point of view) it is a pretty good rock n roll album and much better than Give Out But Don't Give Up. This is basically their 2nd attempt at the southern boogie sound of the 70's and for fans of their dark dub/electronica it will be frustrating. The best songs on it are Country Girl and Dolls, which ROCKS regardless of your opinion of their direction on this record."
1,Don't Bother!,"My Mom used to tell me ""If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all."" But then Mom never saw these awful flicks, and I'm sure she would understand if I just give you a very brief warning.A few words jump immediately to mind when trying to think of ways to describe the movies in this set. Mom WOULDN'T understand though, if I were to use those words here in a public forum, so let me use these instead...Vapid... Worthless... Boring... Mindless... 80s girl bands at yuppie parties... UGH! The acting is horrible, and the stories could have been written by 5th graders.I know it's only six and a half bucks, but please, make a contribution to your favorite charity, or go buy a couple packs of cigarettes and start smoking, or do anyting other than wasting your money on this box of vapid, worthless, boring, mindless tripe!You have been warned!"
1,2 songs?,I could only play 2 songs on this cd. There were also 2 videos of them playing these 2 songs. Where are the tracks that I paid for?
3,comes up a little short,"on the outset let me say that reid genauer is perhaps one of the greatest songwriters i have ever heard. being an avid fan of strangefolk while reid was in the band and also the amazing percy hill, which features the amazing nate wilson and jon lecesse (who are also featured on this album), i was quick to pick up the new offering from reid. it features a few tunes from the old strangefolk catalogue as well as a few new ones. being a huge strangefolk fan it was a little tough to swallow the versions of some of my favorite songs but reid and the new band do them justice. the best is probably ""songs we sing"" which features some great soulful back up singing. the album as a whole feels a little over produced and seems to lack that gritty edge that strangefolk had or that reid and the assembly of dust have in their live performances. the album is defintely worth a listen but it my mind it comes up short...probably because of my own high expectations of reid genauer."
4,Exhausting,"Although a very difficult read,this was worth it.An emotional look at friendship and Gay relationships and culture in Britain during the AIDS years.The European focus would be a little strange for American readers because of the national healthcare system which is a major part of the story,but doesn't exist in The United States.The two main characters are brothers so much of the book is about family and the various definitions of family including both supportive and dysfunctional types.There were also bits of humor in this novel.Grammar references were especially funny.Golding's earlier novel called THE ABOMINATION was equally powerful."
2,decent grinder,"This is a decent grinder but nothing special. It comes with two standard cheap wheels. The guards are the usual fare. Wilton sources and rebrands Chinese grinders. It's probably the same stuff as Sears or maybe HF on a good day.I have 3 grinders - this one, a JET and a Baldor. The JET is the best value of the three - also Chinese and made by the same parent company as Wilton - but it runs better and is the one I tend to use the most."
5,Best tool in our garden shed.,I've had one of these Soil Scoops for about a dozen years now. Someone gave it to me as a gift. After all of these years and a whole bunch of landscaping and gardening - it's still the most sought after tool when many of us are out gardening. Ours has a wooden handle. I'm looking to add a few more (to avoid the waiting for it!). I'll try the silicon handle. Excellent - can't say enough great things about this product. I'm proud that it's made in the USA!
2,All In One Not So Great in the Long Run,"I bought this DVD/CD mega system at an electronics superstore less than a year ago. For the first several months it was AWESOME. I liked it because it did everything, and it was all wrapped up in one system. However, less than two months after I bought it, the store stopped carrying it, and wouldn't tell me why. Not surprising because about four months later, it started giving me problems. Average DVD's, which would be read just fine on any other player I could find, were said to be unreadable. I get this obnoxious message telling me ""this type of disc cannot be played."" I found that if I opened and closed the drive enough times, it would finally read and show the movie. Now, less than a year later, I have to buy another system if I want something reliable. Never again will I fall for something that sells itself as ""all in one"" because if one part goes wrong, you lose the whole system."
1,Pretty Bad,"On the plus side, the children like the songs sung by kids, which is why I bought, but this children singing is not the best.It's a hodge podge of voices and styles. I like the songs that have a gospel feel; however, all the different voices all over the place, and the ad libbed words, and the arrangement, and the tempo, and just everything is a big disappointment.It's just more of the crappy music one hears all over the place at Christmas time in the stores, which makes one weary of it all.Nothing beautiful here, or even good for your children's musical ear.They really spoil the 12 days of xmas. There are two silly adult voices, and two small unintelligible children whose singing lacks any musical quality.Forget this one."
3,This album has all the old favorites.,"This album not only has many of the old favorites we all love around the holidays, but some new ones that I grew to love just as much. Although the sound quality is not the best, the catalogue of hits makes up for it. My personal favorite is Up On the Housetop, which is done very well on this album. This is one of my all-time favorite christmas collections and despite the not so great quality I would recomend it to anyone!"
1,TERRIBLE,I downloaded these songs and the song titles did not even match the songs. The childrens songs were cute but the adult voices which joined in ruined the few decent songs on the album. Definately not an album you would listen to more than once and some songs you will skip over within the first verse!
5,A GREAT Children's CD...,And very pleasant for parents to also listen to. I found myself listening to it even without my son...
1,Cheesy.,"A big disappointment. I can only reiterate the other negative review. The song ""Mary Did You Know"" I would not want to hear more than once in my lifetime. Distasteful.--though, once again, the kids like it. I tell them I don't and we can't hear it. I find it unbearable."
4,"An old friend, but I have trouble reading it after cataract surgery",I've owned the Compact OED before: it's the great source-book of our recorded language. But I was near-sighted and could read the text even without the magnifying glass. But with 20/20 eyesight I have difficulty making the print out even with 4X magnifier glasses and the magnifying glass together! I'm checking what I can do with my eye doctor.
3,today,clasp on the watch band is too short-must mack sure I don't catch it something as it then falls off ny wrist.
4,Unique Book,This book somehow manages to put together some of my favorite subjects. It includes chapters on Gnosticism and spirituality and ancient earth history. The author is knowledgeable on these subjects and weaves them in well with the core subject of dolphins and other cetaceans. I will highly recommend this book to people with similar interests.
1,Total Nonsense,"I adore dolphins and waited for this book with great anticipation. What a disappointment. While the author makes the valid points that dolphins are intelligent, amazing animals worthy of respect and protection, he goes wayyyy over the line in anointing them with almost godlike abilities. His sources are questionable as he embraces the studies of controversial ""scientist"" John Lilly -- a man who once gave LSD to dolphins; had a female biologist live in a water apartment with a male dolphin (hide the paragraphs on sexual activity from your children); and thought it okay to drill holes in animal skulls to stimulate different centers of their brains. Oh -- but in other chapters the author finds the Navy's dolphin program sinister. Give me a break.The author clearly considers himself a champion of dolphins. Mostly, I found him and his work bordering on delusional."
1,Bad book condition,The book arrived in a very bad condition. The cover is nearly riped off from the pages.
3,Too many graphics,"With too many pictures and graphics, and too little text, this guide wasn't much of a help when I visited the Algarve. For the Porto region it was better, although some more text would have been nice."
1,What a piece of crap,"I bought this specifically to set up a vpn because the netgear routers I have apparently have bugs in the vpn software that have not been fixed. Cisco, one would think, makes a pretty good product. It came with old firmware so I went to their site and downloaded and flashed the latest firmware to start off on the right foot. So, IE won't look at it because it doesn't like the certificate. Firefox and Chrome will log in (after warning) and although you can see and operate the navigation structure, there is no content so you can't do anything with it. Searching for answers to this problem reveals hundreds of angry and frustrated posts about this product - something I should have done before purchasing it. Fortunately I bought it from Amazon so as soon as I finish typing this it gets boxed up and back it goes. The search for a decent small business VPN router continues but it won't be with Cisco that's for sure."
2,Beware of MTU issues.,"I've purchased this router a few month ago based on relatively good internet reviews. Everything worked Ok besides continuously dropped VPN connections, missing images, style sheets, broken internet pages..etc. I've tried to resolve this issue with CISCO support which is great btw, but was unuseful in my case. The replacement unit had exactly the same issue. It looks like those routers have serious MTU problem, which cannot be configured properly whatever it manual or auto configuration option. The problem could be ISP related (ATT Uverse in my case), however NETGEAR ProSafe VPN FVS338 which I've purchased a week ago works great so far and MUCH faster."
1,Would not buy,"I purchased this product and the first two were defective. I had to pay for the shipping back to Linksys, they refused to pay it. After dealing with their lame tech support overseas for almost a month I finely spoke with someone in tech support here in the United States. The bottom line is in a month and a half no one at Linksys can make the thing work period. They refuse to refund your money even though their own tech support cannot create a VPN tunnel with the device. Linksys used to be an awesome company to do business with but I am done. I am network +, A+ and a MCP. I am done with Linksys and will be selling this product online to try and recoup some of my losses."
1,Not worth it unless you want to be tied in to Linksys products,"This will be a perfect product for linking two of the similar products are to be links. Good for Office to Office connection. We have a few telecomuters who are using Mac and Windows XP and this was the worst purchase I have ever made. If any of the mobile users are using VoIP then just add a ton of issues to this.I am able to connect to my older LinkSys router with Linux, Mac, Windows (all types)"
1,beware of logging issue,"This unit's default, non-editable rule for all outgoing connections is to always log. Unless you create some custom rules for certain traffic types, your firewall log will fill-up quickly with useless info.Also, possible issue with it constantly interpreting a SYNFLOOD error on its WAN1 port when sitting behind a Paradyne DSL router - even with DoS protection disabled."
1,Doesn't connect to the internt,I thought I'd buy a new router to fully take advantage of the new DOCSIS 3 speeds so I bought this thing.Sadly it doesn't connect to the internet though.Back to using my Cisco 870 =)
1,Do Not Buy This!!!,"I ordered two of these in order to use the QuickVPN client to remotely connect to a client office. After a easy install, the QuickVPN worked fine. After a few days I received ""Gateway Not Responding"". I was connected over the WAN to the management web of the unit. I could see the connection attempt with no errors.I called tech support and Linksys said they will email a BETA copy of the QuickVPN software. Try that and call us back. They never emailed it. I packed them both back up and sent them back. Do not waste your money if you want remote VPN."
1,Built in self destruct,"Our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office. After we set them up, it works just fine. We didn't use any of the advanced features at that time. After reading the user's guide and online forum at the Linksys web site, we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is NOT user replaceable. You need to send it in for replacement. Sure enough, we now have two routers that can't retain any configuration settings. They all reset to factary default all of a sudden, one after 1 year, the other after 1 and half year.Also note, we updated one of the router to newest firmware, which prevents any kind of connection from the internet. Needless to say, my boss is really crossed with me because I was the one recommend the model."
3,Emergency replacement,"Needed a replacement router fast and this model from Cisco is the best in it's price-point. However, I wish I'd kept the adapter from my old model because this one came with the European version and I have to wire-wrap the adapter and plug-adapter to the outlet just to keep it plugged in."
3,working so far,"My boss demanded that we get the exact same unit as the one that just failed so that we have the same equipmet as all of our other branches for our vpn. So far it is working, but the one that died was only in use for six months and then got an orange light that would not clear and the whole unit was bricked."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,Needed a dual WAN router to bridge two DSL lines simply for load balancing. I can only get a maximum of 3Mb. With the two DSL lines connected to the RV042 in load balancing mode I immediately was able to download files much faster using my download manager (that initiates up to 16 connections to download the same file).Setup was straightforward using the WEB interface.
1,Disappointed,"Our unit (RV042) worked well in our small business environment for 18 months. Yesterday all clients lost connectivity and I discovered that the router had randomly reset all settings to factory defaults. I reset all settings and the router worked for 12 more hours. Today all clients dropped again and the router is entirely unresponsive with only a solid DIAG light displayed. I have exclusively used Cisco routers and have been satisfied, but I do not recommend this model and I will now question the durability and cost-effectiveness of Cisco routers in the future."
2,Just couldn't get it done,"I'm sure it would work well somewhere, just not for our small business. I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE. It was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was, it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected. After hours on the phone with tech support from Linksys and the DSL Router people, nobody could help. While it connected, it did work very well, it just did stay up. Too Bad."
1,CISCO should be imbarassed to put their name on this POS!,"THIS ROUTER DESERVES ZERO STARS!!!I've set up many routers. THis think is maddening.So i get the new router and automatically upgrade it to the latest software release before any configuration ( v4.2.1.02 (Jan 18 2012 14:10:55))Then I have one simple task - Forward incoming port 41790 to 192.168.0.50.That's it - the simplest feature on any $70 router on the planet. Guess what 3 hours later and the friggin thing still cannon do a simple port forward. I disabled the firewall, set up aUPNP service, set the software DMZ to the IP everything.Still doesnt work - Then I search online and find this has been a probelem with this router since 2007 thru three hardware revs and countless firmware revs. What crap.I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER CISCO ROUTER - THEY HAVE BURNED ME OF THE BRAND FOREVER>BEWARE _ THIS ROUTER WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY _ EVER!!!"
3,VPN Router,The Router was easy to install. I was able to set up the VPN PPTP connection pretty easy. I am still trying to set up the VPN tunnels with little success. I found that the VPN connection may not work if you have a Linksys WRT54G at the outgoing side of the VPN. I had to change out this router to get the VPN's to connect. There not as easy to set up as they say.
3,RV042 < RV082 < RV016,"Before you purchase a RV042, check the RV082 and RV016 carefully - they are similar routers, but have different capabilities. Your needs may not be met by the RV042.Also - no matter what model you buy - before you bein configuration first upgrade the firmware! failure to do so will result in disappointing performance!"
3,"Easy to set up, but sometimes introduces delay","I am not a networking expert, but I was able to easily configure this router, with two WLAN inputs (DSL and Cable), and one ethernet output, which I plugged into my wireless router. I was pleased that there was no trickiness involved -- it basically worked out of the box, and I set it up to balance between my two WLANs, and verified that it could simultaneously handle traffic from both (e.g., one download per connection).However, it seems that in certain states this router introduces some kind of delay, .. I would feel that every time I loaded a webpage, it was taking like 2 seconds to figure out what to do, before routing the traffic and loading the page, because when I switched back to only one WLAN directly into my wireless router, this would not happen. I haven't figured it out yet, but I've found that I just cruise easier without it. I hope this will be easy to fix, since I do like the nominal functionality."
2,I should have read the reviews,I sent this unit back and got the RV082 which works fine.The QuickVPN refused to work with this unit and LinkSys was no help.It does not support the Native VPN Client in XP either.I got the RV082 and use the Native XP VPN client. No extra software and works like a charm.
3,Won't redirect to a different port,"This is a very nice unit. Having VPN tunnels in the router is a great idea.But it can't redirect an incoming connection on port ""X"" to port ""Y"". You can configure port ""X"" to go to an internal IP address, but it must be on port ""X"". That doesn't work in my environment.This is a disappointing limitation on an otherwise excellent product. If you don't need this feature, there's no reason not to buy this."
1,Amazon Showings Wrong Item Picture and Title on this ISBN,"Hey Guys- WATCHMEN rocks! But this particular listing / item, while described as WATCHMEN #1 and showing the COMIC BOOK cover... is actually the graphic novel WATCHMEN (full cover image on smaller book with more pages is the yellow smiley with red drops and is a PAPERBACK BOOK) not the comic book #1 of 12 as would be thought."
2,"Sweet Wind,Wild Wind","I was somewhat disappointed in this book,it was not near the standard I usually read of hers.. It seem to ramble on and on. I found it difficult to stay with.. I hope I can find some better books of hers in the future..."
5,Beautiful conversational coffee cups!,"I own the majority of this ""New Wave"" collection by Villeroy & Boch, because of its beautifully unique design. Yet its simple white porcelain makes it modern enough to accommodate for my ultra-modern dining room. Furthermore, these cups are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than the same cups sold in the big department stores (i.e. Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Neiman's, etc). The only modern downside is that it took about a month for them to arrive (as opposed to me picking them up from the store on the same day). Nevertheless, I love these cups and can't wait to use them."
2,Very ordinate,"This book is not what I expected. In my view, a great cookbook is one that manages to distinct itself from the crowd. None of this is evident here. This book is too wordy, not easy to follow or to search for receipts, basic cooking methods are not covered - just the more sophisticated cooking combinations with multiple ingredients, there are not enough pictures of the ready receipts or how to prepare them (don't be fooled by illustrated - this book is thin on images) and the receipts are rarely inspiring.What is nice about this book is the fluent english of the author that makes a good reading - but if you're looking for a good cookbook - look elsewhere."
4,Comprehensive Cookery Book,"My wife has almost a library of cook books but refers most frequently to only a few. She had a copy of this book for years and used it a lot but recently misplaced it, so I bought her another copy. This is a very comprehensive book. One point to watch though, it is English so some of the units of measure are different to US units. There is, however a conversion table."
5,Great looking ring for the money,I bought this ring in January 2008 and was pleased with it's appearance when it arrived. It's an expensive looking ring for an inexpensive price.It has sharp character and I have gotten many compliments on it since I starting wearing it.I highly recommend this piece.
3,Good for most...,"But they don't seem like they would work for left-handers! Many in my family are lefties. Bummer, though because these are very cool. Too bad they don't have the opposite design."
3,talking watch,"This is a nice watch, it has 3 alarms and one even sounds like a rooster! The ladys voice on it is pleasant and lessy tinny sounding as some are. My only complaint is one does not get enough information on the product. I was buying for a blind person and assumed it gave the time and the date. This watch only gives the time.However, it is a nice watch for the money, just be sure the date is not am important factor on a watch for you."
1,Difficult to understand,The talking watch has a voice that is very difficult to understand. The sound seems to echo in the watch. I would not recommend it.
2,OK PRODUCT,Overall an ok product. The volume could be a little bit louder and the voice clearer. The material could be better as well.
1,BAD BAD COMPANY!,"Recieved bouncer, brand new. Blower did not work. Spent a week calling and faxing and finally got blower in mail. Get this: They sent me a blower that was: a) paint chipped b) large dent C) used D) from, as the invoice said ""GARAGE"". Sent letter with complaint that I bought NEW item and expected a NEW replacement and they have never written or called or responded. WATCH yourself when you buy ""Manly"" and ""TOY QUEST"" products."
1,not as pictured,Very disapointed-not as pictured. It shows a big girl going down the slide and it is not even slideable-very small. The tunnel is just a big hole and the climbing wall is not what expected. I felt very mislead and would not recommend.
2,Great for toddlers,We were shopping for a moon bounce for our 3 kids. The picture on the ad shows children we thought were about 10 to 13 years of age.The item is not as large or comfortable as it looks in the ad.When my 3 year old daughter and 2 year old niece are in the unit no one else can fit.
3,Size does matter.,"After much research I thought I had found the perfect bounce house for my soon to be 4year old son. What boy wouldn't want an inflatable with a punching bag inside. Plus looked big enough to allow for up to four children with plenty of room to go crazy......Was I suprised at how small it was compared to the photo on website. It is half the size of the picture and the slide is so small that you dont even slide down it. Very,very dissapointed and was about to put it back in the box to send back when unfortuately for me as I was postioning it in our back yard it ripped across a down spout and needed a repair. There is a plus side to this story! The repair kit come in very usefull with lots of patches but not enough glue( one tiny poxy tube) but it is super sticky and seems to be holding up extremely well!Plus my son loves his bounce house and fingers crossed we shall get our moneys worth. Please oh Please could you post the correct pictures with accurate sizing in future!"
4,4-8 generalist,"This book has one version of the 4 PPR tests; I took the one for 4-8. When you take the test, the program keeps track of your incorrect answers. You can go through the problems you missed in a review mode. Thorough explanations are offered in support of the correct answers. It was very helpful! This book also has a 7 week study plan. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
4,Good Refresher on material,"I am moving to TX and needed a refresher on Piaget, Bloom, and other items. I am certified to teach science in GA, but I teach 6-12. I only wanted to take one test so I took the EC-12 instead of 6-8 and 8-12 pedagogy. I was a science education major in undergraduate and I am in my master's for the same now, but the book was a help for EC-5 practices. I did the practice tests on the CD (all of them) and scored above what was needed to pass and I read the whole book (not too long due to test in the back) the day before my test. I took the test and scored very well. The book and CD are helpful, but due to my background I think I did better anyhow."
3,Unsure,I bought this book but I did not use it to study for the PPR. I am a first year teacher and I did not study at all for the exam and passed it using the following advice:Answer the questions believing that we are living in a perfect world with perfect school systems and perfect classrooms.Narrow your answer choices down to 2 and then choose the best choice.Assume that there is no hinderance when it comes to money for your school.Sorry I could not provide any info on this specific book...
3,Wedding Daze,"'Wedding Daze' is an easy going, light hearted comedy starring Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher. The idea isn't that original but the actors throw themselves into it so wholeheartedly that you don't really notice. There are a few laugh out loud moments and the rest in pretty amusing too. It isn't too long so you shouldn't get bored. Overall this film is inoffensive and fairly amusing, worth a viewing if you've a spare afternoon to kill.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,It was OK,"Just an OK comedy, not musch to add i bought it for the lead actor/actress, and they were . . . well OK."
1,Wedding Daze,"There are bad movies. There are stupid movies. There are silly, pointless romantic comedies. For others, there should be a scale of badness that's entirely their own. This movie is that movie.Movies like American Pie and There's Something About Mary are smart stupid comedies, movies like Wedding Daze are just plain stupid.If you thought Good Luck Chuck and Shallow Hal were horrible, wait until you see the outrageously, intolerable gags in this lowly film.The whole script is a tutorial on how not to write a screenplay. The entire movie is a Filmmaking 101 lesson - how not to make movies. It's a shame that good actors such as Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher were used, abused rather.There's usually a reason for not releasing movies in the theater, and this movie rightfully set on the shelf for two years before getting a straight-for-DVD release last week. Nonetheless, that was not enough - in this movie's case, the tape it was recorded on should've been destroyed."
1,Wedding Daze,There was a reason this went directly to DVD. It should have gone directly in the garbage can. I am dumber after watching this movie. This movie is terrible. I'm glad I was able to get it free at the library as I would have been mad if I spent a dime. I gave it one star as both parents of both main characters did have a few funny things going but other than that...train wreck.
1,funny but ruined,This could have had something. I threw my copy away because it dragged itself down into crude scenes. They destroyed this film.
4,Be careful.....,Don't buy this as an instructional video!! I've been wanting to learn belly dancing for a while so I bought this. I was far disappointed when I realized you have to already know belly dancing for this. She goes through the steps so quickly you have to at least have an idea of what she's talking about. However I do use the stretching part of the video a lot....
4,new bellydance,This dvd could be perfect if the teacher was not only facing the public. But it's realy great.
2,Come and listen to my story,"When this album was released, The Beverly Hillbillies was the Number One show on TV. Unfortunately, TV ratings didn't translate into record sales in this case. This album was a flop. It's not a soundtrack to the television show, but rather it's a album of comedy songs sung by the cast. Unfortunately, the songs aren't actually all that funny. Sure, there are a few chuckles here, but they are few and far between. Not to mention that most of the cast can't sing very well (although Buddy Ebsen has a decent voice). This album is for Beverly Hillbillies fanatics only."
2,Disppointing read.,What a disappointment. This reads like a cut and paste job--there's no flow from paragraph to paragraph and virtually no personal information about the Dowager Empress. There is however a great deal of politics in the book if that's what you want.
3,Mixed bag,"I'm only about half way through but I think it's okay. Maybe a bit self-satisified. My Dad from Massachsetts, much more conservative, hated it and found it unreadable. He particularly complained about the article on growing food on the commons; it was in Weston, MA - one of the richest towns in a rich state, which lost all credibility."
1,Avellaneda's worse performance,"This is a surprisingly sloppy book written by a known academic in the financial engineering world. That is Marco Avellaneda. At first sight, this book is a good idea. It is suppose to bridge the gap between literature that are too simplified for quants and the high level books that are too mathematically rigorous for pratitioners. However this book is presented in such a sloopy manner that any profit driven company would sack these two authors. There are typo mistakes in almost every page and some fundamental errors. There are numerical examples there are completely wrong. On top of that, who writes a quant book without giving any exercises. The authors should comprehend that mistakes in quantitative books can be very misleading to the reader especially if the reader is trying to learn. If you don't have a Ph.D. in Math, don't read this book. It might do more harm than good."
1,Waste of Money,"1. Too many mistakes 2. Useless mathematical proof without ""real world"" use. 3. If these two guys were really leader in the field, I would expect more."
1,Be Careful,"As a doctoral student of Financial Engineering at an ivy league institution, I found I wasted my time in reading this book. Explanations are inadeqaute, notations when introduced for the forst time are not explained. Materials are randomly introduced. This is one example of how pathetic whole state of affairs of Financial Engineering is. It is dominated by mathematicians, physicists who think the answer to the puzzle of capital market can be found in mathematics rather than developing a economic concept. One is better adviced in reading Duffy's book and not wasting money and time in reading book like this."
2,Poor technical quality,I had been waiting for the release of this movie on DVD for years. I must say I am very disappointed with the very poor image quality. Worse than a VHS! This really good movie deserved better.
3,3 stars,"I bought this DVD because this is one of my favorite Childhood movies. The reason i give it 3 stars however is because the DVD itself has not been re-mastered and so it looks exactly the same as it did on my old Beta max machine, in other words you can tell its super old. However because this is how i remember seeing the movie it didn't really bother me and still enjoyed the DVD format non the less, because its still easier then plugging in old technology . lol"
1,Hocus Pocus,"I was forced to read this piece of garbage in the early 1980s and am surprised that my co-reviewer offered five stars. While Prof. Becker's theories may be stimulating to the Nobel Academy and his Chicago disciples, I found his conclusions vapid and unfulfilling."
2,The Doctor's Guide to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"This book did not really provide helpful information on what you can do about having CFS. It really didn't give me any hope for recovery or improvement. It also did not seem up to date with some of the information. I found ""Fatigued to Fantastic"" to be a much more helpful book for information and action to help try to recover from CFS."
3,ring a Bell?,"Bell's book is now an antique, but I suggest it if you really cannot get a dignosis of that mysterious, painful disease which, among other things, has virtually eliminated any possibility of sustained exercise; that is, provided you can get no meaningful diagnosis of it. Do not expect one. Possibly the most denied, derided, trivialized disease of the Western world, with absurd diagnostic criteria and case definition attributed to it, this ancient echo of reason is an isolated one."
5,Wilton 17202 Grinder,"Very nice. I was suprised at how well it seemed to be built, when I received it. We have had it a while now and its very good. It has plenty of power, its fairly big, well put together, comes with a light that is just enough, and adjustable to where your working. It has a wheel dressing tool that helps once you have worn the wheels. Another nice feature is the rubber mounts under the small stand. You can bolt it to a portable stand or bench, due to the weight of the unit and the rubber mounts I use it and then just move it out of the way. I don't have it bolted. My last grinder needed to be mounted because of its light weight and no traction. Also it has two compartments in the front that are great for puting some water in' to cool small object."
4,Wilton 17202 6 Amp 8-Inch Bench Grinder,Grinder runs smoothly and does all it claims. I found the light unsatisfactory for my shop but I use dedicated lighting so it is not a problem. Grinder is used for sharpening woodworking tools so I replaced the wheels with white wheels to prevent burning. Good product.
3,Good. Not great.,"I am an avid movie/film score collector. I purchased this score because listening to it in the movie, it moved me. I thought it was something that could stand on its own apart from the movie like so many of the other scores/soundtracks that I own (the Crow (sound. & score); Once Upon a Time in the West - Virtually all of Ennio Morricone's work; the works of Elmer Berstein and many of John Williams and Jerry Goldsmiths works.) I am dissapointed. So much was left out of this compilation. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone looking for the high octane score heard in the film. Not to denote Michael Kamen and/or his work. I have seen and enjoyed many a movie where his music plays a grand role. At his craft, he is awesome. But this soundtrack.... it's only okay."
5,My son and I love this book!,"Ms. Tarpley has written a beautiful ode to a father and son tradition - going to the barbershop. She captures the nuance of this treasured neighborhood gathering spot for men. My late father was a barber and I believe my fondness for barbershops stems from that. Thank you for a beautiful book. Mr. Lewis, thanks for the awesome illustrations!"
1,Too big,Dont buy this grease coupler if you want to get into tight spaces. It's considerably larger then the round couplers.
2,Heavy Duty Grease Coupler,"I purchased this grease gun coupler for my husband but like the other reviews, the coupler is really big and does not fit in to tight places. He didn't like it becasue of that but it is heavy duty and very well made."
4,Illuminated letters,"This is a fabulous little resource book by Courtney Davis with 101 celtic illuminated letters. They will be easy to use as is, or adjusting the sizes on the computer if necessary. Davis own letter colouring is quite inspiring. He does offer some history of Celtic illumination however, if I have one criticism it would be that he doesn't give you a product list or basic instructions on how to begin. I guess he figures you already know, or you are a more advanced learner than myself. Having said that I still managed to purchase some goache(?) paints, a brush and some black felt pens and came up with a reasonable product.Very pleased with my purchase, reasonably priced and delivered in good time."
5,A Transcendent Read,"Kem Nunn has produced another masterpiece. America's most underappreciated writer knows how to combine action with gravity, suspense with philosophy and he demonstrates it here with another great book. In ""Tijuana Straits"" Nunn not only creates Sam ""the Gull,"" his usual pill-popping ex-surfer with one last chance at redemption, but also, with equal dexterity, Magdalena, the idealistic Mexican Madonna with a passion for social justice, and, most astoundingly, a fully realized, almost sympathetic villian, Armando, the dark shadow of toxic hopelessness. Add to these memorable characters Nunn's beautiful prose, seamless, swift plot and vivid setting and the result is a novel that satisfies on every level. If you want a transcendent read BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,surfing as metaphor,"Surfers and their natural act are misunderstood. I know, I've been one most of my life. Kem Nunn understands this and effectively weaves the mystery and allure of riding waves into his fine novels.At a time when most people have moved on to other things, surfers search for the next swell(sometimes at great personal sacrifice: e.g. character, Fahey). Redemption is found when someone (Magdalena, in this case) or something is encountered that is worth fighting for. Surfing becomes the perfect metaphor for life: years of struggling and searching infrequently rewarded by slipping moments of bliss."
2,Tiajuana Straights,"A bit slow. Turned out to be something that I was just trying to get through rather than a book that I couldn't put down.A couple of different friends recommended this author, though I wouldn't waste the time reading another of his books. Just too many other good ones out there..."
1,Worst book I have ever read hands down,This book is so bad I tore out every page and threw it away in the trash as I read it. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
1,It's books like this....,It's books like this that make you wish you never learned to read. The lack of an exciting plot was matched by the pathetic character development.
