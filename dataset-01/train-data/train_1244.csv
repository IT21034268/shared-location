3,You can do better...,"I bought this for my god-daughter for Christmas. I actually thought that I was ordering a Schoenhut baby grand, but for some reason I ended up with this.Anyway, it is not a piano. It is a toy, it doesn't sound like a piano, it doesn't play like a piano. It just looks like one and that is about it.Metal rods for the sound, doesn't sound good at all. You hit one key and get multiple notes with very little clarity. And I have to pound on some of the keys to get it to work well or have a clear sound.All in all, I really wish I could return this item get my money back and spend the another 40-50 dollars on a Schoenhut or other good brand of childrens piano. But the day I received it and checked to see if I could return it I could not.I got ripped off. By something else people, this technically isn't even a string instrument...and definatley won't really help in teaching a child music in my opinion."
3,Naaaahhhh!! I wouldn't recommend this one!,"When we initially pulled this out the box, I was excited becaue it was crafted so well! Real wood and excellent craftsmanship - HOWEVER - the sound absolutely sucks! It sounds like Elmo's toy piano, or even worse. I thought it was just the fact that the piano was sitting flat on the floor (I hadn't installed the legs yet), and the sound was just off. By the time I got everything assembled, the disappointment settled in even deeper. This piano was not worth the price I paid for it - by any stretch of the imagination. I realize this is a TOY and not an instrument; but again, for the money, you'd expect a better sounding product. An added note: my daughter LOVES banging on it!"
2,Poor build quality,"Bought a similar pink version of this grand piano for my daughter's 3rd birthday. The piano was defective right out of the box, 4 keys has no sound to it, some of the strikers are stuck in the ""up"" position.The piano promptly went back to the store and we'll be shopping for another brand."
2,Poor Quality & Sound,"I bought this piano for my 15 month old daughter for Christmas 2008. My sister first noticed that the keys were not lined up straight. It was very easy to put together, but the sound and quality were horrible. We could hardly press the keys down to hear anything. I boxed it back up and returned it asap! Don't waste your time or money on getting this product. I just bought a new schoenhut piano and hopefully this will be of better quality and sound."
2,i wan't to know what happens with this,"never receive this product, and i will resolve this situa<tion for shopping in the future, thanks"
5,A Modern Classic!!,"I'm a well educated, ie former attorney, American male, 65 years old. Born & raised a Roman Catholic, but not a practicing Catholic for decades; I enjoy exploring & reading @ spritual & religious topics; I consider myself, with a huge tongue in check, an amateur metaphysician. I've read 20 - 30 - 40 books in this area during the past 15 years. This is the best! Period. I think that @ age 40, I would not have been able to understand this book or what Moody was trying to teach; as I grew older, more intrsospective, & more torn by ambiguity, I found the subject matters of this book much more ""pressing"". If you read 1 book @ the spiritual aspects of maturity @ the 50+ stage of life, I suggest you start your explorations with this 1! A classic!"
5,Begin Real Life IFR Training...,"After you pass the instrument check ride, the most daunting task is actually launching into IMC. Before you do, leave the test prep behind, read this book, and begin working towards actual IFR proficiency.Once again, Dick Collins shares his extensive experience in a well-written, information-filled text that every IFR pilot should read and heed."
2,Near Death Experience,"Foster died about 7 years after this tape was made. Unfortunately, he seemed a lot closer after viewing this performance. He took incredibly long to tell several jokes. He wasn't his typical self."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!,"I bought this not even 2 years ago for small use in kitchen. Well,suddently not working,got it checked and main ciruit board is shot. Will cost more to repair than it cost which was over $300 in 12/05. Magnavox just told me today( becuase of one yr warranty) they will sellme another one for $218 plus tax and have only a 3 month warranty.They probably were going to send me a refurbished one and I declined. THis TV was only for morning coffee use and while I cooked in kitchen. I usually don't buy an extended warranty but after dealing with this electronics company , I guess we will have to rethink it. I will never BUY another Magnavox TV again and suggest the same for anyone else."
1,Stay away from this TV.,"I have owned this TV for about 10 months and am currently looking to replace it. The sound is TERRIBLE. Even though the volume goes to 100. The actual sounds tops out around 25 (the rest is for show). I tried hooking up external speakers, but it just amplifies the static & makes the problem worse. The picture quality is also very rapidly decreasing (fuzzy). Also DISH Networks universal remote is NOT compatible with this set. So plan on keeping 2 around if using DISH. Finally.... Check out MAGNAVOX's own website. They don't even offer support for this TV. Should say something about the quality."
4,Still Works Great After several years,"This is a Kitchen TV so it needed to fit in small area without interfering, and be reliable with adequate volume. I bought this refurbished at a great Price. Still works great after several years and a lot of use."
4,"Nice little tv, terrible volume tuner!","I was given this tv as a Christmas gift in 2005. It is actually a nice, lightweight, compact, flatscreen tv. The picture is great and it hooks up nicely to your pc as a monitor too. I even had it mounted on my wall in my workout room and it looked great. The downside is the volume tuner is so bad. I once had it to its highest output and the volume was still so low. The only thing to do is turn the volume down to the lowest and turn off your tv and cable/satellite receiver box. Then turn it back on and try turning the volume up, frequently it will adjust to sound louder but what a pain (this will really drive you crazy). I finally hooked it up to a small shelf stereo system I had and connected the tv audio to the stereo so it was like surround sound and the stereo receiver became the volume control (thank goodness!)."
4,Find one that works and its not bad.,"I had to take the first one back....fuzzy fonts, ghosting, and one dead pixel. So I took it back to the retailer where I got a GREAT deal on this TV, and the second unit I tried worked perfectly with a much improved picture, expecially on the XBox.I bought this for my son for Christmas so I'm glad to know it doubles as a computer monitor with a built in VGA port. That'll save some money. Nice and bright with good colors, I like it.BTW, the retailer I returned the first unit too commented they had taken ""a lot"" of these back today. Not worth $300, but if you can find it for a steal....."
2,Returned it.,"Cable picture is poor. Sound is terrible. Despite matching its progressive scan capabilities with a progressive scan DVD player, it DID NOT meet George Lucas' picture specifications (which can be accomplished by tube-televisions over 10 years old). Too bad Sony has discontinued making anything under 20"".Bottom line is- if you have an eye and ear for detail- do not buy this TV."
2,Great TV while it lasts,"I bought this TV two years ago and and was thrilled with it. It had a great picture and the size was just what I needed. Imagine my disappointment when, as I was watching a show the other night, the picture goes out completely. I can hear everything, but the picture is gone. It's going to cost more to fix it than it is to replace it. There's no excuse for a TV dying after only a couple of years."
3,Very low volume levels,"I've had this set for a few years and have had only one major problem with it. That problem is with the magnitude of the volume. The sound quality isn't so great, either, but sometimes the volume is so low that you can barely hear it, even if the volume is turned all the way up.To be fair, part of the problem is with my cable service (at&t; Uverse), which uses STB boxes that emit lower sound levels than others I've used in the past (mainly Comcast). However, it's always had this problem, regardless of the STB box used, and I don't have this problem with STB's connected to other televisions.It's really disappointing, because otherwise, this would be a nice, little television. I've even tried hooking it up using different connections, but the problem persists.Because of this problem, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,Great for kitchens...if u have excellent hearing!,"The color and definition are excellent.We wanted a small TV for our kitchen counter....and it fit the bill, it seemed.Not so fast.....it's loudest volume has us straining to hear.The good thing is we are a bit quieter at dinner, or we can't hear the TV.However, I am told, If I have the room for unsightly wires, I can add speakers to help this situation disappear....but, why would I want to clutter the area with more stuff?So, it would be best to buy this TV for a bedroom or child's room, and not a busy area...or you'll be doing a lot of shushing!"
3,"It's ok if you want a simple 15"" tv with a few extra inputs","The monitor works well, the picture is good, I've had it maybe 6+ months and bought it for the office. I hooked it up to a cable and did a quick scan and it worked.. BUT when i tried to connect it to a HD ant, I found that it wouldn't pick up HD without an external tuner. This is the reason for the 3-Star rating - to me any 'monitor' that requires an external HD tuner, isn't HD. For me this is nothing more than a flat panel monitor with a standard tuner and few extra connections (something you can find at any computer store). I probably should give it a high rating since I haven't had a problem with it along with the fact that it only cost me about $100 (refurbished)."
3,"Hmmm, what did I miss?","Maybe with time this will work itself out...but right now, I can't seem to get the darn thing to work well. Granted I live in a place where there is no cable; granted the instructions are written so small I can hardly read them. I'm not finding it easy to get this TV to work well! It's difficult to even get the color right when I'm watching a DVD... Oh well, maybe I'll edit this in a few weeks. I'm a little disappointed..."
2,Television Not Advertised as Refurbished,"I received my Magnavox 15"" LCD screen television and gave it as a gift to my spouse for Christmas. I installed two days after Christmas and my spouse noticed a spot on the screen. I called the online store I purchased from through Amazon and they were very pleasent. They would issue an RA for the television to go back. I had already disposed of the packaging and I expressed concern for shipping the item back as I did not have the original shipping container. I asked if they could just send me a new Television, charge my card and I could then send the old TV in the shipping container of the new TV. They would not do this. I am stuck with the old TV and the Pixel dot on the screen due to this fact. As a customer, I am dissatisfied due to the fact the online store would not work with me even though I was willing to charge a second television on my card so I would have the proper shipping container to send the old TV back.Damon Owens"
3,"Not bad but, you can find thse same thing for less","This is not a bad LCD by any means. The picture is pretty good and at least it is a brand name you have heard of. However, many very similar sized LCDs are on the market for $50 - $100 less now that the holiday season is upon us. This one will likely drop in price also.One thing to note about this there are no vesa mounts on the back of the LCD. Instead the stand that comes attached to the screen flips around to hang from a wall. The problem is that the movement of the screen once on the wall is very limited and actually seems a bit flimsy. I would only buy this if it was going to sit on a desk or counter."
1,Lousy TV-Lousy Customer Service from Phillips,"I bought this TV for my kitchen in Jan. 06. It is used very little (I don't cook much!) By March 06, the picture would shut off in about 20 minutes but the sound would remain on. We were told to send it back (we paid the $25.00 shipping) and they would fix it. They sent it back saying nothing was wrong. THEY WERE WRONG! Now I was told to send it back again(we pay the $25.00 shipping again) and they will send me a new one! I agreed to pay the first $25.00 but didn't feel I should pay it again when they didn't fix it the first time! They refused to budge. So I guess I am out $50.00 bucks and they are sending me another lousy tv. What's that one going to cost me? Stay away from this t.v. and stay away from Phillips!"
1,Utter Failure,"i responded to an email asking me to rate the sale and all i can say, once again, is that I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM. i wanted to use ""zero"" stars, but i did not have that option."
2,Not all colors fit the same.,"These jeans fit well, but beware...the different colors all fit differently. I will only buy these at a store that I can try them on. The last time I ordered them one pair fit and the other two had to be returned."
5,"The best fitting jeans, EVER!!","I bought a total of 6 pairs of these jeans and I must say I think they are FABULOUS. Not too low waisted, plenty long in the rise to cover my tummy, BUT they fit in the waist, too!! These are not your skinny jeans with no fit, they fit everywhere! Some of the different fabrics came out of the dryer a little wrinkled, but I just hang them up and they straighten right out. Excellent cut, excellent fit, excellent wear ability."
5,"Most flattering, and most comfortable jeans I've found.",Just want to add my praise for these jeans. I have 6 pair. Didn't know they come in corduroy! I'm going to start looking for those.
1,Didn't get the right jeans,"I was so excited to see Amanda stretch jeans! They're very hard to find and they're my favorite. Unfortunately, I received Classic Fit jeans instead! I contacted the seller but received no response. After several days, I finally contacted Amazon and they resolved the issue. But I still didn't get my stretch jeans, which was a disappointment. I ordered them around Christmas, and it was a good thing they weren't a gift."
1,should be 0 stars,Misses Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda Stretch Denim Jeans terrible....I recieved seconds instead of product I paid dearly for.
1,unhappy,I think it is rediculus that you can't offer size 4 misses in any other color than black.I like the way they fit but I don't want to wear black everyday. You sure do offer many colors in larger sizes Not everyone is a large person.
5,Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans,"I love being able to find the GV Jeans online.........in my size when I need them. Sometimes it is not possible to find the right clothing, in the correct sizing, in local department stores. I have been wearing GV Jeans for many years now........and I know that, even when I purchase them online........they will fit me correctly."
5,Best Fitting Jeans Ever!,"I just purchased these jeans and they are the best jeans I have ever worn and I wear alot! I am 5'11.5 and their longs are perfect. I am not a small person and these jeans are great--you will not be disappointed. I am glad they are coming back strong into the marketplace as I am stocking up. The Amanda Jeans are exceptional--they are light weight, great length, fit mid-large hips perfectly and more than that--they are extremely comfortable....My hope is that they never stop manufacturing the Amanda style-jean."
5,love em',"I have been wearing these for years and I love them. They fit perfectly and are so soft. The only thing is, if you buy short, like I do, they will shrink up after several washings. So if they fit right at first, eventually they will shrink up. I now hang to dry."
1,Do not order this ball,I ordered a ZR65AB anti burst fitness ballThey give you a very handy tape to wrap around the ball so that you can know when the ball is properly inflatedI blew up the ball it is a lot smaller than 65cmI then looked at the box and instructions.No where did it say anti burst.The model number on the box is ZR65I am returning the ball to Amazon
2,Doesn't work with iTunes 4.0.1.,"Good luck getting iTunes 4.0.1 to see this drive. This is a major deal if you want to burn a music CD from Apple's new AAC file format (as opposed to a MP3) because you can only do that from within iTunes. Aside from not working with iTunes and the fact that the unit is very loud when it has spun up, the unit seems to do its job and Mac OS X recognized the burner without having to install any software. I will be returning this drive."
4,Good book to learn calculus,"I purchased these books because these are the ones I use in my calculus AB class. They were firtst recommended by the district and I do supplement work to prepare students for the AP test, but the books have plenty of prblems to do and it is not difficult to read."
4,not bad for the price,"frankly any dvd authoring software under say $200 is not particuarly powerful.this one is however one of the best. I use several different programs to make my home like videos. I have found not one package in this price range to let me design the 'menu' the way I want.. that is like the ones the commercial movies have.this one is no exception. But it does have a lot of features for the price. Including one I use every day... namely editing out commercials. it's called multi cut and trim. Of the ones in this price range it is the only one that has it (that seems to actually work).caution, it is a slow program. slower then some less capeable programs.you might consider their more costly editing program but you won't get much more flexability."
2,Out of date,"Not impressed with the patterns in this book. Very ""dated"" looking and patterns are difficult to decipher. I should have returned it."
1,This is real bad...,"I have followed this band from my teens to my adulthood, and have seen them at least a dozen times-they are my heros! Unfortunately, I have to give this one star-I am sorry but Siouxsies' voice is absolutely cringe-inducing, I saw this tour 3 times in 2002, and her voice was the same too. I kept hopeing it would get better-but it didn't. I am really surprised they put this out. Sioux is so off key, her range is shot-and the band isn't that great either. It's a shame; but hey-they do have some AMAZING studio albums!"
1,I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK,"I TRIED TO GET INTO THIS BOOKBUT I COULD NOT.. I AM A QUICK READERBUT THIS TOOK ME TWO DAYS... IT WAS BORING""PATRICIA WAS IGNORING..THIS IS THE FIRSTBOOK I DIDNT LIKE FROM MS.CELESTE..BUTMAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE THIS STORY"
4,Evolution of Spatial History,"Fascinating stuff, in an exhaustingly thorough book, that really should be a must for all students of architecture. Read this and it may explain a lot. Condensed, concise history of theories in Architecture . Buy it. Read it."
5,Interesting,"I was excited to get this book as my uncle, Kenneth Gundling, is mentioned in it. I haven't read all of it, but what I have read is very interesting. The author is a great writer. Considering how old the book is, it was in really good condition."
5,Helpful for survivors and their allies,A Safe Passage to Healing is by far one of the best books written on this deeply painful and often overwhelming subject. I'd highly recommend it to survivors of ritual abuse and those who love them. This book is full of helpful chapters that will gently enlighten and provide some sense of comfort to the reader.Chrystine Oksana has a deep sense of compassion and understanding when discussing some of the most difficult experiences ritual abuse survivors overcame. She's structured her book in easy to read short chapters providing short breaks in the author's narrative for those who may be upset by reading this material. Chrystine also gives the reader trigger warnings ahead of time when difficult subject matter is approaching.Overall it's a very easy read and survivors and those who love them will walk away with a greater understanding of ritual abuse and a deeper sense of compassion for those who successfully endured it.
4,Excellent product...,Very good purchase & fast delivery; needs a little more factory sharpening. In general it's a very good accesory for open water and deep water fishing.
3,Not bad.,I just like Sue May Pratt. But if you don't then pick another unless you like odd films. She has been in better films.
5,"A magical, lyrical movie you'll not soon forget!","When Jakob Magnuson, a young, successful German theatrical producer, loses his eyesight in an auto accident he wallows in despair and is convinced his life is no longer worth living. He pushes away those who care about him, even Lilly Walter, a young blind social worker from the rehabilitation institute who wants to help him learn to adjust to being sightless. But Lilly does not give up on Jakob. Thus begins an improbable, yet totally believable, journey through Europe during which Jakob finds a reason to go on with his life. In the process he and Lilly also discover each other. This film has marvelous cinematography, and the Hilmir Snaer Gunason and Fritzi Haberlandt are unforgettable as Jakob and Lilly. The soundtrack is wonderful also. A movie to savor again and again."
3,Good selection of tools for the price but very poor quality !!!!!!,"Tools and the box can be rated as substandard. Everything in the box is poorly built for regular use. Tools are useful in an emergency situation but not for regular use. When box is opened, many of the tools fall off. the grip to hold the tools is very poor."
5,Wonderful Tool Set,"Boght this as a started tool set for my son's best friend (my ""bonus"" son). Wonderful set for a vehicle."
3,Decent,Works out OK but make sure you see what's included before purchasing. The case doesn't evenly close often and the tools slip out of their slots as well.
3,Kind of worked...,"The case it comes in is terrible. Hinges broke within 2 days, and some items never fit properly in their place. Crescent wrench broke within a week. The kit comes with a lifetime warranty, and I will update this when I contact them.The price is good, and it comes with a lot of useful items like a tire pressure gauge, spark plug gauge, and wire strippers."
4,Handy when your in a Bind.,I bought this Product to carry on my boat. It is what the photo shows. Driver has magnetic tip for those hard to reach places. An this kit is a fairly will rounded. You could also carry it in your car or truck an still save space. Its always go to carry the basic tools because you never no when you'll need them. Also well Priced.
3,"Cheap, But Not Terrible","I've had this tool set for a few years and it works OK. One of the hinges on the case has broken, so it it is a hassle to open and close. Also, one of the allen wrenches isn't quite the correct size."
4,Smartmedia 128mb,First I would like to say it is nice to find the media online as this is no longer carried in the chain stores for retail. Second the price was very reasonable and the produt was delivered secure and promptly.
4,Good purchase,"Hi - I need this somewhat outdated card for my somewhat outdated Korg ESX. I bought a generic one from China that failed previously, but this one does the trick. thanks, Corey"
1,Cheap fake!,This did not work for me. This is the second card I have purchased that was not a genuine Smart Media card and I will be purchasing a genuine one next. I thought I could save some money buying an off brand but instead I have wasted my time which is more valuable.
4,Good,"Reliable product for 1-2 yrs. after that period of time, the information vanishes because too many in & out of camera and card reader,"
2,Misleading Picture,"Purchased what was pictured as a fully Olympus friendly SmartMedia card. By this I mean it supports the slick Panorama feature in my Olympus camera. The picture of the product on the Amazon web screen where I made my purchase showed an Olympus SmartMedia package with bold printing ""Supports Panorama Features"". What I received was a Samsung SmartMedia card. I have no problem with the quality of this brand, but it does does not support the Panorama feature in the camera. It otherwise works fine. Very disappointed not to have the full capability I was looking for. In re-looking at the web site, the card is described as a Samsung SmartMedia card, but the picture of the product showed an Olympus brand SmartMedia package."
5,Completely Satisfied,"I stopped at several stores looking for this product to no avail. We desperately needed more space on our field camera. I was pleased to find it available on amazon.com from ShopTronics and receive free shipping. The smart card came well protected in the packaging and we received it within a week. The price was reasonable so I ordered two.Charlotte R. with Encompass Technical Design, LLC"
4,Good Media Storage,"We have 4 of these Smartmedia cards and, for the most part, they have lasted us a long time. I have had one that stopped holding memory but I am unsure of the reason. So 3 out of 4 ain't bad. I do like the 128 MB and can usually get 80 high quality pictures on it."
5,Very good card,Samsung SmartMedia 128MB Digital Flash Memory Card This card has functioned well. The price was good and delivery was quick. I could not be more pleased.
5,Smartmedia 128mb,I was glad to find this card. It is hard to find a smartmedia card nowdays.The card workd great and the shipping was fast.Thanks!!!
4,Samsung SmartMedia 128MB,"The card is performing as well as the original and other cards Ihave purchased. One of the original cards has lasted over 10years, hopethis one will do as well."
5,Saving our pictures.,"In our old camera (Olympus) that we love, it is nice to have a source to get more cards that fit. It works very well."
5,just some awesome ratcheting wrenches,"I've has the metric versions of this wrench set for several years and have wanted to get the SAE set. The gearwrench products are very high quality. I've never felt any flex when I use them and have never had one fail. They were a little costly, but I was able to snag this set burring Amazons black Friday week cyber deals campaign."
2,Didn't work in the PC,"I was trying to add RAM to my wife's PC to max out its wimpy 1Gb RAM capacity. Though my machine takes PC2100 DDR, and should have worked, it did not. Sent it back, and am awaiting the credit back to my acct."
2,They do hurt your ears and the sound quality is sub par.,"I agree w/Christian, these do hurt when you use them. The earpiece looks like they can deliver good sound straight into your ear canal, but they hurt and don't deliver high quality sound. The sound that these deliver is like the sound from headphones you get from a ""Made in China"" cd player (w/headphones). Stay away."
2,Arg- my poor sore ears!,"Oh my- these earbuds look pretty cool, but they hurt your ears! Something about them doesn't fit the ears quite right, and it makes them sore to wear, and taking them off is really painful. If you have really big ears, maybe these would be ok, but otherwise, buy at your own peril."
2,Didn't last,This pools top ring never stayed inflated beyond the first day of use. We used it till the end of summer just inflating the bottom two rings.
5,Lucky day,"I'm so glad I picked up this book! I read it straight through in a sitting one day. The stories are so fascinating, but each one is different...I kept wondering, what if that happened to me? Could I do something to make this happen to me or not happen to me? Read this book and open up your mind to the phenomenon of luck."
3,"A fun read, but...","I checked this out of the library recently, and yes, it's fascinating to read about these people's lives and how they have coped with various kinds of luck. If you've got a plane ride in your future or a day at the beach, bring this along.Piven is an interesting writer, but employs some gimmicks that can misfire. For example, he starts each story with a striking detail from the middle of the story. Distracting and confusing? Could be for some, but it really hooked me. Also, every story is told in the present tense, which I found odd.What's less than successful is the author's attempt to cobble together a scientific framework for the stories; worse yet is the last chapter, which reads like a 'PowerPoint' presentation on things we can do to manage our own luck.On balance, though, it's readable and interesting."
3,Just Mindless Fun,"A rich elderly woman is being conned by a fraudulent psychic. The psychic uses a unknown ritual to try to fool a true psychic that was hired to see if the fraud was for real. Of course, as you can guess, the fraud successfully conjures up a demon, and of course, a few of the guests die one by one.I enjoyed the characters in this movie and the demon is a bit corny, but it's still a fun flick. The dialogue and acting is good. I've seen a lot of poorly made B movies, and this isn't one of them. The lighting, dialogue and character development make this an enjoyable movie.I wish I knew whether the upcoming DVD was widescreen or not? This flick, if the transfer to DVD is good, would be a nice addition to my collection."
2,Looks good/Produces bad toast,"This toaster looks good on your counter and is very sturdy. However, the toaster's raison d'etre is to produce toast, and at least mine produces very inconsistent toast. When I set the toaster on 3 (out of 8) and put a piece of wheat bread in, it is usually 'well done' on the side that faces the center, brown on the top part that faces the outside, and barely done on the bottom part that faces the outside.The bun toasting feature, which works pretty well, is its only saving grace.My Sunbeam toaster that I bought for 15 dollars was better than this one."
2,"Looks nice, poor quality","Bought one 3 years ago. Within a few weeks, the rubber foot ""melted"" and rubber kept getting on my counter top. Then the foot finally disintegrated. And a week ago the heating elements broke and it now burns the toast on the lower half of one side. Disappointing considering the hefty price; this is not a $20 toaster after all. Do not recommend."
3,"Good, but poor flow","The recommendations in this book remain poignant, but are far from revolutionary new ideas. Although this was recommended to me by individuals who recommend it to a lot of people, I fear it is for lack of having awareness of some better alternatives.The basic concept of emotional intelligence can be understood via a short article. This book is simply an expansion of an article with countless (albeit decent) examples of both successful and unsuccessful implementation of the principles.Alas, this remains just another in a series of similar books and it is far from the best. The ""5 Disciplines"" and even the classic ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" are probably equally enlightening as well as better written and more interesting to read.Those are just my two cents."
2,Could fit in the article,"I had to read the book for the class and I felt pretty bad about wasting my time. The content could easily fit just in one article. Some good points, but in the overall didn't enjoy the style and haven't found a lot of valuable thoughts."
5,Primal Leadership-Daniel Goleman,The best book I've ever purchased and it was in excellent shape and arrived sooner than expected.
2,Phd level fluff piece,"If I wasn't forced to read this book for a class, I wouldn't have made it past the first chapter."
3,Comments on Primal Leadership,"Way to many pages to comment on the six leadership styles, resonant versus dissonantleaders and the four fundamentals of Eomotional Intelligence.However these three concepts are worth looking at and all the rest is written to justify the price."
1,Very boring,"This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book."
2,"Hard to read, hard to get into this....good info","This book was just hard to get into-I love reading books on leadership in general, this came highly recommended, and I was determined to read it, but it did not keep me engaged. It is at best interesting at times during story telling. The content is very good and full of great information; perhaps I didn't care for the writing style."
4,Interesting Audio Book,"I have many audio books, and sometimes travel a lot and alone. So, it is good time to get a good subject like PRIMAL LEADERSHIP and listen that. It is a positive approach on leadership, I consider most of the comments really true. For the young guys that want to be leaders in the future, I recommend that!"
1,Old wine in new bottles,"As a professor of organizational behavior I fully embrace the concept and notion of emotional intelligence, but not how Goleman has defined it. Others have done more solid work than has Goleman, but unfortunately they have not received much credit. Serious scholars of intelligence (social, emotional, or practical) don't really take Goleman very seriously, and it is sad to see ""hype"" and attention Goleman gets.As regards Mr. Goleman's recent escapades into leadership all I can say is that what he has recently discovered has [already] been discussed previously by many scholars of charismatic leadership (and related theories of inspirational, and Pygmalion leadership)."
5,Very satisfied in both medium and content,"This is the first time I have purchased a CD (audio book). I am doing an MBA and the reading is overwhelming. I felt this would be a break from reading to listening to the book.Well, what a great choice. This book is an excellent book and the medium for delivery even greater.I play it over and over again, I have shared it with friends (all are buying theirs)Very impressive structure and research in this CD book. Goldman proves again that clear sight into people and management of people (including yourself)."
3,Ok for a light read,"I was looking for a light book on leadership that at least made an attempt to be based on research. This one is ok. It has made me think about the art of leadership from an emotional perspective.What I strongly dislike about this book, and most books like it, is that it discusses corporate leadership as if it is the only kind of leadership that is important in life. It was unnecessary for the authors to assume that the reader would be a corporate exec. If the book is really about leadership, then the authors ought to assume that the reader is interested in leadership in general. If the book was intentionally written for a corporate audience, then say so in the title."
4,Book is OK if you don't already lead this way.,"If you already lead this way, and work for people who don't, you may find yourself at odds with them. I was hoping to find some insight on how to be a primal (caring) leader and survive in a 'management by intimidation' world. I don't want to swim with sharks or lead like Gingus Khan, I want to be a servant leader like Jesus Christ but prosper in business. That is the real challenge and I haven't found the answers in this book yet. Maybe I should have started reading it from the back and not the front."
2,"Catchy title, terrible book","Well, as a reference book in a medical library this would be a great fit, but for leaders looking to do more this book is off topic. The scientific nature of this book provides great bits of info, but it also makes the 350 pages feel more like 3,000. If you are looking for a way to reach people emotionally try Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends & Influence People. If you want to know how those techniques affect the neurological system this might work for you."
4,Good aproach to behaviour leadership,This is one of the best books I have read about Leadership from the behaviour point of view. It is very well organized and s very easy to read. A good help to any manager in all businesses.
4,Refreshing,"I picked this book up on a whim, and I was very surprised how much it pertained to my life. I found this book to be very insightful and refreshing. The ideas and concepts put forth seem so simple and full of common sense, yet very few people seem to practice them. I think this is a must read for people who want the most out of life and their relationships."
5,This book is excellent!,"I have read a couple of books on emotional intelligence, but this one is, by far, the best. The depth of insight, the way concepts are explained and the examples that are given make it easy to understand, relate to and apply what you learn. I got a great deal from this book. It was especially encouraging to me because it validates many of the things I believe in and that we are working to build into the culture of our organization. I will read this book many times. To me, it is a treasure chest of valuable information."
2,No need for warm and fuzzies for needed leadership,"The premise of Primal Leadership, based on Goleman's popular ""Emotional Intelligence"", is that people need to be made to feel good to be lead. Actually, this is not true: often times leadership is getting what needs to be done when people feel awful. Those being lead need just to believe in their contribution to the endeavor, and they can act accordingly. For a superior, much briefer description of leadership, see the Harvard Business Review's recent article ""The Work of Leadership"", or the work of ISVORDilts. Whereas Goleman was quite good in Emotional Intelligence, ""Primal Leadership"" misses the mark."
3,Th efirst novel I ever read.,"When I was a child many years ago this book was this first novel I read completely by myself.This simple story is not well written for an adult, but for a child....This is an awesome novel.This book while not a great work of fiction ignited my passion for reading at a tender age."
3,misleading packaging,"my daughter has been really wanting this so she got it for hannukah. here's the one big issue - one that the manufacturer has not responded back to me (and they promise to respond within 48 hours - it's been 3 weeks) - the packaging does NOT state that the USB is PC only. it just says USB, and any computer has USB ports, it's an industry standard (there's no difference in a mac or pc USB port). but the key cannot be used on a mac. so if you get one and you have a mac, you have to find a pc you can borrow to register and set up a username & password online, and then my daughter can use this on our mac without the key. just keep that username and p/w nearby.but she's been having a blast online once we got set up."
1,Such a disappointment,"This product was ordered for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She has to be the biggest ""Bratz"" fan alive. She was completely disappointed that the ""online"" feature of the toy did not work. My husband is very computer savvy and he couldn't even get it to function right. The doll itself was fine, just the online jazz was not very jazzy at all!!"
3,Bratz and computers,"I purchased this for a friend's daughter and they had trouble getting it started online, but they were having computer problems as well. I told them to call Customer Service so I hope it is working for them now. My daughter has one and since we are running Vista, she had to go to my neighbors house and set up her Be-Bratz on their XP computer. She had no problem though and it works now on any computer without the stick. She likes it but does not play with it a lot. It is limited as to what you can do online. She enjoys the doll though."
4,Great toy,MGA Bratz Be-Bratz.Com Blonde HairI bought this toy awhile back when it was cheaper...... on amazon for a christmas gift for my niece........ she is ten and she loves this toy......you can do alot of differnt things with this toy.........well worth the price.............
3,Be-Bratz,"My 10 year old daughter received this as a Christmas gift from her grandmother. She was very excited to use it right away. We jumped on the computer Christmas morning, plugged the key in and received an error message. Tried it on our other computer same thing. It appears the website was down. She was very disappointed not to be able to play with her new toy.However, we waited a few days and tried again. Plugged the key in and away we went. The website launched, she got herself registered with little help from me and played for hours. The mouse that came with the doll won't work on the her computer. The mouse pad that came with it, is really only usful if you can use the provided mouse because it's so small. She played with it for a few days and has since lost interest in it."
3,"Problems to get on, but daughter has fun on the site","Well, the USB key never worked from day one - it wouldnt even recognize on my mac - then had to go to a friends house who had a pc and it wouldnt work their either, got the ""just in case"" file to finally open and i got the url to type it... then problem after problem with the website... perhaps I should give them some slack since it was Christmas, but the site wasnt working correctly until after the 29th and only if it was about 0300 a.m.Now that I have her all signed up (which is signing her up, then having to make a parent account for myself) she can get on and she has fun setting up her Bratz's room and pet accessories and such. Just a pain to get set up to begin with."
2,A Downward Spiral Into Jealousy and Doubt,"They say there is an audience for almost every book, but you better check this one out carefully before you decide it's for you. I had high hopes for ""Her"" because I thoroughly enjoyed Laura Zigman's debut novel, ""Animal Husbandry,"" but this story showed neither the promise nor the hilarity of its predecessor...."
3,Stalking and Paranoia 101,"I heard this was a funny book, but what I didn't hear was that the protagonist was a psycho-stalker. She is so self-absorbed and such a whiner that she made me want to grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her. Definitely do not purchase this book. I'm grateful I got it from the library."
4,"Far, far better than other reviewers indicate","Chick lit, at its finest, should not just be about cuddling up with new best fictional friends on a rainy afternoon. And this is very nearly chick lit at its finest. The plot of ""Her"" is brilliantly simple: your fiance's ex-fiancee comes a-calling. Cue mayhem. The characters however, and despite the book being a zippy read, are anything but simple. This is a witty, literate, uneasy novella about functional insanity on the path to marriage. Personally, I would have ditched the last 6 slightly soggy paragraphs. Otherwise the rest of it - with its fascinatingly unreliable narrator - is extremely deftly written. Not a great pick for brides-to-be, to put it midly. But huge unsettling fun for the rest of us."
1,"Written so poorly, I couldn't even finish it...","The idea for the book sounded fun and interesting. However, when I cracked open the book, I discovered what others here warned me about. I did notice at the back of the book a note stating the type face in which she wrote the book, but different is not always good. It was horrible. Huge run on sentences with about 10 commas thrown in. Come on, what sentence needs 5-10 commas? Special type face or not, she should have stuck with what she knew and written this book in a way that would appeal to other chick lit readers. I tried hard, but only got through about 10 pages. Thank goodness I didn't buy it! Back to the library it goes...unread..."
2,Skip it,"Like other reviewers, I believe this effort does not measure up to the author's first two novels. What I loved about those two books is her ability to weave really astute and insightful observations about life and love into her stories. I kept waiting for that to happen with this book, but it didn't. This is meaningless fluff from an author who is capable of much better.This is slapstick comedy with annoying, one dimensional characters. There may be a small laugh or two along the way, but those don't make up for this completely unbelievable plot.Skip this one and read her first two novels. You won't be sorry."
4,Very entertaining!,"I thought this book was a fun read. Sure, the main character is neurotic, but I liked her anyway . . . and who among us has never felt jealous about our significant other's former love? Okay, so maybe it's not ""Wuthering Heights"" -- it's still a pleasant way to spend an afternoon! I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen in this love triangle."
5,A Perfect Summer Book,"Funny, funny, funny. Smart, smart, smart.This is the first book of Zigman's I've read and I loved it.I bought it at the airport and embarrassed myself on the plan I laughed so hard. Can't wait to read the first two."
2,"A disappointment, though at times quite funny","I expected much more from this book. It sounded promising. While reading it, I came to feel as if the main character was actually psycho in her pursuit of the ex. Also, I kept waiting for something really BIG to happen and turn everything around. But the pages kept turning and turning with no such luck. The ending proved better than the rest, but not enough that I would recommend it to anyone. In closing: Not a complete waist of time, but I wish I'd read something else."
2,Elise? Intelligent?,"She's a paranoid idiot, really, and her much-vaunted ""intelligence"" doesn't do anything to save her from her vicious -- and self-created, for the most part -- cycle of jealously and self-loathing. She's not Bridget, okay? Not even CLOSE. Bridget was crazy. Bridget was original. Bridget was laugh-out-loud funny. Elise is none of these things, and Zigman's writing makes it all too clear that she is trying to make Elise ALL of these things...It's almost complete [junk]."
2,Didn't do it for me,"I found this book to be kind of an annoying read. Probably because I wasn't a fan of the main character and didn't like how Zigman played out the story. Just left me feeling ""eh."""
3,"The usual quality from NCEs, but a bad misprinting","Norton Critical Editions are almost always among the best scholarly/student editions for literature, and the footnotes and critical content here are no exception. However, at least in my printing (2nd edition), an entire section is printed twice, resulting in three of the stories being incomplete. The double printed content is multiple pages and clips The Kreutzer Sonata, Master and Man, and Father Sergius. Would be perfect except for this printing error, which I have encountered with NCEs before and is my only real complaint with the series. Hopefully this is fixed in later printings."
3,Giro Atomos Racing Helmet,"I purchased over the Bell and found to be pretty comfortable, light but the wind noise is just too much on +18mph riding. Always makes me think a car is approaching, no car, it is the helmet. You would think that this would be a ""design out"" top of the list after safety and comfort, but not my helmet, nope."
5,Fits great/light,no issues at all quick fitting and doesn't budge during rides. also a nice looking design and very well ventilated.
3,The Giro Atmos helmet is a good helmet laminated covering on this one is inferior.,"I already have two Giro Atmos helmets different colors; quality of laminated covering on this one is inferior, not perfect sort of wavy in places. Probably made on a Monday.It is still a good helmet the RocLoc adjustment changed on this model from previous models but for the most part it's the same helmet."
4,JB,"This was the first ""expensive"" bike helmet I ever purchased and I'll probably never purchase a cheaper helmet again. It's a great, lightweight helmet. The size adjuster is easy to use, even when riding. It came with extra padding which I'm sure I'll need by spring time."
5,Light and comfortable helmet,I ride thirty miles several days a week in Florida's high humidity and ninety-degree temperatures. This helmet is perfect for me. It is so light I hardly know I'm wearing it and the vents are big making it probably the coolest helmet I could have. The vents are so big that I apply sunblock to my forehead before a ride. I measured the circumference of my head and followed the sizing chart to choose a size large. It fits very well. The chin strap is very adjustable and comfortable.
5,Best Value,I knew that Giro helmets fit my head well. The perfomance reviews of the Atmos helmet were strong. The Amazon price was best I could find. All I needed to do was adjust the chin straps and twist the head band to fine tune the fit.Great feel. Light weight. Very comfortable. Speedy delivery for Prime customers equals very happy.
3,pretty good but not excellent,"This was a good deal for the price. The keys take a little getting used to since each square button has 2 numbers on it and they rock either up or down to choose. The earphone volume is not quite loud enough (on max), but I may just be a little hard of hearing. The display is typical but I wish the text were larger in many cases, but again maybe my eyes aren't too great either. The ringer is outstanding; you can't miss hearing it. The battery life is really great. Some of the features are a bit cryptic and somewhat hard to find, but they are there and they work well. So it's a very solid 3-star phone with a few 4 or 5 star bits thrown in."
3,Depends on what you're looking for,"This was my first phone. And at first, I loved it. I thought it was the coolest thing. It could light up, take pictures, and make sound recordings. This was a great first phone.However, I've definately outgrown it, but due to certain circumstances in my life, I'm stuck with it. Now the phone seems clunky compared to all those cool sleek phones out there, the image quality is nothing amazing, and it only can hold polyphonic ringtones.Bottom line: I would recommend this phone for parents buying kids their first phone. However, this is by no means a good phone for the experienced cell phone user.** Also, get a deal with Cingular or T-Mobile to get this phone for about $20. By no means pay the price they have in the store and online of $100. Not worth it."
2,Not what I hoped for,"My Nokia 3220 phone is a huge letdown in functionality. First, I bought it for the camera. The camera does not allow me to send pictures. Or my settings, that came with the phone are not sufficient. This is one of the best reasons to have a camera phone. The 2nd unique feature that I was so excited about was the FM radio function. My phone does not have that capability either. Even after sending one back and receiving a brand new phone (exact model as first), no FM function. Now I don't have options but to contact Nokia direct, which I don't think I should have to do with a brand new phone. So I am not impressed with this model and do not recommend it. I was a huge Nokia fan until this phone."
4,nokia review,This cell phone is on of the coolest things that i could have ever had. I like to text alot so this cell phone was the right one for the job. I think anyone who likes to have fun and enjoy texting should like this phone!!
1,A distortion of history,"This book made my blood boil. It distorts history, misstates the law, inaccurately critiques past court decisions in the field of habeas corpus and has an antidemocratic/antifederalism message that conflicts with the Constitution. Freedman's view of the Suspension Clause is contrary to fact and history. This type of expansive view of criminal justice would be more intellectually honest if it would call for the elimination of the states and the federalization of all criminal acts."
3,"Good, not great, could have been better...","This tour of Rome is enjoyable and does a good job of integrating some history and architecture with the key sites. However, the lack of a single useful map (vs. historical maps/illustrations on the front and back inside covers) of the city makes it frustratingly difficult to follow. It is an unfortunate oversight as a simple map with the 7 hills and major buildings would have made it a really useful and more enjoyable book. Because the book is written in the form of a walking tour, it really minimizes the usefulness of the book. Even the identification of the sites that are discussed on a simple map for each section would have gone a long way. If you know Rome well, you may enjoy this book. Don't buy it as an introduction to the city or a guidebook. It is really more of a historical and architectural sketch."
3,for me it was fine,"This book will not be for everyone, but it was for me. I walked (and ran) all over Rome for a week a few months ago with the aid of a useful, but necessarily terse, guidebook. So I know the city superficially, but not very well. McGregor's treatise filled many gaps for me nicely. I wanted to know more about the architecture and history of Rome, and this book did the job. McGregor is strong on his architecture and passable on his history. I did find myself skimming some of the finer architectural points, but I put the blame on my impatience more than on the author, who writes well. I think the book is better read after, rather than before or during a trip to Rome. I found myself turning often to the maps in the back which are coordinated with the text."
3,Acetone-based solvent,"The product description on Amazon doesn't seem to say, but this is an acetone solution, in some sort of thickened gel to keep it in place. It will damage most plastics and paints.I don't know if it works (because I bought it hoping to use it on some plastic toys) but I've used acetone before to remove superglue. I'd say it probably works."
2,"Works as advertised, but bottle almost empty","I bought this to clean up a huge mess I made in my kitchen.Yes, the product works as advertised. It definitely does de-bond superglue, albeit in very small increments. However, the bottle was almost empty when I got it, and the applicator brush was terrible. I ended up buying a different de-bonder, which acted in an identical manner, but offered more several times more product for a similar price.The most important thing, though: My kitchen table looks like new again."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEYI tried on super glue , crazy glue , tried rubbing continuously , tried leaving on for days .It just doesnt work."
3,OK Intro to the Mission for California Fourth-Grader,"We're in the middle of the dreaded fourth-grade California Mission project. I bought this because I really wanted my son to get the most out of the project and thought this would add another dimension. The video is pedestrian -- the narrator literally sounds like she's reading the text for the first time, with difficulty -- but conveys something of what life at this Mission was like. (This is important because, unlike many of the other missions, it was completely destroyed, the replica that's been rebuilt was based on a since-discredited postcard, and the town of San Rafael has grown up around the site, making it impossible to visualize what must have been there 200 years ago.)So -- if your child has difficulty absorbing information from books or if you want to try to round out his/her Mission experience, this is worthwhile. If you're looking for an absorbing, well-made documentary, this is not it."
5,Awesome and Cheap RAM,"If you are considering not buying this because its generic, don't, just buy this, it works perfect in my old Dell and gave a nice boost in speed."
1,no good,"they say it fit good on mi car, but the wires was very short, I can't fit it on mi carwas wrong part"
4,Perfect fit,Is there a warranty on these items? I love Bosch so i will continue to use i enjoyed my o2 senors
5,bosch oxygen sensor,The bosch oxygen sensors installed easily and the price was much less than if purchased at an automotive parts supply store.Very pleased with the product.
4,Oxygen sensor,Fit was good went on easy by following directions. price was better then dealer or auto pat store. I will buy again.
5,works like OEM,"What can i say about an oxygen sensor?It is a Bosch product and it fits like oem, probably was oem. Works fine after the initial fire up, when it stumbled a little while the system relearned the parameters. I replaced all three of them and runs very well. will see if gas mileage goes up. Replaced at 150K miles, just because of age.."
5,Bosch O2 Sensor,"I ordered the sensor and it was just what I expected and needed. Arrived in a timely manner, fit properly, and is working very well."
2,nice looking but smells,"the product smelled like chemicals when i took it out of the box. I aired it out, outside for 2 days and most of it is gone, but it just kind of grosses me out. What the heck is this made of or treated with???? I couldn't imagine putting my child to bed in this right out of the box."
3,Baby didn't like it-- had to make EXTENSIVE modifications,I still use the co-sleeper even though my baby is already over 1 year old but I don't think there is anything special about it attaching to the bed. Just get a bassinet and and stages crib that goes to a toddler bed.
4,No Sensitivity,"I actually havent heard any of the other songs on this cd but I would like to say that No Sensitivity is not only the best song by Jimmy, it is possibly the best song EVER. Words cant describe how awesome this song is. The acoustic guitar solo is amazing. This cd is worth buying just for that song and im sure the other Jimmy songs are awesome too though."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,When i recived this product the top 4 buttons of the remote didn't work the play pause button didn't work and the off button would turn the music off and then turn back on about 5 seconds later. Then when i wanted to get it repaired the manufacturer makes you pay them for shipping to them and another fee so when i was going to return it to the seller I also had to pay shipping and then some other fee.
5,Ihome Ipod clock radio awesome!,"I absolutely love the Ihome Ipod clock radio. The sound quality is so clear, and its size is perfect. I have it on my bathroom counter, and I think it's very cute, too. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
2,Loved it! (before it quit working...),"I bought this for my daughter because it had everything we wanted - in a small package. Not too many out there that play & charge the Ipod, have a radio, alarm, and remote! Up until two weeks ago I would have given this item 7 stars! But suddenly no sound - for the radio or the Ipod. So now what? Still under warrantee (barely!) so I could ship it back to manufacturer but now I'm wondering if the Timex Ti700 is as great as we thought. Will probably do some research to see what else is out there."
3,It's okay,"I bought this because my son has eczema and I know this is a trusted brand. I don't believe it has made the eczema worse, but it hasn't helped like I'd hoped it would. He still breaks out quite a bit after bathing with this. I had better luck with Cetaphil. Still, I find it better than the common brands of baby products. I prefer Cetaphil or the California Baby products, but this comes in third."
1,Texas Mom,"Not only did this product NOT WORK, it also DAMAGED my baby's skin. She has dry and sensitive skin to where other commonly used baby bath washes made her skin dry and patchy. We bought it and used it. After the first use, she was still dry and patchy but I thought it would bring relief. After the second bath ( we bath our baby ever two-three days), this product left her skin so dry and damaged it appeared as though she was sunburnt. It was awful. We switched to Cetaphil cleanser and lotion/cream and she got better. However, it took almost two weeks for her skin to peel and recover. We still use cetaphil and it works wonders."
3,not really helpful for the ISEB exam,I used this book to prepare for the ISEB exam. It is a good overview of testing but not thorough enough to properly prepare you for the exam.
1,Not the best first starter Spanish learning book!,"I found this book not very practical as an introductory book in learning Spanish. It doesn't give you step by step lessons in learning the language. It's all over the place and outdated.I only bought this book, as it was required for my class. As it turned out the teacher wanted us to get a different book because she felt that this one wasn't very good. She was very right! Her reccomendation was for the greatest Spanish learning workbook I have ever come across...Get the book called 'Spanish Verb Tenses' by Dorothy Richmond. I also bought it's partnered book called 'Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions' by the same author. These books are fantastic!!! I have been breazing through them. They are easy to go through and has everything clearly stated and leaves no room for confusion or frustration."
3,Missing pages,"So I was sitting in class and we were asked to turn to page 11, I tried. Pages 11 thru 17 were not to be found,they had been ripped out."
1,So Bad I Couldn't Finish It.,"I find the character of Larry Ellison very interesting but this book is dedicated to bashing him in spite of his success at Oracle. If this were the only fault it would be fine, but as others have said, this is a very poorly written book. Move on..."
2,Ray Lane,Ray Lane is a great business man.Larry Ellison is a bad person.That about sums up this book.Very onesided book. She repeats herself a lot.On the plus side you can learn some of the history about the world's greatest database company.
2,Hinges broke after first use!,"This cooler served us well in terms of keeping food cold for a 3-night camping trip in 2010, but the hinges broke on the last day, making the lid something you have to remove every time the cooler is opened. We are very disappointed in the quality! Everyone using a cooler in the wilderness for days needs to get that lid back on the cooler ASAP. Working hinges are a necessity."
4,Does the job; okay for the price.,"It is what it is. An economical cooler big enough and solid enough for light and medium duty uses. I keep mine in my van for grocery shopping all year-round. In the summer I toss in one or two frozen jugs to help keep my cold stuff cold for the ride home. I don't bother with the blocks in the winter. I would not take this on a rugged outdoor adventure, but for picnics and family camping it should hold up okay."
5,Good Deal,"Used this cooler on a 10 day camping trip. Packed it with meat & fish (several lbs frozen before packing), dairy (2 gal milk, cheese, butter), eggs, and vegetables. Placed a layer of ice on the bottom under the food and covered to fill the cooler. The temperatures reached the mid 90s during the day and low 70s at night. Kept it out of direct sunlight. Added no ice during the whole trip. The water was numbingly cold once the ice melted and the ice on top actually slightly melted and then refroze into a solid icecap about 2 ft long that I lifted out when I unpacked after returning home.Compared to the older cooler used for drinks which took two 7lbs bags of ice every other day (early 90s model metal Coleman), this one worked wonderfully. Ordered a 52 Quart version to replace the old Coleman."
1,I'd look some where else.,"I bought 2 of these coolers and one came in with broken hinges. I never got a reply when I sent out the form to have it replaced. Several weeks after I purchased them, the same cooler was available at Wal Mart for $5.00 less."
3,Will keep items cold for a long time but...,"...The cheap plastic hinges used will not last more than a month of hard wear and the company wants $8.83 for new hinges which again will not last a month of hard wear. I needed a cooler with a hinged lid so once the hinges break, I am forced to pay $8.83 for a new set of cheap plastic hinges. I sent it back."
5,"Good, solid cooler.","Good solid cooler, great price.Definitely not meant for canoeing down the Colorado river or camping in the Rockies....But if you want a good cooler for backyard barbeques or to take to the beach, you need something that will hold a lot of soda or beer, and at that great Amazon price - then this is the cooler for you.Example - July 4th BBQ....one cooler had 10 2 liter bottles of soda, one case water, three bags of ice...other cooler had 12 pack Yuengling, 18 pk Coors Light, three bags ice....could have fit much, much more...coolers are outside in direct sunlight and while the ice is gone, the water is still ice cold....cannot ask for more than that."
3,Good Mash Tun for Home Brewing,"I recently purchased the Coleman Extreme to serve as a mash tun for home brewing. Overall, it's great from a size perspective for 5 (14 pound of grain for example) to 15 gallon batches (well over 30 pounds of grain). The only negative is that the cooler does react negatively to the 150-170 degree heat which results in the the cooler's lid did not have a perfect airtight seal. I needed to tie ropes around the cooler to keep the lid locked down to keep the heat in during mashing. Would recommend to others as it did produce a good mash and the lid is easy to insert fittings for H2O from your hot liquor tank. I also have a bazooka screen which was easy to insert into the cooler's spigot area. Overall, nice buy and would recommend."
4,Nice and functional.,"Large, drains easily and keeps the ice frozen for a few days. I don't think it would last a week unless you use a ridiculous amount of ice, but overall a good large functional cooler. The handles seem plenty strong too, even though I read a review that said they weren't. I think it's a well made product. Not pretty, but it works. Price was fair and cheap shipping too. Thank you Amazon. This was a life saver when my fridge broke. Got it in 2 days."
3,Decent for the price,"I keeps ice for 5 days, in mild temps. it is better than average but not out standing. I would buy again, it is worth the money spent"
3,Ok Cooler,"Nothing is made like it use to be. I like the cooler, worry the handles will not hold up. Good price with free ship so far I am happy with my purchase."
5,Good cooler,"You can't beat the price. I went camping for 6 days, packed this thing with nearly 50 lbs. of ice, and left the cooler in the shade and still had ice on the last day! The high temperature was low 80's, and at night it was high 40's, low 50's. We obviously didn't experience extreme heat, and I did keep it in the shade. But to still have ice after 6 days I was pretty happy. The handles and the hinges don't feel like they're going to last as long as the cooler but none of them do anymore."
5,Great cooler for a Mash Tun,"This cooler makes a great mash tun. I was previously using a Gott 10 gallon cooler, which limited my capacity to less 1.050 beers for the most part. It also required multiple sparges. The coleman 70 Qt Extreme holds more grain and I can brew bigger beers. With it's lager capacity it also only requires 1 sparge, which makes my brew day shorter by about a 1/2 hour. With the extra insulation in this cooler my mash maintained it's temp for over an hour."
5,Keeps it Cool,This kept my food cold for days on a camping trip. It was not above 75 degrees Fahrenheit but it was left in the sun and with 2 bags of ice kept everything cold.
1,Extreme loss of ice....,"I got this cooler and then didn't get a chance to use it for two months, otherwise it would have been returned immediately. The only thing extreme about it is how fast the ice melts. The cooler lid doesn't form a good seal at all. Even in the shade and in 85 degree high temps the ice lasted only 2 days."
3,loose lid,"pure and simple. I fish, i dive, i want a good solid closing cooler. and one that has durable handles and lid clips. hmmmmm..... not here. just got a cooler in a box with a loose fitted lid. hope it holds ice for 4 days. ulua tourney coming up. this was going to be my chilled bait box."
3,Ok cooler,"Some people talked about how this cooler held ice for days, I did not have the same experience and it was only about 85-90 degrees out. In 2 days I went through 50 lbs. of ice so it was just like any other typical cooler to me. I did like the size and price though."
2,Poor Quality,"This is my second one, we will see if it is any better. First one, first day the end panel from behind the handle completely pulled loose exposing the insulation, and allowing the handle to come off the plastic pins."
3,What's with the countoured toe bedding???,"I'm not even sure I am describing it right on the title, but these sandals have indents or islands(?) in between where your toes and the balls of your feet meet. If you don't wear them perfectly (without sliding your foot forward or backward), they rub against one or the other. Kind of irritating. I wish they just made the whole surface flat."
2,Hard on feet and wears out,I have used it for about 4 months. The sole hardly has any give-in. I thought it would get better over the days. It is almost like wearing a plank of wood. So it is not a good one to use it for daily use at home. I tried to use in the gym (swimming pool). The flap that goes over your feet wears out quickly. The blue and white stripes have started peeling off. It is hard to dry them after wearing them in the pool area. Yet to find a good use of these. I now have to find a better pair.
5,Who doesn't love these?,"These have kicked ass since when, the 70's? Still great right out of the box with timeless style. The only plus to adidas with the ""beaded soul"" are when these get wet they are pretty slippery (like most flops) but still my favs of all time."
2,Waste of Money,"These slides look good and fit me okay, but they are PAINFUL because the bottom edge of the band cuts into my toes. Why would anyone make a shoe out of such rigid, sharp-edged material? Obviously not everyone has this issue with the slides, but it could be avoided with a softer band."
5,Just what I wanted!,I had been looking for these for my daughter and couldn't find them until I shopped through Amazon.com! They are exactly what I was looking for.
2,A little disappointed,"I have purchased this type of slider before and never have I had the white strip peel off! It's almost like this slider is a different material then the previous pair I bought. I believe the white strip was painted on. The white strip on my last pair has not peeled away, and they are 3 years old."
3,Interesting but not enough real information,As a chronicle of a mother's courageous struggle to help her lead poisoned twins then this was a great read BUT really didn't provide enough information to be a good resource for anyone looking to understand and treat lead poisoned people
2,"Unbelievably banal, unclever, and uninformative","Why this author would pick this purported topic of tremendous scope and then give us an almost primary-school level rambling and unconnected anectdotal ""history"" instead, with utterly no depth and drawing no significant conclusions whatsoever that I could find, is beyond comprehension. I could detect neither thesis nor heart-beat in this slender tome."
4,A good clean movie,A very good movie. Michael Landon always has movies that are very good to watch for the whole family. I really liked this one.
1,Disappointed,"We remembered watching this on television, and wanted to see it again. We were sorry to hear swearing and to see a scene in an all-man bar,and after watching it this time deciced to throw it in the trash."
4,Great for educators and students,"This is an excellent book for teachers and librarians to share with a group. The pictures are bright and detailed and there is a lot of useful descriptive information. The book could be used to initiate discussion about the natural disasters as well topics in history, geography, and science."
2,Disappointing DVD,"This looks like one of those horrible student films I remember from the 70's. Mediocre acting and writing, a lot of boring interior scenes in L.A. apartments, an implausible trans-sexual, silly sadomasochistic sex, etc. This movie couldn't hold my interest for 20 minutes."
2,Runs a size SMALLER than indicated,"I had to return this shirt since it was way too small but if it had fit it seemed like a decent, light-weight shirt for the money."
1,Do not buy this cd!,"I bought this cd based on a review giving it top score. Unfortunately the tracks here are not original recordings, but studio recordings that lack the energy and flavor of the originals. Even though it does not cost much I would call this cd a waste of money. Go buy ""Salsa Fresca"" or ""I love salsa""/""More I love salsa"" if you want a salsa compilation with good music for dancing."
2,"Good, but derivative","The music is fairly good. But as another reviewer said, it's not the original sound tracks. In fact, it's so derivative that nowhere can you even discover the _name_ of the band that's performing the songs. They appear to list the authors of the music, but nothing about the musicians themselves except that they are ""Various Artists"". That's kind of a clue!"
1,Disappointing.,"This album is not as good as I expected it to be. I certainly wouldn't call it ""best of."" Guess I should have smelled its low quality from that tacky photo on the cover..."
3,La Inocente(1972),"La Inocente(1972) is a campy drama starring Mercedes Carreno and Lilia Michel. Let's get the flaws out of the way. The film is corny and over the top. Mercedes Carreno plays an adult woman with a low IQ and a childlike innocence. Carreno does give a sincere performance as a sensual, simple minded woman. Carreno is famous...or infamous for playing sexy women in Mexican movies. This is like watching Stella Stevens or Barbara Parkins play Nell! Lilia Michel plays Carreno's on screen mother. Michel played a Jorge Negrete fangirl in one of his 1940's films. Maricruz Olivier and Lilia Michel looked similar in 1972! Raul Lavista's music score is very good. It reaches a crescendo in the first three minutes of the film. Sara Garcia and Lorena Velazquez co-star.La Inocente(1972) is a decent film from 1970's Mexico."
2,Limited,"When reading the author's mention of driving to synagogue on Shabbat, or cooking on Friday Nights, a voice at the back of my mind told me that such a thing (breaking the Sabbath) would have been abhorrent to my ancestors and 4,000 years of Jewish tradition. Although the author's Judaism fits very well in the context of contemporary American society, for those of us interested in the Religion of our Forefathers.Readers on a true spiritual search or those looking for something more authentic might be interested in Buber's ""Tales of the Hasidim"" or Heschel's ""An Island in Time"". Though less 'modern', they impart more meaning and relevance."
1,This book is not appropriate for children.,"A small boy in a cowboy outfit takes a train ride at a theme park in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Unfortunately, the entertainment includes letting the boy carry guns (plus ""three real bullet shells""), capture ""bad guys,"" then lasso a ""wild Indian"" complete with tomahawk. The artwork of the Indian is particularly insulting. The historical endnote about the ET&WNC railroad is interesting, but the author and editor used very poor judgement in presenting such negative images in a children's book. The writing style is competent, and I believe the author was capable of presenting a train story that could have been fun without resorting to harmful stereotypes."
3,"Good scratching, okay beats...not for first-time listeners","T-Rock is on the right label: Bomb is ALL about the hip-hop. They've released great DJ records, great beat-box records and the list goes on. T-Rock's effort, however, is just okay.He's a good DJ, make no mistake, but a DJ needs really strong beats and/or ambience to bring out the true character of what it is they're doing. As it stands, the beats fall a little flat about half-way through...it just starts to sound the same. At least it's better than Rob Swift's ""Abilist"" record, so if you liked that, you'll love this.Doesn't even really scratch the essence that is the success of DJ Q-bert or Mix Master Mike's records."
1,Poor quality and even worse customer service.,"I purchased an 805 in 2007. Periodically the video would quit but it always seemed to work ok when I had it checked out but finally it died and has been diagnosed as requiring a new HDMI board only after 400 hrs use. No problem, the board is $98 and is an easy 5 minute plug in installation....but wait, Onkyo won't provide one to the dealer but insists that I take the unit to a service shop 90 miles away and have it installed there at an additional cost of $160. This is simply consumer fraud. I will now toss the unit out and shop for a more reliable, better quality receiver and it certainly won't be Onkyo.Onkyo TX-SR805 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)"
1,I would not buy this product again !!!,"The overheating problem with the SR805 is REAL. It fizzled, sparked and died during the Jacksonville-Pittsburgh playoff game Saturday night. What's worse... I called Onkyo and they said that I will have to take it to an authorized service center. I've only had the thing 10 days and they would not even consider swapping it out. That basically means my 10 day old receiver is now refurbished. Fortunately Electronics Express (seller through Amazon) is going to swap it out for me.Also... I had great ventilation setup. I had a fan blowing across the back and top and had plenty of room on the sides and top.Onkyo's service people don't even seem to care."
4,Onkyo TX-SR805 Receiver. Low priced wonder.,I purchased this receiver a month ago. The performence is wonderful and the unit is very versitile. Onkyo needs to work on its customer service though.JJB
4,Good Receiver,"I am very delighted to have this product. I have one complaint though1) if you use the hidden menu AUX + Power Button and set the processing to 720p. The aspect ratio goes bizzare.Apart from the above. this one is a jewel. i have it hooked up with Polk RM6880, which sounds very good. particularly when connected the Polk Way.I would recommend other who have polk speakers to connect the polk way.ThanksStan"
2,"Great receiver, but...","I purchased 2 Onkyo TX-SR805's from Amazon and had to return both of them. The first would shut off every time the I turned the volume about half way up; the second worked great for about 10 days until my wife went to turn it on one day and sparks flew and scared the s... out of her; needless to say, I no longer own an Onkyo. The sound was great, the price was right, the build quality was missing. Both of them also ran hotter than any other electrical device I have short of a space heater. I had a fan on top of the unit to help with cooling and it did lower the temp by about 20 degrees F. I now own a Pioneer Elite, cost more but I am very happy with it and it has worked for 3 weeks now.Amazon's customer service during these problems was 5 stars except for the times I was obviously hooked up overseas and there was a definite language problem; but even so the people I spoke with could not have been nicer - just had to call back during the day to get my issue resolved."
4,Right unit right on time.,"The TX-SR805 we purchased with the primary focus of THX certification and zoned outputs arrived sooner than expected, and free shipping. The set up did require reading the instruction manual, but the remote control functions slipped seamlessly into our existing component lash-up. The addition of this unit with the satellite receiver dual Digital Video Recorder and wide screen made the High Definition content even more brilliant. The audio zone control will fit snuggly into the whole house audio speaker arrangement. Great buy, just price and right on time."
2,"Nice power, seems like a rush to market","The Onkyo is a substantial receiver with excellent features. The amps and the Audyssey setup is accurate and easy. So what is the hitch? The problem is with the DSPs onboard the 805. For Blu Ray and HD sources (Especially HDMI 1.3a) there is a pronounced and visible lip sink delay. Extremely annoying with HDMI based Blu Ray yet very hard to notice with standard DVDs. Amazon has been slow to refund as well. Looks like customer service has been offshored a bit too far...So keep this in mind, great price (Unbeatable price) yet headaches in your future unless somehow OnkyoCan fix this with a chip swap or drive to the service center.http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=11463542The Yamaha RX-V1800 and the Pioneer Elite X92 (wishing I chose this one first) do not exhibit the issue."
1,"Support from Amazon, Onkyo after 30 days stinks!!!","37 days after I hooked this receiver up guess what happened? It died in a blaze of sparks, flames and white light!! Scared the S*it out of me!!! I contact Amazon telling them I am afraid to have this FIRE HAZZARD in my home and would like to return it, they pawn me off on Onkyo. Guess what there response was?? Only option is to have it repaired!!! So off to the repair center it goes, once I get it back it will be stored in its box where it cant do any damage to my family or me! Waste of $670 bucks!!! AVOID this receiver, do you want to take a chance on it doing more than just burning itself up? I dont!!"
5,Great Value,"Finally slid this beast into my equipment cabinet over the weekend. Other reviews are correct, this thing is heavy (probably 40 lbs) and runs hot. Be sure to leave space for ventilation. Setup was quick, but have the book handy as it was not as intuitive as previous Onkyos that I have owned. Tons of Surround Sound options and of course, THX. I loved the 3 HDMI inputs (I actually didn't use all of them for once) and the HDMI 1.3 support for my Playstation 3. I haven't tweaked my projector yet, but I like the fact that this will support the deep colors of 1.3. I have not seen anything even close to this value in this price range. You would need to spend another $1K to find these features in another brand. If you are even considering spending $500 for a receiver and need to manage your video thru it, I recommend spending the extra $$$ on this unit and future proofing your set up. Two thumbs way up here. No regrets."
5,Great product although burn like crazy,"Well pretty much as the title, when I turn on this receiver, it becomes really hot right away, but so far, there were no trouble.The reason I didn't bought 705 is each channel was 100W only. This one is 130 W and I loved it.It has THX certification, which I loved very much, and devides the sound into 7 speakers very clearly.Each time I insert different DVd or blue-ray disc, it automatically indicates the best sound option which I love too.Above all, comparing to my previous two Yamaha home theater receiver, this one is the best.Two bad things are it's too heavy and makes a lot of heat. But still I am giving 5 stars"
3,already in the shop for repairs,"I had the receiver in for about 2 weeks and I had to send it off for repairs. It never upscaled any image up to 1080p or anything close to it. Additionally, the display didnt work property. I could have all speakers working and only the left and right front speakers were displayed on the receiver.On a positive note, the help line was in fact very helpful.It does get really hot!"
1,blew up,"The sound was great, for 20 minutes then I heard a pop and smoke shot out the top of the unit, what a rip off!!!! Will be returning unit for a different brand."
3,"Great receiver, but quality control issue?","I purchased this receiver in May 2008. Very solid, lots of inputs, great sound. Love having one HDMI running to my television mounted over the fireplace. Runs hot but I keep it on top of my cabinet to allow adequate ventilation. Worked well for about 7 months, now the display no longer comes on. I have heard that this is a problem many owners have had--usually happens about a year after purchase. Trying to get repaired under warranty now."
3,Video is challenging,"I read all the reviews before purchase so I was forwarned of potential difficulty. Love the audio and built in equalizer setup. Even with repeated calls to help desk, I never was able to connect the Video outputs to my Samsung DLP. I was able to see the set up menu on the TV. I tried both HMI and component video connections on the Onkyo before bailing out and using direct component video cables from by Cable Box and DVD player to the TV. I have a Universal 850 RF remote, so the multiple connections are circumvented by macros."
1,Snap Crackle Pop + Plume of smoke,"This receiver sounded great for all of 2hours. I wanted so much to love it, but wasn't meant to be.Watched The Matrix and a little over 2 hours into it, flash, crackle, and plume of smoke. The unit did not feel warm. Ventilation was not an issue, because it was just sitting on the tile floor. Didn't want to put it into the cabinet until I was resonably sure I had a good version, knowing that this receiver has potential heat issue.Thank You Amazon for an pleasant return experience."
4,Great sound for the price,"For less than half the price of a Denon, this receiver provides great sound.Pros: Easy setup. set up new LCD TV, DVD, VCR, Computer within minutes.Unbelievable expandability. Great sound in all listening modes.Cons: Almost too many listening modes. 2 pages of them on the booklet. Had to walk through them all while listening to both pure music and while watching DVDs to try to determine which was best.Little icons that show which speakers are working with what listen modes doesn""t' seem to work. Only shows front speakers working when all the speakers in the 7.1 system are operating. No biggy though. I don't really need to see then on to know the speakers are working.Front panel selection of component is not lit. If you are using the remote no big deal, but if you walk up to the unit to select a component, unless you have a light shinning directing on the face it is hard to see. Would be nice to be back-lit. For the $1500 I saved by not buying the Denon I will live with it."
5,Does the Job-Very well,"This thing is built with quality. The sound is great the upconversion is great and the functionality is great. I have no regrets. I got it the week it came out and have had no problems(for about $1000). The hook-up was very simple. The user interface is not pretty and some of the stuff isn't where you might expect it (in the menus), but once you find it's purely cosmetic. With the price drop I don't think you could go wrong."
2,2 in a row were defective,"Wow. I read up on this receiver and was impressed by the features in this price range. Boy, was I psyched to receive this baby in the mail. It arrived. I let it acclimate to room temperature for over 24 hours. I hooked it up. It died after 1 hour. Wouldn't even power on. I figured I must have gotten a bum receiver and opted to exchange. Amazon was very fast in getting the second unit to me. It arrived. I let it acclimate to room temperature for over 24 hours. I hooked it up. 2 of the 3 hdmi inputs were shorted out and this thing wouldn't even recognize that speakers had been hooked up to it. I sent it back. I will take my refund and remain sated with my aging, yet functioning, Pioneer receiver. Hooray for brick and mortar stores and in-store demo'ing. Boo for buying online."
1,Still Waiting,"After about 1 week, it lit on fire and stopped working. I returned it with free return shipping (Thank You!!). I told the person at your Warehouse that I would prefer a new one and was told they were out of stock. They would not give me any idea on when they would be getting more in and that they would return the cost to my credit card. Still waiting on confirmation of my returned funds so I could purchase another from a different vendor. I would still prefer another unit!"
2,"Some good action, but a week story line","I have always liked the authors books, but since the end of the cold war it seems the plots have been getting more manufactured and lack believability. This novel is the worst example so far of this tendancy. The idea of the Idaho National Guard taking on the regular army is ludicrous. Dispite these issues there are a number of well written action scenes."
2,what happened?,"The best military author I have ever read, now is recycling ideas promoted in other stories into this book. Original ideas are lacking throughout. His fear that the Civil War books would hurt him was proven unfounded. . It didn't-- the last two books have."
5,a great book to add to your collection of staw wars guides.,"This book has hundreds of characters from the Star Wars universe. It has characters from each of the comic books, books, movies, and spin-offs. It's a definite must-see."
4,Good Book - could use updating tho,"If you're mega into SW then this book is for you.Each character reviewed gets at least a page of text, with info and background. Major chars (ex: Luke, Leia, Vader) get several pages chockful of info info info!* However, it needs some updating, since stuff has happened since '95. But a great source for fans anyway. ^_^"
2,One Word: OBSOLETE,"Don't commit the same mistake I did by buying this book if you already own the Essential Chronology or the Essential Guide to Alien Species.This book needs an URGENT update, there are no refences for Corran Horn nor Kyle Katarn even if this last one had appeared BEFORE the book's publishing.The illustrations are equally obsolete: Borsk Fey'Lya is portrayed with the ""dwarfish"" look the bothans had in previous comics (even the book has illustrations of Thrawn taken from the comic adaptation of Heir to the Empire in which the bothans have the modern goat face they exhibit in the Guide for Alien Species!)"
4,It's ok,"A little outdated but it's a great reading. The book is from 1999, so it's missing what happened in the last decade about the Star wars Universe."
2,I also agree with obselete.,This book has some useful references but for the most part it is in dire need of some updating. With the release of the new movies this just doesnt cut it as a reference guide anymore. This is the worst of the essential star wars guides.
2,I agree with the obselete guy,With the release of episode 2 this books information is rendered pretty much obselete. There is alot of incorrect information here. For example Owen Lars is noted as being Obi wan's brother.I'm sure that the author worked with what he had but the bottom line is its just not reliable reference material.
5,THIS BOOK SHOULD BE UPDATED,"Since many STAR WARS stories have been written since 1995, this book should be updated. Some stories from 1995, which have been excluded from this book, are THE MIXED-UP DROID (came with square comic book) and all of Roger MacBride Allen's CORRELLIAN TRILLOGY books (in which General Crix Madine had died). Besides, it only covers the first 2 YOUNG JEDI KNIGHTS stories, HEIRS TO THE FORCE & SHADOW ACADEMY"
1,IMac Dual Core owners take note!,"I'm not sure this product deserves a ""one star"" rating because I was never able to use it. Since none of what came with my new computer mentioned the built-in firewall, I thought I needed one. Wrong. After trying to install the program with no success, I finally checked Symantec's website and found the problem. Amazon won't refund opened software but Symantec will for this problem. Still waiting for my refund....."
3,"Clegg, Neverland","Neverland is the first book I've read by Douglas Clegg. The novel is about two cousinsdoing things in secret in a shack they call Neverland. Whenever they go inside, Sumpter,the cousin of the protagonist, performs strange acts like bringing a dead rabbitback to life or sacrificing a kitten to what he calls Lucy. The novel is very brutallyinteresting and its one of those books like Boy's Life by Robert R. McCammon or Itby Stephen King where a lot of the story is made up by kids just being kids. I caredmore about the kids doing regular things like climbing up a roller coaster or stealingtheir first beer more than the supernatural quality of the book. I am definitelygoing to read more books by Clegg in the future, but this book didn't have the powerto make me go on a rampage to find and read everything by him right after finishingit. So far, Koontz, King, and Laymon are the only authors who have done that forme."
1,Disappointing,"After reading all the reviews I thought I would be in for a wonderfully creepy horror story. I do not think I could have been more disapointed. Never once was I creeped out. Mostly I was bored. There were some good elements and I think this story had a lot of potential. Too bad it fell short. Way short. There were too many thing I found absurd. Even suspending disbelief for a supernatural horror story, it was absurd. What a waste of time."
3,It's OK,"This book feels more like it's about family secrets, destructive family dynamics, and alcoholism.I felt no real interest in the characters, despite how extensievly we're shown them. But they are, at least, believable. You're promised something dark and evil, but it's only eerie and creepy. Even at its culmination, it doesn't feel as significant or big or all that impressive at all. More like horror for children.Have you read Harrow House by Clegg? This feels like that, but in a different setting, with a different implication.It's not a bad exercise, just underwhelming."
3,A good way to pass time,"This book is paced well and will not disappoint you if your goal is to read through a weekend, however it is not one that you 'have' to finish in one night. It was not particularly scary or suspenseful (except for a few tense scenes), however it was entertaining enough to keep me from putting it down. I have not read the print version, however the Kindle version did not seem to have any issues with spelling/grammer/etc. and includes a few illustrations."
4,"Good read, and a page turner to the end","The book is a real page turner. The last hundred or so pages flew by and I found myself trying to find extra reasons to read the rest. The story is good and the plot carries well. The writing itself is similar to early Stephen King. Not as good, but similar. For me, the true test of a book is how well it pulls me in and makes me want to read it. This one did that well, so it gets a good 4 star review. It's worth the once over if you're considering it at all.You can read a full review here: [...]"
2,Not what it was cracked up to be,"I don't know if this was old, and so the smell altered, but I couldn't wear it. It smelled like a cross between your grandma's perfume and insecticide. I gave it away. Maybe on others the chemistry would be different. The lady I gave it to said she loved it, but I don't know if that was sincere.Gave it 2 stars because of the brand, and because my friend said she liked it."
3,The Thin Blue Line !,This is a pretty good game. It follows all your favorite people and along the same time line as the series. It offers good action such as shoot outs with bad guys and three different weapons you pick up along the way. You get bust guys and search them for guns and drugs and eithier keep them for retirement or turn them in as a good cop if you feel like it or need to take the heat off you in the game. It not the most over the top game there is but it should offer any player a pretty good challenge. For what it is I was surprised.This game is a least worth checking out plus the price is right I say go for it.
1,Really disappointing,"There should have been a lot more to this game. There is no free roaming capability. You do not drive a car once in the whole game. It simply goes from one mission to the next, where you beat or shoot a bunch of dudes, sneak past a couple dudes and then slap answers out of a main dude. With games like True Crime: New York and even The Getaway as a guide this game could have been really good. As it is if you are a huge The Shield fan it is slightly entertaining but on its merit as a video game it is horrible and a ripoff for anyone who purchases it."
2,It could be better...,It could have been a lot better. I finished it without cheat codes in a day or so and then it sat on the shelf until I traded my PS2 in for a PSP.
4,"What side is the ""right"" side.",I really like this paper and it prints well! BUT....the instructions say to print on the whitest side. Well....both sides appear to be the same even under different lighting. The only difference is in texture and that is very slight. I will buy this paper again.
4,Printing,"I bought this paper based on other artists using it to sell prints on etsy.The paper is very pricey and very difficult to figure out what side to print.The directions state to print on the brightest (whitest) side. I can not figure out what side is the whitest!Epson needs to mark this paper somehow, this is my biggest issue.I finally printed my first print to sell on etsy. Not sure if the right side was selected???But, very impressed with the results! The detail is Fantastic!Good luck to you if you decide to take a chance with this paper."
4,Great paper!,"Paper is perfect size for test prints or for the small print enthusiast. Texture is evident enough in the print to make aware of the paper as rag, but not obstructing to the printed image. I personally print black and white and the images print out really rich and beautiful. Love this paper."
1,review of Epson Velvet Fine Art Papaer,"I am very disappointed with this paper. From the title it sounds like it should produce very black, ""velvet like"" blacks. But instead it prints like a flat matt surface paper. It also sticks in the Epson 2200 printer because it is thick. It should be described as a matte surface paper."
5,Beautiful,"I bought this paper to make prints of my work to sell at an art show. The quality of the paper is wonderful. It makes my prints look like they are done on watercolor paper, but the quality is much better."
2,annoying sidekick,"I agree with the previous reviews--Zak Lee is charming enough, and the cardio section, which is only 20 minutes, provides a fairly decent workout that I might do on an easy day. But Ellen K. is the most annoying, wretched person I've seen on any kickboxing aerobic video to date (I've got a dozen). What in the world were the producers thinking? Also, the 10 ""rounds"" really aren't rounds...no consistency in the workout. Not worth the money when there are so many other competent videos out there. Zak Lee should try doing another one, more organized and without annoying bimbos."
1,Pass this one up,"I was VERY disappointed with this video. The main reasons...Zak Lee's lack of experience as a fitness instructor, a useless and annoying chick named Ellen K (who performs several movements wrong and talks entirely too much), and a strange format called ""Rounds"" that accomplishes nothing more than dragging out what little workout there is. The only part of the video I did like was the dance-like, choreographed segment which is strictly for your entertainment. Invest in something else."
5,Classic Piers Anthony Xanth,"Just as with all his other Xanth novels, Piers Anthony gets a 100% from me!!"
2,Anthony should have left it alone,"I have been enthusiatic about the Xanth series for about five years now. I really enjoyed all the earlier books, but this one is just not good. The puns are front loaded into the book and not nearly as funny as usual and I don't care for the preteen girl characters much either. In one part he has them trying on panties forever. It's somewhere between boring, bizarre, and perverted."
2,uggg waste of time,I dont know how to rate this book cause every copy i got was MISPRINTED! Amazon has been so un helpfulness resolving this issue. So fed up. Guess I wasnt meant to read this one :(
3,Good cable,"I've used many tripp lite products in the past, from data center UPS to this fiber optic cable. I was happy with the build quality of the cable itself, and it has been in use to extend my corporate backbone for two months now."
5,Best Ambience recording of all time!,"Ever want to get the feel of hearing a folk-music musician of the bleeker street kind from the 60's? Although this wasn't recorded in the 60s this is certainly a 60's artist of the folk genre. Very entertaining, intimate, poignant stories between songs or shall we say spontanous chatter which seems to be too clever to be spontanous but let's say it is anyway. I highly recommend this CD if you can get a copy of it. I think I bought the last copy available, so this review is almost needless?"
4,Perfect Fit,One hit wonders this o2 sensor didn't last to long my light is back on again for the same sensor Bosch really disappointed me this time but then again the part could have been bad?
5,Perfect replacement,Worked great for my 97 expedition 5.4 Eddie Bauer . Would like to thank buyer for fast shipment and great product
4,"Bosch 15716 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment","Sensor works good. The ears on the plug are off so either you have to cut them down or splice in the old plug. Got the sensor on time.Bosch 15716 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment"
5,Facing Life and Death Decisions,"When Is It Right to Die?: Suicide, Euthanasia, Suffering, MercyBought this book when caring for my mom who was confined to a bed, unable to do anything for herself and could not communicate. This book helped answer some hard questions....good."
5,Excellent research.,I am enjoying reading this book and am amazed at the depth of research that went into this book.
2,Finally,The product showed up almost a month late. I hope American Wholesale does better in the future. Hopefully I will not need to use this but I wanted it to be a part of my emergency supplies.
3,Order this and they send you Dentek because Temparin was bought out by them.,Kind of chalky. Lasts 1 - 2 days only. Okay if your seeing your dentist soon.I expected a harder substance.
3,Temparing Filling. Not as good as I thought!,It didn't work as I thought.It removes easy or maybe I don't know how to use it.Thank you any way!
4,Doesnt really work.,"I used this for my crown that popped out. Doesnt really hold. Perhaps for a few hours tops. Sometimes just talking or creating internal pressure in my mouth can loosen the crown. This is the new type, not the same as the one pictured.UPDATE:Works for 12 hrs plus if you let it set the right way. I found out you must not talk or open your mouth for a good 2-3 hours once you put the paste in and put it in your mouth. What I was doing was sleeping with the crown, or putting it in the daytime and talking with it. Keep your mouth closed and shut tight for a few hours and its actually a good dental paste. Havent tried eating on it yet however, don't want to test the limit."
2,Disappointed.,"I was expecting all of the verses to the traditional Jingle Bells. Instead, after the first verse, there were a bunch of made up verses about different countries with moderate success at rhyming and rhythm. Illustrations are average bordering on stereotypes. Italian grandma (la Belfana) with hooked nose and wart? Really?"
5,How Christmas is celebrated in some parts of the world,"Iza Trapani expands a well-loved Christmas song and in the process takes readers on a wonder-filled sleigh ride through different countries such as Kenya, Italy, Sweden, Poland, the Philippines and of course the US, showing us how Christmas is celebrated in these countries in vivid color and cheerful illustrations.I'd recommend all of Ms Trapani's books as they make for wonderful reading aloud as well as sing-alongs."
4,A lovely book every mother and daughter should read!,This is the first book I've read of Amy Tan. I thought it was a great book. It was full of description of the setting and the time-period. I thought that this book was a good portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship. The creative characters were easy to relate to. Tan weaves the characters thoughts and feeling into the story of their past. I think that everyone should read this book.
5,Yum,"For me, Amy Tan's books are a rare and special treat that you only get every few years. I savor each one like a rich, creamy truffle."
4,"Good, but not fantastic","First, let me say it was a great book. Loved it. But from Amy, I guess I expected more. Or maybe I was expecting to much. I just know it could have been better.In some ways, its like Amy works down a checklist when writing. ""Lets see... American boyfriend... check! Strained mother-daughter/family relationships... check! Nonlinear plot... check! A disease / disorder to make the characters more interesting... check!""OK, I know that sounds kind of harsh, but i digress.The book was very enjoyable, but the only thing that irked me was the last couple chapters. Its like she was typing and said ""Oh no. I only have 50 pages to close this puppy up and get it to the publisher."" Everything just clicked into place, and while it works in her other books, to me it just seemed, well, forced.Nonetheless, I'll probably end up reading it again to catch any of the little things I missed the first time. I just think that, with her talent, it could have turned out a little better."
2,Same old same old,"Up to now all Amy Tan's novels have followed the same formula:(1) Mother fled to the US from China around 1949 when the communists took over.(2) Daughter raised in America hates Chinese culture and mom's superstitions.(3) Mother and daughter did not get along or understand one another.(4) Mother reveals all secrets left behind in China when nearing the end of her life.(5) Mother and daughter thus make up and daughter comes to appreciate her Chinese heritage.Reading one of those books is Okay, but two or more is just too much! Please! Show some fresh ideas here!Also for those of you who are fascinated but unfamiliar with China, do take it as a drama instead of could-be real life story. The book feels to me more like Chinese food in America - Americanized to be appealing to the general audience - If you want authentic taste, go read some original Chinese works and meet some real Chinese people!"
5,Bringing the Past into the Present,I found Amy Tan to have a very intimate writing style -- in the sense that I felt like she was recording my thoughts and emotions. The relationships she builds in this book have been experienced by most and she captures it in a way that makes you wonder how you didn't see/realize it before. The stories of the ancestors make the book even more intriguing by revealing ancient customs and traditions that tend to bleed into the new age. The melding of the two times shows you the product of the present. Kudos to Ms. Tan for a very enjoyable read.
4,I loved this book!,"All of the above reviews are right on - I agree except for the fact that it starts off a bit slow. Stick with it and you will be so glad you did. I felt extremely empowered once I finished it, it's a must have!"
3,Not Amy's best,"I just read ""The Bonesetter's Daughter"" because I was waiting for a new Amy Tan novel. This is a story about how a daughter learns to love and appreciate her elderly mother more as she comes to know her life story through tales of the past in tiny villages in China at the turn of the century. To me, the Joy Luck Club and the Kitchen God's wife are still the best. This one had some elements of both but didn't capture the interest quite as well, story not quite as believable, major characters too extreme."
4,Unveiling greatness too well hidden,"Tan weaves a vast tale of family secrets revealed, in which people seem to hide all that is best in themselves. The secrecy impoverishes their relationships, till the truth comes to light and exposes their authentic greatness. All their suffering, struggling, even their soul-murdering resentment of each other, then comes together in a coherent pattern of beauty that's almost too good to be true. Maybe the ending is a bit too happy. But Tan is not one to deny the ultimate human dream. And the path to that ending is so real, so gritty, at times so heart-poundingly gripping, that all the happiness is richly deserved.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"
4,"A great book--entertaining, emotional, authentic","I can't say enough good things about this book. It's a beautifully crafted and dramatically conceived novel that compares two generations, contrasts the immigrant experience with the experience of the native born, and explores the traditional and changing roles of women in China and in the United States. This is simply a great story and it never lags or bores you. I zipped through it quickly, and I look forward to re-reading it again in the near future."
4,Captured the culture/ethnic details,"The one-star reviews are accurate and I agree with their criticism.However, surely we know that Amy Tan is not writing anthropological, or sociological material for academic research nor for intellectual inquiry. She's writing novels to entertain and to MAKE MONEY. Her genre is no more, or less worthy than espionage thrillers, medical thrillers, forensic thrillers,... or any other type of novel. She has a formula that works so it makes sense to keep using it!Amy Tan's books are faithful renditions of the Asian propensity for tragedy, managing relationships, victim of global events, self-sacrifice,... She paints characters with the right gestures, accents, behaviors and beliefs.If you like cultural/social details, accurately described but in an entertaining way, do read Tony Hillerman's many books about modern Navajo culture.The Shape Shifter"
4,I loved it!!!,"The growth in the lifetime of a mother-daughter relationship seems endless. Ms.Tan always captures the reality of the loves and the hates between mother and daughter, the cultural differnces, and the tug of war between the two with delicacy and humor which makes her books that much more enjoyable."
2,I was disappointed,"I love Amy Tan's first 3 books. This book, however, was a major disappointment. I don't know why she chose to switch from her beautiful first - person style to third person? The book seemed to have lost a lot of the Amy Tan's special charm and was a lot less beautiful, interesting, and profound than the first 3 books. I think this may have something to do with her switching to a new editor."
3,An Window into the Chinese World.,"I like that Amy Tan depicts an America through a outside viewpoint. All of her books serve as a quasi-history lesson for me. I've learned so much about Chinese culture and history just from reading her books. Though all of her stories tell of mother/daughter relationships, they are not one dimensional. Tan gives her readers a multifaceted view of the world. Every mother/daughter relationship is not the same, but most of us can find something in her stories that we relate to. her writing helps validate the lives of so many people, people who'd probably not have their voices heard in mainstream America. I applaud her efforts and look forward to another dose of Chinese/American soulfood."
1,"Terrible writing style, boring story","The members of our bookclub recently read this book and unanimously agreed that it was a waste of time and money. Amy Tan's writing style is uninspiring; she writes very matter of factly, leaving no room for imagination to the readers. The story line, as many other reviewers here have commented, is poor. If you are looking for interesting and well written novels on China, try 'Wild Swans; Three daughters of China' by Jung Chang, or an older classic 'The good earth' by Pearl S. Buck."
2,Disappointing,"I've been an Amy Tan fan since ""The Joy Luck Club"". But this book appears to be written by someone who's trying (poorly) to copy Amy's style. I was sorely disappointed; the book was ""choppy"" in its presentation, and I was put off by the incorporation of Ruth's mother's story smack dab in the middle of the book. If this were the first Amy Tan book I read, I would never buy more."
5,A finely wrought novel,"I think this is Amy Tan's best novel. The middle section about the life of the protagonist's mother in China is outstanding, and vivid, and heart-rending. The treatment of girls and women in China was brutal and sad, and continues to this day. (See Karin Evans' The Lost Daughters of China, Penguin Putnam 2000)."
5,It's the Mother/Daughter Thing...,"Amy Tan is such a great writer, and the way she examines the mother/daughter relationship is extraordinary and honest. The Bonesetter's Daughter tells so many stories about Chinese culture, family relationships, stepfamilies, superstitions, love, triumph, growing up, the past, ancestors, knowing ourselves, knowing our family, family curses, and breaking family curses.I was actually envious of Ruth not being able to talk for a whole week each year. The story of Ruth's grandmother is absolutely wonderful and sad. The book left me with hope for Ruth and her mother. Their lives are not cursed by some unhappy ghost and a passing curse from an evil man.The story is wonderful and well written. It's a must read for Amy Tan fans and people who love mother/daughter stories."
4,These are the things I must not forget...,"So begins a packet, written in Chinese, that Ruth finds hidden in her mother's secret floorboard. Ruth has been having trouble recently, in attempting to deal with issues ranging from her American boyfriend, stepdaughters, career and her mother's increasing forgetfullness. When her mother is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Ruth realizes that it is time to put her life and family together.Ruth has the packet translated, and discovers her mother's history. These are things she never knew, but which help her understand her mother's feelings and emotions. Her mother's history is undeniably tragic, yet strangely provides hope for both mother and daughter.Tan has succeeded again with a compelling story of the bonds that tie mothers and daughters, especially those with cultural differences."
2,"same story, different character names","This is Joy Luck Club all over again, but less interesting because it follows the stories of fewer characters.The happy ending is pathetically contrived and sudden. The protagonist's boyfriend and his daughters are so unappealing in the first half of the book, it's very jarring to have that turned upside down so suddenly.This can be an enjoyable read, but don't expect anything new."
3,Nothing new in Tan-Land,"Let me first start by saying I truely enjoy Amy Tan's work. When I heard about the release of this book I was first at the bookstore to get it. Upon reading it it is clear that Amy Tan is running out of original ideas. Reading this book you almost feel as if you are reading Kitchen God's Wife. All her books seem to center around the same themes of women in China who rise above their situation and make it to America where they reflect back upon their lives. If you took all the covers from the Amy Tan books off, closed your eyes and put any cover on any book, you would pretty much still be reading the same story. The books read the same, only the titles are changed."
4,Mothers and Daughters,"It took me a while to finally read Amy Tan and so glad I picked this one to start with.I really like history so was facinated with the story of Ruth's mother when she refelected on her story back in China.I really related in a way with this story because my mother has Altzheimer's and so made me reflective when Ruth finally came to terms with her mother's illness.I loved the way Ruth grew in this book and came to terms with herself and her mother when she found out who she was through her mother's writings and the real story of her background.The characters were real like her aunt (what a character)and Auntie Precious who she found out to be related too, but I won't tell what relation in case someone hasn't read the book.Forgiveness, coming to terms with life, and finding out who you really are will be the things you will experience when you read this book.Enjoy this book, I did!"
2,Disapointed big time,"Having enjoyed Amy Tan's previous books I was looking forward to a rich, enjoyable read. However, I find myself struggling at the halfway point with this book. I simply find that I don't care much for any of the characters or their problems. I would have been better off re-reading ""The Joy Luck Club""."
2,"Beginning good, middle ok, towards end bore me","All of Amy Tan's book are the same: mother-daughter conflict and reminscing the past in China.I enjoyed the beginning to middle VERY MUCH, but when it got towards the middle-end to end, I wasn't too interested in it anymore. I wanted to stop reading it, but I had to find out what happened, so I skipped a few pages and went right to the end.I thought this book would focus a lot on her mother's illness, but it was more about her childhood. It remind me very much of Adeline Yen Mah's ""Chinese Cinderella"" or ""Falling Leaves."" (""Chinese Cinderella"" is a good book by the way.)I feel the flashbacks could've been cut short. I feel the ending could be better too. If you want to read a good novel with Alzheimer's in the story, read Nicholas Sparks' ""The Notebook."" Beautiful book."
2,Wordy Amy Tan,"Alright...I loved Joy Luck Club, I struggled through Kitchen God's Wife, but this was really really tough. I mean Ms. Tan is pretty wordy in this book. She goes on and on about Ruth, this disrespected self made victim. The psychology of this book in unreal. There is so much unexplained symbolism that your head is spinning trying to figure out where she is going with it. In my opion Ruth should not have been the focus of this story because frankly she is boring. I am reading this book as part of a a book club (my pick because I loved Joy Luck) but now the ladies in the club are sending me hate mail, because they can't get past the first few chapters (Some have described it as painful).No disrespect to the greats but this ain't no joy luck (Sorry Amy Tan)"
1,How much for a Kindle edition????,"I like Amy Tan's books. But why would I pay so much for a Kindle addition when in truth, most of her books can now be found in remainders bins for $6.00 or less. Is this Amy Tan's, or her editor's, way of expressing their displeasure with e-books? If I read any more Amy Tan it will be in a free print copy from my local library."
4,Mother and daughter find a common thread.,"I found ""The Bonesetter's Daughter"" to be a very touching story of a mother and daughter united by their shared past. Realizing that the time will come when her mother is no longer with her, Ruth attaches a new importance to her family history, and learns about the roots of her Chinese heritage. The most interesting part of the book was the way in which the author alternated between the present tense and the past. The story relates to a Chinese family, but it is a universal theme that would just as easily apply to a family from England, Russia, Israel, etc. I would recommend this book to anyone of any heritage, but especially to anyone who is particularly interested in discovering their own roots."
4,A story from the heart.,"I just heard Amy Tan speak at a conference this weekend, and I can't say enough about this articulate, funny and spiritual writer. In Bonesetter's Daughter, she dealves even deeper into her oftentimes troubled relationship with her mother and the overwhelming tragic influence of her Chinese past on her family. An important exploration into the women's experiences in China, it is also a study of human emotion and its heritage for future generations. Amy Tam began this book at her mother's exhortions to tell her ""true story"". In the aftermath of her experiences in the last moments of her mother's life, Amy Tam revised the whole focus. A true story of the heart."
3,Something is missing.,"Although this novel has elements of a great story, including good writing, good story and characters you grow to love and care about, there was just something missing. A good editor, maybe?The story begins with Ruth, a 40-something ghost writer whose love life is less than perfect, and whose mother is showing signs of Alzheimer's Disease. Mother-daughter conflicts and painful memories on both sides have their roots in long-buried family secrets. Until the secrets of the past are unearthed, neither woman is able to love herself or others fully. The story really slows down in the middle, when the mother relives her childhood in China, and reading it becomes more like homework than pleasure.Buy the paperback, or better yet, check it out of the library."
3,Good But Not Great,I've been waiting for the next Amy Tan book but The Bonesetter's Daughter was a bit of a disappointment. I believe wholeheartedly that Tan is a great contemporary writer. This just wasn't worth the wait. Maybe I'm measuring it by the previous novels but it lacked the sparkle and engrossing story of her former books. It moved slowly for me.
4,daily life intertwined with fantastic....things!,"I'm not the best at reveiws, but i know that I read this book in 4 days- amazing for a working college student! I could barely put it down. it involved simple daily life, but it wasn't dull. The history of the families in this book were fascinating and touching, all mysteris came into place. I like reading asian-american literature and would recommend it, better then joy luck club i think"
2,Am I the only one to not enjoy this book?,"After reading some of the positive reviews of this book, I wonder if I missed something. I loved Tan's other books; salivated for Chinese food while reading them. But half way through this one, I returned it to the library. The prose was lacking its usual charm, and I found the setting and characters to be flat."
3,oh no...more same old stuff..,"I bought every book of hers but this probably will be the last time I'd pay for her book. Amy Tan has very good writing techniques but all her books since The Kitchen God's Wife (by the way is my favorite) all read the same and it gets tiresome after a while, no matter how well the book was written.And to be honest, I've never quite totally understood all the ghostly and superstitious things in her books. Being a Chinese grew up in Asia, I felt she wrote those Asian cultural elements like stereotyped dishes in a bad Chinese-American restaurant -- sounded Chinese but tasted more like American.I really wish she would write something totally different and refreshing next time."
4,Memoirs of the Past,"Amy Tan created a brilliant novel with realistic characters and an engaging plot. The Bonesetters daughter follows present day, Ruth as she struggles in her relationships with Art, her significant other; her mother, LuLing; and most importantly, herself.Luling is a very traditional Chinese woman who is living with a dreadful past of her own. Luling struggles to identify with her daughter Ruth. As Luling is developing dementia she decides to record her history on paper as her mother did for her. Ruth dismissed the memoir until many years later when she had it translated and discovered her mother's past as well as her grandmother's (Precious Auntie) past. Through this memoir, Ruth discovered the truth about the women in her family and the truth for herself.Amy Tan created very strong women and their journey and trials will attest to their nature of survival. The Bonesetters Daughter was by far one of the best books that I have encountered."
4,"Magical, mythical and compelling.","Amy Tan has again brought us into her world and culture. This is the story of an Asian daughter who has long since settled in the USA and her relationship with her Americanized daughter who has never seemed to understand the woman within her mother. It is only after Ruth reads her mothers life story, which has been written down for posterity, that she begins to see the great struggles and difficult life her mother has survived.The story is written with a magical hand and reads like a myth to be passed on and treasured by the family that follows. There are many surprises for Ruth along the way as she continues on her trek, unveiling the source of much that has comes to pass.This is a wonderful book. I was able to listen to it as a book on tape and was highly entertained by the intonation of the voices and accents which made it so real. An excellent choice, I would give this book 4.5 stars. Kelsana 8/17/01"
3,Adeline Falling Star,"Adeline Falling Star was a really good book; it kept you wanting to read more. This book is about a girl that was biracial; she was half Indian and half white American. That was very hard for her. She was treated badly and didn't get any respect. When her father, Kit Carson, a famous explorer and guide, went away from home to work she was left with her aunt and uncle. They didn't approve of her race. They treated her like a slave. Adeline had to do something about it. So, she did. This book was intriguing, and showed you that you can do something about your problems. Adeline was courageous and persevered. Finally, she got what she wanted most in life, her father."
1,I had enough of Tan!,I was hoping since the Joy Luck Club that she would get her history right about the portrayals of Chinese. She hasn't. To show proof: Tan claims that the God of Mercy listens only to women. This isn't true. Tan will do anything to gain white acceptance. Even deliberately misrepresening Chinese culture.
4,interesting,"I really liked the book. It was interesting, especailly the mother's story. I can't wait for a new book by Amy Tan. It will probably take for ever. Hurry up , please. We are waiting."
2,Disappointing,"Having read Tan's other books, I was looking forward to reading this one. I was disappointed. The Bonesetter's Daughter is dull and not nearly as good as The Joy Luck Club or The Kitchen God's Wife. Read those instead."
2,A Big Mistake in the Book--what's an oracle bone,"The oracle bone and the bones of Peking men are not the same. The former was locater in Anyang, Hunan Province, and the later was discovered in Zhoukoudian, as the book calls, the Mouth of the Mountain. It's a pity that Amy Tan made such a big mistake in her fourth book."
3,Let's be honest!,"The first section was boring. I'm not Asian but I agree with a reader from New York. Amy has to change her characters and find another way to develop the story. The middle section was ok. But never was it a book that couldn't be put down. Time needs to be taken to consider the plot of your next book, Amy, and think, have you said it before? do we need to hear again the struggle of a relationship between an Asian woman and a lackluster ""American "" male. A reader from Michigan"
4,No disapointment from this Tan Fan,"Tan's ability to bring the reader in to the character portrayal of Mother Vs. Daughter is amazing. Surely this is a theme that she enjoys writing about and it's obviously a non-wasted talent for her to do so. By the end of the novel, I found myself caring deeply for Lu Ling and mourning her loss of memory through Alzheimer's, concerned for Ruth in her quest to find ""Precious Auntie's"" real name, as well as despair for Precious Auntie and her eventual tragic fate in the family history. This, my second Amy Tan novel, did not leave me disappointed."
3,Book: The Boneseter's Daughter,The condition of the book was a little rough. I am comparing this to other books I have purchased iwth the same rating. The book is self is one I would recommned for reading.
5,A beautifully cultural story of mother-daughter connections!,"Although I am familiar with Amy Tan's work after seeing and enjoying the movie adaptation of THE JOY LUCK CLUB, this is the first time I actually read one of her novels, and it is definitely on my personal Top 10 List for 2002!Amy Tan is an expert at portraying the complex relationship between mother and daughter from generation to generation. She also describes Chinese culture and traditions in a way that we rarely read about in literature. Her writing is so beautifully intriguing that I read her children's story, THE CHINESE SIAMESE CAT (PBS's Sagwa is based on this story), to my daughter last night and I found it equally compelling. Amy Tan has the ability to convey Chinese culture and traditions to every generation and I hope to read more of her work!"
4,all mothers and daughters should read this,"This book explores the mother daughter relationship we all face. It eloquently explores the issues involved including how we are raised and how we take care of our parents. In addition, Amy Tan once again weaves a terrific story to her exploration of the relationship."
5,Tan's works capture Chinese heritage,"After reading The Joy Luck Club, I was certain no other book written by Amy Tan could rival. I was wrong; The Bonesetter's Daughter was a thorough and very enticing read. The book chronicled the lives of two people- Ruth and her mother, Lu Ling. The two had a shaky relationship ever since Ruth was a little girl. After discovering many aspects about LuLing's life, the reader gains a more clear knowledge of LuLing's behaviour and understands how she acts with Ruth. The story was very touching, with many sad things happening to both characters. This story, like Joy Luck Club, offers much insight into Chinese cultures and customs; it also shows the loss of identity that comes along with trying to adopt an American identity on top of another culture."
3,Good read!,"While this isn't up to par with her other novels, in my opinion, this is excellent Tan. Obviously, this story is very near and dear to her heart and it shows. The story is very touching, although I did not feel quite as drawn to these characters as I have those in her previous novels. Still, it's hard not to like something written by Amy Tan."
4,loved it,"I bought the saving fish from drowning book after hearing an interview by amy tan. It was capitvating! I couldn't wait to read more. This got me hook on amy tan. This is the 2nd of her books I have read. This had in depth character relationship between the main character and her mother, her live in boyfriend, his kids, his x, but concentrated on the aging mother daughter relationship."
4,not Tan's best,"I've read all of Amy Tan's books, and while I enjoyed this one, I would say it's my least favorite. It just didn't get me like the other ones did. This latest book is about the turbulent relationship between Ruth and her widowed mother LuLing. Ruth has never really understood why her mother acts the way she does, but when LuLing begins to show signs of Alzheimers, Ruth begins to discover many things about her mother's past that have been kept secret for many years. The 165-page flashback of LuLing's early life in China is very good, but it's at the end of the book. It would have been better to read that whole flasback first, because it explained all of the mysterious and unexplained references in the first half of the book. I had to go back and re-read the first half again, now that I knew what everything meant. So, if you're a Tan fan, this won't disappoint, but it doesn't quite live up to her first books."
4,Slowly pulls the reader in,"The Bonesetter's Daughter took nearly 100 pages before I got into it, but after that I was really hooked. Amy Tan is very good at building anticipation. By the time the secrets begin to be revealed, Tan has built up the reader's interest to the point where you are desperate to know. Once I was gripped, I couldn't put this book down. Tan has an excellent ability to take her characters on a journey that will lead them to better understand themselves and their loved ones. The Bonesetter's Daughter is another example of this ability.My favourite Amy Tan novel was the Kitchen God's Wife. This book isn't quite as good as that one. The Bonesetter's Daughter is still well worth reading and highly enjoyable."
4,"Healthy ""Real"" Relationships","In The Bonesetters Daughter, we once again get to look at Chinese American families going through what is normal for all families. We get a glimpse of death, life, sorrow and hope and how all one endures makes us who we are. The book made me think of my own relationship with my mother and all the questions I've never asked her, as the main character in the novel grows to know, understand accept and eventually love her long misunderstood mother.I really enjoyed this book, but must say I loved The 100 Secret Senses better, for its magical realism which is missing from this novel."
3,Learn Cantonese and write a book.,"You must trudge your way through the first of this book before you come upon anything worth reading about. Yet, that first section becomes important toward the end when the author brings you back to modern times. Had Tan spent the entire novel on the Mother's Chinese upbringing, this book would have been a much better read. Yet the other section did spark an interest in me to try to write down the story of my own family, or to at least write something. Keep at this book and it will be rewarding."
5,I loved this book!,"I am not going to give a plot summary like so many other reviewers have done. I will simply say this: if you are looking for an excellent book, read The Bonesetter's Daughter. It's worth your time."
4,My First Amy Tan Book,"I loved the book; in a way, it was as though I read two different books. The first part of the novel, with Ruth in present day San Francisco living with her ""significant other"" and being a pseudo-Stepmom to his two daughters, was frankly quite boring. Ruth was really getting on my nerves. I felt she let the girls treat her badly, and the way she seemed to need their love and approval was disgusting. Ruth was such a doormat. But then Ruth finds her mother's diary in which she has written down the things she does not want to forget. The story takes off for me then. The story Ruth's mother tells is a great historical fiction love story. I was fascinated by hearing details of China during World War II. The characters were well drawn and I cared deeply for them. I thought it was a wonderful story of mother-daughter relationships."
4,Judging book by cover,I like this book very much. It remind me of days spent in China when I was little girl. Ms Tan is very good writer and you will enjoy.
4,I liked it! A little annoying but liked it!,"Another good book by Amy Tan. I found it intriguing thought some of the characters were positively annoying. Those fears, insecurities and mambo jumbo left me flat. The story is amazing. The flow is incredible. I am not sure if her intention was to show how annoying such paranoia is. If her intention was that, she succeeded. :0)"
4,no exactly,"I'm sorry this is not a review about the book, it's about the purchase.The book is used by look good.However, the cover is not the same, I believe it's from an older publication, which was not mentioned in the sale description."
2,Haven't I Seen This Movie Before?,Hmm. Amy Tan presents another cross-generational tale about the relationship of Chinese & Chinese-American mothers and daughters.How many times can this woman go to the well?
1,Truly Disappointed,"I've read all her books, and I must say this one is the worst. I started reading it last summer, and I finally gave it up 1 year later, leaving it half-done. The plot is very similar to her other books, the same ghost, spirit stuff. It always start with a mysterious relative who believes in the existence of ghost, and the main character used to have conflict with her. Then as the story carries on, history is revolved, and the main character gradually start to know her loving relative's story.I thought it would be a interesting story, yet I guess this is just another version of her previous stories."
1,A book to read before bed..it puts you to sleep,"I have been a fan of Amy Tan's books, I loved all of her previous books, so when I purchased The Bonsetter's Daughter I was so looking forward to reading it, however, it turned out to be a huge disappointment, it put me to sleep. I found it very slow and quite frankly boring!"
2,"Sorry, just don't get it","Have never submitted a review, but felt compelled.Kept waiting for something of interest but it never came. Cannot recommend."
3,Great start but peters out,"Like alot of the reviewers, I'm an Amy Tan fan, especially of the Joy Luck Club and the Kitchen God's Wife, but not a Hundred Secret Senses. I really enjoyed the first third about Ruth, because there are many elements that sound very authentic (making me believe that this part was autobiographical). Some parts also happened to be very funny, which isn't something I would normally expect from a Tan novel, since her novels tend to be pretty serious. The second and third parts don't have the same punch as the first. Also, although I was happy everything worked out for Ruth and her mom (haven't they been through enough?!), I have to admit it didn't feel as authentic as the first part. Overall, not a masterpiece, but worth reading."
2,"Amy Tan fan, but this one was disappointing",Ive enjoyed all of Amy Tan's books except this one. Ruth and her boyfriend Art are boring and unlikable characters. The way their dead relationship suddenly turns all perfect was ridiculous and sappy. their dialouge was like something out of a bad harlequin romance. I did enjoy reading about Lu Ling's past and was disappointed when it returned to the dumb story about Ruth and Art. The ending of this book was extremely sappy. Very unsatisfying book.
2,Not the best,"Although just engaging enough for me to finish reading it, overall this book was a big disappointment. I felt that I kept waiting for something to happen. The writing is competent, but it wasn't that interesting and I didn't get much out of it."
5,I couldn't be happier,"I love to bake bread thanks to this book. It's very informative without being textbookie feeling. The directions are clear, concise,and virtually fool proof. You also get step by step photos to go along with the directions the only downside (if you can even call it that) is that the photos are in black and white. This is the second time I had to purchase this book because the first one just disappeared one day after I had some friends over, and I just couldn't do without it."
5,Excellent CD,It is an excellent CD for the people who want to discover the beautiful music of Ennio Morricone.
2,only 28 minutes...thus overpriced,"mediocre selection, more like spanish elevator salsa....and only 28 minutes long, 9 songs..way too short for my money's worth"
2,A Backyard Production,"I was not impressed. This film was very cheasy and boring. The picture is awful and the so called acting is terribly lame. It looks like a bunch of neighbors got together and said ""let's make a movie."" This is not even fun for kids. A BIG WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,Review,"Although ''universal'', It didnt fit what i needed it for.Adorama 3-12 Volt DC / 500mA Regulated Universal AC Adapter with Multiple Connector Ends."
2,"Glad I bought two, one went bad","Liked the price, so I purchased two for replacement of a unit that needed 12v, negative ground. I'm glad I did, one went bad within the first hour of use. I was on a gig, using the adapter for musical equipment, so it would have been tough if I didn't have the backup. Next time, I'll buy a different brand for more bucks."
2,Adorama multiple adapter with multiple connector ends,"The adapter appears to be a multiple adapter -- BUT the one specific size connector I needed for 4.5 volt does NOT fit the two 4.5 volt openings for which I ordered the adapters! ;-( Also, for the correct settings to use ---the directions are of no help at all!"
2,Doesn't fit everything!,"It did not fit what I needed it to fit, I have a 6v battery for a riding toy and none of the fittings worked!"
1,Dissapointing (spanish version),"I suppose this book could be a very basic first step for people that never, in their whole life, asked themselves about death and never even look outside the window to watch nature. It starts great with the statement that WE ALL ARE GOING TO DIE. But from there, is bla bla, with superficial examples that not support the cientific method she tried to use in the book to reach conclusions. She never explain how to reach and help a person that is in a terminal condition, or how to explain to him/her that death is unavoidable. In fact, I read the book in less than one day because I didn't want to return later to finish it. With so many good books outthere about death, this is one you should pass."
2,Not a good book.,"Morrison obviously has friends of his in CT writing the reviews for this terrible piece of toilet reading. The exercises are not at all accessible, and even if they were, they are so antiquated, they hardly speak to the modern actor. To say this is an exicting read is a bold-faced lie, since it is so often caught up in enjoying it's own rhetoric, it vears from the point. This may be a useful book for research purposes, or for the novice, but in terms of being a valuable asset to the aspiring professional, look elsewhere. Much better, and more accessible texts have been written by Cohen, Hagen, and Mamet, with far more bearing on the modern American Theatre."
5,Awesome paper!,"I am a professional artist. I recently purchased a large format HP printer to print gallery quality art prints to sell on my website and at art shows. I bought this paper to use with an Epson printer, for obvious reasons, and by chance, I ended up with the HP version printer. Well, the paper works great with HP if you were wondering! The image is so beautiful on the paper and the paper is just lovely to touch!Do pay close attention when you open the paper out of its plastic pouch which side is the front and which is the back. The difference is not obvious and the print will look faded on the wrong side. I made the mistake. It's too expensive of paper, to make it again!!Otherwise, I absolutely love it!"
1,constant paper jam with this paper,"It is rare that I write a review. I do read and appreciate other reviews though. That is why I felt it is important to leave one about this paper.In terms of quality - it does do nice print outs. In terms of printing with it - it is a nightmare!I am using an Epson R1900. It is almost impossible to feed this paper in the manual paper feeder in a way, that is accepted by the printer. I would say at least 9 out of 10 times, does this paper not feed into the paper feeder correctly. Anybody who has to work efficiently and whose time is valuable cannot afford to buy an expensive paper and then spend hours trying to get a few prints done.I would never, ever buy this paper again. I am really angry to have spend my money on an epson paper to use with my epson printer and then not be able to easily print.If you own an R1900 do not buy this paper!"
1,Damaged fine art paper,"I had previously sent an email with pictures addressing this issue (about 2 weeks now), and as of this writing I have not heard back.Amazon usually packs the shipments well, but this wasn't the case with the last one.The bubble wrap was wound around very loosely (1 layer), and then the item was put in a larger box without anyadditional padding. It must have been dropped, hitting one corner, as ALL the paper got bent on that spot.Annoying, and a bit of a waste of time and money."
3,OK for lettering,Did not find all that I wanted to regarding the needlepoint stitching of letters. Not enough variety to help with all my projects.
4,Bobby Valentino an Enigma,"Bobby Valentino Looks like Clark Gable,Sings like Mike Halliday (or Bing Crosby take your pick) and plays Violin like Stefan Grapelli (well not that good but you get the picture). Along the way he makes very sweet music that will appeal to more discerning listeners who are not just locked into the current big thing. This music is not world changing nor is it ground breaking but it is very melodic and lots of fun."
3,Good price but extra work to install.,My husband had to use some existing parts from our old sensors to get them on our 1997 Chevy K1500.
2,Decent product but doesn't last long,Product is great if you are looking to protect the screen from scratches. On the down side the case cracks and breaks over time. Mine started cracking & breaking within weeks.
1,Poor Quality Picture,Although I had The Scarlet Pimpernel on VHS I wanted to get it on a DVD thinking I would have a better quality picture but this particular version is not recommended. The quality of the picture and sound is extremely poor. Don't recommend you buy it.
1,Poor quality release,This video is so poor quality we couldn't watch more than 5 minutes. They really need to restore the film and sound track!
3,Great Film/Terrible DVD,"As some others have said, you get what you pay for with this DVD. However, Leslie Howard is inspired in this movie and it is well worth watching despite the DVD's limitations. My rating of 3 is an average of the movie's 5 and the DVD's 1. The Scarlet Pimpernel is a great story, but no one brings the character to life like Howard."
1,Don't Throw the Baby out with the Bath Water,"The 1935 Scarlet Pimpernel film, while poorly represented in this particular dvd, is a real treasure. For those of us waiting for a decent copy to appear on the scene, there is a ray of hope! Janus Films is screening a greatly restored version on Hulu.com here in the USA. Could Criterion be far behind with a forthcoming disc? Let us hope!!"
2,Corny,Not only is this movie corny but I didn't like how it was re-done. It doesn't seem of best quality.
3,Just Okay,"After seeing the one with Jane Seymour this one is hard to swallow, but it was still enjoyable."
1,pimpernil,"Not what I expected, Don't really know what it was that i expected, but this copy was much too old. My son will soon be starring in this production and I was hoping to learn a bit about the play and hear the music before seeing the production. This is not what I should have ordered."
3,Older version and it shows....,"For this price, it probably doesn't matter, but if you want the best ""Scarlett Pimpernel"" by the one with Anthony Andrews. This is an old grainy black and white film, and it's not very well constructed. It's more like a stage play. If you're a history buff, or fan of Leslie Howard you may get more out of it but I was disappointed."
5,A fantastic black and white adventure,"For any of you that are familiar with, and enjoy, the Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orzcy, you will enjoy this film adaptation of this classic novel. Adventure, intrigue, trust and betrayal are all part of this amazing story. Leslie Howard is an amazing Scarlet Pimpernel and Merle Oberon a convincing Marguerite."
4,Scarlet Pimpernel,"I was happy with the presentation of The Scarlet Pimpernel with Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon, made in 1935, which I purchased from Amazon. I made allowances for the age of the movie and I was not disappointed in the presentation because I expected exactly what I got. I have the vhs version and the dvd was exactly the same quality. Incidentally, the Synergy version was adversly critized in other reviews, which I read before my purchase."
2,poor quality,Unfortunately the quality of the print was unsatisfactory. I bought it as a gift for my mother and she thought the quality was very poor.
4,close but not perfect,"This is an outstanding film, but while this is a good copy and better than what I've had in the past, it's not as good as I wanted."
4,old time adventure,This is a classic and exciting tale. It is as entertaining today as ever. The quality of the film transfer leaves a bit to be desired. This classic film could use a bit of digital restoration. But the entertainment value of the story and the performances make up for this minor flaw.You will not feel you have wasted your money. This is worth having in your collection.
4,A great transfer,"The synergy brand DVD is an excellent transfer for this very, very old movie. It didn't have any color changes or blobs running through the frames, and it was clear with good contrast. If you want a copy of this old gem, you should buy the Synergy product.The movie itself is a wonderful old drama about a hero of the French revolutionary period, much like the Zorro tales. It is one of the best for those who like old movies."
5,6 out of 5 stars,"This must be Leslie Howard's best performance, the best film version of Scarlet Pimpernel and one of the best screen adaptions of a classic book. The 'cravat' scene must be one of the most amusing episodes in film history.The plot has been changed somewhat, especially the end, but the film creates such a sense of unity and rightness that I sometimes forget that 'that's not how it goes in the book'. Of course, if you didn't read the book, or don't remeber it or don't mind when movies deviate from the novels they were inspired by, there's nothing at all to worry about.Merle Oberon is a suitably beautiful but disenchanted French wife to Leslie Howard, who is a master at his changes of personality from 'Sir Percival Blackeney' to 'The Scarlet Pimpernel'. The film sticks to the spirit of The Scarlet Pimpernel even when it deviates from the letter."
2,Technically awful,"Technically bloody awfull, otherwise great. Was it really worthwhile to DVDize this particular copy?What has happened to the color version, also with Leslie Howard, that I saw in Zürich in 1946 - 1953?"
1,One of the All Time Great Movies - Butchered,"This movie has been one of my favorites. I just purchased this DVD for my collection. I can live with poor film quality, I can live with bad sound, but missing scenes is unacceptable.The scene where Percy tells Armand that he still loved Marguerite is missing!! This my be the most important scene in the movie.I love the Leslie Howard version, lets hope someone will do a proper restore of this great classic."
1,The missing scenes,We had rented a VHS copy after not seeing this for years. Shortly after we bought this DVD version. What a disappointment! Especially the missing material related to the Romney portrait scene. Whole portions of the sub-plot make no sense without it all. Wait till someone gets this right.
1,Terrible dvd produced by Reel Classic Films,"This is not a review of the film itself, of which I have fond memories. However, this release is simply awful.The picture is distorted, cramped and shaky - imagine someone videotaping their television screen while the movie was playing. That's precisely the ""quality"" of this dvd. The sound is muffled and distorted as well.Even the packaging is poor - the cover design is something which a half-way competent ten year old could have made if given access to Adobe. Not to mention that the prongs holding the dvd in place are ineffectual in retaining the disc.Truly terrible dvd of a very good movie. There are other versions of this very same movie available. I can't believe Amazon put this on their site as a legitimate commercial product when it has all of the ear marks of being a pirated copy. Do not be gulled into buying this travesty of a dvd put out by ""Reel Classic Films""."
1,Inferior Video Transfer,"Madacy continues to underwhelm when it comes to video transfers to the DVD medium. Copies always look as though they were made from an inferior VHS tape. If you ever wondered why Madacy's DVD titles were so inexpensive, now you know. The movie itself is a classic, though."
1,Madacy Strikes Again!,"This is a wonderful film (I have the Samuel Goldwyn laserdisc release that was distributed a few years ago by HBO) but the public domain print that Madacy has released is absolutely criminal! I have burned a couple of times by this label. The low price may seem to be a bargain, but remember, you get what you pay for. Leslie Howard deserves better treatment!Speaking of Mr. Howard, his last film, PIMPERNEL SMITH (which updates the story to World War II) is also available through Amazon.Com. I cannot, as yet, attest to it's video quality, but the film is a worthy successor to the original."
1,DVD version,I was very dispointed with the DVD verison. The cut takes out two scenes which where some of my favorites and where important to the moive because of what was said and seen in the moive.
1,Stick With the '81 Version,"This is not a review of the film, but of the DVD. All of the DVDs I have seen of this classic look like they have been duped from an eighth-generation copy. At one time, I had the Samuel Goldwyn-issued Laserdisc (which was superb) so I know that a quality print exits out there somewhere. Maybe in the Korda or Goldwyn vaults? Come on, guys, shake it loose! Until that happens, we will have to be satisfied with the 1981 version starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour and Sir Ian McKellan. That is the best quality version currently available."
1,Horrible Quality,I wish I had kept my VHS copy. The 2007 DVD is a waste of money. There are several problems with the picture and sound.
1,Be aware of your version quality,"Our classic movie ""Scarlett Pimpernel"" came wiht unacceptable sound and scenes missing. Seller should have warned about being a second rate copy."
2,"Love the movie, poor quality DVD","I love movie. I need to be more sure that I am getting remastered discs from original Motion Picture Corporations. This one is so ""washed out"". Very disappointed."
5,I love the Scarlet Pimpernel.,"I have read the book, ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", and have seen the Broadway play nine times. This movie is a classic; Leslie Howard gives perhaps the best performance of the century in this movie. I urge everyone and anyone to buy it; you'll love the storyline! It's the best story of all time!"
1,"Poor Print Qualtiy, No Cover","Yes, this is an old movie, but the quality was much poorer than the video I have of it, and there was no cover picture for the DVD. I was very disappointed and certainly won't order from this source again."
2,"Great movie, pity about the DVD !","This great version of 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' deserves the full Criterion or Anchor Bay treatment -- this Madacy DVD is a disgrace! Murky picture and muddy sound -- skip it and go instead to Amazon's UK site where you can pick up on Region 2 DVD the fantastic 1980s version with Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. Don't bother with the recent TV series with the normally excellent Richard E Grant -- it's a travesty, with none of the spirit of the book, so faithfully re-created in both the Leslie Howard and Anthony Andrews versions."
1,warning!,"I agree with the viewer from Chicago. This is a fabulous film. Leslie Howard is brilliant (I love the way he exclaims ""Odds fish!"" in his fop persona) but this DVD is absolute c**p. The film was made in 1935, but the print under review looks as though it was unearthed from the 19th century; it's muddy and the sound is unclear. I should have known better from the packaging - Leslie Howard is spelt Lelsie (twice) and the picture they've used is not of him but of Raymond Massey, who plays the villain. You'd do better to tape this off the TV next time it comes up."
2,"Scenes cut, POOR transfer","Why do they have to ruin everything?! The boobs who released this not only cut it but also did nothing to restore it. Magnificent performance from Leslie Howard and the ever beautiful Merle Oberon. Perhaps it is not a good adaptation of the book but that does not diminish these memorable performances. If only some company would take these fine dramatic films, restore and release them in a form that would preserve the wonderful performances and production values."
1,The Real Classic Travesty of the 1934 The Scarlet Pimpernel on DVD by 'Reel Classic Films'.,"The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)I recently purchased the 'Reel Classic Films' DVD, Red Cover, of the 1934 Leslie Howard version of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" and awaited its arrival in earnest. What I got was a Botch Job Beyond Comprehension. First, the DVD commences playing without a Menu. Second, the Film Frame has been Morphed into Widescreen!!! It was originally made 4:3! Someone decided that it wasn't good enough for Widescreen Monitors in its' Original Form. I'm suprised that they didn't get out their Crayons and try to Colourise as well! Third, the Soundtrack has a repetetive Clicking Sound that occures every Two to Three Minutes which makes it Unberable to Listen to, let alone Watch. As a DVD this disc can only serve as a Coaster. Purchaser Beware!! Avoid the 'Reel Classic Films' DVD of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" or, like me, you shall be left to. ""Seek him here. Seek him there,"" to get the Real Deal Pimpernel."
3,Faithful Adaptation,"This movie was billed as an excellent adaptation of the book ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" by Baroness Orczy. The only similarities I found between the book and the movie were that a few of the lines from the book were used though uttered by the wrong characters and the names of the main characters were the same. I do not know why the screenwriters felt they had to alter the scenes and story line of the book so much, as well as omitting some of the best scenes in the book from the movie all together. Plus adding scenes to the movie that never happened in the book. The screenwriters took the character of the Scarlet Pimpernel from the book and then created basically a new story and just using a very few things from the book. If you are looking for a retelling of the book you will be disappointed. If the screenwriters were trying to make a good book better in the movie version, they failed."

3,Castles,We were a little dissapointed as we saw a few things over nad over. Otherwise it is an enjoyable film.I would not purchase it as a gift.
3,Home Sweet Home,"In-depth visits to a couple of places. Quite acceptable but quicker visits to a lot of places might be preferred (at least, that is what I expected)."
3,Beautiful Scenery,"I very much enjoyed seeing castles of Scotland as well as the coast of Scotland for the very first time! I particularly loved the second part of the dvd.The orator on the other hand, was extremely boring!"
3,Not Bad,"I would have liked a lot more historical detail and more castles covered. If you've never been or seen, still not bad to look at before travel, but would not have been helpful for my travel companion. I didn't send it back, but it just wasn't detailed enough for me."
4,*GREAT*,"Bought because of Susan Johnson and loved it! Sometime these quick HOT, HOT, HOT, stories are the best!"
4,Not for Men Only!,"Wow! A woman likes this book? Indeed! This very readable book is NOT just another ""me-too"" version of what is already out there. There's always a new spin on protecting possessions, tax aspects of the settlement--all that good meaty financial stuff--and the author is an original thinker in many areas, including important principles and tips on successful negotiating. I purchased this book to find out the ""tactics"" my cheating husband would be using in negotiation to grab as much of the goodies as he could. But along with that, I found there were quite a few tips that could benefit one whether male OR female. I guess it's like my dad always said, ""What's good for the goose is good for the gander."""
2,full,"of information however i followed the book to the letter and have lost everything in the divorce. its just not practical in todays judicial system, that is my opinion however."
1,Don't waste your money,The dancing is mostly faked with camera angles and the acting is just mostly faked. The story line is weak and obscure but other than that.........
1,One Last Dance,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to see Swayze dance as he did in ""Dirty Dancing"". THIS is NOT that. It is modern dancing in a studio and the plot is ridiculus. Swayze is a fantastic dancer and it is poetry to see him really DANCE. THIS film just not do it."
4,Visual Poetry,"No, it's not ""Dirty Dancing;"" this film is about real, classical dancing that is a joy to watch. Patrick Swayze, Lisa Neimi, and George de la Pena are brilliant dancers and bring the somewhat thin, yet still moving story to life. The company of supporting dancers is excellent, and the film shows the realities of a life of back-breaking work with few rewards lived mostly 'for the love of the game.' A tribute to true beauty, the final dance sequence is breathtaking."
5,One Last Dance,"Beautiful movie with Patrick Swayze and his wife Lisa Neimi in the leads. Great for people who like dance movies, incredible for people who like Patrick Swayze. A must see!"
4,it was a good movie,"I love to watch dance movie. It was so cool to dance like that. Glad that he went back w/ her in the end, didnt he?"
2,"wow, I was surprised","They never really seemed to get the plot together in this one... and I'm not that fond of modern dance, so it left me a little cold. Certainly not what I expected when I bought the movie based on the synopsis."
2,One Last Dance,"I wasn't crazy about this dvd. I ordered it because of Patrick Swayze dancing, but I thought it was Ballroom and it was Gay Ballet."
1,Almost shut if off due to boredom,I love a good dance movie and if the acting is not good I enjoy dancing. I may have enjoyed five possibly ten minutes of this movie. Those few minutes would have been when the dancing was good and the performers kept their mouths shut. The story line and the acting made me want to vomit. Sorry but I hated this movie and an it was not worth the rental fee I paid. There was very little excitement or proper romantic tension in this film and I really felt like shutting it off.That being said there are probably people that relate to these character's and their whiny dispositions but I did not. It was a story of lost love. The love of dance was lost and lovers were torn apart and brought back together but the people where just not likable in my opinion. I could not feel for them the way one normally does in a movie like this.
3,One Last Dance,I loved watching Patrick Swayze dancing with his wife. He is one of my favorite actors & he didn't disappoint me in this movie.
3,Patrick Swayze fan & dance fan,"Though this is a small movie, it should delight fans of Patrick Swayze and dance. Not a Dirty Dancing type movie but one in which he can star with his wife. Generally , just a nice movie that can be watched a number of times without getting bored."
1,One Last Dance,"This is a phenomenally bad movie. What an ego this woman has! Someone should have been kind enough to tell her that she should have gotten a real writer and director (of course, her acting would still have sucked). Poor Patrick."
2,One Last Dance,An amteurish effort. It's predictable and boring. Not being a dancer I didn't understand the difficulties of the steps.
1,Who wrote this?,"Waste of time. I turned it off. The ""extra features"" were slightly interesting. The actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing. A vanity piece. Why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating, badly-written melodrama. Don't bother."
4,PATRICK SWAYZE-LAST DANCE,"I have watched this video 3 times and it is wonderful. It shows Patrick Swayze and his wife at his best with his dancing. He was very good in Dirty Dancing, but I liked him the best in this video. Wish he had done more movies with his excellant training."
5,Possibley one of the most wonderful dance movies.,This is a stark and beautiful story of the tragedy and beauty of dancing life for ballet dancers. The lives of older dancers and how they are asked to return to perform their 'last dance' so tender and beautiful a story. Look beyond the words and see their dance together as one...its stunning.
3,Talented actors!,"This was a paean to and by the Swayze's . . . and if you like their type of dancing this was for you. There was not much of a story line. And in most of the movie two of the main characters were morose, angry at the world, and angry at each other. This didn't help my appreciation of the film.It is difficult to look upon dance as these dancers do, that it is the be-all and end-all of one's existence. The life span of a dancer as a dancer is so short that if they really felt this way they would end up doing away with themselves after their five or ten years in their field. That the Swayze's have returned to dance after years away, and that they have such passion as they have tried to show, was hard for me to relate to as anything short of fanciful.It is pleasant to see movie personalities, though, with real talent, rather than just looking pretty for the camera."
2,Not-so-different from Bernard Werber's idea,"I usually enjoyed comics published by Vertigo, like Hellblazer, Sandman, Fables, V for Vendetta.But this one....could use much improvement. Its basic underlying story relies heavily on Bernard Werber'sLes Thanatonautes.And most of all, when I read other Vertigo paperbacks, I feltenthusiasm, and eager to read more- but with this one, I neverfelt anything like that."
2,Steam Install will make you want to break something,"The game itself was great. But the AntiPiracy Program ""Steam"" is a Steaming Pile. First off the Install takes forever.Say you pop in your disc to play your single player game, Well if Steam wants to update your halflife copy. Well you'll just have to wait to play your game, Steam has some updating to do.One time I popped in my disc, half hour later the splash screen has no link for single player... what is this. I don't want to play online. I just want to play my game. This is so Frustrating.Because of a few people pirating games, us paying customers have to suffer. I would pay twice as much for a game to Never have to go through anything like Steam ever again."
1,Activation nightmare,"I paid 79.99 for the collectors to not be able to play it at allbecause of the activation/bandwidth problems stream has beenhaving.Avoid the nightmare: buy doom 3 instead and play right away, orbetter yet...these bozos deserved to get their code stolen..."
1,Collector's Edition Rip Off,"What a rip off, you'd be better off getting the Gold Edition from Steam. This set isn't worth a dime, except the game.With GOLD from STEAM, you'd get these:? Half-Life 2? Counter-Strike:Source? Half-Life 1:Source? Day of Defeat:Source*? Valve's back catalog available (listed here).HL2 Merchandise:? HL2 posters (3 total)? HL2 hat? HL2 soundtrack? HL2 sticker? City 17 postcard? Prima's HL2 strat guide? Special collector's box? Chance to win trip to Valve!Now compare that with what you're getting with this Collector's Ed."
1,Disappointed,"To play this game you have to be connected to ""STEAM' with a persistant internet connection. Why! Obviously it is a veiled attempt to spy on my play or perhaps even extract personal information off my computer. I see no other value. All I wanted was a game to play when I want, in the privacy of my home. I can accept going online to verify that I purchased the game legally, but that is the limit of intrusion I will allow. If you don't mind Big Brother watching you, buy the game. Otherwise, you don't need this kind of gameplay."
4,Weakest ending of any compuer game,"This is probably the best game on the market. Most of the short comings have been noted in other reviews, however, I did not see anyone mention the incredibly weak ending. It goes like this; First, you blow apart Dr. Breens transporter in a firefight that will definitely have your family yelling 'turn that thing down'! Next, Alyx runs out to congradulate you. Then, suddenly, the frame freezes and in walks the G-Man with some boring discourse - end of game. You never resolve the sexual tension with Alyx, drink a beer with Barney, find out what happen to Eli, or finish a Zen conversation with the Vortigaunt. It's as if the programmers stopped short to meet a deadline."
1,requieres steam,requieres steam and is too expensive I think.I would rather buy it without DRM or restrictions like steam etc.
5,Best shooter ever? No. That's still reserved for HL1,"But this is an awesome sequel which is just as good as the first!Technically it's superior but otherwise it feels like the same old game with an incredible physics engine which is so much fun to play around with online. The story itself is excellent, the gfx is consistently amazing and crisply detailed. All together this conjures up a believable world which had me at times scared out of my seat with some of the nasty new monsters. I mean this game has some NASTY realistic visceral monsters in it which look so cool. And the sounds some of them make... oh.. man.. especially when they leap towards you... really creepy.The only problem I had with this Collector's Edition was the T-shirt. Does valve think that all their customers weigh over 250 pounds? The shirt is HUGE!"
3,Oh the possibilities,"i preordered this game before it was released and picked it up the day it came out in stores. thus began the biggest waste of 60 bucks i've ever hadthe game was amazing, spectacular graphics, intense action, and clever puzzles. however it would lock my system up every 10 minutes or so.i talked to tech support for my system and through steam and no one could fix my problem. my computer exceeds the minimum requirements in all aspects.so nearly a year after its release, i will never know the end of the game, nor do i care any more. valve rushed out an unfinished product and could not provide the entertainment value promised from such a high expectation title. so if your system can play it, congrats, i'm sure the game is amazing. i'll just never know."
1,it sucked,they gave me the wrong disk i asked for the cd-rom they gave someelse i should get a free collector's edition half-life 2
4,A winning protagonist . . . .,"This is the third outing for Los Angeles gardener Mas Arai and Hirahara generally maintains her high standards in delineating the characters of both the people of the Japanese-American subculture and their city. One of Mas's friends has won a half-million dollar jackpot on a slot machine -- which Mas, an inveterate horse and card player, ordinarily considers a sucker bet -- and the celebration thrown by another of his friends ends with the murder of the winner. Mas gets sucked into things against his will and soon is trying to figure out how an antique Okinawan musical instrument became involved, and what the crime might have to do with another death fifty years before. And then the Department of Homeland Security gets into the act. The plot doesn't seem quite as well thought out as in the first two books, but I enjoyed the interplay among the characters, . . . especially Mas's interest in a female African-Okinawan detective."
4,Best in the Mas Arai Series So Far,"The other three reviews have done a good job of summarizing the plot in this book. I would just like to add that I have read all three of the Mas Arai mysteries and felt that this by far was the best. The characters were the most realistic, the writing style has evolved and to me flows the best of the three, and the book itself was pretty intriguing. It had me turning the pages to see what would happen next. Having grown up in the area and being a Sansei (third-generation Japanese-American), the book held special interest for me because of the characters, locale, and situations. But even without this, it is a book that is worthwhile reading. I'd recommend it unhesitatingly."
4,Snakeskin Shamisen,I enjoyed reading about Mas and his adventures. It was my first encounter with him. I will read more of his adventures.
3,snakeskin shamisen,"Not as suspenseful as promised. Slow moving and difficult to understand at times due to American/Japanese jargon. Has amusing, quaint moments."
1,You get what you pay for.,"For very young children who want ""more"" of something, this looks really good. 72 pencils for almost no money at all. If you want to actually, color or draw with them, they are faded and hard to work with. Unless these are for very young children who just want to look at pretty colors on a stick, pass. Older kids need Crayola twistables, kids (or adults) with moderate talent or interest in drawing need Prismacolor Verithins and then regular Prismacolors. People with real talent need a Wacom tablet."
1,Do not buy from Amazon,"The product deserves 5 stars, Amazon's packaging deserves 0 stars. Amazon ships sturdy books with more protective packaging than these delicate biscuits had (they were in a cardboard sleeve). Instead of getting a box of six biscuits, I got a box of crumbs. I wish I were exaggerating, but not one biscuit was even half intact. This was a complete waste of money, and a complete disappointment. I'll buy Viennese Whirls again, but not from Amazon."
2,Very Poor Sound Quality,"Good songs, but literally many of the songs were bootleg versions with very poor sound. At one point you can even hear someone coughing."
1,Nothing as advertised,This video purports to give information about the Weimaraner and its training. It does nothing of the sort. A real disappointment
5,Wonderful Cookware,"Durable, longlasting and and a great additional to my kitchen. Hold the heat evenly and does not scratch or peel. Great cookware."
4,Almost Perfect,"I love this pan. It is basically a mini flat-bottomed wok, and the perfect size for cooking small amounts. Great for a single person. I use it constantly, and it really deserves a 5 star rating, except for a single flaw. The handle attaches to the pan with rivets, and the connection is very loose. There is a good quarter inch of play, which gets old with frequent use. I do not believe the handle will actually come off, but it is a big flaw in an otherwise great product. I have ordered other Joyce Chen pans and never had a problem, so it could be this is an isolated issue. Even with the loose handle, I still recommend this pan highly."
4,try track 3!! (you'll see),"Try track 3 -you'll see!!! ""we got a war on everybody...I've seen the milk cartons, 30,000 missing people a year; where do they go; what happens to 'em...""...and track 8 has got something too...and track 9..."
4,Very sad!,"I saw it Saturday. You are sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time. It set the tone for the rest of the day. We were pretty somber as we walked out of the theater. I can't imagine how the loved ones of these people feel. Anger because it should have never happened, and grief they will never get over!I already had a problem flying and now I don't know if I will ever get on another plane!"
2,Smoke and Mirrors,"Slick theatrical reproduction of the official storyline of Flight 93. Does not address the fact that cell phones ( at that time) do not work above 2000 ft. altitude and the plane was far above that when the first calls supposedly came in. One of the callers called his mother and used his last name. Who does that when they call their mother? He also asked, "" Don't you believe it's me?"" Most telling smoking gun briefly glossed over in this film is the fact that the crash site was a crater about 30 ft. in diameter and 10 ft. deep with small pieces of light aluminum scattered around.No engines, tail section, wings, seats, bodies, luggage, nothing you would find at commercial airliner crash site no matter what the angle of impact. The first responders said, "" There's no airplane here, let's look in the woods for it."" The plane was never found in the woods or anywhere else. Americans need to wake the freak up before it's too late. Our country is being stolen from us. Robert J."
4,Not Sure if I Should Suggest It...,"An amazing movie...I watched live as all of it happened..wow...and just saw the part when the characters saw it for the first time and it hit me like a ton of bricks in the chest...I'm not sure if the world is or ever will be ready for this, but it is very well made. Sort of helps. I really recommend it, but it will probably be hard."
5,Wonderfully done,"I am so glad they chose unknown actors (who were very, very good, incidentally). Hopefully, they will have good careers in the future. Writers, director and producers did an incredible job of piecing together the taped phone conversations and interviews with family members, forming a riveting portrayal of the courageous crew and passengers who decided to take matters into their own hands. They knew they were going to die anyway, so they refused to let the hi-jackers reach their intended target, which was probably the White House. I was particularly touched by the passenger who asked his support person on the other end of the line to pray the Lord's Prayer with him. Wish I could give it more than five stars."
1,Flight 93,"I never actually watched this particular movie,because I ordered the wrong one. I had meant to order United 93 the one that was in theaters. I never knew that there were 2 movies. So I ended up trading Flight 93 for United 93. I have never seen Flight 93,but have seen United 93."
1,Pure Government Propaganda,"- Nothing about the Stand-down order. The phoney ""there was a drill going on"" excuse.- Includes the phoney cell phone calls.This is the actual ""Conspiracy Theory"" - that a hijacked jet could fly around for hours without being intercepted (evidence shows that it was shot down by a fighter, but it makes more sense and is more emotionally gripping that the passengers crashed the plane); taken over by a bunch of crazies with box cutters.It would make me laugh if it was'nt so sad.It is interesting that these films are coming out now, when the people in power need to beat the war drums yet again for another invasion. This ""documentary"" is designed to switch off your brain so it can feed you this bloody fairy tale."
1,Clearplay filter only good for cat# 40921,"This DVD uses God's name in vain along with other profanity. The only Clearplay filter available for Flight 93 is for catalog number 40921. The catalog number is on the spline of the DVD case. The number of the one I rented is 2069, but the filter I downloaded would not work with it. Therefore I stopped playing the DVD so I can't tell you anything about the movie beyond about 10 minutes."
5,A response to a review below,"All new readers...see "" H. A Huffman ""haumf"" "" below.(What is doubly amazing is that this person can read and write.)anyway...I thought this movie was done very well considering the sadness we all still feel."
3,Cool concept - Flimsy Toy,"The Star Wars Transformers line is a great concept for anybody (kid or adult) who loves both worlds. Unfortunately, the actual toys aren't nearly as durable as they should be. I owned some of the original Transformers from the 80s and early 90s, and they were much sturdier than this. Both of Boba Fett's arms came off the first time I tried to transform him - I could pop them back on with a little effort, but it's discouraging that the toy should fall apart so quickly. Another issue is the folding of Slave 1's engine area, where the final configuration seems to put stress on the plastic in ways that will cause eventual cracking.I bought this toy primarily as a decoration for my office - I'm probably going to leave it in Slave I mode for most of the time, except when I demo it as a conversation piece with my co-workers. If you're a collector this is worth owning for the novelty, but anyone buying it for practical play should probably go with a sturdier toy instead."
3,Not her best yet,"I see everyone gave this CD great reviews, but I wasn't impressed. I am a huge Bevill fan and her other CD's such as ""Love of heaven"" have been played over & over again. This CD didn't embrace me. I thought it was boring and each song being too repititious."
3,A bit boring...,"John might be a great drummer, but I wouldn't say he's a great teacher. The DVD is a bit boring with John's constant gaps between sentences and words making you feel like he's still think about what exactly he wants to say while you sit and wait...A lot of the times on the DVD, John will talk about something and the demonstrations are often either too short or just not enough to fully understand what hes doing.I must admit, I watched this DVD after watching Steven Smith's Drum Technique/History of the US Beat DVD which is possibly why I find this DVD rather disapointing..."
3,ok,"This is a DVD showing you how John plays...... His grooves are good and the showmanship he developed is great but techniques and teaching them is not his forte. For teachings and techniques go to guys like Chuck Silverman, Steve Smith, G.L. Stone and Jim Chapin. For his show and grooves it's ok."
3,"Great drummer, average teacher","In looking for drum technique DVDs, I look for DVDs where the drummer teaches you clearly what he is demonstrating on the set. John is a fantastic drummer. However, the ""teaching"" side of the DVD is weak. This is true particularly compared to the gold standard of teaching DVDs like Steve Smith's and even Tommy Igoe's Groove Essentials. John doesn't slow down much of what he is doing, so whatever you pick up will be a full speed. So, it is better if you are a highly advanced, professional level drummer.That said, watching this DVD I picked up some amazing things to imitate -- his amazing ambidexterity with the high hat; why play it with the right hand when it's on the left side of your set -- just play mainly with the left hand. Also the single handed roll and bass techniques are amazing and advanced.Buy it only if you are an advanced drummer."
4,Hot Cop and Flighty Woman Collide,"Romance could be found in any given situation and I didn't doubt the sparks that flew between Vanessa and Eric however some parts just didn't sound right. For instance if I am in a life and death situation no job is worth my life. I would leave a job before I put my life on the line. So that part just rubbed me wrong. However, for the rest of the book it was good. The chemistry between Vanessa and Eric was sweet. There were totally believable parts where he would tell her to stay put and she wouldn't (shaking my head). Overall, this is a book that has you guessing until the end who the betrayers are....you won't guess who did it until the end. For that I gave it more stars."
4,Great for Psoriasis,"This is a great product, I can use it on my scalp to clear my psoriasis outbreaks instead of using shampoos which ruin my hair color products! I am so happy to be able to buy salon shampoos again! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the spout isn't narrow enough so you often end up using too much on the scalp which makes your hair look very greasy at the roots so I have to be very careful about applying it. A tip that was more narrow similar to a nasal spray bottle would be much better."
5,Couldn't Be Happier With These Bags,"These bags are so awesome. They hold a wide range of items, and are extremely durable. I'm so glad I got them. I've shipped many items with them, and have never had a problem. They've helped save so much in shipping costs. They are very easy to use."
5,Perfect mailing envelope for most clothing.,"REally appreciate having these great mailers as an aid in my online business. They provide good protection for the items I send out, whether I need to use a protective barrier such as bubble wrap or not. The adhesive is good and holds very well. Weather doesn't present a problem to this material."
4,Not just the same old country house formula,"I stumbled on this book by accident. What a pleasure to encounter a mystery writer with an original mind who can really write. All too often, new mysteries are just variations on the same old formula, but this was one good novel; well-defined characters, vivid setting, and a complex plot, not to mention a main character sleuth who experiences growth throughout the novel. I'd recommend it to anyone.I've already picked up ""The Sculptress"" which I happened to catch on PBS more than a year ago. Unfortunately, I only saw the first installation, but since I picked up ""The Ice House"", I can now find out how the other fascinating story ends!"
4,Good English Who Done It.,"Small village in England, three women live there. Bad things happening. Old style mystery. Problem I have is when you have several characters that are referred by mulitple names. (like first and last name, and maybe sargent or officer) So that made it a little hard. Interesting story. Alot of English slang too, that made it difficult for me."
4,A good mystery,Being an avid mystery reader I felt this book was top notch with just enough twists and turns to keep a reader at the edge of their seats. It was difficult to put down. My only problem was how Detective Mcloughlin was potrayed by the writer. He speaks in an unarticulate manner and sounding very uneducated at the beggining of the novel and suddenly he becomes this witty well spoken philosophical character. I thought this to be a little odd and unrealistic. With that observation the book is still a great read.
4,A Clever Mystery,"The Ice House by Minette Walters tells the story of three women, Phoebe, Anne and Diana who live together in a mansion called Streech Grange. Their gardener Fred discovers a body in the ice house on the grounds. The police try to unravel the mystery and determine who the body is and who murdered him. There are numerous twist and turns and the reader becomes involved with the daily lives of the characters in the novel. This is a mystery which keeps you guessing until the end.I would recommend this to a traditional mystery fan."
4,The Ice House,"Another well written mystery. Easy and compeling to read, with good twists and turns. The characters are interesting. I think her other novel Fox Evil is slightly better."
5,read this book!,"this is definitely worth reading. the only thing about the book that bothered me was the picture on the cover didn't match the image in my head of the mansion. besides that, this book was amazing! the characters are very well developed, walters constantly keeps changing the rules and keeps you guessing til the very end. having read some of her other books, i would have to say that this pattern is consistant thru all her books and makes her an author worthy of the awards she's won. just remember...nothing in this book is quite what it seems..."
2,Implausible and sketchy,"I picked this up on a whim and kept reading with with the hope that it would improve as it went along. No such luck. Walters creates sketchy characters that ring completely false and plops them down in an English village that's about as lifelike as a shopping-mall display. Nothing anyone does makes sense, least of all the ""romance"" at the center of the book. A few vicerally disgusting moments toward the beginning make for a throughly unappetizing stew of a book. Won't be reading anything else by this author any time soon."
3,okay but not great,"It was hard to really root for any of the characters in the book. Everyone had too much baggage for me to care if they caught the murderer or not. And in the end, the murderer seemed to appear out of nowhere. I didn't even remember the person's earlier appearance. Still, at least it was a fast read."
4,"A cleverly conceived, well-executed mystery","What a great book! The award-winning THE ICE HOUSE is a thoroughly entertaining novel filled with some of the wittiest prose and sharpest dialogue I've ever read. Minette Walters is a gifted writer; her narrative is lucid as well as literate, and her characters are flawlessly constructed. There's also a fine plot in this book, with quite a few crafty twists and turns; my only complaint is that a few of the plot strands could not be deduced by the reader. In the sense of the Golden Age detective story, then, I suppose Walters ""cheated"" a bit. Nonetheless, THE ICE HOUSE is such a gloriously savory dish it's quite overlookable. Lovers of P.D. James and Ruth Rendell will undoubtedly enjoy the work of this hot new British author. One down, five to go. Next stop: THE SCULPTRESS..."
4,Compelling,"I read this book in one day because I just had to know the truth! The characters are unique, believable and there's always more to them than it seems. The good guys are fun to love and the bad guys are even more fun to hate.Great mystery and an interesting study in human nature."
2,too basic,"This is a very thin book, and contains only the most basic beginner information regarding a few beginner stitches and such. Overpriced for what you get, in my opinion."
5,kids can knit,"very good book --- easy to understand directions and the pictures are quite helpful, also. I think it is a good book for adults who are learning to knit because of the easy to understand directions, too"
2,Too much marching,"There was too much marching and clapping here. It seemed like that was all we were doing for half the time. She would teach a step, we would do it a few times and then march some more. It would have been more enjoyable, interesting and more of a workout to just do the actual steps more. Some of the steps were difficult or confusing to learn, mostly because the camera would focus on the upper body of Suzanne so we couldn't see the whole step being done. Also, I just don't think this is a hard enough workout. If I'm going to take the time to exercise, I want it to be worth my while. This doesn't do it for me. I do like Suzanne's on screen personality and the music is good. I've used Suzanne's The Fix and like it much better."
2,Pretty as long as you don't eat it,"A friend recommended this to me and I fell in love with the quaint artwork. But when I buy a cookbook, I do so with the intent to cook, not to gift it to someone else. So I've been disappointed with the lukewarm results from a dozen of the recipes. Just this week I prepared the New Lane Peas and the Clam Fritters and was completely underwhelmed. Peas were a watery bland mess and the clam fritters were completely tasteless until I added additional seasonings. So if you want to give this book as a gift as other reviewers have done, go for it but please don't give it to someone who actually knows something about food. Susan's a much better artist than she is a chef."
1,Cool as last night's dishwater,"If this were a drink, that's what it would be. With a sprig of iceberg lettuce, and a film of palm oil. This is another of those books that makes you wonder whether the reviewers quoted on the book jacket could possibly be talking about the same material."
2,"Few Gems, Mostly Paste","With all the hype that ""Invisible Circus"" and ""The Keep"" have gotten, I thought that beginning with some of her short stories, would give me a better insight into the type of writer Egan is. But, I found myself very disappointed to the point where I don't think I'll read anymore of her stuff. Her stories are all written under the same style and except for the names of the characters and the places they are in, they seem to all follow the same pattern.Her stories are always about boredom, the paean of the rich, and contain enough ennui to fill a Paris Cafe. The stories about woman who have married for money are almost funny. The ""what have I done with my life"" and ""what is my true identity"" can give you a terminal case of melancholy.Because they all have the same basis bottom line, with a loud sigh, after a while they all blend into each other. They're probably a lot better if you read them one at a time as part of a magazine. But for me, blah."
3,A Mixed Bag,"It would not surprise me to learn that Jennifer Egan attended a graduate school for a degree in creative writing; her stories have the studied by-the-numbers sincerity of the typical intelligent eager grad student, looking to career her way through a writing life with focus, earnestly collecting her As. This is not entirely a bad thing: she has largely mastered the form; the problem is, the form, as well as all the well-meaning advice from teachers, may have mastered her, too, in the sense of quashing any vitality and idiosyncracy she may have possessed."
4,It is a useful book for gaining self-confidence and understanding towards dating,"This book is all about following the basic and original dating rules without changing who you really are. It has reminded me of following my heart and instinct. I would read it often when I feel confused about dating. However, there are some grammar mistakes which I think should be avoided. Anyway, it is worth buying and reading."
4,Good reading,"As with all these types of books you take what you want and leave the rest. I thought this gave some excellent validation to some of those ""best woman"" ideas that sometimes get lost when we get tangled in an emotional web. I don't know about it being the criteria for getting the best man but it sure reinforced the best woman that I had somewhat forgotten about"
1,Very little research perfomed for this book.,Very colorful if this was a fiction format. This book is not for anyone who wishes to review the literay remains of Lady Jane Grey or relevant information. Several pieces of information are inaccurate. A great use of embellishments nonetheless.
2,Wonderful embellishments,Wonderful storytelling embellishing a few well known facts. No new material. More questions arise as a result of this book than are answered.
2,2 1/2* Very Disappointed,"The elements of a great mystery are here. A book that interweaves the issue of slavery, the questions around Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, and the imperatives of the Lewis and Clark expedition with a story about a serial killer sounds promising, but the book does not deliver...There's simply not enough suspense or mystery here, the writing is often annoying, and the characters aren't very interesting. Perhaps some will enjoy this as a light read. Not recommended."
4,Fun Short Stories,"League of the Scarlet Pimpernel is an entertaining collection of short stories about Sir Percy Blakeney's adverntures outwitting the French Revolutionary Government. And, among the stories ""The Traitor"" was probably the most interesting--- What would happen if the Scarlet Pimpernel had a traitor among his league? Would he escape with his life?"
2,not what I expected,"I was expecting a regular Scarlet Pimpernel novel, rather than a collection of Scarlet Pimpernel stories. I was disappointed with my selection. I had hoped to get more insight into the actual League, but the stories did not reveal any new information."
5,Best one yet,"I love this one. I have never been so relaxed when meditating. These are short as well, so if you only have 10 minutes or so to spare at lunch, in the mornng, this is great. You can do the entire cd as well. I have a chronic illness and found this to be extremely effective in relaxing me. I also feel as if I am in a better mind set, more calm at peace with myself."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I can't believe the nerve of this fool. I've listened to numerous guided meditations and never found one so amateurly done. The guy basically gives the listeners an anatomy class, wait till you hear the kitchen knife story! After listening several times I never could lose the feeling that this is plain weird! If you enjoy this relaxation is the least of your problems."
3,its a good cook book,"I like reading this book it tells men what kind of liquor to have around, how to measure, its mostly a beginners book and it kind of funny. Even thought its really old."
3,"Very Pretty, but not really usable...","This ""towel"" is really just a thin cotton fabric that's been cut into about the size of a burp cloth and embroidered. I have to say it's very pretty, just don't plan on cleaning much drool of baby's face with it. I did use it on my shoulder the day of the baptism, and will be putting away as a keepsake, it just isn't very practical. I still took one of my other burp cloths that is made from a cloth diaper (LOVE LOVE LOVE this kind of burp cloth) and used that one."
1,scraping the barrel & retreads,"I bought this Neil Young album when it was released, originally. I still have the vinyl, it's still in awfully good condition. I was 17 going on 18 when it came out -- and I was psyched. A NEW Neil album! I'd seen him in October, 1978, the Comes A Time/Rust Never Sleeps Tour, I'd devoured Zuma, Tonight's The Night, Decade, Rust, Stars & Bars. And ... God, was this a let-down! Listening to it, now, 25 years later -- it has no freakin redeeming value. The songs from 74, 75 (and what are they doing here, anyway?) are the only ones worth salvaging (Little Wing, Old Homestead). Save your money -- buy some Neil CDs that matter."
3,Hawks & Doves,Hawks & Doves being Young's 1980 release and is a straight forward country and western album that was met with mixed reviews. I agree with Allmusic which gave this album 3/5. The songs are by no means bad but it is does not a track that is memorable. The booklet is confusing as the lyrics are hard to read and I am not sure what the cover of the star is supposed to represent. 3/5.
3,Only For Us Completeists,"OK, I admit it. It's important to have EVERY Neil Young CD. This was purchased, hoping time away from it and remastering would enlighten me in ways that'd previously been overlooked. What I discovered, however, is validation that even Mr. Young isn't unfailing and can be off-target artisticaly. I've never really understood precisely what was going on with the record, but I still think it's something to do with politics. I had to have it because -- ya know! -- it's Neil. And that should be plenty. I honestly don't believe this will get in my player very often. For Mr. Young, this is a somewhat embarassing effort. For any other artist, it would have gotten them dropped by their record label. Thank goodness it was clustered with three other first-ever releases. What's more, thankfully it's budget priced."
4,Short and sweet.,"This is a relatively short record, but it does not lack in substance. It really is overlooked as other reviewers have wisely noted. The songs are all listenable, especially cuts like ""Captain Kennedy"" and ""Lost In Space."" Not to mention ""Little Wing"", the album's opener; it's not too shabby either. I was very glad when they finally issued this on CD. I had the vinyl for years, but it's now more convenient to listen to. I was one of many among fellow Young fans, that was happy to see this issued after years of writing letters to Warner Brothers asking them to release Neil's ""lost"" albums on CD. We only have a couple more to go! But this one is not to be overlooked. I promise you won't be disappointed."
1,Horrid album,"Thin, weak, and boring. Love Neil, hate this album. A low-water mark to be sure.Not sure what the other reviewer is so excited about. Some albums are best NOT released on CD (see ""Time Fades Away"")."
1,OK,"I thought it was really helping my nails they were growing and strong like they used to be then poof one broke then another and now I'm back to where I was with peeling, splitting, breaking nails. Something I had never experienced before."
2,Disliked!,"This product made my nails very brittle! My nails were chipping before I used it, and this product made it worse! I definately will not be buying this product again!"
5,Keystone Series,"Absolutely magnificent. This series (vols.1&2 and encore) is musical heroin - I can't seem get it out of the car's CD player or removed from the ipod during my trail runs. If you're going to start anywhere with the Keystone/Pure Jerry releases, I'd reccomend this installment, just b/c I think it's unrivaled track-for-track (which may well be due to its relatively short playlist). It's hard to explain just how this ensemble of stellar talent (Merle...damn!) evokes new aspects of Jerry's play versus his work with the Dead - but there are depths of funk, soul, and blues that demand repetitive listening and, as with the GD, yield new discoveries with each replay. It's all too cool for my poor descriptive powers...just read the other reviews and then ""add to cart""!"
1,"Anyone giving this CD 5 stars is either a friend of hers or gay, or both!","I would be doing a great disservice to the Amazon community if I recommended this gem and gave it a high score. i will not lie: Phoebe Ledger (real name) does indeed have a very nice voice, better suited for lounge, jazzy music, but not for mainstream rock or pop. Since the cd is only 35 cents, if you;re really curious, go ahead and buy it, but within 3 days you'll place it back on the sales block for less, maybe a quarter. I am writing this review in 2007. She's been singing in 3rd rate dives for over 18 years now. She's poor, she's white, she's talented, and she can sing. So what's wrong? Her material sucks! She may be famous in the NYC underground, but it's hard to pay the bills on fame and crumbs. Still, I rank her higher than Yoko, Putanna Madonna, Xtina and britney. I rank Cyndi Lauper higher only becuase she had a few hit songs that still reosnate with the public (""True Colors"")."
5,A prodigiously gifted artist,"I've never seen an artist as talented. Who else do you know who can play the piano like a virtuoso, plus the accordion and electric guitar? Who else has a nuanced but strong four-octave voice, the brains to write some pretty darn funny lyrics, and the heart to pen some achingly beautiful love songs? Who else feels comfortable singing Cole Porter, swing, punk, AND ballads? Phoebe, that's who. Catch her live if you can!"
3,Good stuff,"Good production, solid riffs, and not a hint of pop-punk in sight. Well worth the investment in my opinion!"
4,Wonderful cookware,This 12 inch pan is good for cooking an assortment of items. Durable and longlasting. Wonderful addition to my kitchen.
1,Does Not Last Very Long,"Not recommended. I bought the 12-inch Joyce Chen Peking Pan just over a year ago, and was initially pleased with its performance for stir-frying smaller amounts of food and easy clean-up. However, after about 6 months of use, the non-stick coating began to degrade. At first, I noticed that the there were little ""bubbles"" in the coating. Then the bubbles in the non-stick coating disintegrated, and the bottom of the pan became pitted where it is in direct contact with the heating element on the stove. Great...bits of non-stick coating in my food! I used non-scratch wooden and plastic utensils at all times, so my conclusion is that some quality control is lacking here. For the price paid, I expected this pan to last a lot longer than 6 months."
3,Not the best choice,"I bought this wok only a few months ago and have used it maybe 5-6 times. Used it last night and the plastic handle broke into pieces, making it unusable. Stay away from the plastic-handled variety."
4,Freakbeat In The Forest,"Mid-tempo on the verge of laid-back psych freakbeat mightily reminiscent of the early Bee Gees in their ""Massachusetts"" mode. I like Kaleidoscope a lot and thought the arrangements and peformances were very original. The title tune and ""Snapdragon"" are the tracks to watch. Packaged in a cardboard EZpak case with a very nicely designed booklet."
3,The Iron,"Great piece and very well made, just doesn't seem to work as well as I thought it would. Followed the instructions and still stuck to the meat, will continue trying to get it to work but with 10 minutes between heating time you will only get one steak branded per BBQ."
2,Do not buy for the turntable,The tone arm on the turntable of this product is non adjustable and has a very heavy tracking force on records causing rapid degradation and reduced audio quality. It is not worth the money.
1,AFTER I WAS NOT SENT A RETURN TAG I WAS TOLD I HAD TO PAY A 50% STOCKING FEE,I AM SO UPSET I CAN BARELY TALK. I RECEIVED A CALL BY TELEPHONE FROM JUNGLE COMPANY TELLING ME THAT UNLESS I WITHDRAW MY COMPLAINTTO AMAZON.COM THEY WILL CHARGE ME A 50% RESTOCK FEE I TOLD THE AS SOON AS I RECEIVED MY $99 REFUND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WITH DRAW THE COMPLAINT THE MAN WENT BALLISTIC ON ME AND HUNG UP AND SAID I WOULD PAY.I AM SO UNHAPPY I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.I CALLED AMAZON AGAIN AND REPORTED THIS ISSUE.I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS PRODUCT IS ANY GOOD I DIDNT EVEN OPEN IT AND I HAD TO PAY TO RETURN IT SINCE THEY REFUSED TO SEND A PREPAID TAG.I DID TRY TO CANCEL THE ORDER BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO.MY COMPLAINT IS NOT WITH AMAZON THEY ARE A VERY EXCELLENT COMPANY IT IS WITH THIS SELLER.
2,A great book for Native American research but not for general interest.,I had to read this book and write about it as part of my History of South Carolina class and I can't deny that it's a hard read. The author references many people in the book without any explanation as to who they are or where they came from. Not to mention he constantly jumps back and forth between tribes and time periods. It was just so confusing and extremely difficult to keep up with. Let's just say it was DULL. I have a high interest in history and even of Native American history but this would probably be best as a reference for a research paper or unless you have a vested interest in Indians in South Carolina/Virginia.
1,dissapointed,"After reading all the positive remarks about these Tweezerman toenail cutters, I can only assume that the supplier or manufacturer are writing their own reviews because these cutters which I received last week, can barely cut butter let alone toenails. They are a complete waste of time and money."
1,Returning it today for refund,"I bought these nippers because of the good reviews. Received them the other day, and the next evening tried to clip my toenails, which I nearly ruined in the process.The nippers crushed my toenails but never did cut them.Thinking that perhaps my toenails might be a little TOO thick, I tried the nippers on a couple of thinner items...like some very thin cardboard...the kind that a chocolate candy bar is packaged in. Nothing. Then I tried it on a regular paper envelope folded in half. Still nothing.Asked hubby to try them just in case I wasn't doing something right. Still nothing.So I'm not real happy with these nippers and am returning them for a refund which I will use to buy a different brand. This review in no way reflects on the seller, who does not have control of product quality, and is (so far) being very responsive to my concerns."
2,Just OK,"I was hoping this was better than the nail cutters you could buy at a store that is why I made this purchase. However, I find that is not the case. Save $10 or more and get the upper end product at your local store. (Also, the ""close clip"" is VERY hard to operate.)"
4,A Very Good Review,"I liked this product very much, especially the way it fits. The only drawback is that it took a little while for it to come."
4,Taking God out of the box,"Duncan takes God out of denominational straight jackets by emphasizing God's all encompassing nature. ""Church"" for Duncan is fly fishing for salmon and trout. His love of nature provides the metaphors supporting the Christian message of resurrection. But Duncan's broad base of knowledge of other religions allows him to see the common aspects of all spiritual journeys. An excellent writer, Duncan is able to articulate his deep spirituality.If the reader is locked into a particular denominational belief system and political agenda, you'll be in for a wild ride."
5,wash out your brain with this....,"I found Duncan's book a pleasant read...I've found all of his books to be insightful and stimulating. If you are tired of the ""holier than thou"" reporting of the ""right"", this book will help wash out all their brain washing residue."
3,Fear Of Speaking Gets Comprehensive Review,"First two chapters provide comprehensive review of the fear of public speaking. If you have a serious problem with fear of speaking this is an excellent book to start with. The author slices and dices fear with great detail. The book provides considerable detail on handling your arrival on the stage and your exit. While other books may have a more complete review of speaking as a performance, this is a good beginning. If you really have something to say, the added polish of learning how to perform is probably good incremental advise. The almost mystical review of how to treat an audience seems to spin out of touch with the book's objectives. Empathy with the audience needs more treatment in this book than talking of it as energy work. About chapter six on How to Create a Performing Persona, the book runs out of steam. You will start wishing that the author would expand further on the topics. It becomes too cryptic."
2,Warning to buyers of Kindle Versions,"This commentary is a classic and NT Wright does a great job.Don't be fooled into thinking it is actually useful if you are in seminary studies. It doesn't actually tell you what the page number is, and there is no way of getting it. So when it come time to quote you get something like:N. T. Wright. The Epistles of Paul to the Colossians and to Philemon: An Introduction and Commentary (Kindle Locations 574-576). Kindle Edition.I have tried pushing the menu button, still no page numbers.The should be ashamed of letting this thing out the door like this."
4,tone the trouble zones and more,"The Ten Minute Solution with Amy Bento is the best of the ten minute bunch. Her workout is original and effective. Excellent instructions and variety. The work out is so good that fewer reps are needed. This is a fun and challenging workout for all levels!Many of my fitness clients have asked for recommendations for ""homework"" Aside from Amy Bento, I really enjoy Crunch's Belly, Butt and Boot Camp w/ Terri-Ann Kreftin, Dance off the Inches Hip Hop party w/ Jenifer Gilardi and for the more experienced, Super-Charged Kickbox Part w/ Jeannete Jenkins (she is fabu). Remember to cross train. Your muscles get used to the same old workout, be challenged but, be smart. Protect your back,by modifying stretches and/or holding on to a leg or hip for support and use the best form you can. Zip up the buns, act like you've been gut punched, relax the shoulders, knees slightly bent and lift and tighten the backyard! Enjoy!!!!!! ~ellen diane"
5,h-town classic,trae wrecked again! it's a classic. u can basically let the cd play from beginin to end. Keep doin yo thang trae. Free z-ro
1,Trae sucks,"Tight beats good production and concept, sorry lyrics and wierd flow, defintely sucks using zeros flow only zero can flow like that, Trae really needs to give it up and get a job"
4,"great album,but a few tracks left off.....","i was a little disappointed when i first got it and i noticed rain,and the truth are left off the slabed albumtheres 12 tracks off the slabed albumbut its still very very goodpollie pop has mastered the slow loud and bangin style and he does great work on trae's albumsthis album still has plenty great tracks....with swang,cadillac,no help,in the hood,restless,song cry,screw done already warned me,matter of time,dedication and real talk,really all the tracks are really goodlike i said i was interested in hearing the truth and rain slabed but still a very solid album...."
3,Functional but could be better,I ordered three of these parasols for a performance. They worked fairly well but we noticed that some were harder to open than others. There was too much tension on the shade. We didn't use them very much and now they are sitting in my closet but I think if we had used them more they would have started to fall apart. They are fragile!
3,Parasol,"I ordered this parasol to use for photography, to soften faces during bright sunlight. Does not work because I expected this parasol to be close to white instead of ivory (more like darker beige). The picture was misleading. I didn't return it since I'd have to pay for shipping."
3,Doesn't Block Sun,Bought this for my sister who always uses a parasol in the sun for coverage -- she sent it back because it didn't provide FULL sun coverage...she said it was attractive but didn't meet her needs. You decide.
2,do not reccomend,The handle was with kind of blue and pink dots - ugly.The main stick was bamboo - maybe - but was not one color but had two different colors mixed: white and brown - that do not look good.top of the parasol was finished with a big scrap of material that didn't cover how bad it was made.I was not happy with how the parasol looked like.
2,Looks cheap,Looks cheap. You get what you pay for. It does not look like in the Amazon product pictures. I will look elsewhere for a quality chinese parasol. Not worth it to send this back.
3,so so,"Rockport's previous style (no longer available? I was told..) I would give 5 stars, & has a snazzier look. In fact, still have a pair & use them. This model, for me, doesn't have the snug, firm support I feel in the other Rockport model. Cheaper? Less material? Less for more? Who knows."
2,GREAT BAND...VERY POOR RECORDING!,"This is one of the greatest progressive rock bands ever, even to this present day. I purchased this CD to get some of their music not available any where else, but was saddened that the sound quality is absoltuely terrible, I've heard bootlegs with much better quality. But to add one positive note... their playing and musicianship is fabulous! So recording 0, playing 10 stars! Buy this if you are a long-time devoted fan like me, but do not buy it for sound quality, you won't find it."
2,Cockatoos,"This book is no longer usefull.The info. is quite out dated foe example the author tells you that cockatoos need ONLY a seed diet. This was so 20 years ago. Pellets have been proven to be the diet with seeds (if fed) should be 10% of the daily diet. He does say feed fresh veggies,fruits etc.Also you are told about importing birds. This is against the law & has been so for YEARS.Not very much info. most info is only a few lines.under usefull literature & addresses he gives you names & addresses of magazines that are no longer in business. Over all the book is not worth the ink to print it."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"This book was OKAY. It didn't really talk much about how big they can get etc. Also, half of the book talked only about bredding which IS NOT the reason I bought it. I wanted general information on just SINGLE cockatoos not pairs!"
5,Just plain good!,"For a California Blues fan, this band puts the blues in texas. I gave this record 5 stars, because I know I'll be listening to this cd for years to come. Earlier cd's I'd have rated 7 or 8 stars. That's just how good Smokin Joe and B'nois King are....dynamite. This stuff is comfortable, sitting on the front porch kind of comfort. B'nois King has that wide vibrato and he can do it slow like the song says."
2,so bad its funny,"this movie is so cheesy, it trys to be scary but i garantee you will end up laughing your hardest at is craptasticness"
2,A B-movie true to it's description,"Boy, in an age of advanced technology to make movies more realistic, this movie showed NONE of that. I mean, boy, I can't believe I wasted money on this movie. The character MORPHED into a wasp? That was a waste of time. Very unrealistic looking wasp."
3,wish you did cheat,quuit crying over it you should have went to the club and got yours girl funny song it's cool though.
4,Playful pop-culture x-men,"This volume collects Joe Caseys first 6 issues on his run on Uncanny X-men with a sassy contemporary take on the X-Men. The main part of this trade is the 4 part Poptopia storyline about the young mutant Chamber getting a taste of the life of the rich and famous through an affair with a teen pop star. This quickly turns into a media scandal as dating a known mutant is a controversial career move for the Britney-copy. Ian Churchills colerful and playful art fit the story very well. On of the issues is drawn by a different artist in a much more moody but effectful style. The last story has the X-Men turning up at a mutant brothel (the 'X-Ranch') and one of the girls there, Stacy X, joining the X-Men"
3,uncanny x-men 394-399,"I'm not real sure what to say about this colletion. It's a middle of the road story. Not real great, but not real bad. It brings up some issues, but never really deals with them. The art is good except for #398. I guess the hard core fan would like it."
3,Hmm...if an xmen dated Britney spears,"Then this is what would happen. It was a kinda funny story, but totally pointless. Nice art though. I think the moral in this story is ""Don't date shallow girls and turn ur back on ur friends."" U deserved what happened to u in Decimation, Jono. lol ok maybe not...As for the supposed anti-americanism....WTF?How?Where? Do u even know what ur talking about?(I'm having so much fun reading r reviews though.)"
2,"silly, silly, silly","if you like tame, lame softcore, this is for you. no heat, nopassion, just a lot of mild sounds of lovemaking (like listening to amiddle-aged couple through a motel wall) and a lot of tedious ""mood"" bits. I felt more excited after listening to Dr. Laura than after listening to this."
5,Gershwin shines,"A cd with both ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and ""An American in Paris"", PLUS ""Cuban Overtures"" and a nice symphonic version of ""Porgy and Bess"", all that performed by a crowd that even I have heard of (I now practically nothing about classical music - I'm primarily a jazz fan)...The price is quite low for such a great content; if you're interested in Gershwin, I'm pretty sure you will not regret buying this CD. As is always the case with Gershwin, he can be considered, on one hand, interesting both to classical and to jazz audiences and, on the other hand, too classical for jazz fans and to populist/jazzy for the classical fans...There's probably no right or wrong attitude here - all I can say is that I'm a jazz fan interested in Gershwin's ""symphonic"" (or orchestral) work."
2,Beware of water resistent claim,"Love the style of this MP3 player, very gym friendly however when it came to a bit of water on the player, it died and was never usable again, went through 2 players and the same thing happened."
3,Just an OK MP3 player for the price,"I received this for christmas and I'm not thrilled with it. It can only be charged through a USB cord, with a computer, so if you're traveling without a computer, you're out of luck. The FM feature and stopwatch are great for a long run, but the headphones aren't that comfortable. I wasn't happy to have to use their clunky music software either."
2,CLUNKY,"This player epitomizes Sony's clunky proprietary style. From the 93-page user manual to the breath-takingly awful SonicStage software, it is difficult to enjoy this device.I purchased the player specifically for the ""music pacer"" function and was supremely disappointed to discover that it does not match your running cadence with a like-tempo song - that would be far too cool ... instead, this piece merely decides whether you are running or walking and then opens your pre-defined playlist of ""running"" songs or ""walking"" songs ... stupid."
3,"Fun player, terrible software","The player delivers in terms of shape, weight and user-friendliness, but you have to use the Sonic Stage software that it comes with (no easy sync-up with Windows Media Player, or click and drag files). The Sonic Stage software is not intuitive and a real pain in the neck--everything takes longer.On the plus side, the player is fun to go running with. The headphones it comes with have a pretty good sound, and I've already been complimented on the look of the thing."
3,Software does not work with Windows Vista!,"The player works great, it's the software that has problems. I first tried to install the software on my computer with Windows Vista and it didn't work! I had to install it on my older computer that had a standard version on Windows XP. The booklet says it will not work with some other versions of XP so be careful."
2,probably repeat,"Probably just repeating what others have said, but I love the music player itself, only Sony's proprietary format and required software take this from 5 stars to 2.I told myself I'd never buy another Sony product after the rootkit fiasco, but I did anyway and I regret it. Why couldn't they just go with the mp3 format and let the player be recognized as a flash drive? It takes me an hour to delete music and add back different music I want, when it should take less than 10 minutes, like with my old mp3 player. Personally I would buy another real ""mp3"" player that acts as a flash drive when interfacing with a computer."
4,Excellent Hardware - Horrible Software,"I am an avid runner, mountainbiker and climber, and have been using Walkmans and MP3 players since the early '80s. Still have my very first Sony Dolby B/C automatic reverse cassette player (what a blast that was - too bad it broke down about 15 years ago). That said, here are my comments:- Love the battery live, looks, minimal weight, but most of all, the EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY.- Hate the software. SONY, SONY, SONY, get rid of these guys (the guys that wrote the Sonicstage software)! Drag and drop compatible with Windows is all we want!- Forget about the included earbuds or any earbuds - buy Sennheiser. The sports PMX (green) sound awesome but unfortenately are inadequate in outdoor enviroments (cannot handle water), the PMX 60 are noisy for neighbors but are virtually indestructible.That said, enjoy everyone!!"
5,Stylish and useful,"i like this better than the i-p's and it works great,many features and long battery life, gets recharged from the usb connection on your computer."
3,For Gym only.,"I bought mine two weeks ago at Circuit City, I paid $139.99 before FL taxes.Pros:- Design,- Armband,- Easy to use while running,- Waterproof,- FM and- Weight.Contras:- Battery: does not last 18 hours. Using 192 kbits/s files you will get around 8 hours.- Display: Sony says that you can see it in angle, i don't agree. The display is too deep inside the glass, so it is hard to read it in angle.- Accessories: forget it! It does not exist, not even Sony provides accessories for this model.- Headset not waterproof,- Calories Counter, G sensor: It is far far far from being precise. I turn it off to save battery.P.S.: I had to return it because stop working in less than 2 weeks without a reason. Yesterday I got a new one at Circuit City.Conclusions: Do not buy it if you don't go to the gym often. Maybe it is a good choice for people that already have an IPOD and want to have one just to use in the GYM. Otherwise that are plenty of better options in the market."
4,Best for educational purposes.,"The twentieth edition of Goode's atlas of the world continues to be a standard for U.S.-educational purposes. The reference maps themselves are not too accurate and detailed, but they provide a reasonably well-balanced coverage of the world, with handy larger-scale inset maps for the more populous regions of each continent. There is an elaborate thematic section on a variety of topics about the world, the continents, and the United States in particular. This is supplemented by a very good statistical section, and the 30,000 entry index gazetteer contains a pronunciation guide for each entry, which is unique for a world atlas. Non-US buyers probably have better alternatives, but for school purposes for North America, this is a very good choice. The publication of this twentieth (!) edition illustrates the endurability of this work since 1922."
3,Maybe the best their is; but not good enough,"The atlas is U. S. centric even though the title is 'world atlas'. The map of the U. S. takes up about 25 pages, while the map of Italy, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslovia (formerly) take up 2 pages. And the spelling is unbelievable. Many of the place names are rendered in the native language instead of English, at least I assume so. North and South Korea, about the size of Kansas is shown at about 1/2 the size of Kansas. One normally buys a world atlas to learn about the world, not the U. S. A disappointment."
3,Above average of its kind,"This is a movie whose action takes place over one long night in Hollywood ,and it is essentially a prolonged chase movie exploring the sleazy underworld of the city .Season Hubley stars as a hooker-the archetypal ""tart with a heart"" -being pursued by her vicious pimp ,a sadistic psychopath named ""Ramrod "" .He in turn is being hunted by a vice squad cop .Ramrod is played -very well -by Wings Hauser and Gary Swenson does a good job as the cop .The movie is the tale of the hunt and it takes us over familiar territory ,populated by wierdos and freaks and slimeballs .It is nothing new and consideribg the milieu it reports on the picture is by no means violent or slimy itself .It manages to report on slime without smearing it all over the viewer .Indeed there is little explicit violence and there is more tease than sleaze on screen .It still manages to be taut ,tart and economical with the performance ,especially from Hauser ,lifting it a notch or two above the average ."
2,Trust Me: Keep Shopping!,"This book has two problems: First, it's out-dated and second, Mr. Patel writes in a sophmoric, anecdote-ridden style.If you're really looking for a practical guide to direct access service providers and markets, I suggest you contact the research departments of your local full-service brokerage firm and ask for industry reports on the subject. There's several firms that have published 20-65 page reports that explain every point of a direct access trade* from start-to-finish.Save your money, and pass on this one.* direct-access service providers, broker/dealer, clearing, markets & market systems, etc."
1,Direct Access My Hienie!,"in his first book, mr. patel tried to write something he obviously knew nothing about. which only proved he is destined for life on the streets. and that he smells."
1,Not cracked up to what is said.,"This product was labeled as a OS10 product, but it does not work. It is not a new program. It works only with Classic 9 Mac."
4,Brothers In Rhythm,be award that you may received two disc both with the same songs on them.One is label disc 1 and the other disc 2 but both have the disc 2 tracks on them. It would appear they had a production problem.
5,A Great Little Book,"Having just finished Lawerence James' ""Rise and Fall of the British Empire"", I felt like sticking with the Brits for a while, and picked up this great little book. Farwell's style is excellent and his humorous little anecdotes about life in the Victorian/Edwardian British Army make for fascinating reading. Not really a history book it covers the ""sociology"" of the British Army of the late 1800s-early 1900s. It was a stratified society, with gentleman officers and ""other ranks"" drawn from people who weren't so well bred. Not for the politically correct, though."
2,only basic-informations for beginners,"the ""Airport""-movies belonged together with ""Towering Inferno"" or ""The Earthquake"" to the jewels of disaster-movies. This softcover-booklet (...) brings some informations about the making of... of the 5 ""Airport""-films, but without going into deep. Fans won't really find new facts or informations. The quality of the pictures are absolutly lowest level like a backyard fanzine - but at least this fanzines are made with more love.See also ""Disaster Movies: the cinema of catastrophe"" by Stephen Keane"
4,Good Value MP3 Player,"I didn't have very high expectations since this MP3 player was under $30, however it has been very reliable and easy to use. A great starter MP3 player for a teenager or someone nearly 40 like me who is finally buying one."
4,I'm Very Pleased,"I Brought this for my nephew, and i'm glad to report there are no problems with this player. When i first got it i was testing it out at work, where i'm located in the basement of the building, i don't even get cell phone reception down here, but i was able to pick up radio stations with little static. I also love the lcd diplay, this was i good buy.The only thing is that it's sort of difficult to get back to the main menu when you are in fm mode."
1,A disappointment,"My mom purchased a Coby brand MP3 player about two or three years ago (an MP-C848), and so far it has performed really well. So when I decided to get an MP3 player for myself, I thought this one would be a good choice. It's a different model, but is about the same price as the one my mom bought, so I had high expections for it. I was soon disappointed.A recurring problem I had was that some of the files would play fine through the first half of the song, but as it got toward the end the player would suddenly cut to the middle of a different song. Sometimes deleting and re-adding the file would fix the problem, but then the player would start doing the same thing to a different song.Now, after only five months of moderate use, the play button has ceased to function.I recommend looking elsewhere if you want a player that's reliable."
4,MTD mower,"The spindle fit perfect, but the blades didnt fit the spindles. Send a e-mail to Damlow and they sended me back that they should work. They dont! The blades I got were #95-005 that fit a craftsman not a MTD. I should have recevied a #98-059 to work with my mower. Will I deal with Damlow again, I dont think so."
3,not bad,"this was a decent story. but i must say that the female lead was so dim whitted at times that it was not very believable. i mea c'mon, really. what 19 year old falls madly inlove with a 12 year old. i just dont find that to be very likely."
2,beware - boring!,I've bought this book after reading the great reviews written here - and now - barly a week after I've finished reading it - I can hardly remember what it was about - it was that boring! I usually read (good) historical romance books in one reading - it took me awhile to finish this one - but I kept reading till the end all the while hoping to understand what other readers liked about it so much. I still don't understand.
4,Fairly well done,"For a first-time book, Julia London did a magnificent job with Devil's Love. The characters were well developed and attractive. My only concern would be that Abigail was not quite as spunky as most other romance novel heroines, and that she was a little bit too mushy, gushy and soft for my liking. A little bit more spunk and fire between the two would have been welcome."
4,Devil's Love,"Being a new author I was reluctant to buy the book but when I started reading it, it was difficult to put down. Julia London is a VERY promising new author. I can compare her to my 2 favorites, Julie Garwood and Johanna Lindsey. Their books cannot be put down once you have picked them up either. I very much look forward to her next novels. I enjoy learning history facts when I am reading which shows that Julia London is doing her research before she puts the information into her novels. A must read if you like romance, comedy and history all rolled into one book. She has great characters and was I happy to see that she carried them through into her 2nd book. It's more like reading a continuation instead of a completely new book. But, if you read the 2nd book first, you were not lost and didn't realize that there was another book previous with some of the same characters. A must read!"
5,HER FIRST BOOK IS AS GOOD AS I HOPED,"I read Wicked Angel first and thought I finally found another Judith McNaught. Just to be sure, I read her first book Devil's Love. It wasn't as good as Wicked Angel, but it is still fantastic! J. London really reminds me of Judith McNaught (my favorite), and I am dancing on the ceiling since I found these books! I can't wait for the next one! Julia, please WRITE FASTER!"
4,nokia is back,"Bought this over christmas and am very satisfied. Beautiful big display plus another one on the outside...pops open and the keys are lit up in a gorgeous blue making it easy to use at night. The phone has the friendly nokia interface...maybe it's not as thick as the Razr's my friends have, but at least I can text message them...they can't figure out how to write me back. Function over form. I do hope though that in the future nokia figures out how to make their clamshell models more thin so they can fit in my pocket."
3,Missing Push To Talk Application,It doesn't come with the push to talk application... so it's supposed to be push to talk capable but without application... so you can't use it... why do they took away the push to talk application?? :(
5,The best Sony camera for family use,"I love this camera! I used this camera for a year now and in my opinion this is the best Sony camera for family use. It fits easily in a pocket, I just carry it in a ziplock bag to avoid getting it dirty. I carry this camera with me whenever I can, just to document bits of daily family life. I have other Sony cameras, but due to their size I always choose this one. The quality is excellent in good light condition, very good to document family moments. I also like the provided Handycam Station, I keep it on a table, put camera back when I'm home and thanks to this almost never forget to load batteries. I really can't complain about anything. Also, the photos quality are reasonable quality."
3,Wait for the remainder.,"This book is written for the layman. I found it superficial, but there are annotated suggestions for further reading."
5,Great Laptop,"I Have had this laptop for about two weeks , I love it . Clear picture , great sound . I am learning Vista , I have had no problems with it at all . I have had no problems with the computer , its fast and relible .Great as an entertainment laptop and great price for it . I love its look , has a nice disign to it . I would suggest it to anyone .I would say the only thing is you might want to look into getting the extended life battery for it ...laptops use a lot of power , battery last about two hours tops that comes with it . Still a great buy ."
4,Great Design! Poor time Battery life!,"I bought this laptop to use at home to replace a desktop computer, it have a great design and looks well, it comes with preinstaled Windows Vista Home Premium, but this software makes the computer works lazy.I would like to downgrade to Windows XP but I need to collect all drivers for Win XP.The 6 cell battery is not good because gives you 1 hour or less to work, you need to buy the 12 cell battery to get more time without AC."
4,Kids love it!,"I bought this for my 3 yr. old daughter to keep her entertained on an airplane trip. She loved it, and so did her older and younger brothers. It had a variety of activities to reinforce numbers and to associate them with quantities. I love it because it isn't messy and she can use other colors of dry erase markers with the book. The marker wipes off with a tissue, paper towel or an old sock."
4,Good product,"My 3 year-old daughter really likes to practice her numbers, and the product does indeed wipe clean after she is finished. The only downside is that the marker will stain furniture and/or clothes, so we have to supervise pretty closely when she is using this book. It is a very good product overall, however, and I will be purchasing the 'Letters' companion book as well."
5,I'm really glad i bought it,"This bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed. It feels so good knowing he's so close. Its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps. Oh yeah, and its really cute!"
4,Great for having baby in master bedroom without taking up too much room!,"I really like the size of this co-sleeper. It's perfect for having baby in our master bedroom without taking up a ton of room like a full-sized crib would do. Seems very stable and durable and should work until baby is about 6 months old and ready to move to her own room. Only complaint would be the leg extensions, which I needed because my bed is higher than average. They seem a little shaky and I worry about breaking them off when I have to move the sleeper."
2,Not Great,"This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself. Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper. We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it. I tried to put extra padding which worked ok, but still not great. 3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed. I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet. Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months."
3,Enjoyable beach read,"I wasn't impressed nor disappointed in this book. It is a cute and very sweet collection of short Christian fiction stories. Absolutely nothing shocking or soul-baring in any of them. To me, they are the type of story that just makes you feel better about the world. The book would make a good library check out as something to enjoy in your backyard or on the beach."
5,"Mind-Blowing, Paradigm-Shifting Fun","Sly intellectual stimulation. In an age where ""non-fiction"" books and cable channel documentaries purport to reveal the secrets of the pyramids and other ancient exotica, here comes a fictional archeologist to outshine them all in a hugely entertaining spoof. Now we learn that America's monuments on the National Mall are astronomically aligned to the stars and will ""lock"" with their celestial counterparts at a date foreseen by the Founding Fathers. The cheesy tone, the deadpan delivery, everything works beautifully. Best of all, Professor Yeats packs his secret government white paper with so many absurd, real-world facts about the Founding Fathers, the Freemasons and American architecture, that you really begin to wonder. The zoom-able, digital maps from the National Archives alone are worth the ... price. A fantastic tribute to American history and the history of conspiracy."
2,Gave me a UTI,I tried this product and I got a UTI. I stopped it after a week and waited a month. I then tried again and I got another UTI where I needed to go to the doctors for medicine. After that I threw out the box.The first day I did get jitters but after that I was fine.I didn't lose any weight on it but probably because I only used it for a week at a time.
4,Good Product,I lost 7 pounds while on these pills. They did not make me jittery although I started off with one pill two times a day for the first two days and then doubled up as directed. I was very pleased with this product. It was not a miracle worker but brought up my confidence and motivation to work out harder and longer.
1,This product made me exhausted,"I was very excited to try this supplement. I was hoping for help with weight loss. But going into this with a realistic view, and having read all the reviews on here- the thing I was expecting was to have a bit more energy, even to be a little jittery.NONE OF THAT HAPPENED.Each day I took this product I felt like I had not slept for days. I would only take doses in the morning. When I took it, I felt lethargic and exhausted. I do not understand why. I am going to contact the company and see if they will replace or refund for the product."
1,ehh..,Ive been using this for 2 weeks now..and haven't lost a pound..i work out everyday and cut the sweets..all i wanted was a little boost but this doesn't seem to work for me! On the bright side it got delivered SUPER fast..
5,Excellent CD,I have search all over for Diego's music for a particular song. No one carried any of his music. I was happy to finally find it. Add on fast delivery time ..... even better. I haven't taken this cd out of my player since. Thanks so much.
3,Hmmm. For thirty bucks?,"I have been shopping for baskets a lot recently. Trying to find the right size, color and quality for the right price. I thought I had done it with these, but I was a little disappointed. They kind of have some orange tones in them and are not a very deep color. The picture implies ""espresso"" right? It's not. They look okay, but feel pretty cheap for the price. Thirty bucks for what seems like a nickel's worth of materials. Also, when you open the box, they have a weird, chemical smell from the dye, which, thankfully dissipates. But, here's the thing- they are still cheaper than most that you can find in any store these days and the measurements are correct in the description. They are not great, definitely not the best looking, but they are functional, usable, little guys and I just ordered another set to match the ones I already have. ;)"
3,Good Quality,"I needed some durable, cube-shapped baskets to fit in my narrow, shelf tower for my bathroom. All the baskets I found in my local stores would not fit because they were either rectangle-shaped and too long, or square-shaped and too short. The Winsome baskets are square baskets that are a little more wide than they are long. I also liked how tall they were. Office files would fit in them perfectly. The weave is very tight and stiff, and the wire frame is strong. Overall, these baskets are very durable. The only thing I didn't like about this product was the price. It also took almost a month for me to receive this product after I had paid for them. The color is exactly the same as the picture."
5,Sturdy Baskets,Purchased this set of baskets to go with the display cabinet. It's a nice touch and looks good with the cherry finish furniture we have. These are sturdy baskets at a good price.
1,these are junk,The picture and description make them seem like they are something they are not: strong heavy duty and attractive. They are wrapped in a very thin skinny wicker with pieces poking out everywhere. They do not seem like they will withstand the treatment they will get from my kids. Plus they look like something from the dollar store not amazon :( dissappointed
3,Nice Baskets,They are nice baskets but they should be alittle bigger in length for practical reasons. Alittle Pricey for quality.
5,Great baskets for the money,"These baskets arrived promptly and are just as advertised. They are built on a square wire frame, sturdy and uniform. I bought six and have them lined up on shelves hiding/organizing clutter - they look nice and do what I wanted them to do."
3,Not what I thought I was getting,"OK. It's at least partially my fault for not reading the description closely enough, but please note: THESE BASKETS ARE NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD FILE FOLDERS. Which makes them kind of an excess purchase for me since I'm trying to set up a filing system. But if you're buying them to store odds and ends, then yes, they would be OK. As for me, I'll try to adapt some baskets I have that are large enough for folders and use them on the shelf I ordered to go with these baskets."
2,Quality & color are OK but not great.,"Bought these baskets about 2 years ago. The quality and color were nice then! But I have recently order 2 more and unfortunately the quality and color has diminished. The 2 recently purchased baskets did not match each other in color. One looked stained and the other looked painted. The quality of them didn't match either. One had loose and sloppy weaving around the top. What happened to there quality control? Sorry I don't recommend these baskets. And for the diminished quality, I have to say they are overpriced."
5,Just what was needed,"The baskets were exactly as described. I needed themto get control of clutter in my linen closet as wellas pantry. Since both have fairly narrow doors and arevery deep, it was difficult to find just the right baskets.These are good quality for the price and their straightsides makes maximum use of available space.The quality is absolutely sturdy for the price and thetwo handles on each baskets makes them easy to pull inand out."
2,Wished I'd listened to a previous reviewer,"As a previous reviewer had noted, these baskets have a funny, musty odor. I am using them in a closet, and the closeness of the area makes the smell worse. I have sprayed with Lysol spray several times with no luck. I have had them for a month now, hoping the odor would dissipate, but it hasn't. For the money, I am disappointed in the quality of the baskets...the construction is just okay and there are some rough edges (they don't look like the picture). I could have done better at WalMart. Very disappointed."
5,PERFECT,JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR AN OPEN SHELVING UNIT I PURCHASED. RIGHT SIZE AND COLOR IS AS SHOWN IN PICTURE.
4,As Described,"The boxes are of solid quality and look nice in my office. I had hoped that they would fit some dividers and papers I had, but they are just a little too small. I'm still glad that I bought them, however."
5,Noggin Rules!,"Fast Christian punk rock. It took me awhile to get into their music, but now they're one of my fav. bands. Nice Christian lyrics, fast paced drums, fast guitar riffs, and awesome bass melodies. If you're a bassist you might should get this just to check out the style! Freakin' catchy."
2,Not so good,"This Cd isn't as good as I hoped for it too be. The stronger point of this Cd is the half desecent music. The lyrics on some song really really REALLY stink. Not only are most of the songs cheesy, they're short and some of the them are almost just... ANNOYING! The better songs on the cd are Tommorow's gonna hurt, My own few words, robots (ok),Greyman (thats because I like cats and this song actually isn't that bad) and Noggintoboggan3, (ok). I wouldn't recomend buying this CD at all, unless, of course, you really want too..."
3,Aloe Vesta Antifungal Ointment - 2 oz Tube,I thought it should have worked a lot better than it did. I was disappointed that during the lifetime of the tube no changes were seen on my skin.
3,does it work?,Ive used this product for a month and my feet seem to be better but not cured.Im not sure if I stop using it if the fungus will come back.Just not sure yet.The downfall of this product is the smell after a work day.If possible wash feet a couple of times a day to prevent this.
5,News of the Day: Richard Rocks!,"Finally, a children's CD that me and my husband can enjoy. My 2 year old throws her hands up in the air and requests ""Up Above my Head""(""bove' my hea"")constantly. Great sound quality, great singing and fun tunes. I find myself singing it all the time. Very happy with this purchase...can't wait for the next one!"
5,Great Songs for Kids,"I have a 5 year old and he loves ""Gimme Gimme"". For one thing, the music is immediately memorable. He started singing ""Hello, My Friend"" after the first time he heard it. He also loves the idea of ""News of the Day"" and waits to hear what it is. Richard Younger has put together a wonderful selection of music and his voice is very inviting. You can tell the kids that are in his music class love it. We want more!!!"
1,Piece of junk!,"Same thing as others experienced. Handle falls down. I own 3 Parisa faucets, purchased in 2005. Had to replace all 3 cartridges. Now kitchen one is doing the same again. What good is a lifetime warranty if they won't answer the phone. They say they are having a high call volume every time I call. Either lots of people need warranty service, or they have 1 employee. I think they are hoping we will just go away. This company is owned by Black and Decker, another cheap product company. I am considering buying a new faucet at the store, then removing the cartridge and replace it with my bad one. Then return it to the store as defective, the store returns it to PP for credit, and PP is stuck with it. That is what they deserve, and maybe if they get hundreds that way, they might fix it, but probably not. No telling why they cannot ask their Chinese suppliers to make a better product. Bottom line, don't buy from PP."
3,"Drippy, they charge for shipping.","I purchased and installed this faucet a few years ago. It has been leaking from the switch in the head since as long as I can remember. I finally decided to call them about it. They agreed to send me a new head no questions asked, except there is a five dollars shipping charge for 5+ days. I have to say I find that really annoying and will not buy another faucet from this company."
2,Problem with cartridge assembly,"I purchased this unit (534-70SS) 15 months ago, and the first problem occured about 10 months after I purchased it. The water would be constantly dripping slowly when the faucet was turned off, and as days went by the water dripped more and more. I called them, and they sent me the cartridge assembly, but after replacing it, the handle wouldn't stay up when I turned the water on at slow flow setting. I called again, and they were nice enough to send me a brand new retail packaged unit without shipping cost to me. I replaced it, and it worked for the past 5 months, and now the handle again wouldn't stay up at low flow setting. I guess I have to live with it until another problem surfaced. It came with life time warranty, but what good is it if I have to replce the cartridge assembly (or the whole thing) every few months."
4,Nice styling,"This is basically a very nice product. It looks good and is easy to use. It is lighter than I expected, which makes it feel somewhat cheap in the hand. Faucet broke within the first week. It took me awhile to figure out how to contact the manufacturer. Then I was on hold for over a half hour. However, once I got through it was effortless. They sent me a replacement part no questions asked...and I got that very quickly. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase."
2,"Price Pfister Poor Quality, Poor Customer Service","I bought this faucet in 2005 thinking Price Pfister was a better quality brand. The mechanism never worked as smoothly as I thought it should have, but recently began really being hard to work. In a matter of days, it basically quit completely. The major home do-it-yourself center I bought it at did not have the replacement cartridge. I called Price Pfister and they will send a replacement, but I have to pay shipping and handling and it will take 7-10 days. So I am without a kitchen sink for that time! Or I could pay extra for expedited shipping. So for the price of shipping they have lost a customer. I wouldn't recommend buying anything Price Pfister."
1,Not Too Good,"I bought this faucet 4 years ago and I'm considering replacing it soon. I am going on my 3rd cartridge - which they send for free. Aside from replacing the cartridge frequently - which is a headache to deal with - I do not like the design.I like the concept of a pullout with a one-handle design. My main complaint is the design of the spray-head and tubing that runs to the water lines. If any watet is present (from hand transfer)on the spray-head, it tends to run down the tubing and onto the cabinet floor below the sink. I place a small bowl under the sink to catch these drips, which helps, but I don't feel like I should have to do this for a nice faucet.I am now more informed about design and know what to look for next time in a faucet."
2,"Low Flow, Won't Stay On","I too am disappointed in this faucet. We remodeled the kitchen and bought this faucet which matches nicely with our other stainless steel items. But the flow is very low (yes we have plenty of pressure coming in), and as noted by others, the faucet shuts itself off if you try to have it on any less then full. We're shopping for a replacement now."
1,Broken & Without a Kitchen Sink,"We bought this product about 15 months ago. Worked great for about 14 months, then the spay adjuster/selector on the bottom started to leak. Being the procrastinator I am I didn't look into getting it fixed because the holidays were coming up, and figured it could wait a little while. Now the whole selector piece has come out & as a result the sink is no longer able to be used!!! We'll see what customer service at the local store says, this unit is no longer available locally, so I'm hoping for a credit tward a new brand."
4,Corgi Approved!,"My 4yo Cardigan Welsh Corgi loves these things, and when they stopped carrying them at PetSmart, I had to go here for them. They seem to be made of good ingredients, and they're the right size for him. Plus, he loves them and that's what's important!"
1,Don't waste your money,"There is nothing in this book you can't find better explained somewhere else. In fact, you should know a fair amount about Italian cooking before you try any of the recipes, because otherwise who knows what you'll end up with. Not that there are very many recipes; instead you get lots and lots of relatively vapid filler in the guise of homespun advice and memories by family members. ""Sirio Speaks,"" but who cares? For this much money, stick to Lidia Bastianich. You'll get better food and it will turn out well, too."
3,Hmmm...why no metafile coverage?,"Frankly amazing to me that in a Win graphics book of this size and, in other respects, scope and excellence, that neither ""metafile"" nor ""enhanced metafile"" is in the index, nor is there anywhere else a mention that I could find. Consistent with this, all of the metafile-related GDI functions are missing as well---hardly a ""comprehensive treatment of the Windows GDI"" as stated in the Introduction. It seems to me that this rather large omission deserves at least a tiny explanation or justification somewhere, but there isn't one...instead it appears we are pretending that metafiles are not part of the Win2K GDI. A bit surreal!DLS"
3,Not for very loud sound.,I bought these for the Rollex 24 hour endurance race. They were not very good. The foam takes a long time to expand in your ear. Longer in cool temperatures
4,Excellent,"This is not the first good book that Krane did make, he had many before!This book is excellent for any beginner wishing to study or know something about nuclear physics, but the level of the text somehow is advanced that I might say it is for MSc. students more than Bachelor, but everyone can do well at least just for reading to satisfy the interest. It has some questions after each chapter, but no answers at the back, but the author tries (as I felt in some questions) to make you make your own impression and thought about some topics even though you are wrong and makes you sense the real environment of the labs and how data are analyzed. After all, it is a good book indeed."
4,A beautiful album,"This is the Ange album you should get after ""Au dela du delire"". It is full of beautiful melodies and has kind of an intimate sound, like if the guys were playing the songs only for you. Get it."
2,Alone Together,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I read a review for it in my local paper and was so intrigued I pre-ordered it at least a month before it became available. I checked my mailbox each day and when it finally arrived I read it and looked at the pictures for maybe 30 minutes. I'm not sure how I missed this, but I was expecting a life story, not a breif narrative with photos. The photos were lovely, but as the narrative, simply left more questions than were answered. What a great book this could have been!"
2,alone together,This is not really a book - just a pamphlet. Perhaps the style is meant to follow the simple life the kellams led. You will not get many facts re. the kellams and in fact it turns out that the house was tipped upside down and presumably put back enough to take these photos.Having said all this it is still a poignant look into one couple's life on an isolated island. I think i would wait and buy it used.......
3,broken piece,"there was one broken piece when we received this dinnerware, as a replacement for the earlier dinnerware that had two broken pieces. between the two sets we had three broken pieces."
2,From the sublime to the ridiculous,"What a schizophrenic book. The first half-- following its hapless anti-hero through a series of escalating mortifications--is a great, funny read--Chalmers possesses a real mordant wit. However, the minute our hero steps foot onto the super-heated tarmac of deepest, darkest Central Florida, the book spirals into a surreal gumbo of tooth-breaking violence, tin-eared dialogue, and every ""Suhthun"" stereotype known to man. Being a Floridian myself, the factual discrepancies rife in this book were jarring and distracting. How disappointing."
2,"Violin Making Step by Step By Henery A Strobel,","This book I found frustrating. At a quick glance it seems to be giving me information, but when I actually try to follow advise I come up short. It seems you my need to buy all his books to get real information out of this book. I will say I did find some useful information but was overall unhappy and was left with the feeling like a kid in a candy store with no money. Look and smell but nothing to eat."
2,BE CAREFUL WITH THESE!!,"I ordered these very attractive trays because of the low price and the free shipping. Upon receiving them I was quite disappointed to find they are virtually useless. The trays are not deep enough, and the surface is so smooth that everything just slides right off at the slightest movement. It is not worth the money or the trouble to return them, so I am stuck with them! Unless you are planning to use these trays in some stationary manner, save your money."
4,Good Drummer Boy,This is one of the top 3 versions of The Little Drummer Boy I've found so far. arrived & played ok.
5,The complete system,This worked great. Pulled the code off the car told me exactly what was wrong and for a fee told me what I needed to replace to fix the problem. No more light and my car is running much better.
1,M.Heeczeg,completely dis-satisfied. does not link with either of my pc's most of the time. took too long to recieve the product and customer supplort did not help at all with pc link up.
5,Very good scanner,"This scanner is very good. Display live data very well with my Dodge Caravan 1997. I could see RPM, Load, MAP, temperatures and more while driving."
4,equus 3130,Awsome product.Very helpfull in diagnosis. I would like to see more transparence to the online service diagnostic capability offers related to this product. The add does not mention that the offer comes only on subscription or per fee service only.Otherwise prompt service.
1,"Good Product, Poor Support","Although I was impressed by the features, they don't mean squat if you can't get your questions answered.Submitted an email request and did not receive an answer, so I called. I did in fact get connected with a support member but unfortunately the individual was having a bad day and made sure I was aware of it, the response was less than stellar and not worth pursuing with the attitude I encountered. I had another question so thought I would try email support again...no reply to date.Bottom line...I wish I had purchased an Actron scanner, features not as good but their support is awesome (several friends said I'd be sorry with Innova and I am)."
3,"Easy to use, better than most, but could still have more","I needed a scanner to diagnose a 2000 Cadillac Catera. Repair shop said they weren't getting ""proper"" trouble codes. I used this to one, find the problem, and diagnose subsequent issues. But I did need some assistance on the Internet as both the tool and the way the car's computer work prevented me from getting complete details. Overall I don't think I could have found a better product. This tool was capable of an additional level of communication that $20-$50 scanners couldn't do, but it didn't have the full reach of $1,000 commercial products. (Don't know why my repair shop had worse results.) If you need such a tool I highly recommend it, but be aware it won't diagnose the problem for you, more like assist you. i also understand some parts stores will hook your car up to their tool for free, so try that first."
4,excellent product,This scanner is excellent. It works on every car I have plugged it into. It is very easy to use and response time is faster than the big expensive ones. Sometimes though it will show pending codes as stored codes when the check engine light is not on. Every thing else is great just wish it read abs codes a great buy for the money. The exact same scanner in the store is double.
5,Ease of Use,"This product work really good. All you have to read the manual and it should self explain the use. I took me like 10 minute to learn how to use the device. Even though it gave you an error code, you are going to have to do the research yourself."
5,invaluable if you work on your car.,"I found this on a gold bar special for a incredible price. It's intuitive, plug and play and seems well made. It recognized my 98 Chrysler Sebring and my 06 Jeep Liberty with no problems. The only complaint is the interface between the scanner and the pc. It's really not a problem but I don't have a 9 pin RS-232 serial port on my laptop. I purchased a Trendnet TU-S9 USB to serial Converter cable, installed the driver and was ready to transfer data via my USB port. Very cool! No more trips to Autozone for finding out what the check engine light means!"
4,Works great,"It works great, i would buy it again... the only thing that sucked is that the O2 sensor test didnt work with my Ford F150"
5,EQUUS 3130 INNOVA,"IT WORK GOOD , IT PIN POINT PROBLEM ACCURACY , BUT YOU NEED KNOWLEDGEABOUT CAR MECHANIC TO UNDERSTAND . THE PRICE IS GOOD ONLY HALF OFSOME LOCAL STORE. IT SAVE MONEY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU CAN FIX CHECK ENGINELIGHT ON BY YOURSELF"
4,"Great Diagnostic Tool but, Dont Forget to Pick Up a Serial to USB","This is a great diagnostic tool to have in any garage but if you want to use the ""extras"" then you'll have to connect it to a PC which is a 9-pin serial connector. Most newer PCs today no longer have this connector so if you want to connect this up then you'll have to pick up a serial-to-USB adapter. I just wished it was supplied with the this unit.""4 stars"" because of having to buy the seperate adapter otherwise it would of been an easy ""5 star item"""
5,Excellent Value,"I have had other scanners that cost considerably more, that did a lot less. I researched just about every site on-line and hands down Amazon had the best value on the identical Equis product."
5,Innova Equus 3130,Have only used it once and an one car but it is easy to use and does everything it's supposed to do. I highly recommend it.
5,why did you choose this rating,why did you choose this ratingdemaciodo bueno este scanner llego todo bien el vendedor 100% confiable muy contento com mi compra
4,Good product,"It satisfied my needs, helped me get the info I needed and I don't have to call the mechanic and pay"
2,USB cable NOT included!,I ordered this unit by the description and the photos that said that the usb cable is included. When I received it it came with a serial cable. 9 pin connector that none of my computers sport. I must have received old stock as a serial cable was the norm several years ago. With out the usb I will not be able to update. I do not want to have to purchase an adapter.
2,Very selective cars,"Bought this for my 98 4Runner and it worked just fine on that. Then tried to read a code on a Kia and it would not register at all. Well that was a year ago. Now both of those cars are gone and I have a 00 F250 Powerstroke Diesel 7.3. Does not work on this vehicle. If I would have known that it was selective on vehicles, I would have never bought it."
4,Equus 3130,"For those diy'ers this is a great mony saver, it already paid for itself. Too bad it only gives generic codes for european cars."
1,Not what you expected,"I purchased this to help keep a check on my Toyota. I discovered after I received the Item that it would not work with my vehicle as it was not manufactures for the USA. There is no mention on the item description that it is only for vehicles manufactured for the USA of Canada. All that is said is that it is for American Manufactured, Asian and European Cars. This is mis-information if not anything else, I am now stuck with as useless scanner/code reader, unless as the INNOVA technician told me I buy a car manufactured for North America. No offer made to refund me my money.Just remember, if your vehicle was not made for the North American market IT WILL NOT WORK! So do not buy it. Your money will be wasted."
4,"Good product, great data","This scanner gives you everything you need to help diagnose problems with your car. Unlike the cheaper scanners that only give you a code, you can view real time data and see the effects of changes you make to confirm the operation of sensors and computer controls. The only reason I give it a 4 insead of 5 is that a couple of times, I plugged it in and the screen just went white. I couldn't reset it for about 10 minutes but it seems ok now."
3,user of code scanner,"The diagnostic code scanner function exactly as it expected. It is a useful tool for whowever has a problem. The only thing it does link to the PC. The manufacturer provided a cable connection to the PC and did not work, when I called the techniqual support about this problem they advice me to purchase a usb cable that costed me $36 dollars and still did not work. So I am disappointed to pay for extra feature that it did not work which is a waist of money. Buying a lower grade model would of been sufficiant.Equus 3130 Innova Diagnostic Code Scanner with Live, Record and Playback Data Capability for OBDII Vehicles"
1,"Overpriced, way overpriced ABS upgrade, old technology, You can buy cheap software for your droid that works better","Do not waste your money. These do not even have a USB port. They have an archaic serial port and you must buy an expensive serial adapter for your laptop. The ABS upgrade is priced ridiculously at $100 and you cannot even install it without buying a special adapter. You can buy an actron scanner that does ABS for less. Or literally for $4.99 software and $13.99 for the bluetooth adapter, you could use your droid to scan everything but ABS. The droid software is more straight forward, easier to use and does real time date which you can CUSTOMIZE. I am sorry I wasted my money on this relic. Look up Torque Pro on Android and you will see what I mean."
1,USDM only,This scanner only works on USDM cars and not JDM cars. The advertisment says all european and asian cars it should be USDM european and asian
1,Old days electronics,"This is the year 2009. However, the Equus 3130 has a serial PC cable on it. The last year I saw any new laptop computer that had a serial data port was 2000. Everything these days has USB. Secondly, if Innova allowed its products to be updated by use of a web browser, then buyers would not be forced to use Microsoft Windows. Wow, being able to use a Macintosh or a PC! What a forward thinking concept, only in existence since last century. Clearing (that is, resetting) codes should be a one-button operation but sadly is not. Is there any technical or engineering employee in this company under the age of 30? I'll bet Innova management has a cracker barrel in the board room."
4,Good so far,I bought this scanner as a Xmas gift for my dad. He's tested it on his GM Pickup and my Mom's Pontiac. It sync'd up with the cars and worked as advertised.The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is we haven't had to use it for any serious diagnostic purposes yet - and that's why I bought it.
1,Bad experience,Purchased and paid for scanner. Waited for two weeks for the scanner to be delivered. Five days after the scheduled delivery date I verified tracking number with USPS they said they had been notified item would be shipped but item had not been shipped. Contacted Amazon and money was refunded. All this time my car sat broke down in the yard. I went to Harbor Freight and bought a compatible scanner for HALF THE PRICE of the Amazon scanner. Had the car repaired and running great in less than 30 min. after getting the scanner home.
4,It's fast.,"It boots up fast and gets the codes out quick. Pretty limited on live data, but it gets you started."
1,old firmware or new?,"Apparently, you can't update the firmware on this unit. The update feature in the software directs you to a link to the website for the update "".bin"" file, but no such file exists. I've looked for hours to no avail. Also, serial ports are obsolete - this scanner should have a USB interface for connecting to your PC. I had to purchase a separate usb-serial adapter, which is an extra needless step..."
4,Works fine,"Since I have been a tech for 38 years I have an edge,I have used many scan-tools of different makes.This scan-tool is simple to use,it doesn't support diagnoses of codes but displays all needed codes to repair a problem.You will need a service manual to properly diagnose fault codes.I like it as it gives important data to properly see componants at their actual values and when you make needed repairs you can see the repaired/replaced componant read proper values."
4,Great Product with Great Service from Amazon,"I've had this product for four days and it has already paid for itself. I was able to retrieve and clear the diagnostic code from my 2005 vehicle without a problem. This product autolinks to your car, establishes the correct protocol, and returns the DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) almost instantly. Taking the vehicle to the mechanic every time the car's check engine light comes on is not only expensive in terms of money, but also time. My specific problem let me be aware of a sensor that I could fix myself...without tools. This tool is a gem to have in your garage for OBD-II vehicles. As far as my experience with buying through Amazon, this particular tool was $30 cheaper than buying it through my local auto parts house. And...with Amazon Prime I had it in two days with FREE shipping...can't beat it!"
1,Aged Technology,"Please be aware of a few facts about this item. It only operates on FAT formatted disks which leaves out most of the larger capacity portable USB storage media. It only works using USB 1.1, a 12 megabit/sec transfer rate. (The current standard, USB 2 has a 400 megabit/sec transfer rate). I purchased it to transfer images from my camera card backup drive to a portable DVD drive. This unit fails to recognize either unit. The product, delivered 3 days ago (APR 2007) has a sticker on the bottom stating it was manufactured November 2004.I'ts possible someone may have a use for this item, but for most consumers with relatively modern portable storage devices this unit is not useful in the slightest."
3,Good + Bad = Just okay,"I did not like the Sun Salutations in the beginning of this workout. They were too fast, so that when they were done, I was not even warmed up. It reminded me of MTV Power Yoga, which I hated.However, I really liked that there were a whole standing and then seated sequences. I aleady have them, though. The seated sequence was basically the same as is on Yoga Shakti, and the standing sequence the same as the Nicki Doane video Ashtanga Yoga Beginner's Practice (but shorter and therefore less good).So, if you don't have any such videos, this is good because it was cheap and they talk in Australian accents. (They say ""Let's move into THE up dog."") If you have a healthy-sized collection, though, it wont really add anything."
3,Love Abba!!!,"I bought this book because I knew so little about the lives of these artists.But I was a bored by the repititious explanations of Agnetha's unhappiness athaving to travel, her obsessive relationship with her children. (or so I thought)Anyway the author could have left out a lot of details. It seemed he gave the chronilogical history of their journey in too much information.However, I did find the four bios good at the beginning. and the pictures were good too. So if you want to know more about them. It's here."
1,ABBA story,"The book is very well written. It is the detail description of somehow mysterious pop group, which is placed just after Elvis and Beatles, as far as the number of sold records is concerned.You will not find here something completely unexpected. Insteed, you will find a lot of details which are not easly available.So, for anybody who is a real fan of ABBA - this book is a must !"
1,Poor software and display,"I used this device almost daily for 2 months, then sold it for the following reasons. First, the SonicStage software never worked properly. I installed about 100 symphonies at one time without any difficulty, but on several different occasions, whenever I tried to add a single new symphony to the unit, the software could not find the 100 already installed even though they were all present according to the unit and any could be played. Each time this happened I was forced to re-initialize the hard drive, erasing the symphonies already on the unit and requiring that they all be added again. Second, the display has no backlight, making it almost impossible to see the display in daylight. I often had to cover the screen with my hand to see it. Another complaint (admittedly minor) is that, if I turned the unit off while it was playing a particular work and later turned it back on, the unit would resume playing that work. I regretted buying the unit and got an Ipod Nano instead."
2,Long delayed follow-up to the NW-HD5 comes up short,"Following the disastrous move by Sony to stick XCP spyware on their Sony/BMG cds, I had decided NO MORE SONY. However, because their previous hard-drive based player (NW-HD5) produced the best sound I'd heard, I admit to being anxious to see what they'd come up with next. Unfortunately, Sony decided style was more important than boosting capacity as this model is a relatively paltry 8 GB, and that is just not enough. The NW-HD5 was 20 GB. I was expecting more this time, say 30-60 GB. If Sony had been SMART enough to heed this, I would have ordered one. I am disappointed. However, kudos for design. Sony is usually cutting-edge in that regard (with the exception of their AWFUL remotes). NO SALE, Sony. Try AGAIN!!"
3,Samson 6 in 1 Juicer,"Hi, I bought a Samson 6 in 1 Electric Wheatgrass Juicer on Jun. and only start to use it at the end of Aug. The Juicer works fine, except each time I press the REV key, the fuse got burnt (twice), I can also feel the engine became warm after use the machine for a few minutes. Something seems wrong with this Juicer, what shall I do with it? Please advise, thanks!"
4,Schocked to see that i'm the first....,"to review this excellent but underrated disc. Middle of Nowhere & Just to Dream shoulda been big hits, hell all the songs are good. Gina Schock (of the Go-Go's) & Vance Degeneres (yes Ellen's Brother) have crafted a great pop record, too bad the record company messed with it up by adding oh-so-80's syths. Still worth checking out."
4,House of Schock review,"Gina Schock's first and only solo CD. Best known for her work as the drummer in the Go-Go's, in 1988 Gina formed her own band with Vance DeGeneres (Ellen's Brother). Together they wrote the entire album. Songs like Middle of Nowhere and Never Be Enough should have been hits. When I listen to 'This Time' Gina seems to speak of the Go-Go's break-up- ie 'This Time no one else decides for me, This Time'.Any one of these songs could have been recorded by the Go-Go's. It is all rock-pop. In an interview to support the record, Gina noted she was 'No Whitney Houston', but she carries the record superbly. A must have for any Go-Go's fan."
2,"Buy a size larger, and don't plan on wearing them long.","Well, first, the pants run small, I always wear the same size pants, and these were a bit tight. The biggest problem, though, was that the pants wore through on the seat after only wearing them about 8 times. I work in an office, and sit at a chair all day, and the pants wore through right on the right seat pocket! I'd imagine it's from sitting down all day, but still, I've never had a pair of pants do that before, or since. I'm pretty easy on clothes, I've got jeans and other khakis that I originally bought in college. I won't be buying any more IZOD products."
4,Nice khaki,These IZOD khaki pants fit very well and are a nice pair of pants. They are comfortable without being too baggy. I will probably order some more.
4,Watch the Metrix fit!,"Received the pants promptly. Pleated with cuffs, they look great. I like the material and the look. The issue is with the 'rise' which is the distance (or amount of material) between the waist and crotch. The Izod Metrix fit info says the rise of each size coordinates with the inseam length. In Izod's case I don't know if the rise lengthens or shortens as the inseam gets larger.(??) I couldn't find any Izod info that states it. In my case these are 36'' waist by 32'' inseam. I am 6' 2''. The pants have a shorter rise than I would like. Standing up they are OK but sitting down they ride up at the crotch and are bit snug.Just FYI."
1,They get worn out FAST,My pleated Khakis started showing wear after I wore them twice. There is noticeable wear on the back pockets and even the pleats that run down the front.
5,"Perfect fit, better than the new Dockers.","I use to purchase Docker's all the time because of the quality, recent purchases of Docker pants have shown that the company is greedy, charging a high price for a poor quality item. I decided to make a switch and try some IZOD pants.These pants fit perfect for me, the quality of the material is what Dockers used to be and at a much lower cost to me.A three way win.No more button popping, no more inaccurate lengths in their sizing chart (Dockers), no more thin easy rip issues."
2,Creases gone after one lukewarm washing,"These might be ""wrinkle resistant"" but it would have been nice if the crease ""wrinkles"" remained after washing. These are not the old IZOD quality."
5,"Very impressed, nice fit, correct sizing and comfortable",This was the first time a purchased dress pants online and I was a little weary. The pants arrived in good condition and fit great. After the first washing they did not shrink or wrinkle which surprised me sense they are 100% Cotton. I will be shopping for my clothes online from now on because I wear an unusual size (38W x 29L) and most stores that carry my sizes only have them in limited selections. Sorry local stores but I will be purchasing my pants online from now on.
5,class requirement,bought it cause required for class don't really have much to say about it...i guess we'll see how i feel as class goes
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Ernest Angley was certainly an interesting preacher, but had definitely risen to the level of his incompetence when he tried his hand at novel-writing.I won't quibble over the theology too much, but suffice it to say, Angley has no conception of symbolism. EVERYTHING in the Bible, is literal to him.At the moment of the rapture, the faithful hear, ""Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him!"" So God is still working out of the King James Version, eh?Try to count the number of times in the book that ""great fear seizes (someone's) heart.""Another example of bad writing: the narration tells us about a character who is damned, ""All Jim cared about was Jim.""It does get entertainingly funny, however, when we enter the torture chamber. Believe me, Angley doesn't hold back there."
3,It gets the point across,"This book deals with the Rapture to the end of the Tribulation.It was first written back in 1950, but its message is as validas then.On a negative point the writing style is not very good andthe characters tend to be one dimensional. They also tendto be overly emotional and downright hysterical. (Often annoyingly so!)Another thing is that many of them spend too much time moaningand whining about being left behind. If I where them I'd bethinking-""All right I messed up and got left behind. What now?""I'd also be thanking GOD that I still have a chance to get rightwith Him! And I'd hurry up and get right with Him! And then startlooking for other new believers to fellowship with!On a positive note, the book is very graphic and gets its point across- you need to be right with GOD!"
5,It was the best!!!!!!!!!,It was the bestt!!!It only took me 2 days to read it all.It was pretty graphic& it really made you stop and think about your relationship with our LORD and SAVIOR.It was the best.
5,A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!!!,"I just want to start off by saying how this book is a must read for everyone. Whether you are saved or not, everyone MUST read this book. The contents of this book is basically the book of Revelation put in a story form. I've been saved for some time now, but it wasnt until I read this book, that I TRULY knew what it means to be saved and living the lifestyle. To everyone reading this who is not saved or who is saved and maybe has been out of fellowship with the Lord, I plead with you to get this book and get your lives right with God. ... Also for the people who are saved, please share this book with others that you know need it desperately..."
2,"The 1950 version of ""Left Behind""?","If you're a fan of the ""Left Behind"" series or Bible prophecy in general, this novel has some familiar elements, though it was published in 1950. Billed as ""based on Gospel truth,"" this story definitely reflects the 1950s in its simplistic, idealistic tone. The characters are rather Cleaver-like, but there is an underlying message of salvation.The author supports the notion of the pre-tribulation rapture, as do the authors of ""Left Behind,"" but the emphasis on the torture of newly converted believers in this work is particularly striking. The rapid spiritual change in some of the characters is not necessarily adequately explained, especially if this is meant as an evangelical piece. But in all honesty, I found most effective the very accurate-seeming and brutal depictions of the torture of believers at the hands of the antichrist and his minions. We all know from the Apostle Paul's life that this is not some fairy tale."
3,Raptured;,"When I received it, some of the pages fell out! The book is good, but I had a hard time reading it because of its condition."
3,Krista Allen fans need only apply,"As a Krista Allen fan, The Haunted Sea certainly belongs in my bookcase. She shoulders the lead, and without ruining the film for anyone, Ms Allen does as well as the script and director permit. The creature effects reminded me of my days at the matinees during the '50s. Historical accuracy goes out the window, so just kick back with your finger on the rewind button for the Krista Allen scenes.:)"
3,"Thin script haunts actors in""Haunted Sea""!","In typical Roger Corman style, the budget is low,the script paper thin.Yet, Krista Allen gives asincere effort with little to lend support. James Brolin, Joanna Pacula try too! Enjoyable if you don'ttake it seriously. Krista's Beauty makes it worth price of admission."
2,"So stupid, yet so funny","I saw this movie on Showtime one night, and I'll tell you, out of the many horror-accidentally-made-comedies I've seen, this one is one of the funniest. The monster looks like Godzilla and ET had a kid, the acting is cheesey, there's lots of slap stick (monster punching people or using its head to ram open a door), and there's just one unforgetable scene where the monster is hanging upside down, its mouth is wide open, and its eyes are almost bugged out of the skull and it's making this stupid sounding moan. A scene of which that made me laugh for at least half an hour."
1,Pretty goofy Godzilla rip off.,"Guy in a rubber monster suit chases people all over ship, killing them off one by one. Magic M16 rifle used by heroine never runs out of bullets (At the beginning of the flick,she didn't even know how to hold it! By the end, she's Annie Oakley!) Lame."
3,CHEESY HORROR FLICK,"GOOD STORY LINE YET BAD ACTING AND WRITING INTERFERES WITH THIS ROGER CORMAN HORROR FLICK. THE CREW OF A SHIP FINDS ANOTHER SHIP. THERE ARE NO PASSENGERS. THEY FIND AN OLD AZTEC TREASURE AND, FOR GOD KNOWS WHY, AN IDIOT GRABS IT. VERY COMMONLY IT WILL FLASH TO A MEMBER OF THE CREW TAKING OFF HER CLOTHES BUT, HEY, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM CHEESE? I ENJOYED LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS MUCH MORE."
2,Product stopped working after a few months,"This product was working fine for a while and it stopped working all of a sudden.. the power adapter started getting really hot while hooking up to the power outlet, but the laptop was not charging at all.."
2,"Funny, but not ""ha-ha"" funny","Funny -- of all of the plugs that come with this set, none of them fit the standard outlet in some parts of South America. They had the plug that they used for plugging in ovens and dryers down there, but not the one that you would use in your hotel room without buying an additional adapter.I can't speak to the usefulness of all of the other attachments, but the pouch took up more space than I would have preferred given that I was trying to pack a laptop and some carry-on items into the same bag.An easier and cheaper solution is to buy a cord in the country where you are traveling, or stop at a local hardware store to modify your current cord at a cost of $5 or less."
3,I must be in better shape than I thought,"I found this video to be a lot easier than I had expected and did not break much of a sweat. But I did enjoy the twists and poses she chose and will do this video again. I will just have to do some weights or another video after to feel that I've really done some work. All in all, Sara is a good teacher with a pleasent attitude but I did notice the left side not getting as much time as the right. (althought it was slight)"
1,Normally love Sara... not this time... BAD WORKOUT!,"I was sorely disappointed with this DVD. The poses are more like a warm-up for a more challenging routine that never comes. When I finished with this DVD, I had to do another one just to feel like I had done something. Not good at all. I normally really love Sara and still like her approach, tone, voice, kind attitude, etc. but the workout was not a workout at all. I will be selling my copy. It isn't worth what I paid for it AT ALL!"
2,Combat High,"I'm very disappointed and will be returning it. The video will not play in any DVD player, the picture jumps around. I had no idea the DVD was coming from another country and would not play correctly. If I would've known that ahead of time I never would have purchased it."
4,Nice overview of crystals and mineral spiritual correspondences...,"This is Volume IV in Dolfyn's series. It looks at certain crystals and their ""New Age"" / Magickal meanings and correspondences. Some entries also include short prayers/meditations by the author. I've found it a very helpful reference guide.For your information, the crystals/minerals covered in this book are:AmazoniteBlack ObsidianBlue Lace AgateCelestiteChalcedonyChrysocollaChrysopraseCoralFlintGarnetGypsumGoldHawk's EyeHematiteJasperJetLabradoriteMalachiteMeteoritesMoss AgateOpalPeridotPetrified WoodPyriteSardSardonyxSeleniteSilverSodalite"
3,Bombastic Bach,"I could barely force myself to listen to the whole set because Barenboim's touch is harsh and overbearing, he pedals too much and much passage work is muddy, and his approach is willful and anachronistic. I don't mind pianistic, even quasi-Romantic Bach (admiration for Edwin Fischer and Sviatoslav Richter comes to mind) but this is as if he were playing on the piano analog of a Tyrannosaurus rex. Scary. And it takes three CDs, for goodness sake! Unless you're a huge fan of Barenboim in his piano-playing incarnation, avoid this one."
2,Just not very exciting.,"Barenboim's playing is probably not as horrible as the first reviewer suggests. However, Mr. Barenboim's interpretation just sounds directionless and lacking drama to my ears. Listening to these discs feels like one disappointment after another. I must agree that these disc should be avoided."
5,"Great, exciting motorcycle adventures.","The trip to Alaska on her motorcycle with her dog Commache is something to admire, very inticing and something a lot of people wish they could do. Very, very interesting book, a must for all motorcycle riders and anybody that is a lover of the great outdoors."
2,OK,"It was ok. i was expecting more from Vargas Llosa!It was sort of boring actually. The flow was kind of ""here and there and everywhere""... I think that the presentation of the facts fell short and missed a lot of points. :-("
2,"What happened to the ""Lost And Found"" CD!","If you're a Beach Boys fan who wants the most complete collection possible of their pre-Capitol records (1961-1962), then get the ""Lost And Found"" CD instead, which includes all of the Beach Boys songs here plus many bonus tracks, including studio chatter, alternate takes, demos, and so on. The songs by other bands on this CD are expendable.Unfortunately, since this CD came out, The ""Lost And Found"" CD has seemed to disappear. If you can find it somewhere, you know what to do. If that CD never comes back, it is really a shame because it is the definitive collection of those recordings."
5,A Panoramic View of Christ's Words from the NT,"Really get to know Jesus by reading His own words. All of the New Testament quotes of Our Lord are gathered here. It makes a wonderful personal devotion book, an intriguing group Bible study, and will be very useful in school and home-school situations. I felt like I was reading a letter from my Lord. Every time I dig into this volume I come away challenged and blessed."
4,This EP shows the promising beginnings of Deathline Int'l.,"""Open Your Eyes"" remains one of my all-time favorites by Deathline Int'l. This album's humorous note comes on the last track with their cover of, strangely enough, the country song ""Rawhide"". Another song (""Generation Fantome"") features Evan Sornstein of Battery playing the saxophone -- quite well, I must add -- which gives that track a jazzy feel. The title track and ""War Chant Ma$chine"" are also worthy examples of the C.O.P. Int'l Records idiom."
5,Must Read,"All three of these stories got my attention and had me turning the pages for more. Definitely kept my interest and contains hot, lusty story scenarios that can only happen in books! I highly recommend this book and guarantee you won't want to put it down!!!"
2,Good service,"The seller was great in this transaction, but the book itself lacked in the content.If you really want to find out some of the ""meat and potatoes"" about freemasonry, get your hands on a copy of ""The Morals and Dogma of the Scottish Rite""; it will let you know about a lot of the garbage that goes on within the PHILOSPHY of the cult."
5,"Blissful, stress-free meditation","I had a difficult time allowing myself time to play this CD. I have only played Side One , 66 minutes long. It is the best thing that I have done for inner peace and physical alertness in a long time. I use it twice a week, once by lying on the couch on a weekend--turning off the telephone and the answering machine. The other time I play it just after I awaken in the morning, again on the weekend. I am astonished what I think about, what my subconscious brings forth, and how much better I feel."
4,Audio healing,"A soothing and peaceful time away from the stressful situations that can cause illness. Dr. Weil's voice is very comforting and the music he has chosen lulls you into a delightful musical journey into rest and tranquility, which is most beneficial in promoting healing of all kinds, physical and emotional."
4,RS Austin,"Very beautiful and relaxing which is why I needed it--stress relief. So yes, it is healing."
4,What color ARE Denise's eyes?,"Winston gets a part-timer working in the Dean's office, still dating Denise, who is described in this book as having blue eyes. She had ""almost-black"" eyes in SVU #1, another booboo Pascal! Anyway, the Dean's sexy-but-promiscuous wife, Amanda, flirts with Winston and then visits him one night in his dorm room...he partially declines her, but she witnesses a killer attacking someone outside his window! Winston tries to bring the attack to light himself, but is discredited in court...and so brings the truth about their ""affair"" into the open. But the killer has a pattern of blonde victims (due to adolescent rejection), and is it already too late to save someone close to them? Denise & Winston team up to go undercover again in order to solve this one...very suspenseful!"
5,beautiful....delicate,"When I first saw the ring I was like :i like this: but was expecting something bigger.....but when the ring came it was more beautiful then I could ever image....100% satisfied. My friends are like you must of pay alot for that ...a secret i keep to myself (smile)Sterling Silver Mother of Pearl Inlay Celtic Knot Ring (Size 5,6,7,8,9,10)"
4,Wooden Teeth and Jelly Beans-- the greatest president book,"Okay, so I'm kind of young but hey! I can still review a great book. Wooden teeth and Jelly beans is a book about presidents- but not the ordinary kind. It gives great facts in a fun and colorful way. I enjoyed reading it and kept on reading it over and over. I reccommend this book for anyone that can read or is in the ages of 7 to 777 years old. I especially loved the pictures that are like really good charicatures of all the presidents from Washington to Clinton. I really hope you pick up this book because this book is the best example I have seen of an educational book that can be fun!"
2,Easy to forget,"I read this book in one day. I waited another day then read Elmore Leonard's ""LaBrava"". An hour after I finished the second book I hardly remembered anything about either one of them- they are both just so easy to forget. I'm afraid the reviewers who claim Leonard is so great at characterization have never read a really good book or have spent too much time in front of a TV. It is not that the writing is bad, it just doesn't have any depth. The best thing I can say about Glitz is that the bad guy is really creepy, and that's a compliment. But that's not reason enough to spend money and time on this kind of fluff."
2,Way Too Much Hype about this guy,"When I bought this book, I believed I was going to read the cream of the crop of crime novels. It isn't. The main character lacks charisma big time. The villains lack charisma big time. Hell, not even the girl has much. The only really cool character is the ex-football player. And he's a secondary one.Why do I even give two stars? Because, I must admit, I'm very afraid to give this guy less than that. He certainly did his homework and knows a lot of the cop slang and settings he describes. But that's a very common flaw, to put a lot of accurate information on a BORING plot.For great crime fiction, do check on James Elroy."
4,Home From Home,"As with the great majority of Leonard's books, certain qualities can be taken as a given. The dialogue is vibrant and snappy, and the characters and plotline feed off each other - as is true with all great thriller writers - proving that the only things needed to power a story are the failings, weaknesses, vanities, and reluctant ethics of the characters themselves.The central issue here is the dance between Vincent Mora (a Miami based police officer, convalescing after being shot on duty) and Teddy Magyk (a devious degenerate who Mora helped put away). With Puerto Rico as the expertly sketched backdrop, and all the secondary characters drawn with economic verve, if this novel falls just shy of the writer's best work it's because of those standards he's set for himself, and shouldn't be any barrier to enjoying this vivid work."
4,Good,"This was my first Elmore Leonard novel. I have seen the movies based on his novels which made me curious about his writing. I will read more of his novels. I thought this one was a good suspense novel and appreciated that the characters were flawed, even the heroes."
2,"Great writing chops don't make up for lame plot, characters","I was dazzled by Leonard's writing here, but as the story progressed I didn't feel any simpathy for the sleazy characters or feel very intrested in the plot."
1,CamRon Comes Again With Another Horrible Album.,"Once again I don't know why I do it to myself...why do I even try to listen to a CamRon album? CamRon is one of the worst rappers I've ever heard. He is so wack. He has never showed me that he has any potential and its hard to understand how anyone likes him. His lyrics are garbage because you can never understand what he's talking about. His doody doody, luey, gooey rhyme style is just that... doody doody. His production is even lame on the album when usually Dipset releases have good beats at least. I'm so glad I burnt this cd and only because someone asked for it. Save yourself an hour and some change or in my case about 13 minutes to skim through the cd and then throw it away. 0 stars"
2,What happened here?,"This album has lost replay value to me very quickly......The main problem with this album is that the tracks have strictly FILLER on here....After the decent intro, tracks 2-6 are just str8 filler, average to not-2-hot production on this....uninspired lyrics that dont become that memmorable here.....What happened Cam? When 'Wet Wipes' and 'Touch It Or NOt' and 'War' come on after tracks 2-6 those heat up the album and pick up the pace....After those tracks the rest of the album just has average production again, and arent that good on a lyric scale.....I know Cam'ron while making the Purple Haze album wanted to use rap for entertainment and all of that, but this album poorly follows up on Purple Haze with the entertainment factor that he's known for....To be honest, I thought Touch It Or Not and Wet Wipes had some hilarious lyrics to them, but it was only 2 tracks that had that factor....Come Home With Me S.D.E. and Confessions Of Fire are miles above this album....."
3,Knife to a Gunfight,"i rushed out to get Killa Season yesterday. i even posted a bulletin on myspace tell my people to get it. so far, after one day, i am little disappointed. i supported Cam during the Jay-Z attack, but i think Jay played it smart by letting Killa Season come out first. this doesnt compare to ANY of Jay-Z's previous albums. Killa's flow is str-8, but most of the beats are subpar. The DIPSET is usually hit or miss when it comes to tight tracks, but as the leader, cam couldnt have picked a worse time to start drama.Although not as bad, Killa Season will have the same effect on the DIPSET's chance at a dynasty as Keith Murray's 2nd album did to the Def Squad. Ya'll were SOOOO close!"
5,BEST CD OUT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!,Cam'ron really did his thing on this album even if you dont like killa and dipset when you hear this cd you will like him its hot all the way through from the first song to the last song.
3,Worth it 4 2 songs,"Cam didnt do real good wit dis. This review should be 2.5 but 3 4 the 2 five star tracks on this album.Wet Wipes:Great beat, great chorus, this is tha 2nd greatest song on da album.You Gotta Love It:Awesome chorus and the beat has to be in my top 5 beats(my number 1 is Cassidy's 6 Minutes nuthin could beat dat beat and ery1's flow in dat song) Jay-Z has nuthin on Cam'Ron cuz he goes at him with a kaboom in this song.Conclusion:Not Cam's classic work like Confessions of Fire but 4 dese 2 songs the album is worth the price unless u have itunes or sumthin"
4,Killa Season,"When I first listened to Killa Season, I was only impressed by a few songs such as Wet Wipes, Touch it or Not, and White Girls. Then after a few days I started to listen to the cd more and more and I started to really feel it and was able to listen to it the whole way through. This is one of those albums you really have to grow on and understand the swagger of Harlem. Theres are many gems on this album such as the Intro, Living a Lie, We Make Change, War, and Triple Up. This is definately up there with the best albums of 2006 thus far, although we are still waiting on several albums yet to drop such as Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, JR Writer, The Game and Fat Joe.I definately recommend this to anyone who lives around or in New York City as it has a real east coast swag to it. However, S.D.E. still reigns supreme as Cam'ron's all time best album"
1,Killa nothin!!!,"I miss the Cam'ron that meet Puff & knows Mason!!! This album is trash!!! Hot Garbage, from beginning to end! I wish I could give it a negative star! I love Cam but all these bad albums are getting out of hand! Go back to your Confessions of fire flow!!"
1,Horrible,U can tell that this album is low budget. Now that he is getting marketed buy Asylum not DefJam the beat selection is cut down. He doesnt even have money to bring the heatmakers back (only 1 track) the rest are no names. Beats-lame Lyrics-lame. He really thinks he can compete with jay-z?
1,Are u SERIOUS?,"Cam'ron is finished. Ever since Purple Haze which was crap, he hasen't done anything significant. Juelz Santana is more popular than him right now and that's a bad sign because Juelz isn't even all that. I haven't heard this album but Killa Kam's rep is enough to let me know that this is BS AKA PHONY like his so called Killa rep. His rhymes are slow and very stupid. He rhymes some of the dumbest things I' ve heard. Only artists from the south the likes of Mike Jones and lil' Jon who should be considered rappers (they are more like a disease) are worse. Cam needs to quit now."
1,Killa' PLEASE!,"Corny Cam Corny Cam Corny Cam. Never Liked him. Never will. Come on Son! Hov' is so hot right now (and the brotha' retired). Carter Administration can EASILY deflate the deflatable Damon Dash Entertainment. Corny SON! No stars, SON!"
2,"Thank Cam, Dame Dash, and Dipset for ending Cam's solo career.","Mark 2006 as the year that Cam committed career suicide. He should have went at 50, Mase and G-Unit, since they are the crew that's on top right now and everyone loves to hate on. Instead, he chose Jay, who's been retired for 3 years and is a living legend. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Before all the attacks on Jay, he was on pace to be next in line to the throne. Now, he's on pace to not being mentioned at all. I will give Cam and Jim Jones credit for being hilarious, but it looks like Jay-Z will get the last laugh."
2,"Good artistry, but not my favorite memory capturing book","I was given a ""Pocketfull of Christmas Memories"" book by my in-laws on my husband and my first Christmas together. I loved the book, and last year was the last entry into the book as there were no more pages. My previous book covered Holiday events attended, holiday preperations, family traditions new and old, gifts received and given, as well as entries for what was done on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Years Eve. I was a little disappointed when I got this book in that it only allows for a small amount of journaling on what was done on Christmas Day. The pages and book itself are absolutely beautiful, but it does not allow the owner to capture memories of the ENTIRE holiday season."
3,"Beautiful Book, but....","This is a beautiful book and well constructed. I was hoping to have some blank space with each year so that I could add fun pictures taken at Christmas time. I did this the past 20 years with a a different Christmas Diary and the children and grand children love it. It really adds a great demension to the written documentation about Christmas through the years. I am keeping the book and will use some of the pages for the next year to add my photos. I'll lose some years of recording in this book as a result, but that's okay. I'll have the holiday documented the way I want it; pictures and written word."
1,Germany's answer to Ministry,Testify has been compared to Ministry but the Essen Germany band has taken it to the next level! If you enjoy the computerized metal of Ministry and White Zombie...Testify should be #1 on your shopping list!
5,Not just for children,"About an hour into this opera, I asked myself, ""Where in the operas of the past three quarters of a century (since Puccini) has there been music of such overwhelming beauty?"" Well, there are some passages in ""Rosenkavalier"" and ""Peter Grimes""--but where else? This is not to knock modern opera, for many such works succeed as great dramas, but for sheer melodic invention ""The Little Prince"" belongs with the best of them. Don't buy it for your kids--buy it for yourself. In fact, my one reservation is that the story could be a bit too complicated for most children. I'll ask my grandchildren when they get a bit older. But between now and then I'm sure I will watch it many times. (If anyone reading this has watched it with children, please post their impressions here)."
5,little prince rules!,A fantastic story portrayed by a fine young man and a wonderful cast. The music was brilliant
5,Joseph a bit younger,Joseph at a younger age with that messed up hair in his first major production of The Littel Prince. If you are a fan of his this is a must to have for your collection. What a high voice he had and such a good voice at such a young age. Buy it while you can.
4,Fun to watch once; Wonderful baritone,"This isn't an opera that you'd watch once a month, but it's entertaining enough to watch once. The cast has wonderful singers who are certainly well-known to opera lovers. The lead role of the pilot is sung by Teddy Tadu Rhodes, who is perfectly cast for both his sweet baritone and his good looks."
1,The Little Prince (opera),"I hated this version of the Little Prince! There is nothing I like about it - the songs, the set - absolutely nothing! I used it for class after reading the book, testing it, etc., and the eighth graders critiqued it.Don't buy this DVD version."
1,Misled,"I was looking for shock extensions for a specific shock, Bilstein! Although they said they would fit they were the wrong thread!"
5,An excellent supplement to all those dry jazz piano books,"The Andy Lavern tapes are GREAT! I never thought modal scales could be made interesting, but Andy had me jumping off my seat to try out his runs on my piano. When presented in books, the scales are so dry, but Andy's thematic presentation was very enjoyable. I never knew where to find that jazzy sound on the keyboard before, the tension and dissonance that I hear on records. Andy is accompanied by some fine musicians. Playing through the tunes with the jazz trio and quartet was very helpful, since I had a hint as to what the bass player was doing. Tape 1 covers the modes of the major scale, practical shell voicings and song arrangements. Tape 2 does the same for the melodic minor."
3,A Marilyn Reference Guide,"This book should have been written in a large tome, not as a pocket book, as it contains lots of information about Marilyn Monroe, with lots rare pictures and new information. It's good for quick reference to those who are interested in Monroe and want quick access to something in particular concerning her life, films and trivia."
3,Sequel to the Stek Trek novel Dreadnought.,"This novel continues the adventures of a new character in the Star Trek universe: Lt. Commander Piper.The novel itself deals with a topic that was hot at the time:Transwarp. If you can get past the techno-babble, it is fairly good reading.Not a traditional Original Series novel.Note the errors on pages:176, 194, 201, and 219. This novel was obviuosly rushed into production to catch the coattails of the best selling Dreadnought! novel."
3,A Little Too Much,"I did like this book, in that it was well written. However, I gave it 3 starts for one simple fact: the main character. The character of ""Piper"", is to me, even less likable in this novel than in the previous novel, Dreadnaught. She is WAY to obsessed with Kirk and his opinions/ideas. Piper, as a young Lieutenant Commander, has no real ideas of her own (and when she does get them, its a big mental struggle to formulate one.) She has to pass all of her mental theories with her personal image of ""What Would Kirk Do in this situation?"" and it gets old. In all honesty, she doesn't really know Kirk at all. In the timeline of these two novels she has only known Kirk personally for a few weeks. This is not the kind of officer I'd like to serve under, if I were in Star Fleet. Nor is this the kind of officer that Star Fleet should be placing in command of a star ship."
4,excellent follow up,"Amina's follow up to ""Ya lil"" might at first hearing cause some to despair but this follow up is even better than its predecessor.Amina mixes together her influences & alternates between languages together to create this earthy/ethereal atmosphere.This album clearly has to be heard in a different mood than ""Ya lil"" as amina changed her musical perspective albeit retaining her own essence,in other words maturing in the right direction.songs like Zahra,Atame, ma musqiue est cassee & A l'abri des portes qui claquent are intriguingly absorbing.The whole album is simply ingenious."
4,Great,"Perhaps not as accomplished as Amina's previous effort, Wa Di Ye is marred by two major factors: the use of children in backing vocals, and the exclusion of her 1991 Eurovision entry. Otherwise, sit back and let this Cd transport you throughout its many musical flavours."
2,battery life sucks,"Easy to install and go. However, within a year, the battery life is less than 30 minutes. Connectivity within the device is poor - causing the device to quit working, and have to go to charging station to reset and start working again.Therefore, it works for a while, but the connection is poor so it's not really a great buy."
1,A high price for one month of service,"Bought this battery for my panasonic phone. When it first arrived, it worked fine and seemed like a great buy. One month later, the battery had died. Spend the money on the manufacturers battery, you'll save in the long run."
5,Authentic; No Ghost Writers Involved,"San Diego,I edited the book. I was there when Kane & Abel wrote both stories. Trust, there were NO GHOST WRITERS involved. Stop hatin'.Griffin Paperback Rep"
5,Unbievable-The two stories were remarkable.,"If you like to read great novels you must read these two stories by Kane and Abel. Surprisingly, these two stories kept my attention from the begin to the end. I would like to see Eyes of a Killer on the big screen. Keep writing and keep spiting them tight lyrics. Good luck on that case. I know you guys did not do that. But you know they think that every black rapper is a drug dealer or a killer. But I know they can not stop you guys they can only try to slow you guys down. Do not stop dropping them hits(Gangstafied, and Time After Time). Kane and Abel keep your trust in God. In hurry up in finished The speed of darkness. I am like the others I can not wait to read it. Peace"
5,A must read book for all readers.,"I like to comment these two guys on their first well written novel. You guys are already great rappers but now writers that's cool. The first story ""Eyes of a Killer"" was so good that I read it a second time before reading the next story. However the second story ""Behind Enemies Line"" was as good as ""Eyes of Killers"", and I also read this story twice. I think that ""Eyes of a Killer"" would be a great movie. Take this story to the Big Screen if you can. It will sell. Both stories were unique, full of energy, and excited. I was so starle by you guys street knowledge I bought my best friend this book for her birthday. She loves reading Donald Goines books and I know she will enjoy reading these two well plotted, heart stopping, and eye opener stories. I can not wait to read you guys next book ""The Speed of Darkness."" Please hurry up in finished it. You guys are talented rappers and writers-Keep the great work up! Tru Soldiers"
5,As good as it gets!,An instant classic!!! Some of the finest tones recorded to some of the tastiest playing on the planet along with great songs. Can't wait till the next one.
3,Good... but...,"I bought a pair of these boots. I must admit they are quite comfortable, I use for my work in construction.However, soon after purchased part of the sole started to peel off, I bought in the U.S. while I was traveling and then returned to Costa Rica, which had no option to return. So I decided to fix them with glue ... but again some parts of the sole started to come off, so I decided to send them back for repair.Indeed boots are very comfortable, but I had the misfortune to receive a glue problems."
5,Works as advertised.,Works as advertised in my 1999 Ford Ranger XLT 4.0. The old sensor went bad and posted a check engine light. I installed this one and the light went out and stayed out.
4,great glove,I bought this glove for my nephew. It's a great glove and my Nephew loves it. Has a pretty good grip.
2,Never got the plant- out of season,"I ordered this as a gift for mother's day. I had ordered this item about two weeks prior, thinking this would have plenty of time to get there. Unfortunately, this plant never arrived. I was told it would be sent out soon. Finally after almost two months without a plant I finally got in touch with someone at spring hill that knew what was going out. I found out that the plant would not get there because it was out of it's growing season and I would have to wait until next season or I could be refunded my money, but it took a while to get refunded on my statement. I would recommended to anyone ordering that you find out the availability is first, as well as order it WAY before you think it will arrive. If you are late in the season, or are ordering this with a time line, then choose another gift. Amazon was very helpful with me resolving my problem with this vendor. Spring Hill was slow in communication and providing conflict resolution."
4,Love the old time blue feeling here ...,So glad I had the chance to catch this one. It's nice to have a new record to chill to. Having Stevie Nicks on it so makes it for me. If your a fan of anyone of these ladies I would recommend a listen.
3,This book gives much insight to women of the Heian period.,"The ""Diary of Lady Murasaki,"" displays the customs and lifestyles of women during the Heian period (794-1192 A.D.). She was born into the Fujiwara family, and entered in to court services. Murasaki's diary gives an exuberant description of court life and gives the reader a look into her personal thoughts."
4,A great look at Japanese history,"The Diary of Lady Murasaki is a very fine read, even by today's standards. Sadly short due to age, it still offers an amazing insight into court life of the time.The book's coverage of both important court events and the personal outlook of Murasaki herself on everything from fashion to her contemporaries is eye-opening to say the least. Great attention is paid to detail where she was able to remember any detail at all, and when she does not remember detail, she always made a note of why. Perhaps the most refreshing part of the book is the honesty in her observations. She seldom seems to mince words, which is not something that I would expect from anyone at all familiar with court politics.The book is especially valuable given the lack of other documents to come out of the period."
5,A must read for Asian history buffs.,"And a companion piece ot the Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon. The world of courtiers and courtesans, intrigues, affairs.Daily soaps will never be exciting once you've read this book! WOW!"
1,Crumbled out of package,"At first I didn't know what a pouch of black powder was for until I put the mick on and found it bare. It was an extra fiber cap. So far, the sound isn't near as clear as my flip video. I don't like making purchases where I have to make a second to fix it."
1,This product does not work,"I had this thing working and then the bottom fell out. I believe in my heart Jesus Christ is the son of God and I confess him as my Lord and Savior. Lord Jesus, I need you to do a miracle. Thank you, I am getting a replacement."
5,A witty and inteligent insight into the world of surfing,"I really enjoyed this book, it left me wanting much more. A well researched and descriptive look at the bizare world of big wave surfers. Particularly suited to those who have not and have no intention of surfing big waves themselves, but would like to get inside the head of the people who do. It has a travelogue style, I think it would appeal to readers of Eric Newby or even books like ""A year in Provence"". His other book ""Coming down the Mountain"", takes a similar approach, but to World cup Down Hill skiing. Again a good read, but for me not quite so riveting as this one. Give it a try"
3,Disjointed and rather scanty memoir,"This memoir is disappointing in two ways: first, it doesn't tell the reader much about what a courier did, and second, it doesn't give much information about how the author felt about events. It has the disjointed quality of many Civil War memoirs. Gill, who started out in the First Maryland Infantry, then transferred to the cavalry and became a courier, gives a decent description of First Manassas and of various cavalry fights. He was involved in the Valley Campaigns of '62 and '64, among other important actions. Aside from some vivid moments, though, his account doesn't give the reader much idea of what his experiences were like. I wouldn't really recommend seeking this one out."
5,A Truely Evil Masterpiece...,"Being one of my favorite cds of all time,I found myself obligated to write a brief review. Darkthone have the ability to conjure pure audible evil.The lyrics are compelling,sinister & full of emotion. Drummer & Vocalist Fenriz can tear your soul through your chest w/ his seething delivery(...or devilry..)Don't miss this True Norwegian Black Metal classic!!"
1,Light Duty,"These are ok but are very thin plastic and are very small. I noticed in hind sight that these were only 12 oz. but they looked like the normal restaurant size in the pic so I did not pay attention. If you are looking for something long lasting these are not the item. If you are looking for throw away, these are ok."
3,"Fun toy, but shade does not work well","When my 10-month-old used this toy in our friends' pool, we found that it was great for her to kick and get used to the water. Two down sides: The shade blow-up attachment didn't seem to work very well. Also, when she would lean forward, she would get a face full of water that had splashed into the front part of the float. This is a good toy if the shade isn't the reason that you are buying it!"
4,"Easy, and flavorful, Indian Cooking","The book provides all the information needed for a novice to cook and enjoy authentic Indian cooking. Common substitutions for ethnic ingredients are very helpful. The photography is more than adequate, and evocative. I have enjoyed learning more about foods that I enjoy, and a culture different from mine. I recommend this cookbook to anyone who enjoys Indian food and cooking."
2,Nice Layout but food does not come out good,"I bought this book thinking that I could recreate all of the wonderful dishes that I regularly enjoy at the many Indian restaurants in Houston. Figuring that the author lives in Houston, the dishes would resemble the stuff I get in the Mahatma Gandhi District. After spending about thirty bucks on spices and ingredients at a local Indian grocer, I was stoked on making some good food. I have tried two recipes in this book and both were disappointing. Pork vindaloo was dry and malty, the methi aloo tasted Americanized. Sorry to say, I will not try any more recipes from this book."
3,Could have used a good editor,"I have to agree that the book is a real pain to read because the writing is so lousy. I'm glad to finally have such a detailed account not only of the story of Joy Division but the whole Manchester scene in general. The information is good, but I just can't deal with the sub-standard writing.An unfortunate strike against an otherwise interesting book."
2,"Makes great bread, but not a durable product.","This breadmaker makes fabulous bread, but in my experience one breadmaker only lasts about 6 months. This is the breadmaker for the occasional bread baker- once a month or so; if, however, you are like me and wish to have homemade bread on a regular basis, this product will not stand up. During the 3-year warranty period I went through about 7 breadmakers. This is another drawback: the 3-year warranty is only good from the original date of purchase, so if you need a replacement breadmaker, the replacement doesn't come with a new guarantee. Not only that, but Cuisinart's policy is that the customer pays the shipping costs for having a new breadmaker shipped and the old one shipped back to the company. I do not recommend this product."
2,blond bread,"I am finding the learning curve for this appliance very steep. I followed the included recipe for plain white bread and ended up with a barely baked loaf of bread with a very very light crust. I checked the recipe and found I had made no errors but the trouble shooting section said to reduce the amount of water. I cut a quarter cup of water from the recipe and had much the same results. The following loaf I set the controls to a whole wheat setting and the largest loaf, which gave a longer rise and baking time. The top of the loaf still needed further time in my oven to brown but, the inside of the loaf was no longer a gooey mess. After two more attempts I still have not made a loaf of bread that compares with the bread that I can make using my Kitchen Aid to knead the dough and allowing my bread to rise the old fashion way. The more I use it the more dissatisfied I am with this purchase."
1,Paddle comes loose all the time=poor bread,After wearing out a Breadman machine (I make bread fresh every other day) I got this machine and have been very disappointed by the quality control of the bread pan and paddle. We are now on our 2nd paddle and bread pan because the fit between these two items is very poor. More often than not the paddle comes loose during the kneading cycle resulting in very poor bread. Cuisinart are sending us yet another pan and if this does not fix the problem then we are going to return the entire item and look for a model with better QA.
1,Cuisinart CBK-200: Flawed Design,"If you're looking for a bread machine, keep looking. While this model offers some nice features, the design of the pan is awful. During the kneading cycle, the pan comes loose. When it does, the machine keeps motoring away, thinking it's kneading the bread, while the whole thing makes a racket.Don't even think about walking away from it during the kneading cycle. Plan on standing over it, or better still, holding the pan in for the half hour or so that kneading takes.Once the kneading ordeal is over, the machine can make a nice loaf of bread. The interior will have good consistency, and the crust a satisfying crunch. Just don't think of this machine as one that can operate unattended."
5,diagnosed with a Gluten allergy,"Short and to the point. For the money this is the best bread maker around. easy to use, with great bread in the end. I have two boys diagnosed with a Gluten allergy. So I have to make all my own bread. this bread maker has been putting out two loafs of bread a day for over three months. I had two other bread makers before this one. And to say the least I burned them out in one month."
1,Stumbled right out of the gate...,After reading tons of reviews and doing a lot of research I bought this for my wife for Christmas. I pikced this one because she bakes 1-2 loaves a week and is a serious bread maker. Five minutes into the first use (using one of the simple recipes provided to test) it made a loud screech and broke. The paddle wouldn't turn. After playing with it we got it going enough to finish the bread (which was good by the way). But it was clearly broken - I suspect the drive belt came off. Maybe we just got unlucky but my wife had been waiting for a new machine and we are very frustrated.
3,"Broke Quickly, But Replaced for Free (sort of)","I REALLY like this bread machine. It is easy to use and works well - when it works. Like other reviewers, my machine died after about 8 cycles (the pan and paddle became stuck). Cuisinart's customer service was very helpful and sent me a new machine free because it was under warranty. They asked that they return the defective machine at my cost for shipping. I figured I got about $15 of use out of the old machine, so I returned it - I also felt it was the honest thing to do. My new machine is working so far. I hope Cuisinart fixed the glitch and its not in their replacement machines."
1,Broke after one loaf,"I just received this as a gift a few days ago. I made one loaf of bread. Took a long time to cook but came out pretty good. Today I tried to make another loaf. I made a mistake in measuring the flour, so I unplugged it to start with a new batch. Even after 15 minutes, the memory wouldn't clear so I could start over. After about 30 minutes I plugged it in again, and nothing happened.I called Cuisinart and they made me try a couple of things, but still nothing. They have great customer service and they said they would send me another.I hope that one lasts more than one loaf. I'll write another review and let you know."
2,Cuisinart cbk-200 Bread maker,"I don't know if there is something wrong with the breadmaker or I am doing something wrong, but I've made 6 loaves and burned them all. The top looks fine but the sides are burned. This is not my first breadmaker I've 4 other ones but none were convection. I am almost ready to return it."
4,Cusinart Bread Machine,I have only 1 complaint about the Bread Machine. That is the handle on the Bread pan. It tears up the Bread getting it out of the pan.Otherwise it is a very good product. So I gave it a 4 star.
2,Doesn't live up to hype,"I bought this item because the manufacturer claims it does 1 lb. loaves. Which it does, except they are about 3 inches high and totally useless. It's louder than my old breadmaker (Oster- it lasted for years), the pan wobbles inside. To make matters worse it just stopped working after 9 months. Sure I can send it to the manufacturer for a replacement, but I've found that in bread machines the one they send is is as lousy as the original (we have had several). For a little more than what it costs to send it back, I'll be buying another Oster!"
3,It has both good and bad,"I started making my own bread in a cheap machine purchased at a local discount store. It did just fine, but after deciding to make ALL the bread consumed in my house, it was time to upgrade. I really liked the paddle-removal-beep feature on this machine. That, in itself, is reason to buy it. However, the paddle can be VERY VERY difficult to remove. It usually takes a good hard pull and half a dozen curse words to get it out. I've also had difficulty with this machine burning my bread. The recipes that come in the manual work great, but recipes from my bread machine cookbooks always burn. Of course, you can take the worked dough out and put it in the oven, but that sort of defeats the whole paddle-removal-beep feature. If you're willing to work with it to figure out how to use your own recipes and you really hate the paddle hole in your current bread machine, it's a good one."
4,"Great Items, as long as you follow a couple tips..","I was planning on saving for the expensive Japanese brand after reading breach maching reviews on amazon, but then my Husband bought me the Cuisnart as a graduation gift. The machine does have a tendency to burn the bread as other reviewers have mentioned, but I find as long as I put the setting on light and check the bread towards the end of the cycle its fine...I have just had to stop the machine a bit early a couple times so that the bread didn't burn.The other thing is that it is important to make sure that the removeable bread holder/mixer is clipped into tightly and securely before making bread, its easy to mixtake it for being in securely and if it's not secure, the machine will not knead the bread properly.Other than the fact the machine is not ""fool proof"", I have had excellent results as long as I am careful with those two things and the recipe book is great!"
3,Cuisinart Breadmaker,"The Cuisinart CBK-200 stainless steel 2 lb Breadmaker is a beautiful machine. I purchased it because it has a Gluten Free cycle, and I have celiac disease. However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed that the recipes for Gluten Free breads in the recipe section only had 5 recipes and NONE of them were for sandwich type bread - all were with nuts or seeds, or cheese, or sweet stuff, etc. I made one, and it was so soft & sticky I couldn't take the paddle out at the time indicated. Then it was a short, hard loaf.Because all the recipes call for MILK, and the other ones I have use water I may try my (Betty Hagaman) other recipes & add dry milk.I just want REGULAR SANDWICH bread !!"
1,Does not work,"Don't buy this breadmaker. I followed the instructions to the letter, even bought all new ingredients, and it still does not work. I end up with a gooey loaf, that is hard as a brick. My dogs wouldn't even eat it. I tried unsucessesfully 3 times to make the white bread recipe, each time ending up with the same brick. I decided to try one last time and decided to take the dough out on the 2 rise and bake it in the oven. That bread turned out perfectly. I wrote two letters to cruisinart about my bread maker and still have not heard back from them. I definately will not buy anything from cuisinart again."
1,This machine is terrible!,"Brief tale: bought the machine, made three loaves of bread with different ingredients, all did not rise, returned the machine. Bought the Panasonic, every loaf (30+ at this point) I've tried has turned out great.Don't buy this POS. You will be sorry, unless you like hard, dense bricks for bread."
2,"Great, when it works. One major mechanical flaw","My biggest problem with this breadmaker is a mechanical one. It continuously jumps off the gear at the bottom of the breadmaker and the bin (with the dough in it)jumps around, gets stuck, creates and immense racket! Drive me crazy and I have to continuously reset it, pause, restart, over and over to the point where I'm wonder if it's not just as time consumer as to make it myself.The other thing, with the manual, and other breadmaker books - there is never a simple recipe for white bread. there's always some extensive list of ingredients that most people don't have and for weekly (most common) use, having recipes for dill sundried tomatoe whole wheat rice flour old timer jam bread is just pretty much a waste too.When the machine works, and I know have a basic recipe to follow, it's great. But I wouldn't buy another Cuisinart for the glaring mechanical issue."
2,Multiple problems,"I have been using bread machines for 15-20 years and was excited about using the Cuisinart machine since my experience with Cuisinart products had been good. After a few months the container could not be removed because the tabs were stuck. I called and was told to simply adjust them, which I did. This had to be done everytime I baked bread.Finally, the machine just died. I loaded it, turned it on and it kneaded for about 2 minutes, then stopped, kneaded for 30 seconds, then stopped. I finally took the dough out of the pan, hand kneaded it and baked it in the oven.I have since bought another machine since I bake all of our bread.I am looking for a way to dispose of it in an environmentally sound way."
3,"O.k., has some problems","I bought the cuisinart breadmaker about a month ago from Amazon. I have used the machine about 4 or 5 times now. It does have a very strong motor and has had no problems mixing dough. It is pretty simple to use and the accompanying guide lets you know exactly how long and when each cycle will be done. But, as other reviewers have pointed out, once you push start you can't go back. So, if you realize that you hit ""rapid sweet bread"" rather than ""sweet bread"", you cannot easily fix the situation. So be very careful when programming the machine. Also, my machine tends to overbake the bread. The breads I baked on medium crust are almost burnt. I will from now on only use the light crust setting (even if the recipe I am using says to use the medium crust setting). I have also found that some of the small loaves and 1.5 lb loaves fill the pan completely. So, I would not use a 2 lb bread recipe until you have tried the smaller sizes first!"
2,Burns the bread,"I own everything Cuisinart in my kitchen, and was excited to buy and own the bread machine. I've made 3 loaves so far, following the instructions to the letter. I even bought an instant-read thermometer so I could make sure all ingredients were at the proper temperature. Even on the light setting, the machine has burned all three loaves. The first loaf I made, a banana quick bread, was already burned with 29 minutes left in the bake cycle. I had to pull it out early. The second loaf, a Sally Lunn bread, was already burned with 18 minutes left in the bake cycle. I've decided that I can never leave during breadmaking, and will have to babysit every loaf, taking them out when I feel they are done. What a disappointment."
3,defective bread pan non-stick surface,"Got my bread machine today - defective the non-stick bread pan surface. Looks like Cuisinart company started to make their products in China too, so quality is not good. I did not have chance to use the machine - do not want to eat the peaces of surface (if they come off)."
1,Unreliable Product does not last,"First, the good news. I got this as a gift for Christmas in 12/2010, and have used it once a week since then. It works well when it is working, and as long as you use bread flour the bread comes out nicely. However, the hinges are made of plastic and broke within the first 10 months. This in itself is not a show stopper, as the lid stays in place while making bread, it just won't prop open. Then in 5/2012, after 17 months, the motor started stalling. The good news is that the warranty is 3 years, but the bad news is that there is a $10 fee plus you have to pay return shipping, which is $25 for standard UPS. Customer service was good and I promptly received a replacement unit. 6 months later, in 11/2012, the hinge broke again, and the convection fan went out as well. Based on these experiences, I would NOT buy another Cuisinart product."
4,Does everything it claims well,"Works well as advertised. Seems well constructed, with stainless exterior. Loaf size is a bit weird, as is usual with most breadmakers. I usually just make dough and then bake in convection oven with regular loaf pan. But it does have a huge range of choices for different kinds of bread."
1,On my second one!?!?!,Just recieved my replacment...1st one only lasted three loafs then major issues. The kneading cycle rocked the machine and the mixing bowl would not stay in place.The paddle looked like it was not fitting corectly or somehting and the pan would shake/rock lose. Just got the replacment and made a loaf today no issues.....Amazon deserves credit for the easy return process.....Update Februrary 2011-same issue as with previous maker. Pan is jumping of during kneading have to stand over the maker during kneading to put the pan back in place every few seconds!
1,"Got 2 good loaves, then it went to heck",The first two loaves were great. Then they got terrible. wouldn't rise. The 6 loaf - the machine sounded like a wrecking machine. It's a lot of money for 2 good loaves of bread. Don't buy it.
1,Broken in less than 6 months,"We purchased this unit in April 09. At first I absolutely loved it. It makes great bread. Easy and user friendly. I liked that you can remove the blade (when you remember)But, after about 6 months the plastic hinges that holds the lid in place have cracked and broken off so it no longer stays in place. Each time we open the bread maker it falls off. Since it is really hot you easily get burned.I called Cuisinart today to request a replacement. Well it is going to cost me. They charge you for shipping you a new unit and then you have to send the old one back at your own expense. I can tell you it can get expensive since the product alone weighs 25 pounds.I am extremely disappointed and I will not purchase another Cuisinart product."
2,Can't make Wheat,"At first I thought I was doing something wrong, or maybe my yeast was bad. Nope. I ditched the bread machine and made it by hand using the same yeast and same recipes and put it in the oven and the bread comes out perfect. I followed the recipes in the book that it came with perfectly. It made some basic white bread recipes ok, but cannot make wheat worth a darn. The paddle does not reach the corners. The loaves come out hard and crusty on the outside (I've also played with different crust settings), and mushy on the inside. I cannot experiment anymore and waste anymore ingredients."
2,Junk...do not waste your money,"I ended up returning this item. It made a clump vs a loaf of bread. After two uses it simply Quit. No power. It is also more noisy then the 2 o'clock freight train. I spent more money on an exchange and got a zojirushi. what a great decision! Also, cudos to amazon's return procedure."
2,Does not seem to bake it on time. Followed one of the recipes and did not come out well,The breadmaker took longer than the timer said. It did not come out very well and certainly is not worth what I spent on it
1,A design disaster,"Complete garbage. The ultra thin baking container shakes itself out of its fixing and burns the bottom of the loaf. The paddle is not fixed in any way and so gets embedded in the loaf unless you remove it before the heating cycle. The machine looks pretty compared with the Panasonic, but the Panasonic is well made and works fine every time."
1,Do Not Order From Etronics,"This item was promised to be here by December 26, 2006, it is now January 20,2007 and we have not yet received the elusive Bread Machine. I will never shop with Etronics again!!!!! Count on it. It was a Christmas present for my wife."
2,Bread Pan pops up,"Got this as a gift and the first time I tried to use it the bread pan kept popping up off of the paddle drive. Some tweaking of the tabs was in order, but for the second loaf it still popped up. It isn't automatic by a long shot, and is definitely not worth the hundred bucks street price. Buy a bread maker from a reputable Japanese company instead."
1,Cuisinart Bread Maker,"This bread maker is the worst one I have ever used. Not long after the 30 day return period expired, every loaf I made sank. Tried every tip in the book to no avail. Had to pay an extra $30 in postage to send it back and receive a new one. The replacement one was defective as well. The bread pan wouldn't completely lock in once the machine started up. At least this time I didn't have to pay shipping to send it back. Now I'm waiting for a third replacement. That's what you get for buying something made in China. Doesn't matter how great the brand name is."
1,"Extremely Disappointed, even after Trying Again","I was so excited to receive my breadmaker. The first time I used it, I couldn't pull the bread pan out of the maker. So I had to use a spatula to get the baked bread out. I sent it back. Amazon was really good about sending me a brand new one at no cost to me.However, after baking three loaves, I'm ready to return the second one. The machine is SO loud, no one can talk in the kitchen or dining room when it's working. I am no exaggerating. One night I programmed it to make bread in the AM...it awakened me at 3:30....my bedroom is upstairs. I'm frustrated and totally disappointed and can't believe I have to go through a second return. Doesn't Cuisinart test these machines before boxing them up??? Or does Amazon buy overstock ""lemons""??"
1,Maybe it's the high altitude...,"Maybe it doesn't work as well in high altitude (Denver) but I have tried to make an edible loaf of bread out of this thing many times with no success. The loaf is either a brick or raw. Following the recipes exactly or making modifications according to the rather vague high altitude instructions didn't help. Besides, it is not all that hard to bake bread from scratch without a bread maker and you don't have funny shaped loaves with a hole in the bottom of them."
2,Not for making wheat breat.,"We recently purchase this machine and just sent it back as we could not get it to make a decent wheat loaf. It made white and gluten-free loaves just fine, but it over cooked the wheat bread. It also did not mix the bread very well. If you are wanting a easy put the mix in and wake up to fresh loaf of bread this is not the machine to purchase."
3,Slow mixing,This product takes a while to mix and doesn't get dry ingrediants from the corners very well. If you put in the water first it helps. Overall long mix cylces compared to other models.
4,Excellent for Gluten Free,"I used this machine exclusively for Gluten Free bread. It has a Gluten Free setting. At first I thought machine was defective because when I pushed the Start button nothing happened. It turns out that the Gluten Free setting (and some others) start by warming the ingredients before any mixing occurs. So far I have been using Gluten Free Pantry's Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix. The 22 oz box makes a two pound loaf. Every loaf has been wonderful. One feature that I don't care for is that it keeps the bread warm for an hour after the baking cycle has completed. In theory this keeps the steam from condensing and creating a soggy crust. In practice this causes the crust to get even darker, which I don't care for. Another plus for this machine is that it is easy to get replacement pans and paddles from Cuisinart and they charge a very price."
1,Won't try it again..,"I received my first breadmaker and had problems with it making a lot of noise. I checked how I inserted the bread bowl, tightened, etc. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. After having my son and husband try to get it in tighter, having no success, I decided to get it replaced. Amazon was fantastic. They sent me a new one and it had the same problem. I contacted Cuisenart. They listened over the phone and said it was definitely not supposed to sound like that so I sent it back again. Amazon was wonderful. I traded it in for a different model. I won't try this brand again."
3,Ok machine with some flaws,"This bread maker came with a lot of useful information and recipes and everything worked well at first, but I wish that the machine was a little better made. I make bread almost every day and am now on my 3rd pan for the breadmaker. Clearly this is something they know about since it is an accessory that you can easily purchase from the Cuisinart web site. I would much rather have paid for a more expensive machine that used quality parts, but that doesn't seem to be the case here (my first bread maker was a Black and Decker one that last for nearly 10 years). This one is approaching a year old, needs yet another pan, and is starting to squeak loudly, which is annoying if you're using it make bread for first thing in the morning.In summary:the pros:looks nicegood recipes and baking informationworks well, if you don't use it oftenthe cons:shoddy partsgets noisy after a whiledoesn't lastparts could wind up costing more than an new breadmakerHTH"
4,Outstanding!,"I have had other bread machines, but none quite like this beauty!It is so very easy to make terrific bread, now I do not even buy bread.The downside, it is large and during the mixing and kneading process, very noisy. Fortunately my laundry room/pantry adjoins the kitchen. I fill the bread maker pan in the kitchen, then put it into the machine and close the kitchen door. Perfect bread every time! The cookbook that came with it is great also."
2,Unhappy Baker,"This is my 3rd breadmachine and because I purchase lots of Cuisinart products I thought it would be great. Not true - as it burns the bread on every cycle! Also, the right baking pan clamp screw got stripped after only 2-3 times, and it is now nearly impossible to seat the baking pan inside, so it will engage - just to make the dough! I am very disapointed, as I love homemade bread."
1,CUSINART CBK200 LB CONVECTION BREAD MAKER,I Purchased this item from a local store - I tried it 3 times and the bread was awful - makes a loud noise while operating and bread is too thick and heavy. I love cusinart but this is a dud.
2,Returned it for another,"I had this machine only about 3 weeks before it stopped working. One minute it was plugged in. I unplugged it for about an half an hour then plugged it back in and nothing. It was completely dead. Nothing worked. The digital display showed nothing,there were no lights on. Dead. I tested the outlet, tried different outlets, nothing.I was already disappointed with the machine. The low carb cycle cooked too long and we had to remove the bread before the bake cycle ended to keep it from burning. The French bread came out so hard that it was impossible to bite into. I am returning it an getting a different bread machineI gave this product 2 stars instead of one because of the great customer service I got from Cuisinart. It has a three year warranty. I would not hesitate to purchase another Cuisinart product just not this one."
2,"Too loud, unpredictable bread","This thing is louder than a Sherman tank. I bought it from an Amazon-owned site that is a *hoot* to shop on, so it was a refurb. That said, we had to get rid of this one because it was way too loud. We like to awake to bread in the morning, and this thing was so loud it would wake up the dead. Also, the bread made from the recipes in the instruction manual was just average at best."
2,Not worth the money,I made four loaves with this machine and ended up selling it and buying the Zojirushi. It's too fussy and the flour would often stick to the sides and not mix. The Zojirushi is twice as much but has two paddles and so far I have made 3 perfect loaves of bread. So if you want to save some money and you don't mind fussing with the machine and the contents then get this one but if you just want to dump everything in and walk away spend the extra dough (pun intended) and get the Zojirushi.
2,"Great for dough cycles, but burns bread!","I love this machine for the dough cycles, especially the Artisan Bread Dough Cycle. We love making these breads and dipping them in seasoned olive oil. However, anytime I have tried to use this machine from start to finish, the crust has come out way too dark. If I try to bake any kind of bread with a higher sugar content (like Panettone), the crust actually burns!!! So, I use my 12 yr. old Panasonic to actually bake bread. I just bought my daughter a ZO for her birthday. I think I might just treat myself with one of those myself!"
2,Cuisinart CBK-200 Convection Bread Maker,"Have used several different types of breadmakers and have excellent Cuisinart Products so wanted to try their machine. Two problems that I see make this machine not one I would recommend. One is having to retrieve the paddle from the raw dough... if you are there when it beeps! Or, alternatively having the whole paddle baked into the loaf so solidly getting it out can ruin the appearance of the loaf. The second problem is the actual baking, I think this machine bakes too high and too fast making the bread (very often) sink or overcooked which means unless it is used as soon as it finishes baking it already has a stale dryness to it. I did eventually reach passable results by making sure the water was quite warm and setting the machine to work in the coldest room in the house with the fan switched on to reduce any humidity. I am replacing the machine and am disappointed that I am having to do so. My advice is to try another brand."
3,Good,"It is a good machine. I just wish I could stop the beeping. It would be nice if there was a choice of turning the beeping off if you don't need to add anything to the bread.I thought the quality inside the machine was going to be better than it is, but I have to say that it does make good bread."
2,Cuisinart Bread Machine,"My first machine was a small Panasonic, so I'm not new to making bread. I like all of the features of the Cuisinart, but the machine is very noisy with very loud klunks. That doesn't bother me, but the problem I have is that no matter what cycle I use, with the light crust setting, the machine always burns the bread. The bread looks great until about the last 15 minutes, then the coils get red hot and my loaf turns black. Today, instead of cinnamon bread I pulled out a black hockey puck. This is very disappointing. I'm going to try to exchange the machine for another one and hope for better luck because the features are very nice, the pan is non-stick, and the beeps to alert you to ad mixing ingredients and to remove the paddle are number one on my list. Perhaps the quality control does need some attention, but I'll keep trying until I get a good machine."
1,Trouble with design,"My family purchased this machine as a gift since I was baking so much bread in the old machine I had found from our wedding. The first thing you will notice with this machine is it is VERY LOUD! I got used to that and was enjoying the bread it produced. Then the bread pan kept popping up during kneading; you have to pause the machine and put the pan back in, so you have to stand in front of the loud thing for ages. Next the motor started to seize; you have to manually un-stick the motor! I called customer service and they sent me a replacement. The new one worked fine for a while but the bread pan started popping out again. I called customer service and they sent a new bread pan. That lasted for a couple of cycles, but has now started popping up again!!! I will call them one more time to let them know that this machine has serious design flaws. My husband thinks it is because I use it way more than the average customer, but I feel if it is made well, there should not be problems!"
4,Great bread maker.,"I was a little concerned about some of the mixed reviews on this bread machine, but I bought it anyhow, and I love it. I specifically wanted a bread maker that had a gluten-free cycle, and it makes great GF bread, as well as making more normal types of bread as well. I find that it works best to set the crust setting to ""Light"", because I find that the middle setting cooks a bit dark, and I imagine that ""Dark"" would verge on burnt. I've made at least 8 loaves of bread since I got the machine, and they've all turned out well. (The least tasty were due to deficiencies in my own recipe modifications.)As far as the bad reviews go, it sounds like there might be some QA/QC problems at the factory, but I'm very happy with the unit I got."
1,Broke on Second Loaf,I used this product to make pizza dough the first day I got it. I was making two large batches(2 lbs). On the first batches I was forced to scrap the flour from the corners to incorporate it and on the second loaf the unit died because the paddle was too weak to push the knead the dough. I have a lot of Cuisinart products which I love but clearly this product was not made to the typical standards. I have used numerous other bread makers which worked much better than these. There is a much more limited selection of bread makers today and because Cuisinart is a typically good brand I choose them; clearly a bad decision in this case.
1,Disappointing Bread Maker,"My husband bought me this bread machine for Christmas and I am going to return it. I made two recipes from the book they provided and both were disasters. The paddle does not reach the ingredients on the side of the machine and when I did the second loaf and actually scraped down the sides in the knead cycle, the bread came out hard as a rock and burnt - even though it was on the medium loaf color setting. Horrible. I have always baked bread myself and I thought this would be an easy alternative. My definition of easy is putting the ingredients in and not having to worry about it until the bread is done.On the upside and the only positive thing I can say about this thing is that our place smelled wonderful while the bread was baking."
1,"Maybe I got a dud, but...","this unit was a major disappointment for me. About 75% of the time I use bread machines, I use the dough cycle and make specialty bread. This was the case with my first time with this unit. I needed to make a large quantity, so I had my two Panasonic units as well as my new Cuisinart for the job. All three were given the same ingredients, in the same quantities and put on the dough cycle. At the end of the appointed time, I had two nice pans of dough (the Panasonic units), and one pan (in the Cuisinart) of soupy paste, with half an inch of unmixed flour along one side of the pan and a smaller amount along the other sides. I had followed the directions, but it was just a flop. I was able to salvage the dough by hand mixing and letting it rise, but that is hardly what one expects to have to do when one owns bread machines. Again, maybe I got a dud, but this unit was a major disappointment."
2,"Burns bread--poor build quaility, included recipe books needs a QC","I think this machine was rushed to the market too quickly. The bread machine has a plethora of nifty features, but the build quality is noticeably poor (ours came with a dented handle and lid screws that were inserted in a crooked fashion.) It burns any ""fancy bread"" (we had good results with one loaf out of five and that loaf was plain-Jane French bread), and the recipe book needs a good quality control check. The first recipe we attempted, cinnamon bread, did not include adding any liquid ingredients. I watched the paddle sift dry ingredients like a monkey stares at a basketball until my wife improvised and added a little liquid to the mix. Regardless of her valiant efforts, that loaf turned out looking something like a dense door stop. Forgive me, but while I shop for a better bread machine, Cuisinart may try going back to the drawing board."
1,Quality seriously lacking!,"I bought this machine partly because of the name - Cuisinart, known for a good product - and partly because of the gluten-free setting. The gluten-free breads always sunk. The first machine died after about 1 year and the replacement machine lasted about 1 1/2 years. Definately not worth the money. Something is seriously lacking in the quality of this machine."
2,Cuisinart Convection Breadmaker Avoid it!,After 7 loafs of bread the machine stopped kneading. Contacted Cuisinart and machine is just out of warranty. They do not repair machines and sell no parts to repair the mechanism ie belts.Basically told me to junk it. Cuisinart is not the brand they once were and now mass produce in China with little quality control or service.
2,Poor bread maker,"Tried two loafs. The first (cinnamon raisen Gluten Free) didn't seem to rise during the rise cycle, and didn't seem to rise during baking. Turned into a heavy strange tasting loaf. The Second loaf was standard white bread. Unfortunately, it fell during baking and the machine burned several sections on the sides and bottom. I believe the temperature of the machine was off. Mixing is poor as there was a lot of flour in the corners that never got mixed into the dough. Either way, not worth the money, especially when there are better machines available."
1,"MAJOR problem--the kneader ""sheds"" pieces of itself in to the bread","If you don't mind cutting a 3inch squar out of your finished product, just to get all the GRAY COLORED bread (seriously...it comes off of the kneading attachment)out of your finished baked good, by all means buy this thing. It works well, easy to use, but about 1/4 of your loaf will have to be discarded because of the GRAY MATTER.this has to be a health hazard...I've used this machine several times in the six months since buying it, and I'm ready to give up and buy a new brand all together. Don't waste your money."
2,Another one with pan problems,"I bought this because I have other Cuisinart items that I like. I was a bit worried about the comments with the pan not staying in but figured it couldn't be too bad as my 16 year old Panasonic didn't even have anything to hold it down, it just dropped in and worked. Boy, was I wrong- after a month my wife could get it to hold in place after about 5 minutes of fiddling around. Now, neither of us can get it to stay, I force the end of the handle through one of the hold down holes and leave it at that. Not great but it kind of works. Otherwise, I am happy with everything else about it but I'm afraid I'm advising not to buy one, it's definitely not worth the hassle."
2,Stay Away,"I've just tossed this breadmaker and bought a different brand. The first few loaves I did (sweet breads) burned on the bottom and cooked unevenly. I saw this in previews reviews, but I played the odds, and unfortunately, I got a bad breadmaker. I followed the recipes to the ""T."" I have since made other loaves (not sweet)...white, wheat, etc. They come out much better and I definitely don't have the burning issue. However, I want a breadmaker that I can use for all purposes. I would recommend that you stay away from this one. Not to mention, the customer service at Cuisinart is terrible."
1,Bread pan will no longer snap into place,I have only had this machine for 2 years and seriously it has only been used maybe a dozen times. The bread pan will no longer snap into the machine. As a matter of fact I can't even push it down below the snap clips. I don't know if it is the bread pan or the machine. My husband has even tried to no avail. I am so dissapointed in Cuisinart...
2,"More Than ""One Flaw""","I received this item as a Christmas gift. I tried to use it right away. All was going well, until the dough started to get thicker and then the pan continuously popped out of place. I did some research on the problem and found that many many people had the same issue. The good thing is, I called cuisinart (open everyday of the year!) and they are shipping me another one. I do have to pay shipping back.I will update this after I get the new one!"
5,Great User Friendly Product,"I have had this machine for a little over a month, and have made about 15 loaves of bread. There were certainly a few that came out less than perfect to start with, but as you learn how to use the machine, you end up with great tasting bread every time. Making sure you follow directions and use the right ingredients is key. I was hesitant after reading several of the reviews, but most of the issues appear to be user error. The metal clips that hold the bread pan in place are somewhat of a conern as they are not perfectly aligned on my unit, but I haven't had any issues with the pan coming loose while kneading. Overall I am very pleased with this product and would reccomend it."
5,Works great,The product works great - I have had many successful loaves of bread of different types from the unit - Amazon as usual did great
3,I read a lot of reviews....,"I love having a bread machine. I think I misunderstood the concept of ""quiet"" because I think this is loud. It is my first bread machine so I have no comparison but my kitchen is separate from my TV room and it is disruptingly loud. My son came downstairs to see what noise was. On the other hand, I have made two loaves of bread that my family seems to love."
2,A machine you should only use once a month,"I have owned this machine for 3 years and for the first year and a half it worked beautifully. I used it at least once a week and took good care of it, following the maintenance instructions. It stopped working and Cuisinart replaced it for the cost of shipping the faulty one back. I used the new machine for another year and half, using it once a week and taking good care of it. I used the machine for the dough cycle mostly, baking it in a loaf pan because I like the shape better and it still stopped working! When I asked Cuisinart, they wouldn't replace it because the original machine is out of warranty. I have been unable to get a full warranty period out of once machine. I would not use this bread maker if you plan to actually make bread with it."
1,Terrible product,Pan pops out.Just got a replacement pan.STILL POPS OUT.A total waste of money!I would not buy it.
2,Ok...but...,"I was given the Cuisinart Breadmaker as a gift from Williams Sonoma. The first one burned the bread on the bottom, so I returned it for another. This one bakes the bread better, but when in the kneading cycle, the bread basket becomes dislodged from the motion and I have to pause the machine to push it back down. This is really frustrating because I have to do it several times before the cycle is over...therefore I can't start it and leave for a while. Does anyone else have this problem?"
1,not happy,this bread maker does not cook bread evenly. burnt edges while not cooked in the middle. very dissappointed.
1,poor design,"I purchased this machine as a present for my wife. On the first attempt to make bread, the machine sounded like a threshing machine. Of course the bread was a failure. The pan had come loose from the cup it sits in. On the second and third attempts, the mixing paddle came loose and embedded itself in the loaf of bread. In all tries the pan came loose from the mixing cup on the spindle and the machine had to be put on pause and the pan reseated. I DID NOT purchase this from amazon. Now I wish I had since I cannot get any satisfaction from the company where I purchased it."
2,I returned it,"Have an old Pillsbury machine of my mother-in-law's that makes a better loaf than this one. I wanted the bigger, horizontal loaf, so that's why I decided to order the Cuisinart. Can't get this one to vary the thickness/lightness of the crust at all. It's always too heavy/dark. The size of the pan really needs two kneading paddles. As it is, with one paddle, there are lots of dips and swirls even in plain old white bread, which should have an even texture. Never had a loaf absolutely fail, but for the money, the size, & the claims made by the manufacturer, this one should work better. Thanks to Amazon's great return policy, I was able to return it with no hassle at all."
3,"OK, but not great","This breadmaker seems to do a good job making various bread products but the quality and craftsmanship of the machine itself is below average. The first one we received was defective in that the vessel that holds the dough would shake loose and rattle around the inside. Amazon was awesome in exchanging the first one, and we shortly received a second one. The second machine works better but the top control panes is not properly attached to the main part of the machine. My opinion is that the design of the breadmaker is good but the quality control and craftsmanship is not so hot. We will use it until it breaks then probably get another brand."
1,"Looks pretty, but that's it","I have had this breadmaker for over a year and have never been happy with it. Even on the light crust setting, all the bread is well done. It advertises that it can make 2 lb loafs, but they really can't fit - several recipes will be overstuffed in there and the bread does not have enough room to properly rise. Mine just broke and I'm glad that I can get a new one by some other company other than cuisinart. Their other products are good, but this bread maker is just terrible."
1,A Chinese Junk,"I have had two bad machines in less than a year, and I only bake about 4 loaves of white bread a month. The second machine was furnished under the warranty and cost me $33.33 for shipping. It wasn't worth the shipping cost since the motor stopped kneading in only three months. I could have shipped it back to Cuisinart for an ""evaluation"" and possibly another replacement for the cost of shipping. It wasn't worth the trouble since, in my view, this model is a piece of Chinese junk."
3,"looks nice, but too noisy","pros:- look- pre-warm cyclecons:- very very noisy. There is so metal noise when the bladed is moving, can't really use the timer delay overnight.- crust too hard"
2,Poor Design - works well for a while,"For as long as it lasts the CBK-200 works fairly well. The normal crust setting seems too hard for wheat bread, but light works as long as you still like a rather substantial crust. Maybe it works better with lighter breads. The little paddle doesn't look like it mixes very well, but eventually seems to get the job done. A wooden spoon helps get the flour stuck in the corners, but probably isn't really needed.A major flaw is that the large secondary belt driven gear is very cheap plastic held to the shaft by friction. Since bread dough is usually very stiff, the gear will eventually start slipping, rendering the machine completely worthless. Taking off the bottom plate and tightening the shaft bolt may help a little, but the cheap plastic of the gear will eventually give way. There doesn't seem to be any service parts available, making this a ""use for a while and then throw away appliance"". Purchased at Ross for $40, which seems like a good price for the quality."
2,Cusinart CBK-200,"I purchased this breadmaker approximately two years ago. Since that time, I used it once or twice a week, but not every week. About 6 months ago, the paddle assembly began to deteriorate. It is now totally inoperable. When I contacted Cusinart about the problem, they indicated that they would replace the paddle assembly upon payment of a fee of $23.00 plus shipping. I do think that given the cost of the breadmaker the life expectancy of an operable appliance should be more than two years, especially with intermittent use. Given the short span of use and with Cusinart's response, I certainly won't buy another Cusinart breadmaker and will reconsider purchasing Cusinart's products, especially if the company is not willing to stand behind its quality."
1,breadman,poor product---soon ---7days after use the control board stuck . the heat element is not adequate and I am disappointed ..........
2,Not sold on this breadmaker,"The Cuisnart CBK 200. I have not been able to make a light loaf of bread. All of the loaves turn out very dense. Even after closely following the instructions. Customer service told me to add more liquid after the 1st kneading, the loaf is still very dense. Not sure if I just have a defective machine. Very disappointed, I love all Cuisinart prodcuts but am unable to make this work correctly."
3,"Okay, but if you are making gluten-free...",...the bread always falls on me. I keep trying to adjust the recipe. Works REALLY good for dough. Okay on the regular breads that they include in there recipe book. Have not tried there gluten free recipes.
4,Great Price,"Great price, top quality. Saw in retail stores cheaper but then upon further investigation realized they were plastic case and not stainless like this one."
4,"Amazon ""error""","List price for this item on the Cuisinart Website is $129. Yes, free shipping makes it a good deal from Amazon, so why lie about the price discount?"
2,Cuisinart CBK-200 Burns Bread....,"I purchased the Cuisinart CBK-200 a week ago and couldn't wait to get it out of the box. Unfortunately, my first two loaves came out with burned sides and bottom and a fairly dark top crust(even on the lightest setting). After googling reviews on this bread maker, I found out that numerous customers had the same faulty issue with the Cuisinart CBK-200 and had to return it. I guess I'm in the same boat. Too bad! Cuisinart makes some great products, just not this one. Would not recommend."
4,Excellent bread machine,I am very pleased with my new Cuisinart bread machine. My husband is wild for the Honey Wheat bread that I make for him. The only thing I am disappointed in is there are no receipes for Rye bread. I would have given the product 5 stars if there were rye bread receipes.
2,yikes packaging,bread machine arrived in box much larger than bread maker box = 2 pieces of paper inside resulting in no cushioning transit. Box is damaged. This is for a present - now unsure if it will even work ... so disappointing.
1,Choose something other than this bread machine,"We received this machine as a gift two years ago. We noticed right away this machine was so loud! Much louder than our old Hitachi bread machine. The bread is always inconsistent with this machine, too. The crust is incredibly thick and tough. We've been making our own bread for five years now, so we are experienced bread makers. We had to tweak and tweak our recipes to get them to turn out right, and even then we never knew what we'd get. We gave up ever finding a whole wheat recipe to work in this machine. The seal on the bottom of the pan gave out this week. Instead of just ordering a replacement pan, we're ditching this machine to find something better. It's definitely not worth the $200 price tag my mother-in-law paid."
1,I am having trouble liking this bread maker!,"I agree with the negative review that is prominent on the page here. I have make 10 loaves at this point and not ONE has turned out correctly, or even tasty. I have made bread for many years and have had no problems with other machines or in doing so by hand. I wanted a bread maker to make the process simplified thus allowing me to have home made bread for my family more often. This machine has made me so frustrated and I just want to return it, which I am going to do tomorrow. I don't need to go into details, but suffice to say my loaves do not rise, do not cook properly and I saw a crow trying to lift a piece I threw in the backyard for the birds and he couldn't get it off the ground. Ha! I am finished with this machine."
4,"Lovin' It In Tombstone, AZ","I recently purchased this bread machine and it's a very high quality machine. I like the fact that it beeps to alert me to be able to remove the paddle to eliminate ""that hole"". It does a great kneading job. It has many choices and I like using the various sizes, 1 lb., 1 1/2 lb. or 2 lb. and light, medium or dark crust. And of course the 'dough only' cycle is great too and will be handy for pizza dough. It's quick and easy to operate, a breeze to clean, doesn't heat up the kitchen area, cools quickly, keeps it warm if that option is chosen. It has a delayed start. Happy I purchased this brand and am purchasing other Cuisinart products; ""you get what you pay for""."
5,Heavy Duty and Gluten Free,Heavy Duty machine that includes gluten free recipes. Has quite a few interesting recipes in addition to bread such as jam and jellies!
1,Burned crust & noisy convection fan,"The first loaf I made in this machine was baked on the medium crust setting. The resulting crust was hard, thick, and burned. The second loaf I tried was baked on the light crust setting. The results were similar--hard, thick, and burned, although not quite as black as the medium setting. Another drawback to this machine is the convection fan which can be quite noisy.On the plus side, the kneading paddle operates at a relatively slow speed and doesn't throw flour all over the interior, especially when adding additional. The beeper feature for removing the paddle is a thoughtful touch. Not only do you not have a paddle imprint in the loaf, but the paddle is much easier to clean than when it bakes in the loaf. Though not essential, I also liked the side handles.Overall, this machine is unacceptable. Burned bread just doesn't fill the bill."
1,A machine designed by idiots.,This machine is designed by idiots. The bread pan pop out during kneading and pan stuck in the machine after making only two loafs of bread. You will definitely regret if you buy this machine.
2,Broke down prematurely,"I used mine for about 3 years, an average of once or twice a month, so definitely less than 100 times before the motor broke down. I'm disappointed. Until then, the machine performed well."
3,Mixed results,"This is a run-of-the mill bread maker... not really worthy of the Cuisinart name. I'd say about 1/3 of the time, my loafs fail. My prior westinghouse maker was actually better!"
1,What a disappointment. Did I get a lemon?,"I was so looking forward to this machine. I am a long time machine bread maker and have had two other brands with not a problem. First, Yes it burns the crust on MED; Second, I made 4, count them, four batches of their recipe bread and my recipe bread and they were ALL awful. Could not believe it. Each time I followed the reciped and instructions to the letter.I'm giving up the ghost and going back to my el cheapo bread machines that work every time. Love the style and the loaf shape of the Cuisinart but don't like wasting my time and ingredients. Maybe I got a lemon."
1,Defective machine - burns bread everytime,"This machine is defective - unless you like burned bread, don't buy it. Even on the lightest setting, it burns the crust. It makes nice dough, but that's about all."
1,Very disappointed.,"Twice I followed the recipe for basic bread and ended up with an inedible result. I especially took great care the second time with measurements and temperature. I consider myself an experienced baker, and have not had problems with other machines."
2,Okay machine with a serious fault,The machine does the job. But the bowl dislodges off in midst of mixing and does not stay in its grove. So basically you have to hold it for an hour. I wish they had groves with locks to hold the bowl.
2,re-manufactured,"I knew I was buying re-furbished machine, But it had some issues that should have been addressed. The legs are uneven, so it does not sit flat on the counter and kneading causes it to rock. Some of the buttons stick and it came somewhat dirty. It is working well however and so the trade off is a few bucks for a few quirks."
2,Great until you need parts.,"Bakes a great loaf of bread, but at one to two loaves a week for a few months the pan wore out (the paddle would no longer turn).Try to order the part.Go ahead, I'll wait. The part number is CBK-PAN.You can't get one from the manufacturer or anyone else.If you do find one, I'll buy it for $89.UPDATE: they've started producing parts for this since I wrote the review. It took three months to get the mixing bowl.The machine has some great features, but if the company can't reliably and readily produce parts, then it is a paperweight until they can."
5,Exelent product!!,Convection Automatic Breadmaker This is great!I put all the ingredients in the machine at night and I program for the bread is ready at 6am and woke already made &#8203;&#8203;a delicious fresh baked bread!It's amazing!
2,Believe the bad reviews.,"I just returned this bread machine (CBK-200) after using it for 1 month and about 7 loaves.It made the standard whole wheat breads well.However, when I tried making the ""sweet"" breads, it burned the sides and bottom. I'm an experimenter so I tried several different adjustments without much improvement. This problem seems to be common based on other reviews.The last straw was when I was cleaning it and simply lifted the door, the plastic hinge broke on the right side. It is clear from the design that it is made in a way that should allow you to ""easily"" remove the lid for cleaning. The problem is that it also easily breaks - again, seems to be a common problem.So, the 2 stars is for not being able to handle sweet breads, possibly others too, and poor quality (i.e. the plastic hinge breaks easily)."
2,Cuisinart CBK-200,The fit and finish isn't very good. The ridged looking strip along the upper side is actually put on with adhesive and mine has ripples that really stand out...I've tried baking five loaves and four of them have fallen. I don't know if that is an issue with the machine or the mix but I've tried different yeasts and various amounts.
2,Disappointing,"I have used bread machines since the late '80s and this one is the least reliable. I am careful to select the right size loaf, but the bread is almost always overcooked. I don't trust the recipes because so many of the ones I have tried are way too dry.I do not recommend this machine or the recipe book that comes with it."
5,Great bread machine,"Cuisinart Bread Maker is very easy to use, with complete instructions and even a timing chart so that you don't have to sit near the unit to add ingredients. I especially like the signal to remove the ""paddle"" as the bread then has no hole in the bottom. Only complaint is that the crust (even in light) is too dark and hard - but that might be the bread being made."
5,Sapphire Pendant in Sterling Silver,It was exactly what I was looking for. I have diamond/sapphire/white gold earrings which match with the necklace. I could not afford the matching necklace which ran upwards of $2000. It is well made and was shipped very promptly. It is a wonderful addition to my jewelry box!
5,On the wings of an angel,"Ange- Au Dela du Delire. I once heard there was a French prog band who made an album called ""The Gates of Delirium"" just before Relayer came out. Looking around on the Internet, I figured it must have been this band and this album. I promptly splurged something like $35 to buy the imported version from some ripoff CD dealer, but man am I glad I did. This album just creates an alternate universe distinct from all the British groups, but of course bearing quite a few similarities. But what sets Ange apart is singer Christian Decamps and the most unreal organ sound of all time. Such passion in the vocals here, and although I don't understand a word of it (ok, maybe a couple here or there, and I know ""Fils de Lumiere"" means ""Son of Light""), it still affects me. Maybe it's good that I don't understand what the hell he's talking about since it would probably ruin the emotive aspect. It's so amazing to see this on Amazon for $5 so many years later...."
2,what? Theatrical prog rock?,"This group was a complete disapointment to me (along with Pulsar and Novalis). After reading a lot about how good they were i gave them a listen and it is NOT for every prog rock fan...So watch out! There is some terrible singing in here and also no great musicianship as some say. This is, my opinion of course ...but if you think of Prog Rock and bands like Yes, PFM, Area, ELP, Bruford, Hatfield and the north, etc come to your mind, . then this may not be to your liking...Give this a listen before buying!!"
5,Quite Possibly the Best Reading of Beethoven's Symphony No 9,"A crisp, faithful reading made possible by Barenboim's genius. This is something to treasure."
3,"About time, but dissapointing","This live recording features many of PH better songs.Their performance is good, but the sound mix is awful at times. Unfortunately that takes the edge of many numbers."
1,A Piece of Crap,"When you're a big time rock star, you get to get away with junk like this. Ever the meticulous craftsman in the studio, Young took his first take work ethic to new lows with this garbage. No one really cares what the motivatiuons were for this dismal run through of simply stupid material, if you were dumb enough to buy it on vinyl, there's no need to attempt to resurrect your pride extolling this slagheap as an underappreciated masterpiece.YIKES!The musicianship is horrible: remember, this is Crazy Horse: try to imagine how bad horrible Crazy Horse must be. There are no lyrics worth preserving and Young sings like dinner's on the table and he better get in before it gets cold. Thanks, Neil. We all owe you one."
4,good CD,"this CD is a great CD. I have had the LP for some time, and I liked that, so Decided to get into the 21st century and get the CD of this. if you are a Neil Young fan, then you should get this CD."
5,Great underrated album- rocks from begining to end,This has always been one of my favorate albums by Neil Young. Highly underrated. Neil is back in full force with Crazy Horse after recording Hawks and Doves. Re ac tor rocks from begining to end and never misses a beat. Great to see it released in CD form now.
3,Monster Thrash,"Neil Young again throws a curve ball by following up his acoustic and country album Hawks & Doves with 1981's thrashing Re.ac.tor. The album, like its predecessor, was universally panned by the critics upon its release. While the album was definitely thrown together as the last album to fulfill his Warner contract, it captures the raw and trashy energy of Crazy Horse. The songs are clearly just thrown together with little or no lyrical cohesion, but the pure energy and power of the band makes up for any lack of creativity. The epitome of this is song ""T-Bone"" which repeats the same line about mashed potatoes and t-bones over and over for nine plus minutes. But despite the inane lyric, the band's crashing and crunching riffs are mesmerizing. The album's final song ""Shots"" is another standout with a riveting and threatening vibe. For the most part, Re.ac.tor is a hodge-podge of an album and really only for Neil Young aficionados."
4,"""ROCK!"" Review","I liked this review of this album because it really gave me a sense of what the album is all about. The description of the guitar sounds in particular was very helpful to me. However, as much as I enjoyed this review, I don't think other rock albums could ""vote"", per say, for this album to be their king, since kings, technically, are not elected, but generally pre-ordained by birthright or forcibly established with military victories. Still, the point of the review is well taken: this is a great album. And my point is this: that was a great review!"
2,"Man, what a bad record","Sometimes even Neil Young can pinch out a real cowflop. I'm a huge fan, but there are a few records I missed, and I'm going back and filling in the gaps. David Briggs produced this record, so I figured it had to be good. But the songs really suck, totally repetitive garbage. There's a reason why this album vanished beneath the waves. For completists only."
5,Better than you remember,"Re-ac-tor has been much maligned, but this newly remastered CD shows that the criticism is unfounded. My favorite track is ""Shots"", which is arguably the most incendiary song in the Neil Young catalog. This shows two sides of Neil - the beautiful melodies and heart-racing riffs.The lyrics are obscure, even for Neil. But so what? Greendale has good lyrics, but I find the music to be tedious. I'll take good tunes with rousing choruses (like ""Southern Pacific"") over anything new he's released in the last five years."
3,"Got lotsa grunge licks, ain't got no contract","This was the second (and last) of Neil's ""contractual obligation"" LP's he delivered to Reprise. Consisting entirely of studio outtakes, it still manages to lay some of the groundwork that bands from the Pacific Northwest would take to much higher levels. ""Shots"" is a keeper. The rest is for die-hard Neil fans, of which I am one."
2,Baby Doll Poetry,"This is a pretty good book, and Ms. Stallings is a pretty good poet. Her poems are psychologically girlish and nave, but technically competent and musical. Among the bad to mediocre poems in this collection, few were able to move or surprise me. Perhaps because I am too much of a cynic and curmudgeon?Ms. Stallings possesses a minor talent, one that other formalists are seriously lacking: She's blessed with a fine ear and a delicate touch. However, this reader requires more vision and psychological depth from his poets. Tonight I will reach for Richard Moore and Tom Riley.I'll put this book away for my daughter, and I'll give Ms Stallings 2 stars."
5,Flight of the Eagle,"great reading by a great author one i will be keeping an eye on, the whole trilogy was compelling reading."
4,Flight of the Eagle,I ordered this book as a replacement for a copy that has nver found its way back to us. My husband had bought it when we visited Australia and its not easy to find. I wanted to be ableto read it some time.
2,Nik Turner - 'New Anatomy' (Thunderbolt),"Originally released in 1985, this was actually an Inner City Unit album as it was their fourth effort. As huge of fan that I am of Hawkwind and Nik Turner, I hate to admit that Inner City Unit has never done much for me. 'New Anatomy' has been noted as being one of the worst lp's ever made, EVEN by the band members themselves. I wouldn't say that. Tracks that were so-so include ""Young Girls"", ""Forbidden Planet"", ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Birdland"" (probably the best cut on the entire CD). I guess Nik going from playing space rock to playing '80's style punk just didn't fly right. Line-up: Nik - sax & vocals, Dead Fred - bass, keyboards & vocals and Steve Pond - guitar, drums & vocals. Believe that ICU has recently reunited to play some live gigs. Maybe it did fly right, for a few anyway."
5,Strawberry Shortcake bookbag is Great for girls!!!!,My 5 year old picked this bookbag out on her own. She has just started kindergarten on Sept. 6th. This bookbag is too cute. It is big enough for her lunchbox (matching) and all of her school supplies. My kid just loves it.
3,"Cute backpack, but very large for a preschooler.",This is a very durable backpack and very cute! It is too large for a preschooler. It would be more suitable for a school age child.
5,No Problems,I got it when it was promised without any issues. I really wish they would do movies with this guys books.
4,if you like the anima read the manga,i liked it even though i'm not a little kid anymore i still love Yu-Gi-Oh to death! i could just give Yugi a great big hug!
5,Excellent!!!,I really love this book. I especially like the love story between Ken & Joni. The way she writes it--you can really see it from her point of view. They are a cool couple!!
2,This is NOT Clancy,"I wanted to read a book from Alten for a long time. I'm interested on sea adventures, and his books looked promising. I finally picked up Goliath. That wasn't a very good move. This was incredibly boring, to my credit I have to say that I finished the book, but it took a lot of effort. I can't believe people are comparing this to Clancy!. Two starts, just because maybe I picked up the wrong book by this author."
1,You've Got To Be Kiddin',This book was absolutely terrible. It is memorable as one the few books I've ever just thrown away without finishing. Preditable and absurd.Where do I get a refund?
4,Not bad...,"I liked this book. I can't say much about it that hasn't been said already. The characters may be a little shallow and waffle more than a politician right before election day, but overall it's a good sci fi read with none of the blood and guts from the Meg series. I did like the Meg books a little better. However, my biggest complaint is Where is the Sequel? The end of the book promises another book called ""sorceress"". What happened to it? I would like some loose ends wrapped up. Does America continue to act as the World Police? Does Sorceress get out and wreak havoc (probably because some DoD fools come back and try to salvage her instead of nuking her core)? I want to know!"
4,great concept,i liked this book. although the concept has probably been done before i applaud the aurthors imagination. you have a computer built to learn and grow who ultimately believes she is a supreme being. she was built in order to keep the peace and her ultimate solution for doing what she was programmed to do is shocking. very good read.
2,Terrible!!,"Other's have already posted plot summaries so I will skip that. The plot is not too far off target, but the characters are wooden and flat. Thrust into a life threatening situation, former lovers Rocky and Gunnar are allegedly working together to stop terrorists on board Goliath. Unfortunately, Rocky spends her time berating Gunnar for a past offense and preaching the American Way. Meanwhile, Gunnar is too wrapped up in the past, albeit violent and scarring, to appeal to this reader as a wounded hero. She is blinded by patriotism and he is burned out, struggling to get thru the day. The villian, Covah, is written sanctamonious rather than menacing.I've read Alten's other books and this one was boring boring boring."
2,Good read gone average at the end,"Why is it that most books has to end happy? This book was doing well with destruction and nuclear fall out and the author has to ruin everything with the same ol' 'special forces guy doing it again' formula that I am so sick and tired of. It seems that most action/thriller books have a 'super agent' in CIA, FBI, ARMY, NAVY, NSC or some other secret organization that saves the day. I am tired of this scenario and there is nothing really redeeming or fresh about the 'super computer gone crazy' and 'hero saves the day' story. I am disappointed at Steve Alten because I know he is a better writer than this."
4,Military Thriller,"This military thriller about a monster of the United State's own creation is a Science Fiction story with a few realistic scenarios. Alten keeps the pace fast while giving us the technology information needed. This isn't always easy to do in this type of novel, but the author masters it with great skill. This reader nearly sympathized with the villain, Simon Covah, for his initial goal seems like a good one on the surface. However, the reader is shown how easily good intentions can spin out of control when humans play with great power.Chrissy K. McVayAuthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
5,A Rock and Roll Classic for our time!,"This is a book so up to the minute based on our present situation, it makes it very interesting. The imagery portrayed in the book is movie like, and the adventure never stops. The story has elements of Goepolitical mastery, military adventure and scientific science fiction overtones. Steve Alten's Domain starts out very believable with very interesting subjects such as the existence of the ancient nephillim, but soon degenerates and goes over the top with a fantasy element. Not so with Goliath, it sticks to the subject and is a military rock and roll classic!. Do not miss this one!"
1,Faucet broke after 2 years.,Bought this faucet 2 years ago. After 1 year it started to malfunction & last week the end of the faucet broke off. Checked for warranty-replacement parts & Price Pfister said 'not available at this time'....I am very disappointed.
1,Poor quality ---- broke twice,"I love the look of this faucet, I love the functionality of this faucet. I hate that in the 2 years I have owned this faucet, the pullout spray has broken twice. The problrm is a design flaw in the faucet head where you go from stream to spray. There is a plastic piece in there that breaks easily. Our home is not a high maintenance home, just 2 adults. It's not like the faucet was abused. The first time I had to track down the part and it cost me $129 to fix it. Now the piece isn't available, so i'm shopping for a new faucet. Don't Buy this faucet!!!!"
1,over-the-top hollywood liberal propaganda,"The animation was quite lovely in this movie and that is truly the only nice thing I can think to say about it.The story is a predictable, yet over-the-top portrayal of white military guys as genocidal aggressors (except the one who get to change his evil ways) and has the only voices of reason and wisdom coming from woman, a black guy, (and my personal favorite) an alien in in wheelchair! The highlight of the movie is when afore-mention evil-whte military guys murder a (alien flying) whale.If you like having your children exposed to bigoted, nature-worshiping, anti-military propaganda disgusied as children's entertainment than you will love this movie."
5,This movie really rocked as I expected some lame SCI-fi cartoon,I picked up the movie at the free video store shelf at Family Video. It is actually worth paying for and not a FREE movie. The story line is good and it keeps your interest Well Done
5,Awesome movie!,"I watched this movie 3 times back to back, I just couldn't get enough of this movie! Very excellent movie, you won't be disapointed if you watch it!"
1,Was I watching the same move as the others who reviewed this story?,"The story ""Battle for Terra"" is not the animated film one would want their children to see.Mankind has destroyed Earth and two other planets in the solar system because of the desire for independents from each other.Now mankind is on a search for another planet to live on. The first contact with the Terrans is a sneak attack upon their world, a world that has found how to live with nature.A takeover on the rusting old spaceship by a U.S. style military is depicted as the bad guys. The hero in the story, a soldier who turns on and kills the military leaders who are hellbent on destroying the Terrans.It is my opinion that this very colorful animated film has no entertainment value, but an abundance of propaganda it does have."
3,OK.... A bit slow. Rent if you can find it.,"Enjoyed; but it will not become a family favorite (I would be surprised if we ever watch the purchased copy again....) Though it may be hard to find, rent if available."
4,Terra Delivers.,"Battle for Terra is an entertaining and visually impressive animated adventure. The story mixes unique creatures and planet vegetation with a story about peace and the battle over good and evil. This movie came out before Avatar and delivers a creative and unique style in the look and feel of the inhabitants of the new planet and its vegetation and creatures, not unlike that of Avatar.The only downfall I would say is that they don't take enough time to truly develop the ""heroes"" of the story but that being said, the animation delivers a great visual punch that creates an atmosphere of adventure for anyone watching."
4,Avatar might have taken some ideas from this.,"Now before I review the movie, I want to clarify that I don't think James Cameron actually stole ideas from this movie, but Avatar is basically Dances with Wolves and Battle for Terra rolled into one. As for this movie, it was a pleasant surprise. I rented it for my son, because he thought it looked cool. After watching it I realized this was an amazingly done movie with a lot of character and heart. My son said, ""Wow, dad that was really sad."" And when I asked him if he liked it or not he said it was amazing, but just unlike any cartoon he had ever seen. In a way he is right. It was definitely more dramatic than most cartoons I've seen. I definitely recommend this movie to all sci-fi lovers, and who knows maybe anyone will appreciate the simple lesson that it teaches, one that resonates in such movies as Dances with Wolves and Avatar."
4,interesting movie,"honestly, the voice acting is pretty bad. but that aside, the animation and what the story is saying about humanity is great. if you can find it cheap buy it, but at least rent it."
5,Oustanding and thought provoking CGI animated film,"Battle For Terra is a very unusual CGI animated film about Earth invading an alien planet...no, this is not Planet 51 and is not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. It's a serious and inciteful film made over 2 years ago and finally released on DVD. What would we do, if our civilization was reduced to a small group of marauders on a failing generation ship desperate to terraform a planet to save what's left of humanity, even if it would wipe out the indigenous population who breathe a different gas? It's well written, acted and animated. A true labor of love and has a bittersweet ending. I don't recommend it for really young children, but perhaps kids 8 and up could get the story."
3,Very mixed feelings,"The CGI detail of Terra and its inhabitants is first rate. The appearance of humans is like old Disney animation, pathetic. In this movie humans are the genocidal villains attempting to perpetuate the species by tera-forming the planet for human habitation. One of the outtakes explains that some humans disagree with this approach. Hollywood political agenda to discredit the military?No explanation is given for the advanced military hardware of the Terrains. What happened in the past? The lead human has been won over to the peacefulness of the locals yet can’t overcome blindly following orders. In the end he is a hero but what took so long?I liked the movie and I was irritated by it."
5,Must see...for all ages,Really Cool. Worth watching over and over.There are various levels and details to thisand that makes it good viewing for all ages.
1,terrible & cheap animation,"Not worth your time or money, it's animation is on par with those bad CGI Saturday morning cartoons. Complex moving objects in every scene just highlight how poor the art direction was"
2,"That tree has to go, and those little floaty things too.","A heavy handed MESSAGE film set on high for indoctrination. Can't let the little tykes figure things out for themselves. Let's make it perfectly clear (didactic in the extreme): who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? Anyone? You there, in the back row.Personally, I found their approach to the subject matter more troubling than their sloppy sentiment. I like my cartoons a little less brutal, thank you. And why are the villains always the military? A little imagination in that regard would be greatly appreciated.Did I like anything about it? Well. It was pretty to look at. Dazzling in Blu-ray. But it was weird that the little tadpole aliens looked more ""real"" than the plastic looking humans.The little robot easily stole the movie.Not a keeper as I couldn't stand to watch it again...I barely made it through the first sitting!"
5,A Must See,"The reviews for this movie were glowing, so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did, for this is a remarkable movie. It's not only visually stunning, it has a wonderful story. Everyone from children to presidents should watch this movie for the lesson it teaches. We should all take it to heart!"
2,Not much like 'Wave'...,"'Tide' was originally released in 1970 as a sequel to 'Wave', but it was arranged by Eumir Deodato instead of the arranger of Wave, Claus Ogerman. The result is a spastic pop-malange that is more suggestive of North America, not South (-with the exceptions perhaps of the songs 'Tide' and 'Caribe'). If you are seeking more of that etherial, evocative, misty emotion feeling of Wave, you may be dissapointed with 'Tide'."
3,Be prepared to buy more of Strobels books - want to or not.,"Not a bad ""how to"" book on violin making. A bit thin on content and style, with constant references to three other Strobel books on the subject which you are assumed to have purchased. For the total price of all the books you might be better off buying ""The Art of Violin Making"" by Chris Johnson and Roy Courtnall - an outstanding text on the subject."
3,Violin Making Step by Step,"Very helpful in the subjects covered but, for full coverage, companion publications are required. This limits its usefullness while, no doubt, potentially increasing the income of the writer."
3,Very Disappointing.,I was hoping this book seriers would be filled with tribal knowledge for violin makers. Unfortunately they are not. You can do better looking at forums on the web. Only basic information in these books.
4,Haven't read ... but,"I'm a violin building newbee, just starting on my 1st one, and bought ""The Art of Violin Making"" by Chris Johnson and Roy Courtnall, and also bought ""Violin Making, a Practical Guide"" by Juliet Barker. Both of these books are excellent, but if your just buying one, I'd recommend The Art of Violin making, which is a bit more precise, and has aswsom pictures and illustrations of how to build, and fine instruments. Also, there are a lot of luthiers on utube, who show various ways of accomplishing the same thing, using different tools etc. It seems every builder has their own style, approach, and creativity. Both the aforementioned books have all the usefull measurements in them. Eventually, I'll probably buy the Strobel books too, but I'm making my 1st violin without them."
3,good book,"This helped explain a little more but I still could not grasp calculus all together, must just be me. I know without it though I would not have passed the class, even if it was a low grade."
3,Just ok,I bought this as companion to the Calculus for Dummies book. The practice was useful but for me the practice problems were simply too hard. For a more advanced student this might be a good supplement. I found it frustrating.
4,Good transaction,The book came in on time and the supplier was prompt with the whole deal. Actual description described by the seller was what came.Keep it up!
4,Good Practice for Beginning Calculus!,"This workbook is an excellent companion to Ryan's book _Calculus for Dummies_. In fact I might go so far as to say the two should be considered one volume. In this book you'll find the extra exercises and problems that may not have been copious enough in the _Calculus for Dummies_ book alone. And of course he also walks you through the solutions. I might have wished for more problems instead of the space to actually work them in the text, but that is a minor detail. Overall this is part of a set that serves as an excellent introduction / preview / study aide to beginning calculus. Although I suppose this work could be used alone by someone just wanting to brush up on their calculus via some worked problems. Either way its a good buy."
3,Calculus for Dummies is Not for Dummies,"I used this book to brush up on my Calculus before the CSET, however this book was only a gloss over of what Calculus really is. This book is more about memorizing techniques and methods, than learning what Calculus really means and represents. I have my BA in Math and would only recommend this book to people who have substantial background in math, but need to brush up on the concepts."
5,Great review book for keeping your calculus skills sharp,"Just graduated from high school. I took calculus my senIor year and really liked it. I'm going to college this fall and I'll be taking calc I first semester. I needed something to keep my calculus skills and mindset over the summer, this book does the job. I just do a few problem sets from each chapter/section every week during my spare time. Great problem book."
2,This heroine needs to be strangled!,"I hated this book! I thought that the heroine acted like an idiot. Not that the hero didn't, both of them tried to be so upstanding and moral. Give me a break! This is a romance novel not a treatise on philosophy."
3,Not even close,"This book reminded me a little of Judith McNaught's Something Wonderful. I bought this book after reading the reviews here and thought I found an author who writes just like JM does. Unfortunately after reading the book, the author does not come close. The book was good but now JM or Julie Garwood worthy.I recommend checking this book out at the library."
3,Pretty Good,"This book is a nice romance that has a lot of inconsistencies; however, the writing is good and enjoyable, even though the characters' actions are a little implausible. My main complaint is that the plot, such as it is, really loses steam about three-fourths of the way through, so finishing this book is a bit tedious.Sharper editing and closer attention to historical detail would have made this a much better book. That said, it's a nice afternoon's diversion if you are willing to overlook its flaws."
3,Definitely a tear jerker - but not my style,"This is my first Julia London novel. I picked the book based on the reviewers comments. It is a well-written book full of tension and torment. Although I love both Alex and Lauren, I was so tensed over the over-bearning sense of duty and responsibility they each felt that I couldn't really enjoy the book. On one hand, the book kept me reading until I finished it in one sitting, but it really moved too slow for my taste. It has beautiful moments between the two of them, but lacked humor throughout. I agreed with one reviewer that it seemed to take the two such a long time to get together that It almost forced me to skip pages. I thought the supporting characters could have been a little funnier to balance off the desparate main plot. If you the sort of reader who enjoys lots of sexual tension, sad feeling of bad timing, a good cry... this would be a book for you."
2,Dull.........Have a lot of time...It doesn't move along,"Was I the only one who didn't like this book. I found it to be very dull. It didn't move very fast and I found it a challenge to keep reading it. I thought the stubborn pride of Alex and Lauren was a little over done and the story could have ended a long time before it did, if the two would really have listened to each other. Do youself a favor and don't read it, if you don't have a lot of time."
5,peakin,"before they became in league with the poodle heads - more akin to Can, Eno, and Cabaret Voltaire. - I Travel."
1,I have only one word for this . . .,"Unlistenable. I own the thing, just to have a complete collection, but I never play it, and no songs make my MP3 playlist. ""Life in a Day"" and ""Real to Real Cacaphony"" are bad in the sense of being beginning efforts, but this just hurts my ears. For committed ""Mind's"" fans only. Maybe committed in an institutional sense, because being exposed to this too long could drive you bonkers. Music for pergatory."
3,One For The Converted,"Inspired by the band's first major tour of continental Europe (opening for Peter Gabriel), Empires and Dance is strongly influenced by the driving, electronic Krautrock of groups like Harmonia. Anticipating poor sales, only a few thousand copies were initially pressed by Arista Records, probably because seven of the ten tracks show no attention to melody or standard pop-song structures. This gutsy release has more verve than anything Simple Minds recorded after 1982 and includes two of their finest songs: ""I travel"" and ""celebrate"", but-especially on side two-it mostly falls short of its potential. Get ""Reel to Real Cacophony"" (1979) or ""New Gold Dream"" (1982) instead."
5,This book has been my favorite of them all!,This book has been my favorite out of all of them. Everyone knows that Todd and Elizabeth belong together. they were destined to be together. Tom and Liz made a good couple but I still think Todd is more hansome then Tom is and Todd is more romantic. so I think this was a good book but she and todd were meant to be together
1,This book . . . is the worst!!!,"Ok, here's what I mean! Elizabeth and Tood do NOT belong together. In SVH I hated it that they were all lovey-dovey. Second, it starts happening again! Geez! Third, who wants a book written all about Liz and Todd? I wish this one wasn't written. The series would be MUCH better off with out it."
2,Faulty scale!,"After ordering my first one I found that it was defective after only 2 uses. Then I had the second one sent to me and it just seems to be a really poorly made or designed item. I have to move the scale around my house about 20 times before it stops reading ""error"" and lets me weigh myself, because it's very particular about the flooring. Even my hard word floor, a surface that for all intents and purposes looks completely FLAT to me, is too tricky for it I guess. I regreat buying this scale and wish I had purchased another brand. I give it 2 stars however because when it DOES weigh me, it's very accurate."
2,Not what I expected...,On the website it has a very modern look but when you have it in front on you it looks a bit tacky. The part where you put your feet on isn't metal. It is a dark speckled gray that looks like a cheap kitchen countertop and it doesn't have any good features. It doesn't show ounces and it is very plain. The only reason I kept it was because it was cheap and I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending back.
5,It Happened to Nancy,"It Happened to Nancy was a great book! I would recomend everyone to read this book. It has taught me a lot of information that I could use when I get older. I also liked this book, because it is from a teens point of view and I am a teen that could relate to her. She sounds like she has been through a lot of struggles and I understand what she was going through. I mean, the stuff that happened to Nancy, has never happened to me, but I can imagine what she was going through in her rough times. I think everyone should take time out and read this book."
5,"May 22, 2001 It happened to nacy.",A little girl who was won a blind date with a man. She asked him to come over.HE came alright and left her with a life treating disesses HIV! Would you like to invite him to your house someday.I don't think so.Author;unknown
4,THE IDEAS I GOT WERE INCRIDIBLE,THIS BOOK ACCTUALLY DID IT FOR ME. WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING AND ABSORBING ALL OF THE PICTURES. I WENT CRAZY MY MIND STARTED STORMING WITH IDEAS. MY PERSONAL BUSINESS WENT REAL GOOD I FEEL LIKE A MORE CONFIDENT INTERIOR DESIGNER DUE TO THIS BOOK.
3,"""Sounds of silence""","Stephen Mark Rainey has edited a very pleasant collection of stories for the Cthulhu enthusiast. While most are either familiar or non-memorable, one newer story is particularly eerie: ""In the Rue dAuseil"" by Fred Chappell has exactly the frisson and dark laughter that characterize HPL. The collector of automata focuses on musicians, and composes for them. In his searches he finds out what Erich Zann really was... Good reading for Hallowe'en!"
2,mediocre songs,"his didn't cut it. some of the stories were of the kind where the military are challenged by pulpish creatures. i hate those stories. there is a story by Smith here, not really good horror, but had suspence. in addition there is a good story by Rainey. but the rest, no. Some, like Piccirrilli, get almost interesting, but in the end, you wonder why you read them."
5,not sure why i'm reviewing!,"If you take a class requiring this text you absolutely need it, as it is much easier to take the pages out to do the work. Other than that not the most exciting textbook! Buy enjoy!"
3,Beware of speaker phone issues,This is a very nice phone with the exception (and this goes for a number of the ATT phones) that when you use speaker phone it clips parts of the speaker's words so you miss part of the conversation. According to ATT the only way to correct this is to hold down the mute button when the caller is speaking and relaease it when you are talking. This is not progress.
4,Great phone for home office or small business.,"I bought one of these for my home office a few months ago and liked it so much, I purchased three more for my business office. They work just fine. I especially like the separate headset jack button on the phone (no need to lift the handset). I use an inexpensive Panasonic KX-TCA60 headset (about $15) and it works perfectly. This phone is also available at Costco's website for $120 and can be returned for a full refund if you're not completely satisfied.I'd have given it five stars if it had a built-in answering machine."
2,Disappointing In All Respects,"Speaker quality: poor when it was working...mostly it didn't work at all.Line identification for incoming calls: this worked for a few days and then stopped working altogether...I got good at identifying the call by the ring and pushing the right button.Battery: it stopped working within a week and it didn't matter after that whether a new battery was installed or not.Run away from, don't walk away, from this phone. AT&T; should be ashamed of their poor product line."
2,Works ok....except for the speakerphone,"I bought five of these for small business use. We like to use speakerphones a lot. Since sound does not typically pick up well from even a couple feet away I plan on sending them back once I find an alternative. Sometimes it does pick up ok, although faintly for the person on the other end of the line. Other times, then report that my voice is not only faint, but also cutting in and out.The speaker itself does not put out sounds in very good quality. You will turn up the volume trying to hear better and it will become distorted, like a cell phone speakerphone. So not recommended if you plan on using the speakerphone a lot."
4,phone,"Already own 7 of these phones and needed another for an office. This phone is the perfect for a small office. We use the 3 line system: has hold, dial memory and call history. A good small system for the money."
2,Lots of Features With Poor Reliability,"Two issues I had were:1. When connecting to a Vonage line, Caller ID did not work until after I completely powered down the phone, including removing the backup batteries.2. The headset volume was always too loud even when the volume was set to the minimum setting. I had to hold the phone away from my ear.The phone is full featured and seemed ideal for my small business, but it's going to get replaced."
2,Speakerphone Problem on 4 of these,"I have four ATT 974's. All the speakerphones cut in and out, making it impossible to have a conversation. Anyone looking to sit on conference calls will be disappointed. Other features are pretty good, but the speakerphone problem trumps the rest. I do not recommend this product, but good luck finding a decent one, I've tried many others with no satisfaction."
4,Comments on hte phone,The phones are pretty good but I am having a little problem with a gate phone which I connected to one of the lines
4,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR HEAD,If you don't purchase this CD there is something cleary wrong here. It is a beautifully orchestated melodic and tranquil rocking good time. Listen to YOUR LOVE and you are immediately swept into a hook that sweeps you away. God these guys are bringing backy PUNCHING melodies. Also note MARY...one of the best songs on the cd...The background chorus will be in your head for days. Supergrass take off in places where other radio accessable acts wouldn't dare. They challenge to be different than other British acts. This album rocks and then sways...it's definately a MELLOW relaxing affair...recommended on hot days lying on grassy noles....
4,Not quite Super this time,"Sonically, these guys know how to make things work, no question about it. Every song here has interesting textures and solid production ideas. This time the problem is mainly with songwriting. Simply put, the tunes are not quite as well-crafted as on their last outing In It For The Money. The band seems to be relying more on the groves of the songs rather than melodies. That said, there are still some exceptional moments: Pumping On Your Stereo rocks, Mary has a nice, slightly creepy vibe and Moving is... well, very moving indeed. This deserves four stars because, despite the flaws, Supergrass can still convey a sense of fun in their music. I just think they are capable of creating a little more accomplished material."
3,Happy BritRock,"While Supergrass succeeds at getting people up off their rear ends and dancing, most of this album seems un-inspired. True, Supergrass plays with tons of energy, but that's the way they've always been. The songs ""Your Love"" and ""What Went Wrong (In Your Head)"" are the two best songs on this album. The popular song on MTV, ""Pumping on Your Stereo"", has great energy to it but can get irritably annoying if listened to more than once in a row. I like this album, but there aren't enough good songs on it to warrant more than a 3-star rating. Plainly average."
1,The Big Let Down,"I bought this album in the stores the day it was released, and a week later Supergrass was to play in DC. I was excited for the show and excited for the album. After listening to it about 5-6 times, my fiance and I bagged on going to the show and haven't listened to the album since. It really let me down. ""Moving"" is an EXCELLENT song, exactly what I expected from the album and fooled me into thinking the rest was gonna be great. ""Pumping on your stereo"" is semi-tolerable, ""Jesus came from outerspace"" kinda sounds like something from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and everything else is just a let down! They have officially LOST their edge. Give me ""I SHOULD COCO"" and ""IN IT FOR THE MONEY"" any day, but leave this one alone."
1,Dopey Grass,"This is a horrible CD. Money poured down the drain. I can't make up my mind what it is I hate the most about their CD:the music? the lyrics? everything? It's really unnerving, seriously. You can't relax to it, sing along, or anything else. It was making me really jittery, I had to turn it off."
4,British invasion continues,"What Oasis owes The Beatles, these guys owe the Rolling Stones. Their sound is very '70s, very guitar-driven, very accessable.""Moving"" and ""What Went Wrong (in Your Head)"" have a disco beat that screams for leather knee-high boots, gold chains and nylon. ""Beautiful People"" takes the same beat and lays harder guitar over it without making the sound too heavy.The Rolling Stones are present in spirit in nearly every song, though the lead singer doesn't so much sound like Mick as feel like him.The laid-back ""Mary"" makes you wonder why the mellotron ever went away.A nice counter-balance in your CD changer for Travis, the other Brit pop band of the moment. Where Travis tends to the mellow, Supergrass begs to be turned up loud."
4,If you don't buy this - you should be shot,This album is incredible. Moving is an amazing song - Pumping on your stereo is a classic and Faraway is song of the century. I think capital punishment should be introduced to all who don't buy this album.
4,Quite a surprise,"Please, don't take this review wrong. I give the album 4 stars because it is great music and it's better than just about anything out right now. However, I was disappointed when I first heard the album. ""I Should Coco"" and ""In It For the Money"" are two of my favorite albums ever, and when I heard the first single ""Pumping On Your Stereo"" I was expecting a somewhat similar album to the other two. However, ""Supergrass"" is a drastic change from the past. They really have grown up apparently. The punk rock influences on the first two albums are virtually gone on this album. Despite the disappointment, the album is still excellent and grows on me with every listen. I really like the songs ""Eon,"" ""Faraway"" and ""Pumping On Your Stereo."" Overall, I would recommend this album to Supergrass fans and all British pop fans in general. It is a good album and it is definitly worth buying."
3,A little tired effort from a great band. Still has lots of good songs.,"The first two supergrass albums where such amazing efforts it would be understandable that an album that would be considered outstanding by any other band is just ""good"" for supergrass. They sound a little tired on this to me. Not as inspired to create a unique musical experience. Although it is insane to see them as the second best band behind the beatles. After the Fab their music is next in line for me. Maybe that's why this effort disapoints a bit."
4,The Best of 2000,"Give these guys some credit: In a year where both ""Greatest Bands in the World"" U2 and Radiohead released albums, Supergrass came out with an album that blew away both of them. The formula is relatively simple: Great, inticate songwriting, mixing enjoyable hooks with a variety of instrumentations. While this record is derivative (""Pumping on your Stereo"" is very Rolling Stones-ish, as are most of the better songs on the album) and perhaps lacks some of the punch and distortion of their previous release ""In it for the Money,"" this is an album you can listen to from start to finish and enjoy every minute. It's unfortunate that this band hasn't really caught on as much in the US (although ""Pumping"" sounded great in the movie ""Road Trip""), but any rock fan who checks this record out will certainly find it a rewarding listen."
4,A worthy effort.,"All things considered, this is a great recording for the money, if you like John Rutter. His music on this disc is, as always, quite beautiful; just don't expect it to be particularly deep, as is also often the case with Rutter. So the guy's not Mozart, Faure, or even Cherubini, but so what - who is? This is a fine recording, beautifully sung, and (considering the price) it gets a strong recommendation from me. That said, my only real gripe is the singing of soprano Caroline Ashton. While her voice is pretty and she conveys the spirit of the music well, she sounds like a boy soprano, and her phrasing and breath control could have been better. These are small gripes, however, and no reason not to buy this fine disc."
1,Nice easy listening,"For people who are looking for nice easy listening, this is a CD that can be added to their collection. However, for those looking for a serious musical exploration of the themes of life and death, Rutter's Requiem falls far short of the standard set by previous composers. For the most part the music is too saccharine, inundated with cliches that remind the listener of Hollywood movie soundtracks. The Sanctus even sounds somewhat like Christmas music.In terms of the performance, the orchestra and choir do a very good job, and I applaud the choice of soloists -- very effective singing."
5,John Rutter at his best,"I love this album. After singing 'Requiem' several years ago, it brought it all back to me. Amazing soloists, superb sound, the next best thing to hearing it live (or performing it myself). A must have for any John Rutter fan, or choral singer."
3,"Competent, pleasant, but unaffecting","Sounds a lot like Enya, believe it or not; very well performed, euphonious, but bland."
5,STAY HOME & PRACTICE,I used the cd to practice John Rutter's Magnificat. I sang along throughout the piece with a tenor and soprano. I sang the alto part. It was very helpful to have a high quality recording dto work with.
4,great book,this book is great for sociology and the theories that are in the sociological world. definitely a great book for class or for someone who is interested in sociology
4,Sociology,The book came in the right condition and as fast as possiable. It was snow on the ground here and it slowed the process down but that wasn't on the sender it was on Arkansas mailing service.
2,OK,"Not sure how I ordered this book. I remember looking up the info on this book but not ordering it. It didn't cost but a few dollars, but it was useless to my daughter. It didn't include what was to be InfoTrac."
4,"good fan, nice design","very powerfull, nice designdisliked: could use an arrow to show airflow direction (at least i did not find it)"
5,Masterpiece,"The amazing thing about Akira Yamaoka's music is that it actually has the ability to take you to Silent Hill. Anyone that has ever listened to this music seperate from the games knows that. Turn off your lights and let this beautiful CD bring you back to ""That special place""; Silent Hill.Moving on to actual content.The music on this CD ranges from dark piano ballads to ambience that sounds like rumbling machinery and metal pangs and creaks. Every once in a while you even get a bouncy rock/pop song but even those are very ""Silent Hill"".I don't think this is for the casual fan but I suppose even they could find at least something enjoyable here. For you die-hard fans, though, I strongly recommend this CD."
5,"A work of art, 'silent hill' style; deep, beautiful, and eerie","Anyone who has played the SH series know that this is the best soundtrack to date. In fact, all of the soundtracks are great, but this one and SH 4 are the best in my opinion. The orignial SH soundtrack is fantastic, but more ambiant and more for die hard fans. SH 3 has the weekest score in the series, and in my opinon, is very different than the rest. Many people say the SH 4 ( the game, not the score) is the weakest in the series, and I completely disagree. I thought sh4 was strong and 3 was the weakest, though it was still very good ( though I LOVE the whoe evil other world, culty side to SH, I thought it was better played up in 4 and 1; SH 2 is just amazing, though there isn't too much culty stuff)All in all, this is my favorite game series, with the best soundtracks to date. Buy this soundtrack and 4, as they r the best!"
4,Pretty good,"I love totally spies the show and Sam is my favorite. It's a good doll, but I think $70.00 is too much to spend on a doll."
4,Give The Drummer All,"Not an album in the strict sense, Graveyard & The Ballroom puts live tracks in with studio recordings. I guess the band (or its label) were primarily interested in getting something out quickly. While the songs are kind of simplistic/monotonous and vocals shoddy, there's no denying that great, funky drummer (Donald Johnson). He really makes these songs come alive. Bassist Jeremy Kerr added enough punch to keep it interesting.It reminds meet of Davis Bowie meets James Brown meets Joy Division. An interesting sound.[DW]"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I was very intrigued by the almost Cyberpunk plot of the novel, done by a female author. Certain aspects of the plot were done quite well, and I would call them quite fresh, however the climax was not up to par, nor was I impressed with how the story unfolded toward the end. An interesting and quite short read, but not on my top 10 list."
2,Did Not Dig It,"This book was well-written enough that I didn't trip over my eyeballs or anything, but frankly I didn't see the point. Slumming rich gal works at a sewage plant, spots safety violations, and sleeps with her boss. This is entertainment? This is science fiction? Slow year for the Nebulas, I guess."
1,be warned,"i was very disappointed in the book, and amazed that it won a nebula. the science fiction aspects are minimal and mainly related to near-future waste management methods. the narrative borrows split-time techniques developed and far better utilized by many others. the story line is obsessed with graphic lesbian encounters. perhaps i was spoiled by having read 3 phillip k dick classics and gene wolfe's masterpiece ""the fifth head of cereberus"" before this, but this seems like a minor work of limited interest and a short shelf-life. spend your money and time elsewhere. be alerted: several aspects of the book are frankly explicit."
4,Good cyberpunk is hard to find,"In a genre over-run with cliches and wannabes, this is a standout. Nothing here rang harsh against reality, or seemed unfeasable - in fact, its feasability was almost frightening. Griffith is definitly a peer of Stephenson and Gibson and I look forward to looking for her other works."
2,Not very good,"A fan of good writing should avoid this like the plague. The analogies used are some of the worst I have ever read, and the descriptions are often bizarre, misplaced and poorly planned, with the images invoked bearing little power or relevance. Examples include a river so black it is purple and images that open her mind ""like a can opener,"" calling up a truly mundane kitchen utensil. Comparing the character's mind to that of a crocadile leaves me nothing but confused. A good example of bad writing."
3,Dark and Moody,"This novel moved a little slower than the sort I usually like, but the prose is engaging, with interesting characters, and kept me reading to the end. It is a dark and moody character piece however, and those looking for a high action sci-fi action novel should look elsewhere. Those looking to learn some of the biochemical nuances of sewage processing should sign right up (really, it's interesting). Whoda thunk that could be the center technology of a sci-fi novel!"
5,The rich and the poor,"Slow River is a masterful exploration of the difference between the rich and the poor. The language is beautiful, the scenery is immersive, tangible and fragrant, and the characters are painted fully into life. I must compliment the author on her language skill, a quality so very rare in modern literature. Although there are quite a few lesbians in the novel, this is mostly irrelevant to the storyline, despite what other reviewers seem to think. The novel is not about sex, it's about character and self-discovery. It's about the contrast between patrician Lore and the poor people around her, like Spanner and Magyar; the contrast between their character and view of life, between their occupations and their goals, and between their moral codes. It's about why and how the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, and why Lore couldn't stay in the gutter where she was cast, while Spanner couldn't leave it. If you like books that make you think, you should like this one."
3,Heavily Used Copy,"While the book is complete, it arrived in a very worn condition. I hope it is able to stand upright for typing. Other than that, it is a very good book and will definitely be helpful in teaching my son to type."
5,Classic beauty!,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The color of the stones is dark violet and has a great sparkle to it. Pretty long, too, more than an 1 inch in length. And you can't go wrong with free shipping!"
4,Excellent kit for replacement,"I was skeptical of the performance in my 20 plus year old oxygen sensor, and was hesitant to pay from $160-200 for a facotry fit replacement when a universal was available for $50. The Bosch universal kit was a snap to install ,and came with very detailed instructions. The new sensor adjusts voltage levels quickly when testing in my car with varying fuel mixtures."
4,Very interesting book.,This book is a wonderful read and a great reminder of how far we have come thanks to people like Jacques Cousteau.
2,nudnick,"VERY MEDIOCRE AND TOO SENTIMENTAL. HE DOES NOT ASK THE HARD QUESTION: WHY DID JEWS EVOLVE FROM SOCIALISM AS A KIND OF RELIGION TO NEOCONS. HE FAILS TO DIFFERENTIATE YIDDISH SOCIALISTS, WHO WERE NOT BRIGHT PEOPLE, FROM REAL YIDDISH INTELLECTUALS WHO HAD THEIR OWN WORLD, WERE QUITE URBANE AND KNEW ABOUT OTHER CURRENTS OF THOUGHT, AND A MUCH KEENER KNOWLEDGE OF YIDDISH.COMPARED TO YURI SLEZKINE'S SUPERB ""THE JEWISH CENTURY,"" THIS IS QUITE UNIMPRESSIVE."
2,"Shallow ,sophomoric writing about an important subject","Syrota's slim volume is a first person account of his stay in Burma, including his brushes with immigration and internal security. The book has been well-reviewed in the travel press, but unfortunately, doesn't really add much to the information that one can get from one of the more politically aware guidebooks. There isn't much cultural or historical detail and we often get little depth from his experiences. Mostly, it reads like a paraphrasing of a traveler's journal. Some travelers are marvellous storytellers, but many are not. The tone is whiny in places and the author's unhappiness at having his itinerary curtailed gets in the way of the Burmese own stories.The book is a helpful reminder that even important stories can be poorly told."
3,"OMIT THE ""NAME GAME"" AND YOU HAVE A GOOD CD","I have detested the ""Name Game"" since I was a very little child. It is idiotic, irritating and has nothing in the world to recommend it. To this day, I can remember fleeing the sound of that stupid stinky junk. In adulthood, I find I hate it just as much as I did then and have never been able to listen to that stupid thing without it being an excercise in torture. It is one very atrocious piece.The other tunes on this collection are quite good and will bring many a smile to many a face. I would have given this a higher rating, but the ""Name Game"" cost this 2 stars."
2,Very good story but dreadful format,This was a great story and I loved it BUT as has already been mentioned in these reviews it's almost impossible to read in screenplay format and that really put me off. I hope Mr King doesn't continue in this vein because I won't buy any more books like this no matter how good the story.
4,Great writing with a bad Plot.,"I really liked the book up until I realized what he wanted. I don't think anyone should use childern in this way, for any reason. He should have reunited father and son at the end."
2,"Suspenseful at first, then annoying.","Does advertising sell? Yes, it does. I'll admit, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. (Stephen King books and I are old friends.) But what started off as legendary Stephen King suspense turned to annoyance with Linoge's repetitive, ""Give me what I want and I'll go away."" Ooh, spooky scary. It would've been OK, if Linoge said it that first time, and it also would've been all right if King left it alone with the first 3 murders, but no, it had to go on and on and on. ""Give me what I want and I'll go away."" Even after the constable asked him what he wanted, Linoge chose silence. Well, he had his chance. I couldn't even finish Storm of the Century. Instead, I made up an ending in my head, that I probably would like better than the originally ending anyways."
5,Don't Damn the Author,"After reading the reviews of ""Storm of the Century"", I have just a few comments to make. First, for those that praised the book, thank you; I agree one hundred percent. For those who gave negative reviews based on the formatting of the text, remember this: everything comes in different packages. If the world consisted of constants, without deviating from the norm, wouldn't it be a really boring place to live. Accept the change, for this particular novel, or next time read the small print (perhaps you would have seen the disclaimer about the manuscript style format). Don't judge the book by the way the material was delivered but by the content within the delivery. My recommendation to you, negative reviewers, is to put the book down and watch the mini-series. Perhaps reading the manuscript style format is too taxing on your narrow minds."
4,THANKS TO THE KING FAN!!!!!,"First, I did enjoy the Storm, but it would be cooler if it were a novel. The movie was pretty good also. I would like thank the KING FAN that recommended, ""THE FIST OF GOD' by A.T. Nicholas. It was great! The plot was phenomenal and the writing style was awesome. Can't wait for the next one."
3,"Good start, somewhat disappointing ending.","I read the book description before I bought the book so I knew it was a screenplay. The format didn't bother me. It was hard to put down once I started. The setting, with the storm and the isolation of the island contributes to the fear factor of the story almost as much as the villain. I was disappointed in the ending, not that it wasn't believable it just wasn't the ending I would have preferred."
1,Disapointed at little tall,One of the worst most complicating movies that I have ever witnessed. All the big hype leading up to the third night was very disapointing. The ending made no sense what so ever. He just took a kid and never returned what is with the constable seeing his son at the end? This movie disapointed many fans and could of been played in one sitting.
5,Teenage Opinon,"Stephen King has made another novel full of horror and suspense. The biggest storm ever is about to hit a town called Little Tall Island in Maine. While this storm is occuring a strange gentleman named Andre Linoge stops to visit. He walks up to a home owned by an old woman Martha Clarendon. Linoge charges in the old womans home and brutily murders her. Later, he purposly lets the police department arrest him."
5,hello...,"please if you have the book:""storm of the century""in brazilian portuguese, please informe me.thanks Lior my email: ligasimi@hotmail.com"
5,A great scary movie. Stephen King has a great mind.,This movie was really scary.For once the bad-guy won finaly something different.It had a great plot.If you like scary books you will love this one.
2,Weird,"Ok! I liked the book, but the way it is written...please. I understand that it is a screenplay...but they should have put something online warning us that it was written that way. I hope that this doesn't become a habit."
4,"Solid effort, albeit in different form, from King","King is perhaps one of the few writers who has the foresight and fruition to create a screenplay strictly for film purposes and still maintain his integrity to his readers and audience. Reading Storm of the Century may prove a tad different at first but the sheer excitement and pace with which the story develops makes it a worthwhile read. In particular, his incorporation of the pure, unadulterated surroundings against the sinister forces that lurk in the world give the screenplay its backbone. I believe that the mini-series actually did the screenplay justice, considering it was filmed strictly for network television. The only thing that may confuse the reader is the number of characters and their relationship with each other."
2,"Oh, boy...He goofed","Let me start out by saying that I have every book ever written by Stephen King... I love the guy! His work is consistently tense, and scary! Except for this one. I don't know what happened, but Stevie goofed. This story disgusted me. The reason is say this is because he let the bad guy win! This would not be a problem, except for the reason the bad guy won. Those of you who have seen it know what I mean. I can think of a hundred more evil, and more likely ways to end this tale. This is not the best way this story could have ended. However, I DO have to give him snaps for thinking up a terrifying story basis... He has NEVER failed at that. Over all... I'd like to say that this in not a film or movie that I would ever want to experience again. I feel aweful for saying so, but it's the truth."
1,What a major disappointment!,Warning! This is the screenplay of 'Storm of the Century' and reads like a play! If you're looking for a novel - don't order it! I was looking forward to another S. King 'sit and read right through' novel. NOT a screenplay. I guess I missed the fine print
3,Not Great,"I like most all Stephen King works, but The Storm of the Century lacked the classic King suspense and horror of all his other books."
4,Didn't see the movie - Loved the book.,"Even though I did not have a chance to see this movie, I did read the book. And I enjoyed it. It was classic S.K. I find it hard to believe that some people didn't like it just because it reads as a screenplay. Okay, so maybe at first, it was slow reading, but heaven forbid, you should have to think about anything. Or, I don't know, maybe draw some conclusions for yourself. I just think that anyone who didn't like it JUST because it was a screenplay - is lazy and should quit complaining."
4,Didn't like that the book was the screen play.,The only thing i didn't like was that the book was the screen play. It was kinda hard for me to understand. I watched the mini-series first and then went back and read the book. I felt it was a lot easier that way instead of trying to keep all the characters seperated in your head.
5,Great movie...great book!!,"im an avid reader of King and the made for tv movie for this book was very well done, i then read the screenplay for a deeper insight of the characters and for things I've overlooked the first time around and was not let down. The book draws you in from the first chapter with intricate detail of a town I haven't seen since It, therefore it is easy to feel like a regular townsperson from Kings descriptive writing. An involving book from cover to cover."
3,"Another ""The kids know"" story","I had my hopes set high when I bought this book, because the Kings Gunslinger/Avant Garde/Dragonslayer period was getting horribly boring. The first 20 pages was a pain to read because of the screenplay layout, but after a while I got used to the awkward format. The plot of the story is as old as the hills, but the main character is described in such a magnificent way, that he almost jumps from the pages. I am of course talking about Linoge, who is in my opinion the hero of this story. Read the book - not because you want a good thrill, but mainly because you want to meet Mr. Linoge."
1,Clive Barker is Better,"I've read many of Mr. King's books and I believe the reason they are so long is because he spends a great deal of time talking about trivial things such as the color of eyes, shape of eyes, length of hair, color of pants, etc. In this book Croatan is mentioned at least twice (and in the movie), but neither explains what a Croatan is! It's a werewolf! If you want true horror and excitement, try Clive Barker and I would suggest your first experience with Mr. Barker be ""The Damnation Game"". It's FANTASTIC!"
1,Where's the beef!,"Too many unanswered questions: who is the bad guy? why did he choose that island? why did he kill people? why did he have others kill themselves? where did he come from? he has immense powers - why didn't he just take one of the kids? why did he have to call the town meeting to ""ask"" for one of the kids?In other words, King put absolutely no thought into writing anything plausible - he was merely out for the shock value. All of you bozos that think he's the best writer since time began should question the faults in this piece of crap (and his other works) a bit more closely."
2,The Lottery?,"An easy read and it's good to see King not copping out on the ending but if you read Jackson's story you saw how this was turning out around the first time you read, ""Give me what I want and I'll go away."""
5,One great story,"Since I am from the town where the movie was filmed, I obviously had extra interest in the Storm of the Century. I was surprised, however, how good the movie and the screenplay actually were. After seeing the movie, I bought the book and could not put it down, even though I knew what was going to happen. It really grabs you, while you feel for the townspeople and decision they have to make. The ending is disturbing, which I suppose it what Stephen King is trying to accomplish. Overall, I would say this is a great tale, no matter what medium you experience it in."
5,Stephen King's best,This is no simple horror. Beneath its scary moments and thrills Storm of the Century is a tale about parenthood and how we need as a community to be together to survive. I saw the miniseries and i was surprised by the realism the story had. Andre Linoge is everything that threatens our security and well-being and that put us in moral dilemmas that either destroy us or make us better human beings. For me the moral of the story is that evil can be learned and it walks in our streets just by our side.
4,What an amazing storm!,"The Storm of the Century is an excinting book from the Master of Horror, the story involve the reader on the 3 parts of the book. It is amazing the character of Andre Linoge and what can he don with those misterious and dark powers. I like a lot the book, maybe the end wasn't what I expect but I recommend this book because Il is logic the reaction of the people of an island it this story really happen some day, I can't wait to buy the video. The storm of the century is coming to Little Tall Island, but that is not the only thing that is coming, there is a man that want something from the people of Little Tall Island."
1,What was that all about?,"Predictible (and how so), incoherent, and just soooo boring.... Huge disappointment. Why was the miniseries so long? Did he get paid per minute? Per page? Where is the King of Shining, Firestarter, Carrie? Goodbye Stephen, the king is dead."
3,The book is written like a script and is hard to follow.,"I am a huge fan of Stephen King and love just about everything He writes but this is very difficult to follow. It is written in a script format which makes it difficult to really visulize the situation which for me has always been half the story with anything he writes. After I see the movie, perhaps it will be a better read. I know I will give it a second chance,"
2,Excellent Production Nearly Redeems Dull Mystery,"But not quite. While I wouldn't say this was a terrible novel, I also wouldn't say that it was in any way memorable. Because of the wonderful dramatization on the audio cassette, I passed an afternoon at work more pleasantly, being entertained by the acting skills of the readers. However, if I'd been merely reading a text version of this story, I wouldn't have finished it because the plot did not interest me enough to deserve my full attention. The characters are too typical of a mystery novel, the prose style unremarkable, and the ending not too exciting."
2,rather weak,"Normally I love these winners of the Richard Wilbur Award, but I found Krisak's book to be rather weak. Disappointing because Rhina Espaillat and her Powwow River Poets are usually quite good, but Krisak's poems left something to be desired. They didn't sizzle or pop, and quite frankly, I didn't find the technique all that great either (I think he needs to take a long look at his line breaks). Still, there is promise with this poet, especially with a mentor like Rhina Espaillat."
1,Broken within a month,Avoid this product. The handle broke within a month of use which is exactly outside of the time window Amazon allows the item to be returned when you added the delivery time from the order date. Save your money and I would avoid buying cooking products from this site.
5,Joyce Chen Wok,Purchased this wok as a gift since I have one and love it. I'm sure the recipient will also love it.
5,great wok,"I love this wok. Great size, heats very well. I use it for my stir-fry's & even my large italian sauces! I definitely recommend this product."
4,west coast punk that'll make you scream for more!,"twotimer is an awesome band. i've seen them in concert twice and this cd has been long awaited. this is music that rivels the likes of MxPx, Slick Shoes, Green Day, and Blink 182. if you like punk or punk influenced alternative, this is a must-have!"
2,Good but not organized,"First off, this band definately has potential. They could be really good, but their music was jumbled and garbaled. It seemed they wrote these songs quickly. The choruses aren't catchy like Mxpx or Slick Shoes. Personally I hate the singers voice but that's me I guess. It just seemed to me like more time needed to be put into this album."
4,Not bad for such a light headphone,"This headphone, though very light, produces crystal clear sound and respectable bass. It's quite amazing considering the size and the weight. It doesn't disconnect you from the rest of the world (when you don't want to be) by closing off your ear, and its sound quality is orders of magnitute better than those throw-away ear-buds. It's very comfortible, too, just make sure you don't wear it backwards.I use it with an Archos Jukebox Recorder and they are a perfect match. Highly recommended for the price."
3,"Durable, Decent Sound","Have it for 8 months. Ultra durable, flexible, sounds good. HAve run with it in the rain, sweat resistant (wont stop playing due to ear sweat).However the sound is very weak, and does not sound good with my ipod... Sounds good with my high power PC audio but not withportable devices.. But its ultra durable and good looking"
3,There's better for the money,"These are light and somewhat comfortable. As other reviewers have said they have VERY little bass. Lots of highs though, almost tinny sounding. If they performed better on the lows I'd rate them higher."
1,they're yellow for a reason...weak,"I'm a disc jockey so I think I know what I'm talking about when I say: Please pass on these horrid-sounding headphones. Had to get some good 'phones for my ipod and my workouts but definitely got the wrong ones with these. Oh how the mighty Sony has fallen. Absolutely no bass, even after I cranked it up on the player. Just a treble filled session at the gym. Needless to say, couldn't get the blood pumping with only highs in the headphones. Just got the Sennheiser MX500's and am very impressed with the audio, just wish they had a headband 'cause the earbud style keeps slipping out after some sweat. Back to the MDR-W20G's. They [stink]. Don't buy anything from Sony that's under [a certain prices] because they just don't seem to care about the quality and, subsequently, making money."
4,bonecrusher=kikarserock,this is a great album..it fast furious punk rock and every punk rock lover should have this in their collection. I am honestly hooked on this cd and i think eveyrone should own a coupla copies of this!
4,bonecrusher=kikarserock,what a great cd! there is not a bad moment on the entire album.. all it is fast and furious punk rock. If i were you i would definetly pick up a couple copies of this. It should be in any punk lovers collection!
5,"Purchased for my father, a retired Seabee chief","My father thought this book was very good. He finished it rather quickly. Of course, for an old Seabee, he knew a lot of his history. He spent 20 years in the service, from the early 70s into the early 90s."
4,A cross-cultural comparison of social movements,This text is relevant for those wanting a gendered analysis of social movements with a solid cross-cultural analysis. It is also suitable for scholars and activists interested in Africa and the African diaspora.
4,The Funky Way to Start,"This is my #1 pick for starting a party, and getting people to dance to the music. It's the groovy way to get down. Most of the songs are upbeat, with an exciting rythem, just for dance. People in the party won't be shy to dance, they'll just dance. Perfect any time! :-)"
1,Overrated,"As a praciticing process engineer my opinion is this book lacks insight. Typical text book written a professor in the academic community with no practical experience. This book spends far to much time deriving equations and not discussing the basics concepts. The author makes a half hearted attempt to relate the first 14 chapters to the real worl, in a short and inadequate Chapter 15. This is the first mail book order book i took the time to return. In all honesty this book is not worth the $90.00. Spend your money elsewhere"
1,Not worth your time,"... It's terrible. The photos show lots of incorrectly restored junk from overseas, and the text is simply atrocious. The author obviously knows nothing about the subject because this book is factually inaccurate in many respects. The only redeeming quality I can find in this book are a few nice factory photos - but you can find those in other, higher quality books. Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,Worthless,"I have been a Thunderbird owner for 30 years. This book is by far the worst, poorly written and technically uncorrect piece of junk I have ever seen on the Early Birds"
1,"Awful Product,Don't Waste Your Money","This is a horrible product. Just like many others,this shampoo and conditioner were both IMPOSSIBLEto rinse out and left behind soooo much residue.I had to re-rinse my hair about 3 times after I had originallywashed it. It also made my hair smell an look super greasy. Neverpurchasing this again."
1,Warning: formula updated - yuck!,I was hooked on this product for months. But as more and more people discovered what I had discovered it became harder to find. Then for a month I couldn't find it anywhere. I figured Neutrogena was excited about their new star product and were either going to dilute it (to cash in on it's popularity) or raise the price. When it finally ended up on the shelves again I bought it and unfortunately it is no longer the same product. I am shipping my 5 bottles back to the Neutrogena corporate office. Very disappointed. It WAS the best conditioner I had ever used :(
5,Best conditioner for dry brittle hair,"Ok, I have very dry curly hair. It is very thick and hard to tame. I have tried almost every salon conditioner made for dry damaged hair. Some have worked ok but after awhile they all stop working. I decided to buy this based on the incredible reviews I read online. I have now been using it for over a year and it is by far my favorite hair product of all time. It makes my hair very soft yet never heavy. My curls are neat and healthy-looking instead of greasy or brittle. Best of all it continues to work after all this time. I am a happy camper. I even brought a bottle to my hairdresser because she didn't believe that a drugstore conditioner could work so well on my hair. definitely try this...you have little to lose and a lot to gain."
5,Still wear my hair long,I was thinking of maybe cutting my very dry hair. I use the product everyday and now I see a healthy and more manageable hair.
4,Talk about quick! (results that is),"I bought this and the weekly conditioner today,and it states on the bottle it can be used on dry hair, as well as damp hair. I put on a dime-sized dollop( I have a pixie cut),and Wow! My hair feels so much softer already.I may have put a touch too much on,but still,I am amazed at the results after one try.I will put smaller amounts in from here on out,as this seems to pack a punch.Hair that is color-treated,and ""winter-ized"" year after year sure does show.It looks lifeless...no lustre.This hopefully will ""cure"" my worn-out locks. I am very optimistic, and will try, and review the weekly mask asap."
5,Can't live without it,"I have used this product for a few years and can't find anything thing else economical and reliable. I have naturally curly, thick hair and this product is light on my hair. It does not width my hair down, nor does it leave a sticky, crunchy feel to my hair. The 3 pack is economical, since this product rarely goes on sale."
1,Don't buy it!,"Don't buy this. It made my hair feel dry and brittle. It smells good, has nice packaging, but I was disappointed in how poorly it left my hair feeling. There are plenty of other drug store brands for equal or lesser cost that will give much better results."
2,Did not work for me,"My hair is long and I die it blond, so it tends to be somewhat dry. This product did not work for me. My hair is easy to comb after I apply it but it looks rather dull, no miracle...."
1,Can't rinse out.,Impossible to rinse out completely; leaves residue that causes breakouts on my sensitive scalp. I originally bought it because the tube is convenient for travel but I guess otherwise not for me.
4,NICE Smell,Feels good and smells good I have only used it one time but my hair hasnt been as frizzy so thats great I like this product and am glad I bought it.
4,Not bad.,"This conditioner is very thick and creamy. It smells good too. I am African American, and I use it before (under my swim cap) and after swimming. It keeps my hair soft and shiny. It's also a good co-shampoo."
1,Won't repurchase,"It didn't do a thing for my relaxed hair. I deep condition with it under my hooded dryer, and it felt like I didn't use anything. My hair was tangled and hard"
2,I did not care for this product,I bought this leave in cream thinking it would help my hair stay soft and smooth. I am biracial (black and white mix) so my hair is extremely curly and thick. I was very disappointed with this cream because it made my hair somewhat crunchy and felt oily. If I had of known this I would not have bought it. Not to mention the smell is not pleasant either. It may work for some people but I was not pleased and will not buy again.
2,Worked well in the beginning...,"I used this shampoo right after using the EverSleek Loreal shampoo/conditioner. It was causing build up and made my scalp itchy/flaky and my hair heavy/greasy after a few months of using it. As soon as I used this Neutrogena shampoo, my hair was clean, itchy/flaky scalp gone. After a couple of months, however, the same thing started to happen with this shampoo/conditioner."
5,"Amazing on permed, colored hair","Best hair mask yet! I'm an Asian with naturally thin, super straight hair. After years of both coloring and perming, my hair is now extremely dry, tangled and brittle with nasty split ends. Every time I use this, immediately that day I get compliments on my hair and how soft and beautiful it looks, but if I don't use it, let's just say my hair doesn't look healthy. I'm tempted to start using this mask every day except that I'm concerned it would weigh my hair down too much!"
