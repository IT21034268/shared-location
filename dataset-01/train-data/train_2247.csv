1,Only for light-duty use,"If you have a very light-duty trimming project, I'm sure this product will do fine. But I have a 10' laurel privacy hedge and it just wasn't up to the task."
2,"For serious hedge, keep looking","Paid someone to trim tall hedges last two years. Bought this product for do it yourself. Saw user height concerns, decided would just get any higher from ladder. Heavy product, but doable. Fell. Between, ER visit, XRays, 2 doctor visits, scan, I could have paid professional landscaper to trim them the rest of my life. Pretty fit, but now also very negative impact on exercising, more. Not B&D's fault ... device works as advertised ... Angles, cuts etc. But for ANY hedge 9 or 10 feet or more, I would strongly advise ... Keep looking. Need a product design that is lighter, telescopes much higher. Just not a good design solution for tall hedges. Also, my wife said too heavy for her to use conveniently for light yard trimming."
2,battery for hedge trimmer,"Battery for B&K; cordless electric pole hedge trimmer adds considerable weight to the trimmer.Also it has a short running time. Altogether I would prefer an electric trimmer without the added weight, and with unlimited cutting time. Note that the battery is discharging whether it's in use or not. If the hedge trimmer is set aside for lunch, I suspect the battery would run down. The only time the battery is not discharging is when it's plugged in the charger unit.The same comments apply to the B&K; lawn trimmer. The battery runs down quickly. In order to do a full trimming and edging job, I must run the equipment nonstop without doing any other lawn workduring the mowing-edging-trimming process.Amazon Verified Purchase"
2,A Lot Shorter than Advertised!,"After dropping $250 a year into having a landscaper trim my hemlocks (12 feet high-which is the only thing he does, I do all the rest anyway) I thought it made sense to buy my own hedge trimmer that was capable of long reaches. I spotted this unit for $129.00 in Lowes last year, but this year they don't have it. It turns out on Amazon it is cheaper anyway. My disspointment is the overall length. It is clearly marked on the box that the unit is 10 ft end to end, when in reality it is only about 6'5"". I fiddled with it for 20 minutes figuring it must extend. I called B&D; customer service and the nice girl on the phone explained ""they didn't do a good job of describing the machine, it's 10 feet when you extend your arms"". I gotta tell you - I'm 6'6"" and even so there's no way my arms extend 3.5 feet.I think based on the reviews this machine will still work OK - but buyer beware - it doesn't have the reach that is clearly labeled on the box."
4,B&D Cordless 18V Pole Hedge Trimmer,"One handy tool for the wide hedge. I was able to trim up to 8 feet across the top of a 6 foot privacy hedge. It,s lightweight, unlike a gas trimmer, and the absense of a cord make this a perfect tool for my situation. Branches up to a half inch were easily handled. The only drawback is 1/2 hour cutting time per battery with a 12 hour recharge time. Fortunatly, I also have 3 other B&D garden tools which use the same battery & the 2 hours total cutting time was just enough to finish the job."
4,pleased user of the cordless hedge trimmer,"The unit works as expected and is quite satisfactory. It is heavier than I anticipated and it will not reach as far, perhaps because I'm short of stature. statements should be based on a stated average heigth of 5""10"" or some such clarifying statement. I'm a satisfied customer."
4,B+D Cordless Pole Trimmer,After a short learning curve this trimmer made short work of my tall bushes. The only negative I experienced was the weight and balance when trimming at the maximum reach. Heavy use of this item will give a great upper-body workout.Black & Decker NPT318 18-Volt Cordless Electric Pole Hedge Trimmer
4,would recommend,Works well for hard to reach hedges. I little heavier then expected but has been a good tool.
4,Just what I needed.,"I have a very steeply banked ditch in the front of my property. I couldn't get a mower or a weedeater to get in to cut the weeds down. I was thinking if someone would put a hedge trimmer on a shaft it would work perfectly. Along comes Black & Decker with their NPT318, the very tool I needed. It works great. For being battery powered it really mows down the weeds. The head angles to match the slope of the ditch. The only feature I would have included is a strap. It is heavier than a regular weed eater."
4,B&D electric hedge pole trimmer,"I bought this trimmer as I could not reach the top of my hedges with a normal trimmer. It works very well, although it is heavy to hold. I'm 74 yearsold and may be this would not bother a younger person. Having it battery powered helps a lot."
2,Badly Designed,"This is ONLY for those shrubs that are up high and you would normally need a latter for, not normal height shrubs. I agree with the other reviewer that they need to make it so you can take the pole off or that tge main handle can telescope. Trying to use this on a normal shrub at knee level is ridiculious. It is too heavy and bulky to swing around for normal hedges. I took this back and got the 22' 18V and I love it."
3,Convenient But Not Heavy Duty,"My B&D NPT318 18-Volt Cordless Hedge Trimmer recently expired after an encounter with a branch about 3/4 inches thick or less. It was a little more 2 1/2 years old. It's lighter than a gas pole hedge trimmer but not nearly as powerful and not as much reach. The battery and cordless convenience make it a useful addition to the lawn manitenance arsenal if you can have both. This is a light duty unit, however, and if choosing between this and a quality gas pole hedger (or hedge attachment), go with the gas unit if you have significant hedges/trees to trim/shape."
5,Pole Hedge Trimmer,"Fantastic product---will never need another electric or gas hedge trimmer again. Would recommend getting two batteries if you have lots of shrubs to trim, one is enough if can do them in an hour."
2,Not a hardworker,"I had to return this iem due to the fact the motor burned out after 2 days of work.B&D under power thier tools.Black and Deck tools are the Walmart of tools,cheaply made."
5,Great Buy!,"This could be the only book you may need on the topic of public speaking. While the author, Jeff Davidson, says that he is no a speech coach, he certainly has vast experience as to what makes successful presentations and he lavishly shares his experiences, observations, and training with his readers. At $14 this is one of the best buys you will encounter."
3,Guide for Professional Speakers,"The book Public Speaking by Jeff Davidson, was written mostly for professional speakers and not necessarily for classroom use. Our professor did not approve of the book for college students. The information presented can be used as an example."
1,Why Bother?,"This kind of book gets outdated fairly rapidly. In fact, it was obsolete about a month after it appeared on the shelf. This particular book contains pictures of Beanie Babies, tags, etc as well as recipes. This book may not be that interesting to a Beanie Baby collector or to children. This book rarely gives insightful information and collectors are better served with one of the monthly Beanie Baby magazines or the internet."
1,Not as good as their other books,"I have a few of their other beanie baby books and this one just didn't add up to the others. I think they should have done it the original way. Like how they made predictions when the certain beanie would retire. They shouldn't have speant so much time on the cooking part of it, it is a beanie baby book after all. If they make a cooking book it should be seperate."
1,I thought that the book was interesting and helped you find,It showed listings of the values of Beanie Babies. It told you facts about them. It also shared pictures. =)
2,Cute cookbook - no beanie info,I purchased this book at the airport on the run on the merits of their previous book. Had I known I was buying a cute little cookbook I would not have purchased it. The only information in this issue is pictures of the beanies and currents and retireds (which of course is already out dated in some cases). If you want beanie info look somewhere else. If your looking for a cute beanie cookbook buy this book.
5,This book is great for beanie collectors!,It tells me the chances of getting my favorite beanie baby and how popular it is and when it will retire!
5,THIS BOOK HAS GREAT RECIPES AND IT'S REALLY COOL!!,This book is great and it's very informative. It has great pictures and it's interesting! This book is good for collectors AND cooks!! This book is great. Pretty good price!
5,Very CUTE!,This book is very cute! It brings 2 great things (beanies and cooking) together! It has great recipes and valuable beanie information. You will love it!
1,Since when was it a BEANIE BABIES BOOK?,"I have just purchased a copy of this book, I want to return it. It was a waste of money. The previous versions of this book had 1 full page to each Beanie, now, there is just a square. Who wanted to buy a cookbook? They should have called it the Beanie Babies CookBook. I don't recommend that you buy this book, buy the Beanie Babies Summer Collector's Value Guide, it's worth more for your money. Don't pay this much for recipes!"
1,Inaccuracies Galore,"How a company like Ty lets this so-called authority write books like this is crazy! What does he do buy them - randomly throw values at them... You try to sell the beanies at his prices. Good luck. So misleading, wish he would stop ruining the market. Fox is PHONY"
1,STINKS,"The golden goose (Ty, manufacturer of the beanies) should stop letting this coattail riding imposter, who claims he knows something about Beanies... Lets go TY - Put an end to his vacation. Its time you should put out a quality book... NOT THIS!"
5,Great but there's a couple things missing!,"I think this is the best Beanie Baby book I've come across, and it will be for a while, but it's missing a few things! It needs more facts about the individual Beanies such as: reversed tags (and what the reversed tagged Beanies are worth and what they WILL be worth when they retire), reasons WHY they rate them as Recommended or Highly Recommended, reasons they were retired (if they have a reason), and other things like that! Maybe they should think about that for their next edition! I hope you see this Les & Sue Fox! Thanks for taking the time to read this!"
5,The book is perfect for you if you collect beanies.,The gives you hard to get information on Ty's wonderful Beanie Collection. Hope you enjoy it.
5,Cool for Beanie Baby lovers!,"It's the best book you can get for Beanie Baby lovers! It shows your the current Beanie Babies, the retired ones, and it also shows you McDonald's Teenie Beanies. I'm going to buy the next year's book that Les & Sue Fox make."
1,Inaccuracies Galore,"How a company like Ty lets this so-called authority write books like this is crazy! What does he do buy them - randomly throw values at them... You try to sell the beanies at his prices. Good luck. So misleading, wish he would stop ruining the market."
1,The worst Beanie Baby book ever!!!!!!,I think that this book was a diffident wast of money. It has little if any info on beanie babies. All it is is a cookbook. Take my advise and save your money.
1,Cokbook...nuf siad,"check it. site got alot of reviews explains alot 'bout stuff.its...a cookbook, think so anyways: 1. lots of people say sob. books got a cake on the front 3. yeah people say sotheirs my proof got it all set for ya have fun ;)"
2,The Beanie Handbook isn't the best beanie book out there.,"I used to think this book was the greatest, but when I got serious about Beanies, I realized that the prices for this book were so outdated. They're so much cheaper than the realistic prices on the secondary market. Also, the retirment dates are inaccurate. It's a fun book for kids who aren't serious collectors to look at, but it isn't the most accurate or informative."
2,TOO MUCH OTHER STUFF BESIDES THE BEANIES THEMSELVES,half this book is recipes with fancy beanie baby names and if I wanted recipes I would have oredered a recipe book. the other one fourth of the book actually shows the beanies and their prices they are worth.
2,The Beanie Handbook isn't appropriate for real collectors.,"I used to love the beanie handbook when I first got into beanies, but now that I'm a pretty serious collecter, I realize that a lot of it's info is inaccurate. The prices in the book don't compare to the realistic secondary market, and the retirement predicitions are poor. This book is great for little kids to look at, due to its attractive, glossy photos of most every beanie, but I wouldn't reccomend it to people who are really in to collecting beanie babies."
3,Cute book but full of misleading facts!,This book is fun for kids. It's not a adult book and offers many misleading facts. The authors have cleaned up with their publications. I have read articles which make me believe that Ms. Fox is not a true collectors and does not believe that Beanies are worth anything other than a childs toy! Sure could of fooled me by the book!
3,There are some mistakes,"On the page with the multicolored Iggiuana you have his name as Rainbow ,But his name is Iggy. (page 88) And on the page with the blue Chamealon you have his name as Iggy, but his name is really Rainbow.(page 66) That could be confusing alot of viewers! You just have there names mixed up."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK - Not for Collectors,"If I wanted a receipe book I would have purchased one, 69 out of 215 pages were related to Beanies, the rest of the book is a waste of time. I really was looking for a good collector book, like the last one. I will never purchase a book from this author again. I hope they understand that people who want to collect don't want stupid receipes included in a collectors edition book. Again I ssy this book is a big waste of MONEY. Don't waste your money."
3,it was wonderful,"I loved the book. I especially loved the songs. I really enjoyed looking at the pictures. I love the recipies in the cookbook, I've had some and they're great! The only problem was the prices were in-accurate."
1,I was very disappointed!,"I anxiuosly waited for the arrival of my Beanie Baby Handbook Fall 1998 Edition. When I did finally receive it, I was disappointed that it was not worth the wait. I have the 1997 edition of the Handbook written by the same authors and I was quite pleased with it. There was one page dedicated to each Beanie Baby with valuable information on each. This edition dedicates one page each to the new releases. The older Beanies are given a small square with a value listed. The rest of the book is dedicated to cooking! Maybe this book should be catagorized as a cookbook."
1,This isn't what the last book was.,The last book in January was an excellent resource for the Beanie collector and children alike. This one has 14 pages on the new ones and most of the book is just recipes and cute beanie pictures. I was *very* disappointed in this one.
5,This one is the best!,"I bought this book when I first started collecting Beanies, and it was VERY helpful and informative. I've seen the other books on the market but don't think they compare. I've already ordered the 1998 edition, and it's not even published yet!"
5,The Beanie Handbook is good for new to medium collectors.,"My dad went to Chicago and got this book for me. I was a beginner in the world of Beanie Babies and the book really told me a lot about the beanies. It gave a small, but very interesting, view of each beanie, past and future. The beginning of the book gave an interesting account on the original creation and start of Ty Inc. My favorite part was the pictures, I never knew there were so many Beanie Babies! Thanks to this book, I've been introdued to the wonderful world of Beanie Baby collecting."
5,One of the most comprehensive guides out there,"The authors made this book easy to understand, and comprehend. It's great for kids and adults alike!I love the pictures because it gives me a better idea of what the beanie looks like before I go and purchase it. I also enjoyed the summaries at the bottom of each page. They are cute and could really make a child's imagination go wild.Though this book does not have the older retireds or pictures of the older New Releases, it is still a fine book to have in your beanie library. And for the price, you can't go wrong!"
3,Very good book.,"This book was very good. Not only did it list recipes, but it listed the updated value of Beanie Babies at the time. I highly recommend you buy this book!"
3,Fox needs to get a clue,"I'm glad they jumped ahead - Fox needs to put out the prior year while trying (in vain?) to catch up. While the 'sodes are pretty good - I had given up watching them a few years ago when they seemed marginal and more political, but this season seems better. Fox REALLY needs to read these reviews and quit shafting devoted viewers. The packaging is atrocious, the extras are none, despite available options (The Spurlock guys 20 season tribute good have been put on these discs, but wasn't, for example), and I really don't care about the commentaries - watch South Park's - they're just a couple minutes yet get the point across. And of course, they're still very far behind in producing the sets, wihcih is positively maddening. Ironically Matt Groening would appear to have become what he used to so eloquently made fun of! Buy the set,but, for me, who was a rabid Simpson's fan between 1990 and 2000, they've become ""meh""."
5,20th Season a good One.,We love the Simpsons and this new 20th season episodes were great. Possibly the best season yet as we laughed the whole time.
5,Lifelong Simpson's Fan!,"I will be the first to admit the the Simpson's have gone down hill since starting out. That being said this is still a decent season, and worth watching if you crave the Simpson's on a regular basis and cannot get your fix via regular TV channels."
3,Shop around for better prices,Rite Aid carries tv series dvd new and at half the price of say Best Buy.I am really surprised what good titles they have and how reasonably priced dvds are. I got my Simpsons 20 season new and got 20 percent off with my wellness card.What they are asking for it in cyberspace is ridiculous.Shop around and you can still add the not so hot dvds at a much reasonable price. I stopped Collecting simpsons after season 11 but this was a deal for 12 bucks.I am gonna watch these since I stopped watching the original telecasts long ago and see if they are really as bad as some of these reviews has said.Always wait some time for dvds to be out eventually the sky high prices will fluctuate.I got my Thriller dvd set when a used one was up 49 bucks instead of 120 bucks like they wanted when it first came out.Every now and then a seller has good used price.
2,"In the words of Lisa Simpson, "",,,meh.""","A solid season of episodes, but after what we've come to expect from The Simpsons in terms of great DVD releases, this one falls flat. Here's to hoping for a rerelease with commentaries and other goodies when its turn comes again in the lineup."
2,No commentaries or special features,"I have all seasons of The Simpsons available on DVD. I enjoy the commentaries and special features as much as the programs themselves. I was disappointed this 20th Season of The Simpsons on Blu-ray lacked any commentaries or special features. I enjoyed the programs as per usual, though."
3,No extras at all???,"I've worshiped the Simpsons since Season 1 (no, I'm not hip enough to have watched the Tracy Ullman show). I have purchased all the DVD sets on the day of their release, and this one was no exception. While I continue to love the show (despite the fact that they've lost at least one step from their prime some years back), this was the first time I've felt disappointed, and even ripped off, by a Simpsons release.No commentaries? No deleted scenes? No storyboards or other in-depth analysis? No fair!This was, in plain terms, a pathetic rush-to-market release that is a disservice to loyal Simpsons fans. I would not recommend this product to anyone.I still give it three stars because after all, it's the Simpsons. But when you combine the fact that these are late-era shows with no extra features, it's really 2 1/2 stars rounded up.Shame on you, Matt Groening! You're still one of my heroes, but this is about the lamest thing I've ever seen your name associated with."
2,No Extras!,"This DVD set has no extra features other than a PROMO for the Anniversary Special. I probably should have read the fine print, but after the other DVD sets I had much higher expectations. What was the point of them releasing this other than a cheap grab at some quick cash? Ugh."
2,First ever thumbs down for Simpsons :(,"The moment I popped it in and saw there was no commentary track, or deleted scenes, or anything worth paying money to own, I promptly returned it to the store."
2,Lackluster at best,"I received this set as a gift for my birthday and was fairly excited about it because I knew they had switch to an HD format mid-season. I began watching it and, while I enjoyed the episodes, I was extremely disappointed by the complete and total lack of ANY extra features. If you purchase this set, you get the episodes and that is it. No commentary, no deleted scenes, no foreign language clips, nothing else at all. So, look at the price of this and unless it is on sale for around ten or fifteen dollars, don't purchase it because, if you are used to the season 1-12 DVD sets, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. I was."
3,Great show dissapointing Blu-Ray,"Not going to talk about the show so much, everyone has there opinions about the show and its later seasons. It stands to reason season 20 would have season 20 episodes but that is all we get. The extra is insulting. It is a promotional piece to watch a show that already aired. It does not make sense that it is here. As you either already saw the special or this ""promo clip"" is just a way of laughing at you for missing it. Buy this Blu-Ray if you want the episodes but don't bother if you are looking for goodies. What is even worse is that is not even less expensive than previous sets that where loaded with goodies. They couldn't even add a BD-Live feature so if they wanted to get the episodes out now and provide some goodies later it would at least be something. Shame on this release. Sub-Standard. I would have rather had seasin 13 with all the extras and waited for this."
2,Not as great as the others,"I just bought this today just because I love the Simpsons; And to be honest this set sucks! Sure they start getting better this season but this set sucks because there are no special features. There isn't even a greeting from Matt Groening like the previous sets. Honestly this is not the kind of thing we expect from the crew that works on these sets but maybe they were just rushed into doing a crappy release for the 20th season. In that case it still sucks because this is the season they should have celebrated the most with. They should of had so many special features and Easter eggs that you would get tired of looking for them after a while. This is the first Simpson set that I give a bad review to for the simple reason that there is no special features, commentary, or any other great thing like the first sets had. The only good thing about this series is that the episodes start to get good again.JD"
2,Disappointing.,"I have always liked the Simpsons box sets. The best parts are the special features, the commentaries and the booklet with information about the episodes and such. This had none of those. Its basically just the show on a disc. If that's all you want than great but until now they have all had extras, what happened? Also, because its BD I expected the entire season to be the new high definition stuff, its not. They switched to the HD mid-season. That part is not really their fault, that's when they made the switch but the lack of features, commentaries or quality packaging is completely their fault. I can see them re-releasing this one because this is just bad and the fans are not going to take it. The problem is now I am stuck with this one."
2,Worst Box Set Ever,"I've pruchased all previous box sets. I've grown accustomed to the commentary tracks. In fact, they were the first thing I listened to. The lack of them is clearly a FOX decision because the chose to jump ahead to season 20 ASAP and didn't leave Matt & crew time to create commentary tracks. They may have got my cash but hopefully they won't get yours if you are looking for extras. If FOX decides to continue this approach, I won't purchase more DVDs. Oh well, I can always watch them in syndication."
1,NO EXTRA'S!?,"This not a review of the show, this a review of the product. I love the program. I have all the previous seasons on DVD that have been released so far, and was really looking forward to this one. However, I foolishly didn't read the reviews on it before I had purchased it. If I had, it would have saved me the trip to the post office to return it. AS others have stated, THERE ARE NO EXTRA'S! NO COMMENTARIES, NO DELETED SCENES, NO REASON TO OWN IT! All of the episodes are available to watch/download somewhere online, so why pay $35 for this? I would understand if they didn't have time to do commentary on all the episodes (though I do enjoy them), but to not include any special features is just lame. Please, don't buy this. This mediocrity is inexcusable."
1,Worst Season Ever!! (a la Comic Book Guy),"A cartoon needs four elements: animation, a plot, humor, and dialogue (although dialogue is optional). The first eight or so seasons of The Simpsons had all four in spades. Season 20, however, had only three: animation, a plot, and dialogue. There was absolutely NO humor - nothing even close. I sat and watched every episode without even cracking a smile. Yet, I can go back, watch the early seasons over again, and still laugh every time. Why doesn't this show hire some writers with a sense of humor??"
5,Simpsons are the best,"I love the Simpsons, but I hate shopping. it was so much easier to get it online. great dvd though"
3,Bought as a gift........,"I purchased this item as a gift and have not personally reviewed it. However, since I have had no sarcistic remarks from the 'gifted party', I am assuming that he was not terribly offended by having received it as a XMAS present. Furthermore, since he is taking me to dinner tomorrow evening (my bithday) and then to the Broward Center to see Les Miserables, I think it is safe to assume that he is either happy with his gift or has not had a chance to review himself.If, however, I am found slain in the streets of Fort Lauderdale following tomorrow evening's performance of Les Miserables, I want you to know that the giftee's name is Glen ......"
1,Junk packaging will scratch discs after one use,Plain and simple..... the joke for packaging for this set is pure cheap business on FOX's part. They charge top dollar to us but give junk that scratches the discs on the first time you have to pull them from the packaging. The greed coming from US and world business owners is getting old. There is just no actual care for the products or people anymore. JUST $$$$$$$$$
2,it's The Simpsons.... but they cut corners,"I gave this dvd box set a 2 star rating, like tons of others. I read them all before I purchased it. But I went ahead and bought it anyways. I have all of the other seasons. I'm the biggest Simpsons fan ever. But they really did cut corners to get this realeased. I don't really care about the commentaries. I care about the cheap packaging. The discs just slide in cardboard slots. I've taken them out 2 times and they are allready starting to skip. I had to put them into different cases. Now the box just sits here with no discs in it. It'll get thrown to the side to collect dust after while. Also, I don't like the etch-a-sketch look alike pictures that grace the top of the episode selection pages. I always wake-up in the middle of the night to those screens. And I really wish they put more effort into making them better. They really rushed this set. I expected so much more for the 20th anniversary."
1,I waited 20 years for this ?????????????????????????????????????????????,"FOX PLEASE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LOW BLOW ...... WHY RELEASE THIS DVD w/o any of these features.........THE DVD's ARE POPULAR BUT NOT WHEN THEY ARE BARE BONED. PLEASE GO BACK TO TWO SEASONS A YEAR ALSO1/5Five things that would have made this an awesome release1- Commentary2- Deleted scenesStop right there and you have a decent release. Not feature packed, but good enough to be the definitive season 20.3- The complete 20th Anniversary Documentary as the lone bonus featureNow you have a worthwhile release4- 20th anniversary contest winners galleryremember that big poster contest? why not showcase the winners in a simple image gallery?5- The Tracy Ullman shortsEven if only a handful are available for release, stick on one or two per disc. its a small extra, sure, but a great way to tie together the 20th anniversary"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SET IF YOU CARE ABOUT COMMENTARY,"I've been a Simpsons fan for a long time. I own all of the previous 13 season sets and I've watched them all multiple times, even when the show itself started to get less appealing. I watched them because the commentaries were fun to listen to, I enjoyed hearing about the production and the writers/producers had interesting things to say. Every single episode for 13 seasons has a commentary track with someone discussing something and then Fox goes and releases this crap with not a single one. Nothing. DO NOT BUY THIS SET IF YOU CARE ABOUT COMMENTARY. I want my $30 back."
3,Just OK,"This set has all the episodes from season 20 and one featurette, a 3:30 minute look at the 20th Season Anniversary Special. The one thing that I felt was missing was the Introduction by Matt Groening that was in the other sets. I haven't got to the HD episodes yet but with only one extra the set is just okay, nothing special about it. The one nice thing was since it was the Blu-ray set there is more episodes per disk. For the 20th season I just expected more."
3,"Gee, I almost feel bad for making a review here","Well, I bought this from the store and opened it on the way home. I was disappointed at first because of the way the box opens, and the discs were already scratched from the design of the disc-holders. The episodes were pretty great, as I've never seen these on FOX, since I stopped watching after season 12 and I'm a LIFELONG Simpsons fan. I have seasons 1-10 and I love them, they are surely a part of my life. But the problem is that this one (like all the ratings despise so far also) lacks commentary or anything special about it being season 20! What gives? No commentary?? AT LEAST put commentary even if it sucks lol. Maybe some cool stickers? Something! With the fact that most of the reviews are ONE star, I won't say anything else. But the lack of commentary is just... wtf?"
3,Not one of the great seasons,"The episodes are just okay and if you watch The Simpsons everyday you have seen them a million times, also the packaging could have been better."
2,disapointing,very disappointing they rushed this out just for the 20th anniversary of the series there is no commentary or any extra features just the episodes
1,i was soooooooooo disappointed!,"let me just echo the earlier reviews in saying that this was a lame ass set. it has nothing in it! no commentaries, deleted scenes, nothing! luckily i got it on sale, ut unfortunately i spent the last of my money for the month and it's only the fourth..."
2,Se extraña la ausencia de traducción en español,"Además de saltarse varias temporadas, han decidido no incluir la traducción en español de los capítulos (por lo menos es lo que dice en las características). He comprado en Amazon casi todas las temporadas que han salido, precisamente por la oportunidad (mucho antes de que se encuentre en mi país) y porque contiene la traducción en español. Espero que FOX incluya el doblaje de esta temporada. Si es así, con toda seguridad la compraré."
3,20TH SEASON FOR 20TH ANNIVERSARY,"Not really a review, although I did like some of the gags in Season 20 while others left me scratching my head, but I thought I'd point out the obvious reason why they skipped from Season 12 to Season 20 in the DVD releases. Fox is making a big deal about celebrating the show's 20th anniversary. In fact, the 20th Anniversary Special airs January 10, two days before this release. 20th Anniversary - 20th Season. As Homer might say, ""Well duh!"""
1,Worst Boxset Ever,"What a pity that FOX chose to ""celebrate"" The Simpsons by attempting to pawn off such a low-grade product on fans of the show. Woo-hoo, a dirth of specials, a missing documentary, and not enough preparation to include the standard commentaries, all for much MUCH more than the standard boxset price- it would make sense if FOX was the type of corporation to rip everyone off for more by means of some sort of ""20th season frenzy"" in which people could no longer recall how much previous boxsets cost and what they included. No, I'm not purchasing this set, neither new nor used, but the sad part is that this anticlimactic action has no remedy in a lovingly crafted boxset that would in fact celebrate this institution."
1,First Simpsons Season I WIll Not Buy.,"As a long time fan of the Simpsons (They began to air when I was 4) I have gotten every season released so far.I like listening to the commentaries and checking out the extras.The Simpsons box sets have always set a high standard, filled to the brim with extras and commentaries on every episode.That is one thing that originally set it apart from some other series, the disc full of commentary.It is sad that this was an obviously a rushed job, and I sadly will not buy it.Hopefully if enough people boycott and complain they will release an improved version.I feel bad for the people who already bought it and expected more."
2,Why Bother?,"Why is Fox even releasing the twentieth season? The only special feature on the entire set is a ""SNEAK PEEK"" of the Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special, directed by Morgan Spurlock.What I ask is how they call it a sneak peek when the special airs two days before the release of this boxset. Thay have got geniuses working at FOX I presume.No other features are available!!! I find this ridiculous of a season boxset to be released with no features whatsoever. If so, it should cost a fair amount less.Don't buy this fans, FOX is stiffing you, simply for the money!!"
2,Angry sucker's rant..,"Remember that special you watched 2 days ago? Well here's a sneak peak. Oh yeah, about the commentaries....well we decided against them, so sorry. Finally, we decided to not include any special features aside from the sneak peak mentioned earlier. We figured you'd buy it anyways. Oh yeah, we got the complaints about the packaging that scratches the disks and don't care so stop bothering us. Enjoy!!!This is what that figurative mud being thrown in your face feels like. Oh well, I love The Simpson's so much that I am not entirely frowning."
1,This Sucks!,There are no special features just the shows not even any deleted scenes... You should buy this bootleg for this kind of quality!
1,"Yo, FOX, if insulting Simpsons fans was your goal, give yourself an A+!","Talk about complete contempt for an audience that has made the FOX network MILLIONS of dollars in revenue over two decades of the amazing Simpsons. Please tell me Matt G. did NOT give his approval for this ""grab the cash & run"" marketing smack in the face to loyal fans across the globe. Crappy packaging. No extras. All because a few episodes are in HD? So what? I'd rather have waited, continued to buy the seasons in proper order, and gotten a Season Twenty DVD set that should have blown me away with retrospectives, commentary, the actual Special (not a tease for a show that preceded the DVD release date), and so much more. This is the first Simpsons DVD set I will NOT be buying. Shame on you, Fox. Truly. Shame."
1,No commentaries? No thank you! A VERY POOR EFFORT.,I am a huge fan of this show and I am VERY disappointed with the Season 20 release. I always enjoy watching all the episodes with the commentaries on so I can get some background info and related stories about each episode. This release has no commentaries and no extras. I am more than happy to wait a couple of extra months so they can do all the commentary tracks and add the extras etc. I suppose they are just trying to get the seasons out as fast as possible rather than put out a quality product. Shame on you! You have lost a very loyal fan (and I'm sure I'm not the only one). I will keep watching but I will never buy another season on DVD.
4,Disappointing lack of features,"While I am pleased to have the first season of The Simpsons to be released on Blu-ray, it is very disappointing that the set is completely lacking features... no extras, no commentaries, no nothing. It could have been a five-star, but D'oh!"
3,"OK season, crappy packaging","I've always been a fan of the simpsons and still am to this day. The only thing I've had a problem with, along with ALOT of other people is the packaging. With the release of this season this past Tuesday I was hoping Fox would finally decide to fix the problem boy was I wrong. Not only are the disc in basically the same type as the last two seasons but now you have to remove it from a box that features all the characters."
3,Most live shows don't make it to 20 years.,"But, I do agree with the viewers who say this show has lost it's way. However, as soon as the writers realize that these are cartoon characters they are dealing with and therefore can put them into any unplauseable situation they want to, I'm sure the episodes will improve, (as they have with season's 21 & 22, at least I think they have.) But, they're always other channels to watch - ya know, Lifetime, with their very deep story's on woman's issues and/or the deep wisdom of the Kardashian's, Bad Girls Clubs, and Jersey Shore, duh? I'll take Do'h! over Duh? anytime."
1,NO EXSTRAS,This is one of the reason why people download things off the net.. You would have to same result... Only thing you wouldnt have is the packageing.. witch for this season was all paper and the disks are not safe and can be damaged easaly... I had to put my disks in another case.. This season was a let down one of the only reason i buy this is for the comintary.Buy the Venture Brothers... Thats some good comintary.
2,Lacking,"No commentaries or extras features. So it was disappointing that they were not added. Wish that this season was not rushed since its a milestone and would have been great if there was MORE extras than the normal dvds. Like 'Simpson 20+ years in the making' documentary.I did by this knowing that there was no extra content but fearful that this will no be released again so picked it up anyways. I'm am not sure if its just my copy but it skips. Fresh from the box and a DVD player that cause no issues with other movies I play. All the disk does this, free of dust and scratches so I cannot enjoy watching this and am not sure if I could return it do bad disk.2 stars, since no extras but I usually only watch them once anyways."
2,"Okay, if you just want to watch the show","Unlike every other season of the show released on video, there are no commentaries, deleted scenes, or other extras related to the episodes. The only thing other than the episodes is a ""preview"" of the Morgan Spurlock documentary that Fox has already aired (although it does have some brief snippets of things that were not in the finished documentary, like Morgan attending an Albuquerque Isotopes game). Also keep in mind that half of the episodes are not widescreen, as Fox did not make the switch to HD until the middle of the season. If you want the full-featured version, I assume you will just have to wait until they get to season 20 in the normal releases...which should be sometime around 2017...assuming they haven't switched from discs to something else (like SDs, or just having everything downloadable)."
2,Don't Pay Full Price For This Season,"I'll start by saying that the only reason I bought this set is because it was on Golden Box Deals for $13.99. My advice to anyone contemplating buying this is to wait until that deal comes around again, because this set has NO special features whatsoever. If you're someone that doesn't care about special features, then ignore this (and all of the other reviews on here) and either buy this set as is, or buy it digitally, where I'm sure it's cheaper.Unfortunately, at the rate Fox is going, it's still going to be several years before Season 20 gets released properly along with the earlier seasons that have already been released."
2,not anything like what we expect.,"I wish I hadn't bought this season. The simpsons dvds are usually so well done. But with this release they've gone from being the best to worst then the rest. There are no commentaries at all, and no special features. This is no way to celebrate 20 years on the air. The packaging is the cardboard acordian. I can't wait for the corners to come unglued and the disks to fall out, like they do on the other seasons with this packaing. I'm totally frustrated. I will never preorder a season of the simpson's again."
1,Disappointed,"It's bad enough seeing the early sets selling for a 1/4 of the price I originally paid, now I come home with an $$$ blu-ray with NO EXTRAS. I was a fool and didn't read the back - thinking at the very least it would contain commentary and the 20th anniversary Special that just aired on Fox. As Bush tried to say ""Fool me once, shame on..... shame on you, you fool me ...can't get fooled again!!!"" I'm a big Simpson's fan, but I'm done buying these."
2,The Unofficial Simpsons 20th Season Box Set,"Although the season has great episodes, especially the 2nd half with the transitioned to HD, this box set fails to include any special feature what so ever. First off, no commentaries; The commentaries are the reason these sets sell because it makes a detail description on the process on how the episodes came to be, both good and bad episodes. Second, no 20th Anniversary feature where the cast and crew discuss on their experiences on working on the show for 20 years. And finally, no intro from Matt Groening; it feels that Groening had no involvement on this release, thus making it an unofficial box set.For those fans who just want to see the episodes and don't care for the features, this set is a must buy. For the rest, I suggest avoid this product and wait for the eventual box set with all the special features, including The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special in 3D on Ice!, in the near future."
1,"No, no, no!!","I am SO disappointed with season 20!! I am a HUGE simpson's fan...I'm one of those people that quote The Simpson's all the time. So when I saw the DVD on amazon for pre-order I was SO close to pre-ordering it but I was unsure what episodes were part of the 20th season. I ended up deciding that I would rent it off Netflicks first. Boy, I'm glad I did that!! Netflicks only sends out one DVD at a time and after watching two discs, I deleted the other discs of my list! I agree with the other reviewers: this season just sucks!!"
2,Too Soon,"While it might be cool to reflect 20 years of Simpsons history, this is not the way to do it. As a collector, this extremely irritates me. I hate it when they release the last season before the earlier seasons. (Like they did with ""Fraiser"" and it confused me when I was buying them as gifts). And while this isn't the last season, it gives all the more reason not to release it this early. The season in all was OK, but not really good. Once they went to HD, they short of forgot what made a good episode, although there are a few surprises along the way.Bottom line: They better rerelease this season after they make 13-19 and give it all the commentaries and special features it deserves."
3,"Ep. 1-9 Full-screen SD, Ep. 10-21 Widescreen HD","I just wanted to let people thinking about buying this to know that only 12 of the episodes are 1080p HD Widescreen, while the first 9 are full-screen upconverted to 1080p. So it looks like the first disc is the non-HD while the second disc is all widescreen and in true HD.This let me down a bit when I found out. But it's still nice to have at least some of the season in HD. Would have been nice to have the whole thing though. Ah well.But don't let the description fool you into thinking it's ALL widescreen. It's not."
1,Worst DVD Boxset ever!!!,"This is just a LAZY release.The boxsets have been getting progressively worse and worse.Fewer special features ... and OMG the super crappy cases are not good foractually watching the series. taking the discs inand out are a pain and ifdone very often will ruin the discs.I was expecting better for such a ""Special"" release."
2,Bone of Contention: A Huge Disappointment,"I'd foolishly assumed that The Simpsons crew had worked really hard to put together their usual incredibly superlative efforts into this out-of-sequence celebratory release. It's just the episodes. No booklet with airdates and trivia, no commentaries, nothing but a ""preview"" of the special which was aired prior to the release. (I'd thought they might even have included the special.)Fox has generated a lot of ill-will with this release. And of course I've opened it, so I can't send it back."
2,"Still The Simpsons, but a complete let down otherwise","As others have said, no commentary, no Groening intro, one small special about the Morgan Spurlock 20th Anniversary special.After 12 seasons of full commentary on every epiode, this is really disappointing."
1,Cash grab,"This set is nothing more then a cash grab by fox, There is nothing here beyond the episodes. While the Simpson's have had there up and downs over the last 21 years you could count on the DVD sets being filled to the brim with extras. I can not describe my disappointment with this set when i finished the first disk and went to start the commentaries and found none.I just feel sickened that fox will see this as a Success based on people buying these expecting the same quality of the last 12 sets"
4,Great product,Great product. Every since i've been using it people have been telling me how soft my hair is. I would buy it again
3,It's ok,"This product was just ok for me, I wouldn't purchase it again and not that it is bad but I would rather try something else..."
4,Giovanni Hair care,"I really do love this product. I have ""mixed"" hair and when I saw that it was the light formula, I was a little nervous because I usually use very heavy, thick conditioners but this product works great. Less is more though. If I get happy and use too much, my curls won't form as well. I can't wait to try more Giovanni products. I don't think I'll go back to my old hair care products, ever."
5,Compelling and different,"Javaid Qazi's stories are steeped in the traditions of great storytellers, both Western and Asian, yet it is in his use of language that he truly shines.President Sahib's Blue Period, a satirical tale of Asian despotism, is worth the price of the book, and the King of Patio World is a hilarious look at lifestyles of the middle class and grasping."
5,Best fragrance ever!,Great Product!! I would buy it from this vendor again! The perfume isnt that strong but it smells good!
4,He's the man,"Fascinating man, with a rich background. Great resource is you are looking to understand this great American composer. (Especially from his own words)"
2,An utterly lifeless survey history,"This book presents the facts, yet fundamentally lacks any flavor for the absolutely remarkable story of Rome's Republic and Empire. The reader gets an outline with very little analysis or depth, a truly boring read. Unfortunately, it was this book that I first studied as a classics civ major, indeed it was the first history book I tried to seriously study. It is so dull - I just picked it up to peruse as I am reading a wonderfully meaty book by Peter Heather - that I threw it away.Not recommended. THis is the kind of book that turns young people off to history."
2,Ugh...don't bother unless you have to,"Too many perverted vampires and rape scenes. Oh, how the mighty have fallen...."
5,IT ROCKS!!!!,For all of you fans who thought Anita and Jean Claude would make the most dynamic couple ever well you were right. Anita can still put him in his place and Richard is left in the proverbial doghouse!
3,This series is losing me :(,"Hmmm, I noticed that many of the reviews here don't go into any sort of plot description here. I couldn't figure it out at first but now that I've finished rereading this I get it. There isn't one.Well, that's not quite true. There were threads of plot, the vampire council has come to town to rape and pillage the beasties, but really this book is all about Anita gaining power, dealing with her two lover boys and gaining new puppy doggies and kitties who follow her every command. It's bloody, it's sexual but mostly in a vile, violent way and it's so not my favorite of the series. I think I need a break from these books now. I found myself getting grouchy and bored with the oh-so-perfect and all-powerful Anita. I want tomboy Anita The Vampire Executioner back and as much as I complained about the Nike swish descriptions in the earlier books I'd give anything to have them back. If I have to read another description of a whored up Anita outfit I'm going to gag."
1,Uggh! Laurell K. Hamilton has done MUCH better.,"I have all the Anita Blake books, and most of them are worn out from reading and re-reading, but this one got one reading, and was tossed. The plot was slim to none, the brutality was terrible, it was just useless. Luckily she got back on track with Blue Moon. Read the rest of the series, but do yourself a favor and skip this one."
5,Burnt offerings,"My daughter just loves the Author and her series, She was just so excited to start this book she has received for Christmas!"
4,Good story,"This is about the second sci-fi book I've ever bought (my first Anita Blake book, though), and now I'm hooked in vampires, werewolves, and the like. I adore Anita, it's about time someone wrote about a heroine who's not a six-feet tall bundle of muscles, Linda Hamilton style; we small women can be real tough, too. The story is interesting and engrossing, although I could do without the parts where hunky werewolf ex-boyfriend Richard is quarreling with Anita, it's totally irrelevant to the story and besides, it should be illegal for exes to behave the way Richard does; no wonder she liked Jean Claude better, he's just divine and doesn't whine as much. Anyway, what else I can say about this book? It's a fun read, toss it in your beach bag and enjoy."
1,Blue Moom,"Laurell Hamilton is one of the premier writers of the gendre of our times! She is funny, thoughtful and keeps my wife and I intrigued at every point. It is sad, then, that we both feel Blue Moon was a terrible, disappointing book. We have read all her books with rapt attention-could not put them down. This was a major disappointment. The sudden change in personality, moral values,etc. was not in keeping with the character. The excessive,rambling,(and quite frankly, boring) delving into the ""pack"" behaviour served no purpose to the plot and left us feeling empty and disappointed. While I could relate to where the author was trying to go, the execution was pitiful. We will purchase the next book, but this one goes in the trash. We sincerly hope Laurell K. Hamilton is not offended by our review; she is extremely talented! I am sure she feels that this is not her best work. Sincerly, Frank & Pam Cannon"
3,nothing special,"This is the first Anita Blake novel I have read and, while I found that it was competently done, there was little in the way of real atmosphere or suspense. Maybe it's just me, but I found it was just another generic genre fantasy novel (I was expecting something more horror than fantasy). This would probably appeal most to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer crowd or those who enjoy those massive multi-charactered series novels."
2,anita blake seems to have done it all already,"I love the Anita blake vampire series and have eagerly read every book in the series so far. I read this one and was left thinking, is this it? She spends a lot of time catching the reader up on the various sub-plots from the other books. There is so much going on now it gets in the way of the plot. I hope the next book gets better."
4,"Not her best, but still very good","I started the book on Wednesday morning and finished it that afternoon. It's a fast read, very enjoyable. I'm finding I don't like some of the characters as well as I used to, while other characters are fast becoming like old friends.The story doesn't hang together as tightly as some of her previous books, but it still works. It works very, very well."
5,Excellent Reading,"This book was extremely good, a great follow up to the other seven books in the series. Very fast paced and exciting. I love how tough anita is and I think her and the master vampire Jean-Claude are a great couple. If you like vampire novels you have to read Burnt Offerings and the other Anita Blake books."
5,Thrills and Chills You'll Love!!!,"I have recamended this book to all of my friends and all of them have become as hooked on the series as I am. It's become kind of a game with us. We all try to get the new release before any of the others so that we can be the first to read it. We are all hooked! It's great reading with intriguing charecters and intense action. The main charecter, Anita Blake, has a wonderful sence of humer and a tallent for saying the wrong thing at the right time consistantly getting her into trouble that will leave the reader in stitches. A lot of the settings are grusome and written with a talent that draws the reader into the story, so Anita's sarcastic wit is a ""light in the darkness"" so to say. I have looked for other books like this book and I have not found anything that could compare. This series is one of a kind. I am egerly awaiting the next book."
4,"A good addition to the series, but...","I'm still enjoying this series, but didn't like this book as much as the others. The plot was too disjointed, with too many threads started, then dropped. Most were wrapped up by the end, but it could've been a smoother read along the way with better planning. This uneven plotting made the book less of a page-turner than the others, but it was still interesting enough for 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars. Moving on to the next one. :)"
4,Great Book :),"Burnt Offerings is one of the best action packed books of the series. Some of the earlier ones focused more on the police work and this does too but it also gets really into Anita's personal life (and relationships) and has some moments where you wonder who's going to make it. Great as always, Laurell K. Hamilton! Absolutely loved it and can't wait to get the next one."
4,I couldn't put the book down!,"Laurell Hamilton has done it to me again! BURNT OFFERINGS is the latest book in the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series that has kept me up reading until the wee hours of the morning (something I rarely do). Although I'm not a vampire buff, the author's premium writing style and deliciously complex characters make this book a page turner. One of the problems that the protagonist faced needed more attention, but the other plot lines more than made up for it. Regarding the firepower: it's nice to see an author that has done their research before incorporating things into a story.The author's capacity for realism and ability to plunge the reader into a whole range of emotions make this book a must read!!"
2,Eh...Robert Is Better.,"I love this series. But this book was a serious disappointment.If you haven't read the previous book, Anita chose Jean Claude and now are openly going out. Well a friend of Jean Claude drops by and brings friends, the vampire council, after they're introduced, I found the plot a little unbelievable and kind of bleh.I found it painful to read and Anita, not Anita."
1,"Too Much Talking, Not Enough Action","The characters, especially the undead, go on and on and on about how powerful they are, but never really do anything. Everyone seems to act so powerful with all their threats, but in the end, nothing seems very impressive. In only a few books, Hamilton makes it appear that Anita is as powerful as the vampire council... which is ridiculous. I won't be giving this series another chance..."
3,Anita Blake's appeal is slipping,This book was the turning point in my affection for Anita. I enjoyed all the books previously for their suspense and character interplay. Now I find myself slogging through several story lines and the climax happens in a page or two with everything ending in peaches and cream no matter how much of a stretch. Anita was better when she was not all powerful.
1,Series running out of steam.,"Poor Anita, she is becoming what she used to fear most, one of the monsters. This book seems like a rehash of the last one. Burnt Offerings was very predictable... a somewhat confused Anita, a tortured Richard, a cool Jean Claude. Change the names of the bad guys, and you pretty much have the same book as The Killing Dance.The ""mine is bigger than yours"" confrontations are getting tiresome. These episodes seem to be required every second or third chapter, and in most cases are anti-climatic, or just plain juvenile.I've always looked forward to the next new book, not anymore. I think Anita needs a rest, a long one. Where's Edward when you need him?"
3,Burnt out after this novel,"I enjoy this novel and the six previous ones also. However, I got burnt out after reading this book. Anita never has a day off and never relaxes with her boyfriend (or its not depicted in the novel--we're just told these days occur). I stopped here, and cannot read Blue Moon. Sorry Hamilton, give Anita the day off please--and write about it!!!"
5,I found it to be quite facinating and exciting.,"In my opinion this book is so far, the best of the Anita Blake series. I have all 7 of them and the story just got better with each book. The Anita Blake character has grown so much throughout the series. All I can say is that I wait anxiously for the next book in the series to come out."
3,Good but not as good as its prequels,"The summary of the book is misleading. The book is not Anita Blake investigating some pyromaniac intent on destroying vampires. The plot is that the three main protagonists have to answer to a more powerful force for actions which happened in one of the prequels (Circus of the Damned).The main reason why this book disappointed me was that instead of the book being a supernatural detective novel, it was far more of an adventure story. The heroes lurched from one life threatening situation to another, with very little mystery. The other reason why I felt let down is that Anita Blake's powers seem to be far too powerful. Unlike earlier books, where you felt that she was a human with a little something extra, she now ranks with the top monsters.This book is still an enjoyable read, just don't expect it to be as good as the prequels."
3,Not her best..,"First off let me say I am a big fan of Hamilton's Anita Blake series and I understand that in series some books are better than others. Well, let me say that Burnt Offerings was my LEAST favorite. For some reason this book left me cold. I thought the story was slow and not in keeping with her usual faster paced stories. There were scenes that I felt were drawn out, especially were Anita is helping put out the fires and rescuing the vampires. And even that scene came late in the book, although the cover tells us that this is what the story is mainly about. I think Hamilton was short on ideas for this book and could have easily moved straight from The Killing Dance to Blue Moon WITHOUT this one. The only interesting thing about the book was the introduction of Asher, Jean- Claude's old friend. I thought his character was appealing and I look forward to seeing him in future books. But this one didn't do it for me, but dont' worry I will love Anita Blake no matter what!"
4,"Really good read, but too many plot lines competing.","I really loved this book, but I thought that there were just too many plot lines trying to vie for the spotlight. I would have loved to see 2-3 of the minor plot lines pulled away and the space used to further develop Anita's now ""extended"" family, or to flesh out the protagonists. Sometimes ""less"" really is ""more"". There were some points when I had to wonder if the girl ever sleeps!! All in all it was a very good book and I WILL be back for the next one."
4,Still going strong..,"Again Anita Blake brings it. The drama that unfolds with Jean-Claude and Richard keeps me enthralled. As the series goes on I am starting to realize that Anita Blake is changing. She is getting more and more wrapped up in the world of ""monsters"" I am still enjoying this series and recommend it to anyone!"
3,Super Reader,"Somebody has decided that vampires are toasty, or good to toast, or burn prettily. Anyway, vampire torchings are what Anita has to investigate in this book.It is also becomes public that she is doing the head vamp of her city.Because she bumped off their boss, Anita becomes responsible for the wereleopards in town, as if she doesn't have enough to do.Yes, she is now a vampire hunter/necromancer/vampire servant/female werewolf leader/wereleopard queen.She still has a fuzzy penguin, though."
1,Where's A Match?,"So far this book is the worst in the Anita Blake series (Blue Moon is a close second). Anita seems to be totally out of control (or crazy). I hope Hamilton returns to her earlier zombie/vampire plots. Anita Blake should leave the weres alone! She's not a shrink (or a vet either).Maybe she should be renamed ""Akita"" Blake."
2,Very Little Happens,"Coming off such a strong entry (Killing Dance), I was disappointed with this 7th book of the series. Is Laurell running out of ideas? Nothing really happens in the first 125 pages. I can only read so much pretentious bragging and threats made by the vampire council before I'm just not scared by them anymore... an neither, apparently, is Anita. Some sloppy editing and writing make this the worst in the series. For instance, Chapter 16 uses the word ""cool"" FIVE times in the first paragraph. Maybe Laurell should concentrate more on quality and focus less on cranking out her yearly deadline."
5,Must Read List,This series has been awesome. Laurell K Hamilton is a very talented writer! I love this entire series. Sad to see it end.
5,Classic Anita and crew,"Another great addition to this series, it's kinda of addicting after you read the first one you just can't seem to help but need to know what will happen next. Definitely a promising series."
4,great songs here,"If you listen close you can hear it a little bit. He is the nephew of Sam Cooke, and there are lots of great songs here done very well. Ballad of Leroy is one..."
4,A christmas jubilation of talent and style,An excellent array of musicians as well as music genre. Each song has a style of its own that makes this CD a steal. Of the 17 songs and incredible talents you're bound to be playing this CD over and over throughout the holiday season!
1,???????????,I could not follow this book. I guess I need to do more studying and come back to it later because it bored me out of my mind at the time I tried to go through it. It's on the shelf for a date well in the future unless I decide to sell it first.
4,A wonderful Western Romance...,"Yeah, that's what I said. Liz Ireland is truly one-of-a-kind! This is the first book I read by her and the book just pulls you in. The masculine Tyrone Saunders and the Head-strong Louise Livingston make a perfect pair in this delightful book that takes place in the tiny mining town of Noisy Swallow, California. The plot is perfect, the conversations funny and to the point, and the characters unforgettable! This is one I am keeping! No smut and nasty language, but pure, wholesome love...It's really great!"
4,"Hard to define, but don't let that put you off!","trip-hop, dub, trance, I don't know how to classify this album. But if you can appreciate any of these genres, you will like this album.Maybe it's best leaving it unclassified. A little bit of Leftfield, a little bit of ONU, and a touch Orb-ish. Whatever it is, you need a good set of speakers (headphones?) to enjoy this!"
4,A good read with some twists & a few life-pondering points,"This book is relatively short and an easy read. I enjoyed it immensely. It has some sad parts... but sad in a way that makes you feel kind of cleansed and refreshed at the end. It has a very surprising ending that is truly unusual. I'm looking forward to the sequel. A very good effort for someone's first book. As Siskel and Ebert used to say, ""two thumbs up!"" It also had some good advice about life in there also... about what is important to most people and what should be the most important. They are usually not the same thing."
5,I am not a book reader,"I do not love to read books. So, when I received this book, I was not super excited to read about it. But after I started reading, I finished it in only 3 different sittings, in less than 5 days. It is an easy and quick read.After reading it, it is hard to believe it was fiction. It seemed so real and not far off from real life situations.I cried and laughed. And made me realize how HAPPY I am to be a wife, mother and a friend. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
2,The Greatest Disappointment,"I picked this book up thinking it looked like a touching read. (I&#65533;m a sucker for sweet books with happy endings.) ""The Greatest Discovery,"" in my opinion, however, is best left undiscovered. At less than a hundred-fifty pages, the prose and pacing make it feel twice as long. I can deal with a plot-less story if the characters are interesting and well developed. Sadly, one never gets to know them at any depth. Okay, perhaps a terrific ending will make up for it. It turns out the ending is nothing more than a set-up for a second unwritten book. I hate being negative, it&#65533;s not my style, but I&#65533;d be less than truthful if I didn&#65533;t admit that ""The Greatest Discovery"" was nothing short of ""The Greatest Disappointment."""
5,great book,"this is an excellet book,, really enjoyed it. makes you want to travel to america just to have alook at all buildings."
2,"Good Title, shame about the text","After buying the book and reading it's excellent title you'll be sadly dissapointed to find the the ""design patterns"" contained are actually fluff for well known simple concepts. A classic example is ""Distrbuted Callback"". This describes in 6 pages what can be said in 2 words.... oneway void. The rest is sadly derivative."
1,Save your money,"I found this book to be worthless. I would almost never use any of the patterns he describes in a real world CORBA implementation. The only exception to this would be the dynamic attribute pattern, but I would only use that now that Objects-by-Value are available."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book with a lot of expectations, having read the Gamma book a few months earlier, and having got huge value from it. This book is certainly not in the same class. I also find the C based example code, and references to CORBA 1.1 somehow obsolete."
2,Gamma it ain't,"This isn't a bad book, especially if you're new to distributed computing, but I was a bit disappointed. Perhaps the title sets lofty expectations for the content.Those new to distributed computing will find it interesting. If you've been doing ""real"" ORB development many of these patterns will elicit a ""DUH!""I'm not sorry I bought it; it's been useful. I just wish I had expensed it."
4,Finally - the real utility of Patterns...,"I have to admit that I was at first set back by the very negative reviews here on Amazon before I started reading this book. But now I find that I am looking back to this book frequently and finding many excellent in-sights.I think Mowbray & Malveau may have touched a sore spot in the patterns-clique, but they are clearly smart fellows when it comes to CORBA. This book begins to demonstrate the true potential of patterns as a way to pass on codified wisdom - extending patterns to those who are outside of the ""Patterns Illuminatti"" or just too busy to participate in a PLoP.If you're doing CORBA work, just read it, you'll use it."
3,somewhat interesting,"It was okay. Nothing spectacular about it. Alot of people explaining what interracial marriage means to them, their friends and families. It is somewhat interesting."
4,Interracial Dating in America,"Very informative. I'll leave it to the reader's imagination. However, this documentary was very interesting. You should buy!!!"
4,Great for the price,"Plastic is a little flimsy, the pegs do not all fit the same, other than that does a great job for the price."
3,Missing Parts,"This product was exactly as you would expect a Plastic Test Tube Rack to be. I have no complaints except for one issue:The rack comes with assembly required, and it was missing two pieces, this means I can only dry 4 test tubes with my rack at a time, instead of the six."
3,"great idea but no ""how to"" insructions.","The book shows a very creative ideas for carving pumpkins for Halloween. However, the book lacks any directions for carving, how to get the seeds out when neccesary, and what materials to use for the eyes. For example, if you use candy for eyes, it melts. If you experiment long enough though, you can creat some wonderful faces."
4,Great book my Grandkids want to make them all,It's very gratifying to find the books that children as well as adults enjoy. We had a great time with the carving and it is true you never think to use the stem as a nose but also we use the other end and cut out the blossom end and insert a carrot to make a witch. Great book and full of ideas
3,"superficial, not an introduction for this programmer","I found this book very superficial and not much detailin its descriptions. As a ""real programmer (???)"", this bookis not what I want. It does not give the in-depth informationthat a ""real programmer"" would require, you might as wellgo read the original papers with all the confusing andobfuscating mathematics.This book does has one big plus, one of the appendices (almost50 pages) lists many, if not most, of the relevent patentsconcerning compression."
4,Incubus in tha making,"Recorded in tha earlier 90's when tha guys of Incubus were in their teens, Fungus Amoungus has a funkier, thrashier sound than their newer CD's with influences from bands like RHCP and Primus. While admittedly tha lyrics at times don't make much sense, they're more fun and lightweight and Brandon has a distinct singing style that can switch from slow and melodious to fast without employing tha use of grunts or screams. Fungus is alot different than Make Yourself, fans who like Stellar, Drive, and tha likes, might be dissapointed by this cd. I think that its an incredible effort from Incubus considering how young they were and tha fact that they released it themselves originally, and it shows the progression of their style as they grow and matured."
4,"Different, oh but still wonderful","This album is absolutely nothing like Science, nothing like morning view, nothing like make yourself, and nothing like clotm. Ya know what, the same could be said of any of those albums. Every Incubus album is something completely differet. Hard and fast on Make Yourself, Melodic on morning view, kinda screwy and melodic on science and very deep and melodic for clotm. You get something new everytime, if you really enjoy incubus youll find something to enjoy in all their albums. Sure, Fungus doesnt have the technical musical talent or vocal talent, but its intense and fun. Exactly what those guys wanted when they were 17, all about weed and shrooms and having fun. If thats the mood your in pickup fungus. If your in the mood for something more meaningful grab something after science. Anyways, Incubus always has something to offer, theres no reason to argue over which album is better."
3,Incubus,"This is pretty good for a band starting out. This album lets you understand Incubus much more than if you didn't have it. It's by far not their best album ever, but If you're an Incubus fan, it's a must have."
4,The early beginnings,"Everyone has to start somewhere right? No one can become amazing and popular overnight, it just doesn't happen. Anyway this CD contains the first recordings of Incubus when they were still in their teens, and to put it quite frankly they were talented right from the beginning. Although people that discovered Incubus after ""Drive"" became a hit might find this album to be really odd and different from the same Incubus they have heard the CD is still worth a spin, just to realize that everyone has to start somewhere. Those of you that have known who Incubus is since the days of ""Enjoy"" and ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" will definately appreciate such songs as ""Hilikus"" and ""You Will Be a Hot Dancer."" Although Incubus has change over the years it is still enjoyable to listen to the days when they were a mix of The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and the grunge bands of the time. Take the time to buy the CD, give it a spin, and then appreciate it in all its unknown glory."
4,"If it's Incubus, It rox!","This is a great album...back when they were more of the rap-rock and not the sing-a-long kinda songs. I just love this band so much and they music is so awesome! It's a mix of funk, rock, rap everything and its HOT! Best songs are Psychosilocybin, Hilikus, Medium and You will be a hot dancer."
4,great start,"Incubus is one of my favorite bands. They recorded this album when they were still in their teens. So if you are an Incubus fan and don't like it, try to understand, every band starts somewhere. They have come a long way since, and if you listen to this, and then listen to Make yourself, you will see what I mean. Their influences are obvious here: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus, Faith No More.The lyrics aren't always that serious, but they make the album fun to listen to. If you are a hardcore Incubus fan, I suggest you add this to your collection."
2,"Now that Incubus's new ""aclotm"" came out....","This is for people who are new to Incubus from their new album. Fungus Amongus is a classic in terms of change.. A Crow Left of the murder nearly a decade later is far more musically sound than Fungus Amongus. So if you are thinking about purchasing this album based on A Crow Left of the murder or Morning View i suggest you check out the incubus official site first to take a listen. Fungus Amongus is a very fun album to listen to. A lot like Primus or old Chili Pepper music but its just not fluent or well done. I recommend it because it, if in the right mood, is a real fun album. ""Take Me To your leader""is actually good. The rest are nice but only if in the mood to chill out and listen to some choppy funk rock. Id first buy SCIENCE which is well done and an awesome album. If you enjoy SCIENCE then go on and buy Fungus Amongus as well."
1,To Self Proclaimed Music Man 689.,"Wow. Someone took my review a little personally. Difference of oppinion is the fabric of America. Don't be so insecure, and please don't bore me with your personal oppinions about me. I just didn't happen to like the CD. Big deal. After reviewing your reviews, it's pretty obvious that you don't have a very diverse oppinion about anything, but that's o.k. You can look up diverse in the dictionary. 99% alternative. For the record, I did listen to it. Unlike yourself, I wasn't trying to be cool by dogging it. Just that comment tells me that you're young and immature. Don't take things so personally. What did you do, sleep with the band? Maybe you can discuss it at your next therapy appointment. Relax, you'll be o.k. and everything is fine."
1,HUGE Disappointment !,"This was a horrible follow up to ""Make Yourself"". Its sounds like it was thrown together to capitolize on their new found radio play. I am in the music business and listen to hundreds of CD's. This was one of the worst records of 2001."
3,If youre lookin for the Morning View or Make Yourself Incubus...,"move along... Think early RHCP meets Primus mates w/ early Korn... It doesnt suck, just not for me..."
5,Funk it up,"I am a diehard Incubus fan and Fungus Amongus (Fungus Among Us) as the root of all incubus is a sneak preview of how genious Incubus is and how smart they were about life as teenagers. The lyrics in fungus Amongus define what they are all about right now. If your heart and soul goes out to this band and you have an open mind you will see the beauty in the music as well as the lyrics, i think when Incubus say that they are somewhat disappointed in this album, it goes to show that they have learned QUITE a bit since then and are being modest about this all out CREATIVELY BOLD album. People that bash on this one need to listen to it with a different set of ears. Thanks, ENJOY!"
4,Old School Incubus!,"Far from today's well known Rock band, we can really tell what Incubus was like in their past. And I like it. A lot. The modern funk is a sound that i have never heard before. Songs like ""Hilikus"" just grab your attention from the beginning and never slow down at all. ""Sink beneath the lines"" has great 'harmony', I guess you could call it, it is nonetheless, catchy.My only knock on the CD is that its too short! And there's no other way to hear this kind of sound from them as they have emerged into a mainstream rock band [which is also a good sound- just nothing like this]"
4,The Kreachun of Incubus ;),"Yes, sadly enough people are still reviewing this CD. This CD is will only prove what I'm sure we have all suspected about Incubus. They had to start somewhere :P These guys had great ideas from the start. The problem I found with this ever so early music, is that it sounded like everyone was adding their own flavor to the band. The guitarist was doing his own funk thing, while the bassist was doing his whole jazz thing, and so on. This is why songs like ""Trouble in 421"" and, ""You will be a hot dancer"" stick out in my head. These were a couple of the songs where it seemed like the band came more together than others. And once that happens, Incubus becomes, Incubus."
5,"one word only describes this album.....""crazy""","""fungus amongus"" is a gem, its crazy, its pure, its amazing, its incubus! every incubus fan knows that with every record you can expect something new...but still have their sound/roots. ""fungus amongus"" has so many elements..jazz, metal, funk, rap, phsychadelic,...and add their own twist to it all and its just mind boggling. at first listen you will say to yourself..""what am i listening to?"". but when the cd's done you will say ""that was amazing!""..even though ""fungus amongus"" sounds like nothing you've ever heard of...you can sense major influences from primus, red hot chili peppers, faith no more. its so crazy to think that this band was just starting out...or in brandon boyd's terms..""finding their own ground"". you wouldn't imagine that they sound like they do today. brillant and crazy...words cannot describe this album."
2,for big-time incubus fans only,"I'm a fairly hardcore incubus fan, and if you're new to the band, don't get this album first. Get ANY of their other albums. This is all early stuff, and even Brandon Boyd (the lead singer) says on the CD jacket that this is pretty low quality music."
2,heard it didnt like it,i enjoy incubus they are a talented group but from hearing this it sounds like its written before they learned how to play there instruments properly.its way too intense even most metal heads would probably be a bit intimidated.fungus amoungus is an example of when something becomes so heavy its unlistenable.it sounds more like korn than incubus.in fact it reminds my of system of a downs debut (a much better album) just alot more intense and no real pause for melody ok theyve shown ability in creating something so intense and unlistenable but its just like people who want to go to see a guitarist who can play really fast for over an hour. i like incubus but all there other work is much better than this morning view make yourself science crow left of the murder this dosnt even compare to them i gave it to stars because the song shaft sounds like it could of been a filler of science and i like incubus but steer well clear.
2,Only nessicerry if your are an actuall fan,"Ok, I am a really huge Incubus fan. Seriously I am, but I can't see how people could ever rate this 5 stars. It's there demos from the age range of 15-17 years old, and you know that they are gonna have really bad production. Production is a main thing in a cd that is going to be good. If Incubus themselves intended this one to be good, they would have done something to it. If you are looking for an Incubus and want your moneys worth, get the greatest album ever ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" Fungus Amongus is really nessicerry if you are actually a fan of Incubus."
1,Please Stop,"I know it's tough to understand while you are browsing through the internet whether or not the music you see is quality. I am a big Incubus fan and was tricked into buying this album. It doesn't at all sound like the Incubus most people recognize. Their skills are admittedly great for a bunch of sixteen-year-olds, but that doesn't mean the music is acceptable by any standards. I can barely listen through two songs in a row. The songs are choppy, thrown together with a maximum of notes and beats, but no rhythm or structure whatsoever. PLEASE spend your money on something more worthwhile. This is trash. Brandon Boyd even admits that it is terrible inside the CD cover!"
2,nothing compared with their new stuff,"When I heard that Incubus had released a CD of their old music, i ran to the store imediately to buy it. I thought that it might not be as profesional as their newer works but still, it was Incubus so it couldn't be bad. When i put it in my cd player i thought that i had buyed the wrong CD! The style is completely different from their new rock alternative music. It is more reggae and slower then their new stuff. So if you like stellar, pardon me, and make yourself, this is deffinetely not the CD to buy. It has some good songs but overall it isn't worth your money."
2,This album is weak,This album is weak and hard to listen too. when you listen too it sounds like everything is all over the place and this album would be last on my list for recomendations. If you want to listen to true Incubus I suggest that you listen to Make yourself!
3,this is the album ive been avoiding but i dont know why.....,"i own a crow left of the murder, morning view, make yourself, and s.c.i.e.n.c.e. and science happens to be my favorite incubus cd, i like the funky bass and i think brandon is a great singer. i actually prefer there early work over there new work, because i think make yourself and morning view are pretty boring cds. however crow left of the murder was expectional. ive been a fan of incubus since 98, and since then i have grown alot of respect for them since i first started listening to them. i always tryed to avoid this cd but one day i was like ""hey i got some money why the hell not?"" i bought it and i became and even bigger fan than i was 7 years ago. i recommend buying all there cds you wont be disappointed."
4,"some truths, some things disagree with","I'm still processing what Henry Cloud says in this book. But I don't exactly agree with his approach to dating. First of all, there isn't much Biblical support for his ideas (and possibly also no Biblical support for mine since the Bible is pretty silent on the issue of dating or finding someone to marry). Yet, I really don't understand how his concept of dating is different from good friendships (which I have had many close friendships with women). As well, I just see some of his ideas as flawed (but with a nugget of wisdom). From personal experience, I would say never listen to him when he says that you can date a non-Christian! Yet, his book is good to read to just make you analyze what you do think about dating and finding a mate. I think most Christians are way off from what is healthy!"
3,take with a grain of salt,"This book has many good tips, but like anything it can be misunderstood depending on the perceptions of the reader. Don't be too quick to put it down just because it challenges you, but be aware that some of the challenges won't necessarily apply to you since we all have our psychological and emotional wounds that keep us from the freedom we need to rise to the challenges he presents. You might first need to work on healing those wounds. I'm no expert; just my opinion."
3,"SHORT, SWEET REVIEW","Wow, based on the many long winded reviews, Henry Cloud is not the only author or relationship expert! Here is the long and short my friends: Single and don't want to be? READ THE BOOK. Take what you like and discard what you don't. You will get something out of it. Later gator..."
5,Reading this made dating so much easier,"Such clear, direct and practical advice that significantly takes the pressure off dating. What a relief and pleasure it was to read and to lighten my attitude about dating, I so appreciate this book and imagine anyone who goes on a date with me now will be meeting a better person for it."
3,Once upon someone elses time,"This book has some good ideas but unless you are ready to totally go out of your comfort zone and try some different tacticts this book isn't for you. You have to rethink some of your ideas on dating and that is not a bad thing but his idea of date every thing and any thing because it is ""just a date"", is too out there for me. He want's you to put Dating for marriage out of your head but ultimately isn't that why we date? We all have standards (religous views) and I am not going to put them to the side ""just for a date"". I plan on being equally yolked and don't want to accidentally fall in love with the wrong yolk because it is ""just a date"""
2,Much ado About Very Little,"This book can be summarized as: go to new places, meet alot of new people, go out with anybody you meet, and you will eventually settle for someone to marry. He calles this ""getting your number up"" and it is the only theme in this very shallow, psycho techno babble heavy book. Under the pretense of being a ""coach"", the author explains why it is important to go to new places, to meet new people, and date anyone for the experience. Wrought with over analysis and jargon jibberish, the book explains the blantantly obvious to the truly clueless and hopeless."
5,The cover alone is worth the price!,"Excellent in-depth study of cat breeds, with just the information I needed to choose the right breed for me."
3,Mediocre photos,"I had previously bought Barron's Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds, and was looking forward to the same sort of large, high quality photos in the cat encyclopedia. Boy, was I disappointed! The photos are small (average size is 2 1/2 X 3 1/2). Some are murky or dark. Some are against poorly chosen backgrounds (e.g. a dark cat against a dark background). Some are mislabeled. (The largest photo of a Siamese is clearly NOT a Siamese.) And speaking of Siamese, they get so wrapped up in trying to show the difference between Traditional and Extreme that they never bother to show photos of all or even most of the colorpoints. (i.e. Sealpoint, Lilac Point, etc.) All in all, the photos are better in one of those $2.49 pamphlets that you buy at your local pet store!"
5,Good for the Veterinary Technician,I am a vet tech student and was currently taking Breed ID when I purchased this book. Wonderfully describes the personality and the car of each breed. A must for any library for research or the thirst for knowledge of cat breeds...
3,No basics,"I was disappointed with the book because it did not have enough basic bread recipes. If the book only had recipes for a few more basics (simple white, wheat, etc.), it would have been more useful. I like the 4 flour cup recipe sizes. A good book, but not exactly what I expected. I look forward to trying some of the specialty breads in this book."
2,All DVDs received scratched.,"Received a ""new"" DVD set and I am not pleased. The DVD box set is made cheaply and caused scratches on all discs data side where they come in contact with the cardboard material. One DVD had adhesive on the outer edge of the read side of the disc but the movie still plays. I like the majority of the movies but gave it a low rating due to condition of the DVDs received. Remember, this was a ""new"" set!"
1,If you liked Chaos - RUN AWAY FROM FASTER!,"Gleick's Chaos was a masterpiece. It was a book that applied science to reality, and did it interestingly.Faster is several hundred pages of complaints. He decries the speed of society on one page, and complains about how slow it is in others. He doesn't actually explain or educate like his other books. He just rants and whines, and expects the reader to enjoy it.It isn't worth it. Treasure that book you loved, and skip this one you won't."
2,A Newspaper Article Blown Into a Book,"This would have been fun to read at dinner or on a train - but too superficial to spend several evenings with the book. The book on the history of time by Landes, whom Gleick quotes, was much more serious, uniting technology and history. This one is too fast to be deep. The thing that pleased me about this book was that Gleick was being productive. Local papers reported that he suffered a terrible personal tragedy last year - it's great that he could work despite it. Well, thank you amazon for your generous return policy - this book is going back to you."
2,Time Waster,"I did read it all, cover to cover in about 3 hours, so it kept my attention, but when I was done, I realized I had just wasted three hours. There are lots of mildly interesting facts of no consequence whatsoever. There is no thesis - a big disappointment. I was looking for some kind of analysis or value judgment about whether the significant opportunities available by living faster are worth the sacrifice of thoughtfulness. Also, his phenomenology is weak. We don't press the ""door closed"" button because we can't stand to wait 5 more seconds, we do it because we resent being held against our will by the machine, and by the implied economic machine that provided it. We punch out of impotent frustration more than impatience. Gleick doesn't dig deeply into anything - a demonstration of the price you pay for going faster."
1,Quickly disappointing,"After having read Gleick's ""Genius"" and ""Chaos"", I expected much much more. This is a superficial, nearly pointless discussion of the cheapness and frantic pace of our lives...We all already know that! I guess the author just needed a few more bucks in his bank account. I have a background in physics and the study of time both on a physical and a social level, and a thorough education on societies, calendars, timekeeping and timepieces. None of these topics was very well discussed here. As a matter of fact, not much of anything was discussed very well here.. Superficial and pointless. I have the distinct impression that the title was taken from what the publisher must have kept telling the author during the book's writing. Don't buy this book. If you must, borrow it from a library, and spend as little ""time"" on it as possible."
2,Interesting Anecdotes,"However, I can't help but to feel that Gleick is in a state of extreme sarcasm or anger when he's writing this book. Taking potshots at the technology around him and making fun of advances that has made our lives a little bit better.Gleick has a knack of turning everyday occurances into scientific observations. He's like Dilbert doing science rather than office politics.Although I enjoyed Genius and Chaos, I can't say that his current writing hold its own. It's just too banal if you're working as an engineer or a scientist yourself.Since there's no such thing as 2.5 stars, i'll have to give him 2 stars"
2,In a word....SKIP!,I'm fairly sorry that I read this book. It's very little on science and a lot on philosophical ramblings. I wish he kept to a series of single points rather than throwing bucket loads of info at the reader and jumping around from sentence to sentence. I'm quite sure I won't remember much from this book.
1,"Fast, Run Away from this book","Catchy title, catchy subject. But the author does nothing other than identify and complain about a wide variety of time issues in life...very anecdotal. At the same time he is complaining, he chose to write in an MTV short snippet style that epitomizes the problem.The author complains that there are too many choices of mustard, so we even lose time trying to select the ""right"" one.In an earlier era, I think the author would complain about the automobile...does it really save time he would ask? Before you know it you have to stop and fill up with gas not to mention tune-ups and tire changes.At no time does he sit back and spend some time to reflect on the issue. He offers no new insights. Run do not walk AWAY from this book."
2,Disappointing,"This book describes how we want things done faster, and how things have gotten faster, but there are no real insights, or depth, or theories underlying this obvious assertion."
3,A rather glib Masters thesis,"An entertaining read, full of ""yep"" moments much just like those soc and psych textbooks of yore. Suitably apt to the book's core thesis is the fact that some of its anecdotes have become ""quaint"" so soon. Pick it up for a good afternoon's read, and not for the sort of stimulating newness so apparent in Gleick's title character of ""Genius"" or the pervasive philosophic depth he plumbs in ""Chaos."""
1,Bad. Never coalesces to a message and point.,"Sadly disappointing from the same author of the wonderful book -Chaos-. Why did Gleick release this abortion? What was he thinking? This book is nothing more than snippets of today's developed world nanosecond cadence. Unless you're not part of this society (or living in a Montana hut), it's not news. This book has absolutely no flow and reads as if it was just cut-and-paste together in a haphazard fashion re: examples w/o any intent to author's -MESSAGE-. Yeah, things are moving much faster. And will continue to be even more this way. ...So? We know this. What's the point? Good insight if you don't live in this impatient developed world (meaning especially the United States). Else, an embarrassment to, at other times, fantastic author Gleick."
1,Ridiculous,"Any book is an instant classic to Amazon if it's publisher can pay sufficent graft to their reviewers, Gleick is probably in the pay of multinational's, his science is ill founded, he has no understanding of thermodynamics."
3,Self-Fulfilling Prophecy,"I am the demo for this book. More commentary than analysis or forethought, the book is written in a way that propelled me through it at the expense of my productive work hours and sleep. Kinda like Chinese food- filling at the time, but strangely still hungry an hour later."
3,"""Faster"" ran out of steam","""Hurry Sickness"" and other fast-paced antedotes of our modern life are very thoughtfully and humoursly explained in this book. I recognized many of the symptoms described by the author in my own life. Unfortunately this book provides no cure for the disease and I quickly lost interest as the author failed to make any point or forcast any ultimate outcome. I tried to zoom ahead to the end but was discouraged to only find a good chunk of the book to be filled with acknowledgments vice any insight as to how we can control our fast lives. In the end I enjoyed the first half but ultimately I was left feeling ""yes, I know our life is hurried - what's your point?"""
3,"Good description of the modern condition, but not up to par","I enjoyed reading Faster very much, and it made me think about the way I live my life and why I do. It's a quick, fairly light read, with some great examples. But...It doesn't come close to Gleick's other books (or his NYTimes Magazine articles). Given his three books, it seems that the broader the stroke he attempts to make, the less insightful the analysis he writes -- and the less wonderment I feel.When he focussed on Feynman in Genius, I was enthralled and thrilled. Chaos was also wonderful, but diffused over a number of individuals. Faster is more diffuse yet with no concentration on individuals at all.Stick you your scientific, historical boigraphy, James. You are brilliant when you do."
5,An intense skate over the surface of modern time perception.,"I devoted some time I didn't have to reading this book all the way through (these days, I read the first few chapters and the last of most of the books I pick up). It's written fluently and clearly, but the succession of short chapters (which each address a facet of our modern free-fall into quickness)creates an effect not unlike the quick cuts of the modern commercial."
2,A quick read - good for commuting,"I was a bit disappointed not to see FASTER organized into discrete chapters. I guess this is indicative of the topic of the book--everyone is in a hurry. Don't expect any deep insights into quantum physics or science here. I read it on the train commuting to work. The short chapters have kernals of information that you can use when you want to impress someone at your next social event. I wouldn't buy the book, check it out of the library. Its faster that way."
5,"staggering, original, thought-provoking","Really amazing book. Looks easy and obvious and you laugh out loud sometimes but I feel it's really deeper than his classic book, Chaos. More subtle, more powerful. It stays with you. No cheap answers here."
3,Superman,My friend recommended this cd to me a week ago. Luckily i listened to his copy before going out and buying it. There are one or two okay songs but the best is defenatly Superman. That song's great. But most of the other stuff is garbage. I don't know how all those other people reviewing this cd could give it five stars! I would have given it two stars but Superman alone earned the extra star. I've got some advice listen to the cd before you rush out and buy it. If you want some good music buy a Less Than Jake albulm (Losing Streak is great).
2,No Good. Get their others first.,"The worst goldfinger album in my opinion. Maybe it's because i just don't like ska so much, but that doesn't change the fact that i dont even like the more punk songs on here. Superman is the only song here i would rate in goldfinger's 20 best songs. Any other goldfinger album is good, just steer away from this until you become a fan of the other ones first."
4,It's not time to hang up just yet!,This Goldfinger album is one of my favorites! I don't think it is quite as good as the first one but it does have that original Goldfinger style. I am still waitng out the arival of their new album. I definately hope their new album is as good as the first!
3,ska songs on here are good,"This is the only Goldfinger cd i like, the others sound WAY too much like Mest (although goldfinger was out first, mest is just better) I like the ska songs on here, i think they should be a ska band instead, it would fit the lead singers voice better. In the song ""i need to know"" he sounds a little bit like the singer in sublime in the beginning. ""superman"" is a really great ska song, i would get this cd just for that song. Other good songs are ""carlita"", ""20 cent goodbye"", and ""i need to know"". The only non-ska song i really like on here is ""authority"". But get this cd anyways if your a pop-punk fan, all the songs are pretty catchy"
5,Great Stuff,"I agree with the other reviews on this CD. There are a lot of great songs on it. But I can't believe that many people have over looked the song Carlita. This is a great song from it's fast paced beginning, to its slower feels, and then finally to the best part. The bari sax grove at the end with the Tenor sax solo. I believe that this is the song that makes the CD, but the rest of the CD is also very good."
3,First CD still the best,"Goldfinger kinda went too ska with this one. The first one was awesome, with Mabel, The City . . ., and Here in My Bedroom. This one is kind of a disappointment."
3,ska songs on here are good,"This is the only Goldfinger cd i like, the others sound WAY too much like Mest (although goldfinger was out first, mest is just better) I like the ska songs on here, i think they should be a ska band instead, it would fit the lead singers voice better. In the song ""i need to know"" he sounds a little bit like the singer in sublime in the beginning. ""superman"" is a really great ska song, i would get this cd just for that song. Other good songs are ""carlita"", ""20 cent goodbye"", ""lonely place"" and ""i need to know"". The only non-ska song i really like on here is ""authority"". But get this cd anyways if your a pop-punk fan, all the songs are pretty catchy"
3,it's a good cd.....but just a little unseteling,"when i used to own this cd. I thought it was great. i bought it again to hear some old favs. but, as i have gotten older and in to some diffren't styles of music. i figured out this cd just wasn't what it used to be. this band sounds like a manufactured punk album"
5,The best CD in '97,"Goldfinger,again proves that they are the masters of punk/ska/ with this great CD. In Hang-Ups, Goldfinger adds in some pop to make a great combination of music. You want variety? My friend listened to this CD, and after listening to the first song,Supernman,and the next one,My Head, he couldn't even tell it was the same band. In some songs, Goldfinger combines 2 or more of the types of music in the same song(ex: If Only,punk+pop, and,Carlita,ska and punk). Another plus about this album are the lyrics. Instead of just randomly ryhming words, they sing about relationships, and about the lead singer's(John Feldmen) childhood. This is a must have for any punk,ska,or pop fan!"
4,A Goldfinger Great,"This is an overall good cd. This one is more laid back and more mellow than their first album. The reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because of that hidden track. Comon, who wants to listen to nothing for 30 minutes, then about 5 seconds of a live track. But while there is music on the cd, its great. Out of their 3 albums this one has more ska. I would have to say that the best song is Cris Claton. That song is filled with energy and is catchy. Along with the rest of the album, there are great songs, then songs that arent that great."
5,Damn!,"This is without a doubt one of the best CDs I own. The best songs are probably Superman, Disorder, Authority, and Chris Cayton. The rest of them are great too. I think that you'd like this if you're into ska/punk stuff and like bands like Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, NOFX, and The Suicide Machines to name a few."
4,GOOD,"This is a really good cd i borrowed it from a friend. Don't expect ska and don't expect punk, because it's right in between. It's good"
3,Doesn't capture their Live Show,"Hang-Ups is a slightly disappointing follow-up to Goldfinger's fantastic first album, made even more of a let-down by the fact that all the new tracks kick live (then again, Goldfinger is one of the best live shows out there).If you only buy one, stick with the original."
4,Another Good CD!,"I do like ""Hang-Ups"" a lot, even though I think ""Goldfinger"" was better. ""Hang-Ups"" provides a mix of ska/pop/punk that you usually don't find...or mixed very well. If you love the first CD, you may be in for a little disapointment, but it's still great. To mix three different styles together and still produce one awesome CD is something to clap at."
2,"Walter who? This is a bootleg of Walter Wanderly's ""Brazil's Greatest Hits""","Yep, correct me if I'm wrong but compare the track listing. It's an exact digital copy!I bought this CD many years ago in LA and couldn't understand why there was no information on such a great artist. Thankfully with much research I was put right and discovered the great Walter Wanderly.Non-the less, the artwork on the CD and cover is awesome."
2,Tracking Stinks!,I agree with the other review that the faster you move your hand the faster and more responsive the pointer moves. For someone that does graphic arts or photography work this mouse does not cut it. I thought I could get a decent mouse under $20 ($16.95 at Best Buy) but that doesn't seem to be the case.
2,Very dodgy tracking.,"This mouse is extremely hard to get used to. There seems to be a threshold involved where if you move your mouse beyond a certain speed it suddenly is much more responsive - increasing the speed of your mouse does not smoothly increase the speed of your cursor. The speed of your cursor will suddenly become much faster. It's annoying as all get-out, and as a gamer, this mouse is next to worthless to me.One star is for functioning properly, the other is for the well-implemented forward/back browser buttons on the mouse."
5,Great History,"This book details the Tower of London so spectacularly that when I went to the Tower, I knew my way around and could have given a tour myself!! Lark Gilmer did an amazing job with the photography, and Kenneth Mears does a great job of detailing the intricacies of the Tower."
3,A sorta fun little book,"Well, the rating of this book really depends on if you enjoy sex games or not. Some people dont, and like to get right to the action, but some enjoy fantasy and role playing. If so this book is for you. There is a lot of that stuff in this book, from dressing up, to good props, that you can use on each other in fun ways. I am not a big role player myself, that is why I gave it only three stars. I was expecting this to be a book with more games that you can play in the way of strip and do what I ask games. If you are looking for that, then this book wont be for you."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"I hate to be blunt, but quite frankly, most of the ""games"" in this book will probably have occured to just about anyone with much experience with their partner. And if you and your partner are a new couple, just starting out, it's unlikely you've got the kind of trust built yet to sit down and go through the book together. I suppose one or two new ideas might get generated, but most of this stuff is fairly basic. Surprise your lover, take a bath together, gently tie him/her up, drink champagne, etc. etc. Also, if you're looking for anything explicit in the text, look further. It is quite tame. The photos are soft core and not terribly inspiring either."
3,Sex Games,"We thought this would be a fun addition to our sex life, but it really didn't offer any suggestions we don't already do. We gave it away as a gift."
5,Accounts of water milfoil growth don't get much better than this,"For all of you who are distracted from your daily routine as the thoughts and questions of the distribution, growth, and phosphorus relationships of water milfoil are running through your heads, look no further. Chagnon's account of this extraordinary plant after her extensive observation and research is unquestionably the most comprehensive of its kind. I would recommend this to anyone with a hunger to learn about one of the more captivating invasive plants common to the US, as well as those planning a vacation to Lake Winnipesaukee, NH. The content and superb writing style in this piece of literature will leave you far from disappointed."

5,an inspiration,this book made me cry. because the stories were so real and precious. and because i fall so short sometimes. it helped me see what really matters in life...and helped me overcome fears i had denied for years. Jesus used this book tremendously in my life and he can use it in yours.
1,Piece of outdated crap,"I have to blame Amazon for not putting any specific information about this product. Once received, you realize that it a) only works with Windows 95,98, and 2000, and b) the driver is on a floppy disk and NOT on the SMC website for download because the product can't be used anymore. Amazon's picture is too small to read the fine print, and nowhere does it mention the floppy disk.This is completely useless in today's world, do not buy this product."
3,Colors For Living,"While I was initially attracted to the basic concept, layout, and the presentation of the color schemes in this book, many of the actual interiors seem extremely dated. I think that the color swatches at the back of the book are a useful resource, but for actual interior design ideas there are other books on the market that I feel are far superior."
3,"So close, but not quite","This book starts out so well, and it ends so well, but in the middle, it seemed to lose something. He describes the feelings of falling in love impecibly, and uses pop culture like a master. The footnotes and random photos are very interesting also. But when Camilla leaves, so does anything good he had going, and the book just turns wierd. With an odd gay scene and other random embarrassing stories, it's very easy to lose interest and let resentment fester inside. The end of the book is very good, and you feel so proud for Curtis, but the middle is so wrong. This book was almost great."
2,"Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda...","This is an odd, and ultimately disappointing book. Fowler writes in three parts and each part gets worse. The first part, about falling in love, is good. He captures the longing of love quite well. The second part, after losing Camilla, quickly becomes a bad comic nightmare. The last part, seems out of left field even this Oprah-soaked age (I'm being vague here because I don't want to ruin the ending). Is this part satire? I have no idea. The book had it it's moments (great pop culture references at times). But, in the end, it seems a little (pun intended) creepy and odd."
2,pretentious and annoying,"I disliked this book intensely, though I do think Fowler has some talent. I found his prose overwritten, pretentious and annoying, and I too saw the footnotes as an unnecessary and unfunny gimmick. While I agree with another poster that the first section of the book captured the throes of young love well, the second part -- which deals with Curtis' emotional breakdown-- was completely ludicrous and not nearly as funny as he thought it was. I struggled mightily through the last section and had I not been stuck on a plane for 9 hours I never would have finished it. In addition, I found the climax completely out of left field, a shift in tone that made little sense and even somehow (made me mad).Had Fowler not tried so hard to show us how clever he is and kept his story grounded in reality, I think he would have had something special. But he tried way too hard and missed the mark.Nick Hornby? Not in Fowler's wildest dreams."
1,Not a Fun Read,"This book disappointed me. Based on the cover description, I thought it would be a light, fun read. It turned out to be anything but, and I had a difficult time finishing it. Although the writing is good, the story is really more pathetic than funny, and it has a few unsettling elements. The character of Curtis is not sympathetic; he comes across as insecure, undependable and untruthful. Rather than rooting for him and Camilla, I was hoping for her to dump him."
2,Out of the deep end,"The story is okay and the characters real if not entirely likeable; luckily it's an easy read. However, it's striving to be a deeper and more thought provoking novel than it has the ability to be and that is where the trouble lies. I'm not certain if the author is playing with the reader or if he really takes himself so seriously. The footnotes were a nice ""suprise"" when they voiced a ""note from Curtis"", but patronizing when not. This is a nice draft novel that an excellent editor could have made great."
4,A Beautiful Voice Definitely Worth A Listen,"A beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. I had never heard of Haley Westenra until I saw her in the Celtic Woman, A New Journey DVD. I liked her looks and loved her voice so I ""Googled"" her and started buying her albums, of which there are several, and her DVD. Hayley is from New Zealand and started her professional singing career very young. Since I have most of her albums, it is interesting to hear how her voice has matured over the years. Her voice is at it's best in this album which is one of her latest. If you like beautiful music, you'll like this CD ""Hayley Westenra."""
5,Cute stone,This is sooooo cute & it's quite heavy. This is a Christmas gift for my daughter & I know she will like it. Very impressed with the lettering & all over appearance of the stone.
4,Smarter than the weather man,"I gave this product to my sister for Christmas. She sent me a picture a few weeks later of the stone covered in snow. Her message was ""I'm glad you gave me this weather rock. The weather man said it was going to rain."" She loves it!"
4,An excellent library of chords and different voicings.,"The black book of Guitar chords is relatively small and portable. It's 269 pages of chord tabs and all the different voicings you may or may not desire. It includes power chords, slash chords, and a small section on transposing. If you seek any information on theory, this is not the book for you. It contains no information on theory. However, if you are looking for hundreds of different ways to play chords, the black book of guitar chords is wonderful."
2,Not a good as I had hoped,"I've used this product for a while and my big complaint is that it takes 3 capsules to equal 450 mg while other products from reliable vendors only require 1 capsule. While this may seem insignificant, I take a lot of supplements and the fewer the better and the caps are large. So at that rate I use up a bottle 3x faster and the costs are similar. This product isn't for me."
2,"Good fundamental info on V1, V2 is a waste","My husband and I watched the tape together. Volume 1 focuses on how to give pleasure to women and volume 2 is supposed to be how to give pleasure to men.We think Volume 1 provides good and detailed step-by-step info for beginners to find the G-spot. However, volume 2 is a waste and it only lasted for 10 minutes. Volume 2 could be summarized in 2 words: ""suck"" and ""swallow"". It really doesn't need to be a tape on it's own. We are very disappointed at volume 2. I was expecting it to give a little bit more information on the basic techniques and steps as volume 1 does (where do you start, how to proceed, the intensity, the movement etc. etc.).If the video is marketed as a tape on ""the basics of how to please a woman"", I'd give it a 4. But since it is supposed to provide techniques for both partners, the tape only delivers half of the value, I can only give it half the marks - 2."
3,Get New Sex Now Instead,"The first video was pretty informative. The second was pretty lame. It's true - ""suck and swallow"" was the message. In fact, suck a LOT - lol. One good thing from it tho was to ""let go"" and push yourself past your own personal edge bcuz you never know what could be ""on the other side"". The video for women was excellent in terms of demonstration and knowledge, but the guy is one of those types that get under your skin (he offers good info though). I'd recommend saving the extra and getting the ""New Sex Now"" video instead. Same concept, different setting and no cheesy 2nd video (I have both, didn't know they were the same). This video definitely enhanced the intimacy between my partner and I!"
1,taste......,"low sodium is really good if you use it to cook with, but if you are planning to make hot broth to eat/sip......not so good. the taste is yuck."
3,Good product okay price.,I thought this would make more servings than my usual Rapunzel low sodium cubes but it is not a better deal. Decent product though and easier to mix so I am using it with food storage.
5,great!,"I love this album! I have to admit I love all GUG albums and was even a little dissapointed when I saw there where only 6 songs on it, but I listened to it and was still very happy with my purchase. I recommend it along with all their other albums^u^"
4,Great read -- ready for the next book in the series!,"Although Bergren writes in a Christian context, this is by no means a trite ""message story."" The characters are deeply, richly written, frequently flawed and floundering. They (and the reader) are caught up in the circumstances of the story, each leading naturally to the next situation. In the end, the story is resolved, with enough questions and concern for the characters to invite the reader to move on to the next book. Believers and non-believers will easily become absorbed in the lives of Elsa, Peder and their friends and family.I rate books as follows:***** Fun and meaningful book, or changed/challenged me in a positive way.****Really fun or meaningful; well worth the time.***Pleasantly skimmed the surface; not memorable.**Plodded through.*Abandoned; very flawed."
4,"It's a great book about friendship, love and betrayal.",You would want to read this book!!! You won't be able to put it down! Keep it up Lisa!
4,"Great Series - (4,5 stars)",A Delightful read with an excellent plot and loving characters.I found myself completely entertained with this novel.
2,It gives a misguided view of Purgatory,"This book is scary. And according to current Church teaching, it's accuracy is debatable. Not that the events stated definitely did not occur, but they are not interpreted properly. Any of you familiar with EWTN's Fr. Groeschell know that he strongly dislikes this book. A more accurate description of Purgatory can be obtained from Catherine of Genoa. She relates a vision of Jesus standing at a doorway beckoning us to enter Heaven. However, if we are not ready, not perfectly cleansed, to stand before the throne of God, we do not approach. We will know when ""we are perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect."" Only then do we unite fully with God."
2,doesn't stand up,"I got this item as a gift for my baby shower and it's very cute, however, it won't stay on the high chair at all he suction cups do not hold it up."
5,"Koontz for Kids, and Adults Will Love it Too!","Santa has been tied up, stuffed into a sack and thrown into the basement of his house in Santa's Village, North Pole. His evil jealous twin brother has control of his sleigh and reindeer, is vandalising houses and switching toys for toad snot and other disgusting things, so that kids will hate his brother and live in fear each Christmas for centuries to come. It is up to two good girls named Charlotte and Emily to stop the evil one, rescue Santa and save ChristmasThis sensational rhyming, illustrated Christmas tale also has the added bonus of hidden snowmen on each page, Where's Wally? (Waldo, America) style. Obviously kids will enjoy this sensational thriller but so will adults. Also read Garry Larson's There's a Hair in My Dirt which is another children's classic written by an author who normally writes for adults."
1,Returned it - did not like,I thought this book was inappropriate for the age group specified and I returned it immediately. I am still awaiting credit for my prompt return. The book was not what I expected and had a very negative adult undertone to its messages and attitudes about the spirit of Christmas.
1,Too Grotesque!,"This book is certainly not for young children with its nasty graphics and language... putting slime and guts into Christmas presents is not what I want to teach my child. After I read it once, I literally THREW it away. Do not waste your money."
3,Not sure why I got this!,"For some reason, I didn't realize that this was more of a kids book, and I really never got around to reading it."
1,Not what I had hoped,"I purchased this book on the strength of its reviews. The illustrations are beautifully expressive and it would be fun for children to find the hidden surprise on each page. However, the story itself is long and has violent or mean-spirited overtones that I find incompatible with the spirit of Christmas. I chose not to read this book to my first grade class as I had hoped, but instead gave the book to an adult friend who is a fan of Mr. Koontz' other work."
4,bent up triangle,"I do recommend this novel, but only to those who will not desperately flee some miserably twisted circumstances. This novel continues the experimentation of the English novel as a form that Beckett put a halt to when he became French. Berg really is tremendously dark, but it has an oddity or eccentricity that makes it not only memorable but meaningful. In addition to the story indicated in the editorial reviews above, it does something to resemble in content an almost Graeco-tragedian structure puttied with a more domestically modern flesh. This novel is one that totally disturbed me in ways that did not make me love it but I find that the author is wonderfully comic, creative, pleasingly dark and intelligent. For such an odd book, I do not know how to say I recommend it, but for a continuance in one's education of novelistic recourses this may be one book that makes you happy in a rather uncomfortable way. If for no other reason, pick this novel up to read the first sentence."
2,fish feeders,"My fish will not eat off of these feeders. It's a good thing I tested them first. I bought alot of these too. Can you give me some reason other that what is already on your packaging as to why? Thanks for any help you might give. I purchased the beta feeders, the star feeders, the fish feeders also."
3,Nice Voice but a lounge singer,"Marilyn is talented, she can even scat some. but unfortunately I don't feel she is good enough to keep me entertained for the length of a CD, I have been listening to her as I write this to be fair.Entertainers work to hard to be panned unfairly. I am sorry but she is a pop singer trying to do jazz."
2,Okay,"Good book to pick and choose what is pertinent or useful to meet your students/child's individual needs.Not my favorite activity book - however I am still looking for a ""favorite"" word family activity book."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book for use in my 2nd grade class. I found that the pages did not have much variety. I ended up using the book ""Word Family Practice Pages (Write and Learn, Grades K-2)"" instead. My students seemed to like it better, maybe it was the crossword puzzles. Overall, the book just didn't work for me."
1,JUNK ALERT!,"THIS COMES WITH ONE DUCK ONLY. DUCK IS VERY CHEAPLY MADE, MINE CAME DEAD. BIG, BULKY, AND FLIMSY. CAN NOT REPLACE BATTERIES. TOUCH SENSOR IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT TURNS IT ON, ANYTHING THAT HITS IT WILL TURN IT ON WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY I RECEIVED IT DEAD. I'VE SEEN MUCH MUCH NICER LIGHT UP DUCKS IN A SET OF THREE AND FOUR WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING INSTEAD OF THIS BIG CLUNKY HUNKAJUNKA."
3,Only one duck!,"This is only one duck (not a set of 4). The item is poorly advertised. Mine worked at arrival but I thought the other 3 ducks were missing, but it's only 1 duck! If in fact they are selling you only 1 duck, they should at least give you the option to pick the color. I got a blue duck, maybe my niece would have preferred the pink one!!"
3,"These type of toys should be labeled ""DISPOSABLE"" !!!","sellers never mention of the fact that the batteries included in these type of sealed toys can never be replace even you try to cut off the glue sealed bottom, these batteries was designed to be caged forever within the lightning system. So once the batteries ran out, you can either use it without the light or to buy more. SELLER SHOULD MENTION THIS FACT IN THEIR ITEM'S DESCRIPTION. It just like buying a flash light but the batteries are NOT REPLACEABLE.ps: if you already bought any water related toys, make sure to put more glue over the manufacture's sealed glue area for double protection. Water did got in and destroyed 3 of my kid's ducks :-(."
5,A Must See for Everyone!!,"This is a film that should be shown in schools and homes across the world. It is very well put together and holds an important message for every human being. I don't know how anyone could watch this film and not have their life change forever. If there is one film you must own and share with anyone who will watch it, this is the one."
5,The Most Important Film Ever Made.,"If there was only one film I could make every human watch, it would be this one. This is the most monumental film I have ever seen."
4,Extrememly Graphic,"---Be forewarned, the images you see in this video will disturb you---It is quite eye opening as to the extent of disturbing practices we commit against animals on a daily basis in various industries. But also extremely graphic. Far more so than Food Inc.Unfortunately it comes with the agenda of turning people to Veganism.Because of this I would personally classify it a ""propaganda film"" instead of ""just a documentary"". But still worth watching."
5,Soul,"This CD for me is a must have for any collector. I adore Bertha Tillman, 'Oh My Angel' Jan bradley Mama didn't Lie and the Impressions Gypsy Woman. All soul classics. I highly recommend this disc."
5,Brilliant CD!,"This disc blew me away. Especially the Coleman and Schifrin pieces. The playing and sound of the recording are wonderful. Great musicians and great musical taste add up to a wonderful experience. Congratulations, this will be an award winner!"
5,"Saw a performance, the cd was just as good.",I saw her perform in Baltimore and she was really good. I was surprised to see such a large crowd for a baltimore club. So I bought the cd and it was just as good. The vocals are smooth and the lyrics are weighty.
1,Fraying Yarns,"It's always difficult for me to write a negative review for a disc like A Thousand Yarns especially when it's obvious that Dawn Dineen put an incredible amount of herself into the songs and their recordings. However when I find that my own notes on the disc are taken mainly from Dineen's bio and other technical information, it's clear that the record leaves little of an impact. Granted, the album is mixed well it's ashame she wasn't able to do more with the content as she wrote all but one of the songs and plays all guitars and bass on the disc. Dineen's mid-level vocal range is not as expressed as well as it could be despite her best Suzanne Vega impression on opening cut ""Fleer."" ""Ant Farm"" is fun while ""Devour"" sounds as if it was penned by Bjork. Sadly, A Thousand Yarns frays before you get to the edges."
1,Does not work,"Ordered this thinking that it was the ""right"" adapter for the mini ipod.. Nope, it doesn't work. Reconfigured it several ways through computer and outlet. Don't bother. Waste of money"
1,my experience buying ipod shuffles...,"my experrience buying the ipod shuffles was absoluely HORRIBLE....OH iHAD NO problems getting the accessories.........NO ipods and was even told by the company that they don't sell ipod shuffles IN SPITE OF THEM BEING ADVERTISED.............I have much experience buying online and feel lik.e I was duped . AND THIS CAME FROM AMAZON a totally trusted company. VERY,VERY SAD"
1,Does not work,This charger did not work. I have ordered bargaincell before and not had problems but this did not charge at all.
1,Wrong Charger,The description said it was for my little i-pod but it didn't fit and won't charge and I already threw away the packaging. Lame.
1,Bargaincell USB Hotsync & Charging Dock Cradle desktop Charger for Apple IPOD Shuffle 2nd Generation MP3 Player,"Money poorly spent, luckily it was not much, but I am sorry you have been waiting in vain, is useless, does not transmit load, much less linked to the pc, we will have to try your luck with other chargers."
3,question,i bought this and my mom has a 1st generation ipod shuffle i wanted to knw if this works for that too
1,does not work,I bought this to charge my apple shuffle and it does not work. It will not charge it nor will my computer even recognise it is attached. I have tried it on multiple computers as well
5,Ipod Dock,This Product is excelent and I would recommand this product to any who's is interested in buy one for your Ipod
1,part order,The ad states: Ipod Shuffle AND Cradle. They sent the Cradle only. I then Email requesting the Shuffle and they refused. I already have a Shuffle and wanted a 2nd one for twice the music.
1,Piece of Crap,"I plugged it in and nothing happened - no lighting up like some of the reviewers here reported. In fact, my computer told me there was an unrecognized device in a USB port. Guess what that unrecognized device was? I couldn't figure out how to get the computer to recognize it, but I figured if I put my Shuffle in, it would at least charge it. Nope! The orange light on my Shuffle came on for a few seconds and then went out. Nothing I can do makes the light come on again. So yep, you get what you pay for, unfortunately, and this item is a piece of crap. Avoid!!!"
1,killed my ipod ):,"I've used my ipod 5-6 times since I've had it. Got it last christmas (10 months ago). Anyway, after not using my ipod for about 4 months, i noticed a mouse chewed through the cord on the charger (the one that came with the ipod), so I ordered this one.I plugged it into the computer and first noticed the light in the charger, which looked pretty cool. I connected my ipod, and the light on my ipod lit up orange for a bit, but then went out. That was the last time I saw the light on my ipod ever turn on. Since then I've tried everything I can possibly think of to get it working again, but nothing is working. I think it's toasted :/"
1,Junk -- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,Unit I received is NOT what was pictured on Amazon. It's a real CHEAP POS that does not work at all. Rip off seller.
1,Doesn't Work,"I just hope it didn't fry my Shuffle like others are saying. Plugged it in, docked my Shuffle, Nothing......"
3,Bargaincell USB Hotsync & Charging Dock Cradle,"Nothing impressive, handmade model of the stand with connector port exposed. For my money it serve my needs and does the job right."
2,worked but was rusty on the usb plugin.,This item looked like a garage sale item. The ipod port was perfect but the other end has spots of rust and imperfections. Maybe it was stored improperly.
2,Hummmm,"I ordered this not knowing I would receive another one with the replacement of the shuffle. So, I really didn't need this at all....also, it is way to bulky!"
1,Don't Bother,"Wow, what a bad product. I'm amazed it made it to the marketplace. The charger doesn't include a wall adapter, and isn't designed so that you can see the charge indicator light on your iPod when it's attached. So of course, you have no idea if your iPod is actually charging. And guess what? It's not charging! Such a piece of junk. Don't bother."
1,Not what I expected,"This was the cheapest thing I have ever bought and granted it was priced cheap, it arrived and was not what I expected at all."
1,DECIEVED!!!,I was under the impression that I was to recieve an ipod with the the docking station and usb cord. After anxiously waiting for 5 days all I recieved was the docking station and usb cord. I reread the ad and still thought the same thing. Of course as always it's too good to be true. I should've known for a penny. Now I have 3 charging docking stations. Oh well.
1,Total Garbage,"IT NEVER WORKED. IT. NEVER. WORKED. WORKED, IT NEVER DID. Did I mention this thing never worked? Well, it didn't."
1,false advertising,i ordered the combo order but did not get the ipod. later a e mail frombargain cell said it did not include ipod. but it says so right on this page.glenda
1,IPOD Shuffle,I was so excited to get my IPOD shuffle but it does not work. I set everything up but nothing plays.
3,Not what I thought it was,"I thought it was going to be the actual MP3 player and not just the charger. I suppose it could have been my mistake of not reading the fine print, but the quality of the charger isn't very good either. However, it was sent to me very fast, and I'm sure it was at least worth a little more than the cost I paid for it.(10cents)"
3,X-Mas gift,Cheap and does the job! I am really happy i didn't spend $30 in the store for a name brand charger dock.
5,Perfect,The charger was an awesome price I got it in the exact time it specified and in good working condition. I am very happy with my order and will order again for sure thank you!!!
3,Good Product,"Charges and transfers to the Ipod with ease, but, will not charge from a wall outlet! This is ithe only downfall in this product. If your on the go as I am, this product must have a CPU to charge!"
5,Charging dock,Item arrived on time. Item was perfect fit for other items purchased! Was a great gift to give to someone.
1,It broke,"It broke with in the first week. Had to buy another one at Best Buy. After all was said and done, it wasn't worth the purchase."
5,It does what it's suppose to.,This charging dock is great. It does exactly what it's suppose to do. We are very pleased.I recommend it to anyone needing a charger.
1,it is not the right charger,the charger I got does not work with the ipod I bought. you can slide the ipod to the position it is suppose to be.
1,Arrived not usable.,"I thought it looked fine, but when it came it was a cheesy piece of plastic that did NOT charge my iPod and was just horrible. Plus when it came, it had no protecting wrapper or anything. It must have been damaged."
1,Didn't charge the IPod shuffle,This did not work. I connected into an electric charger. Let it charge. Did not work. I then tried to connect to my PC. The PC did nto recognize the device.
4,Good stuff,It is not a bad product for what it is. The only thing I do not like about it is that the Apple version has a gripped foot on the bottom which holds the charger in place and this one does not. But I still recommend it. It was much cheaper that the one from Apple.
2,Didn't work or charge my iPod,This Didn't charge my unit &#128553; I wouldn't waste my $$$ on this item. Wasted my money on the item.
2,looks weird,the product is pretty good but it feels like its a fake item. it does work but i wouldn't recommend this item right now.
1,"Total POC don't buy this ""Bargain-cell""","When 'frequently purchased with whatever you're buying' pops up, read the reviews -- this thing is a worthless POC as many others have stated .... better to save your $3 for a good cup of coffee and a donut at your favorite place!! They need to have a ""no star"" rating for things like these!!"
2,not what i wanted,the reason it doesn't work for me is that i expected one that plugs in the wall not a computer.i travel and do not have access to computer and the computer i use at dad's doesn't work...in the tower....how do i send it back wtihout huge postabe fee.z?marianne
1,Useless,"This item does NOT work with the 2nd gen ishuffle (I did not try it w/ any other gen). Won't be recognized to sync or charge. Seller requires buyer to pay for return postage...even though this item is absolutely useless. I'm sure they do fine on this cheap piece of plastic, since most of us will not waste the return postage money.I'm using Win 7 64 bit.Should have known better- too many 1 star reviews to ignore!!!"
1,Doesn't work!,We purchased the iPod charger and it doesn't even work... POS is what it is. Now I am just going to go get one from the apple store cause then I know it works. Don't buy from amazon.
1,garbage piece of equipment,purchased this because I lost the little cord to charge it. Didn't read the reviews and now I'm paying for it. Lights up but does NOT charge or allow you to sync your ipod shuffle. Don't buy this product
1,Healthy Start,"This product was delivered on time.I order two of these product and it did not work on my ipod shuffle. You are better off getting the apple charger it was cost you $20.00, but it was while worth it. Please make sure you get the correct product that you need."
1,Not as described in name or description,"This item came up as a ""Frequently Bought Together"" item and it is not compatible with the iPod 4th Generation. Considering that I often look at these recommendations, I am very disappointed. What is even more disappointing is that the Seller expects the ""Buyer"" to pay the return shipping. The Seller has since changed the ""name"" of the product to reflect that it is for ""IPOD Shuffle 2nd Generation"" when it originally was ""Bargaincell USB Hotsync & Charging Dock Cradle desktop Charger for Apple IPOD Shuffle"". I paid $3.75 with free shipping. The product is now $0.80 and shipping is now $2.95. Not worth it and I would give this product zero stars if I could."
1,wouldn't work for me,"When looking at IPOD shuffles, this item was listed as an accessory. I purchased a 4th generation IPOD shuffle and couldn't get my computer to recognize the IPOD when sitting on this. I tried another computer with the same result.Bargaincell USB Hotsync & Charging Dock Cradle desktop Charger for Apple IPOD Shuffle 2nd Generation MP3 Player"
1,Doesn't work,"Plugged it in and connected the shuffle to it and POOF nothing. It didn't link to itunes, charge ... nothing."
2,Waste my money,This product does not work good as described. I wish I order different item. Can I still return this product ?
1,bargains,Cheaply made have to really position device to get it to work. Was not satisfied with product. Does work but not well
1,Too bad!,"The dock sucks. Wouldn't charge even though it lights up. Basically useless. Don't bother it's a waste of money. Very disappointed,"
1,Not compatible with iPod Shuffle 4th Generation,"I bought this in a bundle with the newest iPod shuffle for my husband's birthday. While it's a nice concept, the shuffle doesn't fit the way it was intended, and it doesn't charge the iPod at all. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Cheap Garbage,Should have gone with the real deal on these docks. Pure junk. You get what you pay for I guess.
3,"Its good, Thank you",This product was in my price range and I liked the efficiency with which it was sent. Thank you.
4,WOW,First time useing my pod and this worked fine. I was a little worryed because of the other reveiws but this is everything i expected except the photo was different
1,"It is just the Dock, only the Dock, no IPOD included","It is only an after market Dock for your ipod! No ipod included!The picture is deceiving, The product description is incorrect, copy pasted from Apples website for the ipod. I was completely tricked into spending my money. Thought I was going to do my brother a favor and buy him an ipod.Shop Amazon.com haha yea right.How in the hell do you ask for your $2.00 back? I was an idiot and thought I could actually buy an ipod for $2 Duh!"
1,Buyer Beware! Does not sync with I-tunes,I ran over my original I-Pod shuffle charger with my home office chair so I ordered this product hoping for an inexpensive replacement. As stated by several other reviews the product I received is not the one pictured by the seller and I was unable to sync my shuffle with I-tunes. Don't waste your $2 on this product!
1,"DOESNT WORK, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR THE PLASTIC","I was suspicious based on the price, but tried it anyway. It's a total piece of crap that never charged by ishuffle. It wasn't a big deal since it was so cheap, but it was a total pain in the ass to waste my time waiting for it to arrive then futzing with it trying to make it charge the thing. Now I have another piece of junk plastic in my house that I have to get rid of, and another week or so before the next charger comes. In the meantime I can't use my ishuffle. How incredibly irritating."
3,"Cheap, works, bulky","This item works as a great dock for the iPod shuffle, but only the second gen. The dock is bulky and not very elegant looking. I would go with a sync cable:eForCity USB SYNC CABLE CHARGER Compatible With Apple iPod shuffle 2ND GEN 2and use the item docklessly as it is easier to maneuver. Dock does work but is just not visually appealing. Not bad for the price but this item:eForCity USB SYNC CABLE CHARGER Compatible With Apple iPod shuffle 2ND GEN 2is cheaper."
1,It didn't work,"I plugged my iShuffle into the dock. I plugged the dock into my computer. Nothing happened. No charge. No recognition on my macbook pro. I bought another charger from another company and it's working fine. This is a low cost item, so the price of returning it versus the price of buying it is a wash."
1,BROKEN,"This product did not work when I received it, while super cheap, I was hoping it would at least work for a short amount of time."
2,Eh,This Charger doesn't really work too well.. I think it only charges but does not let me sync onto my computer :(
1,Junk,Didn't work. I thought the price was too good to be true and it was. It was junk... you get what you pay for.
1,Forget about it.,Never got it to work. It now in the basket of misfit toys. It is not work purchasing and I wish Amazon would have some way of keeping crap like this off their website. I consider myself fairly intelligent and I could not get it to work.
1,Crap,"Doesn't work wasn't worth the money, not worth the cost of postage to return back for credit. Won't order this item again"
1,Didn't Work,"What more is there to say, it didn't work when and would cost more to ship back than it cost."
3,"for a few dollars more, why not get OEM by Apple?","I've bought (chinese) imports of these things in the past and sometimes they work... and other times they are useless paperweights. I love the post about one of these cheap docks killing a shuffle! Just be careful and better test it out on your friend's shuffle first ;) As others have said here, you get what you pay for!Apple Dock for iPod shuffle 2G (White)"
3,It good,This product was hard to find because of the mp3 was old but still work well. I would buy this again came very fast in mail great price too.
2,Not necessary,"I bought this thinking I needed it to charge the Ipod Shuffle but I didn't. The Ipod came with a cable for charging. The only difference with this is you have a holder for the Ipod to sit it. It was packaged poorly and came damaged and no packing slip inside the ""padded"" envelope it came in. Now I have to figure out how I can return it. Aaargh!"
1,Does not work!,The device didn't work at all. would not allow PC to communicate with I Pod . I recommend Buyer Beware.It is simply not worth returning. I got what I paid for this time.
3,not what i expected but great delivery time,The item wasnt exactly what i was expecting but it did in fact charge my ipod as i expected it to do...Shipping was excellent! Got it before the end of my given time!
4,Good product,"Nothing fancy. Just a replacement for the iPod shuffle (Older style). Works fine with no problems. Just plug it in and set your iPod shuffle on it. The computer does the rest. It does have a neat little blue light that glows when it is plugged in. That's about as fancy as it gets. It works, and that is all I cared about."
1,Ehh..,"It didn't work when I recieved it. Couldn't get it to no matter what I tried. It came in a plastic sheath that was unflattering. Looked cheap when I opened it, and performed even worse. The company did refund my money, but too little too late I'm afraid. The time spent waiting for it's arrival could've been spent buying one that did work out of the box. Do yourself a favor and hit up your local big-box retailer for stuff like this. It's worth paying a little more in the end for a quality product that works."
1,DOES NOT WORK,Does not work!! I plugged it in and charged my ipod all day and it had not charge!!! DON'T BUY!!!
1,Don't buy anything from these guys----don't find out the hard way,"I didn't by this product from BargainHELL, but I did get a 2 bluetooth devices that were bogus---NO RETURN policy on my items----real crappy customer service. Buyer, definitley beware."
1,A little disappointed,"I've had trouble with getting this to charge my iPod, I put the iPod on the dock then I have to squeeze it together to get it to start charging. Appears to be cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Not happy with item or dealing with RELIC,The watch did not look as nice as the picture. The delivery of the watch was very much later than the latest estimated delivery date. No follow up or follow through information from RELIC BUT Amazon.com DID keep me informed of RELIC not having shipped the item. I wrote to RELIC but never received a reply. I would not buy from RELIC in the future. 2 stars because the watch does work.
2,Let down,"I am hugely interested in the Teutoborg Forest debacle. I have read any book on the topic I can lay my hands on. For this reason,I bought ""Centurion"" with high expectations. However, just as in Turtledove's case (I am referring to his ""Give Me Back My Legions!""), the book turned out to be a disappointment. The battle occupies only a tiny fraction of the whole book. The story of Calvinia, the disgraced senator's daughter; the profile of the main character, Glauxus; and the episode of the bear-hunt are all beautifully rendered. The author knows how to develop suspence in his narrative and writes well (one minor mistake in the few Latin words used in the book: the Cenurion would refer to his adoptive daughter as ""filia mea"" not as ""filia meus""); had the story taken place in a different context I would have given it a three or four stars."
4,It's action and adventure and a good read,"I've been reading books similar to this one by Scarrow and Altimari and found Centurion:A Novel of Ancient Rome to be just as enjoyable. A previous reviewer seemed to think it was written with adolescents in mind, but I disagree. True...it is not exactly a Pressfield kind of novel, but I liked the story and all the twists and turns it took along the way. I can't say as I learned much more about the destruction of the three legions led by Varus in the Teutoburg Forest than I had gotten from a history book, but I wasn't looking for a history lesson anyway. I wanted to be entertained and that's exactly what this book did for me."
4,A good first book,"With one possible exception this book is basically 'airport fiction', or 'vacation reading'. It grips you from the start holds you in place and concludes in a satisfactory 'everybody good lives, everybody bad dies'manner. If you like early Stephen King or Bentley Little, you will love this book. The exception I refer to is that although this book is a thriller it does not rely on some ghoul of zombi to terrify the reader. Instead it gives the reader chills that only extremely graffic accounts of child abuse can deliver. These scenes gave this reader nightmares and got me to root for the title charactor. Abe Lincoln said once 'those who like that sort of thing will like it those who don't will not.' I will most likely seek out Blake's future works as well."
1,"Amateurish, Boring, Indulgent.","I just have to counteract the puffery below - the writing is laughably, throw-the-book-across-the-roomingly bad. The editor is asleep at the wheel, for example (no spoilers, I promise, this book comes pre-spoiled) - Page 12 - his parents car was found in the river the next day. Page 24 - same car is wrapped around a tree. Never mind examples - I'll be at it all day - heed the PW review and don't bother with this one."
4,An up-and-comer with a bright future,"Michael A. Black's second novel, Windy City Knights brings back kickboxing private detective Ron Shade (A Killing Frost) for another 10 rounds on the streets of Chicago.Shade connects one night with a girlfriend from his distant past, a chance encounter that sets in motion a sequence of events that jeopardizes both his safety and his hopes for the future. Instead of concentrating on his upcoming title fight, he probes deeper into the life of this woman with more than her share of troubles.Despite a lackluster beginning, Windy City Knights builds in suspense as the author unfurls his plot, nicely developing Shade's character. The characters are the strong part of the book, especially the relationships between Shade and the people in his life.Black may not quite be ready for a championship bout, but he's definitely an up-and-comer with a bright future."
4,Entertaining and Fun,"This is the second in the Ron Shade series of novels by former policeman and martial artist Michael Black. If you enjoy Robert B. Parkers Spenser series, you can't help but enjoy Black's work.Ron Shade is definitely a work in progress. Although an adult, this character often seems to make some juvenile decisions and the reader may occasionally have a tough time suspending his/her disbelief. Having said that, Black is definitely developing as a writer. His dialogue is excellent and his stories believable and light.This is an enjoyable detective novel made all the more real due to Black's real life descriptions of Chicago and the greater Chicago area."
5,High Quality Series,"I myself have never read this book, but i have read almost every other in the series and i am amazed at how well they are written"
5,A touching tribute to women and our special bonds,"From the moment I saw the cover I knew that ""Girlfriends"" would be a beautiful book to hold, peruse, read, and give as gifts to the women in my life whom I call my bosom buddies. The photography is stunning and evocative, the words reflective of what it means to be a female. Simple and solid, ""Girlfriends"" reminds us of how little it takes to anchor us in a commercialized world that suggests we need more."
2,Not what I expected...,"Perhaps I should have read the description a little more closely, but the dimensions on this book are approx 2""x 3""...not exactly the size of the gifts I had intended to present my girlfriends with for the coming holidays! Because I have seem this book for sale elsewhere in a full size ""coffee table"" style book, I assumed that this would be the same thing. Just want everyone to be aware of what they will be getting. I was more than disappointed."
1,what about the issues,americans need to look at each canidates history.....just because one runs for democratic or republican president does not mean he has the ability.........more americans should be independents and select presidents for their history not their party...........this is just another attack a party book.
3,not for small hands,"This is a perfectly serviceable key board. Plugs in and and works as it should. The curve and the size of some of the keys, however, make it not optimal for the small-handed, such as myself. I make more typos that usual, and I don't particularly feel any ergonomic/comfort advantage."
2,stay away,"Badly made,randomly types the same letter 500 times when you touch it with normal pressure"
3,I wish it had no numeric keypad,"I mostly like this keyboard. Unlike other ergo keyboards, it does not have some funky alien layout and it is nice and thin, which means it sit below my fingers. The arrow keys are in their own T cluster and the media controls are useful.The only thing I don't like is the numeric pad. I could easily live without it, and then the mouse could be nearer to the keys I use, so I would not have to reach so far. This reaching is what is causing my shoulder problems. For this reason, I would recommend it for a left-handed mouse user, but not someone who is right-handed.Does anyone know of a keyboard that is like this (gentle curve, low profile) but missing the numeric pad?"
3,Good Keyboard Bad Design,Overall the keyboard is functional but the layout is extremely uncomfortable. Also the keys are not the most responsive and are not sensitive.
1,Defunct ( key,"I am a developer and use the keyboard quite a bit. Bought this keyboard for lack of space at my desk. Within 3 months, the ( key has stopped working. Opened up the key, air-cleaned it, poked around with a pencil, but the key is plain dead. This keyboard does not last!"
1,A really trashy keyboard,"This is really a pretty trashy keyboard.Certain keys on the one I own stopped working after lessthan a month of light use.I had owned a different Microsoft ergonomic keyboardwhich I was delighted with and gave me years of service.This one is different and cheap, avoid it.I managed to take it apart and get the bad keys working,but who knows how often that will be necessary.Do yourself a favor, spend some extra money and get adifferent model."
1,Not for Business use!,"EPIC FAIL! Cheap disposable keyboard. This is a nice little keyboard. It has a soft feel and is cheap. Unfortunately it is one of the worst buying decisions my company has made. We have purchased 30-40 of these keyboards bundled with mice. Over the last 3 months I have had to replace 8-10 of them because the Enter key will break; same key, different users. It starts with the user complaining that the key is sticking. Then it stops working. I pop the key out and find that the post is broken. I expect over the course of the next year I will end up replacing the rest of the keyboards. They may be fine for home use, but if you are buying them for a business you may want to purchase twice as many as you think you will need."
2,awesome keyboard but....,"i love this keyboard. i love the feel. i love the convenient calculator button. however, there is a problem with the keyboard. sometimes some keys wouldn't work. i thought this was just a defect so i decided to buy another since it is inexpensive. after another few months of usage I got the same problem with the new keyboard. some keys wouldn't work. two keyboards with the same problem makes me not want to buy another. i am trying to look into the warranty at the moment. but i don't think i'll be able to do anything since i don't have the receipt. i'd pass on this keyboard until they work out all the kinks."
3,"Worked well for 2 years, then the keys started to not work.","This was a great keyboard until a few months ago when the keys started going one after another. I guess I can't complain too much, but I think products should last for more than 2 years before you have to buy a new one..."
1,Crtain lttrs ar no longr working on this kyboard. VRY ANNOYING.,"I will say that this kyboard workd wll up until this yar, and I bought it in 2009. I rly it for hom offic work and for my graduat studis. It's clarly impossibl to complt work whn crtain kys ar dysfunctional. Right now it's only th lttr btwn W and R, but this clarly looks lik a problm that many othrs ar xprincing. It's obviously trribly annoying, sinc th lttr that dosn't work is on that is usd frquntly in many words! It's too bad. Back to Amazon to buy a nw kyboard, and to typ a rviw of how disappointd I am with th long trm prformanc of this kyboard. Buyr bwar!"
1,'letter after M ad before O' key stopped workig o my keyboard!,"Yes I'm typig this from that very keyboard... cause it is all I got right ow.Do you kow how ofte you use the ' ' key whe you type?Hopefully this is givig you a idea of how fu this is't!Seriously, the curve keyboard worked flawlessly for ie (that's 9 with out a ' ') ad ow it is pretty useless :(I took the key off the keyboard to see if there was simply juk i there, but that was't the issue...So buyer beware - the reliability of this product may leave you ' '-less"
1,How to fix broken or non-working keys on this keyboard,"This popular keyboard is famous for having keys suddenly stop working, work intermittently or different keys work at intermittent times. Try this: hold the keyboard securely by hand from one corner and give it a good smack the back of it with the other. I found this remedy out on the web, tried it and got mine working again. The three I own break so often I started keeping the boxes to return them but maybe we now have a solution to avoid returning them every year. I like & use this keyboard everyday but gave it one star so folks could find this ""fix"" hint easily."
2,dead keys after less than a year,"Dead keys after less than a year. The two letters between x and b. I can't even type them in this reiew (see?!?!). I had thought that Mirosoft (there it is again) made good keyboards, but it seems I was wrong. Aoid at all osts."
4,Comfort Curve 2000 and the Mac mini,"I am currently using this keyboard on my Mac mini (Intel-based). You can download the latest Intellitype software which is a Universal binary. The keys are programmable using the software (which appears in System Preferences).The feel of the keyboard is soft to the touch. The curved design does help in making typing easier (there's less strain on the wrists).So far, this keyboard is worth it for less than $20. It works with the Mac mini too."
5,Softest and quietest keyboard money can buy,"I have been using this keyboard for about three weeks now and let me tell you, this is the softest most comfortable keyboard I have ever used. At work I use the Microsoft Natural Keyboard which is more ""ergonomic"" but it is loud and bulky. This keyboard is thin, lightweight, USB connected, and DEAD silent. When I say silent, I mean this keyboard is QUIET. The keys press softly. I highly recommend this keyboard."
3,"comfy, but keys stop working over time","I bought this keyboard almost two years ago and have loved it. Just recently the letter B stopped working and the down arrow key. Just all of a sudden, no particular reason that I can think of. I thought it was just a fluke and I tried reinstalling drivers, changing the usb port etc... I didn't realize that this was actually a common issue with this model until I returned here looking for another one. I guess I won't get the same model this time, instead I think I'll get the Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000."
4,I'm loving it.,This keyboard is a little bit thinner than I thought it was going to be. I still love it though. The keys are quiet and it has the caps lock notification light that a lot of wireless keyboards don't have. Plus I love all the hot keys on it. It's all around great.
3,High End Price / Quality,"It is an ok keyboard that has some minor flaws. If you like to work inclined keyboard do not buy it. Design is ok but it is not helping because the curvature is small. It is a slow keyboard that you can not press more than 2-3 buttons at the same time which is needed in couple of games. Thus, gamers do not buy it. While you are writing you feel cheap plastic. However, overall it is better than most of the cheap keyboards with limited multimedia options. It is perfect for net surfers and office use."
1,Updated review,"I originally gave this 5 stars, but now the same thing has happened to my keyboard as other reviewers have had happen to theirs...a couple of the keys just quit working. Cleaned it out and still not working.I love ergonomic keyboards, but this one didn't last nearly long enough."
5,Very Smooth,This keybourd is smooth. Quiet as you type on the keys . Also I like the idea you have control of your volume when listening to music or videos. Well worth the price!
3,This is my second MS Comfort Keyboard. Didn't last. :(,"I had my first MS Comfort Keyboard for a loooong while, and just recently replaced it when my first finally stopped functioning correctly. I have no complaints whatsoever about the original one I had... but the replacement that I ordered was fine for only two weeks and then just stopped working altogether. :( For the price, it's an awesome keyboard as far as the great design and comfort. It's sooo easy to get spoiled on the convenient layout of the keys... but I'm disappointed that this last one I ordered died so quickly. It wasn't dropped, or abused in any way. Just stopped working altogether. Not even the lights would come on when it was connected to the USB port. As much as I love the keyboard itself, $18.99 shouldn't mean disposable."
5,Wire connect keyboard,I had recently purchased the wireless mouse and keyboard and the keyboard just stopped working. I went back to the usb port connect and this one is working fine. I like the key touch pad and the response time is great.
4,Great price and great tactile feel,"I love how this keyboard feels. The keys have a very satisfying click but there is little resistance and you never feel like it is fighting you. The keys are perfectly laid out in a standard format, but some keys are abnormally sized to accommodate the curve. I have used natural keyboards for a long time due to wrist pain and Microsoft has continually made the most comfortable units. The curve is just right to allow for fast typing while not sacrificing ergonomics.I've purchased two units for less than $20 on sale, and you just can't find a better keyboard for even twice that price. At first I thought it could use a few more secondary controls, but I have reprogrammed the ones on the keyboard to suit my needs and no longer feel that would be necessary.This is a great keyboard well worth the money. If they discontinue production I might go so far as to stockpile a few for future use."
2,Key action feels... weird,"This keyboard has a good shape, and good layout, but the key action feels weird and, it's hard to say... ""squeaky""... there is no squeak per-se, but the action isn't liquid smooth. The action has almost a high frequency scrape that makes the nerves in my fingertips recoil in discomfort.I really don't like typing on this keyboard, so for the first time ever, I'm going to replace my keyboard before it's actually worn out."
1,Broke after a few days,After a few days of purchasing this keyboard and using it mainly for my PS2. It would freeze up and prevent me from typing or moving. I would have to unplug the keyboard from my ps2 and plug it back in. And it would do it a few more times during the day.
2,one of my important keys stopped working,"Just before writing this reiew i was returning a rieter that broke while testing its ery first riet. It was a terrible pain to write that return and a reiew for it without the letter """". I had to paste all of the letters """" by right clicking. I would normally use ctrl+ , but that was not an option at the time. Howeer, it is worth noting that this keyboard was great for the first two years and seeral months that i had it. But it only saw ery light use. I decided to replace this defunct Comfort Cure 2000 with a Comfort Cure 3000. I really enjoyed the cured design of this keyboard, but it broke far to soon in a ery frustrating way. (The ""Esc"" also broke at the same time.)"
2,Where's the A again?,"After less than a year of use the keyboard lettering wore off. Still works otherwise ok after 2 yrs. Oh and the B,N,M keys stop working every so often until you drop the keyboard on the desk."
2,Worked great... for a while...,"So the keyboard is one of my favorites. So much in fact that I bought two of them, one for my desktop at home, and one for my workstation at work.Unfortunately, both in the past few weeks have started to ""lose"" keys or require that they be pressed for an inordinate amount of time to actually communicate with the controller in the keyboard to recognize :-/"
1,"owned two, both started to fail after 1 yr","I don't usually write reviews, but as I type this up, my second comfort curve keyboard is failing. This time its keys 'zxc'. I opened it up to see if I could notice something with just a cursory examination, and its nothing obvious to me. These keyboards have a great profile, but plan on buying 1 a year if you do."
1,The Comfort Curve 2000 just doesn't hold up,"I don't know what's up with Microsoft these days but their ergonomic keyboards simply don't last. I've had one Comfort Curve 4000 and two 2000s and all of them have failed --- some of the keys become unresponsive. This is a shame because I prefer an ergonomic keyboard (I had one of Microsoft's first, back in the 90s), but this is too much.I just received a Logitech 300 from Amazon. Not ergonomic but a joy to type on. We'll see how long it holds up, but I've never had a Logitech keyboard fail."
5,"Disposable keyboard, but worth it anyway","My comments will likely echo other reviewers:Pro:The ergonomic design of this keyboard is excellent (layout, keystroke feel, and texture.)The media player and calculator hotbutton keys are nice and I used them more than expected.USB interface instead of the obsolete PS-2 connector.Quiet unlike many cheap keyboards.Relatively thin which helps with wrist positioning and strain.Con:The ""b"" key stopped working after 13 months. Others have reported this same problem on this and other review sites. To me the keyboard should be more durable, but it is not. However, if I consider that I can get one year of use out of a great keyboard for less than $20, then I really can't complain. This keyboard is a good value for the investment required.Despite the durability issue, I am now on my third keyboard because it is that good."
4,Just like the one it is replacing,"I liked the one I had. But, alas, It developed problems, so I chose to replace it. I didn't need any new features, so I am pleased."
4,decent,"Bought this to use at work.. This Curve keyboard 2000 is a decent, slightly ergonomic keyboard. The keys have a decent feel, and the browser keys, multimedia keys, and calculator key is great. As others have reported, the spacebar is a bit off.. and does make a louder than normal clacking sound.. but it's nothing to get worked up about. It's definitely not a ""make or break"" point (unless you're very.... ""sensitive"".. aka whiny)."
4,Easier to type.,"This keyboard makes it easier for me to type, because the keyes are not in a single straight line. The curve actually is more like the natural way my hands lay on the keyboard."
2,Letters on keys wear off,"I love the design of the keyboard and find it very easy to use. And, of course, the price is amazing. However, over a number of months (maybe a year?) some of the letters on the keys wore off. This is very frustrating to my wife who has to look at the keys to type. I have v1.0, so maybe later versions have dealt with this problem, but for $20 or less I doubt it. I decided to replace the keyboard, and just moved up to a higher price range (expecting higher quality) and a different brand (Logitech)via Amazon."
4,excellent for price,"I bought this for work. I was using the ""basic"" dell keyboard but use the wireless comfort keyboard at home. Using two different keyboards was causing me to make errors, so I bought this for work to aleviate this. The change was surprisingly effective. I recommend for anyone looking for an inexpensive 'quality' keyboard."
1,Stopped working within a few months,"The reviewers who've mentioned how these things break easily are right. Despite the reviews stating this, I purchased one since I'm not particularly rough with my keyboards. In fact, my last keyboard lasted for a decade before the letters wore off so badly that I decided to get a replacement.This keyboard broke within a few months. Some of the keys just stopped responding. More than one key. This is the kind of cheap junk keyboard that's designed to break immediately to force you to get another cheap junk replacement from Microsoft. Stay away! Buy something with a little quality!"
1,Keyb0ard d0esnt w0rk,"I'm using this keyb0ard and as y0u can see the letter ""0"" d0esnt w0rk. I'm using the zer0 because it's the cl0sest letter. N0t 0nly the letter ""0"" but many 0thers d0esnt w0rk!characters ""f"" "","" ""5"" ""0"" are als0 n0t w0rking. Im c0py/pasting these characters."
3,Nice Keyboard,"This is a very nice keyboard with an ergonomic feel. I'm a game designer and 3D artist so I work at the computer often. The keyboard is super thin and light weight. The button placement is pretty well thought out. It has all the necessary short cut keys and was easy to set up. I really don't have any complaints so far. I got this for Christmas and will probably continue using it until I upgrade my rig. I'm sure there are other keyboards out there with more bells, whistles, and light displays but this one does what it should. For that reason I rated it as average but don't look at that as a bad thing."
4,nice keyboard!,I like this keyboard now. It will take some time(4-6 days in my case) to get used to this curved keyboard if you never used a curved keyboard before. It easy to type on and well made. The functional keys are also helpful.
4,"Fine keyboard, gently ergonomic","SUMMARY:We have come to prefer wired keyboards, and this one so far is our favorite. I like that it is a little ergonomic friendly, too. It has some of the angle/split keyboard ergonomic benefits without the split being tremendous.The cord could use another 2-3 feet for those with big desks and computers on the side due to folder drawers.I'd like to see an even higher end version of this with longer cord, coffee shop quiet quality keys, and yet stays small and has the same mostly non-reflective matte style surface."
3,Great if your looking for quiet.,"The keys are very quiet. Almost too quiet. At times it is a little hard to type if you are used to a traditional ""click, click"" keyboard. Overall though a great buy and I'll purchase one again if needed."
3,Only average,"Pros: Attractive appearance. Useful convenience keys. Excellent oversized spacebar. The moderate arc makes it easy to transition between this and conventional rectangular layouts. Inexpensive.Cons: Seems well-constructed overall, but only a modest step-up in quality from OEM keyboards shipped with most new computers. Key switches have soft feel with little tactile feedback. Maximum keyboard tilt is less than most. For styling reasons the bottom row of keys become progressively smaller toward the right side in order to visually align with the arrow keys and number pad. This asymmetry unfortunately results in an undersized right CTRL key."
2,"Nice keyboard at great price, but doesn't last","I thought this keyboard was excellent and a steal at $15. But after 6 months or so several keys stopped working (colon/semicolon + some keypad keys) despite only light use and no spills. I took it apart once just to look, didn't really do anything but magically the keys started working again. Unfortunately within 2 days they stopped working again though. Apparently I'm far from the only one experiencing failed keys. The quality just isn't there. Can't recommend it."
2,Dead keys after 1 year,"Like so many others, some of my keys died after a year or two. Namely, the left control and left shift. Too bad because I think the feel is great. Don't give your money to Microsoft for something built so cheaply. They shouldn't profit from a product like this."
5,Love my comfort curve,I don't think MS still makes this keyboard but I love mine and it wore out after 5 years.. so I got this one.. I will buy one to save for backup asap.
1,Quality problem,I was satisfied with this keyboard for about three months until the 'n' key stopped working. I see I am not the only person who has run into this type of problem problem.
1,Fun while all the keys worked,"Since then, I have lost the B key as well as the left and down arrow. Used a total of 10 or 11 times, and packed away the rest of the time. Did not keep receipt - this is my first keyboard that ever broke.Otherwise it feels a it cheap, ergonomic form is nice though and not too drastic, so it's easy to switch with my normal one at work."
2,Both the cord and the lifespan are too short.,"I had this keyboard in my closet for about 2 years as a backup before I started using it. It was a backup because the cord is much shorter than any keyboard I've ever seen. You won't have a problem if you keep your cpu on your desk. But I keep mine below the desk and the keyboard didn't come close to reaching.Even before I put it away, I was concerned about the quality. The right shift key seemed to have been made poorly b/c it was much louder and had a different pitch than the other keys. So when I typed it sounded like ""tap tap tap TAP tap tap tap TAP tap....""But I won't be doing much typing with this keyboard anymore. I started using it and two keys went dead after less than 6 months of light use.The price is good and the halfway approach on the ergonomic keyboard is great. Typing and key response felt nice while it lasted. The quality is unfortunately lacking."
4,"Keyboard is amazing, Seller has terrible customer service",As everyone says this keyboard is awesome. My work uses these as well. My main gripe is with the seller. My keyboard 'x' key stopped working after 3 months. I tried to contact the seller through Amazon asking to return the item because it was defective. All I received was an email from Amazon saying the seller rejected my return.
2,ok,"It was cheap at the walmart i bought, right after previous Logitech G15 was submerged in soda(few times before I was able to save it). So i went and bought this one.It was difficult to get used to, since it curved and keys have different size! Its often still i would press wrong button after having it for a few months. Its sertanly not a gaming keyboard since it takes too much force to press buttons and to hold them down, my fingers get tired playing FPS games. My computer is being used by some one else at times, so person not familiar with this keyboard have very tough times typing!This why i give it 2 stars, keys are hard, and layout is difficult to learn."
4,Good quality for the price,"Lightweight but sturdy. Not as extreme as an ergonomic keyboard, but is quite comfortable nonetheless. The touch is more than acceptable. The extra buttons (volume, back & forward, etc.) are a nice feature. The spacing between the keys could be a little larger."
5,Awesome keyboard!!,"I have had this keyboard for about a month now and I really like it.It doesn't require any installation, it has media buttons that work fine.Very comfortable, the feeling is grade, it is also very well designed."
2,keys stopped working,"Loved this keyboard for about three months, until the ""n"" and the ""u"" stopped working, very frustrating. BF has same keyboard and loves it, no problems. Get what you pay for, I suppose?"
4,Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000,"It is a very nice keyboard. I am using it a work. I like the special buttons for Web/Home, Search, and Mail. There is also a calculator button which is really nice. The keys are really smooth and plungers for the keys are very soft, which seems to aid me in typing faster. The only thing I can complain about is that the cord is too short."
1,Return key breaks down after 4 months,Yes it is comfortable designed but the return key stopped to work after 4 months even though i had not used it that much at all.
4,Cheap but yeah it works :),"a small shift is annoying but nice design, pretty cheap but everything is working for me hope it will stay this ;)"
2,SHORT LIFE,"Love the ergonomic design and the shortcuts at the top but the letters ""e,l,k,and d"" wore off in just a couple of months. And a few months after that the ""c"" and ""v"" stopped working. Disappointing."
2,Didn't like it,"The keys are too thin/shallow. There is not enough tilt to the keyboard. The key action didn't feel right to me. One key stuck and I had to pry it up manually.A few keys were loose in the box when I got it, and I had to reconnect them manually.Go with the Microsoft Natural keyboard instead."
2,I returned item in exchange for a logtech k350 wave keyboard,I returned the Microsoft comfort keyboard in exchange for a Logitech K350 wave. Much better key board.
1,This Keybaord Don't work for me,All the other reviews prasied how great this keyboard was.. It was useless and unusable for me.. Waste of my money and will stick with normal designed keyboards from now on..
3,Quiet but impossible too get used to.,I bought this keyboard with the understanding that I had to force my self to get used to typing on it. After 2_1/2 weeks with it I gave up. My fingers just could not find the right buttons and I spent way too much time re-typing. Very nice keyboard beyond that. Quiet and good feeling to type on. Mine did have one other problem. The bottom of the keyboard was not perfectly flat so when I typed on one end the other end bounced off the desk. I feel that could really get annoying.
3,Good and bad,"I've bought several of these over my computing lifetime because I trash keyboards and these are cheap. They're great when they work, and very bad when they don't. My most recent keyboard lasted all of a few days, and they're just not worth returning for a new one. I've decided to buy a better quality from now on, but this model might do as a cheapie backup to have on hand for emergencies or the rough-housing user in your life. There's a nice feel to the hand placement and good action in the keys."
5,No complaints,"Works great, isn't loud (""clack clack clack"" by the keys), the comfort curve is good for my husband with his long arms - he says when he types on typical straight keyboards, he feels like a T-Rex trying to type."
4,"Quiet, low travel distance keys, but not for PS2.","I like laptop-style keyboards (quiet, low key travel distance), and this one works well for that. It is quiet and I can fly over the keys with ease.I was disappointed to learn that it doesn't do PS2 connections and won't work with my PS2-based KVM switch. I've had to give the keyboard to my wife, but I like visiting it.The one other thing I've missed with this keyboard is a ""sleep"" key so I can easily put our XP tower to sleep. Despite that, I'm glad to have replaced the stock HP keyboard with this one, and so is the wife."
4,Great Deal,"for the price you can not go wrong. My family loves this keyboard, it is a multimedia keyboard. The key have a quality feel to them. Nice keyboard for the price."
5,Buy It New and Be Gentle,"I just received this keyboard from Amazon. It seems to be working just fine for me.I would recommend that anyone in the market for a budget ergonomic keyboard visit Amazon often and try to find this item in stock and on sale or with free shipping.I was extremely fortunate to see Amazon had this on sale (14.98) and with free shipping, so it's a low risk, potentially high reward investment for me. Most of the standard non-ergonomic keyboards are the same price as this one. This is an immediate upgrade over those old dinosaur keyboards that have stiff keys and give you carpal tunnel syndrome. There are some vendors on the internet that sell this model, and other keyboards, in refurbished condition. I personally believe that keyboards (from budget models to expensive ones) are too sensitive to buy them refurbished or off of a retail shelf. Good luck to anyone who does that, but you might find yourself writing a one star review."
4,"Great price, but utterly standard.","I can't get too excited about this- sure it beats my prior KB, but it isn't something you're going to shout from the rooftops about. This is just going to tide me over until Xmas when I'll probably get something more for gaming. As it stands, just a fine budget keyboard.P.S: I use this same keyboard at work and some of the keys died on it just a day after this one arrived in the mail for my home use. Not a good omen."
3,Keyboard has some ghosting,"This is a very nice keyboard and works well for me except that it has some ghosting. If you're not familiar with what ghosting is, here is a website that describes what ghosting is:[...]If you're a programmer like me and want to remap the Caps Lock key, then keys like CapsLock-N will not work! Perhaps there are other modifiers that don't work together as well.This guy has also had some experiences with key failure with this keyboard.[...]For normal typing usage, this keyboard may be fine."
1,"Very comfortable, but lack in quality!","I'm having mixed review about this keyboard, I would give it 5 stars for the design and comfort, BUT zero star for the poor quality.I got this keyboard as a birthday gift in March. Not long after I started using it, about 2-3 weeks later, this keyboard started acting up, keys 4,6 wouldn't work. Now, after 2 months keys 5 and O don't work. So sad!! I love this keyboard with its handy calculator and volume buttons, very very comfortable for touch typing, but unreliable quality. If Logitech has a similar product I would buy it in a heartbeat.UPDATE:After two months of using this keyboard, more keys stopped working. I finally gave up and got myselfLogitech K350 2.4Ghz Wireless Keyboard. I'm happy with my Logitech keyboard so far."
1,A disaster,I purchased this keyboard a couple of weeks ago and began using it immediately. Shortly thereafter I began experiencing difficulty in accessing the internet. My computer went into the shop 3 times where it would work fine however when at home it would attempt to access the internet up to 90 times and then run out of memory and crash. Finally a trip to my home by the tech person discovered the new keyboard was bad (sticking key). This caused me considerable aggravation and ultimately a 100 dollar house call charge. I plan on contacting amazon to get a refund and compensation for the extra expense.
1,Waste of money,"I bought this keyboard couple of months ago and it worked nicely for 2 months but soon after, it stopped working. I have to reboot my system every time to make it work again and as soon as I hit ""Ctrl"" key or turn the caps lock on, it stops working again. Please don't buy this item, its sheer waste of time and money..."
4,"Sticky issues, but still not bad","As mentioned by some reviewers, some keys became stuck after a period of time. I had the ""h"" and the ""s"" keys stuck. In fact, the ""h"" key was stuck twice and caused me some grief with a password ;) However, I slam on the keys a couple of times and they went back to normal. It is cheap and fairly durable and I still use it at work. If there were no sticky keys then I would have considered this a ""perfect"" keyboard for the price. Although, I am ready to go back to the full-on ergo MS keyboard. I've been using ergo keyboards for more than 15 years and it is hard to go back to a regular keyboard (granted this keyboard is semi-ergo). It is still a fairly quiet keyboard and I can easily type at an average rate of over 60wpm w/o errors (over 100 with errors!)."
3,Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard,"OK keyboard. But didn't like the pasted on letterings on each keypad. Probably will come off eventually over time. Otherwise, the click and feel is fine. OK for the price."
1,Bed service from microsoft,"I bout this keyboard to replace my old Dell original ,when I try to connect it I didn't found adapter for PS2 port to USB(keyboard), I used adapter from my old one and when computer start to load programs it send me message ""Keyboard failed"". I call Microsoft and ask only for keyboard adapter, they sent me the same keyboard and now I have two of them with out adapters. I don't have time to send this back, probably it will wait for new computer with USB port"
2,"Comfortable keyboard, but....USB?","I bought this keyboard without thinking to check if it had a PS/2 connector. I have four powered USB ports on my computer, and they're all taken! I shuffled things around, unplugged a couple of things, and managed to find a temporary home for it...but it's going to cost me far more than the $15 I paid for the keyboard, as I'm going to have to go buy a powered USB hub because of this purchase.At the very least, a USB to PS/2 converter would have been seriously appreciated.However, if you do have a free powered USB port, this is a really nice, basic keyboard. Not *quite* clicky enough for my tastes, but that's a personal preference."
5,Great Keyboard!,A really great keyboard for just a little money. Great layout with just the right amount of curve to take the stress off of your hands. A terrific buy!
2,great design but much too fragile,"The return key is broken -- again. Much as I like the subtly curved design and the widening keys, the power shortcut keys, they're of no use to me when it repetedly breaks down. Were it not for breaking down, 5 stars. As it is, design promopts me to give a grudging two."
5,great keyboard at a great price,"I'm very content with this, I bought it for my job because the keyboards there are ancient. My wrists, and hands are already starting to feel better."
2,"the b, m, and n keys stopped working","it worked great for a while but then the keys stopped working for some reason, however the keyboard is very comfortable to use, just don't save up your money for this."
1,This keyboard has problems. STAY AWAY,"As stated in other 1 star ratings before, various keys have stopped working on my microsoft keyboard and it's well under a year since I brought it. The keys that stopped working are - the letters n, m, b, the number zero on the number pad, the comma and semicolon, cap locks, and all arrow keys. This is very frustrating because I didn't know what was going on at first since I've never had a problem with a keyboard. Not able to purchase a new one right away, I struggled with composing even a simple reply to an email. I resorted to opening up previously written documents with these letters, etc. in them and copy pasting them into whatever I was working on. As you can imagine, this gets tired REAL quick. Bottom line, there's obviously some kind of weird defect in this keyboard. Save your money and STAY AWAY."
1,Stopped working,"Alternate on again, off again keys ZXCV and ENTER. Very disappointed. Too many others with same problem, avoid this cheap model"
1,I should always check with Amazon first!!,"I made the mistake of buying this keyboard at Office Depot instead of checking with Amazon first. First of all I paid $19.99 for my keyboard, almost twice the price of Amazon. Second of all, right out of the box, the ""C"" button doesn't work. Office Depot is replacing it free of charge, but after reading a lot of the reviews here I wish I had bought something else! It seems obvious that a lot of people are having certain keys conk out at some point."
2,A ery nice keyboard,"At first I thought it was great. I loe the calculator button and the size of the keyboard. But then after about a year, the * key stopped working. That's the key between c and b. I gae it 2 stars instead of one because, really, how often do you need the key? I just tend to substitute words like adore for loe and really for ery, purple for iolet, etc. The main pain is cut and paste. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+ ...that alone knocks it down to 2 stars. I'e learned my lesson with this one and will hope for a better outcome with another brand."
1,Terrible Keyboard,"Do not get this keyboard! It is very uncomfortable to type on, and is cheap right out of the box. The keys are weird and make typing for a long time a hassle. Some keys are bigger than others! I would definitely not recommend this Keyboard to someone that has a Media PC like an HP dv6. Every single button at the top will not work. Its built so cheaply that when you pick it up you can actually feel it about to snap in your hand.I can't run out of bad things to say about this keyboard! Do Yourself a favor and do NOT purchase it."
1,Avoid,"Got this keyboard a few months ago. Overall, the keys and curve are appealing however, some keys just stop functioning. I've read online that it has something to do with static that builds up on the circuit or something which I could care less about. This should have been tested, and that's what quality control is for. It's useless when keys stop working, and really annoying when one moment it was working fine and in the middle of your email, the ""C"" key stops working or the right shift stops working.Save yourself the trouble."
1,Piece of junk!,What use is a keyboard where the keys don't type the letter? I won't even take it to Goodwill- why make someone else frustrated.
3,Ok for the price,I like the feel and design of this keyboard. It currently doesn't work on my laptop until I am in Windows. I do have the bios setup for USB support but still nothing. A ps2/usb adapter doesn't help the situation. I have not tried it on another PC so not sure if it is specific to my Dell laptop or not.
2,Good Keyboard BUT.....,"I have had a problem since I got this keyboard a year or so ago. Sometimes I have to unplug it and plug it in several times until the computer recognizes the device. Today, I have plugged and unplugged it 100 times and cannot get the computer to recognize it (I have it attached to a notebook via a port replicator). This is annoying and i find myself shopping for another keyboard which is an annoying hassle. : |"
2,Lightweight and flimsy! Avoid this keyboard,"Well, right out of the box I was impressed. It was light and typed fairly nicely, but after a few weeks keys started getting stuck or just not working at all.Now, after a few months, the shift key sticks or doesn't work every other time. Also, a few keys have just totally gone dead and you have to bang them down to make it work again. I'm not a heavy typer or anything, and am not usually prone to banging on my keyboards, so it's not something I did to it.At any rate, go for another keyboard and save yourself the trouble."
4,Good Value Priced Keyboard,"I was using a wireless comfort keyboard. I did not like it because from time to time it would lag and sometimes cut out all together. I decided I wanted a wired keyboard (I did not seem to have these issues with the mouse, and prefer a wireless mouse) and this seemed to fit the bill. It has the same overall design as the wireless keyboard I was using so it fit me nicely.Overall it seems sturdy, the keys don't make a lot of noise except for the space bar. the keys on the bottom row are nicely angled down, so they are easily pressed. The added keys are nice, although there are fewer extra keys then my previous wireless, but I never used them all. The added keys I use the most, volume and calculator, are in good easy to use places.I would recommend this keyboard for anyone looking for a comfortable value priced keyboard."
3,"Comfortable for basic use, but not worth price",bought this for temporary use and find myself still using it. The curve is nice in that i can type comfortably while still having arms on armrests. The keyboard is very light and does move around a bit especially when used for gaming. It has resisted a spill but just a minor one. The calculator key works nice along with the driver which downloads automatically through windows update/driver search. this keyboard has served its purpose but for the price i probably would not have bought if i knew the final result.Pros:curvespill resistantcalc keybig keys but still comfortable due to curveCons:lightweightThin keyslittle responsepricey for a basic keyboardside note: will be updating to mechanical keyboard rather soon
2,Not the best typing experience,The keys are shallow and do not provide good feedback. I often find myself fat fingering keys. Due to this I probably use the backspace key more than any other key.Appears to be durable and fairly good quality otherwise. I've been using it about a year daily for work and it has held up well. I really miss the old clickity-clack keyboards (loud but I probably typed twice as fast on those).I recommend going with another keyboard. One that has better key feedback.
5,Excellent Keyboard for MAC,"After installing the supporting software provided by Microsoft, this keyboard can be perfect on MAC OS! All the function keys can be self-assigned to varied hot-key."
4,Good Value Keyboard,"The slightly curved design works well. It is comfortable to use, is quiet and the special keys especially the volume controls and calculator make it a winner."
4,Good quality for the price.,"I'm sure there are better, ""premium"" keyboards out there, but I think this is a great keyboard for the price."
2,Nice keyboard for as long as it works,"I was very happy with the comfort and performance of this keyboard, until the enter key stopped working. Don't remember exactly how long it lasted, but I'd say about a year or so. Maybe that's not unreasonable for the price, but it's certainly inconvenient."
5,Psychology of Small Groups,"Cloud & Townsend hit yet another home run! They show you how to transform a group from gossip groups, & groups that are just full of information, to creating a group where the atmosphere is ripe for transformation! If small groups matter to you, buy this book!"
4,I like this book,It has some minor printing errors but the book is nice...It has very few examples. I would recommend it for theory purpose only.
5,It's a wonderful reading and a great guide to get started!,I not only discover that Tarot it's a fascinating topic to read about but also I found myself buying a set of cards and started practicing this magic discipline.The great thing I discovered during the process is that it can be very enlighting about oneself and strongly therapeutic!
5,Classic Country: Great Duets,This is one of the best I've heard if you like country & duets... Absolutely wonderful!
3,Barely Readable,"The font size in this book is only 1 millimeter. Seriously the letters are all 1mm tall, which makes the book generally unreadable. Its almost a waste of money."
3,good for practical guidelines in map drawings,Quite useful for students who need to keep something before them for map drawings.... Excellent index Lacks in explaining certain small but imp. facts.
4,Real life of an artistic community,"For someone interested in the 1st. quarter of the past century's artistic and creative environment in Paris - this is a book not to be missed. In spite it's novelistic approach, it resembles the life almost every artist, painter, writer, etc. lived in those days.I have a special interest, in the development of artistic evolution - particularly painting - of those days, and reading this book gave me an overall insight of what the 'bohemian' life was exposed to - and intelectually/socially influenced by, rather than a merely account of their somewhat called 'eccentric' lifes.As an avid reader in the matter, I could also mention ""Women of the Left Bank"", ""Bohemians in Paris"", ""Bohemians of the Latin Quarter"", ""Kiki's Paris: Artists and Lovers 1900-30"", and books written by Gertrude Stein, to broaden the perspective of the early twentieth century's artistic generation."
2,Just didn't care for the ending,"An ok movie, not as good as the previous.Could take it or leave.. The cast changed and I just didn't find myself drawn to plot."
3,It was good,"I didn't read the book, so I can't compare the two. As a movie I thought it was a little confusing. It was still nice to watch a clean movie."
4,See the movie & skip buying the DVD,"I loved the movie! Lots of action, heart-felt emotion from the Steed family and early Latter-day Saints. I've read all 9 books in the series and of course it's rare a movie does justice to books. But the screenplay chosen here takes a decent shot and leaves me eagerly anticipating the third movie.HOWEVER - what is up with the DVD? The fact that there is no 'scene selection' (amongst other glaring omissions) is the worst customer satisfaction experience I have ever had buying a movie. It's terrible! Vineyard Distribution take note - you failed miserably and people are not going to be happy with their home copy."
4,Good Experience,"I was going to rate this five stars but my more objective side said, ""Naw, four.""I liked this movie better than the first -- it tweeked up the action and the dramatization (a little more `Hollywoodish').A Special Note: This is FICTIONAL history, although it does to a greater than lesser extent follow actual historical events. Hence, do not expect this to be accurate to a fault; just enjoy it for what it is -- enjoyable and entertaining so much so that I await the next installment.P.S.: It's great to be able to discover a better than mediocre action, drama type movie without excessive violence, offensive sex scenes and language. For this, at least, it deserves my support."
3,Great Movie - Horrible DVD FEATURES,"Actually, if you are a fan of the Gerald Lund Work and the Glory books you'll love the movie. They did change a few things in the movie but overall I felt it followed the books about as closely as you can expect.My problem is not with the movie but with the DVD itself. We spent nearly $22 to buy this movie and we take it home hoping not only to enjoy the movie but a plethora of features as well. When we turned the DVD on you will find that the STINKING CHEAP SKATES who produced the DVD give you only two options on the DVD menu, play movie and setup. How cheap is that? The company that produced the DVD, were too weasly to even put in a chapter selection feature. There were no behind the scene stuff, outtakes or anything.YOU MIGHT AS WELL PURCHASE A VHS VERSION.... IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING!!!"
1,Pretty lame,"I bought this because it was on sale for $15-$20 or something back when it was listed at like $60 (man did I get screwed!) It's kinda fun to fly around and stuff for a little bit, but the fighting is pretty lame. The way the whole game was set up seemed pretty lame. I didn't play it for more than maybe an hour or two. I wonder if Gamestop would give me $1 for it on a trade, that would be a good deal. I'm not a fan of GTA and I've never played the Spider Man games, so maybe it's fun if you are a sandbox gamer looking for a cheap fix."
3,Good gamerscore source!,This is exactly what you would expect from a movie tie-in; weak story and choppy gameplay.The achievements are easy (you can pick up 650 easy) which I like.If you like superman or free-roam style game then you should like this game.I payed $10 which is good for this game but much beyond that is poor value.Overall 7.0
2,It's not worth the money or the broken controllers,"THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE! This game has nothing to do with The Superman Returns Movie accept for the voice overs. It just an annoying copy of Spiderman 2, which was the original free raoming(sandbox) videogame. The bosses and enemies are tedious and annoying. The Combos are way to complicated and you have a health meter, which is stupid because Superman is invincible. The bosses are way to hard and this game had a small budget. The Graphics are terrible and this game will freeze your 360 badly. I returned it got another disc and that disc was defective too. Instead of Superman, buy Marvel Ultimate Alliance."
2,Another slapdash loser from the folks at EA,"Repetitive combat in a bland world, based loosely on the same-named movie of not so great acclaim. Makes me want to use terms like Herky-Jerky and Willy-Nilly when referring to the design concepts, despite my not being 80 years old (and really not knowing what those terms mean). Targeting system is the stuff of nightmares, and the camera is often jammed into a corner or up its own cache. All in all, a sloppy and lackluster game with some pointless fluff, which can be just as easily enjoyed from the demo."
1,Stay Away,"Too much money, it carries the name of the movie, however has absolutely no content from the movie excepts 5 minutes worth of game clips. Non-interactive. You fight the same enemies over and over again. Side missions are impossible when you are constantly dragged into fights with crappy enemies. Combos are not the easiest or most reliable. Find someone who bought it give them 2 bucks and borrow it for the 5 hours worth of gameplay."
3,Had High Expectations,It isn't awful and the graphics are great. I had higher expectations for this game. The Spiderman games are great and that's more what I was expecting with this. Perhaps if I started with no expectations I wouldn't have felt slightly disappointed. But it's still a good game.
2,"GREAT HYPE, NO SHOW","First of all this game was supposed to be released back in June, it's the reason I bought the 360. In this game the only time I felt like superman was when I was flying. They created this large city and you never even use it.All the fights take place in local areas. OH and in the fights yeah you never feel like superman,you get your butt handed to you by some robots immune to your powers or some mutants immune to your powers.How hard is it to understand that superman is the baddest of the good.If you must play this game ,which i understand, either rent it, or buy it at Rhino so you can trade it back for a desent game.Anyone else could take this game and have a blockbuster in 8 months ,its all there.errrrrrrrrr"
2,SuperMeh.,"For a IP with so much available backstory you would think that this would be a sandbox style game with the flair and fun of one of the Spiderman games. That incorrect. The grey muted palette, half wit story lines and laughable combo system turns this game into yet another lame movie tie in. Another buck to be made of kids and unknowing gamers.Save yourself the money and rent or trade. This is not worth 60$. It is not worth the expenditure of energy to unwrap it."
5,Great,Bought it for a friend and he loves it. It was delivered on time/ earlier than expected. the disc works great.
3,MY REVEIW (HEHE),"Thank you very much. I really enjoy this game very much! The reason I got it is because I couldn't play it on my PS2 because it doesn't work anymore. So, I decided to see if it was available for the 360. AND IT WAS! 2 thumbs up for it being available. The graphics aren't that bad, not as good as other 360 games but is manageable. However, overall the best superman game in my opinion. If anyone is a fan of superman and has X-BOX 360 or PS2 (still), you should get this and will not be disappointed. What i really enjoyed about the game is how fast he flies across metropolis. DAMN I WISH I COULD DO THAT! LOL! ENJOY!"
2,Save your cash.,"Flying is the ONLY pull of this game. Besides the awesome flight and superspeeding, the rest of the game is a repetitive mash of robots and dragons...save your money, and buy Spider-Man 2 for Xbox...or Gears of War for 360, those deserve your cash."
5,New Interest in History!,"I never enjoyed history classes in school, because I wanted to understand WHY events happened more so than when and where. Sarah Burn's ""The Daughters of Juno, Chronicle I Matilda of Argyll"" has renewed my interest in the history of the early settlement of the United States, the religious termoil in Europe, and the living conditions of that era.Sarah has done a wonderful job bringing out the personality of the the characters, describing historical events, and weaving the characters into that history, giving the reader a true flavor why those events happened.The romance and drama amoung the characters makes this book a ""page turner"" and draws you right into their lives. Sarah's obvious knowledge and background in teaching and studying the history of women is quite evident.Congratulations on an excellent novel."
2,Not what they advertise,"This is two different packages: one includes ~20 very small finger holds, and then another includes ~10 foot holds. They look different: the first package are painted like the picture, and the second are all grey. Clearly the second package was dumped into a plastic bag and included in the box.Buyer Beware of this vendor!"
1,Spoiled nutmegs,"I believe these nutmegs might have been either harvested and/or packed in an airtight bag while wet or damp and as a result, have moulded.I will toss them (and what a shame that is) since I can't find a way to save them.The mould is through the surface to the inside by half (thus far).I no longer have the box or paperwork to return.Any help would be welcome.Thx,Barbara"
1,Very blurry photos and video,My daughter bought this camera and found that it took very blurry video and the photos were blurry as well. There does not appear to be any autofocus as you would find on a digital camera and the flash photos appear to leave the subject washed out and looking blue. About the only good pictures are those taken outside in bright light.
3,"Baby Mammoth - 10,000 Years Beneath The Street","The Pork label has become renowned for its mellow output, and Baby Mammoth's first album is chock full of easygoing downtempo grooves. Still 10,000 Years Beneath the Street shows all the hallmarks of a first album - the individual tracks aren't distinguished enough, save for a few standouts, like ""Mysterious Muses"" and ""Binks"", the tracks blend together in your head. The album is still, without a doubt, spliff-worthy and perfect for a night of staying home and smoking, but it's the first bite of the delicious Pork chops that Baby Mammoth would go on to produce."
5,wonderful toy for little builders with imagination,"My 4 year old son loves this toy, it keeps his attention for a long time. He builds something new almost everyday using the instruction booklet and is even starting to make up his own designs...Love it!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"We bought this for our 4 year old son who likes trucks, and likes to build. What could be better than a toy that lets you build trucks? The pieces are extremely difficult to put together. I'm a carpenter with a fair amount of hand strength, and I couldn't take some of the pieces apart. The sad part is that you can't build the item in the instructions unless you push the pieces together all the way. If you don't push them together all the way, they won't line up with the next part, so there's really no away around the fact that you have to really jam them together. In short, my son can't play with them. Very disappointed."
4,Great book....,"This was a great read. I live right in Chicago, near Oak Park, so this was especially of interest to me. Iam not sure if its all true or not, but if it is, it makes a lot of sense. This book offers lots of explanations, i.e. Marilyn Monroe, Kennedy assasination,etc. and once you read them, they really make you think."
4,Not bad,"I found this book very interesting and easy to read. Personally, the writing style was fine with me. Corbitt makes a statement in the front of the book that everything he says is the truth. He also says someone will probably get whacked over it. But who? At the end you find out that virtually every person he refers to in the book is now dead. Who is left to get whacked and who can corroborate this incredible story? If all he says is true, it's one hell of story. That's a big ""IF"", however. My guess is that the truth is somewhere in the middle of what Mike Corbitt actually claims it to be. I also suspect Corbitt has many more dirty little secrets he hasn't yet told."
1,Garbage,"I would not buy this book even if it was for free. Who in their right mind would support a law enforcment officer, let alone, a POLICE CHIEF who was involved in these activities.Besides, I believe NOTHING Corbitt has got to say.Yeah... I read this book via the library. He was very brief about the Diane Masters murder. Wanna know why? Because there is no statute of limitations on murder. Corbitt states he would never kill and stated he only dumped the Cadillac. Oh sure. But read this book carefully prior to this murder and he is involved in murders, shovels, etc and all.I think he's full of it and ""if"" the military and government were SO involved, what makes one think this book would come out let alone the fact that he is still alive!??!I think a few things in the book were true but he should of disclosed all the facts. Why didn't he? Because he'd be shipped back to prison, which is were he belongs.God bless Dianne Masters..."
4,Meets our needs but not perfect,"We bought this phone because it had two lines and can operate without electricity (in case the power goes out and we need to make a phone call).At first, we couldn't get the phone to work without plugging it in to an outlet, but it did turn out to work just fine with no power.The speaker phone is great for listening in on conference calls, but it is not good for speaking up. People cannot hear me over the speaker phone, and I always have to pick up the hand set.My headphones that work with iPhones and the newer Blackberries do not fit into this phone's headphone jack, so I have not been able to test out that feature.Since our only requirements were for the phone to accommodate two lines and operate without power, this product has far exceeded our expectations with its additional features."
4,Solid Home Office phone,"I've tried something like eight different 2-line phones over the last eight years - GE, RCA, Panasonic, AT&T - and never been happy. The Panasonic came close, but then I bought this phone - it has served me quite well for four years now - and works as well today as the day I bought it. The phone is well thought out and performs well. Sound quality is excellent (I use a headphone almost exclusively, but when I use the handset, it works well too). If I have one gripe, it's this: If you are using the phone and a call comes in on the other line, the phone emits a loud click/pop into the ear-piece with every ring, and the caller's voice drops out for about a second. The phone itself thoughtfully mutes it's ringer, but instead you get this pop in your ear. Otherwise, I like it."
1,Head holder,It was nothing like the picture. I thought the bottom white part would come with it but it didn't so I have to hook it up to the chair which stinks because it keeps falling off. But you get what you pay for. It was only like 9 bucks.
2,This isn't really a book,"First of all the content is, well, okay. But don't expect this to be what you expect a book to . It is really really thin-- only 63 pages long. Most magazines are thicker. When I opened the box, I thought it was empty. The book was so thin I didn't notice it was under the invoice ! Fair enough;one might argue that you can say a lot in 63 pages. But wait a minute! That's not all. Clearly half of the pages have huge blank spaces...for you to fill the blanks with your exercises, you see.It is,after all, a workbook. Then there are completely empty pages in between chapters that are counted within the 63 pages. But what makes this so unforgiveable is that most the pages that are full have huge margins to the sides, top, and bottom. Some people might find the content good, but you can get a lot more for your money elsewhere in my opinion."
5,The Most Inspired,This is the most inspired Firesign Theater recording bar none. It actually gets funnier after the twenty-fifth listening. Prescient and wonderful.
2,Disappointed,I had hoped for a book with more detailed collections of the various prints created by Pucci. This one does not contain the images of what the Pucci prints are about. Very disappointed.
2,Don't waiste your money,"I found this book too broad, although it gives some examples, and tries to use some formulas to figure out how much your client trust you, nothing scientificly proven. As a matter of fact this book is useless if you studied or read a lot about organizational behavior and HR management. This book talks about the relationship between consultant and his customer, how important it is to listen, talk and respect your customer, but a lot of it is common sense. Also talks about team work. However if someone is not familiar with Org Behavior and HR, it is a good book for a start."
4,Worth It,This is a good read and worth while for everyone not just Advisors. Some of the examples don't really work for me like the girlfriend who puts on an Egyptian evening just to get invited along on a free business trip but generally I felt the authors have done a good job. I particularly liked the Trust Equation.
5,Excellent book!,"It reads well and we chose it for the required reading for a class for new consultants that join our company because it teaches everything we want them to strive to be. The basic message seems to be listening skills, so we also paired our training with some listening lessons and exercises. I would highly recommend this book to any consultant - new or experienced."
5,A book for all of us - it is a must to be read!,"It is a book that you will never forget. A book that need to be read by not only professionals but all individuals. The reason is simple, ""ther is no way that you will never be in a position to discuss and demand for something"" so the book will provide you with guidance on how to achieve your target/goal in the best possible way.A big thanks to the authors."
1,Nothing New,"Odds are, if you read books like this, you have read all of this before. Most of it is common sense as well."
3,Using Cointegration Analysis in Econmetric Modelling,"The book is pretty average. The author explains relatively well unit roots and tests on whether they are present in time series or not. When it comes to cointegration the author explains well the Engle-Granger methodology and its caveats. He also explains a dynamic approach whic is superior in terms of less bias in equation estimation and inference. However when it comes to the systems approach developed by Johansen ( a VAR approach) the explanations get confusing when it comes to testing hyptoheses. By trying to simplify too much, there is a great risk the non-knowledgeable reader can get easily lost and discouraged."
4,Very interesting mystery,"I thought that the mystery behind the Virus that the crew faces was very interesting indeed. Don't worry, I won't tell you how it ends...A very good read and should be added to the collection.P.S. For those readers who search out books featuring certain characters (I admit I am one of them) This book has very little to do with Data and Tasha who are featured on the cover. Their part doesn't even begin until the middle of the book and I would estimate is only four pages long."
3,interesting,The book is interesting but the premise is similiar to a previous Trek book:IDIC Epidemic.
4,"Good, but not Great","It was interesting but kinda predictable and it was annoying how the Enterprise characters just happened to be in the right place at the right time and then just happened to notice the plauge culprit and then just happened to suspect him. I think there should have been some real work involved to discover the culprit! Other than that it was a pretty good book, but i hope the second one is better than this one."
3,"Disappointing, but necessary beginning to Double Helix","I found the writing in this book terribly simplistic. The characterizations are way out of whack (I think Mr. Betancourt should have sat down and re-watched the entire first season of the show.) I give the book 3 stars only because I believe that this book was probably necessary to setting up the whole Double Helix saga. The book played out like an episode for me: it moves quickly and lacks in-depth details that I would expect in a novel. The only reason I continued to read it was because I know that Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Katherine Rusch wrote the next book in the saga and they are both excellent writers so I know I can expect quality from their work. I will be very careful in the future about reading a Star Trek book by Mr. Betancourt. But since Smith & Rusch, and Diane Carey write the next two books in the series, I know it will greatly make up for this disappointing beginning."
3,Good characterization but too short,"The first book in the Double Helix series shows the crew endeavouring to fight a plague on an alien planet which can pass through any type of containment field. Mr Bentacourt does a good job of potraying the Next Gen characters getting to know each other and learning how to work with one another. But alas, the book is too short and the ending is too convenient. I'd give the book only two stars if not for the good potrayal of the Next Gen crew."
3,An average beginning to a potentially great series.,"Mr. Betancourt had the unfortunate task of beginning the Double Helix saga, and it doesn't look like he had very much material that he could work with this early in the saga. The primary function of this book is setting up the plague virus plot, and it doesn't succeed in doing much else. It seems as though Mr. Betancourt wrote this book very quickly, not bothering with too many details (although the explanation of ""Bill"" Riker was a nice detail). The book moves very quickly. The plague virus is introduced, the Enterprise arrives, Dr. Crusher and the rest of the crew take care of the plague virus and the culprit who spread it very efficiently, and there is a very vague look at the mastermind behind the virus. It plays through like a forgettable TNG episode. All in all, it's an average beginning to the Double Helix saga."
4,Some Good things to Know and Read before Getting Married!,"Before me and my now husband got engaged, we decided to read through this book together. It has many helpful subjects for couples that include:-Not rushing into Marriage-Jealousy-Not being a Perfectionist-Trust-Goals and Dreams for the Future-Forgiveness-Sex-Spiritual Matters-Maturity-Finance Issues-Anger-Remarriage...and many more! I enjoyed the small cartoons on a few of the pages, and the boxes of verses as well. After each chapter is a ""Getting to Know You"" section we you as a couple can discuss what you have read. A great read for all couples getting married, or thinking about getting married."
5,Good reference,"This is a good book to have as a reference of important topics to discuss prior to getting engaged. Topics focus in on conversations a couple should have to help ensure their relationship is centered on what is most important: God and what He wants for both of them. If you want to make sure you are going about things God's Way, this will assist. It is not the only resource one should use, but it is a helpful one."
1,Not worthy,"I had a multipass C555 that had worked for 13 years without a flaw. I just purchased the L120 because laser printing was crisp and neat. This machine is really hot, it almost toast the paper. The software does not allow you to fax from the PC or to keep track of your faxed work as older Cannon models do. It does not allow the any external phone to ring more than once before taking over with a silence mode ring.I wasted my time and money."
1,Canon Fax Super G3,Not a good choice in my opinion. The ringer is loud---even turned down to its lowest. I have to unplug it all the time for errors---per support person's advice. I wouldn't purchase this again.
1,Horrid,"Day one it had problems, one major problem was that it has no glass scan surface so only flat paper items can be copied, no cards or anything else. On the first day we noticed problems but we opened the ink and we couldnt return it. For so long, people have not been able to fax anything in, our copies are horrible, theres a black line running down any copy or fax. DO NOT BUY! SERIOUSLY! This is old equipment too, buy something newer and better."
5,The Want is amazing!,"I picked up this CD after seeing Shikhee play live in Washington, D.C. in September 2001. First of all, if you haven't seen AL play live DO IT ASAYC! I own Android Lust's other two discs, Resolution and Evolution and they are great works of Electro-Industrial. This though, breaks beyond these mere genres, mixing electro with new wave, some bits of rock, and even a little pop... yes you read that right, pop. But don't be alarmed, this just means you'll be up late at night with these amazing melodies crashing around in your skull. I CAN NOT wait until the new album comes out after hearing this teaser. I think they played other new stuff live too, but all I can remember is the crowd breaking into a crazy mosh pit and having a great time. AL is harder, better and more raw then ever before! Wow."
3,A good watch,Disappointed there is no back light..wanted to use while diving...but a good and stylish watch
3,USB Cable Review,"The product turned out not to be the right cable. However, the customer service from Teaman was terrific. He processed my order & return very quickly & efficiently."
5,Great deal for the price. Excellent cable.,This cable works perfectly. I really do like it and would recommened it to anyone. It was affordably priced and works perfectly with my Sony camera. I highly rate this product.
3,I have a question... for the ones that already have this cable,I actually lost my usb cable for me Sony Cybershot DSCP100 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom. I was wondering if this one would serve as a replacement? I would like to make sure this is the one before I order it. Someone please reply with a comment. THank you.
5,Love it,I understand why this is considered scripture. It speaks to the soul. This translation is very digestable for Westerners without being condescendingly simplified.
3,Knowing thyself,"Like my favorite collection of Eastern wisdom, ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold, this translation of the Bhagavad Gita is less about Eastern philosophy and more about the struggle within to 'know thyself'. The war spoken about in this book is the war that we all can relate to, the dualities, the fears, the skepticism and then realization of the incomprehensible. The beauty in the Bhagavad Gita resembles the poetry of life, calm but forceful, stern while also sympathetic and compassionate. This book doesn't question beliefs, but it somehow insures that there is a belief, and offers different perceptions toward our own personal outlooks."
4,Accessible to all,"I have struggled over the past few years to try and make sense of various translations of the Gita. I would need to have glossary in hand and still, became increasingly confused by the language and felt I was lost in finding the meaning of this important piece of yogic literature.Jack Hawley has allowed me to find the beauty and the message of the Gita through a version that tells the story so clearly, that there is no confusion as to the lessons we are given.Key elements are continuously reinforced so we do not have to flip back for reference. A valuable addition to a yoga library of books and recomended as a first exposure to the famous scripture before attempting a more traditional version."
5,Missing material,"Publisher, my kindle edition is missing entry number 5 on page 131 of 170, location 2157 of 3847.This is the first translation I have read & I really like it."
5,The captured essence of the God&#65533;s Song,"It is evident from the outset of this book that Jack Hawley is more concerned with delivering the spirit and meaning of the Bhagavad Gita than a scholarly translation. On my way to India I began reading this book, and when I arrived, I found that there were many aspects of the Bhagavad Gita expressed very simply by Jack Hawley that some of the Hindus didn't fully understand themselves! Although, some of the beauty seems to be lost in over westernization of terms a couple times, it is very good through out. (Sorry, I can't remember the words I'm referring to here...) I think this book would be perfect for people looking to understand the Bhagavad Gita; either as by itself as an introduction, as a supplement to a more scholarly version for the student, or as a refresher for those already familiar with Hinduism."
5,The Very Best Short Stories (in an adequate package),"This translation of Chekhov's work made by Constance Garnett is exemplary. The short stories themselves are widely regarded as the best of their kind and many fine authors have used them as a guide to the art of writing, reading them meticulously and closely to pick up tips on how a master plies his craft. Yes, the paper and print of the books themselves are not of the finest quality. Nevertheless I am delighted to have this collection in my possession (despite the fact that I could easily have downloaded the lot for nothing at Gutenberg.) For a while I held back from making this purchase as another reviewer had disliked the physical package so much. I love a beautiful book as much as any other bibliomane but in this case I will accept the perfectly adequate but less than beautiful presentation, and joyfully, for the sake of the writing."
4,Interesting Humor but Perhaps Dated,"My family has been a fan of dear Dave for many years. I just bought this CD album for my brother, rather than transferring his vinyl album to CD.Dave Gardner's humor in general is good but can be rather dated."
3,Decent low-end lens,"As far as lenses go, this is by no means a great one, but you do get a good value for your money. If you're looking for an inoexpensive all-purpose lens that covers the most commonn focal lengths, then this might be one to consider.This lens has a few good things going for it; price, focal range, leightweight, compact, and the macro feature is nice.On the other hand, it performs better in auto than it does in manual, because the focus ring is extrmely loose. My biggest complaint, though, and the one that almost makes me regret buying it, is that that the lens, overall, has very bad bokeh.If you're just getting your feet wet in photography and don't want to invest a lot of money, then this lens would probably be a good choice.You will get your money's worth, but don't expect more than that."
3,Fair to Good,"I love this cruizin graphic on the front, but the graphic is little too small.The reason I rated 3 stars instead of 4 is because the color of the shirt is diferent than the picture. The color of my shirt was more a dark yellowish green. Don't get me wrong, it was not a puke color bad enough to it send it back! Overall I like the shirt because it is soft and comfortable and it's still cool lookin! Cruzin!"
3,Be careful of leaks,"I bought two of these, and one started leaking. I can't pinpoint where the leak is coming from, however, so I can't fix it. Just be aware... always put something under the heater to protect your carpet or floor, and periodically check underneath the heater for drops of oil."
4,A loving tribute to a wonderful breed of dogs.,"JoAnne tells of the Shih Tzu with good humor and gentle guidance. She truly loved the dogs and it comes through on every page. Great for a first-time Shih Tzu owner, like me. I have referred to the book several times since our Bailey came home."
5,Inspirational information!,This book gives you indepth information on owning a Shih Tzu including about breeding. I highly recommend this book. You tell that this author really loved all her Shih Tuz.
2,the final season to come out,ren and stimpy have done more episodes but then stopped at 1995 whitch the fourth seasop was made after the fith season and why make it uncencored its from nickelodeon and dosent even do it but trying to wait for the first season took longer to come out
5,My daughter LOVES it!,"My daughter wanted to be Wonder Woman for Halloween, so I ordered this costume for her. She put it on as soon as we got it and began running around the house pretending to be Wonder Woman. Her imagination is running wild. She loves that it's shiny and, unlike other reviewers, the blue shine has not come off yet. She's worn it every day for the last 4 days. It is a little short for an average sized 3 1/2 year-old, so my mother-in-law is going to make some matching undies. I think if we had gotten the girl size instead of the toddler size, it would've been much too large. Now, the boot covers ARE very large and they do keep on falling to her ankles, but they don't seem to bother her. She's too busy saving the world from bad guys."
4,Cool,This is good outfit. My daughter loves Wonder Woman. The only con was the headband was snug and one of the boots would slide down.
4,Great Costume...Runs Small!,"I bought this for my 17 month old daughter, after reading the reviews and seeing that it runs small, I purchased the 2-4 Toddler size. This costume was the perfect size for her and she wears 18/24 month clothing but is tall for her age. The boots were very cute, they were a little loose at the thighs and the shoe cover portion was a bit too big but I was still able to use them. We have had many compliments on this costume, great quality....I would just suggest going up a size to be sure it fits properly."
4,Great Costume,"My 2 year old LOVES this costume and it is so darn cute. After many, many uses I had to wash it and unfortunately the skirt lost all of the blue color. I plan to order the next size up because she wears it around the house so often."
4,So darn cute,I have not a complaint about this super cute costume. My daughter loved it. I was afraid it was going to be too tight or almost to small because my daughter is very big for her age 36 inches and 30 lbs. she just turned 2 in October. It was actually slightly big but I like that. That means we can use it for
3,Missng tiara,The outfit was as described. A ill big but not too much. The problem was the tiara was missing. I didn't realize until after it was to late to return.
3,WW Hero,"I have a daughter who wears 2T size clothes. This fit pretty well but the boot covers were too long for her- she is tall for a 19 mo old, but the range of the size is from 2T-4T. Decent product- met expectations."
1,Horrible,"We received this costume today and it is torn, with a worn out headband, and missing the boot covers. Very disappointing."
4,Eucerin Redness Daily Lotion,"I like the light texture of this daily lotion and the green tint helps ""cool"" down any redness going on. It also has sunscreen in it so an added bonus. It can also be used under makeup too."
2,didn't absorb well looks pasty love the gel cleanser nt cream,"I bought this and tried it. I returned it. It didn't absorb well, kind of sat on top of my skin, the green tint made my skin look pasty/chalky.I do love the gel cleanser for sensitive skin, and the night cream too."
3,not for me,"This product broke me out. I LOVE their face wash and night cream, though, and my skin is overly sensitive, so I can't give it less than a 3 star."
3,Moderately effective with some negatives that must be considered,"Bought to address constant facial redness for my son, and I also tried it as well to soften my ruddy complexion. It is moderately effective but it has some negatives that you have to consider:1. It is heavy and thick and not easily absorbed so you must massage it in well or you will have an obvious green tint.2, Since it is green if you are not careful you can get it into hairlines and eyebrows where it is difficult to remove and then you have green lotion obvious.One positive is that it does provide sunscreen and that seems effective with limited use."
2,Found to be Drying & Thick,"Bought this and the redness relief night cream. I have mild rosacea type 2 with redness, some bumps, a few visible capillaries and severe dryness/flakiness, Did not like this one. Nothing horrible happened when using it, but I found it to be drying to my skin and overly thick/pasty even when using a tiny amount. Wanted it to work as a day cream under make-up especially because of the green tint, but was disappointed. I am using the night cream as an AM & PM treatment and I really recommend it instead and just using a green tinted primer on top for make up purposes. You can see my review of the overnite cream."
2,doesn't work for me,"This does work for moisturizing and it does have spf in it, but oh boy does it come out green. you must use a little at a time, or you will be rubbing in a lot of green. problem is, once it is all rubbed in, you still have those red blotches you started with... some of your skin looks like it has been touched up with something slightly green or something, but the main redness is there. I must have bought the wrong product. Need something more for red blotches. either way, this product comes out very green and u must rub in very well. I do see anything special about it at all."
2,Not for oily skin,"My face would look fantastic immediately after applying this product, but as soon as any oil accumulated on my face it looked disgusting, and the greenish tint would show (I would look sick). Use in moderation.I would say this is better for red and DRY skin, although it doesn't necessarily ""relieve"" the redness so much as mask it. I used it for a couple weeks and noticed zero improvement. My skin actually got less red after discontinuing the ""redness relief"" product line."
3,"Hides redness, but doesn't really reduce it, better for fair skin","I'm a naturally dark skinned male and was a bit apprehensive about trying this product since most people seem to have fair skin that have the redness problem and have given good reviews for this product. It does a good job of masking redness but can leave a white residue and can be difficult to rub in. Overall I think its a good product however, I think its better used for people with fairer skin. I wish I could find one more suitable for my skin type that blends better."
2,Doesn't work that well,I decided to purchase this product for the number of good reviews it has but I was very disappointed after having tried it. This lotion is very dry and didn't cover up nor do any good to the slightly red area around my nose.
1,irritated my skin,didnt like the product actually irritated my skin. The cleanser i also used it and broke me out. the only thing i use is their night cream which helps with redness and eliminates it for me. I put some lavender essential oil in the night cream to help with the acne other then that I wouldnt use anything else from this line.
2,Eucerin Lotion,"I gave this 2 stars only because it will cover up the redness; however, it will not cure it. I put it on my face and because it is such a heavier consistency it will cover up the red because it is green.I looked in the mirror and it made one side of my face look pale because of the consistency of this product. I like the Dermarest much better, it actually helps the redness itself and gives a nice glow to your skin in the morning."
4,"Good results, annoying smell","It was easy to apply and stayed on well. My only complaint is the smell. It smells exactly like sunscreen, whish is not that attractive in my opinion. Now that I think about it, extra must be applied to the reddest areas. If too mush is applied to white areas, the skin turns green. it took practice, but eventually it helped. I also liked that there was no real perfum added, so it is good for my sensitive skin."
2,GREAT product if you are a caucasian with no tan,"This product just goes on too white/green. It never fully blends in with your skin, and I'm a VERY light-skinned Mexican comparible to East Asians. Coverage will be just okay if I put it on a small area of my face, but since this has an SPF of 15, it's meant for your whole face.Maybe its the way I've been blending this into my skin, but I can never really make this blend in enough without having my face look a bit ""off."""
2,Disappointed...,"After trying the Eucerin Redness Relief face wash, I was very eager to try this product. I had the highest hopes, but, as with most skin care products that are supposed to help rosacea, I was deeply disappointed. If you have rosacea that is anything past looking like a mild sunburn, this product will only make it worse. I think a lot of us would do just about anything to have their rosacea be simply a flushed face, as most of us have to deal with things that are devastating to our self esteems, and at the least uncomfortable and painful. This cream uses our frustration and willingness to try anything against us to sell their product. Take my advice and do not use this product. I had much, much better luck with Triderma MD rosacea repair cream."
4,GREAT FOR USE WITH MAKE-UP,"This products evens out the red skin tones and allows the application of ""normal"" make-up to be effective. It's a great product."
5,Best lotion for relieving redness,I have used this product for several years to reduce redness and it works fairly well. I buy it on-line as I can't always find it locally. I usually stock up when I purchase it as I don't like to run out. I haven't found another product that works as well for me as this one.
3,Good for those without dry skin.,"This worked well to cover up the redness on my face. The green tint helped a lot; however, I have pretty dry skin and the lotion did not help with that. It made the dry skin green and more noticeable. I would recommend it for people with redness but not dry skin."
1,Does not cover the redness,"I read numerous reviews on this product, very skeptical ~ your know, almost too good to be true. But it got great reviews, lots of people said it helped their redness. So I took a chance. TO GOOD TO BE TRUE! I got bitten again!! I put it on one side of my face and compared it to the other side and absolutely no difference. I smeared it all over my face and it did not even reduce the redness slightly. So very dissappointed. My local Walgreens actually discontinued the product due to low/no sales, I should have figured out why, if it worked they would have sold it. So, buy at your own risk but my advise, just stick with foundation!"
2,Cakes on and is generally unpleasant,"It may work for some people, but I sure didn't like it. If you don't blend it just the way you want in a short amount of time, it cakes, which is really frustrating. It's really just masking the redness. When I put my makeup on over it, it looked fine to start, but throughout the day it would start to cake and look strange. After a couple weeks, the redness never got better and I gave up.I never want to look more pale than I have to just to mask the redness. Don't cheap out and try a bunch of brands like this.. like I did. In the long run you'll be spending just as much money, if not more, than if you would have just bought a nicer line of product.After this I went straight to Ulta and tried Mario Badescu's anti-redness package. I'd recommend that a thousand times before anything else. If I could, I would marry the anti-redness calma mask.Hope this helps!"
3,"Didn't treat the redness, but masks it well.","I bought this product 6 months ago along with the night creame. After 3 months of using both daily, it did not treat the redness at all. I discontinued using the night creame, but continue to use the lotion as it does a good job making my skin look significantly less red by masking it. It has helped me to feel less self-concious in public and I try not to leave the house without it on. This 1.7 oz bottle has lasted me 6 months and still has a few months of use left in it. Overall, a good product, but not a good alternative to a dermatologist."
5,Only Thing That Worked For Me,"I have rosacea, not the pimples, just the annoying redness. My face looks like I have a permanent sunburn.Every foundation I have tried does not give me enough coverage. Since I have been using Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion, I have noticed a real change in my skin. If I use it daily, my skin the next day appears more even-toned. It is still red but not nearly as much as before I started using the lotion.I take a little lotion, not much, and rub it in all over my face, let it set for a few minutes, then puff on a little corn starch (face powder makes me itch). The results are flawless. My skin looks almost the way it did when I was a teen only without the acne.If you have a lot of redness, try this product."
4,"Not perfect, but it helps","I have cheeks that always look flushed so I was looking around for something that would reduce the redness. I found this and after reading the reviews decided to try it. It does a pretty good job of covering up the red by using a green color base, but don't expect a perfect red-free complexion. The lotion goes on smooth, but I've noticed that it isn't compatible with other lotions - it tends to clump and not cover well if the two come into contact. I use it under my powder makeup and it does soften the redness - it also works okay with foundation. All it takes is a small pump and I've been using it for over 2 months and have a lot left so while the price is a little much, I would consider buying this product again."
4,lots of fun for my grand kids,I ordered this after seeing the movie with my grandkids. Great product lots of fun. The only problem is it slips around when dancing on it. So I got some industrial strength velcro (4 /6 inch pieces) with peel and stick back and put it on the back. It now doesnt slide as much but needs to be placed on a rug. Lots of fun.
3,"Ten great songs, one great night","This is 1987-model Groovies (with Cyril Jordan and George Alexander) recorded in Australia, doing what they do to kill time while on tour: go into a studio and cut ten killer tunes, including the Raiders' ""Kicks,"" ""Money,"" ""Tallahassee Lassie,"" ""Slow Down,"" the early Who obscurity ""Call Me Lightning,"" as well as their own hits ""Slow Death,"" ""Shake Some Action,"" and ""Teenage Head."" They're certainly not breaking any new ground here with drummer Paul Zahl and guitarist Jack Johnson, but it's a terrific souvenir, with more great cover artwork from Cyril -- what, no pictures of the boys in front of the Sydney Opera House?"
5,A Good Review of a Tumultous Time,This account of the years from the Versailles Treaty till the outbreak of war in 1939 covers the events in Europe in readable and able fashion. I found it a good summary of the time. The author's views seem well considered and valid.
2,Poor quality and very cheap movie.,"As I have stated before in my previous comments, I hate giving martial arts movies bad reviews as I am not picky when it comes to watching them. I knew before I purchased this it was going to be B-grade but I didn't realize the movie would come with poor quality. As many of you might know, this is an early movie of Loren Avedon's and majority of his action scenes in his movies are packed with explosive...excellent kicking skills and fight scenes. The fight scenes aren't that great. The storline was ok but it reminded me a lot of 'A Dangerous Place' starring Ted Jan Roberts and mixed with No Retreat No Surrender starring Kurt Mckinney put together."
4,Lou is great!,"After Lou paid a visit to our school, I had to purchase this CD. It has the same songs he sang during his visit and my special education students loved them so much I wanted a copy for our classroom. We use it frequently and is a great rythmic CD to use for lessons and motor activities."
1,Cheaply made and trouble from the begining,I was disipointed with this phone from the first day. It has cheap feeling buttons and I was never able to delete the caller list with one swoop. I had to delete each caller one at a time even though the manual gave directions to delete the entire list but it never worked. I have had the phone for five months now and yesterday the entire colomn of speed dial numbers stoped working and will not program again. I will not buy anymore Aastra phones.
5,Camry Sunshade fits 2009 Camry Hybrid,"I purchased this sunshade for a 2009 Camry Hybrid, and it fits fine, although it initially required some maneuvering to put in in place. Definitely a higher quality than the sunshades I have purchased in the past from big box stores for $10 or less. Considering the cost of a new car, it is worth the extra money to buy a sunshade with a custom fit."
3,"It Works, But [...] Bucks and It's Not A ""Custom"" Fit","I've been around a long time, and should have known better. The old cardboard sunshade would have sufficed or the infrequent times I have to leave the car out or I'm away from home. Yes, the reflective part of this works, and it does cool our 2011 Camry, BUT it is not a ""perfect"" fit. However, it fits with a little crimping and you don't need to lower the visors to keep it in place.I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it's overpriced by half. With shipping, it came to [...], and even my Toyota dealer has one at [...].What's on my wishlist is a sunscreen like the one in the back window that just pulls up from the rear seat. (That may only come with the XLE just in case you don't have one.)"
5,Great Sun Shield,This sun shield fits the windshield perfectly and gives the maximum protection from the sun. It is custom-designed specifically for our Camry. I think it is a lot better than generic sunshades that do not fit nearly as well.
5,Business Slow? Get this book!,"Bob Bly has written an extremely helpful book for those times when business slacks off either due to a slow economy or personal reasons.Whatever the case, this book has proven tips and techniques to jumpstart your business during those times when things get harried. Suggestions like getting a part-time job during a slow period may not be what we want to hear but it is relevant in that it works until the business picks up.Other tips and techniques related to billing or customer service brim with wisdom and if put into practice will help any business large or small get through the slow times.Lastly, although there is no guarantee against recession and financial downturn, it's what you DO during those times that will make or break you. Do yourself a favor and get this book so you come through in one piece!Highly recommended."
2,Not what I expected,I was hoping for a better color payoff than the one I got after using this product.
3,Does the trick,"I felt like it was more like lotion than lube. It works well enough, but I like Babeland's lube better."
4,Up and Coming Country Star,"Kyle is a country star in the making, and will be around for a long time. Catch him now, and in person too while you can."
5,No 1 on the Armenian Children's Songs Hit Parade,"2Mayrer Cd fulfills the tacit promise made by the producers to preserve Armenian culture at the most elementary level, childhood, when mothers and grandmothers taught their young ones the traditional Armenian children's songs.Now that those matriarchs have virtually vanished, it becomes necessary for those who know and remember to pass on their cultural heritage to those who are in greatest need to know, the younger generation. This CD is your best bet to ensure that your children learn the Armenian songs of childhood.What's more, you don't have to be of Armenian parentage to appreciate these samples of a cultural treasure that almost vanished. Children of all backgrounds will be heartily enriched listening to these songs, and perhaps learn to sing along, even if it is in a second language."
5,Warm Memories of Being A Child Again,Music listeners of all ages will enjoy this wonderful collection of Armenian songs. Sung with love and produced with care - this CD would be a fine addition to any music library. Parents have an opportunity - in this CD - to share with their children the richness of Armenian culture. And for those grandparents reading this - do the right thing - and get your grandkids this beautiful collection of songs today.
4,Good but not great,"I am a historian. Heart and Soul. I saw this on the History Channel when I was 13 and was enamored by these documentaries. But, then, I bought it, and really watched it.I have several bonepickers with this documentary.1. They only have maybe 40 reenactors total for this. It really is a bummer, especially when they are trying to show very heavy action.2. The show wasn't well balanced when it came to showing the Northern and Southern point-of-views. Most episodes stick with the North. I do believe the North was right, but, I love seeing the war from the point of views of both sides. The closest they get to showing both sides equally is the Antietam episode.3. There are perhaps 12 episodes total in the series. But, they only have 4 on dvd. And Amazon, while once having them all on here, have only maybe 2 additional episodes.But, beyond that, they are fun to watch and do try to give you as close a look at the war as possible."
1,Wrong date.,"You would think that the History Channel could check the information given in their productions. This video gives the date of April 3 as the second day of fighting at Shiloh. It was April 7, 1862. Instead of giving a thoughtful and complete description of this complicated battle, we are subjected to bad acting by self-conscious re-enactors."
2,a little pro-union,"this film is not for the southern people ,it was very pro-union and viewed the south as un educated people"
5,"Very large, magnificent wreath !!!!!","I purchased this at an awesome price and now I wish I had purchased more than one. The size is astounding!! Not the typical 24 or 30 inch wreath but every bit of 36 inches and it's so full and lush. The frosted lights, combined with the clear lights and the dusting of snow, give it a calm, peaceful glow and I plan to use mine on my front door. GKI/Bethlehem Lights make the best products and they last year after year and still look beautiful. GKI/Bethlehem Lights, thanks for another great product!!"
3,Review in progress,I bought this book to learn B-Trees on my own and to apply the data examples (not program examples) and flow charts using Perl. The author has simplified the concept of B-trees very well. The material however is burdened by data examples filled with too many numbers that the author too has had a problem keeping track of. Page 38 figure 5.7 Step 7 and page 39 Figure 5.9 Step 8(b) both have errors in the data. Respectively key value 20 appears from nowhere and the key value 48 is duplicated losing value 47. The important definition of leaf page is not in index. I succeeded to create a Perl search tree equivalent to chapter 3 and am thankful. I am struggling to complete the add program. But I can tell you that the author and publisher have committed the error of arrogance of documenting programs without verifying by running the code.
3,80% flow when cold to the cooler.,"It uses a small coiled spring that snaps shut when heated, so the oil also presses it shut, sort of like a reverse trap door. Problem is that is the bypass for oil flow when cold, and the hole is about a 1/4"" in diameter. When running 5w30 synthetic and it's about 16c outside it takes 3 minutes for oil to make it to the top-end of the engine, while registering full pressure. Was wondering where a squeak from the top end came from after installing it, that explained it.It does work at allowing the use of an oil cooler.I would buy the more expensive Earl's Thermostat sandwich rather than a 'Thermostatic' one from Hayden/Derale."
5,SLAVE OF LOVE,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. I have not seen it in about twenty years, but the final scene where she is on the driverless electric train going through the mist and saying to the soldiers who are chasing her that they will be cursed by the people for what they are doing is an image I have never forgotten. She is an amazing actress and the director is also great, I should also add that all of the performances in this film are outstanding."
1,Not illuminating nor surprising,"This book should be more accurately titled ""Making Peace With Your Stereotypes About Muslims"". Gabriel does very little to distinguish between culture and Islam. One wonders if he can make the distinction himself. These stories, while they may attempt to be genuine, reek of an ""outsider's"" view of Islam as mystic, fanatical, or simply outdated. While these notions might serve as the base of more meaningful stories, it is clear that Gabriel is only scratching the surface.The picture Gabriel paints with these stories only serves to portray Muslims as people not worthy of making peace with, or even considering as humans equal to their glorious American counterparts. By hiding his own prejudices within his seemingly culturally illuminating stories, Gabriel, perhaps unconciously, gives new life to the spirit of colonialism."
5,I'd be grateful for more books like this!,"This book of short stories is really marvelous. Each story speaks to the heart and soul of America. I especially liked the title story, which takes place in Jerusalem and Ramallah. In these times, stories about Americans trying to understand the Muslim world are bound to be powerful, but this book of stories is very compelling. I hope it gets the literary attention it deserves. Bravo David Gabriel!"
4,"Good mute, but is really a two piece mute","The Dennis Wick mute is of excellent quality and has great tonal performance. I purchased it based on the fact that it was advertised as adjustable. The mute is really a two piece mute and is only slightly adjustable when used as one unit, a cup mute. It is actually a straight and a cup mute combined into one unit that can be separated. I thought it was something new and different. I envisioned it as something you could possibly rotate and change the sound.I already had both styles of mutes so I did not need it. However, I kept it, I am happy with it and the quality is great. It is a good product, the Amazon price is good!"
4,Gift,My Grandson was very pleased with the Cup Mute. It was a Christmas present.He liked that is was light weight and easy to pack.
5,Great mute!,Great mute! The intonation up and down the horn is even and consistent. Prompt delivery. I would recommend this mute to any serious player.
5,Made My Weekend!,"My best friend told me I had to read this book. I let it linger on my nightstand awhile but this weekend I picked it up to start flipping through the pages and from the very beginning I was hooked. I read it all in 2 days and couldn't wait to come to Amazon to see if the author had other books.The writing was funny and fresh. The characters made me smile because I could picture them so vividly. The main character, Rita, was like a real person, not like characters in books that are either too perfect, too stupid or too dysfunctional to relate to. Wild Billy was wonderful. I want him to come to my house and fix a few things! The girlfriends Cozy and Jillie were interesting in their own right and Wild Billy's mother and Rita's ex-husband were a hoot (and yet they could be very touching and sweet, not one demensional).Overall, a great effort."
1,Celestial Navigation by Anne Tyler,I found this to be a slow boring read. Not up to her usual standards I have come to expect.
3,Not her best,"Don't get me wrong, I love Anne Tyler. I think I have read most of her books over the years, but somehow this one had slipped through the cracks. Let's just say that this was not her best effort. The characters just never seemed to make any sense at all, and were really not even believable human beings. Tyler can portray madness better than most (and that is part of why I love her), but this book was just out in left field. I will give it three stars (a stretch) simply because I love everything else I've read by her."
2,Ultimately unsatisfying,"Throughout this slow-moving work, a small group of pathetic losers circle each other but never connect. No one ever achieves understanding -- of themselves or of the others in their lives -- and no one experiences any passion. Joy, anger, desire, all are shallow and fleeting.The only thing these otherwise colorless characters feel deeply is their fear. None of the denizens of this Baltimore boardinghouse ever learn to overcome their reticence and express themselves.Even Jeremy, the artist who lacks the tools to navigate his way through life, works in a vacuum, unaware of his surroundings, his thoughts and his own feeings.Although this book has touches of humor, and is well-written, it is ultimately unsatisfying. Tyler has done much, much better work -- try the 'Accidental Tourist' instead and see how funny and moving she can be."
2,I usually really like Anne Tyler but...,"...I cannot get through this book. To me it began dragging its feet by the 4th page, and there are so few likable characters in this story you just find yourself reading and wondering why. I have not finished it yet, it's taking a long time because I keep putting it down, so there's hope it gets better. I'm not holding my breath, though."
4,Tyler knows how to let us into character's minds,The most amazing part of this novel is how Tyler describes what's going on inside the characters' minds. I was especially intrigued by how Jeremy's mind worked. She can have very clear headed characters who are exploring the world in a practical way and then on the next page have a character who is just floating through life with his feet never touching the ground. I highly recommend this book.
5,Interesting Points of View,"A merry-go-round of viewpoints help tell this story, in which an artist loses his mother. We hear about the artist's world from the words of the women around him."
4,well written... bad choice of title... nothing remotely about Celestial Navigation.,"Well written story... read it because I felt obligated after mistakenly buying it because I thought it was about Celestial Navigation... you know... using a sextant to determine your position at sea. HA HA... WRONG... nothing about Celestial Navigation on any page in this book! Wonder how many others have made this mistake... probably the ones selling their used copy for 26 cents. (hmmmm, maybe... if I'm ever that hard up for 26 cents) A better title would be: ""Portrait of the (wimpy, agoraphobic) Artist"""
3,Insight into uninteresting characters - maybe,"This was the first book I picked up of Anne Tyler's. It was probably a mistake to start here. I found the book uninteresting because every character was. It seemed like I was politely listening to a friend tell me a story of pitiful people with boring lives, and nothing ever unfolded! Don't waste your time with this one. I haven't given up on Tyler, I'll be sure to read another, more recommended title."
5,Mysterious ways,"On the other hand, as this novel clearly points out - for woolgatherers like us life is a continuous struggle, a long chain of necessary sacrifices, the forced reconciliation with the demands and limits every day imposes on us. Snip: (...)"
5,Very great computer,I bought this computer and has been outstanding. I'm new at this and had everything ready to go within 45min. I have been able to do so much with this computer. My only problem is I waited this long to get one. I would suggest this to any one thaat needs a computer.A+
5,Golf Can't Be this Simple - the swing,"This was a gift to my husband and he just loves it. It has helped him more than anyone can imagine. It is precise, clear, and truly a wonderful training tool for golfers. Thank you."
4,GREAT SWING ADVICE FOR GOLFERS OF ALL AGES AND SKILL LEVELS,"Very basic, very simple, but very valuable swing thoughts and instruction. Well worth the money."
1,Horrible bakeware,I bought 2 sets expecting them to be as good as the other Corning products I have used for over 30 years. 1 piece cracked in half while cooking vegetable in the microwave and one piece cracked in half while baking chicken in the oven! I wrote to the company and they have not responded.
5,Great upbeat and songs!,"One of my favorite CDs. I just bought it, and even 3 years later it's a great, great CD. I'm looking to get a few more CDs, one from this year (2009) and one from 2008 - maybe even more :) Can't go wrong with this one! I love having a variety of artists on one CD, and same type of beat (fast)."
3,"Low Humor, Not Firesign's Best","I've heard nearly all of Firesign Theatre's recorded work, and this album doesn't compare favorably to their best. As withAnythynge You Want To: Shakespeare's Lost Comedie, the humor here is pitched directly at the groundlings. There's nothing wrong with that kind of humor--some of the puns here are hilarious--but imagine how tiring Hamlet would be if the entire play focused on the gravediggers...I'd recommend this album mainly to hard-core Fireheads. Those new to their work would be better off starting withWaiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him,Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers!,How Can You Be In Two Places At Once When You're Not Anywhere At All?, orI Think We're All Bozos on This Bus."
3,"Rare, Yes - Hidden Gems - Not Really","I'm sure most of these are not out on CD - and they are all solid 70's funk tracks but there no real gems that cause you to smack your head and think - man, people have forgotten this ... solid but nothing spectacular. If you're a completist, for casual listeners, not much missing here ..."
4,Puzzles made from words and their relative positions,"The puzzles in this collection are of a type that I really love. They use words and their relative positioning to create additional meaning. For examplePANT PANTis a pair of pans.Pro miseis a broken promise.PERSONPERSONPERSONPERSONis a missing person.Each page contains four such puzzles and solutions are included in the back. They were all enjoyable, some very clever and a few are difficult to solve."
2,Well-done for what it is,"This book takes a concept as far as it can go; unfortunately, the concept is a rather limited one. There are many different types of word puzzles, but the title of this book refers to the type of puzzles represented by presenting the letters of a word in a way that suggests a phrase. For example: de cision would be the puzzle, with the answer being ""split decision."" Mager gets surprising mileage out of this concept, and some of the answers are much more elusive than you might think.But at the end of the day, you're probably better off getting a book of word puzzles that represents a variety of types of puzzles, instead of this rather single-minded approach."
3,"Grant, Amy--That's What Love Is For CD single",The seller should specify if the CD is not a U.S. release. CD and artwork in excellent shape.
1,"These questions are a waste of time,,,pure junk","The questions do not come close to anything like the real test that I had and the content of the questions was completely off base and did not help me. If you insist on using this, go get some old PreTest books instead as they are the same kind of useless questions and are cheaper.Get these books, they are right on : Patho review for RObbins by Kumar and klatt : just like the examCecils Review of Int.Med : I counted over 100 q's that were like the ones on my exam."
5,Best companion for step 1 prep,"I used Board simulator on a regular basis, to check my preparation for the step 1. I helped me get 95 without a sweat. I gives a realistic picture of where you stand. If your are at the 70% mark, you are sure to get in the 90s in the Usmle. I shows your weaker areas both subjectwise and topicwise, so it is better than the paperback edition. Overall the most important material for step 1 preparation."
2,Disappointing,"Despite the excellent premise, this was a disappointment. The author completely ignores topics like traveling as a interracial couple, gay & lesbian travelers, mixed straight and gay groups, inter-faith groups, etc. Her ""golf-resort"" focus also excludes backpackers, youth hostel etiquette, or Third World travel. Some good tips on traveling with pets, but otherwise rather shallow."
4,It reminds me of a Lesbian _Old Possum's 'Practical Cats_,"Though it's strange to me, authors (Froud, et al.) writing about the Faerie apparently typically just make the stuff up out of whole cloth.Jessica Amanda Salmonson is one of the greatest and most sophisticated authors of Fantasy of all time. She was also devoutly feminist.A websearch is recommended; she's done some brilliant essays.Every entry in this book is graphically (though without any drawings) lesbian in nature, and many entries read like poetry."
5,Beautiful music!,"I have about ten Cds of the Hesperion groups music. This is my favorite. It has a richness and life that rivets me to the performance every time. By the time this disc is over, I am completely relaxed. I have played it for my non-classical loving friends, and they have also commented on what a great piece it is. The sonics are excellent too."
3,Ramona Forever,"Since Uncle Hobart arrived from Saudi Arabia, everything seems to be changing in Ramona's life. Howie and Willa Jean keeps on talking about Uncle Hobart. Ramona's mom and Aunt Beatrice seems like they are keeping secrets from Ramona."
4,Ramona Forever,"When Howie's uncle, uncle Hobart came from Saudi Arabia everything seems to be changing in Ramona's world. Ramona's mom and her aunt, aunt Beatrice seems to be keeping a secret from Ramona. I like this book because is a very exciting book. This book is going to make you keep on turning the page until you you find out the mysteries. Read this book to find what is going on with aunt Beatrice and uncle Hobart."
5,LOVING Ramona Forever,"even know i never read this book i love the title.sorry ramona and beatrice or as ramona calls u bezsse anyway lets get to the point,sorry ramona and beatrice book for not voting for ur book.i hope u understand.do u understand ?"
4,Ramona Saves the Day!!!,"Ramona Forever was a story about part of Ramona's life. The main characters were Ramona, Beezus (her real name is Beatrice), Mr. and Mrs. Quimby, Aunt Beatrice, Uncle Hobart, Pamela, Howie, Willa Jean, and Mrs. Kemp.I can relate to Ramona because she had a really bad time at someplace, and I have bad times at places too. I felt the same way Howie did when he fell off his unicycle.My favorite part of Ramona Forever was when Uncle Hobart told Ramona that he and Aunt Beatrice were going to get married, because it was surprising. If I could change Algie's name, I would change it to Howard.I recommend this book to people who like Fiction."
5,The Best book ever!!!!!,Romona Forever is the best book ever. I read all the Romona books when I was eight. Some of them I remember kind of but some of them I can remember SO well I could tell you right this second what the books about. This book was one of them. I'm Nine and almost ten now and I still think Romona is very good. I like Romona forever just as much as the Harry Potter 5 and all the rest. maybe I like Romona forever better!!
5,Loffes Langtradare (the swedich title),"I have read this book at least 100 times to my son Bjorn. And I still enjoy reading it!!! I think that says somthing of the quality of the thing. Bjorn is now 4 years old and we started when he was about 2.5 years old. The book has very good illustrations, detailed enough to be interesting even after a hundred times! We usually start to look at the x-ray drawing of the truck, talking of where the radiator is and whats it for, why there is a fire extinguisher beside the drivers seat etc, etc...I love it."
5,Big Joe's Trailer Truck Through the Ages,"A great book! My 19-month old son is another second generation ""Big Joe"". He asks me to read this to him almost every night..and I can remember reading this book with my dad 26 or so years ago. We read all the time, but Big Joe's Trailer Truck is the only one I remember after all these years."
3,A Nice Niche,"For her fans, Casandra Wilson can do no wrong: if you love her, you love all of her. But for those of us who enjoy her talents but still listen critically to her mis-steps, what does this CD hold in store?Well, this is a pretty good record. She's found what sounds like a comfortable, successful niche, with a drier, brighter sounding production that puts her into folk-based context. This seems to be where her strength lies, as her style and manner often sucked the life out of the jazz and blues she's attempted. The Jobim tune is surprisingly effective, and her take on ""Shelter from the Storm"" is superb. On the other hand, ""Wichita Lineman"" is almost unlistenable, crushed under the weight of her mannerisms. Most successful has been the further-developing trend of her own material, which has more and more become the high-point of her work; music most appropriate to her own qualities."
4,beautiful and out of ordinary,just listen and learn..................... what an amazing singer and what creativity in playing with the lyrics and the musicality required to make the melody something special.
3,Curiously out of tune,"Recording is good otherwise but there are several points in the recording where the musicians are out of tune. Was this done deliberately to set a ""natural"" and ""organic"" feel to it or were these musicians just plain out of tune. I can adjust to many different forms and styles of music over the course of time but I can't get an ear for these off kilter moments. I noticed another reviewer heard this as well. Anyone else?"
4,Give it few listens!!,"Wilson is great. I love jazz, blues, folk, alt-country, Brazilian. . .This disk covers a lot of ground, but the material holds together well. Not many artists do well with mixing genres. Wilson handles it amazingly well. I really like her version of Jobim's ""Waters of March,"" a song I probably have on thirteen different albums.My complaint is that maybe we could hear a few more horns."
4,Playful and Pointed,"Cassandra Wilson stands alone among the current crop of outstanding female jazz and blues vocalists. Belly of the Sun reveals Cassandra as completely comfortable with her own unique style to the point of playfulness.While her earlier efforts, Blue Light 'Til Dawn and New Moon Daughter may have challenged the uninitiated listener, Belly of the Sun is instantly listenable.Like always, Cassandra's selection of music is eclectic and entertaining. The greats are here: Dylan, James Taylor, Robert Johnson. So are unusual choices such as Glen Campbell's Wichita Lineman. In every case, Cassandra makes each song her own.Most interesting is Wilson's inclusion of some light, bluesy tunes that pull Cassandra outside of her typical sultry sound. Drunk as Cooter Brown, and Hot Tamales provide a pleasant change of pace that most will appreciate.Overall, Belly of the Sun is another strong release from one of the most unique and gifted artists of our time."
5,More Essential Soul Music,"Delightful vocals and production throughout.Cassandra regulars put this one right next to the classic ""Blue Light Til Dawn."" It features blues, acoustic, mambo (aka salsa), and African arrangements all intermingled with Cassandra's beautiful voice.It's worth every red cent."
5,"Whoa, wait a minute.","I have listened to Belly of the Sun over and over again for the past several weeks. I can't stop listening to it. This is Cassandra Wilson's tour de force. She is a jazz musician who delivers something the other divas can't . Notice the interplay with the musicians, the subtle changes in the sonic landscape, the shifting points of view. This CD is multi-demensional with incredible depth of field, sonically, socially, emotionally and intellectually. Don't miss this one."
5,Better than I expected.,I am very happy with this product. Thick plastic and well made. Works great to store my scarves. I will be ordering another one for my daughter.
4,Very Handy,I bought this for my mother & she loves it. It seems to be durable. I would recommend this to my friends
5,Outstanding!,"While Christmas shopping, this CD was being played in the store. My friends and I LOVED it! After purchasing it, I could not be happier! I find myself listening to it even after Christmas! It would be hard to choose my favorite song since each and every one is great. A wonderful addition to my Christmas CD collection!"
2,Disappointing Quality,"I thought this would be a great CD. On the show, Vonda Shepard covers many familiar tunes, always doing so very well. I own her album of songs from the show. Having heard the included songs of this Christmas CD on the show, I thought this CD would also be a fun and enjoyable one to own. While I really can't fault the performers at all, the recording quality of this CD is mediocre at best. There is a horrendous echo in many of the songs - apparently with the purpose of making it sound as if recorded live at the firm's watering hole. Unfortunately, it just doesn't have that result. In several songs, the lead singer - whether Vonda or another cast member -- will drop into the background and be indistinguishable. The problems just go on from there. It is unfortunate that the CD's quality is so poor, for otherwise, it would be a fun and enjoyable holiday disc to add to one's collection. Definitely sample before getting."
5,The Best of Christmas!!,"I love Ally McBeal and this Christmas CD! All tracks have a wonderful Christmas sound with an R&B kick! Vonda, Calista, Robert, & Jane...I could listen to their voices all day long! If you have loved the current season of Ally McBeal...you will love this CD. Buy it if you love Robert Downey Jr's voice!!! He is amazing!!!"
4,a merry compilation!,the cast is great. the best tracks belong to jane krakowski though. this lady should be cutting albums of her own. vonda rocks! dont wait for christmas to pop it in the cd changer.
4,Robert Downey Junior- a shocker!,"After seeing one of the latest episodes of Ally McBeal, in which Robert Downey Jr's character, Larry, sings the song ""River,"" I knew I had to have this CD. I went right out and bought it my local Sam and Goody and haven't stopped listening since. Who knew RDJ could sing so fabulously? ""River"" is without a doubt the best track on the CD.The other's are grea, as well, though nothing all too special. I recommend this album for a great holiday delight, if not just to play Robert Downey Jr's song over and over agian."
3,Makes very crispy corncakes and mini kugelhopfs,I would not use this pan over 325 degrees and possibly 300 degrees would be better. The molding is no problem at all but it does crisp quickly and cook quickly. I will next attempt angel food cakes and brownies in this. It is a beautiful pan to look at but not as easy to use as the heart cupcake pan. Because I own this pan I am not tempted by Nordicware's pricier mini bundt pans. I own this pan and the heart pan and I feel satisfied that I have all the cast aluminum I need.
3,Need More Work From the Creators,"This game is an interesting one, but completely confusing. I would like if it could tell the player what she/he is supposed to do. I try to play this game, but I am always bewildered about what exactly do I have to do to reach the next level. I just get lost and walk around for like hours without a clue! You should say something like ""Here you must solve the ........."" or something like that. This way people can understand what you mean and what they have to accomplish."
1,Worse purchase I made this Christmas,"I bought this for my daughter who is 15 and wants to be a science teacher. Neither one of us can figure out how to work it. We are not big games players, don't own a Nintendo, game cube, etc. We enjoy reading, but there isn't an instruction booklet to read. There's an encyclopedia type part which talks about physics, but we all ready own an encyclopedia. Then there is a game where we wander around but can't figure out how to make anything happen, we just wander around the same paths over and over. Some things are obviously important clues to a puzzle but we have no clue how to interact with these objects. Definitely not for a computer games novice."
3,Its ok but a loupe was better for me.,"Picked this up at my local Radio Shack for ~12 bucks. I got it on a whim one day in hopes it would be better at inspecting knife edges and makers marks then myBelOMO 10x Triplet Loupe Folding Magnifier. Well I found it to be much more awkward to use than the loop although the magnification is much more powerful. I don't like the light as it is very yellow. I would like it to have a whiter light for more detailed inspections. It is lightweight and does work but I think it would be better suited inspecting flat(ish) objects like stamps, coins or baseball card edges. I found it awkward for inspecting jewelery and mineral samples. It does take a little practice lining up your target in the viewing area which is another reason I prefer the jewelers loupe. I do give it a bonus half star because it makes a decent household emergency flashlight in a pinch. Thanks for reading."
4,A great deal as long as you know what you're getting,"I bought this for my son's seventh birthday and he and his two older brothers (11 and 16) really enjoy it. Its a very simple microscope without slides or very high magnification ability, but you can see the basic things a child would want to see, such as the cells on an onion skin, the fibers in the apholstry and salt and sugar. It can also be placed in a pocket to be carried around the neighborhood and is relatively sturdy. We've had a fancier microscope that were purchased years ago for one of the older boys, but it broke easily. We've had this one a few months now and it seems to be just the thing for a curious kid who wants to know a little more about things but isn't a scientist just yet"
1,Carson Micro Max Lighted Microscope,"Waste of money and not worth the hassle of returning! This item is worthless! The product description says it provides a bright clear image. It does not!! There does not appear to be anything wrong with the unit, it works fine but, the focus will not bring in a useable clear image, it is just total junk!"
5,Great,"Definitely a good portable microscope for general use. Bought it just for fun and it didn't disappoint. The picture is quite crisp, as long as you're not far sighted. I haven't tried to look at cells yet, but I'm sure you can (if you have some slides, and a light that shines from bottom up).The only small complaint I have with this is that light that comes with this is rather old and may fluctuate in brightness from time to time. Its shaped like an LED somewhat, but you can tell that it's incandescent. I'd suggest replacing it with a bright LED to maximize that image quality if you can."
4,Cheap and does it's job,"It's fun and intriguing to look at stuff under this small but effective microscope. Led light isn't the brightest, but it gets the job done."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This is a dinky little cheaply made ""toy"". It is difficult to use; difficult to adjust both dials and hold it still at the same time. It has a tiny little viewing area so, even if you could get it adjusted right you could only look at something really small and keep moving it across to see the whole thing.(not even one whole word at a time) I would not reccommend buying it. It is, in my opinion, a waste of money."
3,Pocket Micro,"It is what it is and works well for the price and quality. I found it a little difficult to operate, but when you get everything right it does a good job of magnifying the objects. I bought the AAA battery with an incandescent bulb. I would have rather bought the model with the LED but that model uses nonchargeable disc batteries. I'll replace the incandescent bulb with an LED bulb at a later date because the incandescent bulb illuminates with a yellow hue. The LED will also last longer and use less power. Overall I like the product and would recommend it for whatever you might need it for."
1,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for a portable microscope, that's why I bought this one. I was highly disappointed with it.It didn't have the resolution I wanted.The lighted feature was a plus, but not enough to change my opinion of it.If you are looking for a portable microscope, to look at your plants, THIS IS NOT THE ONE YOU WANT!"
2,Toy for children,"I cannot recommend this unit except may be for children to play around. It is very hard to focus and the field of view is very small. When I did manage to focus on an item I really found it hard to believe the 100x claim.I have previously owned Tasco 30x portable microscope and was looking around for similar unit but with more magnification. Whereas Tasco was pleasure to use, Carson was totally opposite. The old adage, ""You get what you pay for"" definitely does apply here."
2,More junk,"Again, if you need quality, spend more and get something other than gum-ball machine trinkets like this. It's a toy."
5,For ten bucks... pretty great,"I bought this microscope for examining the edges of straight razors that I was honing. After reading the reviews, I wasn't expecting much from this ""toy."" But I have to say, for $10, it's pretty great.Maybe I just got lucky, but the image is clear, the focus and zoom wheels turn smoothly, the light is bright and well centered, and it actually feels pretty solid. If you wear thick glasses or have poor eyesight, maybe the narrow field of vision could be problematic. And yes, it is a little confusing to have the image upside down and flipped, but I'm pretty sure most microscopes are like that. All in all, I'm very happy with the little bugger."
5,Microscope,Super easy to use ! Works great for viewing plants up close. Super small. A must have for any herbal gardener.
2,Light isn't bright enough,The light isn't really bright enough to see things well (looking at plant parts) and it drains the battery quickly; but it fits with the cheap price.
2,Not Good for Protozoa,"I bought 15 of these for a class. I will try to return them. Forget about using this for drops of pond water on a slide. While good for dry surface examination, it is not good for slide samples. The microscope just gets wet and slides accross the slide. I wish they would make this like an upgrade of their MM-24 that can hold slides and lights from the bottom but with a 100X power."
1,ya get what ya pay for,"if I could give this, ""so called"" microscope minus stars, I would ,,this should only be sold at ""toys or us"" ..not even worth the hassle of returning it,.. very cheap carnival toy .,don't let the picture fool you"
1,Just doesn't function for me,"This instrument was so small that I never got it focused on any object. It was difficult to hold the light switch to ""on"" and also look through the lens. Just didn't work for me.."
1,Cheap Toy,This is a cheap toy that is only worthy of being a Christmas stocking stuffer. Don't waste your money.
2,too small,"I realize this is a MICRO, meaning small product, but it is so small it is very hard to use"
1,Heat Gun disappointing,"Used the gun twice, second time it made a terrible noise and died. Total use time - less than 1 hour. I was in the middle of a project that needed to be completed, so i opened the case to see if i could repair it myself - what a poorly made product, enough said--- tossed it and learned a lesson."
4,A Voice For The Ages,"I went to see James Taylor on Aug. 13 and bought this CD the next day. His voice in concert sounds as crystal clear and smooth as it did 30-odd years ago. If you have not seen him live, he puts on an outstanding show! The best part of it is that at his concerts you will find people of all ages-from teenagers to 60-somethings and everyone in between! Anyway, my wife and I already have ""Volume One"" and play it constantly! You must have Volume Two to complete your set or get the other compilation that came out later. The first two thirds of the album are great up through ""Got To Stop Thinkin' 'Bout That"". The newer tracks were good, but not classics. Highlights - ""Secret 'O Life and ""Your Smiling Face"". Put ""Your Smiling Face"" in your car's CD player, roll down the windows and enjoy the perfect summer song!!!"
2,JTH2 - NOT SO GOOD.,"AFTER LISTENING TO HIS FIRST HITS ALBUM, I DECIDED TO PURCHASETHIS CD. THERE ARE NUMEROUS SONGS HERE THAT I'VE NEVER HEARDBEFORE. I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED....."
2,PROPOSE GREATEST HITS 2,SORRY GUYS BUT I WAS SO FRUSTRATED WHEN I SAW THE SONGS IN THIS SEQUEL TO HIS 1976 GREATEST HITS. BY THE WAY HERE IS MY PROPOSE JAMES TAYLOR'S GREATEST HITS 2 (IN MY OWN OPINION) 1. LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY 2. YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES 3. WANDERING 4. BSUR 5. UP ON THE ROOF 6. IS THAT THE WAY YOU LOOK? 7. SMILING FACE 8. BARTENDER'S BLUES 9. HANDY MAN 10.TERRA NOVA 11.IF I KEEP MY HEART OUT OF SIGHT 12.HER TOWN TOO 13.ONLY ONE 14.EVERYDAY 15.COPPERLINE
3,author with something to prove?,"I'm really in the beginning but i just had to say it's not an easy read. Does this author really have to prove that she knows every word in the english language???? Im an avid reader, i feel on some level educated :)) im starting to wonder if her words are even in WEBSTER!!!! ITS almost funny. But i do plan on finishing the book albeit suffering quite abit as i go."
3,Just Not Believable,"About twenty or thirty pages into Lionel Shriver's almost 400-page novel I decided that the entire scenario -- a mother whose sixteen-year-old son had massacred his classmates in a Columbine-like shooting now writing letters to her estranged husband -- was just not credible. I would think that a mother who had just been through sixteen years of fighting against a sociopath son, and the attendant global media frenzy spawned by her son's atrocious act would want to get as far away from her son and her husband as possible, not see the son regularly in prison and to write long incriminating letters to the father. I also find the very tone of these letters -- glib, almost to the point of celebratory -- distracting and annoying. Where's the depression, the haunting guilt, and the grief in these letters?This is an extremely dark and cynical novel, and there just isn't much to like in this novel."
4,Bad taste in mouth,"After a long time have I read a book this strong!It certainly left a bad taste in the mouth, just as I think it should.What depravity! What have we come to? Children killing children, children killing family, people who care for them!I admit that it took me a little time to gain interest in the book, but the last 1/3 was simply unputdownable. I also did not anticipate the ""twist"" in the end.This was quite a reading experience, and a book that will be on my mind for sometime; one that compels us to think and question as adults. Where did we go wrong? DID we go wrong? Was it our fault? Was it nature or nurture?Be aware before you get this book that, in no way, is it for the faint-hearted, and certainly not to be put on anyone's Christmas list, but definitely one that is thought-provoking and for mature audiences.You have been warned..."
4,Amazing and moving...,"The only reason I gave this book four stars is because I found it to be a bit of a slow starter, but perhaps that's only me. Otherwise, its immensely difficult subject matter and excellent writing made it one of the best books I've read in the past several years. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
4,Couldn't put it down ...,"A beautifully crafted, well-honed novel using a current topic. Think you've read it before? - well you haven't. This is an amazing novel using the nurture/nature argument for evil. Eve's letters are poignant, painful, honest, and loving. Her look into her family's life is sharp and focused; even when she's questioning. I couldn't put it down and asked a friend to read it so we could talk about it."
3,what about professional help???,"I liked the book. It was well written, it kept our attention but there was a major flaw. Affluent, itelligent and well informed parents as they seemed to be would seek professional help for Kevin. It was clear he was a freak and a mean one. After his attack on the sister any mother would seek help, would talk about the matter with someone, a priest, a friend, a close relation but there was no one, the family lived in total seclusion. Truth be told, I am south-american and from what I see on films and books, american families are very different from us: we cry, we shout, we kiss and we are always there for a son or a parent but american familes seem to keep everything locked up: they don't cry when a loved one dies, they don't try to console one another in a family crisis but even so, it does not seem possible that a father and a mother with a son like Kevin would let things go so far without seeking help, even from Dr. Phil!!!!"
2,Not for everyone,"This book is not for everyone. This author was recomended to me because I love Anita Shreve. Well, Shriver is nothing like Anita Shreve. I felt the prose was terse, long and difficult to read. The book is way too long. And at the end you really don't find any answers. Shriver is no doubt a very intelligent woman. She has a great English vocabulary which is thrown in readers' face in every sentence. Always ""ambiguous"" never ""not sure"". This book didn't make me feel anything ecxept horror. No sypmathy, no compassion. And the way it ends-I have no closure or undertanding of teenage angst either. It's like finding out about autrocious crime and wishing you never did."
2,No one to like,"It takes me a while, sometimes, to realize why a book bugs me. I'll already be twenty or thirty pages in, and then it hits me: I don't like the characters.In WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, the narrator is insightful and tries to be honest. But I found her so unlikable and alien and, well, largely despicable. Even among the cast behind Eva--her family--there wasn't a single character I could relate to.I also objected to the construction of the book. It runs the risk of being a stilted form, the novel-in-letters, and it always irks me when you get a line like, ""You must remember, dear, we first met Joe Stevens when...."" with the author then supplying required information the letter recipient was surely already privy to. This novel was rife with awkward exposition.But I kept reading. And that has to count for something. The subject matter is compelling enough that even without likable characters, and even with passages that made me cringe, I stayed with it until the fairly predictable end."
1,Are you kidding me!!!!!!,I can't believe I watched this movie! After the horrors of Columbine and now Sandy Hook. We wonder where people get these ideas!!! The parents of this child were they so oblivious to his problems?? The mother wasn't but why on earth who she take no action. This was sickening This boy was so screwed up from birth. I can't believe that the parents didn't do anything to help this kind out he was so sick. It was not so fictional. Sick people get their ideas from videos and murder games. Appalling. The movie was well made but...... Sick and disturbing given the times we are living in now and what's happpening.
4,Disturbing,It's not giving any thing away to say that you know almost before starting this book that it will end tragically. So I struggled through with a sense of dread behind every page. The prose itself is beautiful and very lyrical but the subject matter is tough to swallow. If you are prepared it's a really special journey.
5,Gripping. Almost impossible to put the book down.,"The way you get to know the main character through her letters is amazing. Incredibly complex character that is very easy to identify with.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House"
4,Sobering,"This is a superbly written novel that will take its readers into the dark recesses of a mother's heart. Early in the novel, I attempted to understand what made Kevin the way he was; later, I held my breath awaiting the inevitable emotional and/or physical destruction that he would inflict. The ultimate mystery is not what created someone without any feelings of connection, but why his father couldn't accept the horrendous workings of his son's mind before the ultimate tragedies. Kevin's interactions with his mother were heartbreaking and cannot, I believe, be understood by anyone without a psychopath in his or her life. This book is totally absorbing and has left a dent in my heart."
5,Nature or nurture...,"Nature or nurture is the problem Shriver is attempting to answer in her absolutely stunning novel. She really doesn't succeed in answering what is probably an unanswerable question, but her book is must reading.I bought the book after reading an article on it in the NY Observer a couple of weeks ago which described the book as an underground hit among NYC feminists. I am still shaking somewhat as a result of reading this book and I'm not stinting in my recommendations to friends to read this book. For a mother (or father, too) this book should be required reading!"
2,"Pass the prozac, please!","One of the most depressing books I have ever read. I had such high hopes from this book as a mother of a child with a behavior disorder, I hoped it would be a book that I could identify with the main character. NOT. I felt like I needed to call a depression hot line after the final page. Pass the prozac, please."
3,Kevin,"Well, I have to say this was one of the hardest books to get into, that I have ever read!! I pretty much hated it until close to the end and I started putting things together. I almost didn't finish reading the book because I was so disgusted with the way it was written. I thought the mother was so self absorbed and full of herself, but by the end I liked her and understood her better. I would have liked the author to hint earlier that things weren't as they seemed! I am glad I finished reading it, but it did take a lot of effort! My advice for someone who wants to read it, is to hang with it, the ending is worth it!"
5,Facinating Story,This is one of the most fascinating and horrifying books I have ever read. At first it starts out rather slow and plodding. My friend who recommended this book urged me to keep going. WOW. So glad I did. The plot widens and grows and then absolutely throws you off a cliff. We Need to Talk About Kevin is a heart breaking story of a mother-son relationship. No spoiler here - I will just say this; this is a must read but not for the faint hearted!
4,slow but worth it,"The first 2/3 of the book is very slow, but stick with it and you won't be disappointed. My opinions and relation to the characters did a 180! It definitely created some discussion with my husband, and I'm waiting for my mom and sister to finish it so I can talk about it more!"
5,Norma's review,Excellent audio book. Was not disappointed and was very much like the movie. I think Lionel Shriver is an excellent author.
4,"Stunningly written, disturbingly frank... I couldn't put it down.","This book deals with a subject that is both morbidly fascinating and horrific. And it does it with an educated voice that feels real. It feels like the whole thing was real. I was compelled to keep reading because, in the end, I kept forgetting it was a work of fiction.True events are woven organically with the false in a way that lends this story credibility, rather than a sense of cheek. And although I guessed the twist at the end about two-thirds of the way through, I wasn't ever certain. The possibility just occurred to me - and so the compulsion to read was even greater.A tragic, heartbreaking, thoughtful read for adults. Perfect for a book club. True depth, alongside real life questions."
4,Good read,Well written - great read - intense -not for the faint of heart - it had me duped to the very end - I can't believe I didn't see it coming
1,falling seriously short of entertainment...,"OK, maybe I am not the best person to be reviewing books. I read a lot, but I love to read to be either informed, or for entertainment. Why do people write books like this??? Unless this would be informative from a psychiatrist's point of view (then I would know up front I would never read it), then there is no point in reading this. Just an author who is trying to impress us with verbose language droning on and on in the form of one-sided letters. This is kind of like most of the ""entertainment"" on TV these days which isn't entertaining either. Skip this one!"
4,not true to character,"It kept me engrossed and that is what I liked about the book. Eva was almost as unlikable as Kevin. I did think the ending was sort of a cop-out by the author. I mean, Kevin should have really just given her the ""gift"" and she would have gone home and been totally ruined emotionally forever. Then we would have seen that Kevin was just bad, a totally un-redeemable sociopath. Like the ending of Edward Norton's character in Primal Fear. This would have garnered a five star rating."
4,Nature vs. Nuture?,"This book is specifically touching to me, as I was in high school during most if not all of the school massacres mentioned in this book.The writer attempts to find answers and/or purge guilts about motherhood through letters written to her estranged husband. She admits her faults but also scratches the surface of the old argument of nature vs. nuture. Was her son a hate filled person from the womb or could it have been something in how he was raised?This is a haunting novel which will stay with you for a long time."
4,4 stars - Interesting character study but pretentious main character,"I didn't want to write a review, but according to Amazon I have to in order to get recommendations.Amazon:Q: How do I rate an item that I haven't purchased, that I purchased elsewhere, or that isn't recommended to me?A: You cannot rate an item that you haven't purchased on Amazon.I get books from the library but like to rate them here so I can get book recommendations. Tell Amazon to bring back the ""Rate This Item"" feature they used to have for this very purpose."
3,Giving sociopaths too much credit,"This novel rang false for me. The narrator herself speaks like a Brit, in fact her distance and disdain for American culture kept reminding me that the writer must not be native born. No one here has yet asked, why did she create the protagonist as Armenian? So the past can be counterpoint to the present? For me, the portrayal of the protagonist as an ethnic minority was absurdly shallow, represented occasionally by forkfuls of food.Was her point that both parents refused to see the danger signals? More like red alerts, and at some point the story loses all plausibility, but the reader must read to the end to see how it is resolved, or not.For a brilliant, nonfiction look at sociopaths, read Gad Czudners ""Small Criminals Among Us"" or ""Without Conscience"" by Robert Hare."
1,AWFUL,An embittered narcissist with no understanding of the neurobiology of empathy. I'd give this baby-hater a -10 if I could. Don't waste your money.
1,I need to find a better book to read...,"I generally cannot stand books written as letters. (An exception is Smollet's ""Humphrey Clinker"".) Worse, I certainly cannot stand books written largely in the second person. So this will soon be a gift for someone I don't like much..."
1,Save your money,"I had read the reviews here and thought I'd download the ""sample"". Oh my god, this writer is so arrogant. Who but she to string words together? Honestly, I got through 3 pages; that was enough."
1,Fantastic read,"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read.A very well written,engrossing story that makes you think long after you have put the book down.I recommend it for any book club-you will talk about it for hours!"
1,Appalling,This book made me sick -- it's not for anyone who reads books for redeeming qualities or characters.
5,Fascinating story of a horrendous crime and flawed characters.,"Powerful and fascinating story of a teenage boy that commits a mass murder at his high school, told by the mother's point of view, a dysfunctional mother who acknowledges she was never able to love her son, through letters to the father, also dysfunctional, who has gone. I loved the author's wordage - these letters are sharp, witty, efficient, flowing and authentic.And what an ending! With so many books missing the mark here, this one is perfect.This view of a family dealing with tragedy, looking from the inside out, presents a unique perspective for the reader. I loved it."
5,Shriver's Brilliant Talk About Kevin,"This novel offers such a provocative and creative insight into two minds, that of parent and child. And does she pick an ""easy subject"" e.g. divorce, abuse, abandonment? No, Lionel Shriver goes for the kill, literally. Kevin is a school killer and even that subject she twists into the most compelling puzzle. Kevin is not bullied (or the product of divorce, abuse or abandonment). So what IS he? As the novel grows closer and closer to ""Thursday"" as Kevin's mother refers to the day of the killings, the frustrations mount as no one seems any closer to the answer--not even Kevin. By far the best book I've read this year and a terrific book club recommendation."
4,Horrifying,"Most excellent, subtle story. I find the writing style a little verbose for me, but still a good read. Horrifying if you have children, touches on tough issues."
4,Worth reading!,I really was intrigued by this book. Fascinating! And while you hate the mom; you also can relate to her. It's the classic question of nature vs. nurture. LOVED it and HATED it. Hard to put down.
5,Excellent Writing,"Shriver writing was of the utmost quality. The story was mezmorizing and at the same time disturbing. To think of a child born who was basically evil from the start, is perplexing. I loved this book & highly recommended it to many people. It would be a great ""discussion group"" read."
3,We Need to Talk about Kevin,"I'm finding this book quite arduous to read. The fact that it's all written from the point of view of the mother (at the moment - does it change??)is making it quite boring. I just can't get into it. I have only read 17% of it, but I just can't keep on with it."
2,difficult son....but clueless parents,"It is a rare event for me not to finish a book--particularly when I'm facing into a long day of plane travel. Though Shriver's writing is incandescent, and the tragedy potentially gripping, I listen to the narrator describe herself running through one STOP SIGN after another, apparently caring so little for her own well-being or that of her daughter that she uses her brain only to create excuses. Ultimately I simply didn't want to hear another word from her. I wanted to be written into the book as the next-door neighbor that called Child Protective Services and got ALL of them some help."
3,Feels like two different books,"I thought that the first 40% of the book was the worst written book that I have recently read. It was slow to develop and quite pompous. I put it down for months, only to give it another try yesterday. The remaining 60% was a work of art, masterfully written and exciting. My advice, skim through the first 100 pages or so."
3,Tough read,"There is no doubt this is an incredibly intelligent and well written book. It is utterly convincing in its portrayal of human foibles and our capacity to love. It also carefully takes us round the edge of our humanity carefully pointing out where we, and others, may leap off. Towards the end I found it incredibly hard to go back to it each evening. I'm glad I've read it, but I wouldn't read it again I think, but let this take nothing away from a remarkable feat of writing."
5,Loved it but would've preferred a different ending...,If I were her I would've killed him while he was in jail...I was expecting that and was thoroughly disappointed when I realized that he would live...
3,I tried--I really tried,I got 70% through this book before I couldn't do it any longer. The characters are unrealistic to the point that it's impossible to sympathize with them.
1,Don't bother,"With Tilda Swinton in the movie version of this title, I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. I finished it yesterday. I hated it. I give it one star just because someone bothered to write it but it's not worth reading. The characters bear no resemblance to anyone I know or have ever known, the story is much more about the mother than the son, and she's enormously self-indulgent and spoiled. The child is portrayed as demonic - do really demonic children exist??? - and the father is portrayed as incredibly clueless. Both my daughter and my niece tried to read it and quit after less than 60 pages. But by far the most telling thing about my reading this book this month is that my niece reminded me I'd tried to read it years ago and couldn't make it through. I had totally forgotten this fact. I must have blocked it out.I love a psychological study as much as the next person but this wasn't one. It was unpleasant, boring, irritating. I can't believe I finished it."
1,We Need to Talk about Kevin,"I started reading this book, and was finding it very hard to get into. I came to the reviews to see if I was off the mark, and evidently I am. I will go back to reading, hopefully as it progresses, I will become accustommed to the format, and be able to finish and give a correct review."
5,Excellent Book!,I am an avid reader and I have read many books. But I have to say that I have never read a book that made me think as much as this one. I loved the way Lionel Shriver wrote this book. She used many synonyms for common words. I totally increased my vocabulary just by reading this book. The plot of this story is excellent. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I strongly recommend this book to any parent.
2,Egocentric Musings of a Miserable Woman,"Shriver's writing is beautiful. She can poignantly describe a mundane encounter and infuse meaning into what are otherwise simple situations. The question of what brings a child to assasinate his fellow students and teachers is one worth exploring. But the narrator of this story is his mother, an egocentric woman who muses for 470 pages about wanting and not wanting a child, having a difficult child, hating her child, hating her husband, both loving and hating her job. It's tedious. I stopped reading after 150 pages and skipped ahead to see where the book goes, but it was just a continuation of the same depressing diatribe. The characters don't change, grow, or provide insight into life. It's a shame that such talented writing was wasted on the composition of this book."
2,Unbelievable,"I was pretty excited to crack open this book. However, the only reason I got to the 50 page mark was because I was in the emergency room getting rabies shots and I was bored. It is simply inconceivable that a cultured, self-absorbed woman of the world as portrayed here would write insanely long, rambling, poetic letters to an estranged redneck husband who thrives on hotdogs, six packs, pick up trucks and dirty talk, and probably can't even read well enough to understand what in the hell she's saying. Really, that's what you get in the first 50 pages. There is no way in hell these two characters would have fallen in love and attempted a marriage, much less raise children together. I cannot waste my time on a book that is simply unbelievable and pretentious from page one. If I ever have to get rabies shots again, I'll just stare at the wall."
1,Horrible,"I was desperate to read something for a loooong train trip, so I borrowed this from my mother. Well, I had no other book on the train and nothing else to do so pretty much read the whole thing. I say pretty much because I stopped with about 30 pages to go. I got to the end and I just felt disgusted with the writer and with myself for reading this book."
1,Did not like,We chose to read this book in my book club so I tried to read it. I was disgusted with the whole story line. The Connecticut shootings Happened around this time and I had to stop reading because I was so discussed. I do not want to sympathize with a sadistic murder.
1,WInge Winge Winge,"Couldn't finish this book. The leading lady is completely unlikeable. The prose is annoy and self indulgent and as much as I understand her attitude, I got sick of reading about how much she hates everything."
2,Much Ado about Nothing,"I didn't like this one. In theory, it seems like it will be good. This story is about parenting a psychotic child. The failures of the parents are highlighted in this tragic tale. It just doesn't go anywhere fast. If you want to read a book that has a slow start with a few interesting parts, this is your book."
5,Mother and Son,An amazingly gripping novel. You think you know the ending but you don't. It examines the mother-son relationship when it goes wrong and forces the reader to confront his/her own conceptions of love. It's hard to get into but after about 60 pages I couldn't put it down. I gave it to my son (age 40) and he was equally impressed with its power.
5,Very literal and very well written.,"Excellent book. I saw the movie first and knew that there were so many missing things so I ordered the book right away. I was right, the book goes into all the details that you just do not see in the movie. This is an excellent read. A very dark subject about human nature. I highly recommend it. It really does raise the question ""nature or nurture?"""
2,Be sure to listen to the sample before buying!,"I wasn't sure whether it was the voice of the actress reading this book, or the writing itself. But now I think it's a deadly combination of the two that makes this audio book intolerable to me.The writing is smug and pretentious - never using a small word when a large one is available. Like a college English professor writing for an audience of other college English professors. **shudder**The actress comes off as smarmy and fussy. OK, maybe this is how we are supposed to see the narrator. But if so, the author's choice just isn't working for me. I might have enjoyed listening to this, and been drawn into the mystery and psychological unpacking, with a more neutral, or more normal, tone. As it is, I just can't make myself listen to this. One Audible credit down the tubes!"
4,Hard ...,"I still think about this book, but wish I didn't. It was hard to read, in that you knew that absolutely nothing good was going to happen, and you just had to wait to see how bad it would be."
4,We Need To Talk About Kevin,i thought[We need to talk about Kevin] was a very good read.Ifelt sorry for his mother and also very sad
3,"Great read, but unrealistic characters","I agree with many of the other reviewers here.First of all, this novel is very involving--I was unable to put it down--but many, many times throughout I found myself rolling my eyes.None of the characters are believable from Franklin who is in a near-deranged state of denial about Kevin's nature, to Eva who allows her son to horrifically maim her daughter and doesn't make any real effort to protect her, to Kevin himself who is too sophisticated at too young of an age to be even slightly credible.Still, I read We Need to Talk About Kevin in big, long gulps, my body glued to the couch, my mind racing with all the profound questions about violence and motherhood that this compelling novels bravely asks."
5,you need to read this book,"it's one of the most thought-provoking, well-written, risky, provocative and haunting things i've read in years. others have ably described it so i won't say more: just wanted to contribute my five stars to the mix."
4,Holy cow.,"This was a great book. I couldn't stop talking about this book with my friends (we're teachers) while I was reading it. I was intrigued, but at times the book seemed a bit long. I had read some of these reviews and expected one part of the twist, and midway through pretty easily figured out the other part of the twist.The main character is somewhat self absorbed, but she realizes it, which is actually endearing. I was intrigued to find out what Kevin was going to pull next. Eva continues to try to express her misgivings about her son, but her husband Franklin thinks she is paranoid against him. As the reader, I wanted to pick him up and shake him; look at your child! Notice what he's doing! HELLO?!?!?!?!This book was tremendous. I hope you enjoy it too."
4,Horribly Honest,"I wouldn't recommend this book for everyone. The beginning is a bit slow, and perhaps not what would you might expect. Instead of a gruesome ""true crime"" novel, this book is largely about one woman's stuggle with motherhood. Eva is so terribly honest, that I found it really difficult to like her. I expected her to be a sympathetic character. In fact, I found her self-centered and grating throughout most of her narrative. However, by the end of this account I had wept and cheered for Eva This book was a definite journey, and in the end I found some understanding of Eva, Franklin, Celia and even Kevin."
5,Could not put it down.,"This is the best book I've read in a long time. To be honest, I'm not literary enough to comment on the book's strengths. But I did want to comment on some of the criticisms in the Amazon reviews. Namely, that (1) the book is a novel, NOT a dissertation on teen mass murderers and (2) an unlikeable protagonist does not automatically mean the book isn't any good. Eva's failings are part of what makes the story so haunting.I agree, that it distracted from the realism of the story that Kevin's problems were not addressed more aggressively by his parents, but his mother's negative, judgemental version of events had the benefit of hindsight. There really aren't that many SPECIFIC instances of obviously deviant behavior (although there are some). And in one case, Kevin is vindicated and his mother is shown to have judged him too harshly."
2,Disappointing,"I loved Lionel Shriver's book The Post-Birthday World for its imaginative use of split timelines, its character development, and its exploration of ambivalence, indecision, and consequences. This book, although exploring some of the same ground, does not have so much to hold a reader's attention. While the prose is well-written, the characters are all seen through the warped lens of the (possibly) delusional narrator, and that narrator drones on and on, repeating laments about past decisions and current ambiguities that become quite old quite fast. It is true that the author might be making just such a point, that this self-centered and over-the-edge mother is as much to blame for the tragedy as her bad-seed offspring; but the major points of this books, and its entire plotline, could fit into less than 100 pages...it is just too repetitive and unrelenting, especially for such a bleak topic."
3,"Fascinating, but fallible","The book gripped me, for no other reason than it has all the lure of the sensational, though original. The book has some really bad faults:1) overblown and annoyingly pretentious writing,2) the husband is incomprehensibly ignorant and/or simple-minded,3) it is way too long, and4) it is contrived.I always like a book that explores the whole issue of women who don't really want their child. Something refreshing about that. Overall, it was a fun, but OK read."
3,Wish ...,... I could find a relatively short review of this book. I don't have time to read these doctoral theses. Do people *live* on Amazon? Is this competitive reviewing?
1,Sleeping Pill,"As a graduate of Saint Leo College's Criminology program, I am attracted to crime writing like a magnet. Some crime writers have a God given gift for getting inside the criminal's head. Some of my favorites are Ann Rule, Jack Olson, James Pruitt, and especially Don Pendleton. Lionel Shriver is one of the least creative crime writers to ever enter the craft.She created a collection of fictional letters that chronicle a mother's life throughout her motherhood. The fact that her son happens to be a convicted mass murderer comes out as incidental.Shriver should have devoted ten times more material to Kevin's psycho-pathology, cut out all the daily grind, and left out the mother's unimportant observations on life.Shriver's letter writer needs a Carl Roger's type sounding board instead of a reader looking to be entertained. Shriver doesn't pay me by the hour!"
2,Lousy! Lousy!,I purchased this book and tried to get into it for a very long time. The writing was confusing and the woman just rambled the whole time. I really diliked this book!
1,A Waste of Good Money,"I wish someone had told me to keep my money in my pocket for this movie. I was so disapointed and did not even stay with it till the end. One thing that is not is easy to follow. It is dark and evil, something our country does not need to see right now. Watching this movie does not leave you with a good feeling or make you smile. Save you money and go elsewhere."
1,"Dark, Dark, Dark","This was one of the darkest books I have ever read. I threw it away upon finishing it. I can't remember if I've ever thrown a book away before - I would never pass it on to someone, recommend it to someone, even sell it second hand to someone.Why would a teenager plan the brutal killing of classmates? This book offers the answer in characters that are so dark, it's unbelieveable. I'm sorry I bought it - as the mother of a 3 and 5 year old, my times to read are precious, fleeting and usually at the cost of sleep. This was a terrible waste of that time. I feel terribly sad that such people might really be walking among us and dread that my family might one day be horribly hurt by them.I wish someone would have clued me in before I started it. I recommend you choose another book."
4,Brilliant until the very last two sentences,"Ms Shriver writes clear, concise, insightful psychological prose. She chooses vocabulary that continues to resonate with the reader long after putting the book down. Her story, Kevin, is brilliant. She offers beautifully crafted professional prose that is crisp and accessible. To bad that her narrative stumbles and is captured by the cultural quick sand, those unspoken taboos, that she eviscerates all the way until the very last two sentences."
3,I don't get the fuss,"Though many portions of this book are beautifully written and cover some seriously honest, disturbing ground, I found it incredibly hard to remain interested in the often meandering musings of the narrator. A page turner this is not and often found the passages convoluted and self important, despite the sensitive nature and the thoughtful way it was written.I just wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, even though I'm kind of curious about the movie because, obviously, the movie will not fall in love with its own language."
2,endless doom . . . .,"Forced myself to keep reading this in spite of the unlikable characters and altogether depressing outlook, and the payoff was a long time coming - the last chapter, to be exact. The format, a series of letters written to the departed husband, was annoying and self-indulgent, since most of the content was a retelling of what they had already shared and would have been already known to dearest Franklin. So why not just tell the reader, in a less contrived and more interesting way? She made me hate the husband, yet unbelievably kept professing her undying love for him and desire to have him back. Unbelievable on so many levels. The heart-stopping ending somewhat redeems the book but doesn't begin to make up for the first 300-some dismal pages."
5,Book Review,"When I read the last page of this book I just sat in a state of shock. It is a shocking story, but it is brilliantly written. Lionel Shriver is a master of her craft and the characters are so real you feel you know them, it one of those books which is very hard to put down. I was totally engrossed from start to finish and felt I had lived the whole thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good writing."
4,well written,"a very disturbing, but revelent book. this type of tragedy is happening so often in our lives. just shows us how easily things get out of hand if things arent diagnosed in the beginning.it also made me appreciate my son so much"
5,Brilliant Novel by a Great Author,"The gripping international bestseller about motherhood gone awryEva never really wanted to be a mother - and certainly not the mother of the unlovable boy who murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and a much-adored teacher who tried to befriend him, all two days before his sixteenth birthday. Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with marriage, career, family, parenthood, and Kevin's horrific rampage in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. Uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood from the start, Eva fears that her alarming dislike for her own son may be responsible for driving him so nihilistically off the rails."
5,A MUST READ,"THIS IS A BOOK YOU'LL FINISH: IT IS NOT A BOOK YOU'LL EVER SAY WAS FUN OR ENJOYABLE TO READ. IT IS A BOOK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO READ AS IT GIVES INSIGHTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE NATURE VS. NURTURE DISCUSSION. THE KILLING OF CLASSMATES BY WHITE, WELL-TO-DO YOUNG MEN MAKES ONE WONDER ABOUT PARENTHOOD, OUR SCHOOLS, AND THE IDEAS THAT MAYBE WE GIVE OUR CHILDREN TOO MUCH............"
4,Almost absurd yet definitely not.,"This book upset me and at times irritated me but I could not put it down. I was completely immersed in this family's story and where it would go. It went where most do not. A book for those interested in psychology, family dynamics and truth that is blinding this is a good read."
2,Hard going - needs a good edit,"I was attracted to the theme of this book, but the author makes you work excessively hard in getting to the core. This book could have used a redraft and/or a good hard edit - I was struggling to get through it and skipped quite a lot of it. Not because I have a short attention span, but because of the repetition and focus on boring minutiae, which I don't think adds anything to the story. I'm not sure whether the author thinks her readers are unable to grasp subtleties therefore need everything spelled out for them, but I feel this could have been fixed with further drafting - it really has the feel of being a little undercooked. Better editing would have also fixed the misuse of many complex words and phrases, which you do not expect to read when the format is letters from a professional travel writer (the narrator). All power to the author for winning the 2005 Orange prize and achieving success in a tough market, but I would not rush out to read her other books."
3,Hauntingly disturbing,"The book was well-written, the characters well-developed and the plot riveting. The question remains, do you want this disturbing content in your brain? The images conjured cannot be forgotten. The disturbing relationships cannot be understood. I, for one, wish I'd never read this book. It doesn't positively contribute to my life nor give me something to emulate. Best to leave it unread, smoldering in its negativity."
4,A great read but . . .,"THis is a fast read and well written. A horrifying story and it has some amazing twists. The author knows what she is doing. BUT I would bet my bottom dollar the author is not a mother. She writes about her baby as though she never loves him. Ever. He screams all the time and even at seven months he apparently stops only when the father gets home to make the mother look bad. First of all as a mother of five kids I know that moms love their screamers even when the moms are driven mad. Yes, post partum depression can create bad feelings but this character NEVER loves the boy and she does not know what a seven month old is like. They certainly are not calculating. Then inexplicably at the end, this crazy sociopath son gets some redeeming qualities. So I don't buy the premise even though I finished the book with pleasure."
1,A Travesty,"This is easily the worst book I have ever read, and in my opinion, one of the worst books ever to be published. The only reason I didn't put it down was because I couldn't believe it had actually been published. I had to read the whole thing to believe it. None of characters were complete or credible. The premise was timely but that's about it. The narrator is totally negative and appears to be a sociopath. It's obvious the author has no psychological understanding of human nature. Because Eva is the narrator, and we only hear her side of the story, we never know if she is telling the truth. And I do not find her vocabulary (sprinkled with rarely used words) particularly intelligent, clever or amusing. Her tone is arrogant and self serving. What bothers me the most is that some readers will actually think the work is representative of the human race. I find the novel insulting and nonsensical--not to mention appauling and disappointing. And these are my positive comments."
2,A bit like hard work,"While you would never expect this story to be easy to read, it feels like it was written with a thesaurus on hand. It was difficult not just in content, but in form. Why use 2 syllables when you can use 4?"
3,Harsh and Disturbing Novel,Maybe it's my position as a school teacher that made this novel disturbing to me. I felt as though I was watching a slow train wreck before my eyes through the novel. I did not enjoy this novel. Kevin and the family portrayed in the novel should have been in counseling way before Kevin commits his crime.
3,We need to talk about making this novel shorter!,"This book has an interesting premise and I like the fact tha the Nature V's Nurture discussion is brought up throughout the book. I realise that in the event of your Son going on a rampage and killing his classmates would have a negative effect on anyones psyche...I did however feel that this loathing of life and son became a little repetative and long winded...I just wanted her to stop the whole self pity and at least attempt to cope. She was so busy feeling sorry for her self, the most I could feel for her was sympathy, alas no empathy...So I always felt distant from her. Maybe that was Lionel Shivers plan.. Mmm..Having said that I was impressed by the end and was pleased I made myself finish it. I just feel the novel would be better if it were shorter.."
5,"About Kevin, Relevant, From an entirely different perspective I found Fascinating & engrossing","About Kevin, Relevant, From an entirely different perspective I found Fascinating & engrossing. Must Read. Definitely her best work! A mothers own unfiltered realistic look at her own child, a father's love & it's blind spots."
4,Surprise,"I purchased this book last year after the film trailer peaked my interest. Although slower than most books, once the ball began rolling I couldn't put it down. I've recommended this to so many people after reading, and was anxious to see the movie. Hands down, I loved the book more!"
2,Lack of dialogue makes this book drag on forever,"I was intrigued by the letter format (the story is told through a series of letters from Eva to her husband). However, I found this book difficult to read and felt as though I was slogging through rather dry writing due to the lack of dialogue. I did like the ending, which made the read worthwhile, but it took a long time for the story to arrive at its conclusion."
5,Whoa!,"The writing in this story is as soothing as a cool drink on a sweltering day. I kept stopping to read bits of paragraphs and sentences to my husband; I relished every single page of this book. I just love the way that Lionel Shiver brings the story to life, and the exploration of ambiguity in motherhood is something that you just don't get to read about every day.Kevin's character was a bit unbelievable (I don't believe in a baby being evil from birth), but he served well as a device for Eva's development. Eva Katchadourian is one of the most memorable characters I've ever had the pleasure of being acquainted with. Honestly, I really want to read another book by Shriver, but I'm a bit nervous that her others may not live up to this one, so I haven't done it yet."
5,Wow.... just wow.....,"I started this last night and spent all day today on the couch finishing it. It's an amazing novel. While there isn't any character that's actually likeable, all are understandable, and I found myself empathizing with the emotions if not with the actions. There are no easy answers here -- while both parents seem to have contributed to the tragedy in different ways, the fact that I can think that from a distance underscores the fact that human relations are difficult and that parenting is never easy. One of my private terrors has always been birthing a child and then not liking him/her -- now I know how it must feel."
5,What a story!,"This is such a timely topic--a troubled adolescent who committs a school shooting--that you think the story would be predictable, but it is anything but. Shriver gives us the parents side of events in the form of letters from a wife to her husband. The reader is given all of the facts early in the story--yet the book has unexpected and mesmerizing plot turns. Really makes you think about the relationship between parents and their children, and our ability to delude ourselves. Great read!"
2,Why didn't anyone talk about Kevin?,"Although very well written, and certainly a compelling plot, the story suffers some serious flaws. Is the reader to believe the mother's account of her son's horrifying behavior and not wonder why, over the course of his 15 years, indeed no one EVER broached the fact that he might be severely disturbed and in need of outside help? The title is misleading - not one person ever says to the two self absorbed parents ""We need to talk about Kevin"". For this reason the book didn't work for me."
4,one REALLY bad seed,"After reading the first couple dozen pages, I thought this novel was going nowhere. I was almost ready to toss it aside, but all the positive reviews here kept me reading, to which I am thankful for, as this is one of the most chilling examinations of the psychopathic mind that you are ever likely to come across in fiction. Aside from this slow start, the only other fault I had with the novel was that the dad seemed totally clueless and constantly explained away his son's acts in one way or another, though I suppose this may be the wickedly humorous part that some reviews alluded to. One may debate whether the etiology of Kevin's behavior as portrayed in the novel is accurate or not, but it certainly is miles ahead of Gus Van Zant's critically acclaimed (!!!) pseudo-documentary about the Columbine massacre, ELEPHANT. This book makes a good companion piece to Putsata Reang's DEADLY SECRETS, a true crime book about two high school buddies who massacre an entire family."
5,WOW!,"I have read over 70 books this past year due to being laid up for a lengthy amount of time as a result of an injury. I must say this was one of the most riveting novels I have read. I could not put it down, yet at times I had to take a breather because of it's intensity.... I had to step away, collect my thoughts and then resume the book. Outstanding book. Highly recommend."
3,Sad,"The first three quarters of this book was slow moving and boring. It established that the mother was cold, resentful and jealous of her son Kevin. She was angry even through the pregnancy because she couldn't drink or travel and found no bond after the birth. The child could clearly tell that the mother did not want him. As time progressed, it became clear that the child had other issues that even a loving mother might not be able to overcome. He was still in diapers at age six and refused to eat so that the mother would leave food as you would a dog and he would eat it after she was gone. He had an extremely loving father who refused to see any possibility that something was wrong with Kevin which caused extreme stress in the marriage. It was a very sad story with a tragic ending that is impossible to predict what would have changed the outcome."
1,No one to root for,"I have to admit that after 150 pages, I gave up on this book. There was a time when I would finish every book I bought no matter how bad it was. I guess I'm just either too old or have too many books now to finish that I feel like I don't have time to waste reading bad books. There were no characters in this book to care about. Pretty much everyone is a villain. That may not be the appropriate word, but it's going to have to do. Also, it seemed to me like the author had just received a shiny new thesaurus and wanted to wear that thing out. It was tedious and unnecessary."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" pretends to be a look into the psycology of a teenage mass murderer, but it's really a low-rent Steven King horror story. Too long by at least twice, the book hinges on a plot device that would have made a great short story but isn't enough to sustain it. The characters are unconvincing cardboard cutouts, and the nerosis and narcismism of the mother so suffocating I found myself wishing he had killed her instead and spared us all this drivel."
1,Put me to sleep,I got this book after reading the back description. It looked like it would be an interesting read. I couldn't get through more that 1/4 of this book. Boring. The narrator rambles too much.Reading this book made me sleepy.
1,Don't be a sucker,"If you have bought ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You? The Complete 1st ad 2nd Season"" and all 3 seasons of ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" Don't be a sucker and buy this cause they got a new cover. This is WB way of trying to get more money off people cause they hope no one will think about looking at the back or paying too close attention to what's on the back. The episodes on this come from one of the 2 series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. ""Go West, Young Scooby"" and ""Gentlemen, Start Your Monster"" come from ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" and ""Foul Play in Funland"" is from the first season of ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"". So if you got any of the seasons don't buy this and if you don't buy them instead of wasting your money for 3 episodes, especially if you're a Scooby fan. Happy shopping."
2,haven't received it,"I have not received an issue or heard from the publishers confirming my subscription. I was looking forward to reading it, but...."
4,Good speaker Karaoke,"I have been looking at the 10"" BMB and VocoPro Karaoke speaker but disappointed with the sound and build quality of those. This JBL speaker is very well-built, and has been sounding very well when cranked up (it sounds better cranked up). The price is about the same as the other karaoke speakers, and of course, it's made by JBL."
1,Major Disappointment,"Don't waste your money on this.Percy Sledge had some great records. But this is not one of them.In small letters on the back of the CD, it says ""New stereo recordings by the original artist"". When you listen to it (please don't!), you'll realize that these are not the original recordings. Definitely NOT the original Muscle Shoals musicians or the cool production.I don't know who or what this is but the music sounds lame, almost like a warped LP with the needle floating up and down. I would give it zero stars if that was an option.Don't be fooled by this one. There are very good collections of Percy Sledge's music out there. Get the Atlantic or Rhino compilations -- not this one."
3,Too Short!,"While this is a very elegant looking tree, I underestimated how large it was going to be. I know it says Petite, but I at least thought that it would be tall enough to hold necklaces on, which it does, but they all touch the ground when they're hanging. For the money, not really worth it. If the normal size one was cheaper, then that's the one to get because at least that one would really be tall enough to hang your necklaces on."
5,Fascinating reading,"This book is subtitled:A Collection of Hermits and Recluses, Their Ways of Life and the Stories Behind Their RetreatsIn it are profiles of the following:The Collyer BrothersMary E. WoodElla WendelMary and William Colgate ColbyThe Leary SistersSylvia Green WilksThe Herzog SistersThe RomerosMary Bullock PowersGertrude Tredwelland many more!"
1,Huge Disapointment,"The software will not download. The web site you are directed to as an alternative to the disc in order to download the programs does not operate with Vista. The frustration level is over the top. Had the software downloaded, this would be a great product. Sadley that is not the case."
2,not what I expected,"While this book is very informative on its subject, the software is so old that it won't run on windows 7. This makes it difficult to try out the ideas in the book"
2,Outdated,"Not quite what I expected. The software is outdated and doesn't even work right. I guess it's an interesting book if you just want to read it, but don't think you're going to be building a virtual human. I'm glad I bought it used and paid a third of the retail price."
2,United Nations building elevator music,"Frisell assembles a crack team of international musicians for what promises to be an interesting excursion into World Music territory. The arrangements and playing, however, are so deliberately tasteful and cautiously shaped that any individuality, even Frisell's, is lost in a soft, vaguely global haze. He really could stand another go with a band like Naked City, just to shake him awake again"
4,A different perspective on the war in Korea,General Paik's work stands out among the many works on the Korean War because of his focus on the operations of the Republic of Korea (ROK) forces. Highly recommended to readers looking for information that goes beyond the American contributions to the struggle. The operational details and accounts of the interaction of American and ROK commanders are fascinating. The book suffers slightly from a lack of detailed maps that assist readers in following the movements of the oppossing forces.
5,Great look at the Korean Side of the conflict,"I really enjoyed reading this book by probably the most celebrated Korean General of all time. While it is true that the Korean Army wasn't usually up to the standards of the American Army, Paik's units always seemed to be pretty close in every history of the war. Highly recommended book for anyone that wants to learn more about the Korean War."
4,Kierkegaard for Everyone,"A very well written, and readable book. The author does a good job of fleshing out the context in each time period of SK's life. The reader comes to know the people who were important to SK both personally and professionally. And, SK's important writings are put within the context of his life and culture. Garff has a sense of humor, and temperance in his editorializing. You don't have to be a fan of Kierkegaard to enjoy this book."
5,A great comp.,"This is another great compilation! I was skeptical of this CD when it was given to me. BUt, it is truly surprising. In general I have been negative about compilations in the past. But, I received several of these Ken Burns Jazz comps for Xmas. I have to admit they are all superior CD's that stand on their own. This is a great selection of songs by a genius its an excellent place to start a Monk collection as well its a great addition to a completists collection. Thelonious Monk was the first jazz that ever really excited me. I have a lot of his albums my favorite being Misterioso. But, I have to say this one has been in my CD player a lot. If this is your first Monk CD I think you will be in for a fantastic experience listening to a visionary, and any longtime fan will see the great innovative genius that we miss. Enjoy!"
5,The multiplicity and distinctiveness of Aboriginal voices,"Collaboratively compiled and co-edited by Ute Lischke (Cultural Studies, Wilfrid Laurier University-Waterloo, and David T. McNab (Native Studies, Atkinson College, York University, Toronto), Walking A Tightrope: Aboriginal People And The Representations identifies and examines the multiplicity and distinctiveness of Aboriginal voices and their representations as they have portrayed themselves and as others have characterized them in literature and film. A collection of impeccable and impressive scholarship by a number of noted contributors, Walking A Tightrope is an informed and informative contribution to Native American Studies, which surveys Aboriginal notions of time/history, land, culture, identifies, literacies, and more."
5,You'll hum along,"I was hanging out at a local concert venue, not impressed at all with the other bands, when Ludo took the stage. I was blown away. They're an awesome band, with a great sound and absolutely hilarious lyrics! You should definately buy their CD, it's great, and unlike other bands, who have one hit song and the rest of the CD is crap, every single Ludo song is worth listening to. No duds here! My favs are Saturday Night Thunderbolt and Good Will Hunting by Myself."
5,Can't believe these guys aren't bigger,"A friend introduced me to Ludo a little over a year ago and I've been a fan ever since. ""Ode to Kevin Arnold"" is a true classic. Grooves are infectious and just genuinely fun.The little known facts section of the band's official webpage is also priceless. Do yourself a favor and check that out."
5,Good Will Hunting Rocks!,"OK to be honest, I had never heard of Ludo until I saw them open for The Presidents at House of Blues in Anaheim a couple of weeks ago. They ROCKED!! So I decided to buy a copy of their album, I was not disappointed.Their quirky lyrics over the heavy ska/punk instrumentals makes for a great combination, and Ludo has quickly taken their position as a most played on my MP3 player.Great songs, lots of fun, mounds of attitude, and `I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself!'"
5,I love this book!,"This book takes place in the Netherlands and is about a girl named Lysbeth van Hout. Actually, the last 2/3 of the book is about her son Foy. I will not give away what happens, but I will say that I loved this book. If you are a guy, it is not a girlie book at all. It is written by a man. But girls will still love it too. I know I did."
5,"Gripping, heart-stopping, page-turning drama!","Diane Noble's novel ""The Veil"" is a masterpiece of historical fiction based on grim-but-true historical fact. As you trek across America with this band of pioneers, you'll feel every pebble in your shoe, taste every mouthful of prairie dust, and grieve with every disappointment these characters face as they journey toward their inevitable fate. And yet, despite the sorrow, there is a shining redemption that comes through in ""The Veil."" Only Diane Noble could find hope and glory in such a story, and bring it to life with such dramatic detail. In a word...I loved it!"
4,Good story,"Overall, this is a really good book. At times the story-line is disturbing but it is documenting historical occurrences (though it is a work of fiction.) Diane Noble is very good at developing the characters into persons with whom the reader can relate. I, and several friends, have enjoyed the book and do recommend it."
2,shoddy clasp,"These earrings are small but pretty. One of the clasps did not close properly and I should have sent them back. Of course, I lost one within two months. Not a good buy!"
4,"Very pretty, but bad clasp","These earrings are very pretty and sparkly medium sized bottom hinged hoops. They measure 5/8 inch in diameter. The diamonds are very small, but glittery. Great earrings for everyday wear. However, as other reviews have mentioned, the clasp is not good. It is very very loose. It is possible to tighten up the clasp somewhat by bending inward the clasp end that the post clicks into using a pair of jewelry pliers. However, I will always be careful while wearing these earrings and check that they are still in place quite frequently.I like these earrings so much that I have ordered another pair as a gift."
3,Ok,"The price was right (got them in a gold box sale) and they are pretty, but the clasp is iffy at best. The clasp doesn't hold tightly no matter what I do, so I imagine I will eventually lose one or both of these earrings. I wear them sparingly because of this."
2,Good but not great especially for $30,"Although the author's passion for Rankin/Bass productions (Rudolph in particular) is very evident, I was a little disappointed that this book really wasn't purely dedicated to the making of the holiday classic which the title would imply. There is a great deal of space dedicated to the voice talents that brought the beloved characters to life but in my opinion not enough dedicated to the ""animagic"" work done on Rudolph. After reading the book I felt the $30 price tag was a bit steep."
2,"Interesting, but somewhat disappointing.","I purchased this book hoping to see some of the magic that made Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer such a wonderful classic. There are a few black and white photos of the actual animation production, which took place in Japan. The book is hard to follow, many different people doing many different things. They say that hardly any photos were taken of the puppets or the sets at the time of production, the animators were facing a deadline.There are some explanations of how the animation came to be that are very nostalgic if you grew up in the sixties."
2,"""glossy"" kansch","The book is beautiful, but not so good to be ranked among the most interesting ones. I as expecting o lot of mountain pictures, and get frustated with very few ones. My copy has a faulty assembly, as the pages are upside down."
2,Worse than 2006,"I am an avid FIFA fan, and have both owned and played every single edition that has been released. FIFA 2006 marked the pinnacle of their games so far, coupling great graphics with realistic gameplay. I have no explanation for what could EA did with 2006 FIFA World Cup. The graphics are worse than they are in 2005, yes 2005. The gameplay is terrible the players move so, and everytime you try a through pass its completed. I would have been much more content if they had taken 2006 and remade all the teams and leagues; but they didn't they took 2002 FIFA World Cup, gave the players first touch, and re-released the same crappy graphics. Do not buy this game. If you are so inclined to play as international teams, FIFA 2006 has an International league. Terrible Game!!"
2,2006 World Of Ants Soccer,Once again EA sports is showing why there soccer game is not cutting the mustard. Every year the game gets worst i think they need to go back to the 2003 game and look how Big the Players are . The presentation of this year's world cup game Sucks . Go back to the 2002 world cup game and see the laser light presentation . The Big problem i have with this game is the Size of the Players. You have to squint your eyes to play the game Why doesnt EA sports give us the a chance to choose are own Camera Angle . Konami's Winning Eleven Series By Far is Better. Bigger Players Better Presentations Fast game play .
2,There must be something better,"This game can be very frustrating. Essentially, if you score the first goal you will win. Your players have easier tackles, cleaner shots, and more possession. If your opponent scores the first goal, tackling becomes next to impossible and pressing is a joke. The soundtrack is wonderful, selection of teams is incomparable, and the British blokes doing play-by-play are wonderful. But if you care for your sanity, stay away. This game is the most frustrating PC game I have ever owned."
4,Great WorldCup experience for PS2,Easy gameplay and great W.C experience for the last PS2 World Cup game made for US. It does however get old after a few rounds of winning the Cup.
1,Fifia world cup 2006 = Bad Game,"It is a disgrace. Fifa do it every year. They release a [...]game and everyone buys it. I can't wait until winning Eleven destroys them in sales. I removed winning eleven eight from my PS2 to try this game, and wow. I was shocked at how bad it was. Don't waste your money! Get winning Eleven!"
2,Better AI PLEASE!,"I don't know how many times a ball has rebounded off the keeper, and one of my non-controlled players just stands there with the ball right in front of him. Or if there's an opponent streaking down the middle, your non-controlled players BACK OFF from him. Even if you switch defense to ""Pressing."" Sometimes, if you are pursuing an opponent, the game automatically switches to a different player, and the guy you WERE controlling suddenly stops running. Monumentally frustrating, and it totally killed my rekindled soccer buzz.Don't know how graphics compare, but I thought they were terrible; you can't see a thing.Nice music, though, especially Ladytron's ""Destroy Everything You Touch."""
2,BAD CAMERA VIEW!!!,"Trust me on this one... everything looks OK... over 100 teams to choose... you can make your own team, player... all kinds of tourament... and World Cup 2006 Match... players are just like in real life... they look same... so everything seems perfect... except... BAD CAMERA VIEW... Camera is so far that... all you see is players' body and a white dot flyng back and fourth(ball)... I tried to zoom in... it only zooms little; there are no difference... all the camera views are almost like Bird's eye view... TRUST ME!!! TRUST ME!!! RENT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF... 2002 World Cup is way better when you think of it... Controls are very very confusing!!! TRUST ME!!! TRUST ME!!! Go look for something else!!!"
2,No better and is REALLLY hard to make a goal,Everytime I play a game its almot impossible to get a goal in.....yeah I know soccer isnt a high scoring game but I mean I can have 20 shots on target in game(lets say I am a really good team like Holland and I am playing a dreadful team like Ghana with a dreadful goalie) and all 20 of those shots are blocked by the goalie. And they are like spectacular saves....its really frustratiing...usually most matches end in a draw. Also this game is no better than any other soccer games of years past. Its about the same as the last World Cup game I played on PS2(4 years ago) in the gmaeplay department(and like others have mentioned graphics arent too hot too)Some nice additions though in terms of extras are global challenge...where you can replay historical moments in Wolrd Cup history and another nice touch is taking a country(pretty good selection of countries) and try and qualify them for the world cup.
1,Absolute Garbage,"Well maybe 1 star is a little harsh, but there is a definitive football game and that is Pro Evolution Soccer (Winning Eleven in the US). It is so much better than any other football game on the market that there is absolutely no point in purchasing anything else, FIFA included.Pros of FIFA - It has full licensing of several world leagues and a huge database of players, also has a heavily licensed soudtrack.Cons of FIFA - It is cr*p compared to Pro Evo in anything that actually matters, for example gameplay, realism, skill etc..Please don't line the evil empire's (EA) pockets with more money for their garbage sports games that they release with a new number on the end every year, buy Pro Evolution (Winning Eleven) for the real football experience."
5,a true Ground-Breaker,Shirley Chisholm truly was a Ground Breaking Soul Sister who made a change. this Documentary shows all the Politics&everything that went down with her 1972 Campaign. there should be a Film&also more determined minds to follow in her shoes because Shirley Chisholm truly was ahead of her time. she was truly one of a Kind.she was like a Modern Day Harriet Tubman meets Dr Martin Luther King Jr all rolled into one. Barbara Jordan made a Impact in DC but we haven't had another Shirley Chisholm&we need that spark now more than ever.
4,Chisholm'72,"I would like to thank the writer, Keith A. Beau for his ability to capture this valuable historical information about Ms. Chisholm and her life encounters during this very critical time. It is ""a keeper"", especially for those who are African American and other nationalities- in search of more Self-awareness and Diversity-awareness."
5,GREAT LTAG GUN!,"When i first bought this gun, it was alot bigger that a thought.But holy cow it is great.First, the larger sending and recieving tubes make it easier to hit without aiming, so you dont always have to aim in a fight.Next, the missle is awesome! It may not work as well as it says, but it still works!Third, the text messaging is sweet! You can tell ur teammates to look certain directions and go places.So overall, this gun gets a 5! ITS DEFINITELEY WORTH THE MONEY!Cheers."
5,Awesome!,This is a really fun TOY IT ROCKS!!!!!!If you like lazertag... BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ITTTTTTT!You can fire a rocket at your opponent. Its like a bazooka gun! You can name your gun and text message another player who has this gun. You will love it!
1,pump missle did not work,"unit works, but the missle does not fire. Probably so old it lost its vaccume. No customer service available since discontinued."
3,Still worth it...probably,"Overall, I like this polish. It applies very easily and has a good color. I did have a problem with the foam applicator, though. It worked very well at first but fell off after a couple of uses. The polish is still usable, but the applicator could have been made a little sturdier."
5,"Not the cheapest shoe polish, but good quality","Gets the job done fairly well. I haven't had problems with the applicator, but it's not exactly a super high quality tool. Cheap cap design, also kind of wasteful as far as packaging is concerned. It would be cool if there were some kind of permanent, reusable applicator and you could buy the actual polish separately.That being said, this is somewhat expensive compared to other kinds of shoe polish, and Amazon isn't exactly giving anyone a huge break on it, either."
1,I did not like this,"I purchased 2 large bags of this broth thinking that I was getting a real deal on vegetarian chicken broth. When I finally opened it, it had a funny smell. If you add salt to it, it tastes OK, but it still has a funny smell. I went back to the McKay's chicken style seasoning."
5,Very Pleased!,keeps the Children's Minds Occupied while they are learning! This makes learning FUN at an early age.
5,Well worth the money,"My kids have a lot of fun with this. They think they're playing a video game, and in the first 10 minutes of play learned about ""silent e."" Definitely well worth the money."
3,Ok but not great,This toy is really cool for older preschoolers and kids learning to spell and read.My 3 yr old got bored very quickly though.
2,Boring!!!!!!,"It's a cheap version of the word whammer. My four year old son loves the word whammer, but is bored with this product. He uses the word whammer for about an hour daily. I can't get him to sit for 30 seconds with this product."
1,It did not work,"I bought this item and when I connected it to my flat screen tv it was in black and white, had no sound and no horizontal hold. I figured it was because the toy was an older model and not compatible with my tv. I tried it on an old television and experienced the same problem. I am returning it."
3,It a good start off tool,"My 4 1/2 year old likes this leapfrog game. He particularly likes that he can try and form his own words. Whether that is good for him or not, I do not know, but he seems to believe that he is doing a great job and I don't believe in discouraging him. He plays with this about once a week. For the price I paid, I think it was a well spent dollar. The only down side to me is the letters. Yes, they are not compatable with the other leapster items (which is not a big deal to me) but they need to put the letters in a cardboard tray for play of this game. That takes the longest and fustrates him the most."
2,Disappointed Educator,"Parents BEWARE!!! Several of the sounds are pronounced INCORRECTLY in ALL of the Leapfrog toys. /r/ is pronounced as /er/ when you say ""robot"" it's not an ""er-bot"". /l/ is pronounced as /ul/ with the schwa+l which is also incorrect. These toys have a great purpose but be prepared to correct your children when they pronounce these sounds the wrong way."
2,Leap Frog Dropped the Ball,"This toy was on sale for $20 and i jumped at the chance, only to be very disappointed. We have enjoyed Leap Frog products in the past and trusted the company name, no more!Our 4 year old has enjoyed the toy but the graphics are very poor quality and ""chunky"" in nature, takes me back to my Atari days. The games are rather simple and boring. As a reward players receive tokens to use to build a theme park roller coaster, once again the graphics are just terrible and the roller coaster can only be built so big before you have to start again.i just can't believe that Leap Frog allowed such a toy to be marketed? The board must have been sleeping the day this was rammed through. It's not a toy that will build their name in learning. It's annoying to adults, frustrating to children and a waste of money.One weak positive, our daughter does enjoy plugging it in and turning it on by herself."
1,Defective,"This product is defective, there are no ""p""'s in it, only ""d""'s. Unfortunately you cannot turn them upside down and switch them around. Will write back when replaced."
1,Big Disappointment!!,"I have been SO pleased with all things Leap Frog until now. I have recommended and given the videos to friends. I credit Letter and Word Factory with teaching my kids to read, but this game is worthless. There is only one game for three letter words, one for four letter words and one for silent E words. But the games are slow and dull. If you put in three letters to make a word it takes at least 10 seconds for that word to ""register"". We tried ""ay"" (ray, hay, pay, say ...)words and the game eventually pronounced a couple of them but seemed not to recognize the others. If it takes 10 seconds and then doesn't even tell you what you spelled every time then what is the point. I tried to play it with 5 different kids and none of us thought it was any fun. This is the first item that I have ever returned to Amazon because of dissatisfaction."
4,Word Launch Review,"I bought this for my age 6 son for his birthday. The first one we received was defective, as the sound directions were absent. Amazon replaced it right away - fantastic customer service. The new one works well. Both my son and daughter enjoy playing with it, and I am amazed how well it has helped my 4-year old daughter learn her alphabet letters. I agree with another reviewer that it would be helpful if the toy would tell the child when he/she has not actually spelled a word. In some of the activities I know my son has believed himself to have spelled a word, when it wasn't. The graphics could perhaps be a little more imaginative in some ways, but the kids like them, the toy has provided good practice, and I do think the ""silent e"" presentation is very memorable to little ones."
4,Cool CD!,This is a really cool cd.. all the best hits all packed in to 2 CD.. it's like non-stop wonderful music to entertain you all night long.. go get it if you love CD with a veriety of artist !
3,An Interesting If Dated Political Comedy,"Unlike the reviewer from Texas I have had no problems playing this DVD it runs fine.The movie like most older comedies doesn't really play funny anymore, if it ever did.That being said it is an interesting time capsule of a largely forgotten Nixon spoof comedy. This curiosity purchase will hold your interest but don't expect to be wowed.Special Features (On the Lucky 13 Cult Collectables DVD):-Letterbox version of the film-Photo Albums containing 125+ production stills-Ads from the theatrical release (1976 - ""The Way He Was"")-Ads from the first theatrical tests (1975 - ""Top Dog"")-Presskit-Bios of key production personnel-Bios of cast members-Newspaper clippings-Reviews-Original screenplay-Original story synopsis-Additional easter eggs"
4,Very Scary and very intriquing,"True or not, Communion tells an excellent story of childhood memories and terrors, which come back to haunt the man later in life. After reading it alone, I found that I couldn't even leave the book face up to look at those large, dark eyes. You will enjoy reading it and wonder, ""Could it be true?"""
3,Communion: A True Story,"I thought It was very well written,and considering how far fetched the story was,I felt it was told it such a way,that the author didn't come off as a crack pot. I don't know if I believe these things actually happened. But,It caused me to leave my comfort zone for a while. And,contemplate this subject. Whether you believe this sort of thing or not. He really believes he experienced these things. And he tells it quite convincingly. Its most definitely worth reading. with an (Open mind)"
5,Reality is changing,"this life experience related here by the author is not only common to him but many other persons all over the world, from all nationalities and social backrounds, including myselfe. It is something so personnal, such a big truth in our selfes, that the fact that it is not acepted by society does not even touches it's foundations of truth inside of you. It doesn't matter because YOU KNOW that it is your reality as much as you have five fingers in your hand. This book will help all those who are starting to become aware that there is more about this living existence of ours that people normaly think to grow into a more universal existence, where love is the engine of all things. Wonderfully fritning and simultaneously beautifull. A must for all those who want to know something more about our reality then it is said to be."
2,Little Content,"The book starts out very well. Whitley gives some good perspectives concerning such bizarre phenomenon throughout. Unfortunately, there's not much more here. It's a lot of babble and little content. I kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. Much of the book is semi-coherent transcripts of hypnosis sessions. It will surely put you to sleep. 2 stars out of five."
1,This book is overrated!,"I bought this book because it's popular and widely known and it's NEW YORK's bestseller...BUT after reading it, i have to say it is highly overrated. It's cool reading about his hypnosis on the abduction but then he went on and on talking about his life and some other craps that have nothing to do w/ the case. Stick w/ the main story and stop going off the wrong way!! I am not interested in your life...i bought the book to read about the ufo abduction not your life or your nonsense lengthy opinion. This guy don't have enough interesting thing to say about the case, so he fill it in w/ his thought about his life...which is hella boring. If you're interested in a UFO's abduction case, read Raymond Fowler's 5 books of the Betty Andreasson. Compare Fowler's books to Communion is like night and day, not even close. In a scale of 1 to 10, Communion is at a low 2 while Raymond Fowler's books are at at high 9 or 10."
1,"bad cover, worse content","I mistakenly bought this book due to the comments and what I had heard about Whitley in an UFO documentary. There may be some kind of extraterrestrial life(a small particle or cell, not Whitley's alien friends) but, what this book tells are nonsense. What kind of sane people may believe all of this rubbish? We almost can't assure the existence of water outside the Earth after many years of investigation and this man tells a story about ET relatives appearing and disappearing almost daily in Earth.Despite its lack of usefulness I have learned something from this book: there is a worrying amount of people who seem to belong to the same group of ""blind believers"". People who need some evidence in order to believe seem to be a nearly to extinction race.I enjoy with somo UFO documentaries but this book is the worst UFO-related story I have ever seen."
3,From Skepticism to Comprehension,"This book is written in almost novel style at the beginning, which led me to become suspicious that it was nothing more than an elaborate dream, further enhanced by the author's obviously excellent writing abilities and imagination. The seemingly bizarre occurrences of the author's experiences were almost enough for me to stop reading and dismiss this as a work of fraud. However, later, as the author explains that he, too, doesn't really understand what happened to him, I realized that his experiences are actually common to most people. Our comprehension levels are simply nowhere near what is necessary for a complete experience."
5,Scared the heck out of me,"I was afraid to read this book and finally I did, it helped me bring back memories of my own abduction as a 4 year old child and also strange things that happened in the same vein when i was 12 years old. It still scares me to death and it seems as Whitley says, there is no escape, if you are marked, they will come after you, and it's no fun being one of the ""chosen."" Also I have personally seen the saucers in the skies on different occasions. Scarey!! How can it be denied?"
2,Hmhm...,"This book for me has two faces, for some time, I enjoyed it like a drug, and then it was difficult for me to even open it... The thing is, for me, when Strieber tells his story, it's like the best book I've ever read, but when he pretends to be some scientist or else, and he tries to look so objectif, it just gets pathetic, unbearable...However, I think people should read the book, but really skip some parts because some have just no sense..."
4,Prepare to be scared...,I've always been fascinated with the possibility of extraterrestrial life and picked this book up because the title and cover art grabbed my attention. I was not disappointed! It shocked me with its implication that we are not alone and that some of us may have been abducted by ET. I've since read several more of Strieber's books and find his writing style and story lines to be plausible and impossible all at the same time. Reading this book was truly an mind-opening experience.
3,Good food for thought,"I found this book among my father's old things and read most of it. It's the first book I've read of this genre (aliens, etc.). Liked: I like his writing style-he creates a sense of mystery and wonder so it's a pleasure to read. I was intrigued by-had never heard before-his idea that perhaps these beings operated like a ""hive"" with much less individuality than we have. Disliked: I couldn't finish reading all of his musings about the history of the meaning of triangles-just too theoretical for my tastes. Despite all the angst of the ""victims"" I would love to have the visitor experience. I'm here guys, er, bug-eyed beings!"
3,Mind or Matter,"* ""Communion delves into one of the questions that may not seem wild. Are there aliens visiting earth and studying human beings? Whitley Strieber discusses an abduction. He opens up the door of the abduction experience to show us two rooms. One is filled with ideas that aliens are visiting some people multiple times to perform all kinds of experiments on them. No one can say what these aliens are doing with the data, but this book gives a vivid picture of the alien collecting of knowledge about human beings. In the other room Strieber shows us the human subconscious or unconscious. We do not use 90% of our brain. What is in those dark regions of unchartered mind area. Communion sets forth a notion that alien abduction could be experiences of acts from our unconscious minds."""
4,Thrilling - A good storey!,"This kept me up late at night. The author is able to show you the recesses of his mind and life and then terrify you (although unintentionally I think). Whether the storey is true or not, it is definately well told and it does get me thinking more about what really might be ""out there"". He covers a lot of ground in this book and he has wetted my appetite to read another few books on this subject."
4,Interesting and well-written,This book chronicles a few events that occurred in the mid-1980s to Whitley and his family. These events lead the author to believe that aliens from space or a phenonenon even more strange was occurring. The events are well-described and the reader is left with the impression that something happened here on some level. His later books trace further happenings and take the reader deeper into the mystery. Mr. Strieber at times reaches a level of poetry in his discriptions of events and his hopes for the future of humankind.
4,Will definitely make you stop and think,"Even if you dont believe in alien abductions, you will question it after reading this. Very riveting and very scarey, at times. You feel for this man and the terror he lives with as he discovers the memories of visits through out his lifetime. You will also feel some compassion for the ""visitors"" themselves and you wonder what exactly they are looking for from us.A great read."
4,creepy!,"Communion was one of the first full length novels I read as a young reader. It was a great read. I remember hiding under the covers, unable to peak out for fear of those eyes looking at me through the darkness. When a bunch of words has that effect, it's a great read. However, I picked it up again after almost twenty years and my skeptic nature made me put it down. As a novel it's a great book, but I think the ""true story"" nature of the sale is a turn off. But then again, I've never had an experience like Whitley Strieber's."
1,Communion,True story?! After reading reviews of this book and many books on the same subject I would have to say that this book is very inconclusive. I suspect that it is some form of enticement to read his fictional stories. One of the most disappointing and non believable stories on this subject that I have read and I am a believer in the extistence of aliens and ufo's!
3,compare and contrast,"I am new to this subject of UFOs and ETs and have recently read 6 books on this subject, including Strieber's. For me,Communion ranks fairly high on a credibility scale, but falls behind the accounts in kt Frankovich's new book; Where Heavens Meet. I would have liked to have seen more detail, description and emotion in Communion, which is Where Heavens Meet blows Communion away."
3,"A fun read, but don't take it too seriously.","I bought and read this book for the same reason that I went with my wife to see ""The Blair Witch Project"": To be scared by something very ominous, eerie and terrifying while at the same time finding security in the knowledge that it is all made up. For the most part, the book did the trick, although I didn't much care for the areas of the book in which Strieber dwells on his transcendental mumbo-jumbo take on alien abductions or whatever. But I suppose he has to make some kind of sense out of it all. He just didn't need to share it with me. The movie is frightening as well and weird at times like this book. But treat the movie and the book the same, as the telling of a ghost story that you can turn the lights on afterwards. Don't go running off across the desert trying to break into Area 51 or Hangar 8 or whatever. Those people will shoot you!"
1,"""Communion"" poorly written","In my humble opinion, ""Communion"" is a cheap, poorly written novel that was a fading novelist's last stab at the best-seller list. And even that is getting a little tired these days with Strieber's rehashing of the genre (as if anyone could believe it's anything other than a genre--Streiber would have you believe this actually happened). And if that isn't bad enough, I found the book to be very poorly written and often times found myself wondering just how difficult can it be to find success in this field if talent is no longer a prerequisite? OK I've said enough. I didn't like it, sorry."
2,Greatest Let-Down Ever!,"Wow... I don't think i've ever been so disappointed in a book. Some books you hear so much about, and how they're out there paving the way for a certain topic, revolutionizing they way we think of something. This book does not deserve any of the above titles.This book is not even the slightest bit believable. At times Strieber himself, admits that he gets confused between what is reality and what is not. At the end of the book he pretty much fails his polygraph test. This book is boring and totally un-credible coming from a fiction writer.To finish, this book is right out boring. Like others stated on here, I kept reading because I just hoped it might pick up. And at about page 275, I lost all hope and skipped to the end. How a book like this ever got such a prestigious title is a complete mystery to me. Don't waste your time on this book."
1,Boring,This book is a chore to read. You keep hoping it will get interesting. It is just poorly written. He rambles and repeats himself as if he really doesn't have enough to say about the subject to fill up a book. His experts are mostly others who also believe in alien abduction so their credibility is shaky in my opinion. It's hard to believe you could make a story about alien abduction boring but this guy has done it. Afterward it is hard to say if this guy is just crazy or a hypochondriac or just a writer who came up with a great idea to sell books.
3,"Interesting, but not compelling","Strieber's book is interesting, but I was certainly not captivated. It was the kind of book in which you read a chapter, then put it down for the day, then pick it up the next day, read another chapter ... leisurely, somewhat entertaining reading. Strieber waxes too poetic in areas, is very redundant in others. Visitors from another world (or from within us, or wherever) are - or rather, can be - a fascinating topic. Did this happen to him and others? I guess I'd like to believe it is possible, but this book did not convince me."
5,Incredibly good,"Frankly, I was shocked to find only 9 reviews of this book. Strieber is THE pioneer in this field, from Communion straight through to Confirmation. Whether you have an interest in aliens or not is really irrelevant. This is one of those must reads that you recommend to your kids precisely because it runs contrary to mainstream thought. And once you (and your kids) read it, you'll probably read all the others. The bottom line is that even if Streiber were writing about weather, he has a beautiful grasp of language and brilliant insight into what is hidden from the rest of us. Trish MacGregor"
4,You WILL Believe. (or at least be thoroughly entertained),"One of my friends, a deep NON-believer in extraterrestrials, told me that she was moved by this harrowing work. Out of mere curiousity I read it. And...it changed me. Most books on the subject of UFO's and extraterrestrials whiz right by me, and I've forget their message within days. However, Communion has stuck with me, and Whitley Strieber's riveting account continuously resurfaces in my mind. But, sadly enough, this book is not for the faint-of-heart. Its bizarre stories and explicit descriptions are downright frightening; I can honestly say that I have lost sleep over this book, lying awake, wondering if it's true. I would not recommend this book before bed. If Strieber's accounts of his alien abduction are true, then this book is more than a nonfiction work: it is undeniable proof that ""they"" do exist. But even if Strieber is lying through his teeth, Communion makes for a highly entertaining read."
4,"""Communion"" is different from any book I've ever read.","What makes this book so stunningly compelling is the fact of the author's doubt with regard to his own plausibility. Again and again, he attempts to assert a sense of neutrality, of scientific objectivity. He doesn't ask that you believe him or disbelieve him, only that you carefully consider what he has to say and to make your own judgement. At times, Streiber's writing has an ethereal quality to it that almost supersedes the amazing message he wants to bring to the world - his descriptions of places he's visited and lived and the things which have happened to him there are not detailed or accurate, but rather told almost unconsciously from the heart, as though he has a desperate wish to place you there himself."
3,Communion - A Mediocre Story,"This is an average book. I'm not a confirmed believer or non believer of aliens. I heard that this book was ""great"" and ""super scary"" and it was fairly average. Certain parts are really interesting and keep you reading. But on other parts I found myslef really skimming just to get through. It was incredily boring. Some parts of the book even bordered on poorly written. Worth a read though if you interested in this sort of thing."
5,Great OEM Replacement,"Replaced my '99 Acura Integra's stock spark plug wires with these. They seem very high quality, the plugs and contact points feel solid and durable. This is my first time using non-OEM ignition components, but so far so good. Though I didn't notice any significant changes in acceleration or startup (and I installed a new distributor cap & rotor at the same time), the blue color does improve the looks of the engine bay. Recommended replacement over stock wires which may cost you an arm and a leg from the stealership ;) (Wish these wires came in red)"
5,Great Book,"This is a great book by a wonderful author. The story is special because of the theme and shows the danger of letting your family run your career. Fortunately, the main character had a lot of courage and trusted the man who really loved her. Way to go!"
3,Nothing special,"This is basically a collection of all the clips on the ""Ike and Tina Turner: Live"" DVD, plus a small five song concert afterwards. So if you have ""Ike and Tina Turner Live"" you may want to re-think purchasing this. The first 9 clips are from a television show with a funky background and not ""in concert,"" only ""live"" it seems. The last five songs are the duo in concert though...it's a pretty good 10 - 15 minute-long concert that includes: Proud Mary, Honky Tony Woman, Respect, You Can Boogie If You Try, and Nutbush. I gave it three stars because of the repeat clips, and I really feel like I paid 12 dollars for 15 minutes worth of music."
2,poor quality knock off,there is a dvd called ike and tina turner Live! thats the same thing as this but better video quality and superior 5.1 sound.
1,Really disappointed,This book is lame. It's black and white drawings are sloppy and they don't instruct. There is little or no instructionsThis book is way over priced. Stay away from it.
1,50 bucks? You have to be kidding!,"I bought this book as a gift. I was stupid enough to throw away the return slip before I realized what I bought. This is a flimsy black and white book that does not show much of any detail. There is nothing from China and Japan and maybe one exaple for every 250 years of history. There are even blank pages throughout the book for no reason. I am still going to give the book because I have nothing else to give but I know the person will be thinking that I""m a cheapskate and will never guess in a million years that I actually spent 50 bucks. I feel like I've been robbed. The reviewer that was the reason I bought the book has obviously only seen one or two books in his/her life."
5,Couldn't have life without Bunny Bear,We bought this little guy as a spare for our 15 month old daughter who simply can't part with Bunny Bear. I am so glad we found it!
4,Excellent and chilling,"Without doing anything except just listing the facts about war such as ""what is your chance of getting killed?"", Chris Hedges has managed to write a very powerful anti-war book. I learned that 98% of soldiers become severely mentally ill after prolonged combat and that most soldiers who die do so from bleeding to death. Chilling."
5,Nice Decal,"This is a nice decal. It is made of good quality material. It is supposed to be removable, but I haven't tried that so I can't comment on that. I have had this on my truck window for over one year and it has not fadded, peeled or had any problems at all. With the California sun beating on it I am most impressed that the color is still good."
4,good recommendations for interesting readings,"I like the book because it recommended several interesting novels to read. I was not too happy with the historical parts (the author missed the fact that Haiti was the first independent African-American country ever!) because the writing was very sketchy. The assumption that a non-hispanic reader needs to be repeatedly told that both Central and South Americas consist of many countries felt rather offensive to me. The author was extremely critical of hispanic mentality (way too critical for a reader like me who is neither hispanic nor anglo), yet he ended the book with a triumphant call to a reconquista, which after all the criticism felt rather strange."
1,Bitter ragings,"This book is perhaps the most blatant use of print media to convey a bitter point I have ever seen. Ilán Stavans spends his time lamenting the mistreatment of various Latin American writers, actors, artists, etc, in a weak attempt to invoke sympathy for the Hispanic cause. I am a spanish major who has had considerable interaction with the hispanic community, and this book unfairly represents most of the hispanics that I know. My class requirements were the only thing that kept me from throwing it in the trash after the first chapter.*This review refers to both the Spanish and English versions.*"
4,Great rancheras y nortenas!,"If this album, Vol. 10 of the ""Asi Canta Mexico"" series, is typical, I want the rest of the series! Lilia Santaella, who directs a school of traditional Mexican music in Durango, belts out these rancheras and boleros rancheras with a strong, clear, passionate voice, accompanied by the Mariachi Arriba Juarez. Some are done in traditional Mariachi-style, others nortena-style with accordion. The selection of songs is great, especially rancheras like ""Los barandales de puente,"" ""Paloma sin nido,"" and ""Mi ranchito."" Santaella's rendition of ""No vuelvo a amar"" is glorious. My only complaint about this CD is that she doesn't do as well with some of the boleros that require a softer touch. I'd like to hear more rancheras sung by her--and I'd love to see her perform."
5,Great for any student of German,"Langenscheidt is always reliable no matter what the language, but, as a German company, you'd expect their German dictionary to be supreme. This one doesn't disappoint. I've lived in Germany and Austria and I can count on one hand the number of times I couldn't find a legitimate word in this dictionary. It even includes such Austrian (i.e. non-standard) words like 'Marille' (apricot) and 'Obers' (cream) and is loaded with phrases I haven't been able to find in any other dictionaries like 'sich um des Kaisers Bart streiten' (to squabble over little things).Besides a 700-page dictionary this book also includes lists of irregular verbs, abbreviations (in German and English), geographical and historical names (also in German and English), musical works and numerals. At the beginning there is a pronounciation guide and in the middle there is a handy weight and measure conversion chart.A necessity for anyone studying German."
2,Not Up To Date,This dictionary is dated 1995 and does not reflect the latest spelling reforms. A new edition is badly needed. I'm returning my copy.
5,The Best German/English Dictionary,"It came quick and was exactly what I need for my German class. I used in high school and now in college, everytime its the book. It came just in time for classes."
3,New German language student is disappointed,"One would expect this massive dictionary to contain EVERY word one could encounter. Unfortunately, conjugations of verbs are not listed. If one does not recognize the word ""gibst"", how is one to know that it is a form of ""geben""? The book should at least list the each form and direct the reader to the infinitive form. I am just learning the language and need this level of detail. I am returning the book."
3,JB's Bell Chrome Deer Warning.,I purchased a set of Bell Chrome Deer Warnings for my Fusion and a set of Black Bell Deer Warnings for my wife's Escape. The quality seems to be what I expected and they blend in with the grills on each vehicle. My only complaint is the strength of the adhesive on the products. I lost one of the Chrome Warnings at the car wash.
2,CHROME may need some help!,the product itself was good and everyone I talked to said the same thing. However they fell off after two days!!! So to say they work or not is not for me to say.And I do know the correct way to install.....!I also purchased a pair in black and those are hanging tough!!!
5,Deer Whistles,Been using them and giving them away for years...wonderful...deer just FREEZE on the side of the road when I go thru!
5,"Save a deer,Save a car!","Usually ,I forget to but deer whistles until after I have hit the deer. This time ,I thought about getting them before it happened. I live in an area over populated with deer ,and it pays off to have a little extra protection.I have had 5 deer accidents without whistles,and so far ,no deer accidents with whistles!"
2,hinges don't last,"The other reviewer who mentions this is spot on: the double hinge is epoxied to the case. It comes off in short order. I epoxied mine back a couple times, but eventually it came off and the hinge pieces went sailing off into the street. Good concept but when the hinge comes off the Treo is no longer really held inside the case--I was lucky but the Treo could also go flying, caseless."
2,Like nails on a chalkboard...,"I don't understand why this book seems so universally beloved--I could barely bring myself to finish it! Although the general storyline was compelling, the format was so predictable (search for poem item in real life, find poem item in dream, move on to the next stanza...) and the Transcendentalist and Concord references so ubiquitious, gratuitous, and downright dull, that only sheer stubborness motivated me to finish the book. Furthermore, the characters were entirely one-dimensional and their dialogue gratingly unnatural. I grew to despise not only Eleanor, Edward, and Freddy, but Thoreau, Emerson, Alcott, and even Jane Langton herself. I don't think the author has a real grasp of who her audience is. I know she certainly isn't writing for me!(For a book that scratches the itch that this book fails to, read The Children of Green Knowe by L.M. Boston--a book that comes as close to perfection as any I've ever read.)"
5,"great book, but don't buy the hardcover edition.","""The Diamond in the Window"" was one of my favorite books when I was a child. In fact, I carried a vivid recollection of the story well into adulthood, and couldn't wait to buy the book for the children of my friends & family. Last Christmas, I decided to splurge on a hardcover edition for one of my favorite eleven-year-olds. I was terribly disappointed to find that the ""hardcover"" book for which I had just paid $18.50 was, in fact, nothing more than the $4.00 paperback glued between cheap red cardboard covers. The front and back of the paperback had been sliced off and pasted onto the new ""hard"" covers. Buy the paperback, and use the money you save to purchase a good copy of ""The Wizard of Oz""."
5,Reliving a childhood memory.,"I was a precocious child. It was still somewhat unusual for a girl-child in the late '50s and early '60s to read science-fiction, but it seemed a natural segue from fairy tales to me. So, at the ripe old age of 8, I was reading Mr. Bass's Planetoid and Heinlein's juvenile novels. ""Diamond"" falls into the realm of urban fantasy. This book, along with ""The Missing Boy"" by Joan Dell (long out of print), and later Madeleine L'Engle's ""Wrinkle In Time"" were read over and over again. They say you can't go back, but good fantasy is timeless, and I am looking forward to a pleasantly nostalgic read. Thank you for making this wonderful book available"
5,A really great book for mystery lovers!,"Ms. Langton dose a great job describing wonderfulyrealistic characters. The story never goes dull andis a bit scary, but more exciting! This book would probablybe best understood and liked by people 9 to 200 years old.Read it!P.S. Jane Langton has written many great books like:THE FRAGILE FLAGTHE FLEDGINGTHE ASTONISHING STEROSCOPETHE SWING IN THE SUMMER HOUSE(Most of her books are about the Hall family in Concord, MA)"
4,"Has LSD-like dream sequences, but in a good way!","This is my second (after ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"") in a series of childhood favorites I'm rereading. Once again, I was absolutely delighted. Set in what appears to be turn-of-the-century Concord, Massachusetts, its dream sequences get a little LSD-like in places, but still, a wonderful book. I had no idea, but author Jane Langton has seven more titles in the series, the Hall Family Chronicles, the most recent one being released in 2008."
5,Fantastic,"I started to read this book in third grade and was prevented from finishing by the school librarian. Having finally found it again in my thirties, it is even better than I remembered. I love the riddles solved in dreams and the references to Transcendentalism that I would not have understood as a child. I especially liked Eddy's palindromes, a really believable character quirk. (For another great palindromist character, read The Poisonwood Bible.) Still captures my imagination, exploring a rambling Victorian house to find hidden treasures."
5,Imagination Abounds!,"This was such a great book, I read it when I was a kid and recently something jogged my memory so I bought it. I read it again and it was still just as great, perhaps even better than when I was a kid. A classic. I'm going to pass it on to my kids!"
2,"Clunky, flimzy",1. This bag is small and get filled up about every 100 feet or less!2. The way this bag attaches it is in front of your feet and gets kicked.3. It falls off4. The handle is very uncomfortable and makes it hard to dump it out.I would NOT recommend it. just cut the grass more often and leave the small clippings on the ground.
3,OK but moves around a bit,This is OK but it is a little wobbly on the mower that I have (Brill 38)I only use it when the grass is deep.
5,Awsome!,Great movie! Great happy story!The music was amazing and the choreography was much better than I had expected!I would definitely recommend this film.
3,Glad dance,Great Movie! The music and dancing are a flashback to the best of musical comedy. If you watch the trailer you haven't seen the best bits yet!!
3,Leading ladies doesn't win the prize,"Unfortunately Leading ladies is a movie with potential which is never realised. The cast are engaging and quite decent actors, but the story doesn't really go anywhere. The production quality of movie is only OK. In some scenes I could barely make out the actors faces. Disappointing that so many lesbian and gay movies don't live up to expectations."
3,Needs more strength,"I purchased these bungee's for my 21' contender. They worked well for the first few days, then the Bungee snapped. Having purchased them as a backup for my regular dock lines. Then one windy day they just couldn't take the pressure. They are rated for only 3k pounds. Would love this product if they made them for heaver boats."
5,Great product,This is perfect if you need to tie your boat to a dock. Very easy to use and durable - no more wrapping a line or tying knots! The bungee gives enough for the waves but still keeps your boat in place.
5,Great for 16-22 footers,"Used 2 of these all last summer, so just got 2 more for this summer. Great way to keep your boat against the dock without too much stress on your cleats or the dock.Try to avoid sharp corners, etc, as these can fray over a short time.I swear by them still though!"
3,A skewed view of an important band,"This odd compilation misses many of the Henderson Orchestra's masterworks (such as the 1926 Fats Waller collaborations and the classic 1929 Benny Carter arrangements) while including an overly large helping of bland pop tunes (""My Pretty Girl,"" ""Oh, It Looks Like Rain"") or unfortunate attempts to re-create white dixieland-style jazz (""Sensation""). If you a want a quick, cheap, and somewhat skewed introduction to Fletcher Henderson, this will do. But serious listeners will be much better served by CBS/Sony's classic boxed set, ""A Study in Frustration,"" which remains the definitive Henderson collection."
2,"Great music, lousy sound","The most important thing when you buy recordings of the great bands of the 1920s - 1940s is that the engineers give you the sound that is in the grooves. Unfortunately, many are so interested in cleaning the dirt that they erase the higher frequencies. This recording is an example. The result is a muted and archaic sound. If you want a CD of Fletcher Henderson that will knock your socks off, you can get many of the same tracks on ""Tidal Wave"". On Tidal Wave, you can't believe the 1930s recording sounds so good and vibrant. It rocks. It rips. It'll jazz you."
1,Never received!,I never received this. I cancelled the order for the camera but was not able to cancel this order. I was charged on my visa. I would like my visa credited. Thanks
1,insurance refund,Since I need the camera for work and will need to get it sooner than Amaizon can send can I get a refund on the insurance that I won't be able to use?The insurance was dated for 3/5/07 the camera isn't going to be mailed until June.
1,read the terms and condition pdf,"I bought this thinking ""Failures due to normal wear and tear"", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping. However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT,"" is not covered. This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty. A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered. Save your money."
1,4 year service plan,"I never did receive the certificate that was supposed to be shipped to me in 7-10 days. Insurance is one of those things you buy and hope you'll never use. I guess if I need it I have copies of the recipt showing I paid for the 4-year service plan, but there is no excuse for not shipping the promised certificate."
1,Don't buy this,"I was about to purchase a 2-year contract and have just read all the reviews for that and this one. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS WARRANTY----from all comments from people who have looked closely at the contract and those who have had to use it, the contract is NOT REPRESENTED ACCURATELY on Amazon's page AND the customer service from the company is terrible."
1,Danger! Danger!,"Bought this and still no contract from them after 6 weeks despite e-mails and phone calls. They are not polite on the phone. They are not helpful. Most importantly, based on their behavior to date, they are not reliable.There are other extended service contracts available from Amazon sellers that are polite and helpful. I suspect they will be much more reliable than this company. Some of these other contracts are even underwritten with top rated A.M. Best and Moody companies (Not this contract though, based on a call to them).My advice would be run from this company and shop elsewhere."
2,buy with visa / mastercard..,Just a tip:If you read the fine print on most credit card agreements you will find that they will often extend the warranty coverage on most things at no additional cost IF YOU PURCHASE WITH THE CARD.
3,Service Plan,"Have not had to use this product, but feel it would meet expectations if needed. I would give it a higher rating if I had needed to use it and it worked out."
5,"If you read only one book in 1998, this should be it.","If you read only one book in 1998, this should be it."
5,rough translation of P Alvarez,"One of the best recordings of Hesperion XX (now Hesperion XXI), and the Chapel Reial de Catalunya; and in fact one of the best recordings of the music of Victory. Hesperion XX maintains the spirituality and religiosity of the works in a skillful way. The musicians and singers here are all true virtuosos. Maestro Savall is musicology in his perfection, especially in a difficult recording like this, thank you very much to the Savall teacher and his musicians...."
3,"Good book, with good practical excercises but...","This is a good book which is a good reference for me. However, when I got the book and was working through some of the real world exercises. I wanted to download the files that are referenced by the book for the excercises. This is because the book explains more things related to the files than are in the snippets in the book. Anyway, I went to the site referenced and I am continuously getting the page of Death ""page can not be displayed"". Needless to say I am left wanting."
1,Am I interested,"Am I interested in what the author thought of the album, or what LPs his brother bought?"
2,Lost On Main Street,"Exile On Main Street is arguably the Rolling Stones greatest work. A double album consisting of down and dirty, bluesy songs about the decadence the band was spiraling down into. They were drinking heavily and doing alot of the drugs and the music mirrored their state of mind. John Perry does alot of writing about the band, but seemingly glosses over the album itself. Normally the books in this series are superb, but unfortunately this one does not live up to the other volumes or the album it covers."
3,MODEST BOOK ABOUT PERFORMANCE,"This book is a fairly decent book about performance issues and is perfect for the beginner to the world of sys admininistration. However, as an experienced admin I found 85% of the material redundant or just plain common sense. The routine commands and compilation methods are geared to the begginer. There are few case studies and the ones listed were quite bland. The layout of the book was excellent though. Recommend to any one who is a beginner or who has not taken a performance tuning class. Joe Holbrook, CET, CNST Certified HP Technical Proffesional"
2,This book is mainly about the period after 1740.,"The title of the book is quite misleading. About 85 % of the book is on the period after 1740. About half of the book is about Franz-Josef's reign. The author's mainly cared about 'liberal' reform and concentrates on this throughout the entire book. I think that this is why he didn't give much space to the early Habsburgs, because they weren't envolved in liberal reform. The other main problem with the book is that it isn't clearly written. Someone who doesn't know the history of the times will have difficulties following the book. The format of the book is that it discusses the political, social, and cultural histories of each period. This book, which has a similar format to J. J. Freehan's German History 1770-1866, is certainly not on the same caliber."
2,A great cure for insomnia!,"A history of the Habsburg Empire is full of interesting stuff, and Professor Kann is very knowledgeable on this subject of Austrian history. However he fails to hold this readers attention for long due to his grammer, and seems to go off in tangents. He seems to dig deep into some subjects while bearly scratching the surface on others. Dryness of the book fades away as he goes to the events leading to World War I. This book also gives insight for those wishing to understand Balken history. Overall a decent book but still leaves the reader unfullfiled and looking or another source. I guess I will have to wait for the ""dummies"" edition to come out!!!"
3,a bit of a slog,"I was a History major in college. Though fascinated by the subject matter, I kept thinking that this was a complex topic made more difficult than need be. It makes one pine for the likes of B.Tuchmann or W. Bruce Lincoln or L.S. Stavrianos. If I can find a more readable work, I will buy it........otherwise, back to the slog!"
3,Habsburgs research on the Great Siege,"I am a history major at Indiana State University. In my spring term, I used the book (as one of my sources) for my research paper on the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. I will agree that this particular book is not the greatest reading in the world, but generally historians write books for historians. Also, I will agree with other reviewers that the book's title is misleading because it does not focus on the 16th century compared to others. The book was used in my research to help explain the rivilary between Charles V of Spain (the Holy Roman Emperor) and Francis I (King of France). The cause of the rivals were not because of the grudge with Charles V winning the election for the Holy Roman Emperor or Francis I imprisonment in 1525, but Francis saw the danger of the Habsburg Empire surrounding France.I will recommend this book for people needing information on the Habsburgs for research and to get it at your library or buy an used copy."
1,History is killed in another boring text,"This text is not a good history text. Any good text book will make the subject come alive, this book kills it. It is, however, extremely informative, if you can get through the introduction without dieing. NOT recommended for anyone who is not a post grad! (and even then, only if required for a class)."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,I bought these as a Christmas gift for my son. He thinks the pants are absolutely fantastic. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.
3,"Doesn't stand up to ""The Catalog""","I've been a fan of ""The Catalog Of Cool"" since it was first published. Somewhere between a hipster textbook and a swinger's bible, this book was emminently re-readable and footnote worthy. While I got a good deal on this follow up, I was disappointed that it seems to take itself too seriously and it doesn't touch on the aesthetics of cool at all. Maybe they figured they covered ""the look"" in the first book, but without touching on ""cool threads"" and the personal style ( grooming & accessories ) that goes with 'em, this book ranks 3 stars at best."
2,Very confusing on how to work this item,I still don't use this item because it is too hard to understand and work correctly. I am sure it is just me but can not work things correctly
1,Look elsewhere,"Bought these to watch tv at night while my wife sleeps. Connection is easy, right, but the headphones keep losing signal (8 feet away). The buttons for tunning are noisy (clicking type). They headphones are also bulky."
2,The batteries in the pod are troublesome to get to,"The pod should be across the room, yet the switch to stop the batteries from draining each day is troublesome to get to. We have stoped using the product."
1,Made cheeply,THis thing isnt good at allMine broke after a month - the battery still drain even when powered offRight ear went out after a mouth ( im deaf in my left )- it didn't work more then 2 feet AND if you tipped it a bit it would lose signal
2,You Get What You Pay for,"I didn't want to spend a lot on this kind of item so I opted for a $20.00 headphone and though I don't really know what a more expensive set would have been, this one, once I got help from someone at their company to finally get it operating, has a hum unless you sit very still and set it up very carefully. Not great, though I still might not opt for more expensive as this serves my needs for now."
5,GREAT,"ok these headphones are good sound is CLEAR wireless is NICE to have if you don't like wired headphone but still a very good producted good for TV really good for game consoles at night.the radio in these headphone are NOT really the BEST but still you could always turn the radio on and listen to it......radio in a par of headphones isn't the BEST can't find a par of headphones that play radio very good but oooh well at least you can hear the MUSIC very good and 5-1 for the price is awesome try finding a par that has wireless, built in radio, plays with CD DVD players PC TV and game consoles it took 15 minutes to hook up and i'm now listening to MUSIC on my PS3....... ooooh yeah the headphones also has a built in microphone for PC."
4,Brahm's German Requiem,"Brahm's German Requiem doesn't follow Mozart's or Verdi's Catholic Requiem Mass tradition. It doesn't have a Dies Irae. Although perhaps the 2nd movement, 'For all flesh is as grass', is a kind of Dies Irae - with its haunting melody, and its existentialist truth is conveyed in both the music and words. I think that the 2nd movement was my favourite out of the whole Requiem. I think that Simon Rattle's interpretation, the Berliner Philharmoniker, the Rundfunkchor of Berlin, and the soloists, Thomas Quasthoff and Dorothea Roschmann all give a very good performance of this Requiem."
4,A wonderful Requiem,This was the first time Ive heard the Brahms on its entirety and it was wonderful! The dynamic contrasts and phrasing were masterful. I have been able to use this recording to learn the German text.
4,As good as can be,Almost perfect performance. Ranks with the very best ever recorded. But the most perfect is still being awaited
1,Another disaster by this team,"It pains me to have to spend time to give another bad review to Rattle, BPO and (mostly) EMI. Having heard many (and much cheaper) Requiems, why would any bother with this?1) Rattle's conducting? Boring, no contrasts, no emotion, no anger! The last movement is too rushed, the pause between the overwhelming 5th movement and the 6th is too short.2) The choral singing? Incredibly lame.3) The digital recording: Terrible! Blurred, blended, no depth, no range.5) Production? EMI has hardly done anything good in the last ten years. Seems to me is merely there for the money, not the vision or the art anymore.4) Soloists? Well, OK ... but, what's left? A total waste of my money. Rattle and EMI seem to deserve each other fully.Go to history: it's so much better... and the sound too!"
4,Fun for Foodies,"I gave this set of post cards to my daughter who is going to culinary school. It was an instant hit. She mailed thank you notes with a few, hung a series up in her dorm room, and is saving some for later use. I combined this gift with the calendar. Joost Elffers has a magical way with food. I find myself in the produce section noticing fruits that smile or a vegetable that looks like an animal. It's fun!"
5,Extang BlackMax - its just a Great purchase!,"This tonneau cover came exactly as described, in new condition and with everything needed. Just make sure you order the right model for your truck dimensions, which you can look up on the Extang website. Setup was easy, no tools needed...installed in anout 10 minutes. The BlackMax is nice, low profile, all black, perfect choice for someone just wanting to put a cover on the pickup."
4,Picture doesn't match what the item looks like,"This is a tiny face plate that completely replaces the factory face plate that comes with the micro, not what's pictured. My kids love it because they can completely customize their micro without stickers. It comes with a tool that is supposed to detach the face plate, but it broke immediately. I had to figure out how to bootleg it off--not difficult at all. I don't know about durability or scratch resistance on the screen, but we still have the original to put back on if things get too ugly."
5,APB is AMAZING!!!,"This CD is one of the best that I've heard in a while, I'm biased, because I LOVE Dispatch, but I think their music can appeal to almost anyone. Their music is incredibly diverse, ranging from funk, rock, reggae, jam bands, african drum beats, mellow guitar licks, and all in between. AND, as well as getting two 70+ min CDs, All Points Bulletin comes with a DVD documenting and showing Dispatch's last concert, a free show that made indie music history with over 100,000 people at the Hatch Shell in Boston. Everything about this CD is great... Check it out, I guarantee it'll be a favorite."
5,I bought it for the Phil Keaggy portions,"Well unlike most of the reviewers, I was not familiar with Dispatch. I bought this set for a rare glimpse of Phil Keaggy playing electric in a live setting. That alone is worth the price of admission. Some wonderful moments. Dispatch was generous in the time they gave Phil to go off on his tangents. The energy those guys created was something to behold."
2,Blue Paint Stains Badly,"We've enjoyed buying other paints from Alex for our daughter, but this set had two major drawbacks. The large plastic ""case"" is awkward and takes up way too much space--making it hard to work on her play table. It also tends to spill out when being moved, causing mess after mess. And, we discovered, to our chagrin that one of the blue paints simply does not wash out, ruining our daughter's dress. We've never had a problem with washing things out before, even if some paints took a lot of extra prep to get out.I wouldn't buy this again for those two reasons--stains and awkward packaging."
3,Severely cut,"I completely missed the first disc buried behind paper and thought I only had half the opera so be forewarned there IS a disc on each side. The music is lovely and charming but not the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. The performers are terrific, particularly the rustic players and Puck, the costumes witty and the Royals particularly stunning all in gold, but the minimal sets left even me wanting more, clever and witty though they may have been. Hopefully, the entire work is on the other dvd."
3,The Meek shall Incorporate,"This book is best used to help you decide whether to incorporate your business. Most of it covers how to document your corporation's actions to keep it legal.It will not be very helpful for larger corporations because it goes into little to no detail about the more complicated issues such as selling stock and tax benefits.This is a good book to break the ice for people who are scared off by technical terms, but if you do decide to incorporate, you should plan on buying a book that covers additional topics, such as ""Inc. Yourself."" Likewise if this book is too complicated for you, it is a good indication that incorporation may not be the right choice for you because I doubt that you will find another book that will make it simpler to understand."
3,Basic overview,This book Incorporating Your business for Dummies is a basic general overview of types of corporations and functions. It goes into basic specifics.
3,Okay as a primer,"Incorporating your business for Dummies is okay if you are brand new and know nothing about incoporating or business. It does offer some good, but very basic advice.Two better books are Inc. Yourself: How To Profit By Setting Up Your Own Corporation by Judith McQuown and Form Your Own Corporation and Launch a Business in Any State by J.W. Dicks. Another good read is Inc. and Grow Rich by C.W. Allen et all.With Incorporating your business for dummies, you would be better off borrowing it FREE from your local library. It's really very basic stuff here."
4,"Good as a starter, but you will need more.","Inc for Dummies is not just for dummies, it is a good book on How To Incorporate, but you will need more.Some additional books icnlude How To Incorporate: A Handbook for Entrpreneurs and Professionals by Michael R. Diamond. How To Incorporate in Any State: Everything You Need to Form a Corporation by W. Dean Brown. S- Corporations by Robert Cooke.Form Your Own Corporation and Launch a Business in Any State and The Small Business Kit by J.W. Dicks.Use the dummies book as a starter guide. Use the other books for the real meaty information. Be careful what you buy, the marketplace is proliferated with books by self proclaimed experts who read a lot but have no real world experience."
2,just the tip of the iceberg,"In order to maintain the legal status of your corporation, you need to pass very specific resolutions and keep very specific records. I had hoped for a ""cookbook"" for the legal steps required to set up and operate my corporation, but this is not it.The info on corporate structures is very basic and general - you could easily find this level of detail on the web. That's my primary complaint with this book... it mentions what you must do, but doesn't give you the specifics of how.Instead of this book, I recommend you:(1) Get the *basics* from your lawyer or accountant (or even doing some research on the web)(2) buy The Corporate Minutes Book by Anothony Mancuso instead of this book!"
3,Inc.ed myself,After reading through this book several times I would have to agree with Donna Knight. This book covers only the basic corporation set up and documention. At times it seams like an add for The Company Corporations services. Make sure you reveiw all 34 pages to see if this book has what your looking for. I would recommend Inc.Yourself by Judith H. McQuown. It goes it to more detail on tax strategies.
5,"Simply, I Love IT!!","Over the years, I have purchased so many (first) albums and CDs in order to get a collection of favorites this complete. This CD has the most complete collection of Satchmo favorites I have ever found. One of the things I like is that when the producers remastered the recordings to cut the CD, they left a lot of the qualities of the old-time, original static recordings. There is something comforting about that nearly scratchy quality, even while playing it in my car in the 21st century!!"
4,You gotta love Satch,"This CD is for true Louis Armstrong lovers. There are A LOT of songs on here, and most of the ones in the beginning are OLD, scratchy recordings. That didn't bother me, but if you're looking for a simple ""Best of"" CD, this may not be the right one for you. I like jazz and and I like the CD, but check it out before you buy it to make sure it's really what you want."
4,Louis the Entertainer,"It's often hard to fathom Burns' selection process. His Ellington collection offers up too much material from the 20s and 30s to represent the genius of Ellington's later career, making it less an introduction for the general fan than a convenient collection for the scholar. The Armstrong collection, on the other hand, provides ample illustration of the well-known entertainer-persona of the later years but omits some essential moments from the artistry of the earlier years. Louis' solo on ""Big Butter and Egg Man"" is not only a construction of inspired melodic invention but very possibly the first distinguished jazz solo on record. I wouldn't exchange it for Blueberry Hill, Mack the Knife, Hello Dolly, and What a Wonderful World combined! In short, this is a collection for the undiscriminating Armstrong fan and, in many respects, a better ""introduction"" than is the Ellington collection."
5,Good basic intro to Satch,"This is a good basic overall view of the great legend Louis Daniel Armstrong. It begins with his very first record ""Chimes Blues"" (1923) with the King Oliver Band. He doesn't sing yet, but you can easily tell its him on the Cornet. Among other delights are ""Heebie Jeebies"" (1926), which is as joyful today as it was when it was released (Contrary to popular belief, this wasn't the first scat record-Bert Williams used crazy nonsense syllables 20 years earlier with George Walker in ""My Little Zulu Babe"" and ""Pretty Desdamone,"" but I digress), West End Blues,"" which can be considered a soundtrack to its era, some Hoagy Carmicheal chestnuts such as ""Rockin Chair"" and ""Lazy River,"" and his best known later tunes ""Hello Dolly"" (which knocked out the Beatles from #1 on the Billboard charts in 1964) and the tune most younger people know him for today, ""What a Wonderful World.""Anyone who hates this Cd probably also hates Santa Claus, sunsets, and the 4th of July."
2,Glad I bought after discount,Materials are not of good quality. The ball is still in tact but no longer round; more of a flat oval shape so it doesn't roll anymore.
2,Its really Elizabeth on the cover,What will Elizabeth do when her identical twin sister Jessica is late for a tv appearance(that she was chosen for)because she has been framed for theft!!!!!?
2,"A Worldcom diatribe, with a few useful tidbits","Approximately 75% of this book is an eloquent rant about how the author lost his shirt on Worldcom. The remainder has some interesting takes on the stock market from a mathematical and statistical sense, and touches on a little game theory. An interesting read, but the book has little substance that could not be found elsewhere. Nice cover art, though."
2,Unsatisfying melange,"An odd book. Jaunty style, framed by (a) the author's investment experience, contains (b) a variety of math topics related to the stock market, mixed with (c) brief accounts of classic (prisoners dilemma, regression effect) and recently fashionable (power laws, Parrondo's rachet) topics in mathematical probability. Perhaps a decent read if you haven't read anything else, but this material is covered much better by (a) TalebFooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, (b) MalkielA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, Ninth Editionand (c) PetersonThe Jungles of Randomness: A Mathematical Safari."
2,A Mathematician Becomes Emotional,"I had hoped this book would show how mathematics can be applied to the stock market, but this it does not! Instead, the reader comes away with the insight that also mathematicians can become emotional and therefore commit the usual mistakes in investing activities. Big deal! The chapter on technical analysis was a disaster. I am far from convinced that any technical analysis can make profits consistenly, but I know enough about different methods to realize that the author has little knowledge about the subject.I rate it two stars because of the humour and self-critique it entails. Here, the author shares his shortcomings with the reader, and we can all smile in recognition of our own follies.After all, the author does confess that he wrote the book to make some money to cover his losses in the stock market."
3,'Killing us sloppily '- -error in chapter 1,"At the end of chapter 1, the author devotes two pages to describe a hypothetical situation where the wives of a village are required to kill their husband if he is found cheating. Trouble is that no one tells the wives that THEIR husband cheats.However, the author continues the situation till the point where a cheated wife should realise that HER husband is also a cheat. Then the author makes the error of presuming that the wife knows what the author and readers know. This is incorrect, and what should actually happen is that every wife in the village would ritually kill her husband."
3,Somewhat superficial and lacking detail,"I didn't like this book. Mostly it is a rehash of other books on bahavioural finance and so forth. If you are reasonably well read on finance you are likely to get very little from this one. On eht other hand if you know very little about the topic and are after some intellectual entertainment this book may be just what you are after.The topics are all covered very briefly, and those which I had not come across before were difficult to follow due to the terseness of the coverage.I also got the impression that he hadn't really covered the literature in his research e.g. in the material on power laws.Personally I didn't like his sense of humour but your mileage may vary."
2,Interesting but not useful,"This book is best at discussing some interesting aspects of the stock market, but little to help one make money. I discourage those new to investing from reading this book, as there are many far more useful books for that audience. Paulos matches some well known ideas from game theory with the stock market to provide entertaining reading - rather than informative reading.Keep in mind, Paulos frequently references his own poor performance as an investor, so don't expect to gain any great money making insight."
4,intelligence vs pragmatism,"This book demonstrates once more a truth many people doesn't want to admit: too many intelligent people as the author, are frequently invalidated by his own capacity of being aware of problems and shades a more elementary mind is unable to understand, but that paradoxically enables them to act promptly because these people doesn't see the many possible dangers his decisions convey. And a fast decision is necessary many times because although wrong, that can be better than no one decision.So, no wonder big businessmen, presidents and powerful people use, I think, to have a simple mind in the whole world. Otherwise they should be unable to take action.And stock market requires instinct and decision perhaps more tan a deep mathematic knowledge. No wonder if Paulos has lost in his investment. His abilities are others."
4,Paulos is always a fun read,"I enjoy any book by Paulos, and this is no exception. He is a fun read, especially if you enjoy probability."
2,Stunk,"Although it had some good parts (hence the 2 stars), it was very bad overall. Most of the book was garbage that consisted of applying theories of finance and psychology to why he lost money on WorldCom and to use those theories to justify his losses, almost saying ""it wasn't my fault, look at rule 6, thats why I lost money"". If you want to learn about the stockmarket, I wouldn't reccommend you do it from someone who bought worldcom (and WCOM options outright)all the way down, only a few years ago!"
2,light reading no substance,"If you know only a little mathematics and less about the market you too could write a book at this elementry level. Perhaps the title should have been ""A mathematician recoups his loss from worldcom by selling his story"". A better book that covers much of the same ground is Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life by Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
2,Not really original,"Started slow, but unfortunately did not get better. I gave up at chapter 6 of 9. Like watching a bad movie hoping for it to get better... I was not familiar with the author but was hoping it was going to have a Malcom Gladwell style of writing and content judging by the cover but was disappointed.The running ""gag' of the pouring good money after bad in buying WorldCom repeatedly wore thin after chapter 3. I am not a mathematician but put my foray into this stock purchase as a slap in the face for an uneducated greedy investor and I got what I deserved. At least this was a small percentage of my trading capital. The issue of compound interest has been covered by Motely Fool over a decade ago the the guide to calls and puts can be found in any trading 101 book. Disappointing"
1,a mathematician tries to recoup his losses,Pathetic whining about his losses in WorldCom.He is trying to recoup his losses by convincinginnocent readers to buy his book - much of whichis old ground better covered by Malkiel and others.
2,"Not markets, not math!","I love mathematics and the financial markets, but I thing in this book neither of these topics were developed enough. I don't know how good mathematician the author is, but markets therms he is not experienced enough. Maybe he only bought Worldcom...To many awkward words; I had to used the dictionary too often.I don't recommend it."
1,Buyer beware,Demonstrates the only way to make money from the stock market is to convince someone else you know something about it.The book is simply the story of someone who lost money in the stock market. It is filled with the type of unsupported statements that would be laughed out of a mathematics paper. The book is neither clever nor mathematically rigorous.
5,"Well written, witty",I enjoyed reading this book. The information was presented in a way that the non-mathematically inclined person can understand.
3,"Sturdy toy, but no ""race""","I meant to order a toy that raced two cars at the same time (I think maxim makes one). This toy has only one track, so it's not really a race. My kids still play with it, but I wish I'd ordered the 2 car version."
3,Good Cheap Server Board,"I brought this board a couple years ago for my file server. Works good but was pictured with a SCSI controller chip onboard but did not come with one. I already had SCSI drives, so I had to add a SCSI controller card in the only PCI slot on board. Also there are no USB-2.0 connectors onboard."
2,Eileen Gray,"Not Recommended.Book contains some pictures of original pieces by Eileen; but other than that, the biography is brief and uninformative, also some of Eileen's rare furnitures are not shown."
1,Expect Everything Less.,"I was trying to find a manual (inexpensive being the reason for manual) treadmill that I could use in my living room to run or at least walk on while I was watching television. This turned out not to be the one. Running in nearly impossible because you have to hold onto the bars for stability, and even walking is awkward because the flywheel does not do a good job of keeping the belt at a steady speed. While the build quality is everything you would expect from the hundred and some price range (low), in my opinion this treadmill is unusable. I would strongly recommend not buying this product, even for just walkers."
1,Not happy at all. Sorry I bought it.,"The quality was very poor, and the only reason I did not return it was because I did not want to go through the hasle. :-("
5,TREADMILL,I like the tread mill. It is easy to step on. The belt is flexible enough so it moves easy when you walk.
2,Disappointed,"Difficult to put together. Parts broken (cracked, chipped) and missing. Wiring for meter broken when received! Overall very disappointed in the quality of the product!"
4,Cory Everson Manual Treadmill,"I am very pleased with this product. I needed a quiet way to exercise daily at home, and this is perfect. The assembly was simple. Although it arrived without the instruction manual, the manufacturer responded quickly to my email. All in all, this seems like the ideal solution for those who need a simple workout and don't want to pay gym fees or have bulky machines at home."
2,Not for Beginners,"I have had my treadmill for about 3 months. I did not know what to expect with a manual. I was previously walking outside for about an hour or using an automated treamill, elevated and at a pretty good clip for at least 45-60 minutes at the gym. I was surprized how stiff and difficult this was to use. I am 63 and in pretty good shape. I weigh 150 pounds and am 5' 7"" tall. I can use this treadmill for only about 4-5 minutes and then have to change to sit-ups, Nordic Trac or my Total Gym for a while and then go back to this treamill. It is definatley a great workout but not for beginners!"
5,Perfect Blog for Sports Fans,"I got this blog for kinde, and it was better than the other blogs I had. It gives many updates throughout the day and has more articles than any other sports publication. Great blog."
1,Outdated and worthless. Do not buy this book,"This book must have been written many years ago. I looked through out the book for a publication date but couldn't find one. Perhaps they don't want to let you know how OUTDATED the information is. There have been so many changes at Whistler that the guide is absolutely worthless! Hotel names have changed not to mention their star ratings. The book mentions Whistler is trying to get the 2010 Olympics and they've been elected to host the 2010 Olympics for years. With them hosting the next Winter Olympics, you would think Frommer's would have this book updated. I do NOT recommend to buy this book."
5,Well Filtered Collection,"The key factor in choosing this CD over other Goodman collections is the emphasis on JAZZ. Goodman recorded a lot of if not bland, then certainly restrained commercial material in his quest for broad appeal. This has lead to the false belief by some that he lacked the ability to play with the loose emotionalism that characterize the best jazz playing. This collection should help dispel that idea, covering everything from his early, more fervent clarinet playing to his brilliance as a leader on complex, modern arrangements. Chronologically programmed, the set is still carefully varied and sequenced to play well when listening straight through. Not a dull cut in the bunch. Remastering sound quality is very good, although I've heard a little better on some Columbia reissues."
4,Nice Mix,I have many Benny Goodman cd's and I think this one is the easiest to listen to all the way through without skipping ahead to the next song or whatever. It's a nice flow and all well chosen songs. Very nice.
2,"Ok, but if you cook at all, not real helpful","I cook a lot and after understanding the Hay diet found no reason I could not come up with better recipes. The dressings section was good but I found the rest to be pretty basic. Several recipes for steamed veggies, no need to tell me to add califlower and steam..."
1,Does NOT perform as billed,"The sole reason I purchased this item was because I had a Region 2 (England) DVD I needed to show to my class. This player bills itself as being adjustable to any DVD format. This is simply not true. Despite hours on the phone with customer service over multiple days, it still could not be shifted to play anything except US-formatted DVDs. To top it all off, when the drama was finally over and it was determined that the player was useless for my purpose, I'd had it over 30 days and the Amazon-supported company it came from wouldn't allow it to be returned. Beware of this COBY product."
1,Completely useless product,"I have seen countless positive reviews for this product and I was looking forward to trying it out. Although I was unimpressed at first use, I wanted to wait to review until I had finished the jar. I thought that perhaps the benefits of the product would grow over time.The product was greasy (no surprise, and not a problem if it works) and its odor is fairly unpleasant. Not a really big deal, but EM did not help with skin irritation, rashes, or even basic dry skin (elbows, hands & feet). I have no chronic skin issues and I wonder how someone with real skin issues would view this product.It contains ingredients one can find in countless products in any health food store for a much more reasonable price. It does not even work as a hair pomade. I found it a waste of money."
3,Well at least I can say I've tried it.,"Ok, after all the rave reviews I've read online I finally decided to fork out the $28 bucks PLUS OVER PRICED SHIPPING for this little jar of miracle. A miracle I'm not sure I've seen as of yet. It does make a nice moisturizer but then again so does pure shea butter (much cheaper) and this ""pom stuff"" I found on ebay. Granted, what I bought on ebay cost nearly as much but I find myself going to it much more often (it really does fade freckles, moles & scars too!). Mainly I use this for a lip balm, it is good for that. Uhem, can we say ""bonnie bell""? There are other ""natural"" beauty sources out there that are far cheaper and/or just plain work better. As of right now I can't say I'd ever buy this stuff again."
1,Slow and incomprehensible,"Stewart is capable of evocative description, using uncommon words. He also incorporates the argot of sailing into his tale. This fantasy work tells the story of an island people in conflict with a land people with a mix-in of ghosts and heroes. In actuality the plot line is often obscure. Excessive use of dialog makes the story drag. In fact, I gave up after page 136. The writing is picturesque but the plot is slow-moving and obscure."
1,"No action, shallow characterization, poor writing","Sean Stewart is a talented writer, and his novel Nobody's Son is excellent. Cloud's End is therefore more of a disappointment. The action is very slow. Nothing much happens. All the characters seem indistinguishable from each other. Very dull reading, with no rewards."
1,Unreadable,"I had to read this book for a book group. I found it unreadable. It seemed like it was written by someone in high school who would be better destined to be butcher. I picked it up several times and truly wanted to finish because of my book group, but I could not go further than page 75 before totally giving up on the book. Although the five other members of my group did finish reading the book and said that they enjoyed it, we spent time in the group pointing out some of the particulary badly written passages."
1,dissapointing,"I was deeply frustrated, by the quality of paper, the poor print quality, lack of sharpness of colors and the fact that, the great majority of the plates are in black and white. I felt deceived..."
1,This case does not fit the guitar it was made for,The case was cut incorrectly and does not fit the guitar. I corresponded directly with Luna Guitars on this matter and they sent me a Dean case because they checked and all of the Andromeda cases were incorrectly cut. This was over a year ago and I recently checked back to see if I could finally get an Andromeda case. They checked again and they still have the same non-fitting cases. And this guitar model has been discontinued so it is unlikely that they will ever get replacement cases. I love Luna Guitars but was very disappointed that they didn't correct the Andromeda case problem. This was especially disappointing since I have their acoustic case and it fits like a glove.
4,All Natural Aloe,This product was exactly what I was looking for: aloe vera without any cancer-causing preservatives (according to [...]). The gel consistency is adequate and the scent is pretty agreeable.
5,"Fantastic, even on bug bites.","I got this product for dry skin areas and I have found that it even works great on mosquito bits, making the itch go away in minutes. I also love that a little of it goes such a long way. It works great on sunburn too, I'll have to try some in my hair as others have mentioned sometime."
3,"Works fine, but contains questionable ingredients","The product works well on sunburns. Much less sticky than Fruit of The Earth 100% aloe products. With that said, contains carbopol, a synthetic thickener, two preservatives, and a caprylyl glycol as a emollient."
1,really?,"I like to do crafts sometimes, but this is just creapy judges judging creepy craft projects made with bizarre materials made by strange people. Ugh!"
3,FUNNY BUT THIS UNCONTRABLE,"A VERY FUNNY ITEM BUT THE REMOTE CONTROL IN SOME INSTANCES WORKS FINE...AND AT TIMES THE MACHINESEEMS TO ACT ON ITS OWN VOLITION, ""FARTING"" AT WILL WITHOUT THE USE OF THE REMOTE."
2,Strap breaks easily,This helmet looks good and is made of stronger plastic than the really cheap ones. It went perfect with my son's bob the builder costume. But... the strap inside the helmet broke the very first day we had it!!
1,(*****) a bad word,"I am sorry , this record is not a good one, compared to what Aleman did in Paris, this is plastic music, don't waste money on this one, buy his old stuff which is very good...."
2,"Looks Good, Anyway","It scoops OK if you hold it under hot water between scoops. In hard ice cream, the front end doesn't really help. I can't say this is a bad scoop; but it's no better than cheaper scoops I've had and today I noticed a problem I don't remember ever having (and I'm an old guy).I ordered this scoop on January 18th. I'm one person and didn't use it much for months, though I've eaten quite a bit of ice cream since hot days started. Today, I saw that the chrome is chipping (or wearing) off. I'm shopping for another, maybe stainless steel?"
2,yust part of the original banco,"New record withouth Franchesco de Giacommo (the singer), makes the recort not in offGianni Nozety (keyboards) voiceA lot of cliks from the old banco. Laking the originality, profution and complexity of the 70looks like a record to sell the name, no the musicSometimes interesting, but with no albun concept"
3,Beautiful reproductions with unwanted moral interpretations,"I did love the reproductions, both full and detailed, however I was quite disappointed with much of the text and the author's position that Vermeer's art is nothing more than a commentary on the lack of morality in the women he paints. The author claims that, in virtually every Vermeer painting, the subject represents a social problem - specifically women who are vain, lazy or adulterous. I wish the book had fewer interpretations of the art."
5,Vermeer,This book is amazing. The artwork is very clear and well documented. The facts in this book also agree with other sources. An engaging read and was an amazing help in writing a paper.
2,For the Very Patient Reader,"Like repetitive brush strokes, the author's sparse prose circles round and round, to build up a vivid portrait of the life of an artist in Renaissance Italy. Alternating chapters describe the lives of three artists, two unknown and one the revered painter, Titian. It took me a while to get into the book. The writing style is vivid, but repetitive and distancing. I'd recommend this book for those with a more serious interest in the creative life of 16th century Italy."
3,Nice Weighted Ball,I like the color and soft shell of this ball. I would still prefer a larger diameter for those times you need to hold the ball with two hands.
5,son-in-law very happy,We brought this item for our son-in-law for Christmas and he was like a two year old waiting for santa. He was one very happy guy come Christmas morning knowing he was getting the Milwaukee dril set.Two of his friends have it so he could hardly wait for his. It was the hit of Christmas and still is a hit.Wonderful item for the tool loving guy.
1,Poor pictures,"I'm not famillair with the website ,so unless you're a fan don't buy this book .Just common or ugly girls with tattoos and/or piercing pretending to be rebels ...To what and what for ?"
1,Decadent,"I call this book ""decadent"" and by that I mean an ignorant form of self-indulgence glamorized as something artful, and symbolizing the dumbing down and degradation of culture. Above all, sexist in the worst way.Let me qualify where I'm coming from. I'm not a feminist, not a holy man, and not a ""do gooder."" I'm a professional cleaner and I came across this book during a suicide cleanup. The victim's last moments were spent looking at this book. What else should I say? Could I say this book reaffirms life and female power? It did nothing for my female, Hispanic suicide victim.I want to let readers know that Hispanic female suicides are very rare, except in Santa Ana, California. So I'm inclined to say that this ""book"" does indeed raise suicidal ideation in those prone to suicide. Perhaps the correlation doesn't work, but the logic does, at least for me.Avoid this book and discard it whenever possible.Eddie Evans[...]"
5,Sexy 21th Century Pin-Ups.,"Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. Girls of all shapes and sizes, girls with body rings, girls with tattoos, girls with free minds. Goth and punk, leather and lace, these women are the successors of Bettie Page. From Japan, Italy, from every major city in Canada and the US, there are over 250 girls who call themselves SuicideGirls and this book only showcases a few of them. From cute to sexy, from a simple nude to complex pose, all this ladies are wonderful to look at and a treat for the inner soul. From Mary on the cover to Voltaire who is a living work of art you will enjoy every inch of their lovely skin.In short, hubba-hubba."
3,"Fun, but not as fun as the site.","I've been a member of SG for a long time and I'm really glad to be able to say that the book captures the essence of the models' portion of the site. The community aspect of SG is its main draw for me, but I can't help appreciating Missy's excellent photography, the beauty of the models, and the way they choose to represent themselves."
5,A Neat Lil Scrapbook,"Very very nice collection of photographs from the website. In my honest opinion however, the girls that were chosen are basically the most famous ones on the site. I would have opted to go with a few different ""models"", but nonetheless the photos that were chosen are among the most memorable (just as the journal entries). The book is merely a sampling of what it is to log onto the site.It is just too bad there is not more, the book ends very quickly (as it is hard to put down and save for later). For any fan of the site, it is a must have book; to the people who are weary of joining, it is a glimpse into another world where things are just different... simply because they can be.This is peering into the world of other people, just like us, with a stylistic aura of attitude and appeal. To make it as simplistic as possible, the reason this book is here is because of the community that it is made of.Great shock value for the conservative! Be sure to at least check it out."
5,SuicideGirls Book Excellent,"The Internet phenomenon of SuicideGirls.com is now available in the real world -- as a book. Glossy portraits of the girls adorn each page. Half the book are personal pages for the SG's -- journal entries, more pictures, facts and so on. The book is excellent!"
5,rockin' collection,"this book is an amazing collection of content from the site and gives you a little bit of the personality of the featured suicide girls. its an amazing ""read"" and definitely is a must-buy!"
1,Get real.,"This is not ""counter-culture"" at all. It's feeding into the same woman-hating BS that's been everywhere for the past eon or two. These are images of female oppression. Nothing new here; move along."
3,NOTE:Don't believe what other people say because...,"Well,the owner of the SuicideGirls.com told the SG members to review this book nicely then they could get some ""army points"" that can be exchanged for free SG goods or extended membership. So,do not believe in all the ""good"" reviews here. Be careful.Most of the photos in this book are simply taken from SuicideGirls.com and there are only few private pictures of some selected models. That's all. I think if you already have visited the site,you don't need to buy this...unless you're a hardcore SG fan.The photos are taken by self-taught photographers and the quality is not that good. However,the models are very attractive and unique with their own styles,bodymods...etc. If you are interested in girls with bodymods and haven't visited the site,it might be pretty interesting. But that's it."
3,Cute girls..But,"Im a female photographer who was given a copy of this book for my birthday. I really wanted to love it, but its really not all that exciting unless your REALLY into SG, or a fan of the SG model type. The photography is clean but the concepts are pretty atypical."
2,My bathroom book ...,"This isn't exactly the kind of book that you sit down and read. I am an SG member and was pretty disappointed when I picked this book up. I was expecting, maybe an interesting bio and good inside facts to the SG website and girls. The only really awesome thing about it is that you get a lot of good pictures of the girls in a nice lil book. The lady's entries aren't exactly interesting, poetic, or even very enlightening. They're basically blog entries from their website profile. This book gets quite a bit of attention at home, in the bathroom, from all of my guy friends. No one actually looks at it for more than 1 minute though."
5,Suicide Girls The Home version!!!,I just became apart of the Suicide Girl WOrld...Herd About itt went to the Burlesque show 2 weeks ago then signed up apart of the internetthis and Im hooked ... The Book shows these beautiful and mysteriose women in all thier glory. The pictures are mind bending and so is the sneak peak in to the world of these beauties ..If your intrested in these women or like great ART GET THIS BOOK
5,Amazing!,"Suicide Girls the book is amazing. The photography and the girls are stunning. What was really great to me was that you heard from the girls, what made them become suicide girls and how its changed there life. This book like the site is such a beautiful piece of art. Join the site and buy the book!...voodo"
3,Just o.k.,"This was a cute book. Not worth buying, though, as a few minutes is all you and your kid will spend reading it. It would be good for a classroom, though."
4,Good Vacation Feeders,Good Vacation Feeders for extended time away from home. Dousn't appear to cloud the water either. Couldn't find any trace of the food upon my return after 8-10 days away.
3,Mixed blessing,"I've just tried this product on a 3-gal. tank with 3 goldfish, leaving them for 10 days with one tablet.The good news: the fish are alive (I guess, that's what matters most). The not so good one: pretty much all surfaces of the aquarium, including the plants and the innards of the pump have been covered with rather sticky white goo which wouldn't wash off on its own without actively brushing it off. A bit of a nuisance, requiring a thorough clean-up. Next time, I am going to try an automatic feeder likeEHEIM Everyday Fish Feeder Programmable Automatic Food Dispenserbut it's still good to have a couple of these tablets in case of an emergency."
1,Ruined the Aquarium Environment,"These feeding blocks ruined my classroom aquarium's environment. We had a total of 10 days of spring break vacation. When I got back, the floor of the aquarium and all the plants were covered with a white debris, the water was clouded, and one fish who was visibly struggling to breath died a few days later. It took a huge amount of effort to restore the aquarium's healthy environment. I will never again use a feeding block for an extended period of time. My students and I were deeply saddened by the state of the aquarium upon our return. In the future, I will shell out the big bucks for an electric fish feeder."
5,Did the trick!,Went on vacation for 2 weeks. Got a few of these more my Freshwater tanks. Came back in 2 weeks and everyone was still alive. The tablet was dissolved with no residue or milky water. Next Time I go on vacation I will be ordering these again.
1,Clouds my water,"TERRIBLE!! don't buy this mess for your fish. I used it while away on vacation for just 1 weekend and came back to a mess and dead fish. What a waste of money and at the end of the day, there is nothing to return!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY!I used these when I went away on vacation for a week. They didn't work at all, and killed my fish. Out of about 20 fish, all of them but just 3 died. The blocks totally disintegrated within a few hours or days because I wasn't gone for 14 days and the blocks were nowhere to be seen in the water. I placed them in a few hours before leaving, but unfortunately I didn't get the chance to test them out. I don't know how long they really lasted for, but it was less than 7 days. The packaging and description says 14 days. Yeah, that is B-S. Unless if you want to intentionally kill your fish, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,it worked?,"I've heard fish can go about 2 weeks without food.It so happened I had a 2 week vacation. The couple of days before I left I fed the fish more often. Then plopped one of these in the tank.I came back and every fish was alive and the food block was dissolved completely. Did it work, or did they just survive from what they had already eaten? Who knows but they were alive."
5,Very eclectic jazz stylings,"Before getting this album, the only song of Hancock's that I was really familiar with was ""Rockit"", although I had heard ""Chameleon"" once or twice. So it was a nice suprize to hear his many styles of jazz on one album. Some people may not like his electric, synthesizer-driven jazz of the 70's, but for someone who is not sure, this album is a great place to decide, as it has a good variety of his styles. Including his more ""traditional"" earlier stuff as well. The booklet includes photos and an informative essay on Hancock."
5,Bruce Gilden's Look At Irish Horse Racing,"""After the Off"" is yet another brilliant documentary photograph book of Bruce Gilden's work. His artistic motifs of flash and disembodied figures leads to a riveting, mesmerizing look at the seemingly mundane world of Irish horse racing. Anyone thinking of a placid view of Irish racing will be stunned, and perhaps, shocked by his photographs. Dermot Healy's short story is a fine coupling, but it is completely overshadowed by Bruce Gilden's photography."
3,The Dirt Detective with Craig Ferguson,"If you want to see Craig Ferguson when he was very young but not as funny as he is now this is it. The DVD shows him traveling ancient ruins in his native Scotland and it's very interesting, but he seems really stiff and nervous."
2,"Solid, Not Special","This little book is an entirely competant introduction to the traditional Reformed unerstanding of grace, though it's rarely poignant and never insightful. There's nothing particularly wrong with it other than its dated prose, but anyone who's already reasonably knowledgeable in the subject will be far better off studying Jonathan Edwards instead."
3,Panasonic 72mm Polaroid Filter,"It fits. I'm using this in conjunction with my DMZ L1K. Although I've yet to use this to take pictures through the glare of water - e.g., fishing pix - I have used it for 100s of outdoor shots and find no discernible difference.For example, I was having trouble taking detailing pix of buttercups and presumed that the glare of the sun was washing out all of the details, but the filter made no difference there nor with Apple blossoms.It seems enormously expensive. Be careful it's screwed in properly I already dropped it once and almost had a heart attack before it hit the hard wood floor - but it didn't break"
3,Bally 3lb ball,"I cancled this order a couple of hours after I placed it. They said they needed more info to cancle which i gave but the order was sent anyway. They told me I could send it back, of course at my expense. I really feel like I was ripped off, and it makes me hesitant to order anything else!!!"
1,don't be fooled,"I made the mistake of buying this CD without listening to the samples. This is essentially a vocal CD. I am in awe of Franks trombone playing, but not his vocals"
1,DIsappointing to say the least,"Robert Parker's classic recordings for the Nola label deserve much better than this. Everything here is mastered from vinyl, and in many cases, it's very bad vinyl. Hiss, major scratches and distortion abound in most of these transfers. This is a truly dreadful CD."
