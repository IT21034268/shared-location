1,MORE CRAPPY STUFF FROM SONY,"I CAN'T BEIEVE IT - SAME CRAP I FOUND MY ""LAST"" CHRIS BOTTI - IT DOES NOT PLAY. IT MAY BE OK IN MY CD PLAYER IN MY TRUCKNO RESPONSE FROM WEB HELP; I HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER AND DIRECTX SINCE I ONLY HAVE WINDOWS 2000 - MY WORK COMPUTER WHICH I CANNOT UPGRADE, NOT MY PERSONAL COMPUTERLAST DISC I BUY FROM SONY - END OF SUBJECTMAD AS HELL"
3,"Great Band and Great Music, but Copy Protected CD","Montgomery Gentry is one of my favorite country bands. Their latest CD, ""Something To Be Proud Of: The Best of 1999-2005"" is a great CD. It's only missing one of their more popular songs, ""Cold One Coming On"". The content of this CD is 5 stars.One downfall to this release is that it contains copy protected content. You will NOT be able to play OR rip this CD without using Windows Media Player. None of my other programs such as MusicMatch or Winamp recognize there is a CD in the drive. You have to install software to play the CD on your computer! This is why I gave this CD only 3 stars."
1,Beware - copy protected CD,"Sadly, this trend has spread to country music. This CD tries to install software on your computer. It will only let you make 'limited copies' that can only be transferred to 'approved devices' and it will only play on your PC using certain programs. All in all, this is very unsatisfactory. The mess Sony got themselves in with their copy protection software should have been a warning to all companies, but apparently it wasn't.Amazon sometimes warns you before purchasing a CD with copy protection; in which case I always pass. However, this time they didn't include a warning.Are Montgomery Gentry great? You bet. And I'm sure they didn't have anything to do with the decision to install this spyware on their fan's computers."
5,something to be proud of,Montgomery Gentry really chose a great title for this cd. This is their best songs. I have only been a big fan of theirs for a short time so I do not have all their cd's yet. This gives me all my favorites. I also like the 2 new ones. I especially like She don't tell me to. It reminds me of my husband and I because he does so much for me and I don't ask him to do alot of it. I know they dedicate it to their wives and their wives should be proud of them as I am.
4,City boy-acceptable,"I'm not a country person at all. I listen to hard rock most of the time but MG's songs really grab me. If you're looking for a change of pace, this is good stuff. Not too cheesy or cliched. Just good, sincere tunes with enough edge to keep a rocker interested. Give it a try."
4,well-written period piece,"Myrtle Reed is one of my favorite writers. The Spinner in the Sun is very typical of her work. It is a very moving novel of a woman who returns to her home after being away for many years. It is sweet, moving and romantic. (I'm embarrassed to admit I shed maybe two or three tears at the end). Miss Reed is very typical for her period so if you want to pretend you are reading popular fiction in a time other than now -- go ahead, give it a shot. No offense intended, but its a ""chick"" book. For some fun try ""At the Sign of the Jack 'o Lantern"". It was cute, and funny."
4,I also adore Myrtle Reed,"This book is a lovely introduction to the Edwardian world. Strong characters, a little bit of comedy and some tears. Mrs. Reed was known for her tearjerker novels, and she did her job well."
5,Old Fashioned Melodrama,"Many years ago an elderly woman I knew lent this book to me. She had found it in her attic on her farm. I loved the book as it was so old fashioned and melodramatic you felt pulled into another time where this type of story would have been common. I had been looking through antique stores and junk shops for years hoping that I might find a copy of it then, to my surprise, I found it on Amazon.com. If you like a good old fashioned escape, this is the book for you gentle reader."
4,"Wonderful characters and story, but watch the theology!","A very enjoyable read, with wonderful characters and a few plot twists. One caution to the Christian reader: at least one character overreacts against other characters' obsession with zealous ""hell-fire"" preaching by completely trading the biblical doctrines of hell (for example, Luke 16:23) for a concept of merely spending a Godless eternity."
3,"A pleasant, diverting Western","The Hard Man is not one of the alltime great Westerns, but it provides solid entertainment. Guy Madison (who played Wild Bill Hickok in a television series) was very much at home in this genre, and it shows as he plays a hard-bitten sheriff with a trigger-happy reputation. His last shooting involved a man who was framed for his crimes, which leads Madison to a town run by Lorne Greene, who was definitely capable of playing roles other than kindly, paternal Ben Cartwright from Bonanza.In this film, Greene is scheming, evil, and does whatever is needed to get his way. His beautiful young wife, played by the great Valerie French, has flirtations with Madison, in addition to having a full-fledged affair with Greene's business partner, played by Barry Atwater. Of course, things get worse before they get better, but it's all fun to watch, and none too taxing. The Hard Man is quite good for passing the time without being painful to watch."
5,GREAT SET!,"Got this set for my second son's room. We wanted something boyish, but also not too flashy. Also bought the wall border, wall hangings and mobile. The baby definately enjoys the pictures."
1,Horrible investment,The crib ruffle shrunk considerably after following manufacturers washing instructions.The Bumber ties are too short to be able to tie onto crib.The valance is only available when purchasing this set and it too small for our window.The quilt looks horrible after washing!
5,We love it,We love this crib set for our newest addition. The colors are wonderful and it goes great for either a boy or a girl.
5,Very cute & durable,"My husband and I absolutely love this pattern. The material, fabric and wear are all excellent. If you are going for a sea theme I highly recommend this design."
2,Not that great,"The bumper was very difficult to attach to the crib. The tie on didn't match the crib slats. Be sure to measure your windows because the valance was too short for mine. The bedskirt and quilt were very cute, but the sheet was cheap and not very soft."
3,Walken shines,"Is a ""predictable mess"" an oxymoron? If not, that is a perfect description of this script. There was not one surprise in the plot past the first scene. But the performances of Robert Forster and Christopher Walken diverted my attention enough so that it was a pleasant experience. Forster did a wonderful job considering the completely unbelievable character he was saddled with, although his accent needed improvement. Of all the gangsters I've seen Walken portray, this one was the most delightful. His boyish charm as a cold-blooded gangster made for hilarity every time he was given the spotlight. If the entire movie had been watching Chris, it would earn five stars. But whenever the focus is shifted to another character the film sank. Michael Rappaport and Christine Taylor were adequate, but only a thespian as gifted as Walken can get through so preposterous a script with dignity intact."
3,7 Color Changing Nite Lite,"Purchased two of these, under the impression they had the auto on-off feature, which these did not. Ace Hardware is a great place to purchase, it is not their fault. Would definitely buy from them again, but would make sure all the features I was looking for were included. Description was misleading though. Light does what is mentioned, but it doesn't light up 7 colours. I only see blue, (very light) green, and some weird mixture of blue and white/blackish colour. No red that I have seen, and it goes through these colours very quickly, and kinda skips clumsily...not a very smooth transition."
2,IT'S JUST A NIGHT LIGHT ..... BUT I LOVE IT!,"Much much cooler looking than you can tell from the picture. It is really an awesome changing nightlight (if you like them and are in the market to purchase)5 stars, no complaints, and highly recommend!**** UPDATE FEB 2010 ****NO LONGER IN LOVE WITH THIS ONE. IT STARTED TO MAKE NOISE WHILE CHANGING COLOR AND NOW IS JERKY AND NO LONGER SMOOTH AND EVEN LIGHT COLOR CHANGING.NO SOOTHING ... NOT IT'S ANNOYING. :(BUMMER!"
3,Pretty light with pros and cons,"Update 10/15/2012:Pros: The different-sized clear plastic strips look pretty when lit and make a nice reflection on the wall behind it. The blue and red colors light up best. The nightlight has been on constantly for over 20 months, and still works.Cons: The purple color is very fleeting and the green is quite faint. Also, there is a slight flicker during one of the color changes. This was more of an annoyance initially though rarely noticed now, given where the light is placed.Note: The Leviton #L20 is mainly decorative, not throwing enough light to be functional. But if you want a splash of color, it does the job.Conclusion: Pretty decoration, could use some improvement."
4,cosmetically nice,"If you want a night light then you must establish WHY you need it. If it's something pretty that glows in the dark this is a great light. We got 2. I actually wanted them so that we could put one in the nursery and one in the bathroom so we could check the baby and use the bathroom without turning lights on. Well, these are ok provided that you are on the blue or white colour stage of the phasing. When they go to the reds and the purples they throw no light at all. They glow but you cannot see enough to walk safely in the dark. This is not their function. They are pretty things for kids to gaze at while drifting off to sleep, NOT to enable you to move about without turning lights on. We still use them for that pretty colouring but we still invested in 2 ordinary white light night lights and those are functional, NOT cosmetic."
5,"No need for cords, unless you want them....","I have the entire 24V kit, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I like the AC/DC converter feature, so that when the uncommon dead battery situation happens, you're not left without power. DeWalt: How about a 24V jig saw, plate jointer, miter saw and handheld planer? I'll buy them whenever they come out."
2,"Nice illustrations, but does not explain mom's growing belly","Nice illustrations, but there is no story, just some strange questions and statements about mom needing to sleep more and shopping for new baby cloths. Not the book I was hoping for to prepare our 15 month old for his sister."
5,Nice Book That Looks Like a Multiracial Family,"This book is adorable. It is appropriate for explaining a baby is coming to a toddler. My son was easy to follow along with the pictures as it appears the book is multiracial, like our family (mother is light, son and father are darker skinned). Very nice, indeed"
5,great get ready for bay book,"This is a picture book, no words, which is great for a family to create their own story. I would recommemd this book to anyone having a second child to prepare the first born for all that is ahead for mommy. I also purchased the sequel book ""My new Baby"" again wonderful my son always wants these books read to him. Hope any or all of this helped."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this book to read to my 2 1/2 year old daughter as part of preparing her for an addition to the family. My daughter loves books and I enjoy reading them to her. The reading level is listed as Baby-Preschool and I was curious to see how the author would write about such a sensitve subject so that children of a young age would understand. To my surprise, I quickly realized that the ""author"" chose not to deal with the subject at all and the book consists only of pictures. While its easy enough for a parent to make up a story using the illustrations, there are so many other books out there that have illustrations AND pictures that I would suggest spending your money elsewhere. I also bought Our New Baby by Beth Atchison which I was very happy with. However, if you're considering buying that book please be advised that there are references to God, so if you're not a Christian it might not be for you."
3,It's Ok,"I was disappointed about the text. It's mainly pictures and there isn't really a story to follow. That being said, my daughter seems to like it. It includes a lot of the topics that need to be addressed with a new baby coming. They're just presented in kind of a scattered form."
4,Make up a new story each time,My 2 1/2 yr old really loves this book and is excited about becoming a big sister. This book requires a bit more imagaination on the parents' part because there are no words but it's fun to make up a new story each time.
5,Very helpful,Helps little ones understand the concept of the new arriving baby. I love there are no words and that we can make our own stories. My daughter (2) likes to read/look at it on her own. A really good book for little big sisters or brothers to be.
1,No Words,"I wish I had read the reviews. There are no words, you have to create your own story, just FYI for other people who are browsing."
1,nope,"Why is everyone saying there aren't words? There are and they're stupid. This book is awful and isn't about waiting for a baby, no explanations or anything."
3,Book: WAITING FOR BABY,A reasonable book on the topic. Still looking for a better one for toddler siblings.
2,Baby book,"I bought this book for my 6 year old who will be a big sister soon. I was hoping it would be a book she would enjoy and challenge her current reading skills. It is literally a baby book, not many words. If you are buying this for a toddler who doesnt have a long attention span it would fit your needs"
2,Waiting for baby,"I was disappointed in this purchase because i thought the book had words. It doesn't, which I thought was strange."
2,Not my favorite,"My son, 2 1/2, seemed to enjoy this book but I thought it was a bit babyish for him though the manufacture states for preschoolers."
3,"Adorable, but...","We purchased this whole series to prepare my 2.5 y/o for his little brother. Though the concept is great and the illustrations wonderful, the ""conversation starter"" text is a bit lacking. I bought these with the specific purpose of the jump off points to open the q&a;, but a lot of the sentences don't make a ton of sense, at least not to me or my husband (or my parents), to start a conversation between my son and I. The page pictured, is one of the only places they make sense. And this goes for all the books in the series. He loves these books, though, and that's what matters. I do recommend them, but just be prepared to carry most of the concept yourself.Note: I have placed this same review on each book in the series."
5,Great for open-ended discussion on new baby!,"The fact that there are no words in the book means that one can personalize the story for the older child--and that is awesome. My son loves reading this book, because it is about ""him."" Interaction with mommy and daddy is emphasized, as is the child's role in helping prepare for the new arrival. There is no gender assigned to the new baby, and the hospital room is generic enough that one could substitute ""birthing center,"" or another alternative. Fantastic and simple."
2,A Picture Book,"I bought this and ""My New Baby"" for my son when I was expecting his first sibling. I was unhappily surprised to find they did not have words, just pictures. That definitely should be part of the product description.It isn't too hard to make up a story, but if I would have known it was lacking words I never would have bought it."
4,Good...,"This was a good book and it tied in the books ""the Puppet King"" and ""The Lioness"", also ""The War of Souls Trilogy."" I love the cliffhanger and it sucked me at the beginning. I couldn't seem to put this book done. But I have read other books and unfortunely they were Forgotten Realms books and one of them happened to be of the Drow storyline or the riveting Hunter's Blades Trilogy or the Last Mythal trilogy. Otherwise, it was good and I am wondering when volume two will come out. I was sucked and it worked. So, I would recommend this book but I have read better novels about elves."
5,CHEF'N TOOLS,GREAT SHAPES AND COLORS. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ONE PIECE. IT ASSURES ME THAT NO FOODS ARE SEEPING IN BETWEEN THE HANDLE AND SCRAPER PIECE. THEY ALSO SAVE ME TIME REGARDING THE FACT THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THEM APART TO CLEAN THEM AFTER USE. I AM SURE I WILL BE PURCHASING OTHER CHEF'N ITEMS.
3,Broken but unharmed,The case was pretty smashed when I got it - to the point that I really cannot use it. But amazingly enough the CD's were fine.
2,Not for sensitive skin,"I have really sensitive skin, I admit, but this shampoo and conditioner made my scalp really dry and itchy. I switched over to Aveda sensitive scalp, much better."
1,Spinning Basics,"This dvd offers strictly the basics. It is not a workout dvd in the sense that one would think from the way it looks. It demonstrates the basic movements, i.e., going from sitting to standing, how many revolutions per minute for results, etc. It is not a full work out. Simply basics."
2,I hate the music,"What I dislike about this and several of the other Spinning DVDs is the music. It's distracting and causes me to have a reduced pace of work and less energy. I find good music to be very energizing, but enduring this music during the routine makes for a much less enjoyable experience. When I take Spinning classes at the gym the instructors often use House Music and uptempo Rap or Pop mixes and other contemporary music that creates a feeling that time is flying by because you're having so much fun. When I hear that really good beat and especially if it is accompanied by motivating lyrics, I feel as though I just got a charge of energy and I'm in the groove - performing at my highest level and enjoying every second of it. As opposed to the music on these DVD's which makes it seem like time is dragging on."
1,cheese and a waste of money,"From a hetero-guy's perspective, this dvd is lame for a number of reasons:1) only one workout2) the instructors an odd-ball3) the bikes in the video use a technology that is not readily available (i.e., spin-bike computers that display how fast your peddling etc)4) I prefer to look at women when I'm working out"
3,Really good,I liked it it was really funny. I dont really now what alse to say about it exept that it is a good movie.
1,not reliable,This was great for about a week. Then it lost the ability to recharge. Now we have to plug in the camcorder wherever we go. Buy this and some really long extension cords and you can take video anywhere!
4,I LOVE JOE 90!;) :),"I think Joe 90 is great and I wish more people would know about them! Joe 90 does display a mellow type of music but I love all kinds of music! I think Seafried, the lead singer has wonderful lyrics that search for truth and give advice along the way. When I listen to this C.D. I feel touched by it because they seem unique to some degree, they also show curiousity, and Joe 90 gives lyrics that show a wanting to know more about life and to be cautious where you go in life. I recommend this to any one who wants to try a rare artist and likes to just chill out to music that has a calm style.My favorite songs are(in no order):1. Gone2. Stop3. Cars Go Bye4. When You Arrive5. Angels Got AwayAlso, the couple of songs that were also on, ""Dream This"" have a slight different sound that I was amazed that I liked too. Because sometimes, I don't like hearing two versions of the same song."
4,Eyewitness books always a good buy,"I bought this for my mother who was suffering from Alzheimers and had been an art major in university. It is hard to find inexpensive yet well produced general art books, and I wanted it more for the pictures than the text since she could no longer read. This worked pretty well, but larger pictures would have been nice in this particular case. Great for kids though !"
1,Save your money,"I had this on video,save your money this is awful! Unless you're one of those that buys everything Beatles (guilty as charged) I'd skip it. The performances are weak by all involved. Yoko's doing her scream/yodel over anything that's even slightly good. For collectors only!That said, if you can find John Lennon live in New York City, while far from perfect (but when its good it's really good)I would highly recommend that one"
2,"Good performance, BAD sound mix","If you've heard the L.P. or (Remixed) CD of the album ""Live Peace in Toronto 1969"", then you know what to expect musically: 6 songs featuring John Lennon(hastily learned & rehearsed on an airplane flight from London) and an unusual 2nd half featuring Yoko Ono's avant-garde wailing backed by the group's jamming & guitar feedback.Unfortunately, due to record company permission issues, this video program cannot use the mix heard on the 1969 L.P., or the even better remix which replaced it in the CD era. Instead, the filmmakers use the live soundmix that the audience heard. Alan White's drums are down too low, and Eric Clapton's fine lead guitar wanders in and out of audibility.This disc is disappointing. Hopefully, someday, we'll get a DVD of this show with audio that does justice to the performances."
3,guess he wasn't in the mood to play 8 days a week,"I wasn't gonna write a review. But everyone seems to come here with a knowledge already of what happened at this concert and even the role it played in rock's history. So let me say what I thought everyone's reaction would be.... utterly appalling. Even though I despised Yoko's wailing, I thought that at some level it worked in accentuating the suicidal feeling of Yer Blues and heroin withdrawal symptoms of Cold Turkey. After that, Yoko stole the show, which amounted to one of the most caustic things I have viewed anywhere. I'm sure that's all been said. What surprised me was how unabashedly she performed in front of a huge crowd and on the same stage as some of rocks greatest. The woman's got balls of steel. Meanwhile John had the look of a man who had lost all touch with reality. Either from the crushing weight of fame or the blind love he had for his wife this all seemed pretty normal to him. Anyway it was an interesting show"
4,ROCKING IN TORONTO,"IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE ONLY LIVE-IN-CONCERT DVD FROM LENNON'S SOLO CAREER. BUT THE 20 MINUTES OR SO THAT WE HAVE OF THIS PERFORMANCE AMOUNTS TO SOME OF THE HARDEST HITTING PERFORMANCES IN ROCK'S LONG HISTORY. I ONLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE YOKO SIDE, JUST CANNOT LISTEN TO HER SCREECHING VOCALS.THE LENNON ESTATE NEEDS TO FOLLOW THIS WITH THE FIRST DVD APPEARANCE OF ""LIVE IN NYC""."
2,"""Everybody Loves Dar""","Should have called this one ""Everybody Loves Dar"". What was an occasional tendency in the first book, and a trend in the second and third efforts, has come to full and damaging fruition in the fourth Dar & Kerry story in the series. The chorus of admiration for Dar Roberts has grown to deafening proportions in Red Sky. As well it should, since every character but Dar sings that particular one note song endlessly. Ms. Good seems to have lost the measure of her two main characters and most sadly of all, the tenor of their relationship, to this apparently irresistable need to puff every aspect of Dar."
1,Can't stand on laurals,"Obviously attempting to stand on previous publications, Miss Good has a flop with this drivel. Her characters of Dar and Kerry compliment each other, but Dar is just overplayed in this slow moving, computer language drivel. You can't stand on previous laurals Missy so concentrate on better writing if you want me to buy anymore of your books."
2,How I've changed!,"When I read this book eight years ago I would have rated it at 4 - fascinating and stimulating. Now, however, on second reading, I struggle to give it a 2. Basically I just don't like the characters. The only male, John, is wishy washy - has faced a failing marriage for years and yet has done nothing about it - and the only action here is to find a confidant and turn them into an affair. His wife is appalling, unrealistically negative - does she have no redeeming features? Then there is Geneva - another struggling female despite her smart-alec, erudite appearance, with two awful daughters - arethey supposed to be clever too. And the one redeeming female spoils her copybook by being bowled over in her friendship by sex - as if that is all that can turn a female from a friend to someone with love in them! But as she slipped in my respect - well, I'll leave that to the reader to discover ......"
1,What????,"Well, perhaps those who reviewed this film favorably need to be brought back to earth.Mind you, I love bad movies. Ed Wood and Phil Tucker are among my favorites. And I have a few others in my libary which I applaud as they have $2.68 special effects budgets that make them worth watching. (And some are made by those who later became big!)But, as far as budget, yeah, this one's low. As far as humor, the funniest thing about the story was the fact that at the fire dept. dance or whatever it was, all the dishes on the buffet table were a variation on the theme of lime jello. The rest of the humor consisted of silly, over-used cliches.If you want to see this one once, okay. I doubt you'll want to see it again.All right. It's more enjoyable than ""Battlefield Earth."" That in itself says....something."
2,"""B"" Movie Extraordinaire","This movie is sooooo bad, it is bound to be a classic! Bad script, bad acting, bad special effects...I'm sure even the catering was bad. So bad, we loved it! An inspiration to amateur cinematographers everywhere, this movie makes you want to grab your camcorder and start filming your own horror flick. What would we compare it to? ""Bats"" or ""Anaconda"" - on a budget. The biggest difference is, never once is the viewer supposed to take the movie seriously. But, what do we know? We spent many a Saturday afternoon watching ""The World Beyond"". If you like campy spoofs, this is the movie for you."
4,Good fundamental text on HCI,"I have used this book in my course in Usability and User Centered Design, and have found that the presentation and segmentation of issues in the book provides a good framework to teach the concepts of HCI especially to Computer Science majors."
1,Contains very little practical advice,"This book contains lots of threads that are never tied together. For example, there is some very simple school-level psychology in the opening few chapters which is not related well to user interface design. The book does not contain much practical advice on designing user interfaces.See Alan Cooper's book ""About Face"" for a far more entertaining and thought-provoking read."
1,"What is in this ""Best of Sesame Street"" DVD set?","Common, Amazon... there isn't even enough information here to make a purchase! What DVDs are included in this ""Best of Sesame Street"" set? And no picture, either? :("
1,Not what it seemed,"I ordered this because I had seen (but, alas, not bought at the time) ""The Best of Sesame Street"" in a store and the 3 items included were great old ones. On Amazon, there was no picture of the set's box, and the description did not list the DVDs included. It turned out to be three nondescript, uninteresting DVDs in a box that was not like the box I saw in the store. I returned it, but they charged me shipping and handling, and I was out the time and effort. The return process gave no way to explain the problem.Be aware that you're ordering a pig in a poke."
2,Rainbow Corners,"First off, this HDTV has the best sound and ""could"" have the best picture of any HDTV you can buy. Then, what's the problem? The problem is color shift, in all four corners, about the size of a grapefruit. It's a major flaw, that exists in about half the sets. How do Sony repair shops want to correct the problem? With magnets. Take a raincheck."
1,I have no faith in Sony any more,"Before I was born, my parents owned a Sony and we kept that old set until I was in high school. It lasted, just like everyone else's Sony did. Everywhere you go people say that Sony makes the longest lasting TV sets. I used to be one of those people. I bought a KD36XS955 7.5 months ago and it is now sitting in a repair shop. I have no clue what is wrong and neither does the repair shop. Furthermore, Sony's manufacturer's warranty covers parts only for two years. Yes, that's right, I get to pay for someone else's labor to fix a defective set sold to me.I have never liked Sony's other products as I find them of low-quality, but I always loved their TV sets. Now, I have nothing positive to say about the company.Panasonic, here I come!"
1,Not good,"This cart is completely unstable, and clumsy. It's not easy to transport and it's large it's a big cart to store as well."
4,Attractive,These unique looking dessert goblets are perfect for when you are entertaining or just enjoying ice cream or pudding by yourself. I like them so much I'm going to order another set for myself and one more for a gift!
4,"Nicely designed, sturdy dessert dishes","I like these a lot and they go through the dishwasher just fine. They're on the elegant side although made of thicker glass than some might want; but for all-purpose use they're great. I also use them for dip and yogurt, etc."
3,nice southern beats treats for blowin ears,"it could be better if the artist he uses would get into their on style and be more creative. i love it and i love the way he represent my city of P.A.T. that's Port Arthur, Texas for those who don't know"
2,very dissapointing,"This is the second Slick Shoes album i bought. The first being Rusty, where Rusty is really fast, melodic and..well..punk, this release is the exact opposite of that. The music is surprisingly slow, but what's worse is that the melodies dont make sense. Some songs start out really good, but then they go absolutely nowhere, this really is a shame. After this i did buy Burn Out, which is a brilliant follow up to Rusty. That really is a great Punk album, just like Rusty, but with Wake Up Screaming they really missed the mark. I really hope they get their act together and make another great punk album like they used to make. Oh and that new guitarist Greg Otowa (or something) he's nowhere near as good as Jackson (i think, im not good with names)"
4,WAKE UP SCREAMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a pretty average cd. Alot of the songs sound the same but there are some great tracks. All and all it's alright and I'll definately buy their new one. Buy this if you like MxPx, The Undecided, or Nofx. If you hate the cd you have to love the cover."
4,One of the best live shows you'll ever see!!!,"I had the pleasure of seeing these guys perform in Austin, TX, along with bands Jersey and Cooter. It was the first time for me to see Slick Shoes, but I was very familiar with them from previous albums and appearances on ""Songs From the Penalty Box 2"". I was blown away within the first ten minutes. And their album is just as good. Finally, an awesome punk band that delivers the goods. They're young, they're fast, and defintely worth what you pay for. So grab ""Wake Up Screaming"", or any of their previous albums, and be prepared to have your hair blown back."
2,Huge disappointment,"I bought this cd on a hunch, something I don't usually like to do but I had heard so many good things about Slick Shoes. Well, I listened to it all the way through, and hated it. I continue to listen to it about every 2 weeks hoping that one of these times, it will grow on me, but the exact opposite is happening. This band seems to have talent, including decent vocals and guitar fills. Unfortunately, it sounds like someone took a great pop punk album and ripped out every single catchy hook from every song. Song after song sounds like one big long bridge between a catchy chorus, but the refrain never comes because it doesn't exist. Lucky for me, when I bought this album I also bought Homecoming by Craig's Brother (AWESOME ALBUM! ), saving my transaction from going down as the most disappointing purchase ever."
5,Slick Shoes = Rock and Roll,"Slick Shoes made an awesome album in Wake Up Screaming. Although the lineup changed a little (Greg replacing Jackson and Dale), the patented punk sound is still there, evident in flying power chords and single-string solos. Ryan Kepke (lead vocals) strays a little from the punk vocals of the past, making them more melodic than the monotone of Rusty and the Slick Shoes EP. Joe Nixon continues to excel at drumming, although the drums aren't produced as loud as on Burn Out. A finely tuned ear can hear the awesome fills. After listening to this album a lot, it makes MXPX look like their new album is sissy-punk."
2,"It really isn't good, dispite the 4-star Amazon rating","I have every Slick Shoes album except for the self titled EP. Thank god I started with Rusty and Burn Out and not this or I wouldn't have bought another SS album. All songs suffer from the same thing: they aren't consistent. A song may start out fine but then descends into what seems to be random drumming, monotenous singing and drab lyrics (never a strong point of SS)I did listen to it for quite a while and on different occasions, 'cuz maybe I just wasn't ready for this ""new"" direction SS was going, but to this day I still very much dislike the album. The follow up Self-titled album was a step in the right direction, but still not that great. Thankfully they've redeemed themselves with Far from Nowhere, which sounds more like Rusty and Burn Out.Only recommended to hardcore SS fans and if this is your first SS album, no NOT start with Wake Up Screaming"
4,Petty Treason,"I enjoyed the stories about Sarah Tolerance. I only wish there were more. She's an interesting character with unusual talents that keep the reader completely engaged in the story. How she ended up with an aunt who is a madam is not fully explained but a clever part of the story. Her love interests hint at a nice relationship to come with a Bow Street Magistrate but the stories ended after book two, so this was disappointing."
5,Inspirational,"I took a class at church in a small group where this book was the textbook. I went in with little to no expectation. I started reading.. and found that I couldn't put the book down. I got out my bible to read the noted scriptures. I took notes, highlighted, underlined, etc.I have since COMPLETELY changed the way I deal with any type of stress in my life. No matter how big or small, I am able to stop and think - how can I respond in a way that will glorify God? It is the MOST HELPFUL book I've EVER read.I just ordered ALL of Wayne Mack's other books on Amazon. I can't wait to receive them and continue on my journey of spiritual growth. <3"
5,Just like the movie,Our 6-year old loves the movie and we wanted to find the story in book form for her and this was it!
2,Cuisinart CSK-150 Electric Skillet,Received skillet from DependableResource. The skillet I received had many scratches and looked as if it had been used. The lid also did not fit properly. Dependable Resource issued an RA and said they had shipped a new skillet. When I called to find the tracking number for the new skillet they indicated it was out of stock and had not been shippped. I then cancelled my order and received a refund on my credit card.
3,rethinking the electric skillet,"I bought this skillet anticipating it would be handy while my kitchen is being renovated and I'd be without cook top facilities. The skillet is beautiful and has nice features but I decided it was not really necessary at this time. The size of it, quite large, could only be justified for me if it was getting consistent use as storing it would be a challenge in a house I'm trying to downsize. I'm returning it but for no other reason than I didn't think I'd make use of it enough to warrant the purchase."
1,Not what I wanted,I wanted a skillet with NO nonstick finish inside. It always wares off this one looked (in the picture) like it was not coated. I sent it back because it had a black coating in it when I got it. I am still looking for a skillet without nonstick coating inside.
1,Useless!,"Regulates it's own heat, regardless of heat setting. Heat is not even distributed as advertised. Useless to an accomplished cook!"
1,Cuisinart Electric Skillet Model # CUI CSK-150,"The skillet is a beautiful piece. It's the kind of cookware that you could put on the table and serve from. However, there is something wrong with this skillets thermostat. It will not keep the temperature you select. It starts off with the correct temperature but as you keep frying, the skillet gets cooler and cooler and by the time the thermostat kicks in, the skillet is so cold that the food stops cooking. No matter what temperature you set it at, it cannot keep the temperature you choose. I have had this skillet replaced twice from Cuisinart and all three of the skillets did the same thing. Cuisinart refuses to replace it with another model and will not give me my money back. I bought this product from Amazon.com. The customer service number is 1-800-726-0190."
2,Temperature Range is Horrible,"This skillet has even surface heating, easy to clean, etc. But it has the worst uneven temperature range I have ever used. It must vary over 100 degrees before it kicks the element on and off. I litterly have to operate the thermostat manually to keep the food cooking. Great skillet, terrible thermostat. I would return this item if it wasn't such a hassle. Therefore it goes into my pile of bad new skillets."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this item, as I own several Cuisinart products. This skillet is very noisy when heating. I contacted Cuisinart, customer service asked to hear over the phone. They easily heard how much noise it makes. They sent a new controller. Same. They had me return the skillet ($15 - my cost) and sent a new one ($10 - my cost). Received the new skillet today. Yep, it is as noisy as the last one. Does it work? Yes. Is it annoying? Yes. And I had to pay an additional $25 to find out it is just the way it is designed. Very disappointed."
1,Great when new BUT...,"I bought this skillet a year ago to replace a 20+ year old Farberware. I thought the nonstick feature would be nice. Worked well for the first 9 months or so, but then the temperature control started going until I could no longer cook anything unless I set it below 250 degrees. The last few times I have used it (no matter what I cook) the nonstick surface smokes so badly I have to air out the house. I tried it one more time this morning (for scrambled eggs) and the smoke was noxious. After reading about the dangers of nonstick cookware and the perfluorochemicals used to make it, I threw the eggs and the skillet in the garbage and logged on to Amazon to buy a new Farberware skillet."
3,"Great Product, But . . .","I have had a love/hate relationship with this product. My first one worked wonderfully for about six months until the heating unit failed. While it was working, it was wonderful. Because I have a substandard stovetop, I use this product almost every day. I purchased another one. I used it almost daily for a year, and it again was terrific. Heats up quickly, and evenly, and has a nice, large surface area. Then, the nonstick failed. Now, everything sticks. I am debating whether to even consider this product again."
1,A model T for a Cadillac price .,"I bought this product mostly on the Cuisinart name but was very disappointed to find the controller has wide temperatures variations between the on and off state, also in a pan of this price range I expected some kind of heat dispersal such as a copper or aluminum plate between the heating element and the cooking surface, but the area directly above the element scorched and ruined the non-stick coating in that area. In short it's 1950s technology with a fair non-stick coating.Cuisinart CSK-150 1500-Watt Nonstick Oval Electric Skillet"
4,"Works well, looks good, won't last forever","I can't believe I lived without an electric skillet for so long. This skillet heats up quickly, holds the temperature and I can leave it simmering away. I've made chili, bacon, pancakes and chicken... no cold spots or burn spots, the heat is even. It cleans up easily. My one complaint is that after only a couple of months I am seeing some wear on the nonstick finish (yes, I only used rubber tipped utensils, etc). I hate to think I will be throwing this away in a couple years, but that seems to be how everything is made these days.I used this over the holidays to bring dishes for pot lucks. It is pretty enough to serve from at a party, and again, it holds heat very well without scorching."
5,cuisinart oval electric skillet,This skillet is large enough for a big family. It maintains the temperature very well. It is easy to clean.
1,With Lady said not a Good Product,"I too use my Electric Fry Pan almost every night. I bought this one and it looks nice, easy to clean BUT as the other reviewer said after about 6 months the heating element goes haywire. No matter what you do it cooks at the highest temperature and it smokes. If you only use it once in a while fine. I sent it back, they sent me a new one and in 5 months same problem. It states dishwasher safe, I do not even use the dishwasher clean by hand to avoid water on the plug in and still same problem. While it looks nice it is only good for occasional use and only will last about 5-6 months, then even setting it on warm cooks full blast. Everything burns. I am still looking for a great skillet, but looks like no one makes a good one."
1,Refurbished is not 'new',"Saw the many good reviews and a few warning to watch out for refurbished units even though the purchase page clearly states that this item is new. Thought the quality reflected in the reviews made it worth the chance. Lost that bet. Found stains in indentations on the bottom of the body, marks on the non-stick coating that could not come from shipping, and the obvious blacked-out serial number with a new serial number printed below it. If it's not new, then I have no way to gauge how much life could be left in the non-stick coating. Pleased with Amazon's return process. Not pleased that I'm adding to the 'buyer beware' count for this item. Not trying again on this. I'll find something locally, even if I can't find this specific model."
4,Awesome for flat stuff,Rhe non-stick surface is amazing. I love the pan. The only complaint I have with it is that it doesn't allow for a full chicken to sit in the pan. You have to break the ribs and flatten it in order to get the lid to go down. Which is a big deal to us because we love roasting chicken in the pan. So it's only a minor complaint I guess.If they made it deeper with the same lid or they made the lid round up more in the middle it would be perfect.
1,displeased,"Bought this unit to use while our kitchen is being remodeled. Unit performed OK for a month. Used recently , unit would shut off on temperature, but pan cooled off enough, food would not cook. Bought this unit because of the Cuisinart name, very disappointed in this unit failing. I am assuming it is the control unit, but am not sure."
2,Did not work properly,"I find it almost funny that you are asking me to rate this product. I wanted a good, electric skillet and chose Cuisinart because of their reputation making higher quality cookware. (Or so I thought). I turned the skillet on and I never felt the oil got as hot as it should have. Even dropping a tiny drop of water in it barely caused a sizzle. I went ahead and added my meat and soon could tell my first suspicions were corrrect. My meat was barely cooking and NO, I did not crowd the skillet. It was then I noticed that one side of the skillet was barely hot. By this time I had raised the temperature to 400. The food surely should have been cooking by then. Again, how funny you ask me to rate this product. Didn't anyone notice I sent it back?"
2,Not a good product,"The merchandise was change for factory more that 4 times , this isnot a good material, the quality control is not a control the products , my problem was with the electrical plug was a fire, I am not recomend this product at this time, the delivery was at time ; I brought at the end the same product in Ebay at this time I am not have any problem; I spect a good product but is wasn't ."
5,Cuisinart CSK-150 1500-Watt Nonstick Oval Electric Skillet,"I LOVE IT!!!!! HEATS QUICKLY AND EVENLY. VERY EASY CLEAN UP.EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US, THE SIZE HAS BEEN PERFECT.LOVE THE GLASS LID. HEAVY CONSTRUCTION. EVEN THOUGH IT HEATS UP TO400 DEGREES, I HAVE HAD IT BOILING AY 250 DEGREES. THIS IS A REALREVIEW -- SO GLAD I DIDN'T GO THE ONE OF THE BIG BOX CHAINSAND BUY A CHEAP ONE."
1,It hums terriably,I received this skillet and used it about 4 times within the 30 days time limit that Amazon allows to return items and the humming kept getting worst. My time was up to return to Amazon so I contacted the Manufacturer. They told me I could return for a replacement but would have to pay freight both ways!! I would not recommend using this Manufacturer because they do not stand behind their product 100%. It is a faulty product and I have to pay extra(freight both ways) to get it replaced when I have only used 4 times.Ater posting this Amazon issued a return authorization to return at thier expense. Amazons customer service is the best. If the manufacturer will not back their product Amazon does. I rate Amazon a 5 star plus and Cuisinart a minus 1!!!
2,"Great for 3 Years, Then...","I loved this Cuisinart electric skillet for 3 years. It is attractive, seemingly well-built, cleaned up easily and did a great job cooking.Then, after three years of use (not real frequent use - maybe once a week on average, if not less), the thermostat stopped working. Like some other negative reviewers here, I discovered that all of a sudden it started cooking everything on the highest possible temperature, no matter what temperature I dialed in on the thermostat.Given the cost of this unit compared to most others on the market, I would have thought it would last longer than (coincidentally) it's warranty period (i.e., 3 years). I would NOT buy another one."
5,Great value for an electric skillet.,The coating in the electric skillet seems to be very high quality. This has been the problem with previous skillets that we would just throw away. This one seems to be a winner.
2,WEAK,I received this skillet and the bottom of the skillet was dimpled in about 5 places. i sent it back. Looked very very thin for a base. For the cost its not worth it. Poor quality control.
2,Quit after maybe 10 uses,I have had this product for less than a year and ised it less than a dozen times. I thought this skillet was okay. Didn't like the noise each time it heated. But last night it would not brown the tenderloin medallions at 450 degrees. I guess with a 30 day return policy I'm stuck. I thought I would like not worrying about immersing this skillet. I washed by hand never in a sink of water. Can't recommend this product.
2,Disappointing Electric Frying pan,"I like the way the frying pan cooks however, whenever the heat comes on, it is very noisy. My daughter has the same pan and it doesn't make the same noise."
1,Worked One Time,"We used the skillet one time and it failed to heat the second time we tried to use it, it looked well built but failed to cook."
2,Cuisinart Electric Skillet,Good if you don't intend to use the lid. Liquids are expelled around the lid.Will use for pancakes etc.D Hagen
5,Cuisinart electric skillet is fabulous,This is the finest electric skillet I have ever owned. I use it almost every day and will never purchase another brand.
2,Noisy!,"I purchased this unit and used it right away. Is was extremely noisy when cycling on, and the heat temperature got lower the longer it was on, even though I had it on at the highest setting. I assumed it must have been a factory defect, and returned it for an exchange from Amazon. Amazon was great, they actually sent me a new one before I had the chance to send the old one back, and they paid for the shipping. When I got the new skillet, it was just as noisy, but it heats properly. I am very dissapointed as it was a bit costly. The noise really is disturbing, it's loud, and I wouldn't want to have it on if I had company over. I decided to keep it, but was happier with my old $30 Westbend."
1,Cuisinart CSK 150-1500 Watt Nonstick Oval Electric Skillet,I purchased this skillet 3/17/2009 and on 4/27/09 the leg fell off when washing the skillet. I have taken extreme care with this skillet and perhaps used it 20 times. I would think twice on this one.
2,nonstick is a myth,"Hard to clean, water gets in the bottom vents when you hand-clean it...but the biggest problem is that ""non-stick"" is a myth, even bacon stuck to the cooking surface, tossed it out and am replacing, Cuisinart used to be top quality, but in recent years the quality has suffered."
2,Poor thermostat,"We bought this to replace our 16"" Presto. We went do the more expensive Cuisinart, because the less expensive models seem to lose their non-stick coating quickly. We've had to by a new skillet annually. We used the Cuisinart for a week and have returned it. A pan of bacon should not take an hour to cook. We turned the thermostat up to 450 and it finally worked, but it just isn't performing like we expected, especially in light of the cost. Since there are other reviews with concerns of the temperature control, we're going back to the cheaper model. The non-stick coating does work very well and the handles stayed cool to the touch. Seems to be well made, beyond the thermostat issue. Disappointing that this fundamental piece was not well designed."
3,over rated,"I was the main person to go for this expensive skillet even though my wife does the most cooking. We have been through three different electric skillets and unhappy with all of them, so thought paying a lot more would be better... WRONG. It does heat well and the food doesn't stick, but, the whole bottom bulges up so all the cooking oil migrates to the outer edge and the middle has a tendency to burn the food. The only way to remedy this is to keep about a half inch of oil in the skillet. I don't think I would buy one again, may stick to cheaper ones and just throw them away... if this one ever breaks down"
4,Oh Dear!! Dagwood has another plan!,"This sequel in the popular Blondie series is one that couples today can relate to. Dagwood decides to go to college, and it's up to Blondie to go along with him to keep him out of trouble. Dagwood and Blondie put Baby Dumpling in military school and keep their marriage a secret, but that not so easy when Blondie is noticed by the school's sports jock. Dagwood tries to compete by joining the rowing team, which gets him noticed by the most popular girl in school. With Blondie's jealousy and her missing Baby Dumpling, it's up to her to make the decision to stay in school or go home. This is a classic Blondie movie where Blondie is usually right, but she lets Dagwood thinks it's his idea."
2,Old-outdated make-up,"This is what I ordered, in the color I wanted, but it seemed like it was past the use date. That's probably why I could find it only online and it was not available in the stores any longer. It had a very weird odor. Would not recommend. Use make-up with BB in it."
1,Coffee WARMER is right,"This one does exactly what the name implies...its keeps coffee warm, and only marginally warm at that. This is about the 5th warmer I've bought and, by far, the worst one I've ever had. Coffee needs to be HOT - not luke warm.Save your $10 and use it to buy a real cup warmer. And spend the extra dollars to get one with auto shut-off."
5,Takes care of business.,"It warms your cup and keeps it warm all day long. Although it does not have an automatic shut off, it's still a great little unit for the money. Grab one up for a co-worker!"
2,List of problems with this device-,"1 - You have to choke up on your club because you are hitting off a raised platform. This is not a good idea when you're working on your swing.2 - The hitting surface is small and fairly lightweight, it often moves after you hit the ball.3 - The hitting surface is made out of fiberboard (pressed paper-like layers of wood). After many many swings, not all of them perfect, the bracket supporting the swinging ball has begun to rip off the hitting platform.I can not recommend the purchase of this product."
2,A poor swing training aid,"I bought one of these units from the local Target store. It doesn't give very good feedback on the golf swing as it advertises. The plastic stakes that come with the unit do a poor job of anchoring it during use, and it tends to come loose, which is annoying -- I've tried placing bricks on the base, which doesn't work much better. This is one of the many golf swing trainers that don't do much good, and after using it a few times, it ends up in the garage or the basement with all the other unused junk. I say that your money would be better spent on a few buckets of golf balls at the range to improve your golf swing."
3,Personal Ethics: It's up to you,Ok film. Out of date information for a product that was dated 5/2012. Wasn't very impressed with it. Somewhat appropriate for a teenage audience.
5,Against the Backdrop of WWII,Stephen Sprague hadn't paid much attention to his English relatives until he and his sister Sylvia (a talented team not unlike Fred and Adele Astaire) head for London to open a new show. There he meets and falls in love with his cousin Evadne Campion. Their romance is complicated by Evadne's unpleasant cousin Hermione and the threat of war from Germany.
3,Pleasant historical novel,"I thought this book was the weakest of the series, probably because the main female character was not as likeable. The setting in Britain in World War II was very well done, and the book does make a nice transition for Homing. If you have read all the others, you need to read this one."
1,"Yeah, right.",These digital monsters want to kill Pokemon. They're ugly when they evolve. They're rubbish.
3,*** out of 5 stars:OK anime but pokemon it is not.,"Better than pokemon!Yeah right for one thing Pokemon has more creativity because unlike digimon all the names of the pokemon do not end in ""mon"".Although it does has some good humor and such it's still a palid attempt to pokemon.And yes pokemon did came 1st it was 1st introduced in the 70's as a comic book in japan.Even though it's certainly not the worst in anime it's far from the best.And don't expect this show to have a feature flick anytime soon."
2,will some one tell me some cheats,I would like some one to write to me and please give me some cheats for my digimon if you have can you please send them to michaelj88@hotmail.com thank you.
5,Digimon are the best!,"This is a must for all fans of the cute little monsters from the digital world. It shows how the whole adventure to save two worlds started.Althought there is a popular belief that Digimon is a ripoff of Pokemon, that couldn't be further from the truth. Digimon is amazingly creative and original, and as an adult, I find that it reminds me of my favorite cartoons from my childhood. It has all of the elements of a classic cartoon: A progressive adventure, characters that kids can relate to, catchy theme music, super cute animation, and a moral to each story.Digimon is a lot of fun for both kids and adults. This is one of the few modern cartoons you can enjoy sitting down and watching with your kids.The series starts out a little slow and cheesey as they try and establish the basics and show you the ropes for the Digital world.. but things pick up quickly, and eventually every episode makes you hungry to find out what happens next."
5,Pikachu Vs. Elecmon...Don't make me laugh!,"Digimon like pokemon they say? While the similarities do add up, Digimon is by far a better series. First of all, the children are FAR FAR better (and more intelligent I might add) than what the doofuses from pokemon dish out. With a great storyline (it actually has a storyline as opposed to pokemon) and good villains it outclasses pokemon by far and stands on its own as a great show for younger kids, adults who enjoy watching it with their kids and anyone who likes Japanese Monster cartoons in general.P.S. While I love Pikachu as much as anybody, almost every mon in the digiverse (with obvious exceptions) could beat their equivalents in the pokemon world."
4,"Excellent, far better than any Pokemon video.","In this vid, 7 kids are swept from their home to a strange island inhabited by creatures called Digimon. They make friends with seven of these Digimon who defend them from evil Digimon. The plot is far better than that of Pokemon. After all, Pokemon is ultimately unrealistic in that an Animal Rights group would have sprung up to stop all matches by now :). In Digimon it is about kids who are trying to find their way home. All Digimon adventures are excellent."
5,Excellent animation!,"I, too, diagree with the official rating; digimon is not at all like pokemon, and I've argued it so many times over the web. First of all, Digimon came first, believe it or not. Second, the plot and goal of the series is different then pokemon, like it or not. I can go on about it, but I don't have the space. Digimon is really cool, and is good for all ages and is definately worth watching. I saw it once and now I'm hooked on it, so I suggest that all of you try it, too. You'll like it!"
2,Digimon,I must say at first i hated Digimon but when the series went longer into the story i started to like it. It is a very good show and i think it is way better then pokemon. This show is for more grown up kids while pokemon is for little babies.
4,A cool beginning to a cool show,"...I like this movie--I'm glad that someone had the sense to put the episodes into a film. The voices are slightly different than they are later in the season, (probably because the voice actors are just getting used to their parts) but that doesn't change the overall effectivness of the video.The characters are fun, the Digimon are interesting, and the Digiworld and Digivices are intriguing. The common prefix 'Digi' may seem tiresome at first, but you'll grow to get used to it. (I think...)All in all, I think that this is a decent example of anime and a good beginning to the Digimon show."
5,Digimon Rocks!,"This is a great intro to the Digimon storyline (if you missed the first episodes esp.) Digimon has a better plot than Pokemon, and IMHO the values it promotes are more beneficial to younger viewers; i.e.= love,friendship,hope,etc. Don't get me wrong: Pokemon has those values too(!) but Digimon shows it more actively. I will say that the animation is a little quaky in these 1st episodes, but believe me, it gets A LOT better in the enseuing ones. Slightly older kids will probably like this one b/c of the bigger badder monsters, and parents might want something that doesn't have legions of toys behind it. If they continue releasing these movies with Angemon (he's hands down the COOLEST Angel I've seen)and Myotismon, they'll win you over."
1,Poor Life span,Dewalts 24V. Batteries only last about 35 -40 charge cycles before they die. That's from my experience of owning 6 of them all bought over a time span to have purchased all of there improved models and they all preformed the same.
2,Dewalt 24 volt batteries,"I bought the entire line of Dewalt 24 volt cordless tools. That includes the power saw, drill driver and saws all. I am impressed with the tools but the batteries suck. the original batteries lasted two years with constant use as I have my own contracting business. After the batteries failed I sent them to BatteryPackRebuilders.com, even though I am sure they do a good rebuilding job the batteries only last about a year but it's less than half the price of a new battery. Being in the construction business it's a real pain to be sending batteries back for rebuilding. If you're in the construction business you have to have at least double the 24 volt batteries you need because half are always out being rebuilt. I would really like to see Dewalt come out with a lithium ion battery replacement for the 24 volt line of tools as the cordless tools are awesome except for the original batteries."
3,Love/Hate This system,"First off, let me say that I have owned several DeWalt 24 Volt tools for nearly 10 years and have been VERY impressed with the power and durability of the tools. The battery IMHO, is another story, although I have attempted to treat them with some care, I have experienced numerous failures. Perhaps this modified design will improve matters somewhat, I have had this one about 6 months and it is holding up well."
2,Potentially Problematic for Young Christian Readers,"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an important Indian leader whose leadership in overthrowing British rule became an inspiration for the American Civil Rights movement. This picture-book biography presents the major events of his life with Demi's characteristically beautiful illustrations. For the purpose of nurturing a Christian worldview, this book may be problematic. Gandhi's human greatness was inseparable from his Hindu faith, and the text is infused with a Hindu view of reality, along with quotes from the Bhagavad Vita. Young children will probably be unable to separate the spiritual aspects of the story from the qualities that earned Ghandi's reputation as a ""Great Soul."" Our family will have to wait until a later, more sophisticated age to introduce this important human figure to our children."
4,great illistrations,This book like other men at arms series books is filled with great illistrations but if you just want info get another book.
2,Needs Updating,No disrespect to the author who has contributed much to the study of military history but this book is a good example of how time catches up with one. See my reviews of the new indepth five volume set on the German Army.With a few exceptions all of the volumes numbered under one hundred in this series on modern twentieth century forces have become outdated. The publisher's original emphasis on stuffing a broad scope of basic information in a standard format for the benefit of wargamers and military miniature makers has now changed to studies of particular campaigns and finite periods of selected unit activities and dress for study in the detailed depth they deserve. This volume is just too simplistic to be of much use to the general reader and very little to the specialist almost twenty years on.
3,Not so good at all,"With all respect for the others reviewers, the illustrations on this, otherwise good, book are not as good as others in Men-at-Arms. Their colors looked blurred to me. The ones in this series German Army books are much better.The text is very comprehensive and gives a lot of information."
1,Right out of the Middle Ages,"If you are a very severe fundamentalist Orthodox Jew, you might like it. I didn't care for all the hate propaganda, stonings and whiplashing recommended for those who break minor commandments. I found it hard to believe that G-d would like it, either. The choice is, of course, yours."
5,Excellent Taste & No Sugar,"I use to buy this at health food stores and some supermarkets at a higher cost of course. This granola has an excellent and tangy flavor, is filling, and as I said has no sugar of any kind. It's sweet enough as it is with just the dried raspberries. Umm good and tasty indeed!"
5,Best Granola!,"I absolutely love this granola! It is both delicious and healthy. With 33 grams of Whole Grains, 4 grams of fiber, and 5 grams of protein in each 1/2 cup serving, it packs a nutritional powerhouse with a fantastic flavor! I like it best after a workout with a 1/2 cup of milk and banana chopped up in it. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I'm sure they will be equally as delicious!"
5,A Bird Lover in the West,It is just a lovely read. Her encounter with the wrens at Cheyenne Mountain was just like being in my backyard. These little birds have not changed over these many years since this book was written.
2,Suitable for the Young Horse Lover,"If you have a young equine enthusiast around, this book would make a nice gift. Photos are artfully done in the style of Robert Vavra. Very little content for the adult reader. Poor breed reference book. Binding on the book buried several nice photos. Paper quality took away form others."
3,Prada Bag review,Bag was nice price very worth it. But the color reflected was not too accurate. Packaging was atrocious. I am charged based on volumetric wt and for such a small bag the box was humongous
4,Works good,"Having used my MIO 269 for about a month, I am very satisfied with its performance. The user interface is not intuitively obvious but after using the device and referring to the User Manual a few times, I really like its abilities. It has never failed to lead me to my destination and quickly recalculates new routes when I choose a different route than suggested. The maps are a little outdated (2004?) and I am trying to find out how to get updated maps, if possible. Overall, I am very happy with the GPS device but it was a little frustrating at first figuring out how to use it. Having purchased mine for only $199, I'm not complaining. I believe I got a lot for the money. The only major drawback I have is that you can't use the MP3 player at the same time as the GPS."
1,"Nice idea, but...","Pros: Nice hardware / form factor design.Cons: Allows you to enter contacts, but no routing from those contacts; inaccurate maps (even in areas that haven't changed in decades); thin POI database; device time not set by GPS; silly keyboard interface (why should I have to cycle through three keyboards just to enter a numerical address?); inaccurate ETA/ETR calculations; navigation lost when travelling on region boundaries; inaccurate touch-screen registration on some menu entries; turn notification at the exact point of the turn (couldn't it give a little more notice based on current velocity?)... There are more.Other Thoughts: I bought this in July 2005, because I liked the physical design and I fly a lot, needing to carry a GPS with me. If you need a GPS that fits nicely in your laptop bag when you travel, *and* you're willing to put up with a junk UI, this is your device. If you want a nice UI, try another brand."
1,THIS CRADLE DOES NOT WORK FOR THE PSP SLIM/LITE,"It looked pretty sweet when I got it, but was very dissapointed that it only works for PSP Phat. THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR THE PSP LITE/SLIM MODEL. It's my mistake for thinking that it would. I would change the description to say this does not work for the PSP Slim model. I'm going to try and sell it locally."
1,I got ripped off,This product is not compatible with PSP's at all. It was a good idea but it does not fit the measurements for the system.
5,Movie Dock Great,The sound quality was great. The ease of use is wonderful. It is worth having for the price.
1,Cheap,"I was excited about this product. But when I got it nothing worked, accept the sound and only with the battaries. I was very disappointed I send it right back the next morning. Next!"
3,Works for a bit,"I brought this cage from Walmart a little over two years ago. It was a great cage for a while then the wheel began containing moisture somehow and it would produce a really bad smell. So I had to disconnect it. Valona still likes her house but she can't get her excersize because there is no place to put in a new wheel. Now the entire cage is holding in moisture and is producing this acrid odor. So I'm looking for a new cage. Perferably one that's not made of plastic. In short, it's a nice cage if you need something in a hurry kinda like I did, but be warned."
5,Amen!!!!!!!,Truth matured greatly with this album. I can't stop listening to it. The production is TOP NOTCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Words can not describe how this album is. Crossmovement Records is on point and im soo glad they've been releasing album after album this year. From The Phanatik to The Ambassador OMG!!!!!!! I am soooooo amazed at how far Truth has come in his writing skills. The album pushes BIBLICALLY SOUND CHRISTIAN HIP HOP to the next level. I am hoping Tonic is well enough to release his album.The Crossmovement Family has done it again!!
4,Lyrically Gifted,"This lyrically gifted rapper has put out another cd to help keep me grounded spiritually in my walk. The production is great as well. The songs here are of top notch quality. If you need Christan Rap to replace the secular, roll with this. Peace"
4,Great Sophmore Release,"I didn't like this cd the first time I listened to it. But ended up buying it for one of the songs ""Stand."" After giving it another try, Every song sounded better and better. I really took notice to how well it was produced. But still can't listen to ""Conversations"" or ""Portrait."" Just don't care for them. In fact my favorite song on the cd now would have to be the bonus track ""They,"" after the song ""Whose Team?"""
5,Da Truth Did it Again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This cd is lyrically fire and better than most secular artist out there's cd. Da Truth is really talented and people better watch cause christian hip hop is off and popping. God bless
5,Great album,Every song on this album is reppin' Christ to the fullest. Da Truth is definitely one the best Christian hip hop artists out there. Love this cd!!!
3,Much Appreciated,"I like several songs from this album. The Portrait is my favorite. However, the deliveries of some of the songs are too repetitive in its rhythm so it becomes a little irritating. The DJ Official track is a good example. The beat is classic. The lyrics are well thought out and cleaver. However, the delivery is very repetitive."
5,talking caller id,"I had this talking caller id phone from panasonic for many years. It's a good phone. However it can be a little annoying when somebody call your house late at night, but it gives you the option of turning this feature off. I got tired of it oneday and turned it off then realized how much I became dependent on hearing who was calling before I answered the call. I love it so much I brought another one."
4,"Well, It Does the Job","Very good map, which shows the Himalaya region in excellent detail. Easy to read, moderately easy to fold. When I read a novel, I like to locate the towns and highways mentioned in the book on a map. Gives me more of a sense of feel about the book's setting. This map did the job, as I read about Francis Younghusband, noted explorer (and exploiter) of Tibet. It would have been nice if the map had a gazeteer, but I gues you can't get everything on a map. Anyhow, this map was well worth the money."
5,This book is worth five stars and more...,"This book is just what the title says: A complete program in the arts of Shaolin. It includes information on Shaolin Kung-Fu, Qiqong (including the Shaolin perspectives), and many additional topics. This book is probably the most inclusive book on Shaolin that exists at this moment. If you are interested in learning more about the arts of Shaolin, or if you just want to know more about them, buy it."
3,3 1/2 stars,"I watched this with 5 friends. The movie is well made considering how hard it must have been to portray so many people in such a small space. It kept us watching until the end, but nobody ""loved"" it. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
5,A breath of fresh sounds to your ears.,"How appropriate is it for this CD to be titled ""Breathe New Life."" Rhonda Thomas and her vocal skills have brought a breath of fresh sounds to the jazz vocals and R&B; genre. To taut a cliché, she is a ""bundle of dynamite"" when performing and the boom is in her powerful voice. Just as she demonstrates the strength of her voice, she can show the subtleties on Ballards. My favorite tracks are 3, 8, 9 and 11. But you won't be disappointed if you just let it play through.The title track ""Breathe New Life"" and ""Just a Phase"" are featured on the soundtrack for the book ""Ghettoway Weekend.""Ghettoway Weekend"
2,"Not my style, over","Have seen all 5 star reviews above, I picked up this book from school's library.After skim through it, I don't think I can finish it.well, maybe it is ""well"" written, but what I am looking for is easy-to-understand, hands-on book which can give me examples of how to attack real problems. This book doesn't provide any of that for me.Maybe because it is written by two math professors? and I don't know why it receive all 5 star reviews."
2,"Watch out, Cheap Pieces","Our whole family loves Shrek & Shrek 2, but we were disapointed with this game. It was almost exactly like Monopoly Jr, the theme-based changes very minor. So the play is fun & educational.However, the tokens (Shrek, Fiona, etc) are made from cheap cardboard and have little plastic stands that holds the cardboard characters up. I had to glue the cardboard characters to the stands so they would stay in place during play. My kids are gentle, but these would just fall out on their own."
5,Fun for all ages!,"My son received this game from a friend on his 7th birthday. He loves it! It's a nice way to introduce your child to board games. It's simple enough, but also challenging enough, to keep his interest. It's a great family game!"
3,Disappointed In This One,"I was disappointed in this book. Although the author has some cute ideas on combining stickers, there isn't a lot new here. I didn't need to read the introduction to know this had to be someone who worked with the Creative Memories philosophy: use lots of pictures on white pages and get those albums done! A lot of folks love CM, and I see its advantages. However, I prefer more varied backgrounds and didn't expect this to be CM slanted. It's a well made book with lots of color but not at all what I hoped for."
5,"10-Minute Scrapbook Pages:Hundreds of Easy,Innovative Design","Of all of the scrapbook idea books I have purchased and read, this one has the easiest, fastest ways and ideas to get the pages done! The ideas are fresh and easy to adapt and FAST!"
1,Disappointed - Not inspired,I was disappointed in the lack of creativity shown in the layouts and photography. The stock photography looked very dated. I have seen better layouts featured on line by amatuers. There are much better books and periodicals out there.
3,10-Minute Scrapbook Pages Review,This book helped me to design new and great pages for my scrapbook. I enjoyed reading it and would love to see another like it with new ideas.
2,HAHAHA,And I'm still laughing. This movie is really horrible. Is it supposed to be horror or soft core porn? I'm not sure which but either way it has the plot for both. I bought this movie years ago and decided to watch it tonight because I really have no life. The only thing good about this movie is Buckethead's music and that is the only reason I bought it in the 1st place.If you like cheesy horror with nakie girls and awesome music then you might like this.
1,Love it or Hate it,"I suspect that this is one of those Love it Or Hate it films.I'm not a Gore-hound, in fact some great Horror has had very little gore.This Film starts out with a Brilliant Story line, and just trashes it. If the Script was redone and had the supernatural line done properly ( and Photographed better), then the film would work, in my view.However, I like Attack of Killer Tomatoes, so you never can tell about taste.Actually, This is one film since I viewed John Cassavetes in INCUBUS, which I would say to anyone who asked... ""Don't Bother""... there are far better and far scarier films around, and ones that have better sound too."
3,She got that Drew Barrymore thang goin' on,"Terry West puts together a late night Cinemax gone horror movie about a haunted house and an amulet in a skull. The dialogue is pretty trite and forced, as is the plot, but the great part of this movie is Drew Barrymore look-alike Jane Scarlett. She plays timid psychic Erin Cooper, whose alter-ego succubi seduces geeks and yells, 'F*ck me HARDER!'. For any 30-something male, its like the sweet girl next door (who you saw in ET and Firestarter) grew up to be really sexy with a sailor's mouth. Who knows where Terry will end up-remember that Robert Ebert (of Siskell + Ebert and Ebert + Roper) did write the screenplay for Russ Meyer's 'Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens'."
2,Victor Flynn is a Great Actor,"I was able to catch ""Flesh for The Beast"" in a theater. Can I just say this: Victor Flynn is one of the greatest actors of our generation and on DVD I can watch his performance over and over.This kid is going to be a superstar one day."
1,This is a coperate rip-off!,"Mearly a Bring it Back Alive redo. Only thing missing is the endings to half the songs. Nothing new here. To simply fade out a song half way through is an injustice to the band, the buyer, and the seller who may not know. I will never buy anything that says Extended Versions. Thats the long way of saying rip-off!"
1,Ripped off,"I made the mistake of buying this CD based on the title ""Extended Versions"". Actually, that's an oxymoron. This CD is the ""Bring It Back Alive"" CD, but with SHORTENED versions of the songs, not ""extended"" ones. Apparently Extended Versions is a series from this music label, I've seen CDs in the store by other artists, now, that all have this same title. Don't buy it, buy the other CD. Or if you already have that, save your money."
4,What a Treat !,"The Outlaws are one the best performers on stage. I saw them perform at an outdoor venue in St. Louis, opening for the Charlie Daniels Band, probably in 2006 or 2007. Their ""on stage"" performance blew CDB away, not that Charlie Daniels wasn't in top form, but you could have been listening to ""the record"". The Outlaws, on the other hand, were jamming their ""as**s off, just like they do on this cd. The only disappointment on this cd is the ""fading out of tracks"" isn't the greatest. A True Fan will overlook the enginneer's editing performance, and kick back and enjoy the music. If you ever get a chance to see The Outlaws perform live, GO! These guys are truly exciting performers."
5,Fantastic First Film,"The bottom line here is this is an amazing film debut. Dale Resteghini has put forth the effort to qualify him to placed in the hierchy of first time filmmakers such as Spike Lee, Francis Ford Coppola, Steve Soderberg and Ed Burns. This is not an exploitive video director trying to be a feature film director turn in any form. Well done young man!"
3,Disappointing,"I have just finished this book and found the story a little far-fetched. Read it only if you are a Murder, She Wrote fan. Otherwise, it honestly is not worth your time."
1,This Was Awful!,"As a long time fan of Murder She Wrote there is only one word to describe this novel, awful! It would seem that this book was written by someone who had never read the rest of the series. The plot consisted of hypnotism and a bizarre government mind-control conspiracy, I kept waiting for the logical solution but it never came! The recurring characters didn't ring true and some were missing altogether (like the Sheriffs wife Maureen). All in all, not only don't I recommend reading this book, I strongly recommend not reading this book!On a Happier Note, if you read and were disapointed in this book don't let it disillusion you try: Gin and Daggers or Murder on the QE2!"
2,Sizzle to Fizzle,"This book starts out superbly and ends most horribly. The ending feels increasingly rushed, which holds no satisfaction for the reader. Without spoiling the plot for those unfortunate enough to read it, this book is a great read... until you reach about 2/3 of the way through. The book falls apart. Mr. Bain starts using characters that were only slightly introduced earlier in the book and characters that he had invested quite a bit of time in, page-wise, suddenly leave. Reality takes a header out the window by the last few pages and the murderer(s) never get final justice... which is probably the most necessary component to a murder mystery, imho.I highly recommend Fletcher & Bain's first novel, Gin & Daggers, as an example of a very good Murder, She Wrote book."
4,Inside a Prediential Election,"Bob Woodward did a great job of giving us a view of what the candidates and their families have to go through during the political process of getting elected. All the decisions that must be made. From whether or not to even run. When to announce, who to hire on staff, raising fuds and advertising. Woodward had direct contact and interviews with all the candidates excpet Clinton. Where he had to rely on the President's staff and friends.The book covers all the candidates that try for the nomination, including those that would have been considered but chose not to run. A very interesting insight into the process of running for our most powerful elected office. The book eventually comes down to the campign between Dole and Clinton.Woodward is known for being very accurate and tapes all his interviews. This is the first book of his that I have read. And I will now try to pick up and read the Agenda next."
3,What choice?,"What makes Bob Woodward such a prominent author and journalist is his ability to get behind the scenes of important events and key people and report them to mass audiences. In ""The Choice,"" Woodward's talent is handicapped in several respects. First, the subject matter - the early rounds of the 1996 presidential election- is only mildly interesting. Second, much of Woodward's information was already public knowledge at the time of the book's release. Finally, the author is so caught up in getting the ""inside story,"" he loses sight of the election's broad themes. He loses the big picture. A respectable work but there are better books about this subject."
2,WAIT AND LISTEN!,"I was so surprised when open up the package and found this little tiny book in a box. I was telling my wife not to judge from its size, but the content. I read all reviews before buying this book and all of them rated 5 stars. So I had pictured myself playing with my lovely retriever follow this traning guide. I started reading the book pages after pages and I could not find anything worth for the price of the book. This book cost more than $60! I do not think the content worth more than $20. I bought other books recently about Golden retriever and one of my favorite is the dummy. It provides the same info as in this book and other info you need to raise the dog from a puppy to adult. Most importantly, it is worth the price. You can also find the same info from the animal channel. There are few programs about dog training and it is far better than this book."
3,Another VERSION of NY & Boston Shows,"This is a live cd featuring: 1.Real Wild Child, 2.Blah Blah Blah, 3.Some Weird Sin, 4.China Girl, 5.Lust For Life, 6.Nightclubbing, 7.Five Foot One, 8.Shades, 9.No Fun, 10.I Wanna Be Your Dog. That set list makes me think it is a concert from the Ritz in New york in 1986, except for ""No Fun"", which sounds like it is from the Channel in Boston in 1988. If you have ""Live Ritz N.Y.C."" & ""Live In NYC"" & any of the many versions of the Boston concert, you don't need this. Of course, it's really cheap, so it's not a big deal if you're collecting everything, like I am. The 3 stars is cause it's not from a great time in Iggy's career, & I get tired of all the repackaging."
5,A NEW AND VERY GOOD STORY,I think CAROLE BERRY is an up and coming mystery writer. I have read everything she has wrote and can't wait for more.
1,boring,"Rodney Dangerfield is funny in small doses. This movie was just not that funny, unless you are the fan of oneliners repeated every few seconds. Will donate this one to the used book sale in town."
4,Is it real or Rodney?,"Typically Rodney, it's got more funny moments than not. What wasn't known when ordered is that this is actually a movie, and not one of his stand-up comedies. It's still great for Rodney fans."
1,"Hate this movie, Love Rodney!","OMG, it sounded like it would be so funny but it was the worst Rodney movie I have ever seen. Boring and not Funny at all!"
5,"I could give this movie more stars, it was hillarious",As usual Rodney Dangerfield was one of the funniest comedians in the business. The Movie was full of his hillarious one-liners. Definately a movie you should add to your collection. And at a nice price...
3,Good movie. :),Rodney was really good in this movie.It's not as commercialized as Back To School but there's no reason to forget about it.AND it didn't cost me over $3! :)
4,Classic Rodney,"Not the best Rodney Dangerfield film, but funny. Rodney carries this movie with his oneliners, other than that this movie probably wouldn't have much else to offer. Appearances by John Byner and Andrew ""dice"" clay too.If you're a fan of Rodney you'll enjoy it."
1,"More bigoted nonsense from the fake ""Colonel""","Why oh why doesn't Amazon have a rating below 1 star? It's *really* needed for trash like this.Firstly Donn de Grand Pre (not his real name of course) isn't a Colonel and never has been. He's been outed as a fake for years. Hell, he can't even keep his story straight....As for being a Pentagon/Government insider, well that's more lies.Anyway on to the book. It's rubbish. An incoherent failure to link a bunch of nonsensical (and contradictory) conspiracy theories leavened with the usual anti-semitism and bigotry. If you're a ""believer"" in such idiocy (911 was carried out by the US Government and/or Mossad, the CFR is part of a plot to control the world, ""chemtrails"" are real, the Trilateral commission is evil, Jews faked the Holocaust to create the state of Israel or any of the white power rubbish) you'll like this book.But it's still lies, written by a proven liar."
5,Real Value!,"It is not often that a small inexpensive book provides a valuable in-depth account of a battle. When that happens, I feel that I have cheated the author by getting much more than I paid for. Eric J. Wittenberg often gives me this feeling. This is an invaluable account of the cavalry battles that maintained the Union right flank. This is the best book on this action that I have found, clearly written with good maps and photos."
4,Quality product,"Attractive kitchen appliance that looks good if left on the counter top. Solid, but not too heavy, the stainless steel construction makes it easy to clean and the detachable base make cleaning the cooking surface a breeze. Have not tried all cooking temperatures yet but the settings seem more than adequate and the few meals we cooked were delicious.Would have given this product five stars except for the fact that the large Cuisinart sticker on the stainless steel cover left a dull finish under the newly exposed area after I removed it. Of course others may choose to leave it on and avoid this, I just don't like advertising on products I buy. Too soon to comment on reliability but do not anticipate any problem given the reputation of Cuisinart and the apparent quality construction of this applicance."
5,Wish I had discovered KHT a long time ago!,"A long time ago a friend from work lent me the book Strange Brew, which I immediately loved and I was determined to begin the Callahan Garrity series in chronological order. I breezed through this in 2 days and found it to be a fast, fun read. I definitely plan to continue with the rest of the Callahan Garrity series. The concept of running a housecleaning business while solving murder mysteries is a very good one. The other characters also play a major part in the story, beginning with Callahan's mom Edna as well as the 'girls' that work for their House Mouse cleanup biz, plus Bucky Deaver, a cop that Callahan used to work with when she was a police officer on the Atlanta force. If you like mysteries where the main character has both intelligence and a sense of humor, then you can't go wrong with this series. Very highly recommended."
2,the language is really unnecessary!,"this book is a great mystery and really the only problem I have with it and the writer is the crude language. I really don't think you need all that language just to sound authentic. Most people read to get away from real life. You don't have to have so much of that in the books as well. This is the only reason why I could not, in good conscience, give the book more than 2 stars. Sorry."
1,"Lacks wit, suffers from a boring plot","I read this book because I was looking for a well-written, humorous mystery with a female sleuth. I was sorely disappointed however because the only thing funny about the book was the author's horrible research about the LDS church, which lacked accuracy and authenticity to point that it was almost silly. The novel doesn't really clear up misconceptions about the faith as much as it propagates them. The plot was also slow moving and repetitive. Most of the characters were not very memorable or even likable. If you want to read something with an engaging, humorous plot stick to Janet Evanovich."
4,Light mystery/suspense,"Former cop, now cleaning service business owner Callahan, runs into crime when she takes on a cleaning job at a former classmate's ritzy home. Often amusing with the characters, although no Evanovich. I enjoyed that it wasn't chock full of steamy romance. Will probably read a few more in the series when in the mood for something very light ;-)"
3,Great Title - Sort of Predictable,"Great Title and an easy read. However, if you're looking for a challenge..this book is sort of predictable."
4,Nice taste of the islands,"It was great to find this drink on Amazon, after we returned from a cruise to the Saint's islands. When we want to kick back and relax, my wife and I share a bottle of Ting and remember the catamaran trip with the wind, the smell of the ocean, the music and the fun.The drink itself would get a 5 star rating, no problems at all with the taste or packaging or anything along those lines. The problem keeping it from 5 star's is the shipping cost, it is way more than the cost of the drinks themselves.If I could buy Ting locally I would, but we haven't found it in the Houston area. It means, unfortunately, that we won't be ordering this too often, since the shipping cost is twice the cost of the Ting itself."
2,not good if you're looking for an overview,"I did not find this book very readable. I was looking for something at the jr. high level. This book spends a lot of time just going over the lineage, which I found dull. There were some interesting points about the structure of government, but presented in such a verbose manner that I found it hard to read. I only got about half way through it, although it is a rather short book."
2,sounds okay,"I have seen the cover box for this video on ebay. It looks kind of weird, thats probably because its in the everchanging style of the british boxes. This video will have the same director, narrator, music, and activities like Steamies vs. Diesels. I'm okay with that so long as they release normal videos with the music we love, no activities, and all of the characters. It looks like we should expect two normal videos and two wacked out videos like Steamies vs. Diesels per year. Thats okay, but HIT is a weird company. The stories should be okay, but that's it."
2,bad packaging - broken bulbs,"Ordered 10 of these bulbs. 8 of the 10 were bubble-wrapped and 2 were not. I think this was because they would not fit in the box otherwise. Well, the box was still bulging and the two bulbs that weren't bubble-wrapped did not work. Big disappointment at $9 per bulb!"
1,Burnt out after 1 week...,I have to admit I was completely disappointed from the very beginning with these light bulbs. First I ordered the exact same part number as I bought at Target and the base of the bulb was bigger than the other bulbs and they are not nearly as bright not to mention after one week of using these bulbs one has already burnt out. I am completely disappointed with this product and I order weekly if not daily from Amazon. Spend the extra dollar and go to Target or another seller for this bulb.
1,If Your A Catholic First Go To A Pro-Catholic Book,This book is very misleading. Catholics who want to know more about their faith should seek books written by Catholic writers. To pursue this book as a means of understanding your Catholic faith will only damage your understanding and weaken a faith that obviously is yearning for truth and understanding. Try some of Scott Hahn's books first.
5,Simple but Helpful,"I appreciated Tony Coffey's book, ""Once a Catholic,"" for it is simple, with a friendly tone, based on Scripture, and convincing to the honest-hearted reader. It is not thorough, and it was not intended to be. Yet it covers the subject adequately for the beginner. It does show that so much in Roman Catholicism is unscriptural, false, and rests on unbiblical and anti-Biblical tradition, rather than the authoritative teaching of Christ and the apostles. I highly recommend the book, although it is now out of print. I notice that Coffey has written a newer volume, ""Answers to Questions that Catholics are Asking,"" and I would assume that it also is very helpful."
1,If You're Looking For Bible Truth...,"and/or intellectual stimulation, DO NOT buy this book. It's basically the same tired, old anti-Catholic propaganda, EXCEPT, this one is actually written by an ex-Catholic who never even bothered to learn his own faith (if you can imagine that). If you are sincerely seeking God's truth, and desire works written by someone with honesty and integrity, then please read ""Born Fundamentalist, Born Again Catholic"", by David B. Currie."
1,anti-Catholic propoganda,"If you're looking for what Catholics really believe and why, this is the biggest waste of money ever! It's nothing but a bunch of sadly misguided anti-Catholic propoganda that isn't worth your valuable time...."
1,"Poorly researched, intellectually biased","Study the early church fathers with an open mind and you'll be pleasantly surprised, all you anti-Catholic Catholics (and others). I'd recommend Scott Hahn's books as a start. There is no substitute for an open mind and earnest, good faith study. This book supplies neither."
2,5O Ways To Rank Howard,"What ever record company put this out, basically took Howard's l982 album ''5O Ways To Rank Your Mother'' and re-packaged it poorly to capitalize on the coronation of Howard as the King 0f All Media. Sure the classic bits are here, but over all it's a poor copy of the original."
2,Howard Stern is a sick man,He makes very mean jokes about disabled people the mentally ill and Aunt Jemima
2,Very LOW quality fabric.,"Purchased this for a family member for Christmas and VERY disappointed in the quality of the fabric. It's made of a low quality cotton that wrinkles horribly and is scratchy, very much like a raw cotton. The bag arrived wrinkled, straps are folded long-wise on themselves and bent. I've had it hanging for a few days and the wrinkles haven't budged. Will be trying to iron it so it looks somewhat like the picture shown here. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
3,not as good as the mens book,the book was not as good as the mens did he or didn;t he. the guys dished more dirt then the ladies. guess the ladies just where a little more reserved.
3,Doesn't Go With the Title,"Really only two songs spark incredible praise in me (I Will Bless the Lord & Lift Him Up). I wouldn't really consider this a ""worship"" CD because there are many different styles of songs on this. The song choices don't really flow that well to me. Byron Cage is a great artist, but I expected more from this CD."
4,Needs more work,"I can only connect with maybe 3 songs on this album. They are good, dont get me wrong, but when you've heard worship and then you've heard WORSHIP your expectation is greater.He has some good worship songs and some lively songs of praise, but I think I've been too spoiled to really grab hold of this one."
5,Unbelievable Invitation!,"This is one invitation you do not want to turn down!! Byron Cage has an anointed voice and gift!! This CD is so powerful. I am really upset that more mainstream stations don't play his music. This CD lifted me up during a difficult time during the loss of my dad. I literally placed the CD in for the first time in November of 06 and it has been the only CD in my player for the past three months!! There is healing and salvation, joy and praise in this CD. Get it now!!!!"
5,Great window to the '50s,"This book shows the cars, fashions, music, TV shows, movies, how much things cost, and other delightful tidbits about the '50s. It tells a balanced view of those years, also describing the cold war and racial tensions of the time. If you were there and want to be taken back, or weren't there, but want to know what that decade was like, this is a swell, neato, keen book. I would also recommend Bill Bryson's book The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, which is autobiographical."
4,He's Back,"Great dvd for any Tupac fan to add to their collection. It featured all of Tupac's greatest hits except for ""2 of Americas most wanted"" featuring Snoop dogg. It showed all the new and old videos that he has made throughout his career, This collection consisted of some of his early underground videos that I had not seen before. Videos that he had before I really knew who he was. The company that made this dvd had the titles out of order on the cover. Every video is on there ,but not listed in the proper order to follow. The ""It's all about you"" video cuts off into another video, like it has ended, and then comes back on, out of no where. The people who made this video, I do not believe they had a clue on what they were doing. I thought it was weird how they showed all the videos, and then showed them all over again, but into little short clips. Besides the formatting issues, it is good to have just to stash in you collection."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am one of the biggest Tupac fans out there & try to get everything available. However, this was the biggest disappointment. The video quality is horrible; save your money!"
5,Great Country DVD,"This dvd is outstanding.It is the 2nd half of a terrific collaborationbetween some of the greatest country artist/songwriters of all time.From Willie Nelson to Bobby Bare,Gene Watson to B.J.Thomas and withBarbara Fairchild/Janie Fricke it was a joy to watch and listen to.Theysing all great songs and tell many stories from their past.Well worththe time & money. And Vol 1 is just as good."
5,Awesome,If you like country music. You won't be disappointed with Ralph Emery's Country LegandsBoth volume 1 & 2.The country music is well worth the money
5,Country Legends,These Country Legend DVD's are the best. Watched them when they were live on TV and have wanted to see the show again. We have talked about the show over the years and I'm so glad I found them in time for Father's Day. We would buy more of the Country Legend DVDs if they were available.
1,Loved Complex Analyis--hated Ahlfors' Complex Muddle,"Ahlfors may know his material but he is apparently unable to communicate it to his audience. Exercises and theory were often only vaguely related. Virtually no examples are worked anywhere in the text, which means that the gulf between theory and application was rarely crossed.The only value I see for this book is as a review for someone who is already well versed in the subject matter. For the person learning it for the first time, the text is nearly unusable. Other, more clear texts make complex analysis interesting and approachable. This text is too terse, obtuse and vague to use as a guide to complex analysis proofs and theory."
3,It could have been better.,"I know this book is a classic, but I don't believe that the approach to the subject is the best possible. First of all, the author never really defines the set of complex number (either as RxR with certain operations or as a splitting field of R[x]). The book is very compact but fails to give the reader first learning complex analysis a good impression of what is going on, having too few and too theoretical examples. I believe that it can be really useful as a reference, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is foreign to the subject."
5,A good and valuable intro to Complex Analysis,"I picked up this book as a text to my complex functions class. The topics presented in the book is the classic need-to-know materials for undergraduates (complex functions, analytic functions as mappings, complex integration, series and products, etc), plus other topics which undergraduate complex analysis course usually omits: Weirstrass theory, Picard's theorem and zeta function (from complex analysis point of view). The presentation is clear, the mathematic is well presented (but with a few gaps in the proofs), the examples are motivated and useful and the exercises are ok (some of them are pretty challenging!). The book should serve as a text very well.PS: Lars V. Ahlfors was the first recipient of the Fields Medal (in 1936, along with Jesse Douglas)."
2,Fluffy Funk.,More dance music than funk in my opinion and on that note I have heard better dance music.In short a tad disappointing.A bit too light & fluffy for my liking.
4,Really Good Granola,This is a really tasty granola with lots of good-for-you ingredients. It's filling and stays with you 'til lunch. You will enjoy it.
1,2 12-package boxes were both STALE!!!,I ordered 2 12-box cartons of this cereal because my family loves it and all the boxes in BOTH cartons were stale. We were extremely disappointed. Would not recommend ordering it from Amazon. Go to the grocery store and buy a box at a time to ensure freshness!
1,"Not granola in any way, shape, or form","I found this by searching granola cereals and it looked interesting. However, it is mostly fluff, can't hardly see the almonds, and what raisens there are are hard and stale even though the box claims they are coated in glycerin. Won't buy from this company ever again."
5,"Beautiful, Realistic Charts!","I love this book and I highly recommend it for more advanced cross stitchers. These charts realistically depict the kimono as an art form as well as luxurious attire. I find that these charts are challenging as well. This book is also particularly useful to anyone interested in Japanese art history, particularly the Edo Period. I'm currently working on one of the more intricate designs; I love to see the designs come together!"
5,Lovely Oriental Book,"I have always admired Joan Elliott's work, but I first discovered her in a cross stitch magazine that had one of the designs from this book in it. I fell in love with that design, and after seeing the advertisement for this book, had to get it.I was not dissapointed. Joan Elliott knows how to combine grace, beauty, colour and a good understanding of the culture, to create beautiful designs that you can stitch. The designs range from various sizes and levels of complexity. The book also provides ideas on how to finish and present completed works, with detailed step by step instructions.GREAT book. Get this while you can!"
4,Beautiful but use other fabric,"The designs are beautiful, but the recommended fabric is Rustico Aida by Zweigart. This fabric is very difficult to get, and not one I'd use for showcase stitching--which these could be. I would recommend stitching these on a linen evenweave."
4,The Best of Billy J. Krame and the Dakotas,"If you like Rock and Roll of the 60's, this is the one for you. There is lively songs or some some slow ones. Very good variety."
2,Wouldn't trust IM Raetsky further than I can throw him.,"Two years after describing the Sicilian Four Knights as ""...perfectly playable and not to face serious threats on its right to existence in the coming century..."" IM Alexander Raetsky demolishes his pet line in another book (Experts vs the Sicilian).Just thought this information could be of interest to potential buyers of 'Meeting 1.e4'..."
1,Extremely disappointing,I bought this book for my son who recently graduated from college but I would have been better off just handing my son the money I paid for this book. The book contains out of date advice--it might have made sense for someone graduating 20 years ago but not in this millennium. Nowadays kids need solid advice on finding a job and taking charge of their finances after they graduate. Unfortunately this book does not provide the answers 22 year olds need.
4,My son loves it!!,"My son loves this game. Although, it is the second one. The first one didn't last long. We had it about three months and the cord had a short in it. We are on our second one, we've had it one month and so far so good. My son loves it so much we had to replace it. It has really helped his hand/eye coordination."
5,Sponge Bob Rocks!,"I am a 35 year old, I have purchased this for my 9 year old daughter. We both love playing this game. We have Gamecube, PS2, and several gameboys, but they are collecting dust now that we have this Sponge Bob game. I love it because the games are ""old-school"" and are pretty much the only kind I know how to play.My daughter and I love Bubble Pop we have gotten to level 47 so far."
1,Fun toy but it sure doesn't last long!,"This was our first purchase into TV gaming. It was a relatively inexpensive way to explore the world of playing games on our TV. Our girls loved it (ages 11, 8 and 6), however after only one week (one week!) it started blacking out while playing. In response to an email, I was told to change the batteries (which I told them I had already done). However, it's still blacking out--I think the cord is bad, and this after only 1 week of play. So no, I don't think this product is worth it, although the games were fun to play. We'll save up our money and get a Game Cube or PS2 and play Spongebob games on that instead."
3,Spongebob Plug n Play,"Bought as a replacement for one our dog chewed, and my 4yo loves it. That's good enough for me!"
3,The picture looks nothing like the actual bag!,"The ACTUAL bag is black mesh, not reinforced, and really looks nothing like the picture. However, it is a very decent bag. My scuba instructor has the same one, and he owns a dive shop. I'd rec it, but don't expect the photo!"
4,Great roomy bag...that needs a shoulder strap!,"I love this BIG bag, I can fit ALL my gear in it! That being said...anyone who knows how much a bag full of scuba gear can weigh, really appriciates the enginuity that goes into incorporating a shoulder strap on ANY gear bag. I would love to give this product 5 stars, but the lack of the for mentioned strap prevents me from doing so. It's BIG, rugged, easy to clean, all around great, just as long as you don't have to carry it too far."
5,Awesome Film!,"This film shows the power of the neo-nazi movement in Germany following the second World War. It does so very well. You will enjoy this film, especially if you are educated on pre WWII German sociology and psychology (basic 20th century european history really).Disenfranchised kids are lured into the Neo-Nazi underground and the drama, action, adventure that follows is gripping. The main character is strong and his story line is wonderfully constructed. The sex and nudity is probably overdone, and the drama sometimes too strong, but the positive characteristics of the film well overcome the few negative ones.You can get this cheaper through Amazon's CreateSpace: createspace.com/219025 Code: ALLXKLKB for 10% off.Hope this helps!"
2,2 versions of backpack,"The Leap Pad is a great product and the backpack is perfect for storing and traveling with the pad, books and cartridges. Buyers should know there are two versions, one as pictured here with green straps, and another one with yellow straps. I know someone in an old review said it was too small but I think they were speaking of the one designated for 4 books and cartridges. The one with yellow straps was probably designed for double the storage capacity.Didn't really feel the stars rating was applicable to this item as technically it's not a ""fun"" nor ""educational"" item; it's a ""storage"" item."
4,A Wannabe Orginized Mom,My 5-y/o daughter was given the Leap Pad for Xmas last year. She loved the intro book so I bought her a few more. She loved them all. The Leap Pad is a great toy for long trips which we take often. I found it was hard to organize her books and and the tapes would fall out of the zip lock baggy that I put them in and get lost between the seats. I was lucky and found this back pack. The back pack is awsome! Not only does it hold up to four books and tapes there is enough room for a coloring book or two. She loves putting the back pack on and is handy when packing up to go home. You can see at a glance if everything is there. I think this product is the greatest and a must have for anyone who has more then one book for their Leap Pad!
2,Don't Be Fooled -- Leap Pad Doesn't Fit,"I can't believe such a poorly designed item is marketed by Imaginarium. I can barely manage to pack the backpack, and my 5 year old daughter certainly cannot. It only holds a maximum of 4 books and cartridges. The compartments for the cartridges are tight! Little fingers have trouble getting the cartridges in or out. And the worst thing is -- the actual Leap Pad doesn't fit! You definitely cannot put the thing in joint first. You can force it in latch first and let the joints stick out. But then it is jammed so tightly that a child cannot get it out. I sorely wish I hadn't wasted my money. We haved since replaced it with an old laptop computer case."
3,Get the LeapPad Storage System instead,"Go to Walmart.com. They have a LeapPad Storage System, which holds 12 cartridges and books, for $20. It has a handle so it's just as easy for kids to lug around. And, in my opinion, is much more attractive and practical than a backpack. A much better deal."
3,Too Small!,"I was so excited to find these back packs for my 4 year old twins' LeapPads. I thought I'd found the answer to transporting their pads and extra books. Unfortunately, the back packs are just too small! The LeapPad fits snuggly in the back pack and if more than a book or two are crammed in also, the pack doesn't close. My boys also have earphones (I would strongly suggest this additional piece of equipment! <G>). There is no room to store the earphones in the back pack. There is also no room for any additional coloring books, story books, toys etc...for when they need a break from the LeapPads. Over all, great concept but we ended up using our school back packs for toting our LeapPads and other paraphenalia!"
3,My kids like it but they don't use it.,My kids like this pack but they don't use it for the leap pad. It's designed really well for the leappad and everything fits pefectly ... but they used the leap pad so much that they ended up just keeping it out of the pack. It's great for traveling though - they fill it up with leap pad stuff and at least know where to put everything back when they are done but when at home it ends up being used for other purposes. Still useful!
1,"Good idea, but too small for the LeapPad","After lugging around books and cartridges in a Ziploc bag, I thought this bag would be the perfect answer for my daughter's LeapPad. It is a great concept, but the bag we received is just a bit too small to hold the LeapPad comfortably; the flaps barely close and my 5yo can't get the toy out on her own, the fit is so snug. It has been very frustrating to her (and all of us) that she can't manage on her own. An extra inch is all I ask!"
2,A must have for the Leap Pad,"Before I invested in this backback, we were having problems keeping up with the cartridges that come with each Leap Pad book. This solved that and made it much easier to have everything you need when it's time to hit the road. It's very durable, but not VERY padded for protection, so I wouldn't drop it. If you own more than 3 or 4 Leap Pad books, make this investment!!"
5,Storage,This back pack is perfect for keeping his different Leap Frog items in one place. My son feels as if he's a big boy wearing it.
2,Leap Pad Backpack,"My children received Leap Pads for Chirstmas this year. What a wonderful product. My 5 year old was given the Leap Pad Learning System while my 2 year old was given the Imagination Desk Learning System. They also each received a backpack to keep their things organized. Again, what a great gift, until I tried to put the Imagination Desk Learning System in the backpack. It doesn't fit!!! My 5 year old got all packed up with no problem, while my 2 year old sat there frustrated because his backpack didn't work. I cannot believe you would market an item that so blantantly just doesn't work.I love all of your products, but wish you would design a backpack to fit all of your systems. My little guy is really bummed that he doesn't have a matching ""special"" backpack for his system."
2,Great Bag!,"I gave this low stars on ""fun"" and ""educational"" because it is after all just a backpack!Today I received this bag and was anxious to see if it would fit our Leap Pad Pro we are giving our son for Christmas. It did! It has PLENTY of room. However, my backpack does not look like that one pictured. (...)The one I received in the mail has a dark blue cover and lime green sides and back with yellow straps. It looks very nice. And it is very durable.This will make a great companion to our Leap Pad Pro. Also, it has an additional strap/hook on the back so you can hang it up."
3,"Well Made Backpack, Keeps everything organized",I have purchased this product and I am very happy with its durability. Great purchase to keep all your Leap Pad stuff organized and in one place...definitely fits more than 4 books and cartidges. Worth it.
5,Absolutely satisfied...,"I bought two of these since we have a leap pad as well as My First Leappad. Both of these units work with this backpack. I like how you can fit tons of cartridges into the backpack and it keeps the bookshelves neatly organized... plus when you are looking for a book and cartridge, you know right where to find them."
4,Perfect accessory,"Just wanted to let everyone know that if your child has the leapfrog, this is a perfect addition. My son receieved the frog for x-mas, and I could not find a case anywhere. The books and tapes were everywhere, know they are all together, and he thinks it is cool to have a little backpack. Plus as an added bonus, the green and blue, are the same colors as the leapfrog, so we also coordinated."
1,No Protection for Leap Pad,"I just recently purchased a Leap Pad and was very pleased to see the Leap Pad BackPack available again. However, I'm very disappointed with it and intend on taking it back. This backpack provides no protection for the the leap pad. There is no padding whatsoever. I finally found a messenger bag with padding that will, at least, provide some protection for the Leap Pad."
3,Good accessory,My daughter lover carrying it around. I like it because she can safely carry it plus the fact that her books and tapes are stored all together.
5,Excellent buy!,My six year old has had his backpack for over a year and a half & it sill looks brand new! We have to buy another one for his little brother who just got his own LeapPad because they each play with it too often to share! We can easiliy fit 8 books and cartridges with the LeapPad in the backpack and there is still room for headphones! I highly recommend headphones for car trips! They can each do their own books and you can still have a conversation with someone else!
5,Super Storage bags for leappads,These bags are great for storing your child's leappads and books in. The best thing is they are always ready to take on the road or on the family vacation. They are easily accessible for my three and four year old. They seem to use their leappads more often. What a great creation.
4,must have,This backpack is a must have for any child and parent with a Leap Pad. It is easy to find your Leap Pad and the books and cassettes can be stored in it. I recomend this for anyone who has bought a Leap Pad or is thinking about buying one.
1,Great travel and storage for your leap pad,"A great way to tote and store your leap pad. We've added a set of headphones (ah, peace and quiet!) so we can't fit as many books in. Space for 4 cartridges, but you could always drop more in the main compartment. The straps adjust well and my 4 year old can carry it on her back with no problem."
3,EH.,"This cage broke while putting it together. The plastic is thin and brittle. I never actually put my hamster in it (because it broke), but I was afraid that if I did she would nest in this enclosed wheel just as she did in the Crittertrail X cage. The other thing that concerned me was the small amount of ventilation on this. Hamsters can get really sick from their urine odors and this just seemed like it would trap them in. I can't say that for sure though since I never used it. I am now waiting for a SAM Toob-A-Top for a regular glass aquarium. That seems to be the best compromise if your child (or you) wants the coolness of the tubes and you want the ease of cleaning and lots of space for your hamster. I think ""Chunky"" will love her Toob-A-Top."
5,"Extremely ""Stressful"".","Especially if you break a component as we did. We were ""Panic Stricken"" for Months, until we located your Amazon.com site.We purchased the kit and now continue to blissfully enjoy the very best tasting coffee and aroma ever experienced.For months we purchased numerous coffee percolators but could not get the satisfaction and taste as is with the bodum santos vacuum coffee percolator. Needs more than 5 gold stars to commend it. Magnificently beautiful coffee.Bazza FennellMaryborough,Queensland.Australia."
2,"Makes good coffee, but doesn't always work well","We bought this coffeemaker because it seemed cool in the way that it brews the coffee.Cons:1. Takes a very long time (1 hour) to heat the water using the Sterno heating unit. Even on a stovetop, it takes at least 35 minutes.2. The biggest problem is that the steam leaks around the rubber stopper. You have to press down on the top bowl to keep a good seal for the steam and water to rise to mix into the coffee grounds.Pro:The coffee was very tasty and full bodied."
4,Nice case,Fit nicelly to the device and gives a nice color to the set.The buttons must be pressed with more strengh.
4,Underated series,"Generator Gawl has all the makings of a great series. It is a perfect blend of comedy, drama, romence, action, and intrigue. Most of all though you began to care more and more about the characters involved. In Generator Gawl Vol. 3 Secrets and Lies, the viewer learns more and more about Gawl and his friends, plus there is some great forshadowing. Overall this volume got me looking forward to the fourth and finall Generator Gawl, Out of Time. My only complaint is if your an avid animation fan you need to buy the DVD because the diffenrence between the dubbed version and subtitle version is vast. Instead of changing a line here and there, the people who did the dubbed version pretty much changed all the dialogue. One can watch both the dubbed and the subtitle and feel like its totally 2 diffent movies."
3,Nice Camera... BUT NO SOFTWARE INCLUDED,"I would recommend the camera's video quality and nicely put operating controls, even thought there is an inconvenience with the camera's external light button that it would be better placed on the outside of the camera, not inside where the LCD panel closes and forcing you to open it each time you want to activate the light and some useful controls when trying to only use the ViewFinder to maximize battery use. THE very drawback on this model is the lack of any editing software and USB cables. And be advised that Panasonic doesn't offer any free software not even PC drivers for letting you use any other software to control the camera.... you must buy them and wait months to arrive because they are always ""backorder""... if you don't intend to hook it up right away with a Computer, it's a nice camcorder with many included extras other cameras have as options but no software is just a pain in the butt...."
1,Will not buy Panasonic again!!!!!!,"Come on Panasonic, you say in your advertisement that the DV Camera can be used as a Webcam and images can also be transferred through the USB port. OK, I realized that the USB cable was extra (not happy about that), but to not supply a software driver in the box or on your website. You got to be kidding!!!!!I once considered Panasonic as a premier brand but will look elsewhere for future purchases."
4,Great Cam for the price... Nice Job,"People have to remember that this is a very affordable ENTRY level cam. It does the job very well. Nice viewfinder, excellent zoom (one of the deepest at 800x) and simple features. This is a beautiful cam at a great price!!! I have not found any drawbacks on transferring or downloading either. Fun also to add zoom lenses and/or wide lenses affordably. Overall a great buy!!!!!! If you believe you are a director, you may need to look into advanced models at much higher prices. Enjoy!!!!!!!!"
4,Assistance to convert your video to computer,I know the frustration of wanting some software with this product. Yes its a nice little camera and all but if you want to get some actual video out of it to be put on your computer you could use video capturing software like snag-it which has a free download and trial. Granted the video will not be the best of quality but if you absolutely have to have this on video on your computer snag-it will give it to you but at low quality. You can also snap still images from the videos using it too. Hope this helps
2,That's About Enough,"I'm a fan of LaBute's. I loved ""In the Company of Men,"" ""Your Friends and Neighbors,"" and thought ""Fat Pig"" was pretty darn good. But this latest play seems a retread--and a dull one at that. This interracial love triangle with its unreliable narrator is too clever by half.I'm not the kind of reader who thinks we must ""like"" the characters but don't we have to find them interesting, at least? How about a rewrite, Neil. Did a little deeper and stop relying on the ""surprise"" ending to make it all work. You're becoming the M. Night Shymalan of plays, without the cool special effects."
1,Poor Quality Control,"Right out of the box, the 'carriage' lever would not lock down. It's difficult to mis-operate a toaster but I did read the instuctions and had my wife try it. No go! I don't have a very high opinion of Cuisinart's QA. I did quite a bit of research to find a top-of-the-line toaster. What a pain to have to return it; I'll look for another brand."
2,Not Worthy of Cuisinart Name,This toaster look great but it doesn't make toast worth a darn. I have to flip each piece of bread around for complete toasting because it toasts only one side at a time. Very disappointed.
3,"Great for the Praxis I, Lousy for the Praxis II","I'm trying to find a book that actually teaches you the material you'll need to know for the Praxis II (specifically test #0014), instead of just giving you a practice test and letting you know which things you should study in some other book. Unfortunately, this book is in the latter category when it comes to the Praxis II. But for the Praxis I (the PPST) it has WONDERFUL review material that actually teaches you EVERYTHING you need to know. So if you want to study for the Praxis I, this book is worth the price, but if you want to study for the Praxis II, find another book. And let me know which one you find!"
5,excellent study item,"This study guide is filled with great sample exercises and tests. By going section by section and completing the practice tests, I was able to work on my weaker skills. I ended up getting a great score on the Praxis I! Be sure to practice your essay-writing though... that can be tricky when taking the timed test."
2,Not helpful,This book by Kaplan was not helpful at all. I bought it to help me review for the middle school math test and I didn't find one thing in it worth studying.
2,Skimps on Information for Praxis II,"I used this review only for Praxis II. Accurate and well-summarized information was included in the Organizing Content Knowledge section on page 269. However, other sections are not asthorough. Specifically, a rewrite needs to be done of Teacher Professionalism on page 291. Information regarding the Lang Ordinances of 1785 and 1787 is incorrect as it indicated a separation of church and state that is not evident in the legal document itself nor in the actions of those who implemented the congressional mandates. In general, the section leaves out a great deal of information relevant to the Praxis Text for the History of American Education."
3,Distant Second,This book is a distant second to the Barrons Praxis book. Kaplan trys unsuccessfully to copy the book from Barrons but Kaplan does not give you anywhere near as much for your money as Barrons.
2,Not helpful for Praxis II,"I would not buy this book again if I knew what was in it. I was taking Praxis II and it just told me ""study this, study that"" but did not give me the information. So I think they expect you to go out and buy other books to get the information. Not helpful for Praxis II"
4,Good Preparation for the Praxis Test,"Terrific value! This book covers the whole gamut of Praxis in detail, so that the conscientious reader knows what to expect on the test."
3,Too much recaps,"Interesting story of couple, popularity-hungry Miyazawa Yukino and moody Arima Souichiro based on a popular girls' comic in Japan with the same title. The TV series reflects what some teenagers are dealing with in real life - passing an exam; establishing an image; yearning for attention; surpassing a rival in class; getting along with a stepbrother/stepsister; smoking; and premarital sex.Animation is simple and creatively executed. Soundtrack is very good. Japanese and English voice acting is done well. DVD extras, commentaries on Japanese culture and voice actors' interviews, are enjoyable. The problem with the series is the unncessary recaps. Besides the two episodes that solely contain recaps/summaries there are approximately five minute recap in almost every episode."
2,Don't waste your money...,"They should only charge 50% for this series, because only the first half is worth watching. By the time it got to end (if you can call it an end) my husband and I were scratching our heads in disbelief. It's like they just completely lost interest, but were forced to fill out the last disc anyway. The manga are wonderful, so I really expected better than this..."
2,Read the Manga Instead.,"The first part of this series is very good but in the middle of the third disk, which is halfway through, it becomes pretty bad. The fourth disk on is trash. One of the episodes goes from beautiful anime art to cut out scraps of paper on a stick, literally. The episodes go back to normal with mediocre story lines until the final episode that is half animated and half story board. I'm going to guess budget problems..."
4,Great series but..,"Personally,I LOOOOOVE ""His and Hers.."" but I noticed,that around the 3rd DVD,the show itself went a little downhill. The plot was a bit slow from time to time and for some reason,the animation was a little...bizarre. Its as if the creators were on a low budget. O_O But the 1st two DVDs are the BEST! Its both funny and adorable.Still, I say, buy this product. This is a good series. Just be warned of the weird animation later on..."
3,They stopped caring about production halfway through.,"I got His & Her Circumstances b/c of all the raving reviews. I really liked it up to the halfway point. The characters are good and so is the story. However, halfway through something happened, wasted time and a whole lot of nothing. This anime has incredible potential but falls way short. It's like a race car blowing a tire on the last lap of a race just b4 winning. I really want to love this series but it ends really lousily. Any more than 3 stars is misleading. Suzuka is kinda similar but done right all the way through. Watch it instead."
5,A Great Series,"I absolutely love this anime. It's a classroom/high-school drama mainly about a boy and girl falling in/out of love with each other and the obstacles in their path (emotional problems or another girl to compete with, for instance) which prevent them from being together indefinitely. It's actually quite comedic at times. H&HC; really has a ""manga"" style going for it... think Azumanga Daioh, but not as over the top in the comedy.One of the things I really like about this series is the musical score. It has some great tracks ranging from many styles of music and they fit the mood well.The box set is also a great value as opposed to buying each of the DVDs individually. I highly recommended this."
4,Cute,"I'm usually more into... Fighting robots, crude humor, etc. when it comes to anime... but this was a good story! I got it for my girlfriend, who had received a 2 or 3 episode sampler when she was younger (13 maybe?). Now, 20, she was extremely happy to have gotten to see the rest of this because she really did like it!Also, great price!"
2,Not for Idiots...,"I found this book to be lacking in many areas. Even though it has the Idiots Guide label on it, I did find it very confusing at times. I am an Aerospace Engineer (which doesn't mean I'm not an idiot, but lends credibility to me, I hope) and I was frustrated by many parts of this book. Many terms are used without explanation. Terms such as ""securities"", ""dividends"", and ""liability"". I have a general idea of what these terms mean, but the book gave no explanation what so ever before using them. Also, the risk assessment quiz was very poorly worded and difficult to understand.Overall, I would not recommend this book. I hear the Investing for Dummies book is better, but I haven't gotten a chance to read that one yet."
4,Complete Guide to Investing,"I purchased this book in preparation for a long flight cross country. The book was written in an easy to understand style and I found the content to be exactly what I was looking for. I was disappointed in the many grammatical errors and the botched calculation on page 18 made me question the editor's credibility, but overall I would recommend this book to someone seeking a basis in investing."
4,freedom from the known,"I have purchased this book at least 7 times during the last 20 yrs; everytime, I gave it away to a friend who was going through a difficult time. This book does not give you any specific answers to any specific problem, but it helps you to gain an understanding of the human emotions, and make you realize that the only person you can control is yourself. It also helps you deal with other people, by understanding their particular nature, thus finding a particular way to communicate more positively."
5,"The ""definitive"" work","This is my fav of J's writings. Naught more to be said. Be there, or B square."
5,My Official Favorite Book,"It has been a long time since I have read a work of fiction that was filled with intellect, wit, and reality. I usually read for just an hour per day; however, with Mr. Channer's book, I found myself sitting down and becoming engrossed with Fire and Sylvia's lives for hours. Because of the book's content and painful honesty, I have made ""Waiting in Vain"" my favorite book. Yes, Mr. Channer's story line and writing skills impressed me that much. Amazingly, I've had the book in my possession since September of last year when I first bought it, but I did not get a chance to read it until now. I kick myself for not reading it earlier because, even though it was fictional, it made me look at relationships differently. What really moved me was Fire's proclamation of infatuation (p. 249 in paperback). It was beautiful. Honestly, I did not know know that men actually thought on those terms. To sum it up, Mr. Channer's book was a breath of fresh air, and I thank him for writing it."
3,Okay but....,"After reading the reviews and hearing about all the praises, I decided to run out and buy the book. No doubt Colin Channer indeed is a very talented writer, but the book seemed to drag in several chapters. I kept waiting for the climax and can't remember if there ever was one. Channer is truly a literary genius, but overall the book was a little slow."
2,Waiting in vain for the book to end.,"My book club and I read the book and decided that it was too wordy. You can tell that the book was written by a man, because we don't know any woman that would say some of the things these woman said in this book. Also, we have read other books containing more than one storyline and found these to be too disconnected. Although, they all knew one another (biblically or literally), they did not interconnect with the theme of the story. On a more positive note, we did feel weak when he showed up at her doorstep at just the right moment, when she needed him most."
5,Very informative about Jamaican culture,"It is a great book. The characters are people that you can relate to on a day to day basis. As a musician I must say that the character I-nelik reminded me of a cross between my friends Chinna Smith and Glen Browne, who I played with in Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. The depiction of Jamaica and Jamaican people was real, in contrast to the way they are usually portrayed in books and movies. Reading this book is an ideal introduction to Jamaican culture and Jamaican people"
5,"Splendid, Great and Captivating!!!","I have recently finished reading "" Wating in Vain"" which I had purchased for two reasons. One being Colin Channer's origin (Jamacian) like myself and wanted to support him and because E. Lynn Harris highly recommended it. I LOVED IT!!!The patios were beautifully written. I found myself laughing through them, for I have heard most of the same saying growing up.Sylvia's relationship with Fire captured me and I was mersmerized by their chemistry and its intensity. For a while I found myself wishing I were Sylvia, so therefore, I became Syliva while reading it.I too, will be ""Waiting in Vain"" for your next novel.You have done a splendid job Mr. Channer. Big up!!!"
5,SENSATIONAL !!!!,"Waiting in Vain is the most wonderful book. Eloquently written. Never before have I read a book and at the completion of reading the book felt so satisfied. There is so much in the book to read about, and learn, and love. Mr. Channer has such a brilliant mind, and he is truly a talented and gifted writer. I look forward to reading more of his work."
4,"Poetic and lyrical, it will change the way you think.","Waiting in Vain is a beautiful, poetic, lyrical, and descriptive book, that allows you to become more comfortable with the many different sides of yourself. The book is written in such a way that helps you to release, dream, explore, contemplate, and relax. It is an awesome tribute to love and friendship."
5,Wher Does One FIND a Man Like Fire?,"The book club ladies and I want to know!This jamaican blood's got IT! I can just imagine the author, Colin Channer does too in abundance. May I say that the ladies and I, 'ate it up'? Sincerely."
5,I want a 'Fire',"Every woman needs a man like 'Fire.' He's so real. He helped Sylvia find herself insuch unique ways. Channer's style is unique, quite different from most fiction writers. He makes you think instead of telling some things. A great writer."
5,"I loved this book, read it twice!!","Finally a book about a man, that can be strong in his own beliefs, yet sensitive to others around him. No male bashing here. Nicely written,it will take you to a culture that can be a whole new world for some. Fire had moral integrity and great passion. A must read!!"
5,TOTAL RAPTURE!,"Colin Channer takes you from the streets of Brooklyn to the shore of Jamaica in this beautifully written story that leaves you yearning for more! The love scenes are tantilizing and sensuous from beginning to end! Every character came to life in my mind - vivid faces, and voices. I read the book in two days. Are there any Fire's out there? I demand another book! I was disappointed with the last page...... because there were no more pages!"
5,Waiting In Vain has raised the standard.,"It is hard to believe that this is Colin's first novel. I am also in the process of writing my first novel. Colin has raised the bar for me. His utilization of language and details are expressive and expansive. This is truly a book of hope. I saw a lot of myself in both Sylvia and Fire (the main characters). Colin has demonstrated an intense perception of passion, love and hate. I usually pride myself for reading fast, but I purposely took my time with each page to enjoy the flavor of this story. A book I would buy for a good friend; male and female."
5,Beautifuly written....,Colin's way with words is absolutely brilliant. His character depictions are so relateable (if there's such a word) and honest. Women will enjoy this book because of its beauty and truth; men should read this book because it comes wonderfully close to unravelling some of the myths about what women REALLY want. A definite must read!
5,"Every woman needs a ""Fire"" in her life. Thank you Colin",This is a wonderful book that expresses the importance of following your heart. Its so nice to read a black love story. Peace and blessings.
4,It really took me someplace total enjoyment,This book was awesome and great. I truly enjoyed each and every individual character. This book was very well written and I can't wait to read the next one by this awesome author.
5,Beautiful,"I first read this book in the summer of 2000. I was so much in Love with ""Fire"". Eventhough I have read hundreds of books since them, I still come back to this one. I just finished reading it for the third time and it is even better. Channer really has a ""love affair with words' that is hard to describe. He captured you from the opening line and never let you go.I eagerly wait for the next book."
5,Poetic Reading...,"This story was cultural, diverse and very enlightening. From the dialect to the island hopping scenic shores, this story had it all. Including a woman who wants everything and a man who wants the woman who wants everything. From museums to sex, and jilted lovers to suicide, this is a classic. The underlying plot exploring social class was eye opening, making this a must have on your bookshelf for those who want something that is not the overdone norm........"
5,Phenomenally Touching and Realistic,"Colin Channer deserves special recognition for this masterpiece. The characters come to life and inspire us in ways that are unexplainable. The characters become symbolic and give us hope to believe in Love. All praise is due to Mr. Channer, his book should be made into a movie. I will always follow his work, he is indeed a master. Respect to Mr. Channer."
5,TITILLATING,"If you're thirsty, juice drips off of every page of Colin Channer's Waiting in Vain. He scoops up words like God scoops up clay and breathes life into his characters. The storyline paints a colored and textured picture of real life experiences of love, sex, jealousy, failures and success. I especially appreciate the exposing of a man's vulnerabilities, a treasure that men strive to keep buried. This story delivers a man's soul unmasked and naked. Truely this novel has furbished the tarnished corners of my mind. If your mind can go deep, I invite you to dive into Waiting in Vain, head first!"
5,This book was as delicious as a piece of rich chocolate!,"Wow! I loved this book. I saw it in a bookstore I frequent, and since I had just come back from vacationing in Jamaica, the story caught my eye. I really appreciated how Colin was able to include all the elements that make love in the nineties between 30 something Black professionals so complicated. There are no cardboard characters here, or easily pegged good or bad guys. The two main characters have their sympathetic and annoying traits. I live in West Africa, and am always looking for books with an international flair. Also let's also not forget the senuality that was so well captured. Great work Colin. Can't wait to read the next one!"
4,A Vivid Visit to the Non-tourist Caribbean,"I bought this book because I had read newspaper reviews of it and because I'm Jamaican so, naturally, I am excited by Jamaican authors.Well, it was everything I wanted in fiction and then some... The author manages to take you vividly to Bohemian New York and tropical living at its best.A realistic look at the love journey and a very real rendition of life in Jamaica and the Jamaican hang ups without any form of underlying cynicism. A great read!"
5,A wonderful summer read,"Waiting in Vain is a wonderfully lyrical, passionate read. Channer's beautiful writing style makes all of the characters come alive. For once an author of color has written about a black male hero who is able to exhibit sensitivity, passion, intelligence, and love. His descriptions of Jamaica, Brooklyn, and England are so poetic and real that you feel you are right there with each of the characters. I could easily hear the voice of each of the characters and by the end of the book I felt like I knew them well. This is a love story, but it is not just a story of romantic love. It is about how love is a basic in every part of our lives. Men, as well as women will find this book enjoyable because as you read you will feel good. You can hear Channer's sense of humor as well as his passion for his craft throughout each page."
5,"A superbly written,incredibly sensuous reading experience.","Waiting In Vain by Colin Channer makes an awesome and welcome entry into the new unchartered landscape of true romance. His poetic nature of storytelling brings vivid images to both the mind and spirit. The Caribbean-born author and characters speak to an aspect of our culture that is typically not heard. Caribbean-Americans are usually lumped into the greater African-American experience when in actuality we bring an entirely different flavor and dynamic to it. This novel has given our culture a resounding voice. I was captured by the intensity of Sylvia and Fire's relationship, so much so that I could not put this book down until it was finished. The storyline is complex and engaging in it's simple message of love. Love gave life to their desperate search to find happiness within themselves and each other. This novel was a journey to self-discovery and a find that was definitely worth waiting for."
5,A Classic Story,"From the first page, I was drawn into the wonderful story of Fire and Sylvia and their rocky path to each other. Though many obstacles were placed in their path, their fate was each other and in the end fate prevailed. I recommend this lush, powerful read to anyone who wants their faith in true love and destiny renewed. From the hustle and bustle of New York's art world to the lush Jamaican countryside, the book will hold you spellbound as you are drawn into the world of two souls in a struggle to find each other. This book is a life changer..."
4,No longer Waiting,"I immensely enjoyed Colin Channer's book. There was so much sensivity in the book I still find it hard to believe that he is indeed a man. I have read books by men about love, and was very disappointed. The books that I read by otherr men about love just did not touch my heart. Colin speaks to the heart girls, so read this one. I fell in love with the lead character--A BLACK MAN!"
3,Difficult to read if you do not know the language.,"Overall, I thought the book was worth reading. My difficulty was not being from an island or familiar with the language of Fire's home, it was very hard to comprehend the meaning of a lot of the terms used in the book. I think this might be a book that you would have to read twice to fully understand it."
1,I didn't like this one,"I'm an avid reader. And this book, I really didn't enjoy. I actually didn't finish it. I just couldn't get into it. I bought it cause I read the reviews that were in here, and I totally disagree with everyone that gave it five stars."
4,Not Just Another Read,"As someone who left Jamaica twenty years ago this book brought back memories as only another J'can could. His words, his thougths and feelings allowed us all (J'cans and non-J'cans) to experience the feelings of what it's like to be raised amongst the upper-class and his rebellion about his times spent in the ghetto & appreciating that way of life & his association w/his Rastafarian uncle.The characters & plot of Waiting in Vain have shown us how our background and uprbringing have a pro/con effect in the outcome of our daily needs, wants & desires.Waiting In Vain is a definite must read and must have for always. This will be a reference novel for my friends who have often asked about growing up in Jamaica."
4,Thrillingly IN-DEPTH and THOUGHT-PROVOKING reading,"After reading through only the fifth chapter of this book, I was compelled to e-mail the author and share with him, my excitement and appreciation for such good writing. Colin Channer coupled skillful writing with something meaningful and real to share with his readers about the joys and pains of human relationships. He then layered that with sociological and socioeconomic issues that do not stop in America, but span all across the globe. I am one who enjoys reading to expand my mind and reading ""Waiting In Vain"" provided me a great opportunity to do so."
3,A stale read.,"Waiting in Vain was disappointing because of the many cliches and predictable scenes. Sylvia was the most pathetic, helpless woman I've read about in a long time. Is that how men view women, as helpless, overly emotional creatures needing a savior? Also, is man's definition of romance always centered around sex? How about stimulating conversation about real issues. However, I did appreciate Fire's observation of class distinctions and his recognition that privilege can afford one a carefree approach to self-actualization. I can also appreciate Channer's use of Patois in the story, but it does not compare to the innovative approach of Zora Neale Hurston."
4,"Excellent read, horrible cover!","The book was well written, great humor and very relatable for anyone who has ever been in love or would like to be. The only thing is that the cover does not give the book any justice. At first glance you would think its one of those trashy romance novels, however its about more than romance, its about true love and the romance behind it."
5,"Dream a little Dream, Fire is real","I thought this book was awesome, to say the least. Colin really pulled you into the novel with his various character roles. You didn't have to try hard get involved, it was harder to separate. I haven't read a book this fascinating in years. The places are so real (being born in Jamaica, visited NY and now living in Canada), that I was able relate with no problem as to what was going on during certain scenes. Brothers, there is nothing in wrong in being what you can be. Forget about the stereotypes and Let Love!!!"
4,supporter of black books,"This is a must read for all those struggling with love, struggling out of love, and struggling to find love. I've been to the Caribbean, to London, and to Brooklyn, and Colin Channer makes those places come alive all over again. The book was great, and I've recommended it to everyone I know- as I eagerly awaiting his next book."
4,Required reading,Got this as required reading for my WHNP/CNM program. Came fast and in great condition. Thumbed through it and like it.
2,"Unfortunately, becoming more of the same","The first issue of Concho River Review I purchased (at Brazos Bookstore, Houston) was a mixture between the same old ""avantgarde, creative"" stuff and a few insightful pieces. The latest issue, Volume XX, is a total disaster: it's entirely the kind of machine-stamped, workshop-generated, topicless, ""unique"" in setting but mindless in execution, trendy garbage. There is nothing of literary value here although the poem ""Lapse"" is amusing. I hope Concho River Review gets off the MFA trip it is on and resumes printing material that is actually critical of the assumptions we make, conveys learning instead of emotional sure bets, and has something at all to say, because right now this is a wasteland of zero value."
4,Fantastic all-round holster.,"The Galco Yaqui is the simplest holster available and will fit almost any pistol or revolver you have. It is incredibly comfortable as it is so small, yet can hold weapons up to full-size 1911's. Galco gunleather is top quality and is famous for their high-end products. If you want a decent and concealable belt holster then this would be a great choice. If only they made one which would accept weapons with rail mounted accessories..."
5,love it!,I am in love with my food processor. It works great and has made my cooking time in half. I also knead my dough in it and yes its placed on my counter cause the colour red looks absolutely gorgeous.
5,My wife loves it,"this was actually a surplus unit from QVC. It came with all the attachments. It is awesome my wife makes bread, chops nuts, makes pie crust etc"
4,Confirmed with KitchenAid,"I emailed KitchenAid and they confirmed this model was made specifically for QVC, but is still a ""real"" KitchenAid.Note that this model KFPW760* also qualifies for the 3 butting boards rebate offer currently on."
4,Very good product,I bought this after my husband bought me another brand that was just awful...I couldnt even use it to do a good job on chopping up vegatables.So far this machine has been a blessing in the way it whips through griding up nuts. I love to make fermented vegatables and bought it to help me in chopping and grating. It truly whips though those tough tasks with ease!My only down fall is that it doesnt get the nuts ground as fine as I would like. I use nut flours and would love to have the texture of store bought grindng but I guess I need another kitchen helper to get that! Other then the nuts not grinding up fine enough I love my food processor. Next one needs to be bigger! Oh and its very quite also!I also love the fact that I can get this product to match my mixer by KitchenAid. Amazon had the best price after looking into this very long.
4,The coflict between love and surperstition!!,"This love story of a girl who became a lover of an old bill collecter and fall in love with a medical student is a sign of japanese mentality in the drastic changing situation between the periode ""Edo"" and periode ""Meiji"". As his first novel ""Dancer""in wich he told his uncompleated love in Germany(at that time,having a foreign wife was a taboo), Mori tried to show the example of a conflict of natural feeling of love and the traditional superstition.Why the girl could not acheave her love? In Japan they said that a real love is a love forbidden, but it is sure that what Mori wanted to say in this book is not that beauty."
5,My baby LOVES this!,I got this when my baby was 5 months old. She never gets sick of it. It is well made for the money and keeps her attention. At 7.5 months she gets a kick out of running around it and still plays with everything on the table. I would recommend this to anyone. I got it for something different besides her excersaucer.
5,You can't go wrong with this one!,"I bought this for my 7 month old granddaughter for Christmas.She loves it!Yes it does take some time to put together,but it is well worth the wait.I was worried about how sturdy it would be as far as tipping over but no problem there.She is building strenght in her legs as she has to move around to get to what she wants to play with.THE PICTURE DOES IT NO JUSTICE!It has a nice size snack tray.Once we put her in it shes good to go for along time.We had one that was just stationary but she lost interest fast.You really can't go wrong with this.Highly recommended!"
3,"great design, terrible painting","The design of this toy is great. My baby loves it very much and she can stay in it and play with herself for more than 20 minutes. A life saver!But the painting of the standing toys on top of the table is really below the standard quality. To avoiding the potential harm to baby, I take them off."
4,Good Toy,I bought this toy for my 6 month old baby boy and he loves it! The toys on the table are easy for him to use and my 4 year old even likes playing with the table. Great Buy
5,Great Product,"I bought this for my 1 year old grandson, He just loves the piano part of the table and getting the little dolfin spinning is right up his alley... He walks around on the out side he's not wild about being confined in the seat... He is enjoying it very much. It's great for entertaining him for hours.K.Jacobs Ohio"
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!,"I bought this about a month ago for my 7 month old & he absolutely loves it. He's teething so he really likes ""chewing"" on the toys. The music really gets him going. He jumps, smiles and pats his hands everytime he hears it even when he's not in the Around We Go. My 3 yr old likes it just as much as her little brother. The music & animal voices are her favorite. I HIGHLY recommend this product. It allows me a free hand & a safe fun spot for the baby while I'm cooking & doing chores."
4,Our son loves it!,Our son loves this thing. He is 7 months old and has been using it for the past 3 months.
2,Not great,"I almost bought this and I'm glad I didn't. I tried it on my almost-5 month old, who is big for his age. It looks great, but what you can't tell from the picture is that the toys and table are a far reach from the seat. My son couldn't even get close to reaching the toys and just got frustrated. We ended up with a different entertainer/walker. It's too bad because I love the idea."
1,Toy are PAINTED! Not good esp if baby has teeth,"At first my twin daughters enjoyed this enter esp. walking around part. One day I discovered my girls had scraped some paint off the toys with their teeth. I didn't know the toys were even painted until then or I would not have allowed this toy in my home at all! Thought it was colore dplastic integrated into the toy like many other activity centers. I don't care if the paint is ""safe"" - who wants their tiny baby to ingest paint and why would a baby toy be painted. BOO hiss to Bright starts for this terrible design, like we parents don't have enough worries in raising babies in a safe environment."
4,It's a great addition,I wanted to buy a walker but was concerned about their safety. I saw this product as being the next best thing. My daughter is safely able to walk around minus the danger. From the first time I put her in it it held her attention. She especially loves the piano which plays a variety of music. I am impressed that the variety of toys should please infants at varying stages. I also like the fact that you can detach the seat from the table to provide amusement for a toddler. This was definitely money well spent. I think we will be able to get use out of this toy for a few years.
2,not what i expected,it was very easy to put together but my 7 month old isnt very entertained by the table he wants to get out of it after less than 5 monutes and I only had this toy for a week. If you have carpet I wouldnt recommend it its hard for it to rotate. I only give it 2 stars because it was simple to put together but as far as the toys on the table to entertain a child they could of been better.
5,Worked with my baby!! LOVED IT!!,We got this product for our baby when she was 6 months old. She would sit in it until she got around a year. We took the seat off and even though she is still only at the cruising stage she is now pulling up on it to play with it.When she did sit in it before she would run around in circles and she just loved it. I would absolutely recomend this to EVERYONE.The problem that I had with other 'walk around' products was that it seemed that the activities were on the thing that they walked around in. What fun is that?With this one they HAVE to walk around to get to all of the stations so it is great!!
3,Not sure about the way feet should touch ground....,"I like the concept of the item however the feet of baby should be tip-toe-ing? Feet cannot be flat on the ground when walking?If there exists only a small time period in which the feed touch the ground at the optimal level per instructions, then the item is only good for about a week in a baby's life given how rapidly a baby grows."
3,Great concept ...bad execution,I have twins and they love it. My problem is that this item has been painted and it comes off. My girls have put quite a few of the items on the table in their mouths and r of course biting them causing the paint to come off.... Why would you paint a baby toy??????????
1,Do not waste your money on this,"The toys and the top are great and fun enough for our 5 month old, but the construction of this toy is terrible. The base is hollow, light and thin, constucted of 2 seperate pieces that you use 2 screws to hold together, which makes me think that he will either push himself and the whole thingover, or he will soon be dragging it around the house. So my point for this toy not being worth 10 dollars let alone $75. The selling point of this toy is that your child is supposed to be able to move freely from station to station 360 degrees and play with the multiple toys on top. The problem is where the swivel attatches to the base. Being that the base is made of two pieces of plastic, when your child trys to rotate around the base, he gets hung up on the seams where the 2 pieces of the base are screwed together, leaving him stuck and immobile, making the toy no better than a Bumbo with a tray."
3,Around the World,Good product but when the baby walks around she takes the whole middle unit with her. The middle unit does not stay in place and I have to put something on the bottom of it so it doesn't skid around.
4,Best of a very small lot.,"Nice travelogue, with emphasis on Lithuania, but still covering the aspects of the Baltic nations in which tourists would likely be interested.As a travelogue, it's well written, nicely produced; graphic quality is high. But of course--as a travelogue--it inevitably reveals little of how ordinary people live.It's a good start, however, for anyone considering a trip to the Baltics.What this region needs now is a travelogue for each of the three nations (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania) individually. There are certainly enough differences between the nations and people to warrant such, and there's enough to see and do in each country that could fill a video of its own."
2,Dated,"This video is out of date. A lot has happened in the Baltics since this was made right after the fall of the Soviet Union.Unfortunately, I am not aware of any good contemporary travel videos covering the Baltic states in general. There is an excellent film on the city of Vilnius available from Vilnius on Video, but a good general survey is, alas, waiting to be done."
5,A Rare Passion,"Feynman is one of those rare people who are not only extraordinarily intelligent, but equally as passionate, humorous, and down-to-earth.I bought this CD set because I am a fan of physics - but now I'm also a fan of Feynman.These are his insights in his own voice - so buy a copy, and join the classroom full of people who enjoy a brilliant and vibrant man describing the secrets of the universe!"

4,Good source of Information,I purchased this book to go along with an online Hospitality and Restaurant Operations Management course. The book was a great source of information for the course.
5,A very thorough analysis!,"This book covers a wide array of business concerns pertaining to F&B operations. Focuses on not just the technical/planning aspects of operations, but also look into the dynamics of work force management and human issues. Highly recommended for the F&B entrepreneurs."
3,A little dissapointed,"I was disappointed in that the product was sold as having a cd That was to come with this product, however no cd was included. Even though I requested a follow up from amazon, nothing happened, so I feel ripped off"
2,big on professionals - short on practicals,"Not much about food and food quality, like organically grown, or GMOs. Too much ""head,"" not enough ""heart."" Too much professional financial fluff and not enough nuts-and-bolts ""how to"" information. i.e.: There was nothing about how to painlessly computerize tips for pay statements; There was nothing about how to install refrigeration equipment components for quieter running and efficiency. - returned book.Great book though, if all you want to do is open another turnkey ""dog food"" franchise with the blessings of your local Chamber of Commerce fascistos (I wouldn't let my dog eat a McDonalds because I love him) then this book is your baby.If you need new ideas and problem solver for a class act restaurant whose food won't give you cancer or some other creeping crud, then this trans-fat manual would be better suited for booster seat of a child's chair for your restaurant.It's probably a good reference book for information you can find almost anywhere."
5,A must-have,"Doug Brown's Handbook is a must-have for all restaurant managers and prospective owners. I wish I'd had this when I first started out, but you can be sure it will be required reading for all my managers!Ordering directly from his Atlantic Publishing Group is the way to go - it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.Thanks, Doug."
4,A worthwhile book.,"This is a good book. And like all Schmuhl books, it is an easy read with memorable one liners that put situations in proper perspective. A worthwhile topic, to be sure. Schmuhl is an engaging personality in his own right -- I took his ""American Political Life"" course at the University of Notre Dame. One of my favorite classes and one of my favorite professors. I think his best work however is ""The Age of Personality."""
3,"Run, Mike Brady! Run!","Robert ""Mr. Brady"" Reed and three of his friends decide to go ashore on an uncharted island after their pleasure boat's skipper gets drunk and passes out. Once there, they are greeted by an eccentric hunter (Wilton Graff) who takes them to his jungle mansion. Our four heroes are unaware of their host's evil intentions! It seems that he was a sniper in the army who lost his mind. Now, he enjoys hunting human prey, killing them, stripping off their skins in an acid bath, and making life-sized trophies for his cavernous dungeon. Robert Reed and company must find a way to stay alive against this madman and his cronies. A re-make of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, BL is no classic, but it's not all that bad either. Worth watching just to see Mike Brady running through the jungle! ..."
4,this is not a review,"I would really love to get in contact either with mr lorenzini or with the designer of the book,sean slade! my dear teresa, I would like you to notice that when mr lorenzini and mr slade (the designer) wrote this book they were both living in trieste-italy and they were teaching at the international school, school I frequented. this is why it is very difficult that they ever knew you since, when mr lorenzini went to live in valencia, the book was already getting pubblished. anyway i think i should read the book again since eleven years have passed since i last read it!"
4,It's Skincare Heaven!,"The Japanese are world renowned for their fantastic near perfect skin! But it's still surprising to have a product deliver exactly what it offers. Each pack is recommended to be used 3 times, but I got 5 uses out of some.Just applying some of this powder to my skin and massaging it in then rinsing has left me with a great skin tone and a lot less blemishes for the month or less I've been using it. Buy this! As someone who's tried a lot of products, take my word and buy this! I'm guessing the rice powder this cleanser consists of is magic in a pack.One bad thing is that if you wet the actual package the powder is in you'll get screwed. My only complaint is the kind of annoying packaging, however it does come in useful when traveling.You could just open all the cleanser packaging (30) and put them in a class, tall, tube, similar to a salt and pepper shaker and then use that instead."
4,luxurious feel but too drying for everyday use IMHO,The first time I used this powder my face felt so silky. However after a few 1X daily uses it was drying my skin too much. So now I have to relegate it to weekend only use.I wish they would put the powder in some sort of dispenser because the packet getswet in the shower and it's a little awkward to save. I will bring this alongfor vacations (instead of bulkier Noxema) and also use it after heavy perspiration (running).
4,"strong, well made fins","After reading some divers' recommendations that split fins work well at the surface, I decided to give these a try. The blades are relatively short and stiff, and, even though the performance was very responsive, I can't say that the effect of the split fins was noticeable. Perhaps the somewhat meandering style of float tube finning doesn't put these to the test, but regardless, the fins work well.The footbox is easily adjustable and works with stockingfoot/bootie combos and would be fine with most modern styles of wading boots. No way would I try to jam my old Danner leather beasts in there, but my Orvis cheapies work fine. The integrated tether system is convenient.Overall, these fins are well made, comfy, and strong. They seem to be favorable to others in their price class, and I'd buy them again."
1,Amazon sent wrong fins,"I was looking forward to trying these fins, but unfortunately either Amazaon sent the wrong fins, or their product page was misleading. They advertized these as ""split fins"", but what I received was certainly not. The underside of the finds I received said ""U.S. Divers SAR"", if that means anything useful.Couldn't exchange them, due to some policy of Amazon... hoping for a refund, anyway.Very disappointing.Tom"
3,XYZ should've made it big!!!!,"XYZ delivers a classic metal ballad on this album with ""When I Find Love"" The harmonies, drums, and great guitar chops along with some brillant lyrics make this song a true metal classic in my opinion. I believe this song was very overlooked by radio and MTV at the time of the album's release; as XYZ comes along at the end of the 80s metal era just a bit too late to put them over the top.This is an import disc, and I believe it was remastered by the import company. And I must say, they did a great job with the sound on this disc."
3,My Outlaw by Linda Lael Miller,Not one of my favorites for Linda Lael Miller - I read a lot of books and this one didn't hold my interest
5,The Power of Love,"I love time travel and I loved this book. The added touch of the mirror just made this story more interesting. To see someone you can't touch from a child a fall in love with them through the growing years. Keighly and Darby had a timeless love.Finding and losing each other over the years. The surprises and twist in this story kept me turning the pages on my kindle until well after midnight. I just couldn't put it down wanting to know what happened next. Great writing, great read. A must read if you like time travel romance!"
5,A great book,"The book was in really good shape, and if you like going back in time by 100 years it will make for wonderful reading,because of time changing its considered a paranormal book and i read the 307 pages in 2 days. Its a great book, Linda Lael Miller writes really good stories. I got this book through amazon for only a penny one of my many books i got through there."
1,One star is the lowest rating available.,"This must not be one of Linda Lael Miller's best books. Keighly flipped back and forth through time so many times, and from so many different places, that permanancy in any time or place became unbelievable. For both her and Darcy. Also, when Darcy was shot and fell through the mirror into the 20th century, and Julian called 911, he was told by the dispatcher that Redemption didn't have an ambulance. But later when Keighly and Francine were returning there from LA Francine said what a great paramedic team Redemption had.Huh? And what kind of twit would go back in time, knowing her son was suppose to die from strep throat, (Scarlet fever is strep throat with a rash)and not bring back a supply of penicillin that she could easily get from her pediatrician friend? Not a believable story."
1,Two days I'll never get back,"As a great fan of time travel romance, I was extremely disappointed with this book. Just like all of her time travel books, this one features poorly developed characters and a plotline with loose ends dangling all over the place. I shudder to think that I actually wasted 2 days reading this book while I could have reading other books that are much better."
5,My Outlaw,I've don't have realy any other details to say about ordering any books through Amazon I recommend oerdering through them everytime someone I know who is haveing troble locateing a specific book and Amozon has always come through.
4,interesting period in European diplomacy,"This interesting volume traces diplomatic developments as the Romanian principalities seek to avoid domination by both the Ottoman and Russian empires. The Romanian involvement in the ""revolutions"" of 1821 and 1848 is described, as are Russia's increasingly heavy-handed attempts to use its hegemony to block economic competition from the Romanian port of Galati. (The time period is a little early, but this volume and a companion volume by Paul Michelson are especially fascinating when read in contrast to the treatment of the ""Eastern Question"" in Dostoevsky's ""Writer's Diary."") The importance of the period is highlighted by the seeds sown for the Crimean War, especially regarding the growing distrust between Britain and Russia."
1,Not up to the original,The original battery held a charge for almost a week. This supplier is claimining that holding it for 1 day is average for the battery and phone. Not so. I hope they will respond to my concern with a better response than that!
4,almost right,"So far, the battery seems to hold its charge and is available when I need it. The only problem is that it fits pretty tight and I've had trouble getting it back out of the camera (I remove the SD memory card to allow a little extra room for grasping it but it's still difficult). For the price, I'm happy."
5,Good stuff - good cd,It should be noted that Sony BMG recalled all cd's with protective soft ware and set up an exchange program in 2006 for any consumer owned cd could be sent in for a replacement. So if you are buying this new from Amazon you should be safe but if you are buying used or from another person you may still get the spyware.
5,Awesome,"I am impressed, though I don't know why I would not be. A long time fan of both Lynyrd Skynyrd & .38 Special, it should be expected that anything the brothers Van Zant do is well worth while."
3,Very small & flexible (amost too small),"I found that this product delivered exactly what they promised. It was even smaller than the photos depicted it. The pivot pin allows the phone to ""float"" or not sit in a rigid, fixed position on your hip.However, I am a fairly big guy, and had problems getting the unit to release from the belt clip. And when your phone is ringing, that is very frustrating. I found it easier to remove the entire assembly from my belt and reattach it later.I eventually quit using the product, and found a replacement that releases the phone more easily."
1,Adhesive sucks,"The clip is an excellent system and idea. I don't know what idiot at Rivet thought to attach the clip to phones with adhesive. After having my phone drop several times due to the adhesive giving out, and one time breaking a $400+ dollar iphone - I was PISSED OFF. I still have my rivet clip, and I would very much like to use it, but these idiots don't want to make a case with the ""pin"" part built into the case, so the clip is useless. It's almost laughable to have such a sturdy metal clip attach to your phone with adhesive. It seriously makes me sick. Anyone know a WELDER? The only way I'd EVER use this clip is if the pin were WELDED to a metal case. (or better yet, simply manufactured to be a PART of it!)"
3,Promising pop from Robert Pollard discoveries,"First of all, these guys ROCK live. I saw them open for Guided by Voices. So, because they rocked so hard, I bought this album. The album doesn't exactly rock as hard as the live show, but it's still very good. Some songs aren't as good as others, but the greats are SO good--""We've Finally Found Me,"" ""I Died in 1972,"" ""I'm Pop,"" and ""Painted Grape"" are phenomenal songs. The singer has a very nasally voice, but also a lot of power. The drums on this album are rockin' as well. These guys (there's only two guys on the album, but they've expanded the line-up since then) have a lot of potential, I can't wait until they create their pop masterpiece."
5,The most philosophically enlightening work of the 21st century,"This is a truly excellent work......makes the perfect pocket guide to thwarting any over religious zealots who may come your way. A refreshing, easy read that does not offend the religious senses...but rather challenges them while opening up portals of new philosophic thought. Any question concerning religion or a higher power one may have, this book will break it down using logical syllogism and return a quite inarguable answer. You have to read it to believe it. I loved it!!"
3,"Well Written book with iffy subject matter, worth a read however","Knowing of the superb work that Max Pressof Great Bridge, Chesapeake, VA does, Iwas intrigued by the title of Taylor'sbook alone. It is a read that will notdisappoint but I can't go along with theauthor's questioning of God, et, al.Sort of a 'Ayn Rand-ian' feel to thebook but without her vulgarities. Mr.Taylor, who lost a leg in an accidentis a real optimistic guy and capitalist."
1,Fiction!,"Twyman has admitted that his tales are not ""completely"" true, but even so, this was a bland and disappointing book, with little to recommend it unless of course, you are willing to go along for the thrills of another manufactured miracle story."
4,mmmmm!,I bought mine from Wally World....didn't need it but it smelled like ice cream! Goes on a little on the heavy side but it does make your skin feel nice.
4,a great read,"Having read both The Guardian and The Protector by Ms. Ruth, I can say I throughly enjoyed both stories. The Protector brings us back into the world of those who protect us against all that goes bump in the night. It is set in today's world, yet all those stories of supernatural beings that are told as myths are real. This is the second book in the series and I hope for a continuation of this world that Ms. Ruth has created. Going back and visiting old friends and meeting new ones was fun. Hopefully she will be able to to write a third story in this series where magic is just around the corner."
5,Enjoyable beginning to a series,"Alana is a stage magician in Vegas, but as a descendent of the queen of the fae, she uses real magic. To stay in the mortal realm, an ancestor promised to protect mortals from the Otherworld and keep their secrets. Alana is the current Protector for Las Vegas. Unfortunately, a mortal serial killer is targeting those involved in magic for death, and Alana is the next one on his list. Detective Leo O'Grady is determined not to let another die at the hands of the Claddagh killer, and a fierce attraction develops.This book was much better than I expected. The author blends the elements of the paranormal, mystery, and romance with great skill. The characters and plot twists are very well done. I have already preordered the next book in the series."
4,Opportunity in Russia,"Alexander Elder,a New York-based, Russian immigrant provides a fascinating view of one of the most extraordinary developments of the late 20th century. The emergence of capitalism and democracy in Russian will be one of history's great chapters, full of stories about fortunes won and lost by intelligent investors. Elders' book captures all the hope and potential as well as the difficulties of the Russian people as they struggle with new ways of doing things and new ways of living. Written in clear, easy style, the book takes you through Russia's new economic structure; markets, stock offerings, investment options, etc. Additionally, since Elder is a pyschiatrist as well as investor, the book is full of insight into the Russian personality and the emerging struggle for economic stability.This book is fascinating for those with a global perspective, for those interested in developing countries, or for those interested in finding the next remarkable investment opportunity."
3,A persuasive argument to invest in Russia's bear market,"Dr. Alexander Elder, author of the bestselling Trading For a Living, makes the case in this book that long-term investors should start now acquainting themselves with Russia's upside potential. He offers insight into sectors, markets, funds, stocks, and specific strategies for investing in Russia while it is still down. A Russian emigre himself, and resident of both the U.S. and Russia, he is well positioned to argue this case and does so persuasively."
1,"Borrow, don't buy.","I'm very glad I did not purchase this book, and instead borrowed it on interlibrary loan through my public library. The painted photographs are a unique way to illustrate a story, and Valdemar is a strikingly handsome man, but the lack of substance in the plot and the two-dimensional characterization detract from true enjoyment of this short story/novella."
1,Why can't you give 0 stars?,"I fell for a pretty cover and ordered this book in hardback. I was totally disgusted when I found the book had zero story. I donated it to my library the very next day, with a warning that it WASN'T a children's book, despite the pictures. I almost tossed it in the trash, but doing that to any book goes against my nature. I hope my donation keeps some other poor person from wasting their money. If this book had been a movie, I would have gotten up in the first five minutes and demanded a refund."
5,The rest of the story....,"Authors Nik Douglas and Penny Slinger have written an extensively illustrated, beautiful and oversized art/coffee table book about Kuma Sutra, Tantric, Yoga and other Eastern Religion and sexual practices. For adults only."
1,Homophobic and Disjointed,"At first glance, this book might seem to have some valuable information for increasing our awareness of sexual possibilities. However, the writers' views of homosexuality were hateful and cliché (in fact, this book is quite 'lite' on any thoughtful or critical examination of source material). I strongly advise looking elsewhere for your sexuality information."
1,Homophobic and Inaccurate,Homosexuality is treated as a flaw to be overcome. It is said that practicing gay men can make no spiritual progress. Tantra and Yoga are offered as means by which one can cease being gay.Much of the historical notes were dated at the time of the book's original publication and only seem more so after so many years.
3,prety but deliate,"Beautiful ring, but my band broke two weeks after I got it. Be careful with it and it's a nice ring."
3,Now What do I do With it,"The ball arrived within a few days, but the excersize instructions were not included in the box. So now I have this ball, but have no clue what I'm supposed to do with it. I ordered this item through AMazon, but it was a new or used item through another source."
5,Informative,"A great book that examines hunting from an economic, cultural, and philosophical perspective. As a hunter it made me question my sport and left me with a deeper appreciation of the outdoors. As a nonhunter and member of various ""animal rights"" groups, I was told by my sister that it helped her to understand why I hunt and that she enjoyed the book even though she remains a nonhunter. An excellent book regardless of your agenda."
4,A must read for all hunters.,"This book presents a view of hunting not only from a hunter's standpoint, but from a biological and environmental standpoint. I think all kids should read this book, or read it with mom or dad, to really understand the necessity of hunting."
3,Timeless,"In one word Crime Story is ""Brilliant"".When you realise what the majority of the cast have accomplished since,it was a starting point for many of the most acclaimed actors of our time! A must see!"
5,MANN GREATNESS,"Every now and then TV gets it right and CRIME STORY is in that column. This epic was actually misplaced on the small screen: it could have revived serials with weekly theatre runs. The scaled down visuals and details were too limited to do the show justice. Had cable been in 1986 what it is now, CRIME STORY would certainly have had a different look (i.e, THE SHIELD being the most obvious) and probably played even more brutal than it had. Dennis Farina sets his own mark, but Lee Marvin's M-SQUAD Lt. Frank Ballinger, had to be in his subconscious (although Farina chewed his own share of real life Chi-Town cement with the CPD). Before self destructing at the mid point of Season 2, CRIME STORY was a joy. It was even more appreciated when Mann got to bring it full circle in 1995 with his masterwork, HEAT. Vincent Hanna and Mike Torello seperated at birth?"
3,This is the exact same set except for the box!,"Despite what some reviews have said this is the exact same season one dvd set that anchor bay released a while back except for the box. The songs on the first six episodes have all been replaced just like the first set. If you doubt me where is the ray charles ""what I say"" during the ray luca shoot out and car chase in ""the war"" episode? Just like the early dvd release all the songs seem correct after the 6th episode. All crime story episodes from the first season were originally broadcast in stereo (except the pilot) and anchor bay have chosen to release them in mono. The good news is anchor bay seems to have done everything right on season two, but they need to go back and rerelease season one in stereo and with correct songs."
1,Got the wrong movie,very unhappy I ordered crime stories and got mall cop. I dont have the time to ship it back so had to spend more money to get what I wanted.
2,Sorry excuse for a DVD set,"Content is an easy 5 stars, but the DVD transfer is terrible. The picture is so muddy and dark, and the color is uneven. If you have an older compilation on video, keep it. It's probably better than this major disappointment. No extras, no commentary, no nothing. Lt. Torello reserves better than that!"
5,This one is GREAT!,"We just got done watching Season One, and the next question is ""When do we get Season Two???"" Unless you are a real techno-snob, or have a 900"" screen TV, you will not notice any problems with the DVDs! The songs were great, the picture is just fine if you are like us...we have a 25"" normal TV and watch the story, not the pixels!We LOVED this show, and have waited since what? the 1980's to see it again. I can't believe they put stupid TV shows out on DVD right and left, and we have to wait and wait for the good ones! This is definitely one to buy, and there is nothing negative about it that we noticed!"
4,Crime Story Season One,"I love this show. If you like the Sopranos and other Mob or Mafia type movies, you will love this. I watched it when it was on and couldn't wait til the next week would get here to see what was going to happen next. FYI- Season two will be out this month."
2,Not Top Drawer,This is the poorest of the Deanna Durbin movies (not her fault). I purchased it because I am an avid Deanna Durbin fan and want anything available with Durbin. What could have been a nice musical was ruined by having most of the songs from the Broadway musical cut from the film version. Technicolor would also have helped. There is a newly released CD of the movie soundtrack which includes more of the music and that CD is great.
3,Buddha Board Joy,I love the Buddha Board and use it for doing loose sketches each morning before I go in to my studio to start painting. The only down side to this is that the board came with a small scratch and the brush that came with the board came apart after one use!
3,Great for Calligraphy Practice,The buddha board was given to me as a gift from a good friend.At first I wasn't too sure what to do with it. But then I realized it was a great way to practice my Calligraphy.Please check out my blog to see pictures of my work: [...]I hope that with practice my calligraphy can get as good as my mom's.
5,nice,this was a gift to a 29 yr old guy recoveringfrom surgery. he loved it......so you see: it's not justa 'toy'.
4,Zen toy for an adult,"I got this for my husband for Christmas 2 years ago. It's a cool ""zen"" doodle board for him during work. Now my 2 year old daughter likes to play with it and it's great that it's just water so I don't have to worry about spills. She thinks it's cool that it dries and disappears. Would recommend for both adults and kids!"
1,pathetic delivery,"I wouldn't know how many stars to give this item because it was ordered almost 3 weeks ago and I still have not seen it. I was given a tracking number the day after it was ordered, that's a start...but then FenFen went on vacation for a few weeks. You would think Christmas would be the time to send orders out!! I would advise you to get your budda board from any supplier other than this one."
1,I fall to pieces,had one of these for two seasons and at the end of the second season(last weekend) the reel broke into pieces when i tried to reel the hose out.
5,easy to put together and looks great,this Craftsman inspired furniture is very easy to put together and looks great in my living room. I have several pieces from Home Decorators and I've been pleased with every one of them.
4,A practical guide to kicking that anyone can use.,"Roy Kurban's training methods work for anyone that will follow this book. Having earned my black belt in Roy Kurban's karate school in Arlignton, TX. The book follows his instruction programs in use at his school with his black belts instructors."
5,Dragon's Fire,An awesome book!! I love McCaffrey's way of transporting the reader to the world of Pern where dragons & their riders keep everyone safe!! Well written & fine fiction!!! I'd buy it again!!
1,Time to let go of Pern,"I have been unable to find a way to contact Ms. Mccaffrey. I am hopeful that she may read this review. It is time to end the Dragon series. Her son, Todd is not up to the task. Dragon's fire is a disjointed, confusing, poorly written novel. The introduction of ""hokey"" healing practices, and downtroden classes such as the ""shunned"" have no place in Pern. I have been a fan of Pern for many years and have in my collection, several first additions of the series, including a rather beat up copy of Dragonriders. They are among my favorite novels. I would rather see the series end than to have it passed on to an inferior writer."
5,A Great Addition to the Pern Series!,"I love how the books continue to unravel whats and hows of Pern's history.In this book, a Harper who doesn't talk, the son of a shunned miner and an orphaned girl find a better way for dragons to produce flame to burn the thread that will be coming soon."
1,Too different,"I have read all of the Pern novels and own all of Anne's in hardback, but I read a library copy of this one and I'm glad I didn't buy it. All that makes it a Pern novel are the setting and the dragonriders. I couldn't tell where it fell chronologically, and the idea of the Shunned seems unfitting for Pern. the story jumps around and I had trouble keeping the characters straight. The ""dramatis personae"" (why the fancy sounding name?) at the beginning did not include Moran or Aleesa or Arella.The book did not hold my interest. The biggest disappointment is that the magic is gone."
1,Reads like microwaved leftovers taste,"I'm sorry to say this is by far the worst writing I've read in a long while. Calling it a young adult's book is no excuse, as there are many worthy titles in that category. As another reader describes it, the characters, timeline, and locations are impossible to follow...and what's worse, I am halfway through and I don't really care to finish. Perhaps I should at least try, as at least the two main characters are likeable even if I have no idea where they are, where they've been, or what their purpose is. (Having finished reading now, I can confirm that the book remains poorly written through to the end.)"
1,Anne McCaffrey is not here.,"Annie's name may be on the cover, but she is not in this book. The torch was passed to Todd and it has gone out. Unfortunatly for Todd, writing talent is not an inherited trait - he does not come close to his mother's talent and I get the sense that Anne has very little input in these new novels. I've continued to read each new one hoping, hoping... My only hope is that Anne will return (if her health allows) to writing her novels alone."
2,No dragons (AGAIN),"I am just SO tired of Pern books with no dragons (except for ferrying people around). Be warned, this is another wandering kids book."
2,Saddening,"I've loved Pern since I was a teen. Lessa, Robinton, F'lar, Moreta, Menolly, all of the characters became friends I visited again and again. Sadly, the newer books don't have the ""magic"" that the early ones did. Nor do the voices of the co-writers blend well. The narrative is bland, and while the mute Harper boy is an intriguing concept, the whole story is cardboard, like BAD fanfic. I fear fans will have to look for good fanfiction to continue Pern, as some of that is better than this latest professional entry."
2,Why????,"Is Anne Mccaffrey losing her falculties that she is just aggreeing to allow her son to write these ""stories""? Anne, take your meds and open your eyes, your son is destroying the Pern series. Stop agreeing with him. Stop writing with him. He is ruining your masterpiece. Everytime I see a new Pern book with todd McCafrey's name on it, I cringe. I read it in the store first. If I like half the story, then I will buy it. This story is ridiculous. A mute harper? harpers are supposed to teach through song. How does a mute harper do this, through sign language? The ""Shunned"" reminds me of the ""others"" in Lost. I miss my heros, Lessa, F'Lar, Brekke, Menoly, Robinton, F'Nor, T'gellan, etc. I miss my heros.Long live Pern, it was great while it lasted. May it rest in peace."
4,easier to swallow than a mouthful of firestone,"A great plot revolving around the need to mine the dangerous firestone necessary to supply the dragons of Pern, with the means to destroy the parasitic thread which threatens all life on Pern. A richly detailed world. Dragon's fire focuses on four intriguing characters : Pellar (a mute harpist), Halla (a young girl of the Shunned) and Cristov the son of a disgraced miner, and the evil Tenim ( a thief and worse)...it s about the dangers of mining Firestone and what to do with the Shunned...I will be looking out for other Pern novels..."
3,It's ok,Still trying to read this one. It starts real slow and I haven't been able to get into the book like I normally do.
1,The apple fell far from the tree!,"I am severely displeased with Todd McCaffrey's writing. It's sappy, sugarcoated, and the stuff of Disney princess movies. The corny ending made me gag and I cannot believe Anne McCaffrey chose this moron as her prodigy for Pern. Surely there are better writers out there who can continue the legacy of Pern...anyone!? I am saddened to see how Todd McCaffrey is desecrating the world of Pern one book at a time. If there were a lower rating than one star, that is what I would give this vile waste of paper."
1,"Terrible, simply terrible","I wanted to like this book. I was mildly disappointed by Dragon's Kin and EXTREMELY disappointed at Dragon's Blood. I am 32 years old and I have been reading Pern adventures for over 20 years. There is no feeling or heart in Todd's books. Everything is so perfunctory. I feel like I'm going through a checklist from a bad screenplay. Children die. Check. Fire lizards die. Check. People die. Check. Character development is so lacking that the reader could really care less when something ""significant"" occurs.The saddest thing is that this doesn't seem like Anne's Pern at all. It's not consistent with what I know of it. Obscure, irrelevant, extreme events occur for the sake of pushing the story. Nothing about it seems natural. Nothing about it flows. If Todd had writer's block during the creation of this book, it's obvious by the stinted, stilted storying telling. Maybe he should stick to computer science."
1,A huge disappointment,"I have read every Pern book written, most of them several times, and I am sorry I wasted my time reading this one even once. Where was the editor? The book rambles, the plot jumps around, and the storyline is quite confusing. I liked Pellar, the main character, but most of the other characters were so minimally developed that you don't understand them or care about them. If you are new to Pern and the Dragonriders, please go read the early series, they were terrific. Don't judge by this one."
3,Anne's Kid Is OK,"Todd McCaffrey's latest work carries on quite well his mother's legacy of Pern's dragonriders. Since she is listed as co-author, I'm guessing she has more than a finger in these books, but I believe Pern is in good hands with her son. As I read, I found myself thinking ""this is familiar"", then it occurred to me that Dragon's Fire is a continuation of the lives of some of the characters introduced in Dragon's Kin. I found it interesting to look at some of the same incidents from more than one character's point of view when comparing the two books."
2,A disappointment,"I love the Pern novels and was quite excited to see a new one. What a disappointment! Too much crammed into one book and none of it done well. The story lines would have made great books on their own (the firestone problem, the shunned, the mute harper, the watchweirs) but by trying to include it all in the same book, the story lines lost any impact they may have had. The characters were not well devleoped, the timelines became confused. What a mess!Better would have been to create multiple books with overlapping characters and better develop the story lines. Anne has certainly done it before and it has worked really well.While it is in my collection, I doubt I will read it very often."
3,Dragons Fire,"Todd McCaffrey, is playing in Anne McCaffrey's world of Pern. And whereas he is an interesting author, his style is more plodding than Anne's. That could be because of her developing the universe or his fear of being allowed to play freely with her universe. With Anne's death I was hoping that Todd, could write more convincingly in the world of Pern, but it just doesn't seems to be possible.Or maybe it is just easier to imitate the Pooh stories or even to bastardize Tolkien. But Pern, just doesn't seem work for the second generation of Mccaffrey family writers."
3,Transition novel.,"Dragon's Fire is a transition novel to link Dragon Kin to Dragon Harper. Writing was ok, story was ok. Worth reading to tie the rest together but not up to the standards of Dragon Harper. Pellar almost became a comedy being he could not be killed. Like I said....worth reading."
3,Dragon's fire,"""Dragon's Fire"" is a collaboration between Anne McCaffrey and her son Todd McCaffrey and at times, it is rough going though thankfully the collaboration improves as time goes by. In ""Dragon's Fire"", the settlers have been on Pern for almost 500 Turns and memories of Old Earth are starting to fade. The mining operations for firestone continue and Pern prepares for the return of the deadly Red Star and its annihilating Thread. Only three things can stop Threads: water, solid rock, and the fire of the great, genetically engineered dragons of Pern. The Shunned are also important parts of the story. There is the Shunned girl Halla and the journeyman harper Moran who was supposed to be on a secret mission to learn more about the Shunned, but mysteriously vanishes. Pellar joins Masterharper Zist in a search for Moran, a missing Journeyman Harper and this leads to a remarkable discovery."
1,Ugh.,"Glad to see I'm not the only one who can't stand this book. There is nothing to redeem the inferior writing, fractured plot, inconsitancies (a dragon changed color! OMG, hire an editor, for crimminy's sake!), and completely undeveloped characters. Weyerleaders act like petulant children, showing the worst characterists of previous ""real"" McCaffery characters. The main character is alternately distrusted, then suddenly trusted, then shot at, then trusted again, for little apparent reason. And firestone plain old does not kill dragons--ask a real writer, Todd. You stink."
4,worth reading,"While several people have said bad things about this book I really enjoyed it. Todd's style isn't quite the same as his mother's and that may be the reason for some of the negative reviews. But he brings some fresh ideas and I, for one, love that."
4,give the book a chance!!,"most of the reviews have ripped the book apart, however, i don't think the book deserved such negative reviews. yes, the story jumps around but it's a good story that pern lovers should read. i love the characters Pellar and Halla and want more stories with them involved. of course, nothing can be as good as the first 2 series(sorry Todd) but dragon's fire and dragon's kin give pern lovers another side of pern which is interesting."
2,a pale shadow of Anne McCaffrey,Fans of Anne McCaffrey's Pern series will want to give a pass this attempt by her son to repeat her success. It is a lackluster telling of what could have been an excellent tale. Todd McCaffrey has none of his mother's talent for involving the reader in the tale or character development. The characters lack depth and the story line jumps and jerks rather than gliding from chapter to chapter.
4,Pern is a comfortable escape,"Anne McCaffrey's Pern is a favorite retreat of mine ever since I read 'Dragonflight' back in the 1970s. Some of the books are better than others, but all have familiar characters and those marvelous dragons.This latest in the saga of Pern nicely fills in more details about the planet and its fight with the carbon-devouring Thread, but it does not rank among those that I'll read over and over again. Lessa, F'lar, and Robinton are marvelous creations, as are Sean, Sorka, Admiral Bendon, Emily Boll, and Kit Ping. Pellar and Halla are good but don't quite rise to the levels of other Pernese.Still, it's always a treat to be taken off to this world where humans fight against their own weaknesses and limitations as well as the strange forces on their new chosen home. With little more than natural abilities and ingenuity they succeed in making steps forward in their respective quests."
1,Passing the baton but not the talent,"I have to say that I'm truely disappointed in Todd McCaffrey's writing, and this book in particular. It makes no sense and seems to be about 15 wildly different stories all crammed together with no thought to comprehensibility. I'm a long time Pern and McCaffrey fan, and I'm truely shocked that she even let this out the door, much less on the shelves. I've read better fanfic. I'm just glad I checked it out from the library rather than automatically buying it. I think I'm planning on just skipping anything else of Todd's because this was so terrible. I even almost didn't finish it but held out hope that it would somehow all come together in the end. Didn't happen. So I recommend, Don't waste your time. Get some Robin Hobb or something good."
2,Dragonfireout,"This book has nearly quenched my desire to read any more of the dragon series. The three young male characters seem to have interchangeable personalities. The story seems to meander without any real focus. We have a much overused reuse of the arrogant wyerleader theme. The bad guy vs one of the young male characters is poorly detailed and repetitive. I've read the 9th pass books and all of the ones prior to this one except Dragoneye and so far this is the worst one I've encountered. If you're trying to read all of the series, then I guess you'll read this one, but don't expect much."
1,Continues to diverge from Anne McCaffrey's world,"Todd McCaffrey's version of Pern continues to depart from the world his mother created - full of Mary Sues, Gary Stus, and political correctness. Todd's books are more like an extensive fan-fiction world, allowing for things that his mother permitted in fan fiction, but would never have allowed in her own written world.I purchased and read three of Todd McCaffrey's books in this extended universe Pern series, but will not consider them part of canon Pern, and will not be purchasing any more of Todd's books."
2,Very disappointing,"I've read most of the other reviews and the negative ones really say it all for me. Todd is not his mother (regretfully) and I truly wonder where his mother was while he was writing this disjointed and sad story? Perhaps she's not comfortable editing his work. In any case, unless Todd develops better writing skills the Pern saga will end. Thread couldn't defeat Pern but Todd just might do the job."
4,"Hard to find a good insulin case, but this works...","With everyone focused on pens these days, it's hard to find a good carry-all for bottles and syringes. This one holds everything you need - needles, alcs, and two bottles.The pocket design can make it tricky to get the bottles in and out (you have to push one to the side and try to slide the other past it), but it has the advantage of being able to accommodate those oddly-proportioned lantus bottles. My old case used elastic bands to hold the bottles, which made it easier to put them in and take them out, but the bands were too big for lantus bottles. They also gradually stretched out, making the bottles prone to slip out. The pocket design is much more flexible and durable in that sense.Nice color to this one, too. And good material. Tough, but lightweight. I'm sure it'll serve well for years."
1,Wasted my money,"The diabetic carry all case is very thin and flimsy, it would be very easy for the materials inside to become damanged with little force. Additonally, I assumed I would receive the color that was advertised but I didn't. I have not used this product."
5,Love Mujhse Dosti Karoge!,This is one of my FAVORITE Hindi films! It's such a great story and the dvd is good quality. Highly recommended!
3,A good short-term listen,"Although probably the best Of Montreal album, The Sunlandic Twins fall short when it comes to it's longevity. This is an album that you can't just listen to over and over and still enjoy it at the same level. The songs, although catchy for the first 2/3 of the CD, sort of fade in quality towards the end of the album. After a week or two, the songs quickly get old leaving you wanting to listen to something different. It's a great CD to listen to every once in a while but if you're looking for something that you can listen to day in and day out, you won't find it here, but catchy songs like I Was Never Young, Wraith Pinned to the Mist and Other Games, and Forecast Fascist Future, make the album worth taking a look at."
3,"A fun album full of good melodies, but weak everything else.","There are plenty of obvious virtues to this album. The guitar rings of 60's pop, and every song has a fun, well formed melody which can't help but remind me of Piper At The Gates of Dawn era Floyd. On the whole, The Sunlandic Twins sounds like a more upbeat dance-pop take on psychadelia. It has a few huge drawbacks, though. Beyond a nice melody and a general fun sound, there isn't much depth to the album, and the songs are very homogeneous. With the exception of the last track, which has a lo-fi sound and is carried by it's bassline, there's little or no variation in this album's sound. Some people will like this album a lot, and others will be immediately underwhelmed. If the idea of retro-pop with a slightly higher tempo and lots of synthesizers intrigues you, maybe you should consider buying this album. Otherwise, skip it.(My actual rating: 5.5/10)"
3,"Decent, but has some rough","Ok, I admit. there are a few good points on the album, but as a whole, I find it difficult to really groove along with it. the previous one was utterly fantastic, but something seems to have changed between then and now (only a year mind you). To be honest, nothing in the song has any particular hook except, maybe, So Begins Our Alabee in which the entire sung part is the hook. Beyond this and The Party's Crashing Us, nothing caught my ear. Oh and why 3 instrumentals? I have no problem with them if they grab onto you like ""Coquelicot, Claude and Lecithin Dance Aboard The Yacht"" or the tail end of ""The Hopeless Opus"", both found on ""Coquelicot Asleep In The Poppies"", but none of those found on this record is really that memorable. All in all, ok as background music, but not so great to focus your attention on."
2,Experimental art prioritizing good songs,"I was turned onto Of Montreal from a friend of mine who's way into them. My intrigue led me to purchase this album partly do to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Take one part melodies from the Beatles, Seals and Crofts, and jarring dash of Bill Bruford, add seven parts meandering electronic backdrop for said melodies, top it all off with an absolute aversion to forming a coherent song, and you have Of Montreal's ""The Sunlandic Twins"". There's an abundance of creepy low budget circus like synth sounds -- flutes, strings, organs, etc. -- and almost every song has annoying overly dramatic choral like ""oh's"" throughout. If that sounds like something you'd enjoy then please check this album out. I clearly couldn't get into it."
4,Not your ordinary 'cookie',"This is one of my favorite cookiesI was turned on to this while working in MexicoDescription:The outer layers are much more like a cracker, not really sweet at all and the slightest hint of saltThey are lightly 'glazed' with sugarThe filling is a light lime flavored cream, similar in consistency to what you would expect in a lemon sandwich cookie without the sugar overloadThe combination is nice, not overly sweet, a bit dry, with a little lime finishBecause they are not so sickly sweet, they are quite filling, with one pack of six usually doing the trickMy fellow co-workers, even the Mexican nationals, don't often get why I like them so much, but I do.If you are not a fan of super sweet cookies, give them a tryA little different can be a really good thing."
5,Oh my God,"For those of you out there who plan on having a family, read this book first. For those of you who already have a family and working long hours and missing time with your family, read this book. This is a journey I shall never forget. It makes you think. This is an extremly talanted young writer. When you sit down to read it and you begin to see the faces , smell the food cooking and feel all their pain, honey that is good writing!! There is power in the pages. I laughed and cried and laughed again!! Please, if you never read another book, read this one. I read it in 1 1/2 days. WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL BOOK"
2,Monty Norman's James Bond,"As a HUGE fan of 007 I spent a lot of effort in the 70's tracking down ALL the soundtracks. I'm afraid this is my 2nd-least-favorite (MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN's at the bottom for me). Never mind the controversy still going on as to whether Norman or Barry wrote ""The James Bond Theme""-- the BEST VERSION EVER which appears here! It's the fact that like too many others, this album does not accurately reflect the film. And it took me years to realize why. Much of what appears here was CUT from the film when John Barry was called in at the last minute. And none of Barry's contributions appear here! (""Shocking..."" --sorry, wrong film!) And I find the repetition of some tunes here irritating. It was hoped ""Under the Mango Tree"" would become a hit single (which is why it replaced the standard, ""Maryanne"", that was in the book.) At least ""Jump Up"" is a fun number! (But did it have to be here TWICE?)"
1,The worst of the Bond scores,"After listening to this mess it is not hard to see why Monty Norman wasn't invited back to work on other Bond films. His score as used in the film is hammy and old fashioned, ""mining disaster music"" as director Terence Young called it. On the record a lot of music never heard in the film replaces it. Poor cues like 'Audio Bongo' and Twisting with James' abound. There is a track called 'James Bond Theme' which is nothing like the JB theme we know and love but is another version of the melody used in 'Twisting with James'. Norman says that the record company made a mess of the track listings on the original album but it is more than possible that this was one of his original versions of the James Bond Theme that drove the producers to bring in John Barry to save the day.Worth having for completeness but do not expect a great listening experience."
3,NOT MANY SONGS THAT WERE IN THE MOVIE.,"The Dr. No soundtrack isn't as good as the others, but the others had more of a foundation to build their music on than Dr. No. They had no idea that they were creating one of the most popular action heroes ever and music. So Dr. No should get some credit. Although I was rather disappointed in the lack of music from the film. Pretty much the only music that is on the soundtrack that appeared in the film are tracks: 1 (The James Bond theme),2 (Kinston Calypso), 4 (Jump Up), & 13 (The Island Speaks). Minus 2 stars for the missing tracks, but 3 stars for originality and effort. Pretty much a good buy if you absolutely love James Bond, but think twice before buying it if you're just looking for a good CD."
2,Doctor No John Barry (Not CompleteCredit) Monty Norman ?,"When you compare Volume 1 & 2 Music To Read James Bond By John Barry, while also listen to Basie Meets Bond With Count Basie And Orchestra they understand the real composer """"JOHN BARRY"""" Who lost out on the copyright but at the last minute composed the original James Bond Medley and does not get credit. If you notice in original movie does not include full song medley of James Bond Medley.The score is duct taped with harsh sounds and does not give the movie it's full honors with music style.John Barry no credit for his contribution. The jazz calipso Monty Norman did not give John Barry film score director debut his bow. Sad,Tragic."
2,"Actually, it's not that good","Although ""Dr. No"" is one of my favourite movies, this soundtrack just isn't. This was intended to be a ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"", right? So why are there many many tracks missing?I'm very sorry, but I can't do anything with this kind of Calypso music. Although it worked good in the movie, it's very hard to like the music alone."
5,We all love this book,This book is part of our homeschool curriculum [...] and we absolutely LOVE it. I love all the old stories from other countries and the hidden lesson in each. My children love the colorful characters and the suspense in each one. I hope there are more like it in the years to come. Currently my children are ages 7 & 9.
3,"cute, but fragile","My little guy, 18 months old, loved our canister vacuum so I thought this would be perfect. He loves his little vacuum, but the clips that hold the pole and attachments came out the third time we used it. The pieces stay on (for now) without the clip, which is small enough to be a choking hazard."
1,caveat emptor,"The good: This toy is basically an exact scale model of a real Miele vacuum, and you can turn it on and off (though it doesn't pick up anything) and even has 2 of the three attachments that regular Miele vacuums have. So your son/daughter can vacuum along with you, though be prepared to explain why your real vacuum has a brush attachment and theirs doesn't.The bad: The 2-foot long plastic tube that connects the hose to the brush does not click on as it should, it just slides on..and off, after about 5 seconds of usage, rendering the product basically useless. And good luck trying to get your money back as this is not sold through Amazon but another merchant. If the manufacturer put a tiny bit more thought into the product it would be fantastic, but as it is it is a waste of money."
3,Miele toy Vacuum,"Bought this for a 3 yr old who loved our Miele canister and would try to vacuum with it whenever he came over. In the beginning it was a big hit. But just for a short while. Quickly his interest waned. It was a gimmick gift on our part and in that respect, it served its' purpose."
5,GREAT!,"Our daughter loves to emulate us in everything we do, including chores. This little guy looks just like our real vac except small enough for her to handle. The sound is authentic (but not too loud) and it doesn't eat up batteries too much (our original ones have been in there 2 years now!). We never did use the styrofoam bits that it's supposed to clean up. That would be a mess and I see nothing wrong with exercising her imagination a bit. Survived many drops down the stairs. Highly recommend. Lots of fun."
1,This vacuum doesn't have much suction,My son wanted a vacuum that works. this one only can vacuum small styrafoam balls.... he lost interest after an hour....
1,BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK -- PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,THIS IS THE WORST VACUUM EVER - WE HAVE EVERY SINGLE TOY VACUUM OUT THERE AND THEY ARE ALL PRETTY GOOD BUT THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND THE CHEAPEST BUILT - IT IS SO TINY!IT WAS BROKE THE FIRST NIGHT - IT DOESN'T SUCK AT ALL!! WELL IT DOES SUCK - BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT THE LITTLE STYROFOAM BEADS THAT COME WITH IT! OR EVEN THE LIGHTEST PIECE OF LINT - WITH SHIPPING AND TAX THIS ITEM WAS $40.00 AND I WILL LOOSE ALMOST $15.00 IN TOTAL SHIPING TO GET IT HERE AND TO SEND IT BACK ! I AM STILL RETURING IT AND BUYING A REAL CANISTER VACUUM FOR $20.00 AT WALMART - PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
2,Drawbacks overwhelm the positives,"I bought this camcorder for my wife. After using it for a while, we just stopped. Indoor pictures, even with lights on, are very grainy. And unfortunately, we would shoot a lot indoors.In order to move the video to a computer, you need a Firewire cable and Firewire on your computer, and additional software not supplied with the camcorder. I wouldn't mind this, execpt the camcorder also has USB connectivity. Everyone has USB, but you can't send the video over USB, only still pics.The basic shooting controls are easy enough to figure out, but beyond that, the controls are very unintuitive. The control panel tucked in where the LCD screen comes out has myriad buttons, and it's not obvious what they all do.I remember shortly after I bought this, Consumer Reports came out with their evaluations of Camcorders. This one was at the very bottom of the ones they rated, and in my opinion, for good reason."
1,"Fixed it once, then broke again","After buying camera, worked fine then i started having to reset it constantly. I sent it in, came back working fine. Same thing started up again, and now i cant play back. Also, terrible quality when filming indoors. Very grainy."
3,works OK but wouldn't hold rubber eyepiece,really corrects the image sharpness but rubber eyepiece wouldn't hold on it very well. Already lost mine this way.
1,Is This A Joke?,"What a waste of time and money. This turd is written at a 5th grade level, full of paranoid ramblings and pointless sensationalized fear-mongering. It has no value to enlighten or inform in any meaningful way. One of the three 'authors' purports to hold a PhD; given the style and level of the writing I'd be very interested to know what institute of higher learning he pretends its from. Yet another 'author' is credited as performing the all important typing of this masterpiece.Save your money and ignore this pathetic, sad little dissertation of ignorance."
2,Could not get into this book.....,"Just wasn't for me...I guess. I tried to read the first few chapters, but could not get into it. However, Bishop Bloomer is a great minster and a great speaker, so it might be just right for you."
1,Faded picture + Childish acting + Ridiculous plot,- The picture is faded.- The acting is stiff and childish.- The plot is ridiculous.- Jack Palance is good in other movies made in the 90's not this which was made in the 70's.- It's a huge waste of my money.
2,Not that Revealing,"The book is not that enlightening. It is muddled in it's explanations of Islamic beliefs and (as everyone noted before me, from both sides of the issue) is clearly biased (anti-Islam). It has some basic truths and yet it presents them in such a way that any real understanding of Islam is very hard to get at. It exaggerates the differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs and gives the impression they are in no way related, when in fact, Muslims and Christians worship the same god. I would recommend, if you are interested in learning anything about the basics of the religion, you not read this book. Check out ""The Complete Idiots Guide to Islam"". It's a much better book than this tired propaganda."
2,Defending his ideas,"I read this book and find that most of its contents are easily refutable by any average Muslim. In a historic debate, with Dr.Shorrosh Dr. Jamal Badawi took this task upon himself, and quite successfully I must say. For those of you interested, the debate is available in real video format under the Islamcity site under cybertv under ch21-debates."
1,Take note...,For all those who are interested in reading this book (after reading the glowing tributes paid to it by ignorant and biased christians) please note that the author is a proven and blatant LIAR. If you are truly in search of truth and not simply looking to strengthen what you want to believe( as must be the case with most of the people writing here) then you owe it to yourself to at least know about this man more before taking his word for the truth. Read his book but please visit http://www.ahmed-deedat.co.za/homepage.asp to purchase a video of a stunning debate that took place between dr anis and sheikh ahmed deedat (a famous muslim sholar)as a companion peace to this book. Believe me you will learn a lot more that way...that is if you really are in search of TRUTH!
5,A GREAT BOOK IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD,WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT IT TELL THE DIFFERENTBETWEEN A CHRISTIAN AND A MUSLIM AND HOW GOD IS A SPIRITSAND MUHAMMAD IS A MAN AND ON PAGE 102 IT TELL YOU THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN JESUS AND MUHAMMAD READ THIS PAGE AND YOU TELL ME IS THIS A FIVE STAR BOOK.
3,Predominantly a comment regarding the first reviewer,"First of all, I would like to admit that I have not yet read this book. I was searching through the reviews to decide whether or not this book would help me to better understand Islam. I've been interested in Islam for some time now, going back and forth between the pros and cons, but I must admit that after reading comments by the reviewer from March 8 (which was a negative, one-star review), I will definitely buy the book and read it now. For shame, Sir, that someone would resort to that kind of immature name-calling, directed toward a man who took the time to write a book and share his experiences and knowledge. In my estimation, this reviewer goes a long way toward proving Muslim sentiments toward Americans today. Congratulations. Wouldn't it been enough to simply say, ""I didn't like the book""?"
1,Not worth more than 60 cents!,"Plenty of contradictions stated in this piece. Not worth more than 60 cents! I would rather read books by REAL historians such as Marmaduke Pickethall, british historians who lived for an extensive period of their lives in Muslim countries rather than countries that incorporate religious mixtures."
3,Not a typical Arab Christian View About Islam!,"Islam and Christianity have much more in common than differences. This book will undoubtably bring about more bad then good. It is flame bait. Imagine a Jew writing a book with an agenda to prove that Jesus was an imposter and the New Testament is full of contradictions etc. What good could such a book bring? How would such a book affect the Christian view of the Jew? Christians would be enraged! That is exactly what Anis has done. Ironically the Jews are nearer to the Christians though the Jew rejects Jesus while the Muslim already believes in Jesus as a Messenger of God and in Mary as a saintly women ""siddeeqah"", the virgin birth, Jesus' miracles... The Muslim should be much nearer to the Christian. We should write books that bring these two great world religions together not that which would start a war. BTW I saw the debate between Anis and Deedat on the issue of ""Is Jesus God"". It was really enlightening.Peace to all,"
1,If you really want to know,"Anyone who could read one book and decide to change their faith never believed in their faith initially. The only people this book could influence are those who know nothing about Islam. Not everyone like myself, has the benefit of seeing Dr.Shorrosh live in debate against qualified students of Islam, who show that Dr.Shorrosh's knowledge of Islam is superficial at best. He distorts the text in the Qur'an so as to cast doubt in the younger and less informed Muslim mind. In fact the Qur'an makes mention of such people. All I can really say, is that if you feel this book has a point and you really need to find out, go get the video of the debate Dr.Shorrosh has with Mr.Deedat in Royal Albert Hall, and when you see him singing, yes thats right singing his way out of proving his claims you can judge for yourself."
5,"The truth, and nothing but the truth.","I was deeply impressed by the substance and evidence put forth by Dr. Shorrosh. He speaks the truth; those who are ready for it will hear, and those who aren't, won't. This man radiates from head to toe, the pure and perfect love of Jesus, and it spills over into his work.If ever there were a time for this book, it is now. If you read it without a hardened heart, with a sincere desire to seek the truth, and faith that the truth will make itself known, you will indeed find it.Paraphrasing what Dr. Shorrosh has mentioned in his own fashion, the traditions of man have made the Word of God of no effect. Our only freedom and salvation is in Jesus...not in the well-meaning manners and customs of cultural religiosity. This is one of the things Jesus told the Pharasees, but they never understood or accepted the messaage."
5,Islam exposed,"reading this book gives you comparisons.As a Christian,we need to be as informed as possible to other mindsets. Nadia REhmani author of Sharper Than A Two Edged sword,that is my story of my walk into Islam and out.Read it.Nadia"
5,Excellent,Excellent book to read. Would recommend it to everyone. My handicapping is 100% better since I read it. Getting 95% winners. Thank You
5,How to get the free USB as indicated in the previous post?,I purchased this a month ago. ITs awesome.I spent 17$ to get the cd today. But now I do not have the usb cable. I noticed in the previous post that the reviewer mentioned that reviewer got the free usb in the mail.Can you please share the info on how to get it so that others can benefit as well.

4,Great,For some weir reason I have tried to enter a review of this 5 times so this is brief.Check out my other Manhattan Jazz Trinity reviews.Expensive but worth it.Support Jazz Foundation Of America at www.jazzfoundation.comChazz
2,A novel about writing a novel,"If you are expecting that this novel will share the stories of Simon's interviewees, there are only about 10 pages worth reading. The novel is more about her own cross-country journey to do these interviews, which is much more mundane than the short excerpts about the lives of others. The heavy slant toward medication as ""the"" treatment option for bipolar disorder also distracts from the stories of Simon and her subjects."
5,Everyone with Bipolar or a mental disorder should read this book!,"I honestly feel like I know Lizzie Simon. She could be my sister (and in a mental-disorder-kind-of-way she is). Anyone who has Bipolar disorder will recognize themselves in Ms. Simon. The book is touching, disturbing, funny, quirky, warm, moody and brilliant (just like all of us ""Bipolars"").If you or someone you know and love has a mental disorder of any kind, you owe it to yourself to read this one (and other similar books) to get educated about the disease and learn how to live fully and successfully with it."
5,"""Detour..."" a road to be taken","""Detour ..."" is a road to be taken; it is a riveting read. It speeds you along at a breathless pace. ""Stop,"" ""Wait"" the author says, but you can't stop, and don't want to wait. For those who fear the subject matter may be too dark, one need only look at the splendid life Lizzie Simon has fashioned for herself to be reassured. For those who think the subject matter holds little interest, be assured that learning about what may be going on in somebody's head is fascinating, horrifying, gripping, and extends far beyond defining what bipolar can be. Anybody who has thought about Sartre's ""No exit,"" will understand Lizzie Simon's book. And, to quote Pope, ""The proper study of mankind is man."" Buy this book. You'll thank me.Beatrice Williams-Rude"
4,Bipolar awareness,"It is sometimes hard to follow the trauma of the various lives in this book, but some examples aremore uplifting than others. The success of the author's journey is inspiring to anyone who hassuffered from bipolar affective disorder. The best lesson is to speak openly about this and othermental diseases since we now know that they are generally chemical imbalances [highly treatable withdrugs] and not moral failings. And it is not possible to ""Just snap out of it!""Highly recommended for those with AND without this disorder."
2,Cute Idea but not very practicle,"My daughters were so excited to get this. Anthing Princess is great. However it has three sections to blow up. The mattress itself seems to be made well, although you have to buckle the three sections together or there is a big gap between each one. The cover is what disappointed me. It was cute with the princesses on it but not much of a sleeping bag. More of a nylon cover that is zipped onto the part that holds the mattress in. Not very warm at all. When I think of a sleeping bag I think cozy warm. This is not that at all. I don't know about the chair part. I guess it is ok. We will be returning them and trying the Disney Princess ready bed."
5,OASIS loves Dr. Trotter's Books.,"Older Adult Service and Information Systems, a group of more than 300,000 older Americans Nationwide are avid gardeners and use Dr. Trotter's books as educational materials for our members. His work is easy to understand and practice. Dr. Trotter approaches organic gardening with logic and common sense."
1,Warning - Do Not Buy - Warning,"We used this software for several years and recently had to upgrade to the new version 4.0 because the older version 3.0 would not install on new Windows 7 systems. The new version cannot open any label files we created from the old version. So we have to start over. We called Nova Development's Tech Support and they basically told us that the company doesn't care about upgrading existing customers and that new versions would typically not read the files from old versions. If you have a business and plan to print the same labels for some time, look for other solutions and stay away from this software."
3,wishing for more,This program is OK. I guess. I really wish I could run sheets of different labels instead of having to print one at a time. It is not very user friendly although the graphics are ok for what I needed.
5,The Use of Label Factory Deluxe 3.0,"I have used the prior programs also, and find that this one keeps up with the quality of its predecessors, Just a Great Program when used correctly and according to the Instruction Manual... and a always Amazon is the place to find and purchase items such as this one..Walleye22in"
4,It does work as advertised,Not the easiest software to learn to use. Big download to make it Vista compatible. Need to insert second disk to get the second half of the art work. But it does work as advertised. I'd buy it again.
3,This looks a lot like Avery's free software,"I was trying to print some return address labels using this software. I found that it did not contain a template I needed, for Avery's 5195/8195 return address labels (2/3"" by 1 3/4""). So, I was looking for some alternative software for my labels. I ended up on Avery's site, downloaded their free software, and lo and behold, it seemed nearly identical to THIS software, except that it has up-to-date label templates. So, my guess is that Avery bought up this software, which explains why this software hasn't been updated in quite some time.Perhaps this software offers some additional artwork and fonts...I don't really know. But what I do know is that I am uninstalling this software in favor of the free and more up-to-date Avery software."
4,Improvement over previous version of Label Factory,"This product works well for designing labels of all sorts. I've used the previous version of Label Factory and all my labels transferred over to Version 3.0. Also, 3.0 has an expanded set of clip art. Good product.Works with Vista."
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7 64 bit,"The manufacturer's website states it will work with Windows 7 32 & 64 bit (I have a new Windows 7 64 bit Dell computer). There is a patch there to make it Vista compatible, but nothing for Windows 7. I downloaded the Vista patch. The software stays open for 1 minute, then crashes, every time. This is the first legacy software program out of many I have installed that won't work on my machine. The interface looks like Windows 98 vintage stuff, not as good as the free Roxio program that came with my computer."
4,Easy to use,"I purchased this product to make various wedding labels. I was pleased with the final products and was surprised how easy they were to create. The only drawback I found was the quality of the clip art images. Although there are several images, some are not well designed. Also, there is a very limited amount of holiday clip art. Overall, this was a good choice and I will definitely be using it again and again."
4,Easy to use,"This product solved a problem for me, it was quick to set up, easy to use, and for those who need it has a neat spindle adapter to use with CD and DVD labels."
1,how??,"okay, half these reviews are anonymous, and so i am suspecting foul play- either that or the writer has enough sycophants to praise this trash.that's probably how it got published as well, because it's terrible! I'll avoid wasting any more of my time or breath on this- this thing. :("
1,Don't waste your money,This book is awful. The content is lack luster and boring from beginning to end. It covers the dot.com spectrum from A to B.
4,THE BIRTH OF COOKIE,"I look back rather fondly on these old Blondie films. Back growing up as a kid in the late 1960's and early 1970's they used to show them every weekend and i would watch them with my dad who had watched them himself in the theatres when he was just about my age back in the late 30's and 40's. I always found them hilarious, slapstick fun as a kid and while they don't pack quite the same punch today as they did back then they are still good fun.This film follows the events in ""Blondie Goes to College"" where we learned that Blondie was pregnant, In this film both of the bumbstead women...Blondie and Daisy the Dog, have puppies..err...I mean give birth. Blondie gives birth to the newest offspring Cookie, while Dagwood stumbles over himself trying to explai,n childbirth to Alexander. One of the funniest entries in the series filled with some wonderful slapstick. This episode is also sweet and heartwarming and highly anticipated back in the 1940's."
1,Not normal skateboard wheels,I ordered these and they definitaly aren't normal skateboard wheels. I've been skating for about ten years and there's no way I could use these in the park. Maybe for a begginer that wouldn't know the differnce they would work.. but not the normal skateboard wheels I've used all my life.
1,THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,At first I read some of the other reviews above or below and I thought that this prduct would be ok because there were only a couple reviews that were bad so I went ahead and bought them and WAS I WRONG. So I get them and I look at them carfully and they looked ok but as soon as I open them and actually feel them I noticed something differant. So I try and put the new bearings I also got and nothing. I try more force and still nothing so i look at the outline the bearings made and the bearings are to big. I also tryed several other bearings but nothing worked I also tryed scraping them on the ground and it already has a tiny flat spot. So that is it and I am very upset that this product did not work like it was supposed to I would have given this product a ZERO but I cant do that unfortunatly.
4,just as good as all the others,the only diference beetween blank wheels and the others is the pro models have the skaters name on it. so dont go bying 40 dollar whells cause they have cores or watever blank wheels are just the same and just as good
1,bearings do not fit,I orderd these wheels and they look great but there not I tried to put my bearings in and they will not GO IN.DO NOT BUY THESE
4,Decent wheels,"These wheels are really hard. They are probably 101 duro. I've been skating them for about 3 weeks and they haven't chunked and they have yet to start coning. The hardness of the wheels is great for the skatepark, but if your are strictly a street skater you might want to go with a softer wheel. The neon green is rad too. Chuch"
1,Horrible,"If you're thinking of buying these wheels,dont!.I just got these in the mail,and just found out that they wont fit any bearings for your board, search for some better wheels than these."
5,One of the best lesbian love stories I've ever come across,"I read this book in a day, and started it over again immediately afterward. Every detail of the story is expressed beautifully though subtly. I'd recommend this book to anyone."
3,"A tedious, albeit important classic","I wanted to catch up on my classics and this novel was definitely on the list. I found it to be kind of boring and tedious, although the glimpse through the historical window it provided was much appreciated. Very racy for it's time and certainly with believable, likeable characters, I would recommend it to others. It just really felt like a required school reading for me, which was unfortunate considering the importance of this book."
1,Terrible edition,"I was really disappointed with the quality of this edition. There were so many typos (both spelling and spacing). The edition seemed like a poorly-made, Kinkos copy. I highly recommend searching for a different version of this novel, if possible."
2,Plodding and dull,"Rather than looking forward to getting back in the evenings, I just got to a point where I decided I could not finish this book. I found it tedious, the character was not someone to whom I could relate. Just not for me."
5,Omg it's so hard to believe that this book is really this old. It's so fresh!,"Very good story. This is a romance, not erotica. It's really good but does NOT come with the ""history of lesbian pulp fiction ""as advertised."
3,Not proofread,"Somebody (there is no publisher is listed) has taken the original book and re-printed it...seemingly by re-typing it.There is a note that the 1952 copyright has expired and was not renewed, so I guess it's technically ""legal"".Nobody proof-read what they sent out, there are lots of errors.It is a classic book...soon to released as a movie, so this seems like a bit of a rip-off.But the story...as written by Patricia Highsmith is good."
4,Well written,"I have become thirsty for Patricia Highsmith's novels. I seems that no matter the subject she pulls the reader in. It's as if you become a character in the story. That is why i gave it 4 stars. It was interesting to see how homosexuality was viewed in the 1950s. One would never guess it now.This story left me feeling uneasy. ashamed for the characters. Depressed. I was amazed that Carol would give up her child for anyone period! In the long run, Carol will drown in the misery of her choice."
4,Great Book,This was an awesome book to pick up and put down. It is filled with historical information as well as a lot of anecdotes about the First Ladies of our country.
2,"Good pictures but too many mistake in name,places and map.","In general,this book is good for picture but can not use it for getting to know THAIS and THAILAND. I am ,Thai who live in America,very disappointed to see the book that represent my culture and heritage was not proof before published.for example,The picture on page 31 shown Wat Phra Kaew but the book said:""Grand Palace,Bangkok.This building houses The Giant Reclining Buddha"" instead of the Emerald Buddha.On page 87.""The traditional WAI greeting,performed at a dance festival."" We are Thai and never performed ""wai"" . More than that , 85% 0f the name of places, festival,locations,food,fruit,flower and map were wrong! Some picture was borrow from another source don't even get a credit. So,Thank for trying to do a good book about Thailand,but make sure to triple proof all information be fore it print."
4,Another Gentle Stevenson Romance,"Gerald and Elizabeth are brother and sister with no other surviving relatives, who find redemption and love with each other's help. While the book was written in the late sixties, it feels more like it's set in the twenties or thirties, when respectable people had servants and dressed for dinner. There's not a hint of the actual culture of 60's London, where much of the book is set. Nevertheless the book is extremely pleasant and absorbing."
5,Awesome Voice!,"This guy has got the richest most sincere voice in the history of male singers in my book. Sweet, sad and silly lyrics adorn all of these songs, and his voice just adds to the quality of the overall music. I definitely recommend this for those who enjoy oldies but goodies."
4,Jim Reeves,"Good compilation. However, on some of the numbers the background music practically covers Jim's great voice. I know strings were in at that time, which really dates the recordings, but somehow they could be toned down a bit. Altogether, a great addition to your collection."
5,Jim Reeves CD was a winner!,"This CD was a gift for my father, and he loved it. All of Jim's old classic country favorites with good sound quality. I was very satisfied."
3,Bought For My Dad,"I have not heard this cd..Thought my dad would be delighted.,,but I think he thought it outdated..It arrived fairly quickly.."
4,Sad but beautiful,This album had a nice quiet mood to it filled with songs that were often sad but very real. His voice caries the emotion of the words better than most. Great music to sing along with.
4,easy listening voice,did not know much about his history but really liked his voice when my Uncle would play his records----this is fine
5,JIM REEVES GREATEST HITS,WONDERFUL CD - I HAVE IT IN MY CAR AND I HAVE JIM REEVES SINGING AS I DRIVE TO AND FROM WORK. THIS CD IS A MUST-HAVE
5,A great suprise,I was thrilled when I found this for my daughter who is related to Jim Reeves - 4th Cousin. Nothing can compare to his voice and talent !
5,Delightful,"I have always loved Jim Reeves, it is very rare that when you purchase a cd that you enjoy every song on it. This time I was definitely not disappointed.thank you E Hutchinson"
2,"GREAT MUSIC FOR THE MOVIE, BUT REALLY BAD SOUNDTRACK","BUYER BEWARE!The ""soundtrack"" for The Spy Who Loved Me is not really a soundtrack at all, in my opinion. Many of the best music from the movie were left out, and we are left with sonic dogs like ""Mojave Club"" and ""Eastern Lights"". It does have its highlights like Bond 77 (even then, some of the best parts as it was heard in the movie was left out in the soundtrack), Ride to Atlantis, and a stunning instrumental version of ""Nobody Does It Better"" that just make you want to kick off your shoes, lay back and forget the ills of the world.However, the song as it appears in the movie was left out, as was the end credits, and many of the music in the movie's action scenes were also left out. Buy this now if you want to, but I would rather wait for an updated soundtrack..IF that ever comes.It is too bad, Marvin Hamlisch wrote one of the best scores for the Bond film, but the commercial soundtrack is one of the worst."
2,James Bond Re-Recorded,"Of all the James Bond soundtracks issued,""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is on the bottom of my list. I am not saying that the score heard in the film was bad. I am saying that this is not the score I heard in the film. I am not sure what it is. It is reminiscent of soundtracks issued during the 1950s where composers rearranged their film scores for commercial record albums.Composer, Marvin Hamlisch recorded the music in the film very well and seemed to be quite intuitive on what was required for different scenes. I believe that composers writing a Bond score are given great liberty to call upon previous musical cues from earlier entries in the series and write them into the score. It is very possible that Hamlisch was permitted to include only his original compositions for this album."
4,Not that bad,"One of the better non-Barry Bond-soundtracks.Hamlisch:s version of the Bond-theme is great,as is the pyramidmusic.A great album,well worth listening to."
3,pretty but quiet,This chime is pretty and simple but does not chime very often. The weight of the striker seems to take a lot of wind to get a sound. We like it's appearance.
5,great toaster,"I love this toaster. My husband likes his toast burned and I like mine one shade lighter than fawn. With the dual controls, I found the correct setting for both of us and I don't have to make any more adjustments. I don't mind the crumb trays in the back-just turn it around. I like the look-the red matches my quesadilla maker. Only tried the defrost and toast feature once for frozen hamburger buns. Had it set on 3 and they were a little browner than I wanted-will turn it down a notch or two next time."
3,"4-Slice Toaster, Could be better",I expected much more from this expensive toaster. The various settings do not produce the expected results and the toast or bagle is either over or under done.
5,Great Purchase,Got this to add to my husbands extensive Superman collection. He didn't have this particular version so it made a nice addition.
4,"Good Head, No Handle","This is a nice quality casting, the blades don't wear too fast and it is light enough to use for extended periods without exhaustion. It is great for breaking up hard soil in areas you can't get to with a roto tiller, or those small jobs like a narrow trench that are impossible with a large tiller.You do need to find a handle for it; Amazon does not have them. A standard hardwood that fits a ""No. 6 Eye"" works quite well."
2,one Mongolian guy's flute,"His flute playing is very nice with the oscillating flute sound, breathing in and out. Very authentic sounding, but very monotonous in my opinion. I think this would be more well-served mixed between some other Mongolian music tracks, like after a throat-singing song. I think it would be very nice with a morin khuur. The other review says its is meditative. It's nice relaxing music for opening your mail to or background music when you're doing some manual work. In my opinion the music is too monotonous and redundant and/or uneventful for my tastes to just listen to straight up--at least that's my opinion."
1,american propagandist,"This book will not give you much in the way of objective information or critique of the USIA. It is highly slanted (which is only to be expected considering the fact that it is written by a long-standing USIA employee) and glosses over the controversial role of propaganda both at home and abroad. However, it does contain very valuable, if unintended, insights into the thinking of propagandists. Green states in his introduction that Americans have a ""quaint and puritanical distaste"" for government propaganda. More than anything else, his arrogant derision of democratic processes (an attitude which is voiced throughout the book) serves as an accurate reflection of how propagandists think: citizens need to be ""massaged"" into accepting what's good for them. Green shares the philosophy of all propagandists - that the end justifies the means, even if honor is forsaken in the process. Save your money and get this book out of the library."
1,Cuisinart toaster CMT-400P,"I would have rated this product a ""0"" If there was a ""0"" there. It didn't last 30 days. I returned it as instructed in original box and packing to Cuisinart at my expence. 35 days later a recording tells me they never recieved it. Delivery confirmation informed me that they had indeed recieved it two weeks earlier. After talking with a ""live"" representive I was informed that a replacement would sent within 24 hours. Excuse-----Back orderd. I could not get a full refund. However I could get 50% of my cost back. I will never buy another product from Cuisinart nor will I recomend them to others."
1,Beautiful but useless!,"Loved the look. Prefect for my remodeled kitchen. But the toasting levers do not engage and therefore is a ""prop"" not a toaster. Sadly I will be sending it back. I am now looking for one that toasts as well as looking good."
2,2 Stars Only For Looks,"If your buying a toaster for looks but don't care how it toast, this may be what your looking for. Not one of the four slots can toast evenly, one side is done while the other hasn't browned at all. I expected much better performance for it's price. You are paying for the looks because this toaster is cheaply made. I've also tried a Dualit because I wanted a toaster that was made well, but I experienced the same outcome. I have come to the conclusion that the cheaper the toaster is, the better it toast."
3,I'm not sure about this one,"5 stars for looks, but straight out of the box I noticed something I didn't like. Following directions, I got the toaster ready for an element ""burn-off"" to get rid of those nasty smelling coatings. When I ""fired it up"" I noticed that there were a lot of gaps in the element ""ladders,"" and those gaps were not consistent on both sides. It doesn't appear to be by design, and it looks like uneven heating would result. For a toaster that normally costs about $200, I found this disquieting. I have just ordered a Krups 4-slice toaster to compare element continuity. I have had good luck with Krups products in the past. Stay tuned!"
2,Paying for the name ? Mais non!,"This is a retro-styled, HUGE toaster that doesn't do a better job than my older (not French, sorry) toaster. I do like the looks, although I really begrudge giving up any counterspace for it; and, of course, the metal shows every single fingerprint just like my stainless appliances do - yippee something else to polish on Saturday mornings :-( I also find one side of my toasted bread is always browner than the other and I have a lot of trouble with bagels. If I don't slice them exactly in half, the larger side will not fit in the toaster slots. I would recommend passing on this and looking for a similarly-styled, less expensive toaster."
2,Looks cool but has its drawbacks,"Our first problem with this cage is the constant escaping, we finally set up and watched to see how he was escaping. He gets on the slide and then is able to push enough to get the door open. We did solve this problem by bending the latch and making it harder to open.Second problem, The latch that holds the roof on broke, this wasn't much of a problem since the roof still stays in place with out it, but still..Third problem, the wheel.. One hamster liked to put bedding in it and it falls out the little holes and gets every where, another hamster liked to potty in there and of course it fell out the holes too and was VERY messy. I ended up taking off the wheel and slide.Fourth problem, you have to take the whole thing apart to clean it. Its frustrating, but you get good at putting it back together!But now after having it a year the top lid has broken and it will have to be replaced.On the bright side this cage looks cool has a lot of space. but has alot of draw backs."
4,Is the sequel out yet?,"It's great that Westlake/Stark revived the Parker books a few years back. Parker's the same, and still has Claire at the lake. Parker doesn't age, though he's been heisting since the '50s- I'm glad of that.This is good Parker but a little more convoluted than some earlier ones. The opening is right there with the best Parker of all time. Parker lets this job get a little more complicated than he likes, and the book ends with the hounds in pursuit, which means there must be a sequel coming. Stark has done this before, with Slayground followed by the very hard-to-find Butcher's Moon. I'm ready for the next one."
2,What happens next?,"I happen to be a fan of Westlake's, as himself and as Stark. However, I found this last book very disappointing. The character of the female bounty hunter is interesting, but then she suddenly disappears, even though it is suggested she is on a track. On the other hand, we find out more than we need to know about what happens to another character, Dr. Madchen, even though he is almost peripheral to the story. At the end, the hero is last seen climbing a hill, with dogs and cops in pursuit. I suppose that explains the title.On his own website, Westlake says ""the only thing wrong with the ending is that it suggests the end of a series"". I suppose authors love even their misses. I hope he redeeems himself next time."
5,The series has never been better,"Westlake is still going strong. This latest Parker volume begins like the Parker books of 40 years ago. The ultra-dry style of the Stark books aren't for everyone--there may not be an extraneous word in any of the 25 Parker books. A true-to-life ""partial holocaust"" at the conclusion of ""Nobody Runs Forever"" is fully in the Stark tradition."
2,Nobody Runs Forever,"This was a pretty good crime novel. It kept my interest and the characters were well defined. However, throughout the book there were typos, mostly misaligned words and punctuation. I imagine this was a problem in the adaptation for Kindle. I wasn't going to say anything until I noticed a missing passage towards the end of the book. I am new to the kindle and hope this isn't going to be a common problem. For the price of these books we should be getting a better edited product."
2,A crappy sequal to a good game,"Allied Assault was a great game. Fun missions and good gameplay. Graphics were pretty good for its time. Spearhead was going downhill but still enjoyable. Breakthrough however, is utter crap. No graphic improvement, minimal weapon improvement, and it still seems like one man is defeating the whole Axis army. Call of Duty is a much better investment."
3,"OK, not as good as original","Disappointed with this one, the first MOH was great and got me into all these WWII games (Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc..). But something was missing from this? Hope this helps!"
4,"Blondie says ""...we must put the world in order!""","Everything is here in this 12th BLONDIE film, the sneak preview, the familar postman with the ""air-mail"" and the nice tune, ""funny-face, funny-hat"". The new baby, ""Cookie"" (Majelle White) is now settled at home. Cookie has a babysitter (Renie Riano) that falls asleep and snores. Blondie (Penny Singleton) begins a new women's group. ""Now that we housewives have put our houses in order, we must help to put the world in order"". Also, Blondie needs a dummy, so she practices first aid on Dagwood (Arthur Lake). Alexander (Larry Simms) and Alvin (Danny Mummert) are busy helping with the war too. They find Dagwood's diary. This film is in honor of all women and housewives too. The next film in the series is IT'S A GREAT LIFE (1943)"
4,Lovely book and good story,"Bought this for my grandson, 6 yrs. He is not so interested in the story as he is in the pictures. Maybe when he is a little older and can read it for himself."
3,Good Work...But not what I was expecting..,"This album is fair weather but not horrible. But honestly, its not what I expected. There are far too many cameos, and also, many of the songs leave you with no impression after listening to them. The stand-outs include the killer Intro and Outro (Is it me but arent ALL of her Intros and Outros the best ever heard), He Makes Me Say, Apartment For Rent, Leave Me Alone, and Phone Sex. I also like Suddenly but Im not a big Common fan, so I change it when he comes in. Her first album is still her best to me....She sounds fine on Chapter 3, I just dont really care for the material itself."
4,Chapter 3 The Flesh,"First I love her voice so Soulful and Another Relationship is a winner. I'm giving Syleena 4 stars take away a star for the Phone Sex song w/Twista the rest of the cd is great, I would like to see Ms. Johnson work with better producer to really showcase that so so soulful voice. Take up should be Chapter 4 Live"
3,Sadly Disappointed,"Being a fan of Syleena Johnson since the very beginning I had high expectations.After a few listens I was shocked, this isn't the Syleena Johnson i knew and loved. I've heard sellout and other terrible things but surely not Syleena? Right?Sadly this CD sounds like any other forgettable R&B; that is produced by large corporations who really don't care about music over what sells.Her voice has grown and matured with age and sounds incredible as always and that alone is worthy of 3 stars, now all she needs is some songs that actually show off her talent instead of mask it.Buy Chapter 2: The Voice, its an incredible CD that showcases her amazing voice and wide range.Avoid this CD unless you are a die hard fan and can't live without it and even then you will be left wanting as I was."
4,"Come on People, Where is the Love?","This woman is the most under appreciated,under rated R&B; vocalists of our time. She has a combination of Tina Turner's raw, throaty vocal style, Aretha's soulful ""from the gut"" powerhouse vocals, and Whitney's ""keep it real sass"".Although,Syleena went off the radar (and the Billboard charts) with songs like ""Apartment for Rent"", Bulls'Eye, and Classic Love Song. She more than makes up for those mistakes with ""Hypnotic, Special Occasion-(Which would've been a classic if she didn't have R. Kelly on it),""Slowly"", Still Open,""Time"", and my personal favorite-""Another Relationship"".I even like ""The Flesh"" interlude and outro.If you have any of her previous albums, you already know.I'm personally campaigning to put Syleena Johnson back on the Charts, go get this album, and if you don't have Chapters 1 and 2, go get them too!"
4,The Baddest chick in Da Game&Sexy to my eyes,"I've always dug Me some Syleena Johnson since Her first Album.Her range is soulful as all get up.She reminds me of a Modern Day Randy Crawford.I dig some Artists that are vastly Underrated,but bring it at any time.my cuts on here are ""Hypnotic"",&My Jam of the Moment ""Special Occasion"" with the King of Music R.Kelly.stepping always feels so Good yes In Double Deedy.""Still Open is tight&the Flesh ludes are tight.Her Voice blows away all these Neo-soul Singers&alot of these Bums Playing on Tv with a Microphone but there mouths never fully open.Syleena Johnson is a thick Juicy Momma as well.I luvs Her Talent&she is Happening on my eye balls az well.She has been slept on far too long."
2,The Flesh is weak,"I think all of these five-star reviews are for Syleena herself and not for this album. I know that she's the real deal, underrated and yada yada yada but it seems like she's selling out here. She shed her clothes and is now singing more sexually explicit songs like ""Phone Sex"" and ""Slowly"". And when she's not doing that, the results aren't much better. The songwriting seems uninspired, Syleena sounds like she doesn't want to sing them and there are too many unnecessary guest stars. ""Apartment for Rent"" and ""He Makes Me Say"" are the only reasons why I didn't take this album back."
1,Legendary Rip Off,"I bought this DVD for my father in law who grew up watching ""Bat Masterson"" as a child, along with ""Great Western TV Shows Collection"" from the same era. Imagine my frustration when the same two episodes from the ""Bat Masterson"" TV series featured on both DVD's. It is extremely irresponsible of Amazon not to detail the epsiode content of their merchandise. To add insult to injury I have to pay for the return shipment. All this before the quality of the recording has been reviewed."
2,Did we really accept such stuff?,"I'm glad I didn't buy the series, as the quality is shockingly fuzzy. I can't believe it was so bad when originally broadcast: it must have suffered from poor storage surely. But at the cheap price, is worth buying just for the theme tune! And perhaps to see just how callow we were to watch such series all those years ago."
2,Legendary Lawmen,"This item was OK. It arrived quickly. I wish this item were close-captioned. I realize it is old, nevertheless, I still wish it were captioned. Love Gene Barry."
4,A suprise,"Never had heard of this movie, so I was surprised that it was as good as it was. Tommy Lee Jones makes everything good."
4,Interesting,"interesting , reminds me of not country for old men gives you feel old south and new southentertaining from my view"
4,good time,I enjoy this film each time I watch it. I like the Louisiana feel. James Lee Burke's books are always looked forward to.
4,love Tommy Lee Jones in anything,"Just a darn good movie.. keeps you watching... the first movie i have streamed it was easy and fun, i'll stream again."
5,Loved it!,A great book by James Lee Burke and the movie was just as good! I especially enjoy all his Dave Robicheau [sp?] novels -- wish there were more movies like this one.
3,"Great actors, slow pace","Tommy Lee Jones is always great ... but this movie didn't live up to his full talents. Still enjoyed the story, but it dragged in the middle."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"This movie has a terrific cast! Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors and I was really looking forward to this, but I quickly saw why all the big companies past on it and why it went direct to video. The story was bland, rushed, and predictable."
2,Tommy Lee Jones is the only reason to watch this,"UGH, kinda interesting, but slow and strange pace to the movie. Little hard to follow. Love Tommy Lee and John Goodman, but other than that, not worth the time."
4,REALLY ENJOYED,"We wish that this film had been released in our market. I am sure that we would have enjoyed it even more on the big screen. I found it to be it well cast, and filmed. Highly recommend."
2,Really surprised at how they portayed Dave,Not what I thought Dave Robicheaux would be like after reading many of the books. Rather disappointed as II really like Tommy Lee Jones in most things I've seen him in.
2,Very slow,Found the movie to be very slow so much so that I fell asleep watching it. I like Tommie Lee Jones but was disappointed in this movie.
3,Soft storyline but definitely not a snoozer!,"A downright good movie! Tommy Lee Jones needs some new boots tho, quite the limp he has! Not a blockbuster but for sure a nice way to spend ""me"" time."
2,the big snoozy,this movie is fantastic if you suffer from chronic insomnia and are desperate for a non-addictive sleep aid. i've attempted to watch it twice. it's so bad i forgot i saw it and that's the only reason there was a 2nd attempt. didn't bother to finish it either time as far as i can remember. zzzzzzz
4,Electric Mist,"Good cast, but not the best. They needed a worthy bad guy in mold of Legion Guidry from another novel Burke wrote."
1,Steaming pile of garbage.,"It was a challenge forcing myself to see it through to the end. Before you think some of the bad reviews here ""just don't get it."" Let me warn you. This movie is not clever, creative, complex, French or any of the other things that may inspire such mixed reviews. It's just plain boring. Nothing happens. I am utterly befuddled at all the comments lauding the great acting. Jones was fine but some of the supporting and secondary cast sounded like they were reading cue cards. Just awful."
3,IT WAS OK,"Tommy Lee Jones is a Sheriff hes looking for the murderer of a prostitute, it has a ok story line and the characters keep you just Interested enough to stick with it, it was an Ok Flick"
2,ppppth,"Great cast, poor movie. Extremely slow paced. I have not read the books but might after reading other reviews. I can imagine that this dud of a movie might have begun its life as a good book...But seriously, this movie has nothing to recommend it."
2,Only For Hard Core Robicheaux Fans,"I was looking forward to the release of this movie, since I am a big fan of Mr. Burke and his Robicheaux series. This movie may have had a fighting chance if it was about an hour longer. But, as released in the U.S., the movie seems like a crudely slapped together collection of short excerpts from what the real movie should have been. Tommy Lee Jones basically plays himself and the other big name characters are not given enough script to develop their characters. Actually, given the large number of characters in the story, and the multiple story lines, this may not have been the best Burke novel to bring to the screen. A real disappointment."
1,Read the Book,"In the Electric Mist With Conferate Dead was the first novel I had ever read by James Lee Burke and I immediately became a fan. When I heard that a movie version was in production and starring Tommy Lee Jones as Burke's protagonist Dave Roubiceaux, I assumed that it would be a box office hit and a classic movie. Not so. The fact that it was released directly to DVD surprised me but curiousity made me go ahead and buy it through Amazon. Unless you've read the book first, save your money. I found this movie to be a confusing mess of a great novel. Burke's writing is poetic but you'd never guess it by watching this movie. A major disappointment."
2,Electric Mist,"Purchased for a friend of mine. The movie was in excellent condition as promised, she did not like the movie though."
2,Find another moview,"Great actors but bad unbelievable story-line. Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor, and has had some great movies, but his age shows in this one. I watched the whole movie but wouldn't do it again."
5,Electric Mist,"This is a really good movie. You can feel the heat and sultriness of South Louisiana. Since I do like Alec Baldwin as Dave Robicheaux in ""Heaven's Prisoners"", I wasn't sure that I would like Tommy Lee Jones as Dave, but he was outstanding. Tommy is a terrific actor who gets better with age. He fits the Robichaux character to a Tee.Also, the movie follows the book by James Lee Burke and the story is outstanding.The filming and scenery is beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery, and/or enjoys the South.I bought this movie from Amazon.com and the service was great."
4,CRIME IN THE BIG BAYOU,"Based on the crime novels of James Lee Burke. Tale follows a P.I. in the bayous of Louisiana shortly after Katrina laid waste to the area. The rich atmosphere is truly evoked. I particularly enjoyed the sparring and history between the characters played by Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman. The tale was overly introspective and may turn some people off according to those who read the books. Personally, I found it to be a nice change from the typical movies tossed out by Hollywood. Interesting visit from Confederate General Hood. Ned Beatty has a supporting role in this film. I haven't read the novels but I plan to look them up really soon. WHEN WATCHED: MAY 2010; MY GRADE: B (B minus if you aren't partial to the style or setting)."
3,"great book, ok movie","But it never took off. No real misdirection. The mystery was solved straight ahead, with no doubt. The relationship with Dave's wife never had a spark of real feeling in this movie. Two fine actors, couldn't get it done. A lot must have been left on the cutting room floor."
2,A shame,"Why do filmmakers destroy a great book? A terrible movie, great acting but a crap movie. Poorly edited, choppy, no atmosphere, NO CLETE, harly a ghost, charecter development was sadly lacking. Was Bootsie there? Or Batiste? Not nearly as much as in the books. Read the book, forget the movie. I feel real bad for what they did to your fine book Mr.Burke.a shame."
4,Very good.,Well acted. Confusing ending but enjoyed getting there. The visuals were beautiful and the dialog sharp. How many more words do I need?
3,This one is a bit too predictable ...,Love Tommy Lee and John but this show is slow going and predictable. It has entertainment value however be prepared you'll have the urge to fast foward just to get things moving.
2,Boooooring,Slow development. Paper thin characters and just as thin execution. Tommy Lee Jones might as well have been in a one man play and it probably would have been better.
4,Tommy Lee Jones has a good feel for Streak,"I preferred Jones' portrayal of Dave Robicheaux relative to Baldwin's. He knows the subtleties of a southern man. The cast in general is good and the adaptation doesn't stray far and is well directed. If you are a fan of James Lee Burke, you will probably enjoy this movie.If you don't now of Burke's work, but enjoy a flawed protagonist, colorful characters, connected criminals and Louisianan idiosyncrasies, you might enjoy this movie, give it a try while it is available on Prime and you could become a fan."
3,Tommy Lee Jones is good .,It Probably reads better as a book then it plays as a movie . Although it held my interest I found it to be a bit slow . It reminds me of the Jessie Stone series of movies .
5,Loved it,Tommy Lee Jones great as always. Louisiana a great backdrop for a great mystery. Keeps you on the edge of your seat
4,Interesting and entertaining,Tommy Lee Jones turns in his usual great performance. The setting for the story (south Louisiana)is a personal favorite. If highly recommend this movie.
3,"Fairly Good, but Overly Complicated and Cloying","Tommy Lee Jones tracks a serial killer preying on young women; at the same time he's also thinking about a 40-year-old killing of a black escapee. Ultimately, the two are traced to the same source.The movie was interesting at first, but suffers from a few inexplicable 'plotholes,' being overly complex, playing up Jones' non-racist background, and unrealistic levels (for today) of blacks fear of cooperating with police investigations. Somehow Hurricane Katrina gets dragged into the plot as well."
2,Lame...,"Somewhere there was a huge disconnect between the novel and the film, and the film falls far short. I have read in these posts that the director lost control to the studio during post-production, so maybe that's the reason. Read the book instead..."
2,Don't waste your time,"All I can say is it is typical Tommy Lee Jones, this movie is boring with waste-of-time filler. I was very disappointed."
1,boring,This movie did not go anywhere. It held my attention but never got to the point. I want my 2 hours back.
2,In the Electric Mist,"In The Electric MistI like John Goodman but he was miscast as a villain. Tommy Lee Jones' character was not likeable when he wasn'troughing up people, he was talking to ghosts."
1,A waste of your valuable time!,"I watched it expecting some exciting twist in the plot all the way till the end....just to be let down. This is not a typical Tommy Lee Jones' movie. This movie had an attractive star lineup, with a story situated in Lousiana's Bayou - all elements that make one to expect a quality movie. But, not this one.This movie revolves around a sheriff who is in search of a serial killer that goes around killing young women in Lousiana. There is no plot per se: The sheriff just goes around beats up people to get clues. Also, a civil war era general mysteriously appears to give sound advice to the sheriff from time to time.You are better off spending your time on some other B grade movie."
1,The Electric Mist,We were unable to watch this on streaming. It kept reloading. Went onto Netflix to watch it. The movie name was The Electric Mist.
3,Do you ever watch a movie and wonder... What the hell did I watch?,"Well, that is kind of what I felt when I watched this movie without any context. I know know that there is a series of books that this movie is related to and had I known that I might have read some of them beforehand! But, with that said and with no other reference this movie just feels like a cheap action flick with some mixed up drama. The plot just seems so shallow and a lot of the deeper concepts are unexplained."
3,"Quite good, much like Jesse Stone films","This film was very entertaining. Corn pone humor-like, but good-natured.I recommend this film to fans of the Jesse Stone books and films. It's got a similar local sensibility and sensitivity.Some violence; I suppose that's endemic to Louisiana. Good nonetheless. Watch it, if for nothing other than Tommy Lee Jones, Mary Steenburgen, and John Goodman."
2,"Ok, but a little boring","Just really could not get into the movie very much, yet at first the story did seem a little interesting but was kind of bored some throughout the film and was confused at times to what was going on. Maybe if your a fan of Tommy Lee Jones then you could enjoy it, but would not call this one of his better pictures.Peter J. Miller"
2,dissapointed in delivery,"Very good cast, good backdrops, poor dialog delivery, poor story lines, moderate direction. Disappointed in this low budget, filmed in a weekend, delivery."
1,Buyers beware,Buyers beware...This american release of Bertrand Taverniers IN THE ELECTRIC MIST is not thecut favored by the French director but a producers cut which makes a total mess of the story and which is some 15 minutes shorter than the 117 minute director's cut recently presented at the Berlin Film Festival!Jean-Pierre ThilgesFilm critic
4,good drama,"this was a good drama, tommy lee jones dont make any bad movies, at least i havent see any. i like the ending, nice twist."
4,Surprise!,"This movie took me by surprise. To me, the developed characters of any movie are as equally significant as the story. I rate this movie four star as it excels at both. It had the element I give a fifth star for.. (A compelling story that you can relate to so well to that it draws you in),but it was too slow implementing it."
3,Good movie,pretty well done. Somewhat disjointed but that is the nature of the story line. Dave is a flawed man and the movie does well in bringing that out
3,Enjoyable,I am a fan of Tommy Lee Jone. I decided to watch this movie because it was filmed in Louisiana. I am glad I did watch.
3,A few lame touches mar this,"This one was straight to DVD, despite the big name cast, and I can sort of see why. Moments of the acting are a bit amateurish, even including most of the otherwise great John Goodman's take on a New Orleans mobster. Tommy Lee Jones, as the alcoholic sheriff, has played that role at least a dozen times, and he gets it pretty right. The weird dream scenes with Levon Helm as the Confederate general should have been left on the cutting room floor. Not that Helm is bad. He looks the part. It's just that we don't need that interrupting the flow. We also don't need the voiceovers by the sheriff. I guess this was based on a novel series I haven't read. It does smack a bit of an Elmore Leonard movie, most of which don't work very well either. This is not bad, but it's far from great."
2,In the Electric Mist(Blue-ray),Do not know why I didn't like this movie...but maybe I didn't understand the story line. Hope others enjoyed it.
3,poorly cast,"I have read most of the james lee burke novels and obviously a fan. I am somewhat disappointed with the movie version of electric mist because it came off as a highly condenced poorly connected verson of the original story. It did hit the high points but did not develop the underlying structure that the book reveals. One of the repeat characters in burke's books is clete purcell. Clete is a loose cannon and is always the center of some sort of mayhem when he appears in the book. If he had been given the time instead of what appeared to be a fifteen second ""spot"" john goodman would be perfect for the character.Although I like tommy lee, he does not convey the robicheaux persona that exists in burke's books. Dave is like a pot about to boil most of the time and although there is violence generated by tlj he does not convey the physical intimidation factor that is always there with robicheaux. Bruce willis carries this persona.Levon helm does a great job as the general."
3,In the Electric Mist,"This movie does capture a lot of James Lee Burke's characters but misses a lot at the same time. Tommy Lee Jones is right out of the book but that is as far as it goes, I actually thought Heaven's Prisoner's made it to the big screen better because the supporting characters around Alex Baldwin were developed so well with the exception of Eric Roberts who was a little over the edge. When you read his books you are sitting in your living room swatting mosquitoes and and wiping the sweat from your neck and if the could have intermingled these two movies it would have been idyllic. But, anything that Burke wrote that makes it into a movies is worth watching."
3,Disappointing Adaptation,"Great cast, bad story editing. The writers/studio kept in most of the major plot points from the novel and sacrificed characterization and motivation (and believable solutions to crimes) to keep the movie under 2 hours. Big mistake. Important characters remain one-dimensional, ancillary crimes remain unsolved and--by the writers/filmmakers, at least--forgotten, and the lead character, Robicheaux, exists on two planes: violence and cynicism. In the novel, the characters are fully realized, interesting, believable. But every character in this movie--through no fault of the actors--seems little more than a plot device. Watching this movie, you get the feeling that at some point it was an excellent three hour movie, but that studio suits got hold of it and bled it out. Someone needs to tell them that you can't fit an entire novel into a 100 minute movie. You'd think that would be obvious by now."
3,In the Electric Mist,"Tommy Lee Jones is well suited to the role of a detective tracking down grisly murderers in the Bayou. Confederate ghosts haunt him as he searches for answers not only to the prostitues being murdered currently, but the forty year old case that he dredges up as well. Pacing is not fast but at a even tempo that keeps your interest throughout. Good casting for all the support roles with special nods to John Goodman, Ned Beatty, and Mary Steemburgen. If you enjoy murder mysteries I suggest you at least rent this one. Good quality picture and sound with some great scenery in the New Orleans area post Katrina. Decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catchIn the Valley of Elah.CA Luster"
3,the modern south comes alive,"Tommy Lee Jones is an old school small town policeman.When young women start showing up dead and badly cut up,he has to investigate. A murder that he witnessed 40 years before plays a partand he seems to have a time travel episode whenit seems like the case is going no where,He meets a famous southern general who gives him fatherly advice,which comes to think is his mind playing bad tricks on him.The resulting movie is well made and keeps your attention,but might not be very popular with a modern audienceas the plot forces you to thinkabout the system that still rules in the south."
4,Great Movie,Enjoyed this movie. I had never seen it before. Tommy Lee Jones has always been a favorite of mine. Lots of twists and turns in the story line. Would recommend this to anyone!
5,great movie,very good movoe. tommy lee jones great. also enjoyed mary steenburgen and john goodman performances. good story line and plot twists
2,horrible,horrible acting. horrible editing. horrible dialoge. horrible pacing. boring with way too much driving and talking.only actor good in movie is woman scraping grill who is in movie for only a minute.
1,Do ANYTHING but watch this sleeper.,What a bad script. What bad acting from many of the non-stars. What a bad editing job. I see why this was never released in theaters; patrons would want their money back. Go watch TV. It HAS to be better.
1,Buyer beware!!,This CD is a techno album. It does not in any way feature Boston's Dropkick Murphys. Don't get fooled like I did.
4,"A strange, delightful collection of mini-fictions","This is a wonderfully odd little collection of half things. The delightful instruction manuals, the weird family recollections, everything he writes about comes out of this wonderfully playful style. I kind of wish some of these would have sustained for a bit longer, just to how he would have developed them, but Cortazar is able to weave his usual stylistic charm even with fictions that are just a paragraph long. A short, easy read."
3,A unique perspective on the myth,"In ATLANTIS: DWELLING PLACE OF THE GODS (1976), Mertz employs some of the then latest advances in geology and finds in North American archeology to argue that the ""island"" of Atlantis was located in the southeastern United States (see cover above) and that the Atlanteans were the native American mound builders (as well as copper miners and traders), whose advanced civilization was destroyed by an earthquake and subsequent tidal wave that occurred about 1200 BC. She also includes some discussion of the mythical Antillia, a putative eighth-century settlement associated with Spanish and Portuguese presence in pre-Columbian and post-Columbian North America, but, as they occurred centuries after Atlantis is said to have fallen, the inclusion of these expeditions generally detract from her central thesis."
4,Too many calories!,"Do you know how many calories are in a pack of Reese's Cups? Too many!!! I had a Reese's Cup the other day and I had to go to the gym afterwards to burn it off. It's a good thing that I'm cheap and that I buy Reese's Cups when they're on sale for 25 cents, which isn't often. Don't let the sweet taste of chocolate and peanut butter fool you! You'll be fat before you know it!"
1,Got the Wrong Thing,"I received Casbah Hummus Mix instead of the Lemon Spinach Couscous I had ordered. I'm not quite sure how this happened, because the box said ""Hummus"" all over it, except for one little sticker that said Lemon Spinach Couscous... Tried the Hummus & I don't like it very much. But, if you add the juice from one lemon, some seasonings, and olive oil, then it tastes OK."
3,Its ok,Its ok if you like leftovers I guess. But to say this is SF best album is a joke. Art of Balance has crushing drums and guitars this one sounds like it was made in an hour. Even of one blood is better.
5,best album,Im a fan of shadows fall im let me tell you this is the best album they had done.songs like winter shows how great this band are.this album even that is a B side material is much better that war within. buy this album
5,SHADOWS FALL ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the greatest metal albums that I have heard. Shadows Fall is a excellent band. I think it is better that The War Within, The Art of Balance, and Of One Blood. Please pick this one up, you will like it."
5,An excellent sequel!,"Hambly continues Joanna's story with this book and continues to develope her cast of personalities. All the books in this trilogy stand alone, but, again, once you start you want them all. One can but hope that she will""make more""!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Back again, and more problems.Having made it back to her own Earth, our heroine still doesn't have it a lot easier - but does have electricity and running water. There's still evil wizards that want to rule the world, live forever, and generally do bad things.The good wizard she fancies she has shafted, and somehow has to try and set that right. Her only advantage? A modern outlook and some technology."
1,"Book great, but TONS of typos","The book is fabulous, like most everything Hambly writes.But this electronic edition is chock full of typos - specifically, pairs of words that are run together. On average, there's a typo per page - and I'm talking about on an iPhone! The typos are very distracting. I wrote the publisher and had no response, so I guess they've got my money and don't care. I'll be writing Amazon to see about getting it fixed, because it's a really great book and I prefer to buy things in Kindle format these days."
2,RUSSELL CROWE,"Although a good film, I just cannot show this newly purchased DVD to girlfriends or buddies. Living in the American ""biblebelt,"" my first showing of HAMMERS OVER THE ANVIL got a very negative reaction.As a big fan of Russell Crowe, I bought this film the minute it was released on DVD. I was surprized the opening sequence was him frolicking nude with a bunch of horses. After viewing the film,I realized that scene was important to the character development of the role he was playing. However, to the casual viewer, it appears as a ""homoerotic"" beginning sequence to an otherwise ""straight"" movie."
4,touching story about growing up,"The youth's need of role models. Very good acting, an unusual story with rare characters."
4,Russell at his best.,"This movies was one of Russell Crowes best movies, probably next after Beautiful Mind. The scenery and the horses were very Australian and he was brilliant as usual."
2,Slow but well-acted,"Polio-stricken youngster Alan Marshall (Alexander Outhred) hero-worships the local horseman and blacksmith, East Driscoll (Russell Crowe) in the early 1900s in the Australian Outback. When East has an illicit affair with a married woman (Charlotte Rampling), Alan has a hard time reconciling his admiration of the man with his distaste for his actions. Horses are only a backdrop, but there are some nicely done equestrian and wildlife scenes. Based on the memoirs of Alan Marshall.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,"You can slow the passage of time, just watch this movie.","Not only was the main character coming of age, I felt myself getting old as the minutes dragged by. My wife and I were ahaking our watches about halfway through.Nothing worth seeing ever happens. The sorely needed redemption never comes.These people need to stay home more.If you already have rented the video, just watch your pizza or the news or golf.Don]t say you were not warned."
1,A weak effort...,"Sadly, I will never get the hour and a half back that I wasted watching this film. It was though someone decided to see how many people they could get to watch their film just by putting Russell Crowe in it. The dialogue was so garbled that you practically need subtitles to understand the words. The plot never really delved into the characters, it just glossed over them as if it were a tale for slow witted children. If you are expecting the usual Crowe charm, there is none at all! Plus he has a truly dismal hair cut! The only reason that I gave it one star is for the first sequence...all I can say is that horse hair does not belong in some crevices of the human body!"
2,Wobbly handle,"I love the look of this kettle, but the handle is hinged to the body, and when I pour from it the kettle swings back and forth dangerously; I've burned myself a couple of times. It's a shame that such care was taken with the aesthetics when the functional design is so poor."
1,Teakettle Broke,"Soon after I received this teakettle, the handle broke off. Amazon wouldn't give me a refund, so now I have to file a claim with my credit card company. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Not Equal to the Original,"I have used the original product through friends for a number of years. This product is flimsy by comparison. It has not held up well. I do not not know the gauge of the original metal, but it is considerably stronger. In just a short period of use the vertical piece by which the handle attaches to the kettle top has loosened, and it does not appear that it can be repaired except by taking it to a welder. It is usable as is, but neither substanial nor pleasing."
1,HANDLE IS TOO HOT TO HANDLE.,"This is a great looking teapot, but the handle is a problem. It does not stay upright. It gets very hot, since it lays on top of the pot while the water boils and heats the plastic handle in the process."
3,Completists only,"I bought this to complete my set of The Enid and all-conntected. Sadly track 4 doesn't play, being limited to 2 seconds only. the album is good musically but has disappointing songs with uninspiring lyrics"
5,The best watch that I have ever had,"I received this watch a year ago, as a gift, and I love it. It keeps accurate time, and is the most attractive watch I have owned. I did have to replace the battery, and the store (Jarad's), had to return it to the factory for replacement. It took almost a month to get it back. I still would recommend it to anyone, and I concur with the five star rating."
4,response to shaky,"I have the book and did not find the word ""removed."" I did find on page 79 ""One of the so-called errors of the Western Church was the addition of the words 'and from the Son' (Filioque in Latin)..."" Rev. Lovasik says the Council of Canstantinole(381) left the matter opened and the Eastern Church preferred ""through"" not ""from"" the Son. I hope Shaky will give the page for the ""removed"" comment and give the book a second chance."
3,Shaky,"While I've only browsed through the book, and not bought it, my reason for not doing so illustrate my reason for not doing so.In recounting the history of the Great Schism of 1054, Fr Lovasik states that the Greeks had *removed* the filioque clause from the Nicene Creed.In fact, the filioque was not originally part of the Creed, first having been added in 534 at a council in Toledo, the purpose being to combat Islam. The addition was initially opposed by the Roman See, but eventually (8th or 9th century) added, but only in the west. The Eastern Churches rejected, and, for the most part, continue to reject, this addition. Those in communion with Rome, however, regard it as a valid, but non-binding, statement of faith.Having seen this error in reporting one of the pivotal moments in the Church's history, I found it impossible to consider reading the rest of the book."
5,Bellydance for Beginners: Arms & Abs,This workout will really tone you upper boddy. Its fun and not too intense although for a beginner it may take you a couple of weeks or so to hold the abdominal strengthening positions. But it does work.
1,"Horrible, Do not buy this","I was so dissapointed when I bought these. I was looking for a supplement to my class. I have been dancing 8 months. They hardly even did any bellydance moves, it was mostly sit-ups, there are a lot of better ways in bellydancing to work your abs than sit-ups. Unless you are really old,or really out-of shape do not buy this, try Shamira's tape instead, I just bought that and was very happy wiht it."
4,Very decieving!,I started out on this and it was easy...but as time went through..by the end of the half hour I was in pain!! If this doesnt make me loose nothign will!
3,Nice holster,"Not a fan of the tensioners. On my Ruger SR1911, It doesn't fit all that well. The trigger guard bangs up against the top tensioner..."
3,Conceal carry?,"This is a very well made holster, it holds the weapon firmly and covers the trigger. However it is not a good choice for conceal carry even with a coat covering the weapon, it tends to push the handgun away from the body. The Galco Jak Slide Belt Holster would be a better choice for those that want this type of holster and do not want to carry inside the waistband."
3,A very old classic,"In Einstein's day this might have been a very good read! It is very well written. It is like reading a Spanish concurrent to Russell. A little reading finds it is a translation of a 1912 text. With general Relativity being a product of the understanding of the velocity based non Euclidean geometry of Lorentz who based his work on Poincare who based his work on Klein who based his work on... you see that history is important in an axiomatic development like this has been! But for a modern student of geometry, this book is much like buying a copy of Euclid's book on geometry: a reference that might help with understanding, but is so far out of date that it can be very little help in current problem!"
3,Uninspiring,"I had one of these for about a year. I own lots of Dewalt cordless tools, and have been generally very happy with them. I use the heck out of my standard 12v drill, so this right-angle drill seemed like a natural addition. I found the body to be pretty large and clumsy, which kind of defeats the idea of getting something for working in confined spots. Because it was hard to hold and manipulate, I had a hard time driving screws without slipping the bit out of the head frequently. After a while, I just gave up on using this and found other ways to get the work done. (If you're interested, I have used a Milwaukee corded ""close quarters"" drill and really like it.)"
2,Eh...mostly forgettable,"I've never had any crushing biases against ""boy bands"". It's just that...well, there's a reason most of them are flashes in the pan, and Schubert Dip is a classic example. Unbelievable, of course, is the big selling point; the rest of album is mostly bland and forgettable. There just isn't any variety or creativity here. Of course, it doesn't help that the singer has a *really* limited vocal range; okay for Unbelievable, doom for an entire album. Ultimately, Schubert Dip is a typical by-the-numbers potboiler that's...well, mostly forgettable."
2,Dated Alt Pop,"EMF are the schlock pop hooligans responsible for the catchy `Unbelievable'. I suppose that if you must have that little curio there is nothing for it, but believe me, that is all EMF ever did. I still remember the big controversy over what their name meant, of course, nowadays no one even remembers their name."
1,One hit wonder,This cd has only one good song. The rest of the cd seems boring and uneventful. The other songs aren't as good as their one hit song and really don't remind me of their hit.
1,ick,"I've only heard 'unbelieveable' and it's got an awesome beat to it. But the lyrics make absolutely zero sense. It seems they didn't even pay attention to what they were writing, all they wanted to do was play their guitars and scream the f-word literally about 50 times. blech."
1,"Hey we have a hit, guess we need an album","This entire album was written with one thing in mind. Sell records. The ""unbelievable"" song was a sudden hit and the boys had 3 weeks to crank out this horrible attempt at music. In all honesty the music itself isnt bad but the lyrics and vocals are downright awful. Theres a good reason why these guys were flashes in the pan."
2,Good For A Few Songs,"This album is alright, although its certainly nothing great or ground-breaking. The first half especially is bland and sounds like the lesser material that was released in the late 80's/early 90's era. Then the second half kicks off with the hit single ""Unbelievable"" which is of course the song that made us buy this album in the first place. The next few songs aren't quite so catchy in comparison, but they offer up some pretty nice synth chords delivered in accordance to the mid-tempo dance beat that resonates throughout most of this release. Now the last song, ""Longtime"" is nothing short of a hidden gem. It took me a few listenings to discover it, but now I like it much better than the famous, yet overplayed aforementioned hit. This song has the best sounding vocals and an excellent synth hook! If you're willing to buy a rather sub-par album for a few really great songs, be sure to listen for it!"
3,BUBBLY DANCE POP,"The initials stand for Epsom Mad Funker (if you can believe them). Besides their debut single Unbelievable, other bubbly pop tracks include I Believe and Children. It's a form of snappy dance-pop that reaches a climax on the multi-textured closing number EMF with its wailing vocal. A convincing combination of pop sensibility and joyous dance rhythms."
5,Innovative,I love being able to label my wines and know what is where without having to pull each bottle out to look at the label. I especially love something that is reusable as I hate waste. Great purchase!
4,Paper or plastic?,"The main reasons I purchased the plastic was sturdiness and reuse able. They are sturdy. The can be reused, but it takes some elbow grease to removed the dry erase. The fine point dry erase markers are hardly fine point. This makes it difficult to write detailed info. I used paper in the past and used pencil, which can be erased. The choice is yours, but I can not give a convincing argument to purchase these instead."
3,"Good quality, but not really eraseable","I bought these rather than paper tags because the description indicated that wipe-off markers would be easily removable from them, making them reuseable. This isn't so--even scrubbing with detergent and water leaves a lot of ink residue. And it's a lot of work for a little tag . . .On the pro side, they are much sturdier than paper."
2,Read Carefully,"I imagine I'm not the only one who fell for this listing...at quick glance these tags are advertised as 're-usable'. I guess if we all marked in pencil, every paper wine tag ever made is considered re-usable. These are paper tags and cannot be used with dry erase marker. The quality is fine, but I thought I was buying tags compatible with dry erase...even the ""other bought with this item"" advertises several dry erase marker kits.5 for being your everyday wine tag.0 for misrepreswentatio."
4,Useful product,"I was tired of pulling out each bottle of wine to find the one I wanted so ordered these. They are erasable so can be re-used but I found the space to write a bit cramped as it is hard to put the producer, type and vintage on the front of each tag. I suppose you could use the back for some of the details or be more cryptic in the descriptions on the front."
2,Weird plastic,"Indestructible? Probably, but you can't write on them with pen or pencil. They are that weird shiny plastic material that doesn't absorb moisture, so ink can't ever dry. I was able to smudge the ink even after 24 hours.Go with single-use paper tags."
3,description,"SUICIDE IS FOREVEROver 600 teens attempt suicide each day, and six of them never live to see tomorrow. Interviews with suicide survivors explain the hopelessness and despair that caused them to give up on life. Learn critical warning signals and practical steps to restore hurting people to hope. 20 min."
5,Beautiful and Wonderful,This is a book I will share as a gift with friends and family who have lost loved ones. Thanks to the real people who have shared such touching and wonderful experiences.
3,Maybe?,"I can totally understand both sides of the coins. On one side you have people saying ""Yes, this is proof of Jesus Christ"" while on the other side you have people saying ""This is such nonsense, and I believe in Near-Death Experiences!""I am going in the middle. While I have read perhaps a thousand plus NDE cases, they don't compare to half of what is in this book. Not even full-fledged books compare to some of the stuff that comes up in this book. I don't know if these people were all brought together because of how well their cases could be documented, or if they are all liars. I just don't know. I can't call anyone a liar, but the fact is that out of all the NDE cases I have read, the ones in this book are extremely extravagant. I will just say this: If you love NDE books like Life After Life, stay away. If you are a Christian and want more proof that Jesus is real, buy this book.John McAdam, author of:Enoch and the Extraterrestrials"
4,The Mythic Hitler,"""The Mythic Hitler"" is a power telling of the rise and fall of the man now synonymous with incredible evil. This award winning program contains rare footage and interviews with William Shirer, James P. O'Donnell (author of ""the Bunker"") and Nazi hunter Simon Weisenthal. Narrated by Edward Mulhare 30 minutes/NTSC"
1,Worst book I have ever bought,"The idea for the book is great. A quick skim through in the book store had me thinking this was the book I was looking for. When you actually start to read the various entries you will quickly see this is not an objective book. There are a number of entries where the author passes judgement on a religions he disagrees with and condemns it's followers. This is not a guide to religion, it is a fundamentalist review and rating. The author is an obvious evangelical christian with a axe to grind. It's very sad. I bought this book to assist me during some international travel and it is now in the trash can in my hotel. Unless you are an evangelical christian looking for a guide on how to judge and attack people of different beliefs, this book is not for you.an example from the book - ""members of this faith should reexamine their beliefs and have the courage to return to the Christian faith as described in the new testament"""
2,Disappointed!!,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is not a truly objective, scholarly work, in my opinion. The author's evangelical Christian viewpoint is evident in many of the reviews, which he readily admits to in the preface. So if that level of bias is acceptable to you, then okay, but I was expecting, from my reading of the reviews, a more objective unbiased book actually objectively discussing 100 religions from a neutral position. BE FOREWARNED!"
5,Great Songsmith,"This is the first CD from Ron Sexsmith I have bought, and it will certainly not be the last one. Accompanied by two guitars and some occasionally drums, the result depends heavily on the voices and the songs. And I must say they are both beautiful. I hear influences, like Paul McCartney, Everly brothers, Louvin brothers and even an early Nils Lofgren. But the songs stand on their own, and it is typically a CD you play when you want to hear something beautiful and timeless. Highlights for me are 'Counting on time' and the absolute killer....'Only me'."
5,another great Ron album,"another astonishing album..............frankly with Ron you are safe to buy any of his albums and you get a record full of classics..............no duff stuff. I am 50+ and been listening to songwriters all my life. I never expected such an eyeopening talent to come so late into my life, I only recently discovered Ron with his 2010 album Long Player, Late Bloomer........... I am amazed by this mans songs and have since bought all of his back catalogue and have listened to nothing else for the last 8 months"
5,Word of caution... don't loose the remote.,I think this unit is great. If you misplace the remote you will be unable to change the message or enter new ones. So be careful with it.I'm still waiting for a nice warm day when I can set out behind my car and fully program it with messages.Biggest negative is you cannot tell what message is playing without getting behind the car and viewing it.Watchout and make sure your installer doesn't put an offensive message on when he installs it. Mine did and that didn't leave me realy happy.
2,Led license plate frame,"I got this item less than a month ago & it already shorted out already, normally i have no problem with amazon but this item was poorly made..."
1,crapola,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT STOPPED WORKING THE FIRST TIME IT GOT WET, IT IS A LICENSE PLATE HOLDER IT GOES ON THE OUTSIDE OF A VEHICLE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET WET!!!!"
3,Haven't used it yet.,It seems a little difficult to actually use so as of yet I still haven't used it. I may just give it as a gift to someone who has the time to mess with it.
3,Something More,"Bon film mme s'il ne restera pas dans les annales, pour amateurs de ce genre de film, on passe un bon moment mais ne le regarderais pas plusieurs fois car il traine en longueurs. Vendeur recommander,envoi rapide. Arriver avant Nol."
3,"IT'S ONLT ME, BUT:","TWO BOY'S FIGHTIING OVER ONE WOMEN. NOTICE I DID NOT USE THE TERM ""MEN"".BOY'S WILL BE BOY'S, STUPID. SOME ASPECTS ARE AMUSING."
3,Shows just how sick and twisted people were then...,"This journal includes graphic depictions of human torture. It is not a romanticized version of a lovely plantation. Byrd shows his true nature with vivid depictions of how cruel he treated his ""slaves"". Great book to help research plantations."
1,Wretched,All this movie does is eat up ninety minutes of your time that you could use to do something productive. I feel sad for the saps who bought this video because now they'll have to deal with owning a worthless tape to an incredibly bad movie. A fact that's more interesting than the movie itself is that the person who directed (and stared in and wrote it) was Tyler in ET The Extra Terrestrial.
2,book,"Alot of info in this book was redundant, and there was a lot of ""filler material"". I did not find it helpful at all."
4,Good Book!,I needed this book to support my thesis for my final project at my University. It was helpful and easy to read.
2,He looks like a nice guy but...,"He looks like a nice guy but this book doesn't get into detail; it just show generics. A ""how-to"" book should do just that - show you HOW TO do something. This book doesn't do that."
5,This book is a great help in drawing and is easy to use.,"This book is great! It teaches you how to do many things such as draw facial features, body poses, costumes etc. One thing that I found that it was missing was a chapter about drawing muscles. Each character drawn in the book has muscles but it doesn't actually show you how to draw them. This is a great companion book to Marvels ""Draw the Marvel Comics Super Heroes."" Heroes and Villains not only gives you in-depth instructions on drawing, but it also gives you tips from the pro's and also tips on how to get a good start in the business. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn new drawing skills as well as refine old ones."
2,Not much help!,"This book is pretty pathetic. The instruction is minimal and the art is just so average it's not even funny. You would at least hope that someone telling you ""how to"" could do it themselves. Get drawing the marvel way it's not perfect but it beats this hands down."
3,A book mostly on what is appealing in a comic,"This book is bad for beginners. It says to start out with a stick figure. Good. It says stay loose with your drawing. Good. 8 pages on the head and nothing on muscles. BAD. A person would be able to draw a good head, but thats it. The book gives helpful suggestions on what type of characters make a good comic book and how to make the panel look good. If you want anatomy get the marvel book with the tools, you'll be drawing better in no time. then come back and get this one for making an book."
1,this book's best suited for very talented 6 year olds,"I find that the text is far too basic and simplistic to go along with the pics, which are well drawn but boring. The author's hints and tips are rarely related to the craft of drawing but rather are inane comments about giving heroes a shiny pistol and villains evil eyeglasses. In the end, this book is a collection of pics and while one can learn from looking at them and copying them, I think you're better off doing the same with whatever manga or comics you have lying around."
2,decent for beginers,"If you have little to no cartooning talent what so ever the go for this book. If you're halfway decent all ready dont bother. The writer/artist is an obvious amature and to my knowledge has never worked on a major comic. It does have a few good points but not many. I personaly found this book to be a waste of my time, if you are looking for a good instructional book for creating comics i suggest ""HOW TO DRAW COMICS THE MARVEL WAY"" which is much more in depth than Mr. Hart's book."
3,Eh...,"Frankly I didn't learn very much from this book. The art in it is pretty nice, but I think it tries to be too broad in its teaching. The book seems to attempt to show the user how to I didn't really find anything to be all that helpful in improving my artwork. That's about it. It's a nice book, but was more visually pleasing than helpful in my case."
5,Excellent Self Help Book,"Pat Wyman has provided an excellent workbook for anyone seeking a better understanding of themselves. Combining the strengths of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the Ennegram and Inner Child work is pure genius. This book is easy to read and apply with or without a trained professional. I benefited from each chapter and especially from the hands-on techniques for healing the child within."
5,"Extremely informative, prepares you to go to the top!!!","Excellent book, so complete, no other book would would give you the physics behind holding a ball, etc. I recommend to anyone who would like a proper introduction to Rhythmic Gymnastics. It even tells you what vitamins and minerals to take for optimum performance levels. It is a book I refer to constantly, I am a better gymnasts because of it:-)"
4,"Good Book, Could Be Even Better","This book has a lot of information and the sections make it easy to read. The drawings are helpful in demonstrating many of the elements. One thing that's surprisingly missing from it is specific flexibility development techniques and images; the information on the subject is too general for what I was expecting. For example, It doesn't go into oversplit training, back folding, etc. It seems that this book is meant to supplement other rhythmic technical guides, not be a full and thorough guide."
2,Boring,if you like lots of pictures and visual demos this book will bore you to death. To many words and not enough graphics.
1,"Uhhh, okay.",Basically it's 50 minutes of rednecks falling off their motorcycles or spinning out in their cars. I don't think any vehicles were harmed in the making of this flop.Flagrant false advertising! There are better crashes on the nightly news. Save your money and avoid this!
4,Long search finally over.,"Blackbriar is one of the best books I have ever read. I picked it up in the 4th grade and was totally blown away by the mystery and intregue. Needless to say, ever since I finished reading it I have looked for it non-stop for years. The skilled way that it is written, the dark foreshadow and evil overtone of the whole thing just made me want to turn pages all night long. It is the reason that I started to enjoy reading as much as I do now and has influenced my taste in the books that I do read to this day. Since it was the 4th grade when I read it the fine details escape me, but the general impression will live forever. The old house and the names carved into the door. The midnigt bonfire ceremony. It all ties together to make a excellent dark novel in which even the masters like Stephen King and Chris Carter would be proud to have attached to their correspondence."
5,Great mystery for the young adult,Blackbriar is a great mystery for young adults. I read it when i was 11 years old and i still remember it to this day. Its captivating and keeps you on the enge of your seat without being too frightening for a young mind. I would recommend it totally. Enjoy!!!!!!!
3,My new old favorite,"Been reading some Lois Duncan books, Susan Cooper, and the fairies series, Thirteen Treasures. In a dark fantasy mood I guess. Black roar has the basic elements. Orphan. Selfish caretaker. Old house. Evil reputation. Isolated location. Odd neighbor girl. Mysterious gentry in the Hall. By the time the cat is thrilled by the strange little doll left in the parlour, you'll be turning on the lights. I hope your cat doesn't jump on you during the last half of the book. Nice little slice of darkness. If you like Hammer films, you'll like this book. C r e e p y . . ."
4,"Short, fast and totally predicitable...","This book was pretty predictable from beginning to end. That being said, it was quite an enjoyable read. It was a quick read, I think I read it in two sittings or so. The end was a little hokey for my tastes but it didn't ruin the experience. I actually really enjoyed the setting of the book. I believe the author really set up the location well and it was a place I would actually like to visit...during the day. I would totally recommend this book for a quick read, curled up on the couch on a rainy afternoon."
4,RFBR,"It's been a long wait for this album to be released on CD. This was my favorite Ritchie Family album. The sound quality/resolution is amazing. The only reason I give it 4 out 5 is the promotional 12"" remixes of Bad Reputation & Put Your Feet To The Beat are not on here."
5,E,"I hope this company release the main vinyls from The Ritchie Family, but this one has a very good sound and the presentation is excellent, as the Long Play (vinyl)."
3,Good packaging but poor quality,The product came with three boxes missing and they were shipped to me after a phone call. The product does not seem as effective as other brands of Royal Jelly that I have tried. Allen
2,Skip this one...,"There's absolutely NOTHING new here, and it is based only on secondary sources. Folks should read Middlekauf's GLORIOUS CAUSE instead, and leave this one on the shelves."
4,A bit different from the others...,"I really liked this book. It was a bit different from the others in that (spoiler ahead) Sean was married through most of the book, and the second half found them married in every since of the word. That confused me at first, wondering what more was there to pursue, but there was SO MUCH MORE and Lori did such a wonderful job in taking us all the way there. It was so nice watching this husband and wife grow closer.Though not as exciting as the ""A Place Called Home"" series, ""The Californians"" is still a very good series. I can't wait to start on her next series!!!"
2,"Good story line, but lacking and unconvincing.","The beginning of the story was very interesting and even a little suspenseful. However, as soon as Sean marries the woman who saves him from being hung, he suddenly seems to transform from an angry, rough guy to a perfect gentleman. I found that very unconvincing, and it just didn't seem to work with the first part of the story. The rest of the story was all right, but it didn't really seem like it was the same story anymore. The characters frequently ""almost panic"" or do double-takes over the littlest things. It was really pretty boring, and not worth reading after all.This is the only series of hers I've read, and the only good one was ""Donovan's Daughter"", the last book. I most likely won't try any of her other series, unless I'm desperate for something to read.I've found Wick to have a dull writing style."
2,Just okay,I wasn't all the impressed with this book. I couldn't get into it. Maybe since it is written from the male prespective.
4,Good cleaner,"I just wish more came in the bottle. I used a lot of this cleaner to disinfect my bedroom and bathroom area after recovering from a MRSA infected wound. The cleanser seemed to react with some previously invisible residue that was likely blood (from treating the wound and changing the dressing), it was easy to use and quick. I liked that visible reaction because it seemed all the more efficient, doing it's job of pulling up and disinfecting those invisible but present threats of reinfection. Glad I found this MRSA-killer, I'm still free from recurrent infection. :)"
2,High speed striped out,"The right angle drill is a great tool to have in your quiver,It is a must for installing cabinets and tight quarters. How ever the high speed just striped out drilling counter sink holes. the drill was only used on special ocasions. I replaced it with a power corded model and i am quite pleased.If you need it for little things get one,if you are a pro get one with a power cord."
3,uncharacteristic for clarke,"like many clarke readers, i came to know him through his more popular works like 2001. i have always found his writing to be enjoyable and easy to digest, and have enjoyed the smarter science fiction he's produced.i found this book to be uncharacteristic for clarke in several ways. the obvious change is in the setting, underwater as opposed to in space. however, i found clarke departed from his usual careful attention to science absent, as well. several of the realities of the ocean and the world he's created are ignored. finally, clarke's tenor, which i find to be often optimistic and inspiring, is also toned down.all in all a different book than what i expected, and probably the kind of thing a clarke fan would enjoy when they're looking for a slight departure from the norm. still, not one of his best works."
5,A profound work,"Paul Mariani's personal journey is powerful and compelling. While he shares with us his discoveries and reflections on evils committed in his life, he also is unabashed in his joyous sharing of God's revelations to him.Some of this reads like an unabridged prayer journal, and some has clearly been reworked after the fact. Regardless, Mr. Mariani has a gift for words, and he tells a great story. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.My only caveat is that this is Mr. Mariani's journey, not yours. Remember that what was revealed to him during the 30 days may not be pertinent to his readers.Overall, it's an inspiration. I heartily recommend it."
3,My advice?,"a) Don't spend this much on this type of teevee, in 6 months it will be out of date, and unrepairable should it pack upb) if you ARE going to spend this much (who are you? Paris Hilton?), don't even think of buying it online or mail order, go to Best Buy or any of the myriad tee vee stores, taste and try before you buy, then pay the extra to have them deliver and set up the teevee, and pay for an extended warranty that promises like for like replacement should the unit be unrepairable.I didn't and lived to deeply, deeply regret it!"
3,warranty? scam or necessary?,"I have a brilliant Sony 48inch plasma KDL4000 (Currys) i think. Ive had it about 2.5 years. But Ive recently noticed thescreen is going dark and warpy!. Called a Sony technician out to find, after shelling out 50 call out,yes, the screen is on the way out. Ive already figured that much. But for 1200 it should last a little longer thanit has. Will probably try a cheaper model next time, if they are throwaway products, may as well pay a throwaway price."
3,"Dated, at least for younger gays","This book was written in 1996, and by 2011, it seems a bit long in the tooth. Thankfully, society has progressed and is much more accepting of gays especially among the younger generations. This book seems to come from a mindset that you should expect rejection or problems at every turn, which isn't really a given anymore."
4,A great starting point!,"I great place to start when you are just coming out. Gives great examples, and it very straight forward. I recommend it!"
2,Shambolic,"Hello fellow people. I found this book to be no help whatsoever.I've read it 4 times and I'm still stuck in this lift.I honestly don't know why my friends recommended it me?It would have been better if they'd called the fired brigade (not that I'm into firemen)Maybe if I press this button, oh! The doors have come open.I'out at last!"
2,Not quite horrible,"This was actually saved from being a horrible, 1/2 to one star, movie by the terrific acting turns of James Remar and Randy Couture - neither of whom were on the screen long enough to save this dog. Watching Willis I could only think that actors have also got to eat...not everything can be a blockbuster. Still he could have at least tried. Ryan Phillippe sleep walks here and I can't believe this was this same guy in the great, WAY OF THE GUN. Probably the whole thing just doesn't work because the action centers around the character played by 50 Cent - who can't act worth a plug nickel (but I think he produced the flick). Hard to believe you have Willis, Phillippe, Remar and Couture in a movie that's boring...that cast is what roped me into watching it. You pays your money and you takes your chances..."
4,Set Up Review,"I really like Bruce Willis and Curtis ""50 cent"" Jackson and thought this movie was entertaining. I like action movies and this one could have had a little more action but all in all it was worth watching."
1,Movies this bad are proof that the end of civilization is upon us.,"I truly feel pity for anyone involved with this movie. Not only did the studio lose millions of dollars that it invested to create this artless abomination, but I also pity anyone who loses their hard earned $1.20 foolishly chosing this redbox lemon. I am now angry at my wife for bringing this movie home and turning a mediocre night into a melancholy one. Complete and total FAIL."
2,Not a typical Bruce Willis movie,"Bruce Willis, the reason I purchased this movie, is an after though in this film. The Willis name is simply used to sell the film. That would still be okay if the other actors performed well in their roles. Sadly that is not the case. The quality of the acting is so bad that I gave up about half way through the film. Save both time and money and buy something else."
5,BRUCE WILLIS WITH A GUN YOU CAN'T MISS!!,This movie here has so much action it keeps you guessing from beginning to end!! Must see would be a great accent to any collection!! BJ Shopping in East Point!! Soul's Ladybug
1,"Horrible acting, & plot was a joke","Borrowed this movie from a friend. No one did a good job in this movie at all, Bruce Willis was ok, but he's just not believable as a mob boss, & the plot just had to many dead ends."
3,eh. . .,ok. . didnt fall asleep during it. . plot had some twists and turns that I must admit didnt see coming..
4,Good Movie,"I felt Bruce Willis could have done a little better. 50 Cent is improving on his acting, overall I liked it."
2,"Love Bruce, but they gave him a STINKER in this one","From the jump(start), it looked like there might be something to this movie. But as time passed, the hope of salvation waned. Jackson(.50 cent) should stick to rapping, his skill on the screen are mediocre at best. The plot had potential, but the awful writing and dreadful acting laid it to rest. Bruce(Willis) was up to speed, but he just had nothing to work with and even with his acting prowess he could not save this stinker. If you absolutely NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING to do except maybe watch paint dry, then by all means light this out up. It does stand a pretty good chance against drying paint."
2,UMMMM!!,IF I HAD TO CHOSE AGAIN I WOULDN'T BUT THIS. I ACTUALLY FELL ASLEEP ON THIS.BRUCE WILLIS COULD BE BETTER
1,Bad movie,I'm sorry but this was not a good movie. It was so boring I couldn't keep up with what was going on.
2,"Yes, I was SET UP by this MOVIE","- The dialogues are the best things in this movie. Sometimes, they're so practical that they're funny. For example, after the main character said that his friend was dead. the priest replied:"" Your friend would be in heaven"". The guy asked ""How do you know? Have you been dead before?""- There was a couple of suspenseful scenes. For example, the scene where Mia was interrogated by the enforcer.- However it has numerous illogical holes that are as big as tanks. Many times, they're so big that they become ridiculous. Even a kid in grade 9 can find that those scenes are so far-fetched. For example, Bruce Willis who played a big crime boss but he acted like a fool in the last scene- 50 cent's acting does not help either.In short, it's a below-average show."
1,disappointed,This is definately NOT up to the standard of Bruce Willis' acting ability or past movies. I buy DVDs to keep and watch again but this one I passed on to our local Library just in case someone else may want to watch it.
1,YES I WAS,"Wow, i was definitely setup. I don't know what was worse the acting(or lack of) or the plot. Who signed off on this turd? There was more accidental action and violence than what 50 cent was able the pull off."
5,I am only reviewing the fat burning video,I only own the fat burning video of this series. I just purcased the arm&abs and hips&buns videos but havent recived them yet but i have to say the fat burning video is awsome. My heart rate was way up and i was deffinatly sweating. Also most important it was so fun!! Veena and Neena really know how to belly dance. This made me feel like a sexy belly dancer and i was burning calories too!! I cant wait to get more in there serise. Although it is not that long of a workout. After the warm up you only do about fifteen minutes of cardio. But thats ok i would just suggest doing it twice. I did it yesturaday and my muscles are still sore!!!
2,Too much,"These women are great dancers but they are not great aerobic instructors. Their warm-ups are not long enough to get you sufficiently warmed up enough. I found that my muscles were locking up halfway through the video. The movements are also too isolated. I know that doesn't sound right... what I mean is that if you have an injury like I do, the amount of time the spend holding variations of the same movement wears out my muscles. I cannot hold my arms up in the air for any great length of time. This is a good portion of the workout. They workout the arms then the torso then the legs. If they had spaced out their movements and worked out different muscle groups at ""random"" instead of in isolation I could have done these videos.Ultimately a disappointment. I can't use these!"
1,Booorrrring!,"I found this set boorring! There was more leg lifts and sit-ups than bellydancing. I felt like I could get this workout from Kathy Smith, but at least she's personable and friendly. The video is done with a voice-over that makes it cheap sounding and not really like they are instructing. There was one move that you do when your hand is on your forehead for 5 minutes! I found it extremely BORING!"
5,even for the fat people,"I just wanted to put my two cents in. I am well over weight (I am talking over 300 lbs) I bought this because I know I had to lose weight, I had knee surgery and my weight alone has stopped me from healing. I love this video. I do it every day and on some of the knee moves I cant do I try something else. I have always been in loving with belly dancing and I don't feel like I am working out. I have not really change my eating habits and I have lost 21 lbs. My husband is loving how my body is changing and toning. I love the fact that my jeans are so big on me I can take them off without unbuttoning them. I just purchased the basic dance. I cant wait to explore. I just want to thank those two girls for their creativity and gracefulness. I work hard to mimic their movements and when my weight is gone I am going to belly dance for my husband for our 17th year anniversary"
2,The instruction leaves a little to be desired,"I purchased this set because I was interested in varying my fitness routine and was always interested in bellydancing-I figured this would be a great way to combine the two. I do enjoy watching the dancing at the beginning and end of each video and the music is really great. I found the incomplete instruction and lack of transition make the videos hard to follow.Neena & Veena are performing the exercises but there is another woman narrating and there is no verbal transition from one exercise to the next which makes it hard to follow at first. There is also no real instruction to explain what it is you are supposed to be doing, you just have to figure it out by watching what is going on on your screen. This makes it even harder to follow because you are focusing on what they are doing and not really doing anything yourself. When you are just starting out you may not see any benefit until you really learn the moves."
5,A Great Workout Set,"This series is very professionally done; some of the nicest instructional videos I've ever seen. The sound quality is excellent, no echoes, and the music is just the right volume. The ""Belly Twins"" show you terrific exercizes that are easy (relatively!) and low-impact. You get a great workout, and learn movements for dance all at the same time.Please don't mistake this for a dance instruction video; it is not, although you are treated to delightful performances by the instructors. This is a workout series, which have movements that are either very much like dance movements, or ARE dance movements, practiced over and over, toning the muscles used in that motion. I highly recommend these!"
5,Excellent crossing training for belly dancers,"I really loved this workout set! The instructors are professional and friendly. The production is well planned and the lighting is very good. The Basic Moves, consist of common moves, and the other videos are more aerobic in style. This is really a good buy for cross training."
2,This could have been taught in one video,"I felt ripped off by being sold 4 videos, when only one was really bellydance: Basic Moves. The other videos were workout videos, and I could get a better workout from experts like Kathy Smith. The packaging makes you feel like you might as well get all 4 videos, but you really only need one."
2,Not a good representaion of Bellydance,"This video was well produced, but don't expect to learn how to bellydance. The twins are beautiful, but I wish I had not bought these tapes, unless you are really old or REALLY out of shape I would not bother with these, and try something else, I like Shamira, and Dolphina's Video's MUCH better. I would give these videos I have bought of NEENA & VEENA away but I don't want someone to think so poorly of bellydancing. So in other words they are so bad I wouldn't give them away. Children may enjoy watching them but these are NOT for any semi-serious adult who wants to learn."
1,too much money for humminbird side imagimg using this transducer,"Bought a 798 SI for $1500, hoping to see fish to the side of the boat. Useless and even the regular fish finder does not work as good as my much cheaper Lowrence."
5,very useful,"Great for a motorized bike with a clutch, so you can have dual brakes.Exactly as described, good price, definitely worth the money."
1,Weak casting,"Was using it for a non-standard bike and had to spread the clamp to fit around a handlebar and as soon as I went to tighten the clamp, the clamp cracked in half. Looking at the surface, the casting is very porous. Got it to work, but it involved welding a replacement clamp on.As far as I can tell, this is the only model of dual cable brake lever that is available. Several other online stores sell this handle, but all are the same as far as I can tell.Knowing just how bad the casting is in the black housing/clamp, I would be worried about using this on my own bike."
4,Great Safety Device,The setup on my gas powered bike has a clutch lever on the left handle bar. Between the clutch and brake lever being so close it presented a safety problem.Combining both brakes to one lever on the right side eliminated this hazard.
5,THIS THING IS SWEET,"STURDY CONSTRUCTION, EASY TO INSTALL ,WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE WHY HAVE TWO WHEN ONE WORKS GREAT"
5,Good price,"Good brake lever,not cheap,works really great.Best price i found looking on the internet,would recommened it for some one with a gas bike."
5,SWISS ARMY DIVEMASTER SHOULD BE NAVY SEALS' STANDARD WATCH!,"WATER RESISTANT TO 300 METERS, LARGE FACE, AND EXTREMELY EASY TO READ, AND PLEASING TO THE EYE, THIS HAS TO BE SWISS ARMY'S NICEST WATCH OUT!AS A COLLECTOR OF FINE TIME PIECES, INCLUDING TAG, AND OMEGA SEAMASTER, THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE WATCHES TO WEAR!"
3,swiss army watch,the watch came with the points of the hands pointed slightly upward. since i already took out a link it can't be exchanged. :( otherwise it came in a timely manner in very good packaging.
1,Jomashop = Exceptionally POOR service,"Exceptionally poor service from Jomashop. Shipping was charged at a premium, the shipping took over 2 weeks US to AUS = pathetically slow. The watch was not working when it arrived. Returning the item was impossible with Jomashops poor service. Jomashop's customer service is the worst that I have ever experienced. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM JOMASHOP - shop elsewhere.Jomashop is not an authorised dealer for Victorinox so if purchasing from outside of the US where you might need a warranty cover shop elsewhere."
3,ipaq for dummies generally,book is too general. tries to cover to many different models and is not very specific on most functions. does not give any information if a function does not work as it is supposed to. i would not purchase it had i been able to review it a bit.
4,Marvelous,"Psuedo- advice guy Louis Phillips shows us his greatest wit yet in this selection. I was attracted to this book because walruses are my absoulute favorite animal. Even though most of the book is not about walruses, it was still a pleasure. Covering every topic form English to History. How do you lift a walrus with one hand? You'll just have to read this to find out."
2,CASBAH HUMMUS,"AGAIN, KIND OF A DOWNER COMPARED TO THE FANTASTIC FOODS BRAND. I KNOW THE INGREDIENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR, BUT SOMETHING IN THE TASTE AND CONSISTENCY IS JUST NOT SPOT ON. LOOK FOR THE ""FANTASTIC FOODS"" BRAND AND DO YOURSELF A FAVOR."
3,"Good product, but too much lemon!","Too much lemon for my taste, but will try to water it down a bit more to see if I can dilute the lemony part of it, otherwise, it's a convenient tasty way to enjoy hummus."
1,Tasted like lemon cleaner,"This was easy to make and had good consistency, but when I tried it it was TERRIBLE. The lemon was overpowering to the point where that it tasted like a cleaning product, and my husband agreed. We are not super picky about our hummus, but will never buy it again. Maybe it was just a bad batch from the company, but I'm not willing to spend the money to find out."
4,Very good after doctoring (revision 1),"This product is a bit bland and dry using instructions on box. Instead, I add 1 1/2 cups H2O, 1/2 cup lemon juice, and 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil to get a good consistancy without getting too runny. If you prefer less lemon, use 1 3/4 cups H2O, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil."
2,Not thick enough! Very disapointed!,I figured that any hose made from Cashmere and costing over $25.00 would be very thick and warm. These were not any better than the ones I saw for less in the department store. I was very diapointed!
4,good value high shipping,"I bought this because I found a clay cooKing pot at good will for 10 dollars similar ones sell on amazon sell for $49+ I tried it before getting the book and it cooked well But of the many vegetables I used The Peppers were a bit to much ,I think I have a very good deal on both the Clay cooker and the book , I will next try to bake the herb-oatmeal Bread from page 199"
3,"An ok book, but not what I was hoping for","I purchased this book after reading another person's review. However, I got more information from my brother and the internet on how to cook in my clay pot. In all fairness, however, we have a child in our home who has food allergies so we can't cook the way most people do."
3,Could be healthier,I think the recipes in this cookbook could be healthier. It's an old book and people ate differently back then. I think if you take a little time and adjust the recipes they would be healthier.
5,Excellent main dish recipies for clay pot,"I have used this book for 20 years and am ordering a copy for friends. It is one of the two best clay cook books out of seven I have tried-- my other favorite is out of print. I have lots of our family all time favorites marked in this book. Many recipies are relatively low fat or can be modified and use a minimum of canned or packaged ingrediants. That's in contrast with ""Cooking in Clay"" by Joanna White-- which also has lots of breads and desserts, not the best use of the clay pot in my opinion."
4,The clay-pot classic shows it's age.,"Georgia and Grover provide a fun read. There is not an intimidating, high brow paragraph in this book. The recipes include clear, easily followed directions. Reading the opening and any three random recipes will provide adequate information to make one an expert clay-pot chef. Don't let the organ meat recipes frighten you off. They make up a small portion of the book. The authors claim that clay-pot cooking is very healthy - low fat, low sodium, yet richly flavored. The definition of low fat, low sodium must have been much different in 1974. Many of the recipes in this book add unnecessary fat and salt. Some even call for bouillon cubes - Jean Bell's Beef Stroganoff calls for two cubes and is garanteed to make guests thirsty all evening! Most of the recipes are easily tweaked to meet low fat, low sodium guidelines. Nothing wrong with enjoying them in their original sinful forms! Just beware if you buy this book seeking health reform."
5,No Time to Cook? Let the Claypot do all the work!,"I purchased a Romertopf clay pot 5 years ago and bought this book soon after. Grover's Roast Chicken recipe was my first attempt and it was scrumptious! I steered clear of the recipes containing organs but I found that soups, stews and even breads turn out beautifully in the clay pot. I now have 3 sizes and would advise the user to line the pot with parchment paper just to reduce the cleanup time. This book helps to demystify a basically simple cooking utensil and you will love the results. Food is packed with flavor and moisture and you just have to sit by and wait to serve. It is a lifesaver for those of us who love a home-cooked meal but don't have the time after a long day at work."
5,Must have for Clay Pot Cooking,"Kind of my bible for clay pot cooking. Have worn out one copy and am currently on 2nd. Excellent recipes but dont expect pictures - you dont need them. Just try the recipes. If you havent tried clay pot cooking yet you are really missing out on an incredible experience. The flavors you get from this cooking method are like no other. You can use the excellent recipes in this book as they are written, or use the book to adapt just about any of your old favorite recipes to clay pot cooking - just find a recipe in the book that is similar and following the basic cooking instructions for your own recipes. Invaluable if you are cooking in clay."
4,Works Pretty Well,I got this as a replacement part. It matches perfectly and works pretty well. Hard to beat for the price.
1,Looks good - wears out fast,"The sprayer looks like brushed nickel and has a ""Limited Lifetime Warranty"" on the finish only. The button that toggles between spray and stream works well. What is poor about this product is that the threads are plastic. My sprayer lasted about 9 months before the hose connector (made of metal) broke free of the plastic threads. This was with normal kitchen use. Of course, the faucet was running at the time and it sprayed the kitchen with water. I haven't found a similar looking product made of all metal. So, be prepared to replace this sprayer head every year."
3,Works well but mine broke,For the price it was great but maybe order a dozen and keep them in reserve. I had mine for a month or two and then the phone/clip got caught on my jacket and the clip snapped off. Otherwise it worked well and kept the phone on my belt. Can't beat the price.
4,It only cost 1 penny??!!????????,"I couldn't believe the price. All that I paid for was the shipping, which was like $3.50 (super slow speed...It only took about 1 week). I have broken about 5 holsters of different styles and brands during my cell phone usage. They usually tend to break getting in and out of cars. I can tell just by looking at this that it will have a short life span!! For right now this thing is working great......Hence the 4 stars.Edit: As predicted this thing shattered in less than 3 months while climbing into the front seat of a car. Oh well, live and learn."
4,Full Moon Empty Heart,"This is a mellow version of Gary Morris. It has some great ballads, which is why we all listen to him. One fall is all it takes, it a great song with a lot of hidden meaning. Moosechin stew is a glimps into the lighter side of his work. The Man Upstairs, is a song with spirit and compassion. It's a nice album, if you're a Gary fan, this is one, you'll enjoy."
1,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered white magnetic door weatherstrip but received a brown one. I'm expecting a refund but have not received one as yet. After I receive my refund, I'll call to see if white one is available."
1,ok product,WE have one of these kettles and would not recommend it to anyone. We are looking to replace it because it is not that functional and a little on the unsafe side: boiling water spurts out when you pour the hot water out. I have even had the hot lid fall off onto my hand when trying to pour out the last bit of water because I happened to not quite fill it enough.
1,The Bodum Ottoni Stovetop Kettle,The Bodum Ottoni Stovetop Kettle looks beautiful and looks like new but it is factory defected. It does not hold water. The water leaks out of the bottom of the kettle.
3,Pretty but needs design improvements,"I owned this tea kettle for a few years. After letting it boil to empty so many times, it finally became burned beyond help, but it did boil quickly. My complaints are that the round blue tip of the lid melted off and the wooden handle came apart more than once. The brass colored screw that holds the handle on, loosened and I found it on the floor, not realizing what it was at first. The handle was hot and required the use of a pot holder.So...pretty, functional, but could use design improvements. I'm looking for a new one now and I'm not convinced enough to buy another one of these."
3,Gitzo monopod 1564 mk,"There is little question that GitzoGitzo G1564 MK2 Studex 4 Section Monopodseems to be forever changing its product serial numbers. So when you order a product you had better be precise. That was my experience with this product. It was not what I was looking for: it did not have the latest locking leg mechanism, which is a welcome advance in making leg adjustments an almost one-hand operation. This particulart monopod is probably best-suited for someone wishing to hold a 35mm, or digital camera, with an extremely heavy, presumably telephoto, lens. At 2lbs, it's a bit weighty for the average walking around photographer. Gitzo products are superb and this particular item is very well made in that tradition."
5,"A must read, even if you have to read it again and again","This book took me on a deep journey. Granted it may take most more than giving it a once over, but if you spend the time and effort to really get to know the book, and research exactly what the author is saying it is well worth the time that you took to understand it. A great read, and will challenge even the most agile mind."
2,Not for me,"There is an audience for a book like this. It just was not me.I am 25 years old and lost my mother to breast cancer two years ago.This book reaffirms my belief that everyone has a different story to tell about cancer and how it has touched their life. I was looking for some common ground and found little with the author. For me, the book was simply a series of metaphors comparing nature with life. Beyond that, the reader has to sift through the mind of the author, seemingly reading her thoughts as she writes them. I appreciate how personal this must have been for the author to do, but it was quite abstract."
4,Very helpful and moving book.,"Collection of letters the author wrote to her best friend Harry during the last year of her mother's life... I think this book would be a great help for anyone in a similiar situation -- the author puts into words many of the emotions both sides go through (anger, fear, confusion, frustration, sadness, hope, apathy, etc.) and helps the reader understand the progression through the phases of death and how each one can make one feel. While I'm not a caretaker for a dying mother (let's not even think about that right now), I saw a lot in the dying mother of this book that I also see in my 90+ year old great aunt. Reading this book helped me better understand her anger and frustrations, something I think will help our relationship greatly over the remaining years of her life. Recommended to anyone looking for some help with this kind of thing."
4,This game is great!,"I love horses and this is my favorite horse game to play. Equestriad 2001 is awsome. There are many horse colors to choose from and rider's outfits. You can even be famous horse riders like Pippa Funell or David O'Connor. The game has great commentators too. There are also many cheat codes that make the game more interesting. One thing i dont like about it is that you cant groom your horse, and there is no stable.The only bad part about this game is Mary King's Riding Star. There is only one horse you can ride. Even though you can turn your horse out to pasture, there is nothing much else to do. The grooming is boring. The riding part only gets worse. The cross country and dressage are drab. THe show jumping is probably the best part of this sleeping pill!"
4,Will only bother with 3 day eventing,"i wont bother with Riding Star and Equestriad 2001, they're too boring.You dont even get to take care of your horse in Equestriad 2001!3-day eventing is THE ABSOLUTE BEST out of the three!!!!Much better, but you cant get some piles of poo in Taffy's stall(palomino).The beginning kinda sucks, you only have one horse,and its hard to get credits.But once you get another horse it gets easier.Plus,in the trivia card part,some cards repeat.The good things are that you can play FOREVER if you want,theres no ""ending"",like in many other games.The first night i had it(friend loaned me it) i LOVED IT!!!I had to go to bed,though,but i couldnt wait till the next morning!!Boohoo,i had to give it back a week later.THIS IS THE BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED,THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 4 STARS IS BECAUSE OF THE RIDING STAR AND EQUESTRIAD 2001 GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Let's Ride is the BEST OF ALL THE HORSE GAMES!!!,"Let's Ride Champions Collection is the greatest! I used to have a 2-disk copy with only 2 games, Riding Star and Equastriad. I just LOVE Equastriad, but Riding Star is a little bit worse. And I see why they called it ""Riding STAR"" because the main horse's name is Star. But those disks I have lost and so I am buying the 3-disk one with my own money. I have not tried the 3rd game, but I'd LOVE to! This is my fave of horse games, even though none of my present Let's Ride games have let me down. A lot of others have, though. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE LET'S RIDE PC HORSE GAMES! THEY ARE THE BEST!"
3,Good game for an older one,This game was pretty fun and the graphics where okay for an older game. As long as you don't care about graphics buy this game. It was my first horse game and provided hours of entertainment.
3,Equestriad is the best game of the collection!!,I got this game for the fun it. Most of the game collection won't work on Windows Vista. But Equestriad works perfectly. It's a great game.
5,I LOVE this game,I love this game. 3 day eventing is the best! The other two are alittie boring. I would recommend this game. It is the best LetsRide game ever!
1,Not good,"I must have gotten a bad cd,because everthing went wrong! First of all,on the Equestriad 2001(it has three diffrent games on 2 cd's,and this was one of the game's title) the announcer kept skipping(replaying and interupting such as: The sunshine's out to-) He meant to say The sunshine's out today,and he kept repeating it. Plus the 3 day eventing thing kept saying fatal termination and then it exited. Plus your horse could be out in the grooming area,and then from a distance you could still see the horses head in the stall! And the Equestriad 2001 didn't even jump that well! I probably got a bad cd,but it still caused a lot of uneeded stress! It's your choice."
2,Let's Ride - a dissapointment,"I just bought this software for our 6 year-old daughter who loves to ride. I have experienced the same as a previous rater - sound effects were annoying, when they worked. THe majority of the time the music and voices just skipped over and over. I couldn't even get the first game - where you learn how to care for your horse - to load on to our computer. When I tried to contact customer support, I discovered that there is no 800 number provided, just an e-mail address to send my request to....and that only got me a canned reply.Our daughter was very excited about finding this game in the store, but quickly became sad that the game wouldn't work properly.I'm taking the CDs back and finding something else as soon as possible!"
4,Murder mystery set in Chicago during the summer of love,"It's Chicage, 1968, the summer of love. Cassandra Perry, early 20s, has moved out of her Aunt Ivy and Uncle Woody Lisle's place and into an integrated commune. Cassandra and the other members smoke lots of dope, listen to music (she enjoys Hendrix), and protest the Vietnam War. Their tight-knit, happy household is rocked when two members are found gruesomely murdered. Displaying anger and purpose, Cassandra resolves to expose their killer. She uncovers a possible police coverup and a militant black group aiding in the desertion of black soldiers. The commune members begin to suspect each other. Despite a somewhat slow start, once the narrative gains traction, events spill out at a satisfying pace. I liked the several surprising twists and Cassandra becomes a sympathetic, hip protagonist. This is a perceptive, intelligent read good for a few hours of engrossing pleasure."
2,mediocre at best,"I have to admit, bought this one purely on looks (ours has a different fabric pattern/color, but the same faux wood). Would not buy again because:1. Changing table leans to the unsupported side (even with our 8 lb newborn). I assume this will get even worse as the baby gets heavier;2. Sleep platform severely sags in the middle. We can only position baby in certain places, otherwise his head will end up below his feet;3. Canopy constantly pops off. The clips are insufficient, and they need to be snapped in after popping off every time we adjust the canopy;4. Vibration motor rattles against sleep platform. It's loud- had to stuff towels in there to buffer; and5. Music/sounds are too loud. The lowest setting is disruptive when baby is in light sleep.Bottom line- looks good, doesn't work so good, overpriced given its shortcomings. Look elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Out of all of our baby gear, this is one huge disappointment! We bought this primarily because of the very elegant look and that is about all it is good for! When our baby was a newborn, we used the changing area, but even at 7 lbs she was too heavy for the bassinet. It is way too clunky to use as a travel crib now that she is older and it makes the Graco Pack n Plays look like ingenious inventions. The crib doesn't come with a sheet for the mattress pad, so we ordered one. It makes the mattress pad ""SNAP"" up sometimes, even when our baby is IN the playard! Horrible! Like every other owner, the hood NEVER stayed in place and the vibration for the bassinet is very noisy. This thing is a disaster and I wish we had never bought it! I wouldn't take this playard if they paid me to! Sadly we bought it at its highest price and I kick myself every day over it. Ugh. Run in the other direction!!"
3,I'll buy a Graco next time.,"My daughter slept in the bassinet part of this play yard until we moved her into her room. This 'mattress' seemed softer than others I had looked at but apparently was not as sturdy and began to sag long before she was 15 pounds (which is the weight limit for the bassinet). I called the company and they replaced it (after the standard time allowed, which was very considerate of them) but the replacement also began to sag: this is when we gave up and moved Baby to her crib. (My sister has the Graco play yard she purchased for her first 5+ years ago and my daughter didn't roll to the middle of that one.) Also the mattress rattled against the battery pack when the vibrator was on. The bassinet part of the play yard holds my only complaints, though!"
2,Horses have no idea...,I hung the Jimmy's Yummy Balls or whatever they are called and my horses LOVED them and ate them in to days. Soooo I thought something a little less expensive might entertain them on a rainy day as well.....NOT! They have absolutely NO interest in them what-so-ever!!!
3,"Handy, but destructive and unstable.","Very handy socket. Grips any bolt or nut, sure - but it's not very stable (you have to hold the socket straight against the nut) and this socket will also scratch the edges of every bolt you use it on."
2,"Software, not hardware","Having sold tools at Sears for years, I have seen every type of gimicky tool that has carried the Craftsman name. However, the Gator Grip is one of those tools that I have to shake my head at.It does the job that they show on tv, but that is about it. It is handy for those weird, around-the-house type projects. However, don't expect it to hold up if you decide to do a major project. As you can see from some of these reviews, it is good for small demolistion projects. Just don't depend on it for everything.Nothing can replace having the actual tool in your toolbox. A good set of wrenchs, sockets, and screwdrivers will last a person a lifetime!"
1,Peice os junk.,I went all wasted a lot of time driving to town to get a tool to remove some rusted bolts. I asked the girl at the auto parts store if it really worked. She just said that they sell a lot of them. Doesn't work at all on a rusted bolt. I'm taking it back for a refund.
1,I would buy but,I would buy this tool if..........1. I did not have to but a socket wrench2. I did not have to buy a a drill adaptor
2,gator grip,Gator grip broke after i tried to get locknuts of my car not impressed but i like the company and will be buying more equipment
4,Handy item to have,"This isn't going to complete replace your socket set like they claim, but it will certainly reduce the amount of time you spend looking for the right socket. Its biggest weakness is screwing in when there's not an existing hole -- since it's one-size-fits-all, it doesn't hold things securely. If there's existing holes and you can start the screw with your fingers, it works pretty well. Where it shines is unusual shapes -- it's way better than trying to use a pliers to screw/unscrew a hook, eye bolt, or wing nut. It won't replace your toolbox, but it definitely has a place in it."
3,"Great idea, but not sturdy enough","For my first Gator Grip project I decided to tighten about a hundred of 5/16""x1.25"" bolts to 175 inch-pounds. The bolt heads were damaged, some more than the others, making a regular socket hard to fit; this looked like a perfect Gator Grip application.I am happy to report that the Gator Grip worked as expected. However, about 1/3 way through the job I had my first failure - one of the pins got stuck and wouldn't come out unless I remove the Gator Grip and push the pin through the other side. That pin was getting stuck continuously, and by the time I was done with 96 bolts, several of the Gator Grip pins would have the same problem.Unfortunately, I have to testify that Gator Grip is a somewhat delicate device, and should not be used for anything but for light duty jobs.Update: I got my Gator Grip socket replaced under warranty. The process was fast and easy. Because of that I'd give this product one more star if I could."
1,Semi-adequate for light stuff,"Overall this was pretty disappointing, but one has to wonder whether some industrial designer could fix its inherent flaws. It's cheaply made and has a lot of slop in it, and sometimes the spring isn't strong enough to pop the pins back into position -- pain in the neck to re-position.It's far too inferior in quality to be used for serious mechanical work, but it might be handy if you were installing a whole bunch of big plant hangers, or something else strangely shaped.The basic idea might be workable, but the actual tool is of the ""99-cent tool bin"" quality."
1,total waste of money,"Gator Grip? more like Gator Slip. I've tried it on various things in my home and on my car and it have been completely useless. It does not provide a good ""grip"" of the nut and just keeps on slipping off and I have to constantly re-adjust it. It often will grip for about a half of a turn and then it slips off. Sometimes it takes a while just to make it get a grip of the nut at all.... For $[money amount], I can just buy myself a regular set of sockets and wrench.My recommendation would be don't waste your money and save yourself the frustration of trying to get it to work well. For all the time you waste getting it to grip and all the re-adjusting, you can find the correct sized socket and take off the nut already (you can probably put it back on and take it off again before you even take off the nut once with the Gator Grip)."
1,A Gadget -- Not a Serious Tool,"As other reviewers have noted, the Gator Grip Socket is for very light duty use. Apply any pressure whatsoever to the ratchet handle and the Gator Grip slips off the bolt head, damaging itself in the process. I had used mine only 10 minutes before several of the pins were jammed up inside the mechanism, and they haven't functioned properly since. The idea is clever, but in reality the geometry and physics just don't cooperate for this to be that useful or reliable of a tool."
4,Better than I expected,"It's not a replacement for a traditional socket wrench by any means. Excellent, however for odd-size/shape bolts, nuts, etc. Worked perfectly on square, slighly stripped, probably metric, lag bolts was dealing with."
4,Interesting Post Nuke Time-killer,"Read this as a kid and liked it a lot and revisited it as an adult and found it to be still pretty enjoyable,just the sort of thing for an airport waiting room or bus ride.Something to be started and finished in one reading. Where have all those books gone? Right here! Those of you out there who enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction should find this one of interest. It does set the template for a lot of what came later...in particular The Road Warrior and Waterworld."
4,Wow - brave move,"I first saw BRMC on tour with the Waterboys some years ago and was immediately captivated, having been a die-hard shoegazer fan in the late '80s. I ran out and bought BRMC then Take Them on Your Own. After waiting what seemed like an eternity, I bought Howl from Amazon without even hearing one song. I first thought I had the wrong group. However, after several listens, this album has grown very high on my list.I would say this album has it all - rock, country, blues, folk - everything U2 tried to do with Rattle and Hum. Most important, the passion present on the previous two albums is very much alive. What a wonderful departure.As for the DRM, I run only Linux so have not noticed an issue. I rpped the album to my hard drive in OGG format without a problem."
4,Gospel Songs,Howl pretstavlja svakako veliko iznenadjenje koje su nam priredili BRMC. Da li je neko ocekivao ovakav album? Sumnjam! Howl ne ide na prvo slusanje ali kada vam udje pod kozu tesko cete moci bez njega.Veoma dobar album koji je mogao da bude i bolji da nije dat previse veliki omaz Bob Dylan. Ovako samo cetvorka.
4,A great departure for a great band,"By now, their change of sound is overhyped but BRMC are great at what they do -- whether it's spacey, Britrock influenced songs or the more down-to-earth Americana of their new album.This shows a band at the top of their game -- mellow and thoughtful songs with a hint of pop in just the right places.It's great."
4,Good country-blues record,"very different from the 2 previous albums of BRMC, but even better of them. A change in sound and style;they abandoned that 'Jesus and Mary chain taste' for a dirty old blues-country sound, full of recalls of the past"
5,"Great album, doesn't play in iTunes or on iPod","I loved their first disc and liked the second. While this is a departure for them, it is still a very solid set of songs.However, please know that you cannot import the songs into iTunes and cannot play them on an iPod. If you are a Mac user, you're out of luck."
1,4 Star Music - 1 Star Product,Don't buy this album.This is one of those Sony albums that want you to download their software.Download this album from itunes or somewhere else. Otherwise you will not be able to even put the tunes on your mp3 player.No offense to the guys at BRMC - this is a good cd. But please don't let Sony ever do that again.
2,Hey BRMC fans!!!,"I am let down by this album. I'm still going to see them on this tour, hoping they will play songs from there past two albums. If you're let down also, CHECK OUT the new Warlocks album!! Like BRMC departed from their usual sexy rock n roll, the Warlocks have departed from their spacey style. The Warlocks have a great sixties girl group sound, similar to the Raveonettes. It might get you through your new music craving that wasn't satisfied with the new BRMC record."
2,Was just abot to buyt it BUT,"I just noticed that this cd has the Sony Digital rights. I have the other two cd's from this band, and enjoy them alot, these guys are great.But i WILL NOT buy this or any cd with Digital rights software on it. Since the fiasco Sony brought upon the world with their attempt to ""protect"" their music. I am all for the rights of the musicians, and i am more then happy to pay for their work, but since they hardly get any money for their work, i dont think subjecting my computer to monitoring by a billion dollar company is worth it.I'll stick to indie music, and other musicians and companies that turst their listeners. If that means i can no longer purchase music in cd form, so be it. I can always go to a show and pay my money there to see it live.DONT LET COMPAINES MONITOR WHAT YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER!!!!! It is your business what you do and what you listen to. If you allow them to do this, that is one less freedom you have just given up.Have a nice day."
5,Breathtaking,"I have been under the hypnotic spell of this album subsequent to the third or fourth listening. It's outstanding, beguiling, mesmerising. Certainly a departure, but not as dramatic a departure as the first few cursory listenings might initially suggest. HOWL is a bold work that makes some demands on it's audience, demands that will most likely divest it of a some of it's fan base. Standing on the precipice of widespread market appeal, BRMC has taken a step away from a potentially gigantic commercial break towards an edgier, more interesting and unique sound. HOWL is destined to become a seminal album in the genre now known as ""indie rock."" It's a morsel that becomes more and more delicious the more bites you take!"
2,Old Bluesmen Motorcycle Club,All I gotta say is listen before buying this one. Its as if BRMC were channeling a bunch of old time musicians from the Mississippi delta while making the album. I would have been cool with a more acoustic or bluesy album but this is pretty extreme.
1,would love to buy this but not with SunnComm MediaMax 5,"I was all set to buy this CD when I was scared off my the SunnComm MediaMax 5 warning. I don't really feel like spending my hard earned cash on a CD which will automatically install software on my computer even when if I tell it not to (i.e. clicking ""Cancel"" after it Autoruns).If Sony-BMG ever decide to release this CD without copy protection, I will gladly purchase this title."
3,Security,"Simple -- Great album, more to the blues than to the J & the Mary Chain. The security sucks --- I played it on my computer once and now it will not let me play it there anymore --- and the computer is where I spend more than half my waking day."
3,Disappointed....,"This album is not what I expected. I don't think it's what anyone who was previously familiar with BRMC was expecting. I don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it. It is still in a style that I can enjoy and appreciate, but I want my old BRMC back. Progression and evolution are good things, but this is a bit much. Weight of the World isn't too far from their previous incarnation, so I guess I'd say it is the best track on here. Caveat Emptor!"
2,"Good music, garbage CD","Amazon warns you that the CD comes with a security vulnerability. What they don't tell you is that you can't even *play* this CD on a computer without using the bundled software. It's anti-piracy garbage, which means you can't play it, or rip it, without using Sony's onboard junk which creates ""licensed"" files rather than normal MP3's. I wasted hours figuring out why all the tracks were coming through jumpy and skippy; why the CD plays fine on a CD player, but jitters and garbles on the PC. Now I find I can't even use the files it produces on my portable player.It's lovely music, a very interesting change of direction for BRMC. But this CD is BS."
1,DANGER - INSTALLS UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE,"If you run Windows XP, do not insert this (or any Sony BMG) CD in your computer. Without prompting for permission, it will install a cloaked 'Root Kit' on your hard drive that can interfere with the proper operation of your computer and leave it vulnerable to hacking and virus attacks. This software is very hard to remove too. This just happened to me. My firewall did not stop it and it destroyed my anti-virus program and several of my system tray applications. VERY BAD STUFF. YOU ARE WARNED. You can search ""Sony BMG Rootkit"" on one of the big search engines for more information."
4,Solid CD,"I like to save 5 stars for really complete CDs like El Camino by the Black Keys, but this one has a handful of solid tracks. No regrets."
4,brings back the memories,I am so happy to find this music as I used to listen to it under different album title years ago Nat King Cole sings Negro Spirituals.I love it. Praise the Lord!
2,Master Answer,This book works as a supportive material. It is very useful for looking into past training questions. It covers many different questions from martial arts training to taoism.
4,Interesting read,I found this an interesting book. I felt that the author could have held back some of his personal opinions on the more recent issues at American University but they did not significantly detract from his presentation of a significant research effort.
5,Son Love It!,"I personally thought the Barney part was a little long (ugh Barney!) but my 2 year old son didn't seem to mind. Cute video, he watches the whole thing when it's on. I am trying to prepare him for Halloween :)"
3,Spy Smasher does it again!!!!!!,"Being a fan of old serials this one was a gamble that payed off. Knowing it was an old Republic serial I knew it would be of better quailty than any other old adventure cinema. And its a good old rolick with fun twists and turns,and watch for the ad for Dick Tracy."
5,The greatest movie serial of all time!,"Kane Richmond stars as the Spy Smasher and his own twin brother in this, the greatest movie serial ever made. It is set just before the U.S. involvement in WWII, and includes the best action sequences ever filmed in a serial, which just makes up for the Spy Smasher's hillarious costume. A must see for all fans of the movie serial."
5,Saturday afternoon advebture,"The ""Spy Smasher"" serial on VHS tape was perfect. I'm 67 and used to see all these great serials on Saturday afternoons at the local theater. It sure is great to be able to have ""Spy Smasher"" as part of my collection of the original movie theater serials. The VHS tapes and box were in great shape when they arrived."
1,No Spy Smasher or King of Rocket Men in this set,"Spy Smasher and King of the Rocket Men are not in this set!!! Don't bother with this if those are the ones you want. Get them separatly elsewhere if you can ever find them. As well you only get a couple selected chapters each serial and that [smells.] You do get Radar Men From The Moon, but I have it already and will be selling my box set soon enough here. I bought this for Spy Smasher and King of the Rocket Men and I'm pretty upset that they are not here. You get a total of four serials edited and a documentary. It's worth it if you are wanting to just check these out on a less serious level. Enjoy...."
1,Shipping costs were criminal!,I received all the books I ordered and in good condition. My complaint is that the shipping costs were as much as the books and all 25 books are so small and light they would have fit in a large USPS priority mail shipping box which costs less than $10 but I was charged over $120 to ship these books. The entire package weighed less than 8 lbs and measured the size of an 11x17 box about 3 inches high at best. Needless to say I will never purchase from that vendor again. What a ripoff!
1,Question?,"Why does the goodreads ad for this say ""free until 1/31/13"" yet it's priced at more than $3 on Amazon when you follow the link?"
5,Great Epic Story,"I enjoyed this book very much! I wish the love scenes were a longer and more erotic. Nevertheless, a well written story! I agree with some of the other reviewers: VERY cheesy cover and the protagonists' relationship with the nobility and royal family is not very realistic...but that's ok! I read all 469 pages in a couple days."
5,Discover Africa,"What a great read! If you want to walk in the footsteps of great explorers, along with modern day adventures, this is the book for you."
5,The mind reels....,"This much genius in one collection, for this price? Have they lost their minds? Bill Evans pretty much wrote the book on luminous,lyrical jazz piano-playing... and this is an elegant document of his incomparable trio's '61 stand at the Vanguard. Very comprehensive - it even includes lengthy segments of stage patter. A lot of the stuff here has been previously released, but it has never sounded this crystalline and pure...all around great job and a real steal!"
4,Good but not Great,"This is a very good sample of the Bill Evans trio at its best. Its interesting, enjoyable and mellow but it is not innovative. This set will impress fans of Dave Brubeck and mellow jazz but it will disappoint listners expecting ""Kind of Blue"" and John Coltrane style innovation.If you like the mellow Bill Evans style I recommend his ""Nirvana"" set with Herbie Mann. I personally feel ""Nirvana"" is a more innovative recording of this style."
5,"simply stated, a timeless weekend captured in an intimate setting","First of all, I was blown away by the recording. The ambience of the audience only adds to the feeling that you are right there, front row, listening, watching three guys ripping it. This is truly one of the best live recordings I have heard, jazz or otherwise. The reperoire between the musicians seems almost telepathic, but the audience doesnt really appreciate the specialness of what they are hearing. They had no idea that less than a month later Scott Lefaro would be tragically killed in an auto accident.This was a great purchase, but be forewarned, the track sequence can be a problem , it comes in the form of 3 MP3 album downloads. The correct sequence is shown on the album sample page on Amazon. You may have to edit some track #s to get it in the correct chronological order. Once you have that sorted, the entire collection can be burned onto two Audio Cds.Do yourself a favor, get this one..."
5,It's like being there,"I was lucky enough to hear Bill Evans, Paul Motian and Scott LaFaro in person at the Vanguard. This recording is the next best thing to being there because you hear everything the recordng engineer heard. Being there was unforgettable. Evans is the Chopin of America, in my opinion, except Chopin didn't swing or (to my knowledge) improvise. This group of sidemen constituted Evans' best trio ever."
1,Pure Garbage,"Like everyone else is saying, this is absolute garbage and the company is trying to scam you by posting bogus 5-star reviews on Amazon. All products by Transparent Language are basically a 10-page piece of text spoken aloud by a native speaker. To lay the foundations of your language learning they use short, useless help files (a one-page list of the letters of the alphabet and a very sparse introduction to the different parts of speech) and nothing else. What they're selling individually for $40 and $50 was originally all bundled together for $10 on the ""101 Languages of the World"" CD, but as you can imagine they're making quite the killing doing things this way."
2,Horrible,"The music basic rule of audio language learning is not followed: Say it in English, then in other language. Even worse, sometimes the word pair is wrong ... something like (Hospital in Italian) - Train Station. The narrators read a little too slowly. Generic unoriginal lessons, etc. I have found a use for it though. When my mind is tired I lay in bed sometimes and listen to it. For a 7th grader this product may give their Italian a little edge when they go into the classroom. Indeed though, the product is so bad it is almost a con."
5,A Cable That Works!,"I have many cables for my PSP, some with charging capabilities, some just straight transfer cables; however, if I were to buy additional cables, this is the one I would purchase every time. It is high quality, can actually do transfers and charging at the same time and is at a great valued price.There have been other charging cables that were faulty, but this is a trusted brand and I have had no issues with it since I purchased it."
1,Very Difficult to Follow,"I found the book to be very difficult to follow in that it seems to be written for graduate level courses on the subject, with very little practical application. The book provides a detailed literature review but it is a bit dated. There is nothing about the rise of private equity and hedge funds in recent years. The book would also benefit from the use of more examples. Its sheer size and number of chapters makes it a bit disjointed."
5,Excellent Step by Step,"Definitely! once of the most concise and step by step process book. I have read books about valuations and mergers, and they just give you an overview. But definitely, this book helps you prepare, plan and execute, considering all the variables you might come across in a M&A."
1,The propellor is Ok,"The propellor is just ONE not 6 or whatever the picture showed. It is one massive one that the hole is too big for most palnes, or other engines, i looked through all my lanes and windboats to find one that size, and none are that size."
2,Of Liitle Practical Use to Me,"I bought this book to assist me with compliance in the area of video production and broadcasting. For this purpose it is of zero value. I was expecting a concise summary of ""entertainment law"" as it pertains to professional practitioners (i.e. producers). Instead this book is a rambling collection of anecdotes from case history, albeit organized topically.If you find that stuff interesting this book may be for you, but if you need to know how to comply with copyright law as it pertains to video production and broadcasting, look elsewhere."
3,A nice supplement,"This is not a comprehensive program. If this is the only tool you use to learn a Japanese, you will never get very far because all it does is teach you to memorize phrases. There are no daily lesson plans, no step-by-step approach - just a list of phrases to memorize, and then different ways to test your memory.BUT, this is a great program to use in *addition* to a more comprehensive course. If you take Japanese at school (or at home, using a better program such as Rosetta Stone) this program could help fill in the gaps in your main course of study. The thing that is really helpful about this, is that it includes video clips of native speakers carrying on everyday conversations. There are also lots of handy ""travel phrases"" that may not be taught in other programs.JapaneseNow is a great way to supplement another course, but it does not stand alone."
3,"Loved it in the 70's, but...",I was mesmerized by this movie when I was a teen. David Jansen plays the father perfectly! It's on VHS with the old clamshell case and felt like it had been a shelf for the last 30 years. Movie feels really dated and not as good to watch today. Was worth the trip down memory lane for the price!
4,Helpful Information,"I found the information delivered in this book to be straight forward and most importantly tastie recipes. When my doctor rec. the book, I thought it was going to be a diet of cardboard. My use of the book is not for ""yo-yo"" diets, but rather a portion of a medical treatment plan with a diet change."
3,Yummmm,Actually some of the recipes are boring and sooooo basic but some of them are so easy to make as well as yummy.It seems like they use a lot of heavy cream and sour cream so better stock up the fridge with these 2 items..:)My personal favorite is the chicken Aromabatzis..it is soo good !!
1,recipes do not list carb-count!,"i wish i would have bought it used for 34 cents. now i will just donate it to a thrift shop. how can someone write a cookbook without listing the calories and nutrients. Especially when the book focuses on carbohydrate ""addicts"" and the carb-count is never provided!!!!... It is hard to believe that a publisher allowed this book to be published in the year 2000."
3,No pictures,"I hate cookbooks with no pictures in them. But, the recipes themselves are really easy to make. I am not crazy about the buffalo wings one but really like the other chicken recipes."
1,Disappointment,"I have been on the Protein Power diet for about two months and am always on the lookout for good cookbooks. Because of the author, I thought this would be an excellent addition to my growing list of low carb high protein cookbooks. I have returned the book because the recipes do not provide you with the nutritional information that, as an active dieter, I require. If I had known about that, I never would have ordered the book in the first place. Fine for people who are not dieting."
2,They call this a cookbook?,"Ok, well maybe I'm a cookbook snob, but I couldn't fathom some of these ""recipes"". Baked Brie? I mean come on... who needs a recipe to put a wheel of Brie into the oven?? Or putting sausage in the oven with mustard slathered all over it, or rolling up some chicken and mustard in a lettuce leaf. These are more IDEAS but RECIPES??? I will admit to loving Bon Appetit and Jacques and Julia, so you'll need to relate there to get me. Plus, most of their recipes call for ""teriyaki sauce""??? It's like my grandma making hundreds of recipe that call for Mrs. Dash. What do they mean ""teriyaki sauce""? If they really mean that , it has sugar or corn syrup in it. If not, is this meaning soy sauce? If so, why is it in EVERYTHING??? I love low carb food, but this cookbook did not help me come to that love."
2,No nutritional information is a let down,"None of the recipes tell you1) How many calories are in each serving.2) How many carbs are in each serving.3) How much protein is in each serving.4) How much fat is in each serving.Regardless of the taste of the recipes, without basic nutritional information how can anyone truely keep track of their intake.This was a terrible let down for me."
3,Carbohydrate Addicts Cookbook,I enjoyed the cookbook but am disappointed because it does not list the carb content in any of the recipes and in addition there were no dessert recipes.
5,It's So Great I Can't Believe It's a Diet Cookbook,This is the best cookbook ever! Can't believe it's low-carb. I would gladly cook up these recipes without being on a diet. They're easy and fast and most require only a couple of simple ingredients. Don't know how they did it - they made it so simple.But the really good point is the taste. I would use this cookbook instead of Joy of Cooking anyday - and I've lost eight pounds in two weeks. Not bad!
1,low carb food,"Good book for people who cannot come up with low carb recipes, but honestly I found much better low carb recipes on blogs. Low carb pancakes made with eggs, vanilla and some cream cheese. Opsie bread made with egg whites. Making gravy with heavy cream instead of flour or cornstarch. Last time I was on this diet that was my biggest hang up. I could not make and eat pancakes with my family for brunch. Or if we were having sandwiches I couldn't have any. I tried wrapping tuna in lettuce but it was not the same. So salad salad salad. Same ol same ol."
4,Great for Diabetics too,"I have had this book for years and got it originally to loose weight. But now, as a diabetic, it has found a new place in my kitchen as it has wonderful low carb meals you can create for the diabetic in your family. The recipes are easy and quick for the most part and you can create an entire meal menu from this and be confident that your carbs will be very low. I use it in conjunction with many of my other diabetic cook books. There is a good bit of whimsy in it, and the author makes you feel comfortable with the food choices right away."
4,Good ideas,"I started doing the carb addict's diet a few weeks ago and had tried almost all recipes in the original book, but needed more inspiration to keep doing my complemetary meals properly. Good ideas."
5,Loved this Book,I have lost 40 lbs. on the Heller's diet and my doctor says I am very healthy so I am a big believer. How great to now have a whole book of meals to go with it!
3,Good starter cookbook,"I really liked this cookbook a few years back when I was just learning to cook. The recipes are simple, healthy, and pretty good.These days, though, I hardly use it - now that I'm more experienced with cooking, the recipes seem a little bit *too* simple. They're not exactly bland, but they're not very exciting, either. The only thing I still regularly make is the Chicken Paprikash recipe, which is quite good (although I have to turn my stove a lot hotter than the book says or the chicken comes out practically raw).Still, if you're looking for simple and healthy recipes, or if your tastes aren't too adventurous, this is well worth the price."
4,Dieter from NYC,"I think this book is great! It works for ANY diet, especially all the low carb and no carb diets that are out there today. The recipes are tasty and you don't have to spend hours cooking them. This is just the book I've been waiting for. Can't wait to try more recipes!"
1,"Don't buy it, borrow it first.....whatta waste.","I checked this out at the library to 'test drive' it before spending any money. Thank goodness! first of all if you are counting on nutritional stats being included so that you can count your carbs, fahgeddaboutit! No nutritional info whatsoever is included. I also gave up trying to find anything tasty in this book; three recipes of wasted food was enough for me. They just do not taste good, these recipes. I don't know why, they sure seem promising. I've had better luck with other books!"
1,Don't waste your money!..,"I am so angry about this cookbook that I have a good mind to write the Hellers and demand my money back! Not only for the cost of the book, but also for the cost of the food that I wasted when I tried to prepare one of their recipes. I followed the Left Bank burger recipe to the letter, and it was just awful. We ended up feeding it to our dog! First of all, with all that liquid (cream, eggs and sherry), the meat won't form a patty! I believe that this recipe was not properly tested. I am afraid to try anything else for fear of wasting my time and money again. Besides, nothing else really sounded that new or innovative -- most of the recipes just direct you to roll up some meat in lettuce and call it a sandwich. One actually suggests that you roll up leftover chicken in lettuce for breakfast -- I paid[money]to be told to use lettuce as a bread substitute? Save your money and stay away from this ridiculous cookbook!"
4,Working good so far,"I ordered this thinking it was the unscented, not the linen scent so I could neutralize odor from my indoor grow as the smell is very permeating. Have yet to use it for that but the night I got it I put 2 cap fulls in a 8oz mason jar filled it halfway with water and set it in my room. Smoked inside (I never do this due to the smell) the whole night and 5 minutes into smoking the ONA started to overpower the stench. Just this small amount has cleaned my room of all odors and leaves a faint linen scent."
5,Ona Gel,"Excellent product, works as claimed and possibly even better. I will be purchasing more in the future as long as I have odors that need to be eliminated. Prompt delivery in less than a week and arrived intact and in new unopened condition."
4,Reduced Classic,"I have been looking forward for years to see this screen version of Sienkiewicz's classic book. The movie version follows the story line of ""With Fire and Sword"" very honestly but leaves out a lot of the filler material. I am a bit dissapointed with the production in the sense that the battle scenes seem so sparsely populated after reading the novel. I guess that computor enhancement was not available to it's production crew. This was great Polish history but on a reduced scale."
4,Fireman Sam,My 3 year old loves it. The 2-sided DVD is a good deal and works well once you figure out which side is which.
5,Great gift pack,My grandson love Fireman Sam and we got this for him for Christmas. He loves watching the episodes without the annoying commercials and Mom can even take it in the car to play in their portable DVD player. The episode are short which is perfect for an active 2 1/2 year old.
2,A Good Book for Children,"This book of 50 pages seems to be aimed towards young horse lovers. The large-print text is brief and simple, and the true focus is the photography, with color photos on every page. Even so, some of them are grainy, with quality loss due to enlargement."
3,A nice book for arabian lovers,"It has beautiful pictures and informative text on the history, temperament, ways and looks of the arabian horse. It is a nice book for the arabian lover, but there are better arabian books in my opinion."
5,Dog Mannequin for Craft Shows,"I just started a craft business selling handmade dog clothes. I was using stuffed animals for models until I knew if the idea of dog clothes would be popular at craft shows. Well, I found out that I have a niche with the clothes so I needed to make my models more professional looking. The Teafco Standing Leather Dog Mannequin filled that need. My table looks fantastic with the mannequin! In fact, I liked the look so much that I just ordered the matching sitting mannequin. I can't wait until my next show so I can show off my new booth look! The only negative is that the mannequin is not 'dog' sized so I need to make customized clothing to fit the model. It will still show off my coats and dresses beautifully!Teafco Cleo Standing Leather Dog Mannequin"
5,Gitzo G1564L MK2 Studex XL Monopod,"I wanted a monopod that was tall, over 70"". This one is tall and it is built to last. It is excellent if you are willing to pay for this quality."
5,Great,I love these Orville Redenbacker Smart Cakes. They taste so much better than rice cakes & they are still a very healthy snack with very little fat and fairly low calories per serving. My husband thinks this butter flavor is a bit salty. I like it the way it is but it is not my favorite flavor. It's great for a change up from the other flavors though.
2,Kind of useful,"LW 8 Killer tips it's a beginner guide to some things that are already explained in the manuals. It's a fun to read, and has lot of illustrations. Don't expect too much knowledge in this book, just, like the name implies.... tips."
3,Useful as a reminder ; skip the bad humour,"Most of the Tips in this book are old news ; they are in fact plain features of the interface but are easily forgotten if you don't use them on a daily basis. So I found it somehow interesting as a reminder but too luxurious and therefore too expensive for this use.There is one thing I didn't like at all : the poor humour that opens almost every paragraph. The book would be better with more tips and less puns.I have one ""tip"" for this book : to find the tips relevant to a specific task, use the index, which is exhaustive and detailed, rather than the table of contents where only the ""funny"" and uninformative titles are listed."
4,Nice little book,"I like the fact that this book is in color. However while some of the tips were esoteric and useful, many others were very basic (and probably pretty commonly known I would think). One of the BEST books for Lighwave tips that I have ever read was ""1001 Tips & Tricks""...with that book I probably dog eared every other page ha ha!"
5,Shake those hips off,"This is a great little tape. A 'typical' aerobics tape targeting specific areas would bore me, but months later I still enjoy this tape and the others in the bellytwins' series. The tape isn't too intense, but incorporates some fun moves (hip circles, hip lifts and so on) into a 30-minute routine laced with dance moves. If you want to spend half an hour getting revitalized, stretched and toned lower-body wise, you can't beat this investment."
3,Good Workout/Bad Instruction,"As the reviews have stated, there is less concentration on the art of bellydance, and more focus on repetitive cardio--which was fine by me as I found this a desirable alternative to traditional aerobics. Neena and Veena are great, but I found the voiceover instruction to be annoying and vague--most of the instruction consists of a singsonging voice commanding, ""raise the knee and bounce up-down, up-down, up-down..."" but with no specifics on what to do with your other body parts. I think omitting the voiceover completely and simply following Neena and Veena would be good enough."
1,looks nice but no substance,"This video had a beautiful set and everything, but in truth the content was neither good belldance instruction, nor was it fitness. As a fitness junkie, I noticed some of the exercises and stretches were performed incorrectly. I think the girls were hired for their look, which makes this a nice video to watch but not a workout to actually do or learn from."
4,I LIKE IT,I LOVE WHEN THEY BOTH COME OUT AND DANCE. I ALSO LIKE THE TONING PLUS THE DANCE AT THE END.
5,Great Machine,"This is just a dandy little pressure washer! It is super easy to assemble and use, and does a great job on wood (my deck has never been so clean) and sidewalks/driveways. Just can't beat it for the price."
2,"Yes, it works, but watch out!","I, too, was completely satisfied with the efectiveness of this pressure washer(pw). However, during the first usage of my pw, the plastic intake connecting the hose to the compressor broke off without any undo tension on the hose. In fact, there was considerable slack left in the hose. Because I could not find the receipt, Karcher would not replace this equipment. Also, I sent an e-mail asking if they couldn't inspect my pw and determine its age or extent of usage. I got no reply(I did get a reply to an earlier e-mail). So, be careful when using this pw and save that receipt."
1,Bad Experience,"I was very happy that after several months trying to get the money to buy the ultimate motherboard I decide to get this one, but for my surprise this mobo came with troubles, the first days I didnt push it because I was checking the overall performance and installing my application, after all was done I started to play some games and bang, system shutdown, I though that the problem was with something I connected so I disassembly everything and tried again, but then the nightmare started, CPU INIT all the way in the back LCD, and no way to get rid of it, then I start looking some info over the internet and there were a lot of people with the same problem, and with no real solution for this (than to RMA the item back to the seller) I not telling that this is not a good choice but I will think twice if I will buy a mobo from asus, this one disappoint me"
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO ASUS?????,"the board was doa, I have sent it back to ASUS 3 times, just to receive it back in the same or worse condition. It was returned to me again a forth time....guess what? It still won't boot......I don""t understand what happened to ASUS but not only has the quality of their product become non-existent....and as far as customer service...what a joke....I have made every possible effort to discuss the problem but no one wants to hear it...and if I actually got to speak to someone...they have no answers....they said someone would call back...still waiting for that....maybe they will return my call sometime within the next century!!!!!"
4,good mobo little configuration gives the memories,mobo is very good buss touches to the 412 max unstable fbs 385 stablecongifugarion in in the memo has little since which does not accept very low times being uns memos alpha vx2 ocz ddr2 mhz1000 CL 4-4-4-15
5,Excellent Documentary,"This is great value for money,two DVD's covering the history and training of the U.S sniper,covers a timeline that starts with the Revolution right up to and including Iraq/Afghanistan,6 separate programs and 4.5 hours playing time... A bargain!"
2,"Sniper, Hidden Warrior",This isn't a movie like I thought.....It is a documentary from 1800's about snipers through today.....Good documentary though.....I don't recommend it movie wise.....
2,"Think ""maple syrup""","I won my first bike race in 1977 (unfortunately, I haven't won any since). Point is that I have been lubing for a long time. This lube is without a doubt the thickest and stickiest lube that I have ever used. It gummed up my jockey wheels very quickly to the point where the bike wouldn't shift properly. I won't use it anymore. Maybe it's better for people who are constantly riding in the wet. I do hate to bash a product, but what am I supposed to say?"
4,Good Chain Lube,"This oil is not like ""maple syrup"" as another reviewer stated. It's not even as viscous as typical 10w-40 automotive oil. It's definitely less thick and sticky than the typical lube that comes on new bikes. In summer 2009 I got a new low-cost mountain bike to ride as kind of a ""beater,"" and a bunch of dirt, leaves, etc stuck to the chain on my first ride.A good cleaning of the chain followed by an application of the Syn Lube was in order. The bottle has a nice tapered 'nozzle' to dispense the oil. Just it hold over the chain while cranking backward and squeeze lightly, the oil flows and coats the chain. Since doing this, in 3 months of riding, the chain is still relatively clean compared to one ride with the factory lube."
5,great product,"Again, Pedro's products, lubricants, and other, are among the best bike cleaning and maintenance products I have tried until today."
1,Operation Iraqi Freedom,"Do not buy this game! After a lengthy install, the game would not even load, but instead went to a black screen which I had to CAD out of. Piece of crap!!"
1,Dont buy it.,"Dont buy this game regardless of the reviews read,....unless of course, giving away money is your kind of thing."
4,Setting the review straight on this game,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers are thinking but:Pros: VERY realistic; This is a hard core sim game, plan on spending serious time learning the intricacies of the F-18's flight & weapons systems. This can be a deterrent if you have no patience or intellect. The handling & weapon systems are awesome! This game forces you to learn them and use them correctly or you will fail.My favorite part of this game is the mission editor, you can create killer custom missions!Cons: Lack of documentation, there is no online tutorial, or book that came with my CD. Learning everything through military friends as well as trial & error takes time. This game assumes you are familiar with a lot of what an F-18 pilot knows (weapon systems; radar sub-systems; etc)Net: In the end it is a great sim flight game that demands study & time but delivers a f-18 experience."
5,KICK BUM!,"From the great presentation, to the superb graphics, I advise NO ONE to miss out on this game. I saw it in the store at first, and blew it off as just another flight sim. But then, after playing it at a friend's house, I was blown away. The realism is intense and the models are amazing. Great attention to detail and physics were obviously taken into account in the creation of this game. I had previously played FA/18 Korea, but I didn't suspect that another title from this company was to be released. Upon my purchase, I have discovered this to be an even greater challenge and an even more inspiring flight simulation atmosphere. I highly reccomend this game, even to those who aren't big into flight sims. It will be well worth your time and purchase."
3,F18 operation Iraqi,Technical manual should have easier to use for training on the various weapon systemsA message should come up to let you know what wire was caught when you land on the carrierWould have been nice if air refueling was one of the training venue
2,Not a Sim...Closer to a Arcade Shooter,"It has the graphics and the flying feels right, but this is still in the Arcade class. Why show all the buttons on the HUD displays when they never intend for you to press them? Very little thinking is required, just throttle and shoot when the bells go off."
5,Sewable Swedish Paper - perfect!,"Perfect - I can see right thru it to trace out the original tissue paper pattern, can keep the original -well, ""original"". use it to make adjustments, durable enough to pin and drape for the adjustments.really fast delivery."
3,Sex comedy,"Hot Girls! Nicole Sheridan offers an excellent performance. Rebecca Love, the Queen, looks ridiculous, topless throughout and wearing a cape over oversized chest - needs a few acting lessons.Evan Stones's sex scenes were a bit comedic rather than stimulating."
3,"So, So...","This is a so so movie from Retromedia. In it two busty babes must travel from an all female planet to find male specimens on Earth to mate with to save their race. The cast is comprised of beauties Nicole Sheridan, Syren, Christine Nguyen, Michelle Lay, and the every sexy Rebecca Love. The acting is mediocre and the sex scenes are sub par. The reason for my purchase was this was one of the first movies I saw with naked ladies a few years back. Rediscovering it on Amazon was back memories of the years before my discovery of the ""internet"". hahaha I do suggest it because it is funny to watch and the ladies are pretty fine too!"
3,Typical 70's movie,"Fun, cute, silly to say the least, but it is entertaining and there is T&A for those who need some eye candy."
3,Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet,"Cute, but it's really short on any type of plot. Lot of TNA and not much else. The film is good for a laugh and not much else."
1,"As bad as ""Ghost teeny bikini""",This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I do not recomend it to anyone. It was just plain silly. I lost the silver. Open TV and schedule for children is more softcore than in this bad movie.So Long.GGL
3,Flick is a bit outa this world,Fans of the Bikini series will have plenty of nasty stuff on their menu with this entry. Nichole Sheridan plays a student bod who is screwing with her professor to change her grades. Christine Nguyen is an alien from the lesbian planet who (for reviewers who keep score tabs on the scenes) is in a two boys with two girls while girl kisses girl!
1,Wrong information,"Just reading the page preview permitted by Amazon to determine if you want to order the book, I see misinformation. ""Probably Blenko"" doesn't show a lot of research. One piece of glass marked ""probably Blenko"" is Kanawha and is in their old catalogs. I have one in green and another in brown. I do give kudos to the authors for actually interviewing the folks at Hamon Glass. And the spelling for the owners of Kanawha should be Merritt."
5,My wife is a collector and she loves it,We can finally value our collection. When we see crackle in antique stores we have a good idea of what it is worth.
5,Gettin' down in Dixie,"The best I've heard since the plane went down in the swamp in October of '77. Southern Boogie at its finest. Mixed as if done by Mr. Dowd himself. This one is top notch. Chris' first sounds like a mix of Skynyrd, Wet Willie, Toy Caldwell and Steve Gaines! Flowing up from the South and getting down. The best I've heard. This one is a must own for anybody into rock-n-roll from the South. The title kinda threw me, but I get it now. Macon Georgia has a Broadway, don't ya know! Pick it, Wilson!!!!!!"
5,HIlarious.,You will laugh so hard at this movie; I guarantee it. Definitely worth a viewing. Movies don't get much worse -- or hilarious -- than this.
1,My thoughts on KILLJOY,Hmmmmm....... I don't know about this movie. Although it was kind of funny. It was the worst movie ever...where did they find these actors? You may get some good laughs from this movie..but if you are looking to be scared. This is not the movie for you.
1,not scary,This is the worst film i've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Killjoy wouldn't scare me even if he was real!!!!!!!!
1,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"The only good point of watching this movie is its kinda funny...too bad it isn't a comedy. The acting was awful, the story was awful, and I've seen better special effects in movies made 20 years ago! I thought the effects would at least be good because it was recently made. Unless you want a good movie to make fun of, don't watch it."
1,this movie [stinks],"This movie was really [bad], along with most of the other fullmoon movies. With the exception of the puppet master series and the dead hate the living. This is about a clown who is brought to life by a tormented boy. It ride around an his ice cream truck while picking up his victims and sending them to killjoy world. Though it is [junk] you might get a few laughs out of it."
3,Indians of the Pacific Northwest,"I originally ordered this book because I was researching something. I didn't find it in this book, however. It is an older version of anthropology, easy reading and doesn't broach itself into some subjects that some of our elders find intrusive and/or inappropriate for publication."
4,This one was very good!,This #3 in the Landry series was very good! It had lots of unexpected twists & turns & the 2nd half of the book kept me on the edge of my seat! This was well worth my time & money!
4,A good read!,I love the Landry series.I have read all the books in this series and I have to say books one and two are the best.But the others are good too!Everyone should read this story.
1,Poor Paul,"I think this book is just sick. It left me with a queasy feeling in my stomach. When i read Ruby, i felt somewhat sympathetic to Ruby and all her problems....but not anymore. How could she screw Paul that way when he was willing to go against his mother's wishes and nature itself to make her happy. Paul reminds me so much of a Troy. Unlike Troy, he was willing to forget their relation fast enough and was strong enough to accept it. This whole thing sucks...Ruby changes places w/ her invalid twin so that she could be with the man that took advantage of her? She leaves Paul taking care of Giselle...imagining it was really Ruby he was taking care of. I just feel so sorry for Paul that he was abused by Ruby in such a cruel way. This book is pure torture and I really don't recommend it for people who like Paul's character."
3,This book could have been better,So many V C Andrews books just blow you away. This one just kind of sat there. It was very predictable and obvious. Who would have sex with a man they KNEW was their brother? YUK!!! I don't think the ghost writer is nearly as good as the original author.
2,"Good style, weak plot","I read every single V.C. Andrews novel and I dare to say that they went downhill right from here. The first two Landy books were good - they were similar to the other series but there was something charming about it, also, I liked Ruby's character. In this book, I honestly wanted to kick her butt.First of all - why did she marry Paul? She knew not only that he is her brother, but also that he is deeply in love with her. Secondly - this whole pretending-to-be-Gisselle was ridiculous. Everyone knew how different these twins were despite their looks. Ruby behaved selfish throughout the entire book, so did Beau. And all of the others died, I think ... is that supposed to be a plot?! The style is good - but that is not enough to create a good book.Stick to ""Flowers in the attic"" and the original VCA-novels. You will be disappointed with this one."
4,It was okay,"It's not as good as the other books in the Landry series, but it's okay. The reason its not as good is because Ruby's twin sister, Gisselle was killed and so was her stepmother Daphne and the series just wasn't the same without these two characaters. I also think that Ruby mistreated Paul"
5,"One of the most captivating, and emotional books ever.","The whole Landry series is I think the best that VC Andrews have ever written, but in ""All That Glitters"", It really makes you want to cry, scream, and smile all at once. The great dercriptivness and emotional feeling that paul, ruby, and beau share is very powerful and captivating. I finished this book in one night, because I just couldn't put it down!"
3,The more you read the better it gets,"A very good book, I really recomend it I just can't wait to see whats gonna happen in the next book. I love all the V.C Andrews novels, but the best serie is the one about Melody: Melody, Heart song, Unfinished symphony and Music in the night wich I have'nt read yet but I know I'll love it !!"
5,Suspenseful,"All that Glitters, begins a year after Ruby returns to Houma, and gives birth to Pearl. The book is very suspense-filled, and has many dark chills in it. It is sort of like a soap opera. But it has the same senario as all of past V.C. Andrews books. What makes it fun, is that it takes place in the swamps of the bi-yu!!!I found it suspenseful and faced-paced because, in the first half of the book, Ruby marries her half-brother, Paul. But they keep their distance from each other! Still they both pretend Pearl is their child, and they reside, in the deep swamps of Houma.All of a sudden that brick wall falls, and Ruby is living with Beau in New Orleans, as her twin sister Giselle.There is a chilling climax that will leave you reading the last three chapters without putting the book down. You will enjoy it!Although you might think Ruby is a little self-ish to the people who love her the most."
2,"disappointing, and it is part a long line of cliches","After reading the Dollanger(?) series, the Casteel, Cutler and even ""My Sweet Audrina"", I found the Landry series to be lacking in originality, plot, and the climaxes left something to be desired. I was an avid reader of V.C. Andrews for a very long time and collected all the books up to the 3rd Landry. It was all so depressing and unoriginal that I couldn't bring myself to read anymore. The author killed off so many key characters that it was really hard to finish the book. Also, I found myself actually disliking the heroine for all her weaknesses despite her hardships. I would like to say this though, all the books before this were well-written, had likeable characters that the reader could relate with, and were all around DAMN GOOD BOOKS!!!!!!!!"
5,WOW!!!!,"All That Glitters is by far one of V.C. Andrews best books, with all the compasssion, forbidden desires, and drama this book is definately one you'll read over and over again! :)"
2,All The Same All The Time,"I have to agree with ariley, ricepad and brownsa. I really enjoyed the first couple maybe even three family series but it quickly became obvious that V.C. Andrews only knew how to blow ""one note"". Makes you wonder if she was living out some sick fantasy or trying to exercise some private demons of her own. Then the publishers went to great pains to find writers to fill the void when Ms. Andrews died. I would like to see these ""ghost writers"" give the fans something more true to life. Most of us are women, some of us have had hard lives or gotten some bad breaks but we endure and are strong and can lead happy lives, with or without men.I know my review wasnt very complementary and I will continue reading V.C. Andrews books but I wont pay full price for them."
2,All that glitters ain't Gold!!!,"All that Glitters was so boring and predictable. The story is so weak. Who didn't see that Ruby was going to change identities with her twin sister? Such a lame, unimaginative, boring, predictable book. I didn't even like the characters. I was not at all sympathetic toward Paul. And why does the incest theme run throughout this book? I'm giving it a 4, because it was better than the Cutler series!"
2,"Same as all the other books, but with different characters","I was extremely disappointed with this book. I have read every VC Andrews book and they all seem to blend together. In every book, there is a girl who has a really hard life, gets raped or abused by someone extremely close to her (ie father, uncle, etc.), finds out that the people she believed was her family is NOT, finds out she is actually very rich, and has some sort of incestuous realtionship with her brother because it was too late when her real identity was discovered. The sad part is that this occurs in every book in one form or another. The daughter always repeats her mother's mistakes. I think it's time to think of a new plot or stop writing these books all together. I do not find these enjoyable anymore because I know what exactly is going to happen."
1,auto coaster,"I was very surprised once i got the coaster, its very small so that's why its universal it likes to move around in my cup holders. I was expecting it to be a higher quality product since i payed so much for it. It almost looks as if a high school student made it in ceramics class. i don't recommend this product."
1,this toy stinks,this toy stinks because it is all ways falling apart and i would give it no stars if i got a chance too
5,R is for Rhyme,Beautiful book that describes all types of poetry with explanations that are both easy and also for older students.
4,my gift,"Lovely gift. Was impressed with the presentation. However, there was no packing inside the box to prevent it from shaking. also it would have been nice to know the wrist size which is recommended for the watch."
3,Under-boiled attempt at film noir,"An average movie at best. Average acting, average script, average action. There are much, much better french film noir out there, including the great Bob le Flambeur (by Melville himself), Touchez Pas Au Grisbi (with Gabin), and Rififi.Even Melville Le Cercle Rouge and Army of Shadws are better than this film. It just doesn't have alot to offer."
4,Le Doulos,"A ""doulo"" is a hat in French slang. In the French underworld argot, it also mean ""informer"" and this is the story of an interrupted crime broken up by the police responding to an informer. The movie revolves around how one of the criminals attempts to get revenge on the informer. Jean-Paul Belmondo stars in this suspense directed by Jean-Pierre Melville."
3,An early Melville film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Le Doulos is an early film by Jean Pierre Melville. It follows two criminals and their actions. One is thought to be police informant too, hence the title, which in French means ""informant"" and its English title, The Finger Man.The DVD contains the theatrical trailer, new interviews with German director, Volker Schlöndorff and Bertrand Tavernier who worked on the film, archival interviews with Melville and actors Jean-Paul Belmondo and Serge Reggiani, and partial length audio commentary by Melville biographer, Ginette Vincendeau."
3,Eat Dangerously,"I expected better, nothing was really over the top.Alot of money for what you got, I can go on line to2-3 recipe sites and probably find more excitingrecipes. I am a home cook who dabbles in gourmet cooking"
4,Prismatic Delight For All People!,"This is a fantastic book, featuring interesting, and intriguing, gay/lesbian characters, especially the main ""hero"" Greg. The chapters are short, and easy to read, though the writer has written the novel in ""present tense"" (which was a little off-putting in the beginning), the story flows very well, and figuratively swallows you in the story...."
2,I was very disapointed.,"I was very diapointed, the author displays her lack of knowledge in both weight training and fighting arts through out the book. Most of the information in the book could be learned from taking ten minutes with a fitness instructor on any gym floor. I was also disapointed that the author was neither an experineced martial artist or a certified personal trainer. I believe that one would better spend your money on a subscription to MA Training magazine, where you will get both experience and certification. I feel I can say these things after 20 years of training, Black belt holder in several styles, and I am also a certified personal trainer."
1,Disappointing and Misleading.,"The previous reviewer is correct in stating your money is better spent in a gym or on MA Training magazine. The author's lack of credibilty on this subject should be apparent to anyone with knowledge of martial arts. There are absolutely no exercises that focus on body balance, an essential for martial arts training. Even worse, anyone knowledgeable about weight training should be able to see that most of the exercises are minimal and incomplete, and will most likely lead to underdevelopment in martial arts conditioning. A far better manual for martial arts students looking to develop strength would be Harry Wong's Dynamic Strength, or Loren Christensen's The Way Alone."
4,Great Mixed Bag,"Picked this collection up cheap. For the price I paid, just the inclusion of one song that I especially enjoyed would be worth it. Well, while there are a few not-so-great tunes, this is still a pretty good collection for casual listening. And, there was one that I especially loved - ""Runaway '67"" by Del Shannon. While one reviewer panned it, I though it was a great re-do - and one that I had never heard before. Most pleased with this collection!"
2,Don't let the image fool you.,"So I ordered this because my monitor cable is a 15 Prong? D-Sub cable and that type of cable will connect to my tv, but a vga cable (which looks identical) doesn't work. The picture for the item clearly shows 3 rows of 5 prongs? each but the cable I recieved had only two rows, one of 8 and one of 7. So needless to say it wasn't what I expected or needed. The only plus is the expected 2-4 weeks shipping time turned out to take less than a week."
1,A monument to bad taste and artistic pretension,"If John Lennon deserves any credit at all for his assault on the ears of his fans with an avante-garde (that's French for 'pretentious garbage') work devoid of any aesthetic value, it's for his having had the courage to release what he thought at the time was 'art' in the knowledge that it would be universally panned. And panned it deserved to be. This should have remained a personal fun project between him and Yoko that stayed in the bedroom and never saw the light of day. If I were ever forced at gunpoint to listen to either this album again or Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, I'd go for Lou's monstrosity any day. Yes, it's that bad."
1,Capitol Records Does It Again!,"THIS, they release. ""Digitally remastered"". Great. But the first four Beatle albums in stereo? Forget it! Not commercially viable I suppose.Unlike this masterpiece. Who runs that company anyway?"
1,They wouldn't let me give less stars,"Hey. For half the price of this CD, I'll send you a CD of myself and my wife repeating our names, reading stuff, making noises. I'll even include a bonus disk of my flatulent toots. Maybe I'll throw my cat in the washing machine and create another YUCKO song."
2,Unfinished Music No.3,"The third in a series of anti-popstar releases designed to, and largely successful in, knocking John Lennon off the pedestal his fans had erected for him. With his new avant-garde wife at his side -- and enough money in the bank to last a lifetime -- Lennon set about ruining his bank value so he could return to being a 'private citizen.' All three albums -- Two Virgins, Life With The Lions & Wedding Album -- are potent reminders of a simpler time when artists could experiment wildly (or just be very silly) and still get released and distributed (erm, somewhat). Rykodisc nicely duplicates the original packaging and the remastered sound quality is, for 1967, pretty darn good.Of course you can't actually LISTEN to this stuff...."
2,The Ballad of John and Yoko,"I checked this album out from the local library. I can not give this album a great rating because it puts me to sleep! Get ""Imagine"". It's a better album."
1,Yoko's Mistake,"A better package then a record-""The Wedding Album"" containsno music-just the Lennon's shouting out eachother's name for themost part.Even a nice interview album wouldv'e been genius compared to this foolish over indulgance.Better stick to thepair's innovative solo albums."
4,Best Little Pest Eradicator on the Planet,"This album and particularly the track ""Don't Worry Kyoko-mummy's only out looking for her hand in the snow..."" is the best way I know to rid your yard of woodchucks, chipmunks or neighborhood cats. Simply place speakers close to an open window, crank up the decibel level and let Yoko do her magic. Have some relatives or so-called friends who refuse to leave? Download this track and play it full tilt with great pride. Your guests are guaranteed to leave within the hour. Also guaranteed to break single-paned glass and clear out stubborn clogged drains. Not for the faint of heart.P.S. Dear Yoko, Pretentiousness is not Art."
1,"8, 5 star ratings LOL","I'll keep it simple, historically this is one of the worst LP's ever made! It was a joke made to show the world that stupid Beatles fans would buy anything. Well they didn't, this is also one of the worst selling LP's of all time. So 8 different yahoo's rave this CD up like it's some kind of art form. Yea the jokes on you! LOL."
3,The Most Accessible Of All John/Yoko Avant Garde Releases...,"The Wedding Album is probably the most accessible of the early avant garde albums that John and Yoko made together, mainly because of the inclusion of several interviews they did while they were having their bed-in. It gives you a nice insight into what they were thinking while they were doing it.The other track is a nice lovey-dovey avant garde track with John and Yoko continually shouting each others names.It's definitely the most accessible of all their early releases, but if you know you hate it already, don't bother buying it."
4,A Classic,"There are some really great tunes on this album. Well ... not exactly. This is one of those CDs or albums, as you like, that if you are a fan you just have to collect. My original copy is on vinyl and in a big white box. Lot's of dust on it. Got some extra money? Go ahead and get it on CD. Nobody is really looking or are they? John, you made me take a second look there for a second."
2,Neat stuff.,"Neat stuff came in the lp, Don't know about the cd. the lack of any songs and yoko doing her thing was pretty bad. If a fan buy it ,If not stay away."
2,"Boring, except for the end, if you can make it","I rented this video from the library so thankfully I lost no money. I was expecting a fun belly dancing video. Instead, I found myself slowing moving, repeatedly and bouncing on one leg. You never really get to dance, and it is not an instructional video. I was extremely bored with it."
1,Booooorrrring,"This video features all of about three moves, and not even any simple combinations. There is no motivation--the instructors don't even instruct--this is all done via voiceover. Stretching is poor--areas that are worked out extensively in the aerobic portion aren't even stretched prior. No focus or direction on form, either. One section had you moving with your finger stuck to your forehead for about five minutes. Even if you're a beginner, I wouldn't bother. I also own the Goddess Workout and, while it's a little cheesy, it's alot more fun--and I had never bellydanced before in my life!"
1,A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"The description on the back of this video should have simply said, ""You will hop around on one foot, then switch and repeat for a little less than a half an hour. All this will be accompanied by cheesy, annoying music. You will feel robbed of your money.""In all fairness, I haven't seen the other videos in this series, but this one sure doesn't make me want to give them a try."
2,"Not bellydance, and not necessarily ""beginner""","I was disappointed in this video. It seemed promising at first, but the moves were extremely repetitive. While it is a workout video for cardio, not an instructional dance video, it is still listed as a ""bellydance"" video. It really isn't. It is a good cardio workout once it gets going if you don't mind the tedium of doing the same move over and over. It starts very slowly though. And as it is all up on your toes and hopping around, it causes a great deal of strain on the calves. I'm rather fit, and I was still so sore in the calves the next two days that I walked funny. In short, there are many many exercise videos that are more balanced, more interesting with variation, and not so straining on one particular area when it's supposed to be an all-over cardio workout."
1,Unimaginative,"I was very disappointed in this video, I have all the other Bidasha twin videos, but this one was very unimaginative. They keep doing one step over and over ..... this video is not worth it .... try any of the other bellydance videos ... just skip this one"
1,This is NOT bellydance!!,"The set was nice, and the instructors were cheerful, but bellydancing is NOT jumping and hopping around on one leg, then the other. It should be classified under aerobics, and have NO bellydancing whatsoever in the title.I have taken bellydance lessons in a classroom format, and at NO time, did we jump around like cheerleaders.A total disappointment."
4,Great and fun beginning exercise video,"I really enjoyed this tape. I haven't done the rest of the series, but I thought this would be a fun way to work out while I was traveling. I'm pretty athletic and have dance experience, and this raised my heart rate. This won't teach you to belly dance, but it is ""dance-y."" There is a lot of jumping, as people pointed out, but it's very easily modified and made low-impact. The twins looked lovely, in an attainable and real way. I didn't mind the voice-over, as some people did."
1,Not recommended,"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers.This video was very boring, repetitive, and not terribly physically sound.I felt very silly during the exercises where I had to keep my finger stuck to my forehead, and although I turned it off (and returned it to the store) after 15 minutes of hopping, I was still stuck with extremely sore calves.Also, I don't see any reason to put the word ""Bellydancing"" on the front, because as I understand it, this is more based on Egyptian folk-dancing.Come on, V & N! You can do better!"
2,Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Fat Burning,"I agree with the person expressing dissappointment. Repititious, tedious hopping and a strain on the joints to say the least. I have taking bellydance classes and have worked out my whole life. This tape bored me as I was expecting to learn some other moves... also, I strained my right calf muscle so much, I could barely walk for a week."
4,BURNS FAT!!!!!,"I am really amused by alot of the other reviews, this video is for FAT BURNING (see title) not for learning sexy moves. And it does make your heart rate go up and you DO work up a good sweat. I am not as cardiovascular fit as the twins but I do the moves at my own pace and pause if I need to and still get a great workout. If you are looking to exercise then do buy their line of exercise videos, if you are trying to learn sexy bellydance then simply buy their teaching videos, its not that hard to figure out. I have their line of exercise vids and one of their teaching vids and I use the exercise ones the most because that is what I am trying to do. Exercise. I recommend all their exercise vids."
1,Definitely not for people who want to walk!,"This thirty minute tape contains mainly silly one-legged jumps that can kill your calves and feet! This is Veena and Neena's worst tape, in my opinion! Bottom line: Leave this tape in the store!"
2,too hard for beginners,"I found this video to be too hard for beginners, aka someone who isnt in the best of shape. My lungs could not keep up with the moves. Not only that, but it is also pretty boring. I bought bellydancing videos hoping to learn a few exotic moves from each one, but this one had none to speak of. Its been sitting on my shelf for almost a year, but I love the other videos done by Neena and Veena."
2,Could had been good!,"Lots of interesting things happen in this book, it could had been a good story but it had too much unbelivable things that happen. The book is easy to read, it surprise me at how fast I could read it but feeling that the book was not good enough, something is messing, I don't know what it is coz the idea is good, I like to care for the characters when I read a book but this didn't make me care for them has much has I want too, the atmostphere in this story was creepy but again something is missing. Maybe the characters were not explore enough, Grace was a very good character but again something is missing. To much useless talked in this book. The book could had been a good one if wrote better."
1,"too many ingredients, too much time","It seems that these recipes were written by either mothers of college kids or 70 year old sophomores. Two recipes for LIVER? Come onnnn. Most of the recipes have 6 - 9, even 14 ingredients. A coed is never going to buy so many ingredients called for in this book, let alone a guy. I bought this for my niece and I decided to give it to her as a gag gift, writing my own takes on some recipes. They may taste delicious (except the liver) but even I don't want to take the time."
1,complicated,I bought this as a gift for my brother who is 19 and just moved into his first apartment as a college sophomore - and I'm NOT giving it to him. The recipes are way too complicated and require too many ingredients. I don't even have all the ingredients a few of the recipes need!!Would not recommend.
1,NOT a Microwave Cookbook,"I was very disapointed when this book came in the mail. I looked up microwave cookbooks and this one popped up. There is not a SINGLE recipe in it that is for microwaves. It may be a great book but beware, if you are looking for a microwave cookbook this is not the one for you."
3,Meh,Cole Porter collections are a dime-a-dozen. This one is mostly mediocre. Better versions of these songs are available elsewhere surely.
2,Disappointed,"After seeing the motion picture ""De-Lovely"" and reading several Cole Porter bio's, I eagerly anticipated listening to ""Capitol Sings Cole Porter: Anything Goes"". Although the Capitol CD contains many more selections by competent, well known artists, I much prefer listening to the CD from the soundtrack of the movie. The ""Capitol Sings..."" arrangements are slick, but to my ear the De-Lovely arrangements are more wonderfully crafted and have a much more sensuous, emotional quality, even when sung by non-singers Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd. Diana Krall's interpretation of ""Begin the Beguine"", along with the gorgeous minor key accompaniment, is worth the ownership of the CD alone. I find it to be nothing less than thrilling, no matter how often one listens. I gave my ""Capitol Sings..."" CD away."
5,The world has gone mad today,"Cole Porter was one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th Century. This CD features Capitol Records artists singing his songs. All of the singers here are good, although some are better than others. And some of the arrangements are a bit on the dull side. It's noteworthy that one of Capitol's biggest stars, Frank Sinatra, is not included here. Most of the singers here are women, but you can't complain about the likes of Annie Ross, Peggy Lee and Judy Garland. Highly recommended."
2,a disappointment,"I own another oxo tea kettle and was looking for a solid stainless steel replacemeny. Unfortunately, this kettle was a disappointment. It is very light weight, took 12 minutes to heat the water to boiling (following the manufacturers directions), and worst of all the whistle was so soft I couldn't hear it! Needless to say it was returned. On the positive side the handle only got warm and the click spout worked well."
3,Part Pathetic. Part good.,"The Founding Fathers and Founding Brother discs seem to be focused and designed to slander small government Jefferson and idolize huge government Hamilton (Who actually wanted to have an American KING, but they don't mention that here). As I said in other reviews, those particular discs are best used as coasters while you watch the others.Most of the remaining stuff is very well done, although they really are sympathetic towards and go out of their way to justify the traitorous actions of Benedict Arnold. He started out a great patriot, but in the end, a traitor is a traitor, not a hero. There are many ignored founders who are FAR more worthy of that kind of attention."
5,Who Are You?,"The Givers and Takers is a clear concise study of human nature. After reading the book I was able to understand what makes realtionships ""tick"". A must read for healthier and happier realtionships.Lakewood, CA"
3,OK for Trey,A standard album for Trey. Much more generic than most of his other music. Yet still good music.
4,Trey Anastasio 's Latest CD is a Hidden Gem,"My favorite track is ""Shine"", full of positive energy to lift the spirit on any 'energetic' task. I had never heard of Anastasio until I happened upon this album and was happily suprised by his band's energy.If you have trouble purchasing this album because of Sony's ""virus"" bug on the CD, I recommend you buy the individual tracks on-line like I did from iTunes, MusicMatch, or MSN..no problems at all !Keep up the great uplifting writing Trey !"
1,Adult Contemporary Garbage,"If you like Michael Bolton, Bryan Adams, the Gin Blossoms, and Santana's album Supernatural, then this groovy album is for you!"
1,Tottaly not worth it!,"I bought this cage for my son and at first it seemed nice but it was not worth $15.99!It was way too small,the food dish always came off,the water bottle always leaked"
3,nice hampster cage,my mommy got me this for my hampster cause his cage was so small so we added the tube on the side to connect it to the big cage. this cage is nice cause i can bring it with me and it has a handle too. it has a water bottle food plate and a wheel but my hampster is so big he falls out of the wheel some times. and i dont like the water bottle cause doesnt stop dripping so his woodchips are wet.
3,Tiny!,"I bought this recently (not from here) and I just don't think the price is worth what the size is. This cage is only good for baby hamsters or Robos. If I were you, I'd wait for it to go on sale."
1,Glass Shattered!!!!,"Bought this set less than 2 weeks ago, got it out... LOVED IT! Beautiful!!! Used the pots and pans, and all have seemed great. Today, for the first time used the small pot and put the lid on it to boil water to make mac n cheese for my kid.... then after a few minutes heard a HUGE POP!! I thought my son threw his train at the back door... then look at the pot and the glass is shattered into a thousand pieces!!! Awful, I am scared to use the rest.. and i am returning first thing tomorrow!"
2,"Pots are great, Pans thumbs down",Love the pots they have lasted over 3 years and are going strong. The Pans on the other hand only lasted 6 months and the non-stick was gone. Everything stuck to them and we had to throw them out. Love the handles as they never get hot.
3,Handle attachment,"I recently purchased this set after reading several reviews.I like the shape,weight, and volume of these pans.The orange handles add a little color;however the way the handles are attached to the pans make it difficult to clean,especially when making sauces."
3,Hard to clean undersides of pans,"I have owned these pans for 6 months. I love the non stick cooking surface. The pans are a little small but they cook evenly. I haven't been able to clean the cooked on stains on the bottom of the pans. I don't want to scratch the finish, so I've tried baking soda, bartenders friend and kitchen soap. No luck and it makes the pans look dirty.Does anyone have any ideas?"
2,The pans warp and the finish scrubs off over time,"I have had the Rachael Ray cookware set for about two years. The large oval frypan has warped beyond use - it wobbles ridiculously on my stove, with no even heat whatsoever. All of the frypans have warped to the point where I've had to toss them. Also, the outside of every pan is now a streaked black-white from washing.Never again will I buy (at $279)cookware that doesn't have a solid stainless steel bottom attached."
1,loved them for one year,"When I first got these pans I was soooo excited! They were beautiful! The food didnt stick! I wasnt thrilled I had to hand wash them, but they were still wonderful. Then after one year, I noticed the finish on the inside was peeling! Now of course I am worried it got in our food! I took care of it exactly as it said in the directions. If I knew this was going to happen before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it! I still love Rachael Ray though!"
3,High Heat,"I received these pans as a Christmas gift and really like them, but when I read the instructions, you cannot cook on high heat or use cooking oils or sprays? I takes forever to boil noodles. They are very nice pans though. I would get them again and I spoonulas ROCK!"
3,Adequate but lightweight,"I was a little disappointed in the weight of the cookware - I was used to Cook's Essentials stainless steel which were much heavier. For the price, Rachael Ray's cookware is adequate but I don't think I would purchase them again."
4,Love them,I love them! I do have to admit the Orange made me think twice but I enjoy them so muce it doesn't matter! They ARE easy to clean!
5,They are a fantastic cooking set,"This set was truly great I was skeptical in buying them since I read a couple of negative experiences some about the pans being bent others about the MEDIUM only heating. Well my set came in perfect. My two year likes to play with them and they have not scratched, bent or anything. They cook great and yes it does say to cook on medium heat only but because they condense heat so well you don't need anything higher than medium or medium high, which sometimes I'll use because I'm trying to rush things. On medium it would heat just fine. I do use siicone spoons and spatula's so they don't scratch. Also, they are fantastic because you don't have to use oil most pans cause the oil to get absorbed onto your food these don't. Last of all they are so easy to clean, you take a napkin clean it out then just wash it, not a single thing gets stuck on them. I have absolutely no negative things to say about them. I LOVE THEM!"
5,Love my Rachael Ray Cookware,"I am not really one who likes to be in the kitchen. However, once I got my new cookware I find myself wanting to cook. This cookware set is great to cook in especially easy to clean because nothing sticks to them. I am VERY happy with my purchase and believe that you will be to."
5,Mom's bday gift,"Loving it, no complains and cleaning is very easy. It's sturdy and the instructions say do not use in a dishwasher, but I have placed these in a dishwasher and they are completely fine."
5,Easy to use and clean,"I bought my boyfriend this set for Christmas and we have thoroughly enjoyed them. They are very easy to cook on, and the different sizes are great. Best feature is how easy they clean up after usage!"
5,Rachel Rocks!!!,"I'm loving to cook again!!! These are so great for cooking quickly, serving easily, and cleaning up in a snap. Really worth the money."
5,10 Piece Cookware,Owned many cookware sets over the years. This is by far the best. Even cooking and easy clean up.
1,Disappointed,"I was pretty disappointed when I received my order of this 10 piece Hard Anodized Aluminum cookware. I thought for the name and price, the aluminum in this set would be a heavier gauge metal than what it is. My old 8"" and 10"" Ware-Ever frying pan's have aluminum twice then these new Rachael Ray cookware. To top it off, the bottom of the 10"" covered Saute pan isn't flat! Gee, I wondered why it wobbled on the table after unpacking it. Don't they have any quality control!! Could have shop Walmart and got the same quality and save money."
4,"Great cookware, great price, but ...","Everything cooks great in these pots and pans, nothing sticks (ever), and they're super easy to clean. You can't beat Amazon's price, either. But I really wish that the 6-quart covered stockpot that comes with the set were just a little larger ... maybe 8 quart, like my previous set by a different manufacturer. The 6-quart is just too small to cook a family-size (4 quart) portion of soup. Once you put in the meat and vegetables, you're all the way to the top of the pot, just waiting to boil over! And the sides of the skillets angle inwards, so the space at the bottom is small ... forget making two grilled cheese sandwiches at once, even in the larger skillet (12"") that is sold separately."
5,The Truth,"I give this set 5 stars, but dont buy from here. I bought this set from amazon and paid almost twice what they cost at sam's club. my fault, but pans themselves are great."
5,Cookware review,"I absolutely love the nonstick hard anodized cookware set. Easy to clean & take care of; however, be very aware NOT to spray cooking spray in them as this hidden fact is not well publicized (in my opinion). The only issue is that I wish the set had a 12"" skillet. The larger 14 piece set didn't really give you any more usable pieces for the significantly higher price tag. I will have to individually purchase a few pieces to complete a cookware set that is perfect for me. But I am very happy with it & it is also lightweight enough that you don't need to lift weights to use the cookware! Definitely would purchase again!"
2,Not a long lasting product,I bought this set 5 years ago and had to toss the pots and pans out today. The dark coating on the bottoms of the pans and pots is starting to come off and appears scratched. I never used metal spatulas or spoons when cooking. Also the finish on the outside of the pans and pots faded within one year. Very poor quality for the money.
1,Do Not Buy,These are the worst pots ever. The handles get hot and you will burn yourself when you touch the handles. You need pot holders to touch the handles. THe bottom of the pans scratch with your first use. This celeb should be ashamed of herself that she has endorsed these pots. I can not believe this set has received high reviews from other people. I would give it no stars but this review system would not let me.
4,good for everyday,low priced cookware for everyday use; especially when you have teenagers using your pots & pans; did notice that teflon did scratch easily...I hope that doesn't become a problem.
5,Awesome!,"The cookware is durable, colorful, and easy to clean. The only downside is that they are not dishwasher safe, so I have to clean them by hand. I've been using them a lot since I received them at Christmas. I've found that in these pots, pasta cooks evenly. This set of pans are heavy but not extremely heavy...they are very well-made. The pots are very tall and fit perfectly on the burners. I recommend these to everyone.I've read some reviews of these pots adhering to the ceramic cook tops but the only way I see this happening is if they are placed in an extremely hot oven and then placed on a cold stove top....even that is just an assumption based on the instructions provided in the set.I can't praise this set of cookware enough."
5,Wonderful Cookware!,I bought this set when it was on sale for $119.00. What an amazing deal! Competitor stores had this same set for $200 then you have to pay for shipping. Great quality! Thanks again amazon!
5,Awesome cookware at a decent price,I bought this set about a month ago at Linens N Things (I used one of their 20% off coupons...great savings!). I love these pots and pans. They're very easy to clean and they heat very evenly. I've never had a problem with them and I am so glad I bought them. I think they compare to some of the $300 sets I've seen. This set is awesome for someone who is just getting into cooking as well as a pro. I'm very happy with my purchase!
1,not made well,I have had this set for a year. I am now buying a new set. The protective coating has come off. It has been hand washed only. It was not made well. I was very disappointed. Do not buy this set.
1,inexpensive pots and pans,One of the frying pan was out of shape (not round). The rest of the set seemed thin and not a high quality. I would think this would be a good starter set for someone who is just setting up a new household but you will need to replace it in a couple of years. I returned this set.
2,Loved It Before It Started Peeling,"I have had this set for about a year and a half. My favorite pan is the 10 inch covered skillet which I use 3-5 days per week. I loved it...great size, nothing sticks, cooks evenly. Now there are little holes all over the bottom where the coating is peeling off. I have not used metal utensils and have only hand washed this pan. I will not use it anymore because I know the coating is now ending up in my food. All the other pans are in great shape, but I do not use them nearly as often."
2,Should have read the small print...,"hand wash. If I had seen that, I would not have purchased this product (admit, my fault). I prefer cookware that works for me, not cookware that I have to baby. And if by chance you forget and stick it in the dishwasher, it takes the outer finish off."
1,They DO NOT LAST!,I've had these pans for 4 years and they all have peeling on the insides. The worst are the skillets! I have never put them in the dishwasher or on high heat. I loved these pans for the first 1-2 years and now they look horrible!! Even the outside has changed so much that they look like there 100 years old. Don't waste your money!!!
4,Not quite what I thought,"My only complaint is that I didn't see where ""nonstick"" was written at the very bottom of the page, and I definitely did not want nonstick pots. They are fine, however, even if not what I had wanted or would have bought had the information been clearer"
5,cooking gem,"I love the whole Rachael Ray set. I cant imagine cooking without them. all the years my food burned to my old pots, and I could never get them cleaned. Not the case with these. good product."
4,Happy with purchase,"Overall, I am pleased with the cookware set. It is light weight, heats quickly, and nothing sticks. It's good quality for the price."
